I've been watching the harassment for some months now and I'm glad to see the organization finally steped up. It's a reputation attack on the organization, but the full brunt of it has fallen on one dev. The primary motivation for the attacks was to discredit Tor with inept concern trolling. That expanded to personal harrassment of one dev, chosen because of her work on Tor, because she is a woman, and because she was accessable. The ring leaders are journalists for a popular news outlet, supported by a mob of  MRA conspiracy fascists. Related: "I don't take those Pando writers seriously at all. I found the innuendo they spewed to be baseless and reckless. But I answered it." -- Glenn Greenwald

"Something to note from that graph: There were lots of very odd layer 7 ddos requests which affected tor performance moreso than anything ... like my TCP buffers weren't even close to max, but I had to mess with the ContrainedSockets options in torrc in order to have availability. ... Intangir and I even talked at the time about how it was probably a deanonymization attempt."
