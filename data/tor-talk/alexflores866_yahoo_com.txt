Sent from my iPhone  Hi, all!
There's a new Tor release candidate! Because it's not an official
release,, you should only run it if you're ready to find more bugs
than usual, and report them on trac.torproject.org.
The source code is available from the usual place on
 if you build Tor from source, why not give it a
try? And if you don't build Tor from source, packages should be ready
over the coming days, with a Tor Browser alpha release likely in the
next couple of weeks.
Here's what's new:
Changes in version 0.3.4.7-rc - 2018-08-24
  Tor 0.3.4.7-rc fixes several small compilation, portability, and
  correctness issues in previous versions of Tor. This version is a
  release candidate: if no serious bugs are found, we expect that the
  stable 0.3.4 release will be (almost) the same as this release.
  o Minor features (bug workaround):
    - Compile correctly on systems that provide the C11 stdatomic.h
      header, but where C11 atomic functions don't actually compile.
      Closes ticket 26779; workaround for Debian issue 903709.
  o Minor features (continuous integration):
    - Backport Travis rust distcheck to 0.3.3. Closes ticket 24629.
    - Enable macOS builds in our Travis CI configuration. Closes
      ticket 24629.
    - Install libcap-dev and libseccomp2-dev so these optional
      dependencies get tested on Travis CI. Closes ticket 26560.
    - Only post Appveyor IRC notifications when the build fails.
      Implements ticket 27275.
    - Run asciidoc during Travis CI. Implements ticket 27087.
    - Use ccache in our Travis CI configuration. Closes ticket 26952.
  o Minor features (continuous integration, rust):
    - Use cargo cache in our Travis CI configuration. Closes
      ticket 26952.
  o Minor features (directory authorities):
    - Authorities no longer vote to make the subprotocol version
      "LinkAuth=1" a requirement: it is unsupportable with NSS, and
      hasn't been needed since Tor 0.3.0.1-alpha. Closes ticket 27286.
  o Minor features (geoip):
    - Update geoip and geoip6 to the August 7 2018 Maxmind GeoLite2
      Country database. Closes ticket 27089.
  o Minor bugfixes (compilation, windows):
    - Don't link or search for pthreads when building for Windows, even
      if we are using build environment (like mingw) that provides a
      pthreads library. Fixes bug 27081; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
  o Minor bugfixes (continuous integration):
    - Improve Appveyor CI IRC logging. Generate correct branches and
      URLs for pull requests and tags. Use unambiguous short commits.
      Fixes bug 26979; bugfix on master.
    - Build with zstd on macOS. Fixes bug 27090; bugfix on 0.3.1.5-alpha.
    - Pass the module flags to distcheck configure, and log the flags
      before running configure. (Backported to 0.2.9 and later as a
      precaution.) Fixes bug 27088; bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (in-process restart):
    - Always call tor_free_all() when leaving tor_run_main(). When we
      did not, restarting tor in-process would cause an assertion
      failure. Fixes bug 26948; bugfix on 0.3.3.1-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (linux seccomp2 sandbox):
    - Fix a bug in out sandboxing rules for the openat() syscall.
      Previously, no openat() call would be permitted, which would break
      filesystem operations on recent glibc versions. Fixes bug 25440;
      bugfix on 0.2.9.15. Diagnosis and patch from Daniel Pinto.
  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - Fix bug that causes services to not ever rotate their descriptors
      if they were getting SIGHUPed often. Fixes bug 26932; bugfix
      on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (portability):
    - Fix compilation of the unit tests on GNU/Hurd, which does not
      define PATH_MAX. Fixes bug 26873; bugfix on 0.3.3.1-alpha. Patch
      from "paulusASol".
  o Minor bugfixes (rust):
    - Backport test_rust.sh from master. Fixes bug 26497; bugfix
      on 0.3.1.5-alpha.
    - Consistently use ../../.. as a fallback for $abs_top_srcdir in
      test_rust.sh. Fixes bug 27093; bugfix on 0.3.4.3-alpha.
    - Protover parsing was accepting the presence of whitespace in
      version strings, which the C implementation would choke on, e.g.
      "Desc=1\t,2". Fixes bug 27177; bugfix on 0.3.3.5-rc.
    - Protover parsing was ignoring a 2nd hyphen and everything after
      it, accepting entries like "Link=1-5-foo". Fixes bug 27164; bugfix
      on 0.3.3.1-alpha.
    - Stop setting $CARGO_HOME. cargo will use the user's $CARGO_HOME, or
      $HOME/.cargo by default. Fixes bug 26497; bugfix on 0.3.1.5-alpha.
    - cd to ${abs_top_builddir}/src/rust before running cargo in
      src/test/test_rust.sh. This makes the working directory consistent
      between builds and tests. Fixes bug 26497; bugfix on 0.3.3.2-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (testing, bootstrap):
    - When calculating bootstrap progress, check exit policies and the
      exit flag. Previously, Tor would only check the exit flag, which
      caused race conditions in small and fast networks like chutney.
      Fixes bug 27236; bugfix on 0.2.6.3-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (testing, openssl compatibility):
    - Our "tortls/cert_matches_key" unit test no longer relies on
      OpenSSL internals. Previously, it relied on unsupported OpenSSL
      behavior in a way that caused it to crash with OpenSSL 1.0.2p.
      Fixes bug 27226; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (Windows, compilation):
    - Silence a compilation warning on MSVC 2017 and clang-cl. Fixes bug
      27185; bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
