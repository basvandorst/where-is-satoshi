@_subject: best way to recover from bad circuit 
I've noticed more and more 404 No such Domain errors, and I was
wondering if there's a best way to resolve these. I've found that if I
leave Tor long enough, it'll set up a new circuit, and (usually)
that'll fix it. Alternatively, I can stop and restart Tor, and that
will fix it immediately. I worry, though, that restarting it
introduces some kind of overhead or load on the network that should be
avoided. Is there a better way to get it to establish a new circuit,
or a better way to resolve this problem? I'm on Mac OS X if it
matters. Thanks,

(moving back to or-talk)
While it's true the number of potential eavesdroppers across all  connections increases that much, the number of potential  eavesdroppers for any one connection or at any single time would seem  to increase only a little. That is, without Tor you have your ISP and  whatever computers are between it and your destination, and with Tor  you have the exit node operator, his ISP, and whatever computers are  between it and your destination. Whether the exit node operator is  likely to eavesdrop is, I think, speculation.

I recently noticed some odd error messages in my system log[1], and  some web searching seemed to indicate it was likely related to  running ppc-only code on my Intel-based Mac. It appears the binary of  Privoxy that is bundled with the non-Vidalia Tor v0.1.2.4-alpha is  ppc-only[2]. Since I hadn't noticed the errors before, I am assuming  this is different from Tor v0.1.2.3-alpha. I could be wrong, but I  couldn't find an easy way to check the binaries without installing  each one. Is this, in fact, new? If not, is there a reason we cannot  build universal copies of Privoxy?

@_subject: Tor DNS lookups failing 
I'm happy to report that after a couple of weeks of scanning, I found  no Tor servers that returned incorrect DNS information. However,  whenever I get a DNS lookup failure, SOAT reports the last exit node  as 0. Mike, does this mean it was unable to establish a circuit?

@_subject: Tor DNS lookups failing 
A few months ago I modified Snakes on a Tor to do DNS lookups through  various nodes and compare the results. At the time there was a node  that was intermittently giving users an ad page instead of a real  page. I found then that the only node that was returning an IP  address that was incorrect was "whistlersmother," but I didn't report  that here because I was a little unsure about my methodology.
Last week I started scanning again with a better idea of what I was  doing. Notably, the latest Tor alpha resets the DNS cache on NEWNYM,  so I didn't have to much with the Tor source to stop it from caching  the lookups. After a couple of days of scanning, I haven't found any  nodes returning incorrect information, but I have seen more lookup  failures than I remember seeing last time. This jibes with my  personal experience, where I feel like I've seen more DNS lookup  failures than previously.
I was wondering, first, if other people are seeing fairly frequent  erroneous DNS failures. Secondly, is there anything Tor can do to  improve the situation, like requesting a second lookup via another  circuit if one reports a failure, or maybe not caching failures? I'm  not sure either of those is a good solution, but right now when I get  a failure I have to either wait for the circuit to time out or send  Tor NEWNYM. Otherwise the result seems to be cached, so a reload in  my web browser just gives me the Privoxy error page again.

@_subject: Switching Tor on and off on Mac OS X Tiger 
Depending on what you're asking there are really two ways to control  Tor when you're using Safari.
If you're talking about turning Tor on and off completely, the  easiest way is to go to the "Network" System Preference panel and  uncheck the proxy settings. As someone else suggested, you could also  create separate network locations, one with proxies and one without,  though switching locations would interrupt connections.
Something else you can try is adding hosts you want fast access to to  the proxy exceptions list in the Network panel. Access to these will  be fast, but not anonymous.
For both situations, you can also edit your Privoxy config file (/ Library/Privoxy/config). You can comment out the "forward-socks4a /  localhost:9050 ." line to turn off Tor completely, or you can add  lines below that to keep certain hosts from going through Tor. For  example, I have the following lines in my config:
forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
forward   192.168.1.1 .
forward   160.79.128.22 . # Digitally Imported streaming music
forward   swcdn.apple.com . # Apple system updates downloads
forward   kh.google.com   . # Google Earth
forward   mail.google.com:443   . # Gmail

I'm still a little fuzzy on these details, but my web browser has  been crashing a lot recently, and I've been having a heck of a time  tracking down the reason. It now appears that some (but not all)  HTTPS sites, loaded with Tor as a SOCKS proxy, cause WebKit-based  browsers (Safari, OmniWeb) to crash. The same sites loaded with no  proxy or with Privoxy as an HTTPS proxy load fine.
I'm running Tor 0.1.2.3-alpha, so I'm going to try to test this with  0.1.2.2 to see if it makes a difference. Whatever the case, the  browser shouldn't be crashing, even if Tor is sending it bad data. Is  there any way I can monitor the data being sent between Tor and the  browser, though, or is there a way to find out if there is a problem  with the way Tor is acting as a SOCKS proxy?

I seem to remember someone recently  saying that a lot of the slowdown is from slow encryption/decryption  processing on server nodes, be they exit or middlemen.
If the problem is not bandwidth, would more servers help, or do we  need faster servers (as in CPU speed)?

Hey Mike!
I'm not completely sure how to read this, but it's cleaner than the
debug log. I see various "failed" messages, like the following:
650 ORCONN kgabertgoldmine2 FAILED REASON=DONE NCIRCS=2
650 CIRC 1721 FAILED REASON=OR_CONN_CLOSED
650 CIRC 1722 FAILED REASON=TIMEOUT
It appears all the CIRC ... FAILED messages are due to OR_CONN_CLOSED
or TIMEOUT.
Oddly, Wireshark examination of tcpdump shows communications in both
directions, so it appears the firewall isn't blocking connections
Even more oddly, I set my home SSH server to listen on port 443, and
that works fine. That same machine is running as a tor server, so
either the firewall is blocking tor servers only on tor ports (but
then why can I see connections in the dump?) or they're not blocking
tor and something else is wrong.
I don't think so. I can telnet to BostonUCompSci (128.197.11.30) port
80 and send "GET /", and I get back what looks like Tor stuff. This is
another reason I suspect that it's a Tor issue rather than the
firewall blocking outright.
