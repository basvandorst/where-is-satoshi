I don't know which ones are the relevant exit nodes now, I am just
throwing this in, in no particular order, just picking whatever sounds
Chrysanthos (or chrysanthemon) means golden flower in Greek, it is also a
Kyriakos means "the Lord's" or "of the Lord", also a name
Menelaos is from Greek mythology (Trojan war)
Lycos - various figures in Greek mythology
Lucrece is a Roman figure Ovid wrote about, Shakespeare picked it up in
The Rape Of Lucrece
Maximianus a Roman Emperor
Ottmar is a male German first name
Gennadius is a moth
Obana/Callopistria is a moth
Dagda seems to be Irish mythology, says wikipedia
Byxus: byxus.dll was some Windows malware, says the search engine.
Some of the node names look like permutation cyphers:
Ismche - chimes
Ardenem - amender
But this is really just a lucky guess.
