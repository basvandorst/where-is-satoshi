For exit router selection path-spec says that;
"For circuits that do not need to be "fast", when choosing among multiple
candidates for a path element, we choose randomly. For "fast" circuits, we
pick a given router as an exit with probability proportional to its
Could anybody explain why Tor pick exit router with probability proportional
to its bandwidth *only for fast circuits*? As far as i know Tor uses this
technique for load-balance. But why it uses this technique only for fast
Thanks in advance.

Hello Everyone,
Firstly thank all of you so much for your concern. I really appreciate all
effort which for anonymity by open source.
Mike, I'm reading and trying to understand your changes on path and
dir-spec. Could you say please why there isn't "Wge" integer value on list?
Can't we select a node with exit flag for guard position?
Also could you please explain what is the condition of below statement on
path-spec? ;
"If we're using Guard nodes, the first node must be a Guard (see 5 below )"
It says see 5 below but even i've read 5. section i couldn't get what is the
condition of this statement; "if we're using Guard nodes".
Thanks in advance.

Nowadays I'm reading a part of dir-spec. I noticed below sentence;
"Directory servers administrators may label some servers or IPs as
blacklisted, and elect not to include them in their network-status lists."
Could anybody explain who are these directory servers administrators? And
what is their abilities on Tor network?
Thanks in advance.

Hello Mike,
Thank you for your concern.
guard position.
You said that "only" but, depends on your changes for dir-spec, it seems
that we can select dual flagged, non-flagged and guard-flagged nodes for the
guard position as below;
Wgg - Weight for Guard-flagged nodes in the guard position
Wgm - Weight for non-flagged nodes in the guard Position
Wgd - Weight for Guard+Exit-flagged nodes in the guard Position
Therefore i couldn't understand why there isn't Wge integer value on your
changes. I think it seems possible that we can select exit-flagged nodes in
guard position if guards are scarce. What do you think?
On the otherhand did you simulate your changes? If yes, could you share
results of the simulations?
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: Sending CREATE and CREATED cells 
I asked this question also on  but it's not answered yet.
I'm looking debug logs of my relays and i realized that
onionskin_answer() method is called so more than
circuit_deliver_create_cell(). For example when i look debug logs now,
one of them is called 2334 times and the other one 120 times. I
couldn't understand how it can be possible. Could you help me to
comment this situation?
As far as i understood onionskin_answer() method is using to send
"CREATED" cell to previous hop, and circuit_deliver_create_cell() is
using to send "CREATE" cell to next hop. So i think that their calling
times should be same. Could you say where is my mistake?
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: Request clarification @ Dir-spec 
In dir-spec there is "3.3 Deciding how to vote" section. But i think that
it's headline should be "An authority is deciding how to assign flags to
routers' status entries for preparing it's own vote document". What do you
I think that because this section doesn't contain anything about voting.
It's just assigning.

@_subject: Question about signing & verifying 
I've question about signing especially for signing router-descriptor;
Is the router "signing-key" using to prepare a router's signature with
digest algorithm? If so then does an OR sign it's router descriptor with
it's signature? Finally can we say right for below sequence?
"signing-key" ---- digest algorithm --- > "router-signature"
initial "router-descriptor" ----- sign with "router-signature" --- > signed
After that how a directory authority verify whether the router descriptor is

You can enable info and debug logs on Vidalia. When you open"Message Log"
option on Vidalia, click Settings and mark Info and Debug logs. After that
you can see all logs but be careful because when you enable the debug logs,
Vidalia can consume your Cpu highly.
Hope this helps.

Isn't there any way to detect automatically if these 28 relays in same
