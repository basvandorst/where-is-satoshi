xmpp, mailing lists) allow you to register and connect over onion services.
everything is free, although they recommend that you contribute towards

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why obfs4 bridges aren't work in Tails? 
i'm not sure if you mentioned this prior but obfs4 bridges must also
contain the "cert=xxxxxxxxxx" flag in the bridge lines or Tor won't connect
to the bridges

@_subject: [tor-talk] SIGAINT email service targeted by 70 bad exit nodes 
If it's any help, I remember seeing some sort of list on the tor-talk
mailing list regarding the names of the (now) BadExit relays: name such as
"samest" "engbeli" "enthory", imeld, darctur, lakin, orod, rengmarg. If
someone can pull up a search tool and find it in previous threads, it would
be a great help. I'm on a censored connection at the moment and cannot
perform any such tasks.
Good luck, sigaint!

@_subject: [tor-talk] What happened to Tor's Bridges? 
I'm having issues requesting bridges by email (from a gmail account).
"Hey, michaelballriseup!

i may be mistaken that it is kinda stupid not to use HTTPS on a
website with downloads, as documents released by Ed Snowden show that
the NSA has the capability of injecting malicious software into active
EXE file downloads in realtime.
by the way, i cannot access your website without a preluding " to
the domain. this needs to be fixed.

you might be able to use obfs4 bridges; they are new and may not be
censoured yet

@_subject: [tor-talk] Obfs4 for Tor 
in Ubuntu make sure you've installed obfs4:
sudo apt-get install obfs4proxy
in obfs4 for Tor you need to include the other parts of the bridge line as
  obfs4 [IP ADDRESS] [BRIDGE FINGERPRINT] cert=[certificate string]
so for example, you could use this line (it may become censored as this is
a public mailing list):
  obfs4 192.36.27.17:44853 43F1FDB442C714D2D53C643668E5FB3206352381
let the mailing list know if this doesn't work for you.

I don't think that it's currently possible; the nearest thing would be to
just stop announcing the key and securely wipe it from your files

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Tor project idea for internet comments 
This isn't technically feasible-- for example, censored users in countries
with slow Internet speeds (Iran, Cuba, Syria) would be unable to connect to
the network by being forced to relay connections if they install the
browser plugin. The Tor network relies on volunteers who have the ability
to quickly and safely relay traffic to do so, and users who do not have
those abilities are not at a disadvantage.
Tor developers, community members and volunteers could better spend the
time creating this system for something that yields more results, like
actually encouraging the websites who censor Tor users to not do so-- they
should rather use a CAPTCHA system or another form of human verification
(that does not break anonymity).
This isn't something new or exclusive to Tor users. Anyone who creates a
website with a comment system can censor and prune the comments they don't
agree with. I do agree, a separate comment system would be great at
fighting the censorship by websites, but it isn't something the Tor
developers should focus on.
Good idea, but not exactly the right place. Thanks for the idea, and
welcome to the Tor mailing list!

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is wrong with TOR, or with me?? 
your PDFs are missing due to the resend; can you attach them to another
email please?
otherwise, i assume the website you are trying to access has blocked access
from Tor exit relays. this is not an issue on your side
