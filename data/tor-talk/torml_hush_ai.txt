I guess you didn't read the hole thread on this list, especially this reply:

I guess check.torproject.org (btw: you should allways use the https version of it) just compairs your source IP with the list of exit-
nodes (what else should it be doing?).
And because your source IP matches with an exit-node:
it will always tell you, that you are using tor even if you don't.

I also thought about this, but this might result in 'false-
negatives' (the check tells you your are not using tor even if you do) in the following scenario:
- you are using tor and check.torproject.org is (hypothetically) running as exit enclave
- the check is (hypothetically) just matching against 127.0.0.1 (localhost = tor user, other = non-tor user)
- it might be the case that you are reaching check.t.o over the tor network and the check tells you, that you are not using tor, because you used another exit node instead of check.t.o itself
According to [1] this is case if your client has not yet fetched the node descriptor of check.t.o and is therefore using another exit node instead of using check.t.o
[1] The other question would be:
Is it a problem that check.t.o tells you that you are using tor even if you don't? (in the case that your source IP address is also used by an exit node)
If you follow the 'official' recommendations to not mix your traffic with that of an exit node (even if this is very attracting) [2] this 'problem' will never arise.
[2] There might be scenarios where you are behind a NAT device and you do not even know that someone else is running a tor exit using the same official IP address.
