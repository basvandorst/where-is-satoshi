In-Reply-To- or References-headers, thus continually breaking threads
for everyone else, complained:
Remove the beam from your own eye before trying to remove the splinter

As usual you're completely missing the point. Nobody's demanding the use
of threaded MUAs, but a lot of people do use them, and threading is
convenient even for low low-volume lists. Your persistent refusal to use
a reasonable mail setup, which in turn leads to broken threads, makes
things unnecessarily hard for everyone else for no apparent reason other
than your reluctance to fix your mail setup.
Beam and splinter. Stop making things hard for others yourself, then you
can come again and complain.

@_subject: [OT]  mail interfaces 
Other people manage to get working mail setups one way or another.
Apparently you're the only person in the world who can't.
But of course it is a matter of your very own laziness. If you wanted,
you could most easily find other (more compliant) ways to read/send
mail. Of course that would require yourself to do something instead of
someone else. Which obviously is the problem at hand.
And while we're already at it: I do read this list, so there's no need
for you to send me additional copies of your mails. The list address by
all means does suffice.
Maybe you should try realizing that some people read more than just this
The second you stop worrying about attributions when your own mails are
still *way* sub-par.
BTW, did I mention that with proper threading in place, lack of
attribution magically ceases to be a problem?

@_subject: [OT] message formats (was: browser footprint) 
As per RFC 2045 base64 is a valid transfer encoding for a message body.
It was declared correctly in the header, too. What kind of MUA do you
use that won't decode this for you?
Besides, before complaining about other people's messages, I'd suggest
you start with fixing your own. Like, by not omitting References and
In-Reply-To headers.

Look, the mail you complained about was perfectly standard-compliant. If
you choose to use an outdated MUA on an outdated and/or misconfigured
system that's your problem, not anyone else's. Quit whining and move on.

No, port 587/tcp is not used for "secure e-mail" (whatever that's
supposed to be), but for e-mail submission. It's an attempt to separate
mail relaying between SMTP servers from initial submission from the
user's mail client to an SMTP server. Just as with SMTP, security is
optional. See RFC 4409 for details on the protocol.

Upgrade your operating system. The extended support period for Windows
98 SE expired in July 2006. The operating system will no longer receive
bugfixes, and should thus no longer be connected to public networks.

Look, it's actually really simple. RFC 1855 summarizes what is commonly
referred to as "the netiquette". Either you're referring to the
netiquette, then you're automatically implicitly referring to RFC 1855,
or you're not referring to the netiquette in the first place. Your
reluctance to accept the fact doesn't change anything about it.
Not holding my breath.

RFC 1855 === standard netiquette
Like it or not.
Or perhaps the issue is that the netiquette just doesn't state what you
said it would.

RFC 1855 does not say any such thing, and it's usually frowned upon on
virtually every mailing list that I frequent. YMMV.
