@_subject: [tor-talk] Learn to contribute to Vidalia, 
Hello lovely Tor fans,
chiiph (the Vidalia maintainer) is running a session to teach people how to compile Vidalia, the main Tor user interface.
If you've been waiting for a chance to get involved with moving the Tor project forward, this is a really good event to go to. Vidalia is probably the most user-visible part of Tor's privacy offering.
New people are very welcome to attend. If you're just generally curious about what it's like to build a reasonably big open source project, do show up! Vidalia runs on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux (and other UNIXy platforms), so whatever OS you're running is probably okay.
Vidalia is written in C++.
WHAT: "Build it" event for Vidalia
        The point of the event is to teach people how
        to compile Vidalia for their own systems, with an eye toward
        creating new contributors to the project.
WHEN: The event is very soon -- 9 AM US/Eastern.
       Friday, April 15, 2011
       Convert to local time at:
                  or with:
         $ date -d 'Fri Apr 15 13:00 UTC'
         Fri Apr 15 09:00:00 EDT 2011
WHERE: irc.oftc.net                 (if you do not have an IRC chat client)
If you want to attend and but the timing is bad, I hope you'll sign on to  anyway. It's on irc.oftc.net.
Again,  has more I realize I'm sending this out rather close to the actual event, but I figure, better late than never.
Yours truly,

Hi Robert,
As the author of that asheesh.org note, I suggest you read it carefully.
In particular, pay attention to how key timestamps are used in OpenPGP!
It's interesting and was surprising to me at first, too.

@_subject: [tor-talk] misconfigured mailing list (mailman software) for 
Excerpts from Roger Dingledine's message of Fri Nov 09 18:41:06 -0500 2012:
What I've done for this is to simply remove the password fields from the form. Then it autoassigns you a password.
You can see that here: (Viewing the source, I see what I did instead was to put it in an HTML I brought that trick with me to other domains, e.g. Contrast with e.g.  where the password form is visible.
It's fairly simple edit to the default mailman template, as I recall, and these changes I made have successfully stuck around across upgrades and more.
Users will still need to use the list password to do things like change one's email address on the list and a few other obscure things. My hack is just a UI fix that papers over the deep insanity of Mailman passwords, and I rank it quite high for cost-effectiveness. So please consider it! I hope it fits y'all's needs.
