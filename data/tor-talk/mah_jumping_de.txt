... Roger cheered a lot about Facebook offering a hidden service.
To be honest, this surprises me quite a bit. Tor is for anonymisation,
so one can escape tax paid surveillance by NSA, GCHQ & Co., which is
useful. And then such a Tor user connects to Facebook, where one has to
log in, making this anonymisation completely pointless? At least I don't
get the point.
Even assuming that Facebook doesn't regularly exchange user data with
NSA, this makes mass surveillance trivial. Useful, welcome, or not,
Facebook does mass surveillance on its own, as stated business practice.
Also, I'm pretty sure if another Manning-like case appears, NSA would
immediately command Facebook to offer the related user identification.
If there's cheering about Facebook hidden services, shouldn't always a
note be added that logging in there identifies a user, making Tor
(almost) pointless?

Didn't mean to question that, you're right, of course. Still I think
such obstacles like deanonymisation should be at least mentioned instead
of praising this service as if it was the state of the art regarding
countering surveillance. If this continues, the word about Tor could be
quickly along the lines of "Tor is pointless, they recommend to
communicate via Facebook".

If the above is welcome and even advertised for, torproject.org's
headline should likely change. Citing the current headline from
Making users into assuming that they're anonymous just by using Tor
while they still have to care about anonymity them selfs is certainly
more dangerous than having no Tor at all.
How about:
Much closer to reality. Might also help to get these rumours about a
'dark web' settled.

I see. You're after maximising Tor usage, me is after minimising
surveillance, which isn't the same. Confusion solved.

A few points come to mind:
- AFAIK it's true, the more boxes there are, the safer the network is.
- Typical ISP plans have ridiculously low upstream rates, at least here
in Germany. For example a popular DSL contract is 16 Mbit downstream,
but only 1 Mbit upstream. To operate a relay or gateway the lower of
both numbers matters, so one can offer only one Mbit.
- The Tor network carries data about all network connected relays and
gateways around, so the more boxes there are, the bigger this chunk
gets. At some point such boxes (their upload bandwidth) are exhausted
with just this maintenance stuff. Not sure where this point is, also
found no related investigations.
- Why do you see a need for dedicated hardware? An off the shelf router
running OpenWRT works just fine. Install the tor package, edit torrc and
it works. I run such a thing (TP-Link WDR3600) and have no reason to
think hardware couldn't keep up with the required computing. Caveat: I'm
not aware of a tool to test computing demands either, I just see free
RAM, free 'disk' and only 5% load.
- One thing is indeed missing: up to date Tor packages for OpenWRT.
Their current stable release comes with Tor 0.2.5.12, several versions
behind what the Tor project offers.
In case you want to have a look (my plan is 20/1 Mbit cable):
Did an upgrade on Jan 4th and forgot to backup the keys, so data
currently goes only 2 weeks back. Graphs weren't much better with the
previous keys, over a whole year only 2 or 3 days actually forwarding
some TCP packages.

If one manages to install OpenWRT, installing Tor is just a matter of a
few clicks. If you think this is a problem, you can build images with
this package already included, no need for custom hardware.
And be careful with configuring as an exit node by default: quite some
services and web pages, e.g. freenode IRC, disallow a connection if it
comes from an exit node, even if the connection is made without Tor.
I brought this up about a year ago and people here found not much wrong
with such behaviour, so it's unlikely it'll be addressed. Still it's
very confusing for the non-experts, of course.
