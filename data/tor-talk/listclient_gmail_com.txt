I hope I am in right place :-)
I am having problems connecting to any news server using thunderbird
with tor and privoxy. Connection times out everytime.
tor v 0.1.0.2 (on localhost 9050)
privoxy v3.0.3 (on localhost 8118)
thunderbird v 1.0 (set to localhost 8118)
all other applications are 'torifed?' with no problem

Many thanks for all replies and your time. Maybe the problem is with the Privoxy and not with the Tor, because
when I connect Thunderbird to Tor directly (localhost 9050) I have no
problem connecting to the news servers, although I get the usual
possible information leak warning from Tor.
In addition when privoxy is running and browser requests a page, the
request is shown in Privoxy window with but with
Thunderbird-Privoxy-Tor no request from Thunderbird is appearing in
Privoxy window so this makes me think there is a problem between

I would love to do that but I want to use the system as a user for a
while to get use to it and I am not sure if my current connection
(512/128) would support the quality that may be expected from a Tor
Indeed it has and many thanks to developers who are doing a great job.

@_subject: Warnings on the download page 
Assuming add-ons work as intended. For example (just an example, nothing against flashblock):
Firefox 2.0.0.2 (Fresh install).
Install Flashblock
Visit Youtube (or any other page with flash)
Flashblock seems to be working but...
Disable Javascript from options menu
Revisit Youtube and flash video displays.
So...I need Javascript to block Flash?
Then there is the overlapping in functionality. Flashblock blocks flash, so as NoScript. Noscript blocks JS, so as developers toolbar, so as options menu item etc etc.
Then how does one block all plug-ins? visit  if you really want to be confused. Then there are cookies, refererers, Java. A dozen add-ons, tens of settings. One needs a PhD in browser setup.
What is needed is an add-on for Tor written by somebody who understands innards of and attacks against Tor. Start Tor, activate add-on, ready to go.
