Thanks for the reply and info.
Unfortunately it does not clear the matter up, as these "fictional"  and "EGOTISTICALGIRAFFE" perspectives were known and considered here  But maybe we can clear this matter up right now with a few quick and  honest questions..
Are you coderman the Martin R. Peck of the mentioned affidavit and  BigSun application?
- - Did you personally dream up and write this EGOTISTICALSHALLOT codename  and quoted text about a TAO exploit specific to Whonix Qubes? Are you  the original author of this or was it copied from another source?
"EGOTISTICALSHALLOT was created in 2014 by Tailored Access Operations  as a QUANTUMTHEORY Computer Network Exploitation component effective  against hardened Whoonix Qubes users on the Tor Network."
If you are indeed the original author, what personally compelled you  towards specifically choosing Whonix Qubes as a TAO exploit example  and highlighting Whonix Qubes as a prime example in your NLP system  offering to the NSA?
If you are not the original author, what is the original source  reference where this quoted text was copied from?
"EGOTISTICALSHALLOT was created in 2014 by Tailored Access Operations  as a QUANTUMTHEORY Computer Network Exploitation component effective  against hardened Whoonix Qubes users on the Tor Network."
Given the alarming nature of where the text showed up (US Court), who  it was being offered to (NSA), and what this "fictional" text  specifically made a claim of (TAO exploit of Whonix Qubes), we are  just wanting to be 100% clear on understanding and cleaning this  matter up.
