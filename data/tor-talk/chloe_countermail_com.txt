@_subject: [tor-talk] Question regarding some strange behavior on some 
I have a question regarding some strange behavior on some nodes(11 of See this access-log:
81.89.0.201 - - [25/Jun/2015 12:25:30] "GET /db/backups/965110218-2015 HTTP/1.1" 200 5057
37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:00:10] "GET /db/backups/965110218-2015 HTTP/1.1" 200 5057
37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:00:35] "GET 37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:00:40] "GET 37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:00:46] "GET 37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:00:51] "GET 37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:00:57] "GET 37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:01:02] "GET 37.187.202.46 - - [25/Jun/2015 14:01:08] "GET AE4E83B0BFDF679989D746C3B3DEF2EBCA35FA68 was using URL 965110218-2015
Here we can see that node (AE4E83B0BFDF679989D746C3B3DEF2EBCA35FA68) with IP 81.89.0.201 first visit the unique URL "/db/backups/965110218-2015"  and then around 1.5 hours later another IP visits the same URL and does some indexing?
The other 10 nodes are doing the exact same thing. I'm using Bottlepy as "web server" so no User Agent grabbed, but still, this is a unique URL, why do I have more than 2 visits on them? The IP 37.187.202.46 is not part of Tor.
Could you please look into this problem? The affected exitnodes are:
Kind regards,

This is just part of my research and I was informed to bounce my results over to you so you can look deeper in why the exits are doing what they do.
All URLs are unique, so the chance for a crawler/spider/robot to find that URL is extremely unlikely.
generated, saved to a list and checked if there's any duplicates, if so, remove them. Then, all these URLs are visited through all (public) exitnodes. A web server is used and saves all(HTTP) the requests to a file(log). Later I check that log if an URL has been visited more than one time, if so I know that something fishy[sic] is going on with that nusenu skrev den 6/27/2015 19:19:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-users per capita in Tor metrics 
I thought it would be a great idea to have data on how many Tor-users
each country has per capitaa as it would show a more accurate number on
how active a country uses Tor.
How can I reach out to the Tor Metrics devs to get this data implemented?
