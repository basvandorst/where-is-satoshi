their inactive tor clients (i.e. sudo /etc/init.d/tor stop ) to take the
pressure off the exits and middles. When I read the above thread I

@_subject: Javascript security question 
It's not safe.. The problem isn't the sites you are visiting.. The
problem is that an Evil exit node can inject javascript into any
(non https) page you are viewing. yahoo mail falls into this category,
as could google reader and blogger.com (you can force google reader to
https but it is easy to forget). The clever use of javascript can pose
many security risks other then simply unmasking your IP address. I
would STRONGLY advise against using TOR with javascript enabled.
(unless you explicitly trust (own/administer) the exit node.. but this
presents problems of it's own ;)  ).

@_subject: Javascript security question 
Using a properly Locked down browser (Torbutton/etc), and staying as
much as possible to encrypted connections (https) It is possible to use
Tor "fairly" safely. Remember, using the open Internet is largely an
exercise in trust. you trust that none of the system between you and
yahoo will eavesdrop and you trust that none of them will inject
anything. Both of these are Basically huge assumptions anytime you are
not using SSL or some other secure end-to-end encryption. ISPs do
inject (Rogers here in Canada played with it). ISPs do eavesdrop
(phorm/BT). So I try to use https/etc as much as I can anyways.
Considering the above (and I'm sure others will add a few points). you
need to get as informed as possible on both TOR and the open net and
then make an informed risk assessment. Are the risks greater then the
open net? Is the anonymity worth the risk? Can I do it all over SSL?

You're not alone. I use a seperate browser for Tor and it is completely
stripped out no plugins, java/javascript disables, defaults to saving

"popular" sites are unfriendly to such a browser if not down right
hostile. The old ideal of "fail gracefully" seems lost on modern web
designers. It seems little attention is paid to the fact that not
everyone has a super fast machine, flash 10, ie7, ff3.x, etc., Of
course the other side of the problem is that few people try to hold
such sites to account. IMHO All sites should work (display something
useful even if not as functional as the "full" site) with browsers as
basic as Lynx.

i had this same problem once ages ago.. To fix it I had to un-install
tor button. go into preferences and set the networking to have nothing
in the proxy settings. (not just hitting the "direct connection" but
actually blanking all the fields first) save those settings. re-install
tor button.
Hope this helps,
Seemed to me atthe time what was happening is that TorButton seemed to
store how you proxy settings were set when it was installed.. changing
them after that wasn't picked up.. the only way to get to stored Tor
with Torbutton off settings out was to uninstall tor button so it would
pick up the blank settings on the re-install.

Interesting paper thanks for posting the link to it. I've given it a
quick once over and from what I can see all variations of this attack
require scripting of one sort or another. Since the recommended way to
run a Browser on Tor is with ALL scripting disabled, this shouldn't
effect people that are configured correctly. Of greater concern for me
is if NoScript which I use for my non Tor browsing would catch this or
not. Does anyone know if NoScript relies on the browser for the context
of a frame or does it check the origin it self?

I believe that this is a common misconception using Tor in this manner
will not hide you from someone scraping the tracker. It will hide you
from your ISPs DPI throttling (watching for/blocking connections going
to trackers) but what gets reported to the tracker is your actual IP
as without that the other peers would be unable to connect to you. So
you can use this to get around throttling or blocking but it does not
hide you from anti-p2p companies. If people want anonymous transfers they should use/support gnunet,
mute or the like. Bittorrent was never built to be annonymous.

Many other clients do not let you sent the IP that get reported
Transmission for example has the option to connect to the tracker
through a proxy but no way to set what IP gets reported.
The way I read this it will be the IP that was reported to the Tracker
that is included unless none was reported. So if your client is
reporting an your IP address (optimal for transfers/ not optimal for
privacy) Peerid is used once the connection is established as we can see from
the first paragraph in this section:
"Any remote peer wishing to communicate with the local peer must open a
TCP connection to this port and perform a handshake operation. The
handshake operation MUST be carried out before any other data is sent
from the remote peer"
if the wrong IP address is specified (and defaulting to the exit node
ip by having the client not report one results in a incorrect IP)
People wont be able to connect to you at all (you'll be able to
download but wont share much back)
So from what I see unless you stop you client from sending the IP or
the client doesn't send it. then your proper IP will be reported to the
tracker. If your client doesn't send your IP and you use tor You will
end up in a state that makes your client a total leech?

Or, perhaps they have lives. I just wanted to point out that you could
always get a nice old beige box from someone put a small Linux distro
on it and route you 98SE machines through Tor on that box. That way, you
keep 98se. you keep Tor. Also, having the Linux box as your proxy would
also let you unload both tor and privoxy from you 98se boxen. You could
even configure iptables to help ensure there are no data leaks from
misbehaving win98se appies.
Just a though.

@_subject: Obfuscated URLs? 
It should. But hidden services provide this functionality already. I do
understand the potential difficulties in setting up a hidden service.
But I think it would be easier to automate this aspect of Tor then to
write a new protocol. (some more thoughts on this below)
Agreed.. I'm a security minded IT guy and since drive-by-downloads are
the top vector for computer infection any time I hear "obvascated URL"
and "Untraceable" in the same paragraph the is a knee jerk reaction to
see the security implications.
OK I now have a clearer idea of what you are wanting to do:
1). Simple anonymous publishing
2). Remove the single point of failure that a a hidden service may
3). Plausable deniability by not having the information hosting tied
to you.
I think that this could be solved in a couple of different ways.
1). Someone sets up a hidden service that automatically re-directs to
the content hosted on non-Hidden sites the URL would probably end up
looking like:
 password
one could argue that there is still a single point of failure but if
it was popular enough I'm sure it could be hidden mirrored.
2.) GnuNet may be much better suited to what you are looking to do. It
already has a lot of these features (see  ) Once you
inserted the information into GnuNet you could share the hash for it in
as many open sites as you wanted. As for making the content password
protected GnuPG would work wonders for this (prior to insertion of
course)

I second this thought and have used Tor for many of the same things.
Tor is immensely helpful when I was dealing with an ISP that had
consistent DNS server problems. It is great for checking if my small
web server is up (my current ISP blocks connections to oneself). I think
that it would be an excellent Idea to have some of these uses of Tor
promoted on the website.

@_author: Freemor 
@_subject: Obfuscated URLs? 
An interesting idea. I see two possible problems with it. Firstly
I'm not sure storing the route is useful. Due to the nature of Tor
some relays may not be up all the time so having them hard coded in
the URL could be a path to failure. Also I am not sure there would
be any security advantage (other then possibly specifying the exit
node to keep it in a friendly jurisdiction or something .. but this
too has it's potential problems (see next point).
Secondly this idea seems more suited to malicious uses (obviscated URL
to exploit site/etc) then to the more dissident need for anonymity.
(I could be wrong. I welcome some examples to get me thinking in the right
lines.). One of the reasons I say this is that if the information is
not running on a hidden server then it will most likely be found and
shutdown. Since anyone that could use these URLs would need to have
TOR installed and running I'm having a hard time seeing the
advantage to this over a .onion URL. (Again I welcome examples)
Just my thoughts

@_subject: Tor a carrier for Botnet traffic? 
You bring up a good point Scott about the Tor website referring to Tor
as a server. The truth is that it is much closer to a router or proxy.
The problem as I see it however is that ISPs that have AUP against
servers usually include proxies as a no-no.. in fact I've seen some so
broad as to claim that using ping or trace-route are "hostile" and
grounds for disconnection.
So I agree that the wording on the Tor site probably should be changed.
I however doubt it will do much to convince errant ISPs. from what I
have seen the thing that sets off hostile attitudes by some ISPs (I'm
in Canada mind) is too much outbound traffic. This is especially true
for ISPs that consistently oversell their bandwidth. (a la Rogers).

I'm on the same page here until I see a properly documented case of Tor
being used as a CnC channel or in some other way by a bot net I'm
going to chalk it up to FUD. To the OP the open Internet carries FAR more botnet traffic.. perhaps
we should block the entire net? If you want to stop botnets.. educate
people. Teach them how  not to get infected. Teach them how to tell if
they are infected. Teach then to use firewalls that are not outbound
leaky and are on an independent machine used just as a FW with no
remote admin. Proper security practises would do far more to stop
Botnets then worrying about Tor.
