So far as I know, some Chinese connect to outside by renting his own VPN
connection. I think you can do this.

In fact, some authorities do view the traffic. For example, China is viewing the traffic coming in and
out of the border, and blocking the connections when "sensitive" content occurs. So far as I know,
as there are so many people viewing the "sensitive" contents through kinds of proxies like Tor, and
the authority is too "busy" to stop all the links and arrest the viewer only if it's not that important. I
think you can read the paper of "Ignoring the great firewall of China" for technology details.
And Yahoo! did betray its users once and caused the arrest of a Chinese journalist named Shi Tao.
I don't know if the other companies have ever betrayed their users.

@_subject: Questions about the connection 
Hi, all
I run a relay in a LAN with a public IP address. However, for only a few
times, my server can be reached from outside, though the connection speed is
really fast. I tried to ping some of the relays which responded within 1
second. Can anyone tell me why this would happen and any solutions?
