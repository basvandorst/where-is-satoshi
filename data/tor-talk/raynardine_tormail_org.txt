Hash: SHA1
Hello, I am a math student in college. I'm interested in tor and
cryptography in general.
I just thought I'd say hello.
Is anyone else here a mathematics major in university?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are connections to two different hidden services 
Both x.onion and y.onion will build circuits through the same SocksPort
on localhost (TransPort if your application does not natively support
However, generally speaking, different circuits will be built to each
hidden service.

I think that dummy traffic on sustained circuits to one's entry guards
is a good idea.
You could make it an optional feature in torrc.
I would also suggest garlic routing as an optional feature, by this I
mean introducing very small delays in order to transmit bundles of
transmissions together in order to make traffic analysis and correlation
significantly more expensive and tedious for the adversary.

I did not realize that Bitcoin was capable of accepting incoming
connections via Tor.
This should be a standard feature of the mainline Bitcoin client.

I'd suggest hosting a hidden service and encouraging your local-language
friends to post there, and to use a formal stiffer style to thwart
writing-style pattern-matching.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Attracting more community input on Tor issues 
I think better engagement with the Tor community would be easier with a
StatusNet instance run as a hidden service.
I also think that a mailing list mirror or relay run as a Tor hidden
service might encourage more Tor users to subscribe.
I would not mind paying for and helping to administer such services.

I do not like connecting to clearnet services from Tor.
I am not alone in this.
There are arguments about the reasons why Tor hidden services can be
better than clearnet services for users as well, but that would derail
this thread.

My understanding is that the mainline Bitcoint-QT reference client
implementation does not come with Tor bundled and pre-configured to make
use of Tor location-hidden services in order to accept incoming
connections, but it seems I was not the only one thinking in that direction.
The latest stable release for Bitcoin-QT has port 9050 suggested as
SOCKS port, which implies that Tor is suggested as a possible
anonymization measure to be taken by the casual user, but it does not
come pre-packaged with Tor bundled with it.
I am pleased to see that Bitcoin does have features that make it a lot
easier to accept incoming connections by way of location-hidden
services, and I think that is beneficial for both Tor and Bitcoin user
Tor and Bitcoin go together so well.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden vs Clearnet Services 
I will need to compile all of the various arguments, but the biggest
reason is that clearnet sites are not anonymous, so they have no
incentive to maintain your anonymity.
In fact, most clearnet sites, because they are legally liable for
everything their users do, they have a strong incentive to use any
weakness in Javascript, Java, Flash, whatever they can use, to
deanonymize you.
Beside that cold hard fact, and the corollary to that, that even if a
supposedly saintly core developer or web site administrator swears up
and down that they'd never divulge the keys and surrender the
responsibility of their users to any men with guns, court decision, or
whatever, the problem lies in that they are a target.
Any non-anonymous website is a painted bull's eye, and it's only a
matter of time before the administrators and core developers for certain
websites commonly accessed by Tor users get sat down in a steel chair,
and get their fingers broken one by one.
You see where I'm going with this, I don't become overly graphic about it.
But my point is, unless both sides of a communication are 100%
anonymous, the non-anonymous website becomes a liability, not an asset.

I apologize for the wait, I have a busy family life.
To start with, clearnet sites have no real incentive to protect their
users, as I have stated before.
For proof of this, consider any public IRC network in existence.
IRC networks really loath proxy users, especially Tor users, because Tor
makes it easy.
Some may argue that this is purely an administrative concern, that there
are ways to ban disruptive users without gzlining all proxy users, but
isn't that the case with all clearnet services?
Clearnet website admins hate anonymous users, they see them as trouble.
We make their lives difficult.
Website admins generally like seeing your IP addresses, and don't like
it when they change, they don't like it when you don't trust them with
your privacy, and don't see a conflict when they blab to the cops.
Clearnet site admins don't see that they have a responsibility, and that
that responsibility is not to the authorities, it is to their users who
trust them.
Some other things to consider include the fact that security, of which
anonymity is an important part, regardless of what so-called security
professionals will claim, is only as strongest as the weakest link, and
by this, i don't just mean the thinnest point in onion routing, which is
just before the introduction point, where there is only a single layer
of TLS, I also mean that if there is an activist or individual who uses
his or her true legal name, and his or her pseudonym is casually
associated with that true legal name, that person puts all real
anonymous or pseudonymous individuals at risk, if for no other reason,
then because that individual sees nothing wrong with telling everything
he or she knows to the authorities.
Surely, she thinks, there is nothing I could say that the authorities
couldn't get from pulling it up on their own computers?
The problem is people will be tricked into believing that you, like
them, value anonymity as highly as they do, and you, like them, will
protect not just your own anonymity, but their own.
They are incorrect for believing this, but you are wrong for betraying
that trust.
Although Tor needs to be vastly redesigned and improved before I'd
recommend that everyone use Tor location-hidden services for everything
as a matter of course, I do believe that all services should be
protected more the the users they expect to serve.
Since those servers contain logs, hashes of passwords, or even worse,
cleartext passwords, such as those contained by the XMPP administrators,
they are an obvious target for Tor users, and Tor users are often
involved in activism and global citizenship projects that make national
government agencies nervous.
It is important that Tor users be protected, and if Tor core developers
and the administrators for the centralized Tor directories cannot
understand that, they should find something else to do with their time.

What accountability? You mean the nice kind policemen in their blue
shirts and shiny Justice-delivering guns?
Sure, the governments of the world only have our best interests at
heart, the police don't serve criminals, and the world is a perfectly
nice place where bad people never get away with anything.
The problem lies in the assumption that laws are written by the people.
They are not. They are written by elite criminals.
The laws are only there to make us feel like Justice is an actual thing.
Justice does not exist, not in this world.
The governments of the world, especially Interpol and other treaty-based
organizations, are not there to protect us, or to serve us, or to make
bad men go away.
They are run by bad men, and they want to exploit us in every
conceivable way.
With that in mind, Tor and Bitcoin are ways for activists and global
citizens to defend themselves from the criminal elite, the governments
that work for those criminal elites, and to build a society that
reflects the values and principles of the people.
People that believe that democracy will ever exist in a society where
activists attempt to "work from within" are deluded.
If you want to replace a plutocratic society, the very first step is
taking the plutocrats out of the picture.
This means revolution, possibly a very bloody one. Anything else is
wasting time.
Knowing that the only solution is a possibly-bloody revolution means
that anonymity is a very valuable thing, and that you should be able to
build trust relationships with people independent of government
authority and regulation.

Thank you.
To elaborate on those points:
  1) Encrypted end-to-end (or "Tor" to "Tor")
The end to end encryption (AKA "E2E") is one of the most important
design aspects that could possibly exist.
  2) Therefore not dependent on SSL
SSL/TLS would be fine it they did not rely on Certificate Authorities or
DANE (DNS-based certificate authorities).
TLS would be fine if self-signed certificates were not treated
differently, and a more decentralized method of certificate verification
was used instead.
However, because TLS relies on CAs, it's complete crap and the entire
concept should be discarded and replaced.
Yes, I know Tor uses TLS for circuits. Tor does not use CAs, or at least
I bloody well hope not.
  3) Hidden services are automatically stream isolated?
I have not seen this in practice. There are TorRC options that will
instruct Tor to isolate ports and addresses (including hidden services)
for Tor circuits, but these options are, well, optional.
  4) Saves exit node bandwidth
Exit nodes are vitally important, since they shoulder a lot of legal risk.
It is important to offload that role as much as possible.
  5) Political statement about privacy
There is that, too.
  6) Server makes a Statement
This is pretty important.

Raynardine is not my only identity, so I can appreciate the multi-tiered
privacy management tactic.
I appreciate the feedback. I would argue that all lawmakers are
criminals by default, but that is another discussion, for another day.
Privacy is a trade-off, but again, I'd prefer not discussing the
pragmatics of this today.
There is something I would, actually, like to discuss here on Tor-Users,
but I'll create a new thread for that.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Directory Server Decentralization 
I just wanted to ask here in Tor-Talk where the efforts to decentralize
the Tor directory servers have gone so far?
How far along is the Bridge Community idea?
How far along is the Directory Server decentralization in general?
How is the idea of breaking up the Tor relay list into smaller groups to
frustrate efforts to block Tor in certain countries?
Has anyone broached the idea of more isolated Bridge communities with
their own independent directories, yet?
What about Directory Community Federation, where independent bridge
communities can share limited relay information with each other, but not
to the public relay directories?
What about the ability to run Tor directory servers on specialized
private OpenVPN networks?
What about the idea of being able to easily create custom "spins" of the
Tor Browser Bundle for use over private VPN networks or special private
bridge relay networks?
What about the ability to run Tor "Gateways" which act as a gateway
between private bridge communities and the relays they use there, and
the public global relay network?
Has any of this been suggested before? If it has, has any work gone into
introducing these features into mainline Tor?
Thank you for your time, and I appreciate any feedback on any of these

Generally, yes.
I said that I would be willing to help host and possibly maintain the
debian repository if no one else volunteered, if I remember correctly.
I also said that I thought that more participation on subjects such as a
debian repository would be apparent if a hidden service gateway to the
discussion list was put together, and offered to host it.
This was in the "Attracting more community input on Tor issues" thread
and before.
My first post here was "Good evening, Gentlemen," and the topic of a TBB
debian package was brought up shortly after that, if memory serves.
The tor-talk archive shows the relevant post as being here:

Then what would you do about ISPs that trivially innumerate the entire
public relay list from a directory authority, and block every last one
of them? What happens if a government (such as the United States)
demands the private keys for the Directory Authorities? Would you even
know if it has already happened years ago?
A unified concensus on the relay list (for the public relays in
relatively free countries) is fine and all, but what about the less free
What if many countries together begin null-routing Tor relays in their
BGP routers?
You would do nothing?

Hmm. I don't think a DHT is strictly-speaking what I'd recommend, but if
a bunch of men with guns arrested the administrators of the directory
authorities and demanding their private keys, I doubt that those
administrators could really limit the scope of damage.
Tor is not a toy, real people use it for real citizenship.
After reading about PIR-Tor, I am not amused and not pleased.
I'm sure you guys would not care if I left, and you probably wouldn't
care if those I know also left Tor, but if you guys do not take this
matter seriously, Tor will become irrelevant.
