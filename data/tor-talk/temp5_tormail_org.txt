Running a non-exit Tor relay on Linux and have iptables set up to block
inbound and outbound RFC1918 addresses on the outside interface. Notice in
the firewall logs several seemingly random private IP addresses connection
attempts to my relay port getting dropped on the outside over the past few
months. The MAC address associated with these matches my ISP's default
Does Tor do some type of loopback on the outside int.? Or is my ISP doing
something peculiar with NAT?

Assuming it's my ISP, is there any way to configure my relay to discourage
clients in my AS from using it as an entry point?
PS. Should I be asking this on the relays list instead?

I think this is the case- that my ISP forgot. Either that, or they are
being cheap and giving other customers private IPs and NATting Internet
traffic for them. It would sort of work, unless they attempt to access an
Internet resource (like my Tor relay) that happens to be inside their own
Am block it both ways, that's how I noticed this traffic in the first
place! :)
Since I'm just dropping the invalid traffic, it would save time on the
clients ends if they contacted a relay other than mine. I'm on a
relatively small ISP, so it's just a handful of clients that would be
affected though.
Thanks for the feedback, all. I'll just ignore the log entries, and maybe
followup with my ISP on what they are thinking/smoking.
