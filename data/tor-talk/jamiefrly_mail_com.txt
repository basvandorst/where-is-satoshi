@_subject: [tor-talk] apt-get over tor 
What are the dangers of using apt-get over Tor?
 Is privoxy + Tor the safest way to go? What attacks are possible? Any idea if there a way to setup a iptables firewall to prevent leaks? I don't think it currently leaks although should there be a risk introduced in the future a firewall that could protect against it would be ideal I think.
What about curl?
 Any idea how to do this with curl?
 Or proxychains?
