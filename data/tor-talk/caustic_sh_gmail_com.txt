@_subject: [tor-talk] Interest in Contributing to Tor 
============================== START ==============================
I am a junior student at International Institute of Information Technology,
Hyderabad with major in Computer Science and Security, and I am very
interested in working for your organization this summer and further. I have
a strong background in information security and algorithms. I strongly
believe in the cause that you are fighting for - free/open Internet for
all, and would like to support you by contributing to the code.
I have been through the paper by Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson,
"Design of a blocking-resistant anonymity system" and your work aroused my
I am trying to build up my knowledge in the field of information security
with some hands-on experience, through projects.
The paper by Dingledine, Mathewson had a lot of proposals for making Tor
blocking-resistant, but in your list of proposed projects I only found a
project for implementing a HTTPS server in the list of project ideas. What
is the current status of implementation of ideas listed? I would like to
contribute by into the field of  algorithms and cryptography by
implementing more ideas to make it even more blocking-resistant.
Please let me know what are the projects and ideas having maximum priority
, so that I can start working on them right away.
Thanks & Regards,
