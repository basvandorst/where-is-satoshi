I've installed your "only tor & provoxy" package, but it seems so, that
no user will be created by this package, how can I fix that?

@_subject: More bad tor server? 
could it be, that there are more and more "bad" tor exit server? Because
I've some times ad frames around the main pages or only ad pages.
There're more experiences?

@_subject: Precompiled tor binary for openwrt/dd-wrt? 
I want to use openwrt [ that is an open source
firmware for linksys router. It use a special package system
But their tor package
[ is very old:
So I want to ask, if there is any chance, that tor would offer a
precomplied openwrt packages (used by dd-wrt
[ too).
I asked, because I've no linux to compile that packages, and linksys
router and openwrt/dd-wrt is used by many project like freifunk
[ and fon
[ so there could be many people, that could that
tor package for running servers.

Thank you very much!
It seems so, that my linksys has some problems.
After installing a fresh OpenWRT and your packages:
root at OpenWrt:~# ipkg install
root at OpenWrt:~# ipkg install
root at OpenWrt:~# ipkg install
root at OpenWrt:~# ipkg install
root at OpenWrt:~# ipkg install
And setting that simple client configuration:
root at OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/tor/torrc
SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
SocksListenAddress 192.168.xxx.xxx
SocksPolicy accept 192.168.xxx.0/24
SocksPolicy reject *
Log debug stderr

User tor
Group tor

I get that error:

there is an /dev/urandom, but the load is very high... So that could be
the reason...
Perhaps it is an idea to create to package (urandom and random usage).
