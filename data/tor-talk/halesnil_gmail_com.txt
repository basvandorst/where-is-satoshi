@_subject: network connection 
There is message in log:
[notice] conn_close_if_marked(): Something wrong with your network connection? We tried to write () bytes to addr [scrubbed] (fd 12, type OR, state 5) but timed out. (Marked at main.c:715)
Several like entries every day. Sites loaded normal speed when tor first started, loaded very slowly after entries. Didn't touch router or anything. How to find out what's wrong with connection?
Thank you for help.

@_subject: exit node back to user 
Onion History Executive Summary in Hidden Wiki said traffic coming back from exit node to user was in clear text. Is this still true, or out of If there is hardware tap, or some kind local tap, is result same as not using tor?

I meant like this:
                             My Computer-----------------*Local Tap-*-------------------[first node]------    -------   -------Destination
I think you meant traffic going out from My Computer is encrypted, so *Local Tap *can't read it. Right?
*Traffic coming back from Destination must pass through [first node], *Local Tap*, before reaching My Computer. Please clarify, does *Local Tap* see unencrpted traffic between [first node] and My Computer?
