@_subject: [tor-talk] Hiden service and session integrity 
Hi all
I am new to TOR? and I investigate the possibility of gidden services and i can not find an answer in the docs.
web application "foo" use a classical session to maitain state of the user. Classically user BAR have? IP address and cookie is assigned in the login process. If the right cookie from the right ip address comes for user BAR, server accepts future request
But how it can work thru TOR ? what about scenario that an attacker determine my exit point and somehow stole my authentication cookie and then he can use .exit pseudodomain to route his traffic thru the same exit point?
 (ie gain same ip address as a legitimate client ) ? And is it possible (and how ? ) to run end to end encrypted (ssl) web traffic via tor network ?
Thanx for explanation.
??

There is no motivation to make exploits and other stuff on rare OSses.. ---------- P?vodn? zpr?va ----------

(very!) outdated OS. The OS/2 Warp image linked by the OP is 10 years old.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest there might be some vulns there.

It is deffinietly NOT? funny. Because obsolente?? and old systems with little impact, there would be a littlo possibilkity for backdors nsa? shit and other stuff. ---------- P?vodn? zpr?va ----------

i where considering to start running Tor Relay on retro' operating
systems under virtualized environment and i was particularly interested
in having a Tor Relay running on OS/2 Warp and i was particularly
interesting in having it running on OS/2 Warp [1] .
Are there any aficionado that knows about specific technical limitations
on having Tor to run on OS/2 ?

============================== START ==============================
It is a security by statistics .o) low impact = low motivation

P?edm?t: Re: [tor-talk] Tor-Retro' for OS/2 Warp 4.52 Latest Release (2001) - You're confusing obscurity and security.
- "NSA backdoors" are not the only type of vulnerability.
- Security in software design has come a long way in the past 10 years.
- If this is for a relay, the security impact could be to ALL users of the
Tor network.
Despite the snark at the end of my earlier email, I stand by the general
security concern.

@_subject: [tor-talk] WebRTC over the TOR network 
Hi, all.
There is a api for  real time communicatiohn over web.  It is mean to transfer audio and video P2P between browsers. But, as docs stat,   work only over https
Is there a possibility to run this over TOR network ?
in both scenarios ? ie Tor browser <----> ordinary web server <------> Tor browser
Tor browser <-------> hidden service <-----------> Tor browser Thanx for answer
