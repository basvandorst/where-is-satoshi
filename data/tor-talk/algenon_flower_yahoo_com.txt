@_subject: Best Hardware for TOR server.. 
Hello TOR developers, experienced users
  I am planning on getting my TOR server up again using new hardware. If any of these things won't work well with a TOR server, plz let me know.   Because of difficulty in the past when I was using minimum hardware specs,  I now will be setting up my TOR server on a dedicated machine with this physical architecture:
 P4 processor @ 3GHZ, Intel MB, 2GB DDR2 RAM, 80 GB SATA HD, all behind a  Linksys Firewall Router.
  My service provider will most likely be Comcast cable broadband. **Comcast always adds their own modem, I am wondering if the usual modems they provide will be adequate for use with a TOR server.**
  My main question here is whether or not Comcast's modem will work well with a TOR server, or, if I need to upgrade *that too*... If anyone knows if there is something wrong here, or something I seriously need to improve upon, please reply.    The whole thing will be on RedHat Enterprise Linux.
                                      cheers, Algenon

@_subject: Hello, about Best Hardware... 
Hello Everyone!
  Been away for a little while, internet access lately has been a bit spotty; access has been hotels with unsecured networks (thanks Best Western),,& my laptop at the all niter next to campus. I am still waiting for comcasts rates to go down so I can re-up with them. Some hint there about my budget. Anyhow,  Wow, I am amazed at the reply to this thread, Thanks for all the advice.
    While I did (in my very own way) seem to fall in love with Linksys because it eliminated nearly all alerts from my software firewall, I can see that it sounds to be a weak point for use with TOR.  So, will start by googleing   pfSense  and m0n0wall. Other user friendly suggestions very welcome. I really don't like the notion of setting up a TOR server w/out a firewall. It just sounds like an invitation to certain disaster. Even with a good (as well as I can make it) firewall, I will still watch it nervously. I do have an extra older computer that might work with a Linux version as a firewall, interesting, a new project for me.
  Does anyone have a favorite distro of Linux to work with .rpm versions of TOR? I might change to an easier Linux to use than RHEL if other main OS are better w/TOR.
 Thanks all, will keep you updated as to my progress.
                                  Algenon

@_subject: Fine tuning Tor Server , Vidalia message "namservers failed" 
Hello Tor People!
    I did finally get my Tor server up behind a Linksys NAT firewall on RedHat Enterprise Linux, very happy 'bout that..     Right now server is down until I can get the new intro rates back for my broadband cable(plz don't mooan:), probably about a week. In meantime, I am trying to get as much info as I can to fine tune the future operation of my server. While up, my server often put into log file, (paraphrase)  "all nameservers failed" and then "back up" and displays the IP of the hardwired DNS of my ISP.     certain facts: 1 I had to assign a static IP to my Linux box,                         2 Linksys instructions say to create a static IP, add DNS info from Linksys router to fields for such in Linux Networking, which I did.
    Am I doing this correctly? Is there a better way? Should Tor somehow have its own DNS servers to quier? If that is possible, should I add them to router and Linux networking?
                                                          all suggestions very welcome, peace to all,
                                                                                                                Algenon

@_subject: 20090101 (log data) 
Hello   I just hardly can't believe it what I am hearing about this. From what I get, it sounds like a full on assault on privacy and free speech, the things that make the internet good, has begun.
  I am very sorry to hear the news and am very upset for everybody, especially those in Europe where this seems to be starting.   Am I to believe from the foregoing that potentially having to surrender a Tor servers logs (that do not compromise much) will actually make Tor server operators criminals because they don't "reveal" enough?
                                                                                       Algenon
 -------- Original Message --------
Apparently from: owner-or-talk at freehaven.net
the big, but yet not loud enough protests in Germany about these "new"
laws do imho  relate to the fact that there are much older laws. These
protected exactly against the use of grids of databases concerning citizens,
the obligation to deliver data to authorities and to  to create grids with
for good reasons separate data for authorities.  So the big "They" create new
laws explicitely enforcing what was prohibited yesterday.
 How successfull or actually working that was in daily life is another
 question.
Deep trust in promotional and mass manipulating abilities make me believe
that in a not too far future all these doings may be socially anticipated
by the majority and accepted as necessary.  Reasons? The usual.
To my knowledge not all (or only few) of states have or ever had this
'limited ability' in treating their citizens data. Of course there also
are a few with a higher valency of human rights.
There is a background to what has happened in DE right now, also
concerning our friends from Suomi (hope that's right) as well as people
(friends, too, of course;) from Italy and presently 48 other States.
The bigger picture appears to be the so called "Convention on Cybercrime",
which our beloved goverment (DE) wishes to ratify.
Please take a look at:
(0) The Treaty (choose  english, french (1) The list of states involved, english (2) Is where I found (1), german.  (3) Foebud's website, german
As obvious and natural members of a Council of Europe, the US, Japan,
Azerbaijan, Turkey, South-Africa and others are also supposed to, are
about to, or already have ratified the mentioned paper.  Moving servers to
Russia ?  See list.  (although the Russians didn't even care to sign it,
yet ...)
The treaty (0) is concerned about what they call mutual  assisstance
in fighting computer related crime and the usual paedorist stuff. The treaty itself is absolutely horrifying and has effects much further than
Germany and Europe, reaching out to the US and elsewhere. Article
20 and 21 are interesting, they might be the reason for our law. The
german gov.  and others simply shift the costs of getting and storing data
essential for the intended surveillance.  According to the treaty the
goverments are obliged to somehow get hold of tha data.  So they make a
law forcing isp's and other service providers to do so. Awfully simple.
Read  Article 23 and further about international co-operation agreements.
According to this, telco data can and shall be made available to
authorities of the enlisted states on request and spontanously for the
purpose of criminal investigation.  Hurray.
So far, so bad, but even worse,  data then will leave the originating
legislation.  Of course will, lets say the Ukrainian police obey e.g
german law how long to store and how to use or where to pass data to. (I
do not have any problems with or about Ukrania or Ukranians, just an
example.) So, what happens, if data becomes to be very easily available to
states who never really cared about such odd things like civil rights?
Welcome to an international legal marketplace for telco data.
With a little phantasy we might imagine yottabytes (really much) of logs
being analyzed by whoever wants to, profiling of individuals and tracking
just about anything in communication, and this on a pretty much
international scale. Every day.  Is that new? No, but new in that extent.
Some people might end up in Guantanamo or some other weirdo's prison
without ever knowing what actually hit them. Nowadays mere suspicion is
enough, we have learned.
Quite a nightmare.
As soon as this law in Germany comes into force on 01.01.2009 Tor-ops
_may_ have to hand over logs on request.  It does not criminalize
operators of a node.
Tor's purpose is to provide anonymous access to the net. Period.  So how
much this analyzing of nodes will break anonymity is the interesting
I personally begin to look around for places to set up my node (and
myself;) in other parts of the world.
Suggestions are welcome.

@_subject: 20090101... -> Dänemark 
Eugen,, That sounds like some good news coming from EU!  I hope for success to challenges in Germany to their attempt at repressive law.  I am in US.
As everyone knows, we seem to lead the world in this kind of stuff. I think the whole censorship and control mindset seems to have come into office and vogue in January, 2001, or soon thereafter. I have always had the impression that European attitudes were a bit more sophisticated and insightful than here. I will keep a close eye on events as they transpire here.
  I think that Tor is a great example of the international expression of the need for, and value of, freedom in a world that seems to be becoming ever more controlled and devoid of originality.
                                     Algenon
The details indeed does differ :-)
In Denmark, the implementation of the EU-directive (which is called
'logningsbekendtg?relsen')  is not bad news for Tor-operators.
If you have a Tor-server in Denmark, you don't have to log *anything*!
I have this in writing (from something called IT- og Telestyrelsen), if
anybody is interested.
Regarding to the danish 'version' of Vorratsdatenspeicherung
('logningsbekendtg?relsen'), you only have to log data, that you /know/.
That means, if you eg. have an open access point, then normally you do
not know which physical persons have a specific IP-address, and
therefore you do not have to log that.
If you are non-commercial (eg. Tor-operaters normally are), then you do
not have to log *anything*. That means a private open access point does
not have to be register anything.
So if you want to host a Tor-server somewhere in Denmark, feel free to
contact me by e-mail if i can be at any help.

@_subject: UpDate:,,, Success getting  Server Up behind NAT,,  
Hello Ringo, Csaba and everybody,,
  I did solve the Linksys NAT/RHEL/Tor server puzzle, I think. Server is up and normally I see about 100mbs/sec through it on Vidalia bandwidth graph. Yea! I had to learn a little about routers and network, Tor and RHEL, finally, to whomever is interested, I configured RHEL eth0 to a static IP of my choosing, corresponding to possible assignable IP's from Firewall/Router. Linksys support was good, they advised me of that range. I also had to interpolate other settings from Linksys windows config instructions. Finally, got it right! :),,
  So, server is up and working, thanks to all who tried to help!
 I still have two nagging concerns though. One is that Tor gives me "nameserver failure" notices intermittently, then system seems to go to back up DNS at comcast, as per settings for RHEL static IP. I am not sure what that is about, but it does seem to get resolved and seems to work fine most of the time. Also, I will have to check all info I can to "harden" my server computer. I have seen how many scans go over comcast owned net blocks, running a Tor server without doing *everything* & monitoring system for intrusion attempts just would be asking for failure. Anyhow, I hope for the best, anyone with comments very welcome!                 Algenon
 Can you try pining the DNS backup to see if you can reach it?

Hello experienced TOR ppl,
  I am trying to set up a TOR server on Linux Redhat Enterprise v5,, I am using a Linksys hardware firewall that does have NAT and have modified the system to open ports 9001-9031. I have just installed TOR and Vidalia for Redhat on my system,and, using Vidalia configured TOR ot act as a server. My problem is: (TOR log below)

  I realize I may have become a little obsessed with getting my TOR server up, but for me it represents an important step in my education, and I intend it to be an aid, at least in some small way, to the TOR project.

Hi, Algenon
At Linksys_Port_Forwarding.htm (Port range forwarding) page, I noticed
you have two similar port forwarding rules, but they have different IP
addresses, one is 192.168.1.2, the other is 192.168.1.3, maybe that's
where you problem lies.
Delete the wrong one, and try again.
Thanks for your contribution to the Tor community!

 It sounds like you haven't enabled port forwarding on your firewall.
Even if the ports are unblocked, the traffic might not go to the
server. You need to forward all traffic coming to the firewall on
ports 9001 and 9030 to your tor server.

Go to the advanced tab -> forwarding
set up two applications, ORport, DIRport .. select TCP, select 9001 and 9030, and point them to whatever IP you have on your linux box.
Make sure you tell TOR to advertise your external IP address via torc.

Hello Pei Hanru, experienced TOR users
  I have checked Linksys doc's and I think they were helpful. At present, I think I need to assign a static IP to my RHEL system behind NAT firewall. That seems to include two extra assigned IP numbers, like 196.168.1.20, Then I can use port forwarding set-up on NAT router. I bet this is elementary school for many of you, it took a little while for me :),,  All I need now is the procedure to assign a static IP on RHEL. I am checking that now,, And, Hope it all Works! In any case, thanks to people interested, and additional comments welcome.

Unfortunately, you are doing worse...
What you should do is first figuring out the *actual* private IP address
of your Linux box, then forwarding port 9001 and port 9030 (or port
range 9001-9030 if you like) to *that* address, rather than forwarding
the same port range to three distinct addresses.
It's a good idea to reread port forwarding part of Linksys manual carefully.

I bet this is elementary school for many of you, it took a little while for me :),,  All I need now is the procedure to assign a static IP on RHEL. I am checking that now,, And, Hope it all Works! In any case, thanks to people interested, and additional comments welcome.
                                                            peace,  Algenon

Unfortunately, you are doing worse...
What you should do is first figuring out the *actual* private IP address
of your Linux box, then forwarding port 9001 and port 9030 (or port
range 9001-9030 if you like) to *that* address, rather than forwarding
the same port range to three  distinct addresses.
It's a good idea to reread port forwarding part of Linksys manual carefully.

I am just curious to hear how the people are doing
out Germany way who are being impacted as per the oft
discussed new repression law. I am hoping they having
a good nice time, it must be 6am '08 there right
now... Happy new year to you and don't cave in to the
"creeping repressionism". We are all we have to fight
to be free.

Thank you for the update Eugen. I will be tracking what becomes of us here in the USA. Right now street level biometric scanning, and multiple database interconnection, are becoming more widespread. I am already wondering what will become of us all when, (IF..) "legitimate" street CCTV databases, consumer & gov black project databases become cross linked with national, international biometric scan databases. I love computers in my own small way, but they are giving potential unprecedented power to the "few" to monitor in real time, and potentially control, the many.

After the federal president signed the law, 30 kPeople submitted
their suit against it in the court at Karlsruhe on 31. Dec (the largest
constitutional suit ever by a large margin). AFAIK the plan is to achieve a preliminary injunction first. In any case
the relevant date is 20090101, not 20080101. Only telecommunication
providers (cellular, telephony, possibly VoIP) are/would
be affected at this time -- but, let's see what Karlsruhe will
say to that. If the law is not repealed as unconstitutional,
it would be another major building stone for the new
machtergreifung laws.
 It is quite interesting how global this is. I think
it looks like a silent collusion. If it is indeed that, it's
time to get seriously scared. We need to maintain untrackable
uncensorable communication to any political or activist
group, whatever it takes.

@_subject: Tor-Ramdisk 
Hello Dante
    Are you Mideval Italian?? (No, Just kidding :),  However, no kidding about your efforts to build a RAM only distro that can run as a Tor server. I just tried to access your ftp, but failed. Will try again, it sounds like something I am very interested in.                                                                                                         Algenon
  Hi everyone,
A month ago I developed a small, ramdisk only (ie diskless), linux
system whose only purpose was to run a tor server. The aim of the
project was to meet the following goals:
1) small footprint - i686 (single or SMP) with 256MB+ RAM
2) to run only in ram so nothing survives a reboot
3) to do no logging whatsoever at any level
4) to be secure - GRSEC hardened kernel
5) to run a tor server, allowing for any configuration,
middle/exit/directory, etc
I suspect such a project might be of interest to other Tor operators.
I ran a middle-man node for about 20 days with success
(node-name=RamOnly), but because I compiled statically against GLIBC, I
broke DNS resolution, and so it would not work as an exit node. I've
rebuild the image from scratch compiling against UCLIBC and I'm now in
the testing phase again. I'm running another middle-man/directory
server (node-name=RamOnlyUCLIBC). Here's the url for the howto and the
The kernel is compiled with support for most 100MB and 1GB NIC cards. Any comments or testers would be much appreciated.
More details:
busybox-1.8.2 - minimally configured, compiled with UCLIBC
linux-2.6.23.12 patched with Gentoo's hardening patches (GRSEC)

I run a Tor client on a laptop at easy to access pub wifi access points. What I need to know is, assuming I have disallowed file sharing, ect what info could a wifi host be able to access on my computer? I have heard they could only log my MAC address, the unique code identifying my wifi card. Is more available to an attacker?

@_subject: Tor server behind NAT on Vista,, few configuration questions.. 
Hello Tor developers and experienced users
As an experiment, I a attempting to run a Tor server on windows Vista home premium (I have to wait for another machine to run RedHat Linux Fedora) behind a NAT firewall.   Although I am new to the D-Link hardware firewall I believe I did open ports 443, 9030, 9001 to both incoming and outgoing traffic and so enable my machine running Vista to work as a Tor server. At this point I am restricting all traffic to other Tor servers until I solve some troublesome issues.   Tor log says Dir port reachable, but can't reach OrPort,, Bandwidth graph shows a few bursts of activity, then none. (?)
Humm, will go back to the firewall permissions and look for error, if anyone sees obvious err, please say :),,
  Will post results of Tor server on Vista OS,,
                                                                   Algenon

@_subject: Tor server behind NAT on Vista,, Update,, 
I have Tor 12.1.9  running on windows Vista as a server for a few hours only relaying Tor server (I hope) information. System unexpectedly crashed once, I don't know why.  System stats indicate pretty normal usage,, Log below. Mar 18 01:14:28.812 [Notice] Tor v0.1.2.19. This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Mar 18 01:14:28.812 [Notice] Initialized libevent version 1.3e using method win32. Good.
Mar 18 01:14:28.812 [Notice] Opening OR listener on 0.0.0.0:443
Mar 18 01:14:28.812 [Notice] Opening Directory listener on 0.0.0.0:9030

Mar 18 01:14:28.812 [Notice] Opening Control listener on 127.0.0.1:9051
Mar 18 01:14:29.250 [Notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is 'Expermental1 275E A41D 518D FEAF 4C3A 7102 0640 2FA1 F5F9 54A7'
Mar 18 01:14:34.625 [Notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working.
Mar 18 01:15:03.109 [Notice] Self-testing indicates your DirPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent.
Mar 18 01:15:08.314 [Notice] Performing bandwidth self-test...done.
  One thing I noticed, right now Tor Bandwidth Usage GUI tells me recv:24.56 MB and Sent: 69.23 MB  I am allowing my server to act as Directory Mirror, but, troubling discrepancy between Recv and Sent.  Anyone have a clue about that?
 If it was just passing info between servers it should be near same, right?
   Also, on my machine behind NAT and SPI hardware firewall I am also running Zone Alarm. ZA's logs show a high rate of blocked intrusion attempts, I am currently tracking down some using Whois,, I guess that is just part of the game running a server,,,Comments welcome,, :)
