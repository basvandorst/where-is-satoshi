How difficult would it be for an ISP to monitor your Tor activity from the modem and determine what sites you visit? I only need to know if it would be very hard, impossible, or very possible to do. If it's possible what technique would they use?

Sure, I understand what you mean. I'm assuming a situation that doesn't involve legal issues. This would be illegal surveillance, using average resources with your ISP supporting it for some reason. I think Tor would be able to handle this type surveillance if used correctly.
I would like to know what their procedure would be outside of monitoring ExitNodes. How much effort it would be to examine the packets and get any useful information.

The reason people find problems with Tor is because the importance of privacy is hidden in a mystery. Most people don't understand the reason Tor exist so, how can they judge it? The problem is that it's easier to focus on evil than it is to focus on good. The good Tor offers is much weightier than the bad. The good is harder to see because it's not as tangible as the bad. For those that understand the details behind the importance of privacy, the good is much weightier than the bad. This is just a matter of truly understanding the problem Tor was designed to handle. Can the people finding problems with Tor correctly describe problem Tor was designed to handle?  -------- Original Message --------

I'll read some documentation about these methods. Are there recommended sources?
