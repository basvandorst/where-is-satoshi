[cross-posted on tor-talk and tor-relays]
i've found that the Tor GoodBadISPs list [1] is somewhat outdated on
current hosts that allow Tor (exit) relays to be hosted. i'm trying to
find a cheap host that allows exits to be operated from their services,
and navigating the outdated list and finding an operator that isn't
extremely expensive is time consuming (some entries go back to 2010!).
should the community start a revamp project (or start a whole new list)?
i'd be willing to donate my time to help get this started if need be.

i'm running a (few) non-exit relays on digitalocean, for example:
i haven't gotten any complaints because of the lack of an exit policy; the
choice comes from their TOS option that you are legally liable for all
traffic going in and out of the server.
i suggest just turning on a non-exit policy and just donate the traffic as
a middle or guard node.
