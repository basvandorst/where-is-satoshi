@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor IP problem or Tor User-Agent problem? 
I recently tried to login into my Yahoo! webmail via Tor.
It asked for a CAPTCHA then informed me that unless I answered a security question I could not login.? This is because "you are logging in from a device we do not recognize" and "you are using a browser which you have not previously used."
I used a Tor ExitNode which was not in my normal country.
I note from browserspy.dk that the Tor User-Agent is Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0
Question: is this really a "device" or "browser" problem or is it more likely to be a IP issue.??

@_subject: [tor-talk] Harvard student used Tor to send bomb threats, 
Three points about this story.
First, if the student had used a VPN then the network would only have seen his VPN IP not the entry node IP.? Right?
Second, who is to say that the 'real' perp was not using a different non-University network?? The fact that the e-mail was sent from a Tor exit node and there is a log of a Tor entry node does not ipso facto indicate that the two communications are connected even if they occured at roughly the same time.? Any number of other people on other networks could have been using Tor and sent the illicit e-mail.
Third, I was under the impression that the case against Jeremy Hammond also involved correlating Tor entry node activity with Tor exit node activity on the target websites. However, having just looked at the inditement, I may be wrong as Tor is not mentioned.? Perhaps I read it in a news story rather than a court file?

See The search function doesn't work but look at the detail on Pages 30-33.
The point is that Hammond's IP was accessing Tor at the same time as he was in his residence and / or in contact with CW-1 (Monsegur I assume). ?

Thank you for your comments.
Presumably if Hammond (or anyone) had used a VPN to hide his use of Tor then no connection could have been made to him (unless, somehow, the authorities could acquire the logs of the VPN provider which would prove he accessed Tor).
What is an "IRC bounce"?
My impression of using Tor and IRC is that you have a static exit node unlike when you are using HTTP/S.? Is this true, and if so, does it matter?? Do you have a source for the 13 years Tor ban?? Since he was sentenced to 10 years (of which how much might he serve considering his 'lack of remorse' and prior convictions) does his incarceration time count?
Finally, since you were at the sentence, why did he plead guilty?? I got the impression that the case would have taken years to get to trial as he was not permitted to review the evidence considering he was denied bail.? Or were there other reasons?? He was, after all, 'guilty'.

?  I was at his sentencing, and can tell you a couple of things about the case.? As it says in the complaint, authorities relied on an informant to say when Jeremy Hammond went offline.? At no point did they say that his location was leaked.? They went to pretty great lengths to force him offline to confirm that he was "Anarchaos" -- but because the link was initially so tenuous, even setting up an IRC bounce would have thwarted those correlation efforts.
?  If the feds are watching a chatroom and you don't have a persistent connection, they can track when you enter and exit, even if they don't know where you're physically located.? If you're in contact with an informant, they're giving all of your chats and personal details to their keepers.? Those two things together can be used to target for surveillance (legally, with a warrant).
?  It's an awful situation, but has nothing to do with Tor.? In fact, he's restricted from using Tor explicitly for the next 13 years because they couldn't track his location.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Harvard student used Tor to send bomb threats, 
any further action since then.
My point was that presumably the authorities assumed that the perp would be using the university network to make the threats and hence checked to see who had connected to a known Tor IP entry node.
Had the perp used a Starbucks network, mobile dongle, or hijacked wifi connection then no such connection would have been made.
Also, am I right to think that if he had used a bridge then the IP logged would have been the bridge IP rather than the Tor entry node IP?? Is this traceable?? Are bridge addresses public?
Bobby Brewster:
the perp confessed to guilt during interview. not sure if there's been
any further action since then.
law enforcment was monitoring when he was logged into the tor network,
in addition to getting information from monsegur as to when he
supposedly logged off. the totality of the evidence against hammond
may never be reported since he plead guilty rather than going to trial.

I was experimenting using Tor and Thunderbird by entering 127.0.0.1: 9150 in the TB Preferences.
I used my Gmail account and hence Gmail's SMTP server.
I checked the headers of the message I sent to Gmail and the IP was a Tor exit node.
However, I am wondering whether using Tor and an e-mail client is as safe as using webmail when using the TBB.
My point is that I don't know to what extent the message is entirely encrypted.
For example, in a message send by Thunderbird there exists in addition to the message body:
cc/bcc (perhaps)
To what extent is this so-called metadata also encrypted?  This may be a stupid question for which the answer is 'obvious' but I would like to know.

Yes. I had looked at it before.  I was interested in knowing the answers to the above question if one 'manually' configures TB and Tor as I mentioned above.
Also, if one wants to send HTML enabled e-mail then you cannot do that with TorBirdy.
So, hence, I would still like to know the answers to my original questions.  Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Benefits of Running TBB in a VM? 
What are the benefits of running TBB in a VM? AIUI, there are two advantages.
1.	If malware infects the VM, then just the VM is compromised. If your Windows/Mac/Linux system is infected, then your entire system is affected (yes, I realise that it should be only the user account for Linux unless you are root).
2.	If your system is comprimised, your real IP cannot be discerned.  For example, in my non-VM Ubuntu machine, my wlan0 IP is listed as 192.168.1.50. However, on my NAT'd VirtualBox Ubuntu, there is no wlan0, only eth1. This gives an IP of 10.0.2.15 which is obviously not the IP assigned by my ISP. Does this make sense?  Are there other benefits?  Any disadvantages?  Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Benefits of Running TBB in a VM? 
Currently, my Tor use model is as follows:
Me (TBB in Ubuntu) ---> VPN ---> Tor (entry node) ---> Tor network
I could, instead, do:
Me (TBB Ubuntu VM) ---> VPN (configured in VM) ---> Tor (entry node) ---> Tor network
However, from what I've read, there isn't really any advantages to using a VM unless the non-VM system has been compromised (e.g. trojan / rootkit / whatever).
Also, one thing I'm unclear about is, if one is using a VM, whether a bridged or NAT'd connection is superior.
The only difference I can see is that the bridge provides a 192.168.x.x address while the NAT provides a 10.0.2.x address. Both appear as the interface eth1.
Any opinions?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Benefits of Running TBB in a VM? 
I don't understand this. If my Ubuntu system has a virus / rootkit / whatever then what I do on it is compromised.
The VM is, in effect, a seperate OS. How would it be affected by the malware on the non-VM system?
Bobby Brewster:
if your non-VM host system has been compromised, there is absolutely no
notable advantage to using a vm.? your vm will be affected by the
malware that sits on the host system.? however, if you use a vm and the
vm gets infected by malware, you have an extra layer of protection
against the malware infecting your host system. thus, with the snapshot
method i described, you can effectively wipe away malware in certain
from an anonymity standpoint, whether running from your host or from a
vm, malware with a phone home system has a greater chance of
successfully identifying you than if you used a system like whonix.
for anonymity, it doesn't make any difference. you're better off running
it as an "internal network" and using an additional vm as a gateway that
has rules to push all traffic through the tor network.

Here is how I use SSH with Tor.
torsocks ssh username at domain.
e.g. torsocks ssh wierdo at domain.com
I have checked on Wireshark and it looks like my IP connects to a tor entry node (before the traffic passes through the Tor network).
There are apparently lots of other ways to use Tor with SSH. Indeed, the official documentation ( seems to only mention torsocks as an afterthought.
Is there any reason NOT to use torsocks?

 Please say more about setting up the socat
 tunnel with Tor. The socat
 manpage is
 complex, and coverage in

 somewhat confusing.
Agreed - I liked torsocks because it is so simple to use. Socat seems vastly more complex with multiple command line options (TCP4-LISTEN:,bind=,fork,reuseaddr for example). I would like to see a professionally written guide on how to use SSH with socat or al least some accurate instructions for the command line.
For example, in garamp's example above, what does 'proxycommand' actually represent when using Tor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How does DNS work with .onion addresses? 
I know that when the TBB connects to a 'normal' .com or .org or whatever address then the DNS resolution is done by the exit node.? There is no need anymore (not for several years now) for the client to set-up DNS manually (as used to be the case with Polipo or Privoxy).
However, how does DNS work for .onion?? I assume that each exit node understands how to route traffic for all .onion addresses? How does it know how to direct the client request?
Is it possible for DNS to leak with .onion?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bad Exit Nodes. 
I recently watched the video by Adrian Crenshaw (IronGeek) on Youtube about how to use darknets and Tor effectively.
One of his concerns was about the individuals or organisations that are running exit nodes.
What is to stop someone from setting up an exit node and a) sniffing all traffic or specifically non-SSL usernames and passwords and b) using SSLStrip to access SSL usernames and passwords?
I know this has been done in the past - I am talking about the situation today.
How could a person who is sniffing / stripping exit traffic be detected?
Also, how are bad nodes determined. For example, iiioooeee is a bad node. Why?  What makes it bad?  It is not an exit node.
However, HKT01 is an exit node that is marked bad.  Why?  Interestingly, HKT02 which is also an exit node is not marked bad even though they are on the same subnet as HKT01.

@_author: Bobby Brewster 
@_subject: [tor-talk] How does DNS work with .onion addresses? 
Thank you for your informative response.
connect request for a .onion >>>address and recognises it as a hidden service request. Your Tor client then performs the hidden-service point in the hidden service distributed >>>hash table (as your traffic never leaves the Tor network, there's no exit node involved). I should have read the Tor Project documentation about hidden services first.
I take your point: the client requests the .onion address, goes to the distributed hash table in the directory server, learns where the introduction nodes are for that .onion address, and sets up a rendez-vous point. Hence, as you point out, all is done within the Tor network and hence there is no need for DNS resolution.
 are people who survey DNS, and they report that there are quite a lot of requests for .onion. Some of >>>these are people clicking on .onion links without Tor, but some could be the result of DNS leaks.
I would hope that if one is using the TBB then such leakage would not occur.
There is an exception to this rule. If you use DNSPort + TransPort +
VirtualAddrNetwork + AutomapHostsOnResolve, Tor provides a DNS resolver.
And if you perform an A/AAAA record lookup for a .onion domain against
that DNS resolver, then it will pick a unique IP address from a pool you
specified (10.0.0.0/8 or similar) and return that. It will then remember
the Onion->IP mapping. It is then your job to intercept connections to
those IPs on your router and forward them to the host/port specified in
TransPort. Tor will see those connections and figure out the hidden
service you're trying to connect to by reversing the Onion->IP mapping
that it provided earlier during the DNS lookup.
This is why any device on my LAN can talk to hidden services, without
having to install Tor on each of them, albeit less securely than if
they all had Tor installed locally of course.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Downloading Programs with TBB - dangerous??? 
The only thing I can add is that when I downloaded a large PDF and loaded Wireshark up, there was a steady stream of traffic until Firefox told me that the download had been completed. Also, the connections were between my IP and the IP of the Tor entry node (as confirmed in blutmagie). This suggests that the download itself did happen within the Tor network.
That used to be the norm, but I believe the message was changed in later TB versions.? Which version are you using?
I'm not sure I've seen that warning lately, for just saving a PDF.
Pretty much the same precautions as regular surfing, as far as "dangerous" files - whether inside Tor / Torbrowser or not.
The advice is generally, don't open downloaded files while online. Certainly not in or using Torbrowser (like a PDF, using built PDF viewer).
But that viewer isn't AS big of an anonymity breaking threat as using 3rd party software over the Tor network.? They don't always follow the Tor proxy rules.
For some (like Thunderbird) people have gone to great lengths to create software / plugins, etc., to make sure it stays inside the Tor network.? Even those methods aren't 100% foolproof, 100% of the time.
Much depends on whether using 3rd party software for the downloading, or even Fx addons used in Torbrowser.? If just d/l a PDF or txt file, etc., saving it to disk / DVD - from the browser save window isn't a problem.
Of course, most any file could be malicious or its extension be intentionally mislabeled.
The addons may be OK, or they may leak data like real IPa, or something else.? One shouldn't assume because they're listed on Mozilla AMO, that they maintain anonymity over Tor.? They might - but they might not.

They are identified as a person of interest by visiting

 then *in real

 'identifying as

 GD
But how can the person's computer be identified since all that is seen is the connection between the exit node and the destination target_website.com
The point, surely, is that real time code injection should not be possible since no-one can trace the connection from the exit node back to the user.
I am not saying that the user cannot be traced e.g. if he logs into his own webmail account via Tor; I am saying that the trace should not occur due to the Tor network. Does this make sense?
