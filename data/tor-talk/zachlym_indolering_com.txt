@_subject: [tor-talk] Exit Enclaves 
I am doing page load tests on an exit enclave (duckduckgo.com) over a period
of a few weeks.  I am worried that I will exit at other nodes and reach the
public duckduckgo site.
The documentation is somewhat ambiguous on this point: If a service provides
an enclave node, the standard Tor out-proxy's are *not* used, correct?
Thank you,
-Zach Lym
P.S. Would using paid proxy's which exit in other continents improve
external validity?
