@_subject: [tor-talk] Free Decentralized VOIP over Tor 
Hi Terry,
Mumble, best known as a voice groupchat software for gamers, has been
the subject of some Tor experiments, because it has Push to Talk support
to help deal with high latency, and because it can be configured to use
TCP only--unlike most VoiP applications, which use a combination of TCP
and UDP. There are both desktop and mobile clients, and self-hosting a
Mumble instance on a hidden service is feasible. This isn't federated,
AFAIK, though, unlike SIP or XMPP voice chat, so it would only scale to
the smallish group that was using the same Mumble service.
See e.g.

Hi Hartmut,
Assuming that you mean the Tor Browser Bundle, simply uncompress
(i.e. tar xvf or equivalent commands in a GUI package manager) the new
Tor Browser tarball to the same destination directory as your existing
For a system Tor daemon, updating the package will not interfere with
the Tor daemon's config.
Hope this helps,

Did you try by using the web whois tool provided at or did you use a Torified command-line whois? I can reproduce the 201 error
on the former, but the latter worked after two tries (first try told me that
I had exceeded the rate limit and had to wait 85 more seconds).
whois servers are notorious for having very tight rate limiting on requests;
maybe the RIPE web app is even more limiting.

Here's the source, from 8 February:
Head of Roskomnadzor (.ru telco regulatory agency, currently
responsible for the Unified Register of banned sites) supports the
idea of blocking anonymizers incl. Tor without a court order. Says
it'll be difficult but his agency is ready to try if given legal
authority. Leonid Levin, head of Duma IT committee, plans to move a
bill through committee to do just that.
Levin also seems to think it'll be technically challenging. No
timetable here for debates/voting on any bill and I don't know much
about the Duma calendar, but I will keep an eye on it.

Oops, I meant 5 February--it's even right there in the url. :-P
According to this article, the part of this bill that might be
overreach is that Russian business is heavily VPN- and
proxy-dependent. A regulation trying to impose ID requirements on
users of public wifi died because even the City of Moscow (which
provides wifi in public parks, awesome) disn't want to enforce it. I
wonder if this will die similarly.

Fair enough; the ??? article cited 25 percent of Russian Internet
users as being VPN/proxy users and also mentioned the reliance of
particular sectors like ATMs on proxied connections. It's hard to know
what such a data point means without comparison to other countries,
I hope, and suspect, that you're correct, especially if this has been
debated every year since 2012 with no result.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Configuring a Tor relay 
Hello Raymond,
Unfortunately there is currently no such program in existence, probably because
most relays in existence are running on UNIX-like platforms. There,
you can use the usual operating system interfaces for starting and stopping
daemons (background processes) or use something like
 Being a text application, it can be run remotely
and accessed via ssh. One could run an instance of this for each
Tor relay one was administering, and keep them in separate terminal sessions
or collect them all using something like "screen" or "tmux".
The only Tor controller tool of which I am aware for Windows is Vidalia, which
is unmaintained and abandoned for the past several years, and anyway did not
have the capacity to control remote Tor instances. Perhaps you could create
a new one yourself. :)
Hope this helps,

Not sure what the significance of this is in context.
Not nearly as many as originally reported, and they were all making the
mistake of using a couple of centralized hosting providers.
Hosting security can't really be delegated.
Didn't happen, probably in part because dirauths are geographically distributed
and this would require international cooperation of LEAs, something they
aren't great at.
Attack was foiled the same day (obvious family of new relays was obvious),
and Lizard Squad spent the day on  and  trying to save face
by claiming they hadn't even meant to attack anything.
Also they weren't even attacking the dirauths, they were ignorantly trying to
perform a Sibyl attack, which the existence of dirauths makes impossible.
Not important, unless you fundamentally misunderstand hidden services.
If you want a hidden service not to be indexable, the
"stealth" authentication protocol of HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient (in
which each authorized client gets its own domain, which doesn't
resolve without the appropriate authentication key) is at your
disposal. Anyone should assume that anything offered via a server that
does not require authentication to see its content can and will be indexed.
Public "hidden services" are hidden in the sense that the hosting location is
obfuscated, not in the sense that they can't be webcrawled. That's out of scope
(and also one of the reasons why "hidden service" is an unfortunate and
imprecise name). There are even YaCy (p2p search bot) instances running inside
the .onion TLD, as well as several search engines.
More indexing could make the public content on .onion more useful, and it would
also be a handy reminder to people (like you) that .onion content is public,
unless it uses authentication as I mentioned above.
Tor has been giving talks to LEOs since its initial
release as a public software project. This isn't a new thing. It's also probably
a good thing; it gives Tor principals a chance to learn how LEOs are using Tor,
and it also gives them a chance to explain that Tor has been and remains a
neutral conduit for data. If Tor didn't speak to LEOs, there probably would be
even more misguided harassment of exit operators for content they don't control,
Tor needs a PR firm because it's getting drawn into pretty murky political
waters, with Pando et al. on one side and NSA Director Mike
"secure backdoors are possible" Rogers on the other. Tor's opponents have many
PR firms and lobbyists, so it stands to reason that Tor needs them too.
Further, who else is on a particular PR firm or lobbyist's client list doesn't
seem very meaningful to me. Such entities tend to be rather disgustingly
apolitical. Having the same firm as Verizon probably just means
that's one of the firms that works in the networking/telecommunications industry
and has experience.
Not sure what the significance of this is in context.

I want to reiterate and emphasize this point. Had Lizard Squad attacked i2p
instead, the attack would've succeeded and there would've been nobody even able
to notice it had happened, because i2p doesn't use dirauths and so is vulnerable
to network sibyls (as stated in their own documentation).

Not sure why you're linking this classic paper,
but that is also a problem torproject is attempting to solve,
for example with reproducible builds.
Some degree of centralization of the directory is,
for now, the only way to prevent an attacker from owning everything
simply by dumping a lot of bandwidth onto the network
(what Lizard Squad attempted to do). Networks like i2p and bitcoin
are to a greater extent vulnerable to that than Tor is,
because i2p and bitcoin didn't even consider resistance to network sibyls
as part of their design.

You're welcome to dislike it, but as str4d just confirmed,
there's currently no decentralized solution that offers an equivalent ability
to prevent takeovers of the network by dumping bandwidth onto the network.
It was interesting to hear about some of the alternatives
that don't rely on a directory authority concept,
but it sounds like none are as mature yet.
I agree, but the basic problem is that threat modelling is hard.
I think Tor (in its FAQ and other documents) is open as to its limitations,
which has not always been the case with other technologies/networks.
And of course even exhaustive documentation of opsec
(which would somehow have to foresee every application Tor was put to)
won't stop people motivated by profit or blinded by hubris from cutting corners.
is a nice introductory text, but it's just that, an introduction.
Ultimately the advice has to be tailored to the particular user(s).
This for example sounds like doing some stuff that sounded good at the time,
absent any particular threat model.

@_subject: [tor-talk] the privacy of public tor descriptor data 
Tor has never claimed to promote the privacy and anonymity of relays;
that would be silly, given that relays are part of a public directory.
Tor does promote the anonymity of its users, and any right of relay operators
not to be mildly questioned must be secondary to that.
It's reasonable to ask what's up with a MyFamily-less, ContactInfo-less
group of new relays hosted at a university,
because, unfortunately, paying attention to exactly that sort of phenomenon
would have allowed Tor to detect and prevent the hidden service deanonymization
attack perpetrated by US-CERT (based at but independent from cmu.edu)
in the cancelled Black Hat talk.
Further, for the same reason, it's worth asking whether someone running relays
for research purposes on the live Tor network,
which people do depend on for anonymity, is performing human subjects research,
which ought to require ethics review board approval at a reputable university.
If the choice is between making some inquiries about a relay operator
and letting that relay operator possibly deanonymize users,
the choice is obvious.

@_author: W. Greenhouse 
@_subject: [tor-talk] the privacy of public tor descriptor data 
I wouldn't have cared much, actually. I'm not a Tor developer nor a dirauth
operator nor anything else other than a user who has contributed relays
(without ContactInfo, as it happens). I don't think it makes sense to make
ContactInfo compulsory, but groups of relays on the same AS without contact
or family set should at least be provisionally considered to be related.
If the relay operator hadn't responded, the appropriate response in my opinion
(which is not binding on anyone else) would have been
to observe these relays closely in case the research turned out to involve
active attacks on the network which might make it more possible for third parties
to hurt Tor.
Security research unfortunately is still a "Wild West" field and,
without knowing whether they intended it this way or not, it's certainly the case
that the US-CERT research I mentioned made it more dangerous for a time for
anyone to use or host a hidden service (because the radioactive breadcrumbs
were left for anyone to see). I know that a lot of universities want to
contribute to Tor, but they tend to be pretty obvious about it with setting of
families and nicknames.
Most research can be done on testing networks without exposing human users
, and tor even supplies the software to run test networks.
Risky research on human Tor users should require review board approval
at the university at a minimum, just like testing drugs on humans does.
(Actually it's harder than that, because obtaining "informed consent" from all
users to someone else's "research" is not possible in an anonymous network.)

Ack. I wouldn't want Tor to be anything but an open protocol/network.
That said, the lack of network security researchers treating their research
as human subjects research when human subjects can be put at risk by it is

CS/IT/EE programs have largely not yet adapted to the reality that research
on a public network is research on human beings,
as much as medicine or psychology or even behavioral economics research is.
Those fields subject their researchers to institutional review boards.
It'd be nice to think that all security research that operates
on public networks will get rigorous institutional review board and
legal scrutiny at the home institution, as well as result in the creation
of open access data and results. But none of these things are true at present.
As gparpamp says, it's a fine line. Obviously if a real vulnerability
or possible improvement to Tor results from this research
*and* we get to read about it (that all-important open access piece),
that would be an excellent outcome. However none of these things are guaranteed
from current [lack of] oversight of academic security research,
which still bills itself as research on machines and not on their users.

Completely false. For example, if a corporation funds medical research
at a university, that still requires IRB approval.
Lack of government funding is not some kind of
workaround for lack of ethical review in academic departments that aren't
"The political fabric of the world" doesn't sound like a coherent enough thing
for anyone to reason about ethically. That could mean anything.
Tor's users consent to using it. The proper analogy would be if an
overlay network like Tor somehow forced users onto it without their
knowledge or consent.
And Tor tries to minimize any negative effects on the larger public from people
who didn't consent to using it, even though it has no duty to them--for example,
by voluntarily publishing the list of exit relays.

Sorry. *makes hand gesture of accidentally being in violent agreement*
I see; thank you, that's an important and valuable distinction (that
it's about the institution receiving federal funding in general, not
in specific for the one project, and that corporations not directly
engaged in medical research aren't subject to it). And I agree, it
would be very good to broaden which entities fall under the Common
Rule. For example, I think the role of U.S. consultancies working on
behalf of USAID and the State Department during the "loans for shares"
fiasco in Russia in the early '90s would've benefited from some
outside-the-echo-chamber review, though I'm not sure the economic
malpractice would've been prevented.
And of course if you take the "military cyberweapon" view of Tor that
e.g. Pando promulgates, then the appropriate review would be the U.S.
