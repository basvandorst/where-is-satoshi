@_subject: Different fingerprint problem 
As i made an upgrade (because of the high processor usage together with trickled) from tor version debian-0.1.0.15-1 to 0.1.1.8-alpha-cvs i think i forget at the first start from the alpha to import the original fingerprint from the debian version, because i get the error message: [warn] connection_dir_client_reached_eof(): http status 400("Rejected: There is already a verified server with this nickname and a different fingerprint.") response from dirserver '86.59.5.130:80'. Please correct. A subsequent import of the fingerprint produces two servers with the same name but different fingerprints at the router-status at  and always the error message from above.
Don't find a solution in the archives so is there a way to fix it on my server-side?
