@_subject: Problem with DLL 
Hi there,
here's a TOR problem report ....
after installing some new software, TOR refuses tor start with a message reading
"Die Ordnungszahl 3212 wurde in der DLL "LIBEAY32.dll" nicht gefunden."
the translation to english would read
"The ordinal number 3212 could not be found in LIBEAY32.DLL".
The problem is persistent with both TOR 0.0.8.1 and TOR 0.0.9pre4 (Win executable).
Any hint ?

@_subject: I'm seeing someone else's localhost.localdomain 
Hi Martin,
I can confirm that, too - unsing ' I got a page
which looks like it belongs to an ip address space of a japanese provider.
I havn't tried it more than twice, but I ended up on that page in both attepts.
My hosts file contains only localhost and 2 local PCs.
Best regards

Hi Adam, (and anybody involved in tor development)
... wouldn't it be nice to change the default behaviour of tor to avoid that,
or - at least - make the problem more public in the documentation ?
Best regards

@_subject: POP3 Traffic via TOR possible ? 
Hello there,
I'm just curious if it is possible to do POP3 requests via TOR ?
Any hint ?

@_subject: Mozilla Thunderbird leaking ? 
Ooops - looks like my build (20050317) is somewhat outdated.
BTW: In that build the sotware update feature told me that no
new update is available ( ... today ! ).
[short update & test break]
I've just updated to 1.0.6 (20050716), which looks like having the same problem - even while Thunderbird is configured to
use TOR/Privoxy (and most of the communication looks
encrypted) I capture DNS requests about the used NNTP server
circumventing TOR and Privoxy.

Yes,  giving thunderbird the IP would circumvent that problem, because there's no DNS entry to resolve.
I think there's a need to mention that on the TOR web site, isn't it ?
In the meanwhile I've filed a bug report on bugzilla ....

@_subject: Mozilla Thunderbird leaking ? 
Hi there,
since Mozilla Thunderbird (the news/rss/email client) supports the use of a proxy, I've tried to duplicate the TOR/PRIVOXY settings there and (curious as I am) I monitored the traffic with Ethereal.
While Mozilla Firefox seems to work fine with TOR - means:  as far as I can see nothing of my communication is in clear text - Thunderbird seems to leak DNS requests which are bypassig TOR / Privoxy.
Any confirmation / hint / tip / comment / etc. ?

Hi Scott,
How about making a tooltip ?
The statusbar may contain some icon (i.e. Onion / Onion with crossbars) to
save as much space as possible. The most current settings (TOR status, proxy
settings, whatever) would be shown in a tooltip.
