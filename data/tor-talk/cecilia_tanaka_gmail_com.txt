Cari, repeating again, in another mailing list:
-  Please, everybody deserves respect.  Every person in this world deserves
respect and consideration.
You don't know exactly what happened, so please stop to offend Jacob and
other persons.

Well, I don't know anything, my dear.  :-)
Reading your always lovely messages in the cypherpunks mailing list, I am
almost sure you probably know nothing about the real facts.
Your reaction, months ago, when Jacob's name was mentioned was very
disproportionate.  So, if you don't like him, you will create your own
personal truth, following your convictions.  For you, Jake is already
guilty, being innocent or not.  It is unfair.
Nobody knows exactly what happened and it is not correct to judge someone
without knowing more details and the real facts.
Sorry for being deeply sincere, but you like a lot to offend everybody in
your messages and it is unnecessary to express your feelings and ideas...
I said it before, do you remember?  :((
Jake, "victims" (or not), their friends and family, Tor Project team...
Everybody is too stressed and sad, feeling really bad about everything,
Cari.  Probably, you too.  So, you know that aggressive words just will
hurt everybody even more...  Sorry, it is not a constructive posture.
I am really upset and confused, but I won't judge anybody without more
details and facts.
Take care.  Ah, and sorry for my bad English!  I know it stinks more than
old cheese, hihi...  ;)

Sorry, we don't know if something happened or not, if Jake did something or
Some of my personal friends hate Jacob.  Jake is not my best friend, we are
not really close, but yes, he is my friend and my heart is with him in this
moment, because I already know Jake enough to have absolute conviction that
something is terribly "strange" and doesn't sound like "true".
I respect Shari Steele and her work.  I respect Tor Project core team and
voluntary collaborators in whole world.  We all want a better world for
everybody and each one of us work hard for it.  Maybe with different
personal beliefs, with different backgrounds, life histories and areas of
work, but we want a better world, less unfair and sad.
Sorry, it is *not* correct at all to judge a person without defense, in a
coward and cruel way.  It's pretty disgusting and unfair.  It's brutal.
Really sorry if my personal convictions offend someone here, but I know how
easy is to destroy a reputation, years of hard work, a whole life...
Nobody deserves to be hurted and humiliated until losing the faith in
humanity and in Justice.  We saw it happening several times before.  Human
History is full of sad examples.
Please, be careful before accusing someone.  Every single person in this
world deserves respect and has own value.
With tears and sincere and deep hope,

My dear,
Sorry, I can't believe in someone who is using Jake's own name for posting
anonimously articles offending him, his reputation and his work.
You want to humiliate him.  It is being a public lynching, real moral
Sorry, you are not being a victim.  Now, in this exact moment, you are
acting just exactly like the people you said that were wrong and it is
really disgusting.

Until I know  - and I know almost nothing, sorry! -  Tor doesn't block

"Google is not doing anything intentionally specifically to deter or block

He really "disappeared" for some years.  His last message in my personal

Yesterday, after reading that post about Nick Farr, I cried a lot and spent
a considerable time making searches in my archives.  It was pretty sad for
several personal reasons.
Well, I am worried about Nick too.  And, yes, it can sounds strange for
some people here, but I am praying for him too.  A lot...  :(
I don't know if his name is just being used for someone or not, if he is
alive or not, what happened or not, what is happening or not, but he is not
the kind of guy who would post something using Jake's name here.
Even being hurted and feeling pain, Nick probably would use his own name.

the pervert and Jake, the sociopath, because he is much more intelligent

There are some stories about me that only he will remember.  One of our

Cari, I was raped twice.  Different guys, different countries, several
years between an event and other.
I am a small cute girl, even acting like an old grumpy lady.  Both were
much bigger than me.  I have some sad scars.  One of them burned my body
with cigarretes.  I was a teenager.  My tattoos hide part of my scars.
The second rape was pretty disturbing because he was my friend and I was
sleeping.  This guy has his own scars and traums now.  I have lovely long
nails and I am not exactly a good person when defending my family and
Usually, I don't care so much about myself, but I was deeply in love with
the sweetest man in the world and, in that moment, I remember I just wanted
to live enough to tell him about my feelings.  So I did everything I could
to survive.
I am still alive.  I still love the sweetest man in the world, but now he
doesn't love me anymore.  It hurts much more than be raped, I swear.
Well, just told you part of my past, because I know very well what means
being a victim and feel despair.  I know, in a very intense and deep way,
what means to feel psychological and physical pain.  Believe me, I had
lovely experiences about harassment in different levels too.  I tried
suicide once, some months ago, because I just wanted to stop the pain.  I
just wanted to sleep again.
After these experiences, I didn't learn how to hate men or cigarretes.  I
learned why I need to hate lies.
PS:  -  Sorry, I crying a lot and my English probably is a shame, but if I
try to correct the mistakes, I am sure I won't send this message anymore.

Hi, my dear df!  :*
Some days ago, I sent a long message in an open list.  It was written in
(Brazilian) Portuguese.  It is a little excerpt of my letter:
"Ao contr?rio de alguns aqui, n?o pretendo ser injusta, nem assediar,
humilhar e ofender ningu?m, muito menos pelas costas.  Realmente n?o sei se
reencarna??o existe ou n?o, mas, na d?vida, quero evitar karma negativo.
Se h? indiv?duos aqui que n?o quero na minha vida presente, quanto mais em

Try to translate it, please.  I swear you will smile sincerely and
understand me much better, haha!!  ;D
I was talking seriously about "educational purposes".  I promise for
everything I believe that I won't stalk that people in a bad way!  :)
An example:  -  One of the guys is Brazilian and wrote me some bad words.
Really bad words because were written with terrible Grammar mistakes.  It
was several times more frustrating, aff...  :(((
I swear I read that message and thought:  -  "Ok if he wants to offend me,
but he could write these bad words correctly, at least, uff..."  :(((
I will teach a guy how to write some bad words correctly and why he must
not use them, haha!!  It will be scary enough for him, believe me, haha!!

always take care and be well.  The world needs your sweetness!  :*

My dear ja.talk,
The most sad about this kind of stories of abuse and rape is having
absolute conviction that some of Jake's "victims" are much more pervert,
rapist and hypocrite than Jake, me and great part of people here.
Once, some years ago, I was so innocent and fool as Jake and told about a
threesome experience in my loved hackerspace, full of my dear friends.
I really liked my threesome experience and, being ingenuous, I just tried
to share some impressions about it.  I thought it would be fun for them too.
Well, after this event, I am considered "pervert" until nowadays in great
part of Brazilian hacker community, even being straight edge.  Almost
straight edge, in reality.  I am not feeling so vegan since I saw a
ridiculous situation in person.
Some people are able to feed all the stray cats and dogs of the city and
don't give a kind word to another human being, because is a homeless.
Human beings are animals too.  They need respect and care too.
The same thing that I saw here.  Hypocrisy and contradictions, absence of
logic and respect, incoerences...  Aff...  :(((
Dear ja.talk, please, get a life, your own life, instead taking Jake's.  It
is not so hard.  If you do need help to survive in a better and less
painful way  -  without kill my friends or their reputations and/or mine,
please!  -  just write me in private and ask for good references  (music,
cooking recipes, jokes, etc)  and good readings.
Please, consider *really seriously* some kind of psychological treatment
too.  It is not healthy, neither normal, trying to destroy a person with so
much fury and rage.  And, please, always remember:
**  Talking is cheap.  Show me the code.  **
Jake is not a saint, but he, definitely, is not a monster.  He never was a
monster.  Sorry, why so much hate?  :-/
If you cannot proof or don't want to talk pretty seriously in a tribunal
about all the aleged abuses, Tor Project will pay for your legal mistakes.
Do you know what lawyers usually do in USA?  The same thing that you are
doing here.  They destroy lives, my dear ja.talk.
For now, Tor Project is still alive and working, more or less, well.  After
some public scandals and paying great indenizations, I doubt a lot.  Is it
your real purpose?  Destroy lives and security projects?  Please, think
about it with open mind and open heart.
Take care and be well, ja.talk group.  Warm and sincere wishes of inner
peace, harmony and hope for you all.  I always survived because I had true
hope in a better future, maybe not for me, but for the rest of the world.
I still dream of a better world.
Survive without destroy people around, please.  First, Jake.  Now Roger
too?  When will the public lynching stop?  Always without clemency,
compassion?  :(
Do you know what is love?  What do you feel when see someone crying?  Do
you have a heart?  Mine is broken, but never will be cruel as yours.  I
prefer to kill myself all the days than becoming so cruel and coward as you
are being right now.

All the times when I read your posts, I think  "Oh, I need to study German

"Milchreis" pretty well, but everybody thinks I am sneezing when I say
"Entschuldigung", haha!!  ;)

whenever he visits you ;-) you can tune the volume up accordingly to your
neighborhood. at the end of the tape: the screams you heard doesn't
necessarily have a correlation to the skill or action of my partner. (it
doesn't even necessarily indicate that someone has finished.)
Hahaha!!!  I was just joking, haha!!  ;D
Two years ago, I had a bizarre couple of neighbours and she was pretty
younger than he, an old rich man.  So, all the times when they were having
any sexual relation, she always was screaming extremely loud  - because he
was almost deaf! -  that my neighbours' bizarre sounds became inspiration
for a crazy project of mine at hackerspace, with the help of some
engineers, haha!!  ;D
I was so terribly stressed with all those f*cking sounds  - f* sounds in
both senses, haha!! -  that, in a long stressing night, when I was
finishing a pretty hard work, and she screamed much louder than my music, I
had a kind of comical revenge...  :B
When she screamed "I am feeling so hot, I am burning, I am in fire!!!", I
screamed "Help, help!!!  Call the firefighters!!!  She is dying!!!".  All
the stressed  neighbourhood laughed a lot for a long time, and, two days
after it, the noisy couple moved to another place and I never used my
project, haha!!  ;)
Empty words, stupid labels, lynching people without proofs...  Maybe dying
of sadness soon, in this Sunday, will be better than waiting more for the
future...  I always had hope and believed in a better world, but,
sometimes, I feel so much fear of being wrong and living just for seeing a
more miserable and sad world, my dear...  My heart is already broken.  My
death will be pure despair if I live just for seeing my dreams becoming an
even worse nightmare...  :'(
Well, I will pray for a better world and will try to do my part.  Let's
cross our fingers and have hope in a better future for all the people, my
dear!  :*
Warm hugs!  Have a good night and sweet dreams!  :*
PS:  -  I do need to study English.  All the times when I try to write
"whether", I don't know why, I write "weather"!  Instead, I am using "if"
as a crazy, haha!!  ;)

I won't say anything about this hypocrite statment because I love, respect
and admire sincerely some of their founders, ex-members and members.  I
certainly would die for some of them right now, if necessary, and I will
loyal to them until the last of my days.
Knowing some people's level of "excellence" there, I am sure that my

be a way of protecting them.
Well, "be excellent to each other", Noisebridgers!  Hope they remember that

---------- Forwarded message ----------
     I subxcribe to the Noisebridge-announce mailing

sent to the Noisebridge-announce list. Here is the
entire content of the body of the message:
Below is my reply to the message:
    This is coming out of the blue for me. I have
heard no claims against Jake for any reason.
    My questions are
* who wrote this
* what is the basis of the claims against Jake?
   The anonymity of the writer makes me suspicious.
   The lack of information behind the primary claim
makes me suspicious.
   This may be an artifact of a smear campaign.
   I'm presenting my concern to the Noisebridge-discuss
mailing list hoping for information. I really hope
this does not develop into an emotional discussion.

Oh, it is so lovely!  The world is really small, as I said times before!  <3
Joana Varon  (not Veron)  is a lovely friend of mine and we both work
voluntarily in different groups for *women's empowerment* using technology
in general.
I am a bad lawyer and tell lots of bad jokes, but Joana is a famous
researcher, famous for her intelligence and her work in the privacy area.
I didn't know about this statement, because I am being harassed for several
"friends" of mine and, just in case, I avoiding contact with everybody.  :P
Now, my day is much more beautiful and I think I love her even more,
haha!!  ;)
I bcc her in this message and  -  wow!  -  Jo, I do love you!  Thank you
for being so fair and rational in all the moments.  You are an awesome
professional and a gorgeous person.  Thank you for being, my dear!  :*
Have a lovely weekend, shiny happy people!  <3

Sorry, my dear ja.talk, I will read everything you posted a bit later,
because now I am busy, helping some friends to get blankets and hot clothes
to homeless people.  If you want to help, we all will thank you sincerely!
Brazilian Winter will begin in the next week, but the weather is really
cold and people are dying with hypothermia in the streets.  Some of them
because are deeply loyal to their friends.  They don't want to leave their
dogs alone in the cold night and simply die...  :'(
Sorry for being more worried with anonymous people dying outside instead
with Jake, you and all these statments.  All of you have blankets and hot
clothes and won't die of hypothermia tonight.  Jake already knows that my
priority is much bigger than personal revenges.
Oh, ja.talk, please, say "thank you" to the person who said that will rape
me, because I like rapists!  I almost don't use that old riseup account and
few people know it.  I am (almost) sure that was a Noisebridger, a woman
faking to be a man.  Please, it was pretty coward and stupid!  :P
Get a life and donate blankets, blood, hair, services, etc, please.  I need
to get time enough to donate my hair to children with cancer.  It's pretty
longer than usual now and it will be two cute wigs.  I will take a pic
before and after cutting it, so you can follow the example or make some
voodoo, if you prefer.  ;)
We have several projects in my country to give some joy to children.  I
know that revenge is a personal project of yours, but you can do much more
for people.  Learn it, please, and share some love instead hate.
I've sent this message to some friends of mine yesterday, at afternoon,
before NB meeting.  Homework, my dear!  Translate it and, please, ask to NB
people to register all they said at meeting about CCC and DEFCON and lots
of events and hackerspaces publicly.  Everybody will be proud of the
highest patterns of the most important hacker community in the whole
world!  North-American ego trips are always pretty funny, hihi!  ;)

Please, if you have T-shirts to donate, I will sincerely thank you for the
rest of my life.  Sorry, we have almost no money to help all the homeless
people and I am trying to get some food and hot drinks now, but I can give
addresses to donations of your T-shirts.
Please, don't make jokes with it.  Who saves a single life, can save the
whole world.  We do need a better world for everybody.  A world where
nobody will accept and be happy with the death of innocent people:
Sorry, I love Jake, Nick Farr, Violet Blue, a lot of persons mentioned in
last days, but I think that world is much bigger than these statments and
tweets.  I promise I will read all of them with sincere care and attention
later, but now I really have other priorities.

Hi Robert!
Sorry, it was a little bit harsh in this specific case, because I was
sincerely asking for donations of clothes for poor homeless people.
You can make searches in Brazilian newspapers and news sites, if you don't
believe in me.  A North-American guy thought I was joking because "Brazil
is a tropycal country", aff...  :(((
I am tired of being hated just for being Jake's friend and I am tired of
being loved just for being Jake's friend, my dear.  I am much more than his
friend and I need a little of time just for follow my own dreams of a
better world or I will die in a cold world exactly like all these homeless
people, Robert.
Sorry if I upset you.  I apologize for it.  I am a little blue now, but not
because I am sad.  I think cold water made my fingers completely blue,
ugh!  o.O
I love the blue color, but not in this way!  :(((
Warm hugs, take care!  :*

Meh, too childish...  It's becoming pretty boring!  :-/
Maybe a man can't see it, but even the most stupid woman in the world can
notice an evident *lie* in the last statment published.
The obvious efforts trying to adjust the accusations to being more
realistic and plausible, giving also more colours and emotions, are pretty
interesting.  I like it!  ;)
I didn't stop to search for some trustworthy information and for more
references in last days.
A programmer (woman) told me some 'juicy gossip' about one of alleged
victims, but it would be pretty disgusting to tell it here.  Ugh!  :-/
Well, in thesis, one of alleged victims is being hypocrite and hates
Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.
Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/
I always says my friend is a 'feminazi' who hates all the men and she knows
about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D
Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P
Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D
She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)
Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P
Warm hugs and tender kisses!!!  Ah, thank you everybody!!!  I received some
lovely messages about helping homeless people and two donations, yay!!!  ;D
(No Tor t-shirts, but some hot blankets!  <3 )

Hi,   :)
Please, try to relax a bit.  Trolls, bad trolls everywhere...  but it's
Saturday night now!  Let's have some fun, yay!  :D
When possible, read the mini-series 'The Books of Magic', by Neil Gaiman.
Comic books, four amazing issues.  Timothy Hunter will be the world's
greatest magician and his journey is gorgeous.
If you never read 'Sandman', please, try it.  Dreams and dreamers, hopes
and horror, Shakespeare and old forgotten gods, Joseph Campbel and Freud
playing with fairies in secret gardens inside your soul...  and, of corse,
magic!  :D
Astonishing beauty.  Neil Gaiman created a whole new universe using poetry,
music, legends and already existent people and characters.  Lots of
interesting references.
If you are a skeptical guy, probably will love John Constantine stories
too.  The movie was a disaster, even having Keanu Reeves as Constantine,
but he is an awesome character, complex and pretty human.  Not exactly a
good human, but always a great magician, hihi...  ;)
The world is becoming pretty boring.  Life is about finding magic, music
and poetry in our days.  :)
I am really too exhausted to write now about the last statments and
answering to _serious_ messages, private or not, but I think 'cheesy
dramatic music' will be a better soundtrack for us than rock in this
moment, my dear (To who knows me in person, it is *not* one of my fun protests, haha!!  :D
When I am censored, I always send lyrics, cooking recipes, jokes and comics
to protest, because I am frequently associated with these themes, hahaha!!
  I gave you opera and you gave me rock.  So, please, search
for 'Teach Your Children'  (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)  lyrics.  Maybe
you don't like the music  (folk rock),  but will love the lyrics.  Please,
search for 'The Ballad Of The Sad Young Men'  (Wolf/Landesman)  lyrics
too.  Lots of singers, but I prefer Renato Russo version, because he was
pretty important for me.
 don't worry so much about  feelings.  All the times after
receiving a cruel or stupid message, he will write for me instead the
list.  He will get bad feelings out and I will learn a lot of new bad words
and bad expressions.  He always will laugh and feel better after it,
hahaha!!!  ;D
Argentina and Brazil are rivals in everything, so we always have pretty
serious discussions about several things.  It's obvious that the Brazilian
politicians are more corrupt and more stupid, but he wants to prove me that
they have worse politicians than us.  Pretentious Juan, hunfs!  ;P
Hahaha!!  Lovely weekend for all!!  :D

Hi,   I really appreciated a lot your thoughts and thank
you sincerely for sharing your considerations.  Muah!  :*
 last night, I was writing a really long text about all the last
chapters of this soap opera, but I am really exhausted in all possible
One of my best friends is living his personal hell and he and his wife are
f*cking depressed.  His mother is at hospital, dying with a terminal
cancer.  His daughter also has a brutal cancer and we are trying to make
everything easier for his 2 years old grandson.
I am pretending to be happy when I just want to cry and I am trying to
teach him how to play Angry Birds and a little bit of scratch.  I tried
books and drawing, but he just wants to use the tablet.  Tech generation,
hihi...  ;)
It's a sad coincidence.  The last time I saw Jake in person, I was seated
on the hackerspace floor, also playing with a little boy using a tablet.
Well...  As I said before, I love Violet Blue.  She is gorgeous, an amazing
woman in several senses, much more intelligent and smarter than the whole
ja.talk group and all the haters here together.  She knows the perfection
lives in little details.
I respect her a lot, but I don't trust her for several reasons.  I won't
decline here all my reasons because I don't want to expose her and some of
her (ex) lovers.
Sorry, she is a predator, not a victim.  She is pretty dangerous because
she is fascinating and she knows it.
Some *men* wrote to me poiting the evident lies in the statment and I
didn't answer to none of them, because I don't know those contacts and I
don't want the ja.group try to adequate the statments again.  It is pretty
interesting what they are doing to get more credibility and to make the
statments more reliable.  Even a blind lawyer can see it.
Yesterday, in another sad coincidence, I told to my best friend that Tor
Project stories are a kind of soap opera, Mirimir.  A bad one, ugh!  :(
Well, tonight, instead thinking about statments and trials, I will learn
more about Orange Pi.  A guy wrote me a long letter about his problems
using Orange Pi.  I answered something like "Oh, so sorry, my dear, I just
know a bit of Raspberry Pi and never tried Banana Pi and Orange Pi yet".
He is just a little boy and said that "the people in the hackerspace have
no patience with me and I am too shy to ask to Well, my best friend is f*cking intelligent and has a generous and kind
heart, but his heart is really well hidden in some place behind his bad
mood and his angry face, hahaha!!  So, let's learn more about Orange Pi,
haha!!  ;D
(Uff, I left the hackerspace, but the hackerspace didn't left me yet...)
