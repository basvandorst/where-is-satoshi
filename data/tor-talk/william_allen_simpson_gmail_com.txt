As well you could be, because you appear to have the same name as a
registered sex offender:
   # As a long time service provider ...
# my many years of experience in engineering ARPANET, MILNET, and the
# Internet I would have to guess that most Tor servers are used for no
# good much more than they are protecting anyone's privacy.
I'm surprised that medline.com is offering network access as an ISP?
Admittedly, you began posting to NANOG in 2002 as:
   Network Engineering Manager
   Hosting.com - Chicago
While I was involved in engineering NSFnet and the Internet and was an
"original" member of NANOG, but I don't remember you.  Of course, I'm
notoriously bad with names.
OTOH, I have met, remember, and greatly respect the Tor engineers.
