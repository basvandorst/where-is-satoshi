@_subject: Gsoc Idea: Lunux Tor/Firefox Bundle 
I am interested in taking up the challange of creating the Tor/Firefox
bundle for Linux. I am knowledgeable in C++, with some familiarity in C and
Bash scripting, and I am most familiar with Ubuntu Linux. I am not well
versed in the development of Tor, but I intend to learn. I was thinking that
the bundle should be in both source and binary form with potentially some
distribution-specific packaging. There should also be a portable package
much like the existing Windows bundle.
I appreaciate feedback to enable me to create a full proposal. Thankyou in
advance for your Help.

I wasn't originally considering packaging with a full distribution, but
doing so would be beneficial. Both an emulated enviroinment and live CD
should probably be produced.
