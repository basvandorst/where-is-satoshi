Hey guys,
I am doing a small research about the Tor Network at my local
university, and I wonder if anyone could recommend good
articles/journals, about the Tor Network. I have found a few on the
internet, but perhaps there are a few "must read" papers.
I am interrested in the following topics;
- The Tor Network encryption
- A analysis of the Tor Network (Packets, internal security and etc)
- Real world use
Thanks for the great tool.
