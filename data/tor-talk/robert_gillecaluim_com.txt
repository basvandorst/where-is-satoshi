@_subject: [tor-talk] iptables rules 
could someone please clarify a question I have about configuring tor &
iptables.  I'm using a dual nic centos server with squid/privoxy/tor behind
a ISP router.  My internet nic (eth0) gets a dhcp address so I wasn't sure
how to set SocksBindAddress to the eth0 address?  Is there a
SocksBindAdapter setting available?
My tor.conf:
*SocksPort 9150   socks5 port*
*SocksBindAddress 127.0.0.1*
*SocksPolicy accept 127.0.0.1*
*SocksPolicy reject **
*AllowUnverifiedNodes middle,rendezvous*
*Log notice syslog*
*RunAsDaemon 1*
*User tor*
*CircuitBuildTimeout 30*
*NumEntryGuards 6*
*KeepalivePeriod 60*
*NewCircuitPeriod 15*
*DataDirectory /var/lib/tor*
*PidFile /var/run/tor/tor.pid*
*Log notice file /var/log/tor/tor.log*
I was thinking I would have to forward eth0:9050 to lo:9050 with these
*-A FORWARD -i lo -o eth0 -p tcp --dport 9050  -j ACCEPT*
*-A FORWARD -i eth0 -o lo -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT*
Any advice would be appreciated.

Setting up tor relay on verizon fios and not sure what, if anything I can
do about DNS error in log....
*Oct 21 20:38:14.000 [notice] Self-testing indicates your DirPort is
reachable from the outside. Excellent.*
*Oct 21 20:38:15.000 [notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is
reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.*
*Oct 21 20:38:22.000 [notice] Performing bandwidth self-test...done.*
*Oct 21 20:40:03.000 [notice] Your DNS provider gave an answer for
"elrnjy6c.invalid", which is not supposed to exist. Apparently they are
hijacking DNS failures. Trying to correct for this. We've noticed 1
possibly bad address so far.*
*Oct 21 20:40:03.000 [notice] Your DNS provider has given "92.242.140.21"
as an answer for 10 different invalid addresses. Apparently they are
hijacking DNS failures. I'll try to correct for this by treating future
occurrences of "92.242.140.21" as 'not found'.*
I looked at the verizon router settings and can't set the dns servers
directly.  Can I ignore this notice?
Will I be able to forward dns queries via tor, or is that a different issue

I've established a tor relay on a headless centos server.  How can I log
the traffic coming through either via a log or a command line query?

@_subject: [tor-talk] using squid/privoxy/tor 
I'm using a centos6.5 server as a gateway/router and have seen several web
posts about setting up a squid/privoxy/tor gateway.  Still trying to get my
head wrapped around the anonymity details but have a simple question.
would the users on the intranet which funnel their http request through the
squid/privoxy/tor gateway still need to use a tor browser or does the setup
obviate the need for a custom browser setup?
also could someone point me to a tutorial on anonymizing dns ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] foxnews blockade 
I've configured a squid/privoxy/tor setup and have been testing.  I'm
unable to visit  ....Access Denied but foxnews isn't listed
in the ListofServicesBlockingTor.  Is this just me and a misconfigured
setup or are other people getting the same problem
