good day, im an avid user and serious advocate of this community for
years now but im totally not technically inclined.
lately im trying to run a node at my place but apparently my isp
connection is not that stable enough so i thought of getting a vps
from a hosting provider.
could anyone from the community able to help me set it up a node using
a vps provider? as i said im not technically savvy person. not only
setting it up but making sure the nodes data and specially logs are
secured and in accessible by anyone.
this could be my small way of contribution to this good community,
running an exit node.

thanks for the replies, that's totally true it's certain that they
will give me that "bait and switch" treatment. the reason im getting
that cheap vps is some sort of a learning environment. im totally
starting from scratch here, knowing nothing from vps to unix. so im
not losing that much with a cheap vps if every thing goes down every
now and then.
but as soon as i successfully install and run exit node and specially
how to secure those datas/logs out from the reach of everyone then i
will move immediately to a more expensive vps.
hoping while im still learning somehow someone have the patience to guide me.

it's up and running now. i followed this
but my problem is it never got the "EXIT" status.
what could be the problem? i used the same torrc config at home and my
home node read as both VALID and EXIT
i also noticed in the logs this DNS hijacking warning.

with his kind of exit policy, what exactly the type/kind of node is that?
and it thought if i calculate the RelayBandwidthRate below it's
AccountingMax i will never go into hibernation.

for me it seems the graph is fine. though the node so seldom hits
beyond 80000bps
before i experienced a flat line for several days. i didn't go below
my max speed for several days. a literal flat line to the max for
about 2-3 days.
