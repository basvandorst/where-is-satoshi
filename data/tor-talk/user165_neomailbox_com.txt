@_subject: getting tor to start at boot on mac osx 
I've used osx a total of about 4 hours now, and have got the tor/ privoxy package installed.  I've set it up as a server and it works  great, but it doesn't seem to start up at boot time.  Did I miss  something in the setup?  Tor and Privoxy are listed in the /Library/ StartupItems folder.
When I do a shutdown -r now, I see that Privoxy tries to start at  that time, and notices that something is already listening on 8118 -  I see that privoxy is running as root at bootup, but no tor - running  the "tor start" command in /Library/StartupItems does start tor  running as _tor.

relating to tor.  I'm kind of new to this osx (and unix) stuff.
Here's a snippet of the system.log around where I see the privoxy start:

Yes, starts up with no problems.

I'm getting the following message about once an hour when I run  0.1.1.21 on a windows server 2003 machine:
Jun 28 01:11:08.173 [warn] resolve_my_address(): Could not resolve  local Address 'hyperion.selfip.net'. Failing.

Running the same version (same configuration) on darwin i386, I don't  get the message.  The DNS server that both are looking at is on the  server 2003 machine.  Even with this error, everything seems to be  working fine - the tor dir servers show it as up the entire time, it  seems to have traffic flowing through it, the dns server is working  ok, nat is set up correctly.  the server is elysium.

it resolves here, also.  I've tried other dns servers for the server  os to use, it seems to be either tor or the os.  I thought maybe it  was related to what roger was talking about re: 0.1.1.20, but I don't  have the other symptoms, plus my ip, though dynamic, never changes  unless I force a change by changing my MAC address...

I was wondering if anyone else running on a windoze server machine  was having the same problem.  As I said, if I switch my tor server to  run on my mac, under darwin i386, I don't have the problem.  I was  incorrect when I said that the dir servers say I'm up all the time,  on closer examination, it seems that my uptime "sometimes" coincides  with one of these error messages, but not always.  My next step is to  just reinstall the os and see if that fixes it.

@_subject: China's Google Blockage 
From  , today:
China 'blocks' main Google site
Chinese authorities have blocked most domestic users from the main  Google.com search engine, a media watchdog said.
Internet users in major Chinese cities faced difficulties accessing  Google's international site in the past week, Reporters Without  Borders said.
But Google.cn, the controversial Chinese language version launched in  January, has not been affected.
The site blocks politically sensitive material to comply with  government censorship rules.
"It was only to be expected that Google.com would be gradually  sidelined after the censored version was launched in January,"  Reporters Without Borders said in a statement.
"Google has just definitively joined the club of Western companies  that comply with online censorship in China," the organisation said.
Google.com, the search engine's uncensored international site, had  previously been available to Chinese web users, but problems  accessing the site had been reported across the country recently. It  was blocked nationwide on 31 May, the statement said.
The blocking was also being extended to Google News and Google Mail,  Reporters Without Borders said.
'Principled approach'
A spokeswoman for Goggle in Beijing said that the problem was under  The spokeswoman, Cui Jin, said she could not give any more information.
On Tuesday, Google co-founder Sergey Brin defended his company's  decision to launch the censored Google.cn service, a move which drew  heavy criticism.
"We felt that perhaps we could compromise our principles but provide  ultimately more information for the Chinese and be a more effective  service," he said.
"Perhaps now the principled approach makes more sense."
In addition to Google, US companies Microsoft, Yahoo and Cisco  Systems have also been accused of accommodating China's demands on  censorship in return for access to its huge internet market.
The Chinese government's internet filtering is some of the most  sophisticated in the world.
Content considered to be a threat, including references to the  Tiananmen Square massacre and notable dissidents, is blocked.
Chinese authorities have also stepped up measures against software  designed to bypass internet censorship, the Reporters Without Borders  statement said.

Are you looking for data only from servers that have a problem  starting in the first place AND don't handle ip addresses changes  well?  Or would you also like logs from servers that start up well  but also don't handle ip address changes very well?

whoever (or whatever) providing the block lists, then the owner would  be in a much worse position because there could be a claim that he  didn't do all that was possible to disallow the use of his exit node  for nefarious purposes.  Once you say that you are going to provide  that level of "protection" (i don't agree that it is protection, or  even a morally good thing to try and do), then you become liable for  the failure of that protection.
SHOULDN'T.  (REALLY!)
that ip ranges and addresses can be entered in the ExitPolicy - I  would rather just see the private nets blocked automatically.  (I do  understand why they are there, and understand their necessity in  private tor nets, though).  I don't like the RedirectExit parameter  either (but I understand the reason, just the same).  When you start  using exit filters for whatever reason, however "good" you think the  reason is, it allows someone else to use it for a reason that you  won't consider "good".
Appeasement has been tried before, and usually doesn't get the  desired result, just ask Neville Chamberlain...

I don't think that deciding which ports to allow has anything to do  with censorship.  Censorship refers to content, not method.

I guess I would like to prevent censorship on tor, you're right.  I  would prefer it if exit nodes operators were prevented from any sort  blocking based on source, destination or content, and have  SafeLogging hardcoded to true in release versions.  I would like the  C, I, and A, as well as anonymity to be unquestioned with regards to  tor.  There are other ways to get information about the connections,  but it would be nice to say that you cannot get that information or  perform any sort of censorship or compromising of the integrity of  data sent through or availability of any destination on the internet  using tor itself.  I thought this was the whole point of tor.   It  should try to attain the same neutrality as a large backbone router,  at least as much as is possible.  I don't want to have to worry that  I'm actually connecting to the site I think I am.  That's why I don't  like RedirectExit .
