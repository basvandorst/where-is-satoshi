@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in the command line Linux 
I'm trying to control Tor from the command line in Tails.  I want Tor
to use bridges with obfs4.  I can't figure out the commands to type in
to have Tor use addresses I specify.  Any help is apreciated.
By the way the reason I don't just do it graphically is because I am
visually impaired so I figured the screen reader will read the command
line to me because the graphical way is inaccessable with Orca.

Yes Tor Browser works fine in Tails.  The problem is that the Tor Network settings screen does not work with Orca.  I was wondering how to tell Tor to use bridges through Terminal.  The reply I got last night was good, but bridges are not included in that file.  If anyone could give me the commands and an example that would be great.

I?ve been reading a paper that talks about why the NSA told everyone to move to quantum resistant crypto.  One of the ideas in the paper was that they may have broken elliptic curves.  I understand that they?re used in Tor.  Does anyone think that NSA actually has the capability to break ECC?

@_subject: [tor-talk] MITM attack on TLS 
I just learned that the IT department of an organization where I am
will begin mass decryption on TLS traffic.  Would this effect the use
of the Meek pluggable transport?  Just to give more information, the
attack will be done by having every network user install a root cert
in our browsers.  Any information is apreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] MITM attack on TLS 
The IT department does not have access to my machine.  Also, I have no option but to keep the cert because if I don?t the filter may use DPI to block TLS for me.  Not sure if that will be happening, but it may be possible.  When it comes to malware, if I think that the IT department is going after me, I will use Tails.  That should certainly stop them.

I think I will use OBFS4.  When it comes to the cert, I will probably have the option not to install it.  By the way if you want more security and you?re really in trouble you should Tails.

SSH is probably more dangerous than OBFS4 because it coulee be detected with a DPI fingerprint.  They might question that.  I think Tor with transports is good.

@_subject: [tor-talk] MITM attack on TLS 
I won?t get into trouble because I?m not using regular Tor.  I?m using pluggable transports, which hide the Tor traffic and make it unrecognizable to a DPI box.  This should be good enough even if Meek?s TLS is broken.

@_author: Justin 
@_subject: [tor-talk] MITM attack on TLS 
I know.  OBFS4 makes the traffic unrecognizable to a DPI unit.  That?s why I switched from Meek to it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] MITM attack on TLS 
You would be correct normally, but at school, I know the IT guy very well.  I have calculated that he is probably too lazy to check his logs.  He usually doesn?t check things out until someone tells him that a problem is occurring.  Even if Meek-Google is broken, I got more information from him that would indicate that he probably won?t MITM Meek-Amazon or Azure.  If it does become dangerous, I will switch to one of those.

@_date: 2015-11-21 17:43:15
@_author: Justin 
@_subject: [tor-talk] MITM attack on TLS 
If he does overcome his laziness, I?m ready to use another transport.  He has not deployed a cert.  I know this for a fact because the filter he?s using will prompt users to download it to their devices.  When it comes to storing traffic, I am pretty sure that Meek will stop connecting if it can?t verify the TLS connection.  When it comes to whether or not it matters, yes it does.  Because decrypting all traffic at the gateway slows down the Internet, so he?s going to have to decide what to decrypt.  My threat model assumes that Meek-Google will be broken.  It also assumes that the Amazon and Azure versions may be broken.  Should they all be broken, I will switch to another transport.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR and Obfsproxy packet size 
I?m not sure what the answer to your question about regular Tor is.  When it comes to Obfsproxy changing the 586 byte size, it?s to evade filters that use that to help block Tor.  The other packet length fluctuations would indicate that Obfsproxy makes the sizes of packets different so that it?s very difficult for a Deep packet inspection unit to fingerprint packet size and block Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Meek Problems 
When I connect to Tor at school without bridges, it works fine.  The issue is that my IT department has a DPI unit that can tell I?m using Tor, so I tried using Meek.  When Tor starts, it boot straps to 10%, then stops.  When I click Open Settings, it says Tor failed to establish an encrypted directory connection.  Somehow, Meek is being broken by the sensor.  I thought the sensor might be doing a man in the middle on Google, but when I load the web site, I don?t get any MITM warnings.  OBFS 3 and 4 and Scramblesuit work just fine, along with regular Tor.  My question to you guys is, what would the filter be doing to break Meek?
The funny thing is that I don?t think it?s breaking Meek on purpose.

Actually, you?re totally wrong.  According to a top secret NSA document, which you can view online:
Tor is the king of high secure, low latency anonymity.  No contender awaits the throne.
That would clearly indicate that you know absolutely nothing about Tor, Onion routing, or anonymity in general.  Hell, you probably don?t even know how to use the Internet since you?re just a little five year old having your stupid ass friend type your emails for you.  We Do Not want you in our community.  Fuck Off!

I actually figured out the problem a couple of days ago.  The sensor
is changing the Google.com URL to something odd that I think may
affect the TLS.  So instead of fronting  I told Tor
Browser to front gmail.com and it worked.
Thanks for the information,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Encryption and Bridges 
I was reading the second Tor design paper.  It said that Tor used AES-128 encryption (TLS).  Does Tor still use AES-128 or has it been upgraded to AES-256?  When it comes to bridges, let?s say I want to use a bridge in Orbot or Tails.  I can?t select what pluggable transport I want to use.  If I type in an OBFS4 address will Orbot/Tails know that it needs to connect to the bridge using OBFS4?
Thanks everyone,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Cyberoam is again blocking Meek 
I’ve been conducting some more tests against a Cyberoam with Meek, and over the past two weeks, they have managed to completely block the default front domains of Meek.  Meek-Azure gets blocked at 10% of Tor bootstrapping, so it’s probably being fingerprinted on the Firefox 45.2.0 ESR TLS signature.  Meek-Amazon gets stopped at 25% of bootstrapping, and I’m not sure what Cyberoam is fingerprinting.  Any ideas?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor protocol classification 
I’ve been interested in Tor censorship for a few years now, and had some questions.
1. Can anyone give me a description of what Tor is doing during the following stages of bootstrapping:
A. 10% Finishing handshake with directory server.  What happens during the handshake and what makes it fingerprintable by a DPI box?
B. 20% Asking for network status consensus.  Same questions as A.
C. 45% Asking for relay descriptors.
D. 85% Finishing handshake with first hop.
E. 90% Establishing a Tor circuit.
The reason I picked these stages of bootstrapping is because they’re the places where Tor is recognized and blocked by DPI equipment from Cyberoam.  Keep in mind this is Vanilla Tor, no PT are used.
Thanks very much,

You?re partially correct when you say don?t take the metrics as real users.  Some of them may be bots, but can you please give us a link to an article about those events that you discussed?  I really doubt that 1.5 million bots are using Tor everyday by the way.

From what I know, you’re correct.  The Chinese use a lot of people to get bridges, or maybe they created a bonnet that can do it for them, either way they’ve done exactly what you said.  They have managed to block the automated bridge distribution methods.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pluggable Transports and DPI 
I have a DPI box that I use to test pluggable transports with.  I also test other circumvention tools against it just to see how good it is.  Manufacturer is Cyberoam.  About 6 or 8 weeks ago, Cyberoam released a DPI engine update that could filter normal Tor and the following pluggable transports:
About a week ago, Cyberoam released another update to its application filter.  This update allows it to filter all Meek connections without doing a man in the middle on the TLS or anything.  When I try to load  , it loads fine in a normal Firefox.  When I use Meek, it fails and the Cyberoam logs a Tor Proxy attempt.  The only transport that still works is FTE.  I was talking with Arma on the Tor IRC channel a wile ago, and he suggested that I use Tcpreplay and send in a copy of what Cyberoam is fingerprinting.  I will have to wait a wile until I do this, because the school year hasn?t ended yet.  I?m sending out this message to alert Tor users of the new threat and also to see what some solutions may be, E.G new transports in the works.
Thanks, and stay safe.

@_author: Justin Davis 
@_subject: [tor-talk] obfs4 
I think I may have thought of how some DPI boxes are blocking obfs4
and other "look like nothing" transports.
I think the amount of users using a bridge will cause the packet
interarrival times to change significantly. For example, a bridge
under heavy load would have a slower response time, and maybe other
differences. A bridge under light load would have a quicker
interarrival time. So when a user tries to use obfs4, the middlebox
looks for packets with very high entropy, then matches those high
entropy packets with a timing signature of heavy load bridges. Other
filter companies that are smarter will also have a calculated value
for low use bridges, but some do not. If the filter company has not
considered that a low use bridge could have a different timing
signature, then those bridges will probably work. Maybe my idea isn't
quiet right, if anyone has improvements they are welcome.
