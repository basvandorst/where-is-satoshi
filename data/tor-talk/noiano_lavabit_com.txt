Is it possible to download that video? What about the slides?
As long as you know is there something written (ie some papers) that
recalls what Rogers discusses in the video?

@_subject: The pirate bay, torrent and TOR 
Hello everybody,
as you may know The Pirate Bay is being blocked in Italy for legal
issues. It's just a matter of time before all connection to all the TPB
servers will be blocked. Many people are suggesting to use tor+vidalia
in order to bypass the block. It's a good suggestion but, IMHO, people
care very little about just surfing thepiratebay.org. They want to
access the tracker and download ;-) .
Since I do not know the torrent protocol I wander: is it possible to use
tor as a "proxy" to access the tracker and get the data connections not
passing through tor? This would be possible if the request a client
makes to a tracker contains the non-tor ip of the client, I guess.
Any idea is welcome.
Noiano (from italy :-P  )

I had to deactivate spam check because they inject a link in order to
train their spam filter...it's like an advertisement. It's a great email
service, though ;-)

@_subject: PSI patch anti dns-leaking 
Hello everybody
some time ago I submitted a request through the psi flyspry bug tracking
system asking the devs to resolve the dns-leaking problem. Since the
devs seems not to have decided when to fix this bug a good gui, hannes,
has developed a patch that acts as a workaround for the problem. You can
download the patch from here
 . In
tor logs you won't see any message saying tor has been given an host to
resolve but I tested myself the patch sniffing the traffic by wireshark
and I found no dns request.

@_subject: TorStatus version 4 has been released 
In my *very humble opinion* I think the web page is a bit too heavy for
two reasons:
? it takes a bit too much to load because it contains a lot of data.
Perhaps it should be cut at some point and should be put something like
?show all exit nodes? especially because usually surfing through tor
isn't fast.
? it takes a bit too much to process the whole pages: Firefox freezes
for some moments...maybe for non-fast computer this can be a problem.
I am no web developer so, again, this comments are IMVHO.

As Ronger Dingledine said in a tor talk somewhere in germany "there are
a lots of stupid guys out there using tor". The stupid guys commit a lot
of abuses so, for example, wikipedia doesn't tor users to modify
anything in order to prevent abuses. Maybe digg.com does the same, I
don't know. You can try to change circuit by clicking "new identify" on
vidalia: if this works only the ip of the previous exit node was banned.
If it doesn't probably all tor exit nodes are banned.

@_subject: Tor-only email 
I've tried tormail. Thunderbird does connect to the remote server but an
error message is displayed: something like "an error has occurred.
Remote server answered: " and nothing more.
Has anyone the same problem? How do I manage it?

You'd better use some VPN service like IPREDator (info here
Tor is not suitable for P2P.
