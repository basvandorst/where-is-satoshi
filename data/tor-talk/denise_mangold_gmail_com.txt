@_subject: [tor-talk] UNIX Admin 
I'm just putting this out there.  I'm more than happy to help admin any
UNIX boxes for the TOR project.  I think TOR is valuable and anything I can
do to help I'm happy to.  I'm also pretty good at writing tech docs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] generating more donations 
I have my amazon smile to donate to the Tor project.  I think there should
be more marketing of this to generate more money/donations. I do see it in
the donate page, but I think more people would use the Amazon smile.  A lot
of people shop on amazon and support tor.
Also, I have an AWS that I really keep meaning to set up a relay on, I'll
get to it eventually, I promise.
