@_subject: [tor-talk] Download speed 
When I use the Tor Browser Bundle and will download a file my speed can reach 300 or 400 kb. I think something is wrong, because that is the speed of a normal connection. It is normal to download at a rate so high? Something is wrong?
OBS: Im from the latins and i use google translator. Forgive my poor english.
