@_subject: [tor-talk] proxy servers compatible with tor and proxychains 
After searching for free proxies, it has been difficult to find servers to add to the proxychains configuration file, to use with tor. Nearly all ip addresses deny access.
Is there a list of free proxy servers that are friendly to tor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor with vpn 
Can someone please explain if it is possible to use tor with a vpn? The reason is to overcome tor nodes being banned by certain service providers (in this example a blog host).
Ideally, would like to access via a command terminal, e.g.
torsocks [vpn] [command terminal program]
The hope is that the vpn ip address is seen by the service provider, not the tor node.
