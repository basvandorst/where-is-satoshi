@_subject: [tor-talk] Designing a secure "Tor box" for safe web browsing? 
I am sorry for that but I got limited resources for working on this project. The code for the gateway is now online and I am moving the whole project to github.[0] This is to some degree what I am implementing. Until deciding for a better name[1] I call the two parts "Tor gateway" and "Tor workstation". The gateway is still missing a few features[2] (and documentation especially) but it is out of a proof-of-concept-only state. (Whereas the "fast gateway" and workstation[3] are still proof-of-concept). Tails does a much better job at being a "Tor workstation" so it might be a good idea to try to make it fit into the virtualization concept - although VirtualBox does not support exporting VMs to OVA including a ISO by now.

I implemented a TorCtl command for dropping all guard nodes[0]. If it is possible for you to patch the Tor client, the patch might be what you are looking for.

Virtual Machines can be used to use Flash with Tor securely IMHO. But I have no clue about this USB stick..

Many attributes can be used to compose a unique fingerprint. Though Flash is one of them I don't see anything special about it - assuming a virtualized,  non-persistent environment.
