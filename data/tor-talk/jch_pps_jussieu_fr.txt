You certainly know that, but I'll mention that you can run Polipo on
port 8118 by putting the following in your config file:
  proxyPort = 8118
OTOH, would it clutter torbutton's interface too much to have an
option ``use Polipo'' that switches everything to localhost:8123?  I'm
planning to release Polipo 1.0.0 before Christmas, so a SOCKS-capable
Polipo should hit the major Linux and BSD distributions in the next
(Yes, that does mean that I do need more people testing.  Hint, hint.)

As Roger implied, working around your network's restrictions is
counter-productive in the long term.  The library's admins will see
tor users as a bunch of trouble-makers who try to hide from them.
I would like to suggest that you should go speak with the admins, and
explain what tor is about, that using tor is perfectly legitimate,
nothing personal against them, and doesn't create any new security
issues for their network.
Even if they refuse to un-block tor, they'll most likely be taking
a more friendly view of your further attempts to avoid their restrictions.

If the police forces of the country where you live wants to find out
about your online activities, they certainly do not need to break
tor.  They have at least two cheaper ways of finding out:
  - getting a legal warrant to install a keylogger on your computer;
  - installing a keylogger on your computer illegally.
So if your threat model is your government -- tor is not going to help you.

The simplest way would be to set a proxy that can do that upstream of
my_pc -> my_proxy -> tor -> proxy_choosen_by_me:port -> www_page
With polipo, you do that by setting parentProxy to proxy_chosen_by_me,
and socksParentProxy to tor's address.
  I know that it can also be done with Privoxy, but someone else will
need to fill in the details.

Please don't.
The very reason Unix is more secure than Windows is that Unix actively
uses the permission system to prevent insecure things like PHP from
munging the networking daemons.  By running PHP with higher
privileges, you'll make your Unix system just as insecure as Windows.

Dear all,
I'm pleased to announce the release of Polipo-1.0.1, which you will
find on
    For more information about Polipo, please see
  This version tweaks Polipo's default behaviour with respect to sites
hidden behind an HTTP/1.0 front-end proxy (such as Wikipedia) to make
it slightly more aggressive.  It also adds a number of completely
pointless options that were requested by the tor crowd.  It fixes
a possible crash that happened when using some of the more exotic
cache-control options.  Finally, it fixes a serious descriptor leak
under Windows.
Upgrading is not necessary if you're under Unix or using the Cygwin
port, but strongly recommended if you're using the native Windows binary.

25 June 2007: Polipo 1.0.1:
        Made Polipo slightly more aggressive when speaking to
        HTTP/1.0 servers (thanks to Fabian Keil for noticing that).
        Fixed a crash that would happen when a client used
        Cache-Control: only-if-cached, and the object was not in cache.
        (Reported by F. Zappa, A. Patala and V. Ghosal.)
        Fixed a descriptor leak when running under Windows.
        Made Polipo optionally drop connections after servicing
        a number of connections (maxConnectionAge and maxConnectionRequests).

Forwarding raw IP is difficult, I agree.  But it's UDP I'd like you to forward.
Considering your list:
1. irrelevant for UDP.
2. let us application authors deal with it.
3. that's just (2) in disguise.
4. I'm not sure I understand this point.  You could just forward UDP
over TCP, as long as you make sure that the entry node discards
datagrams when there's congestion.  (This basically means making sure
that your writes to the tor socket are non-blocking.)
5. irrelevant for UDP.
6. irrelevant for UDP.

It doesn't matter much in my case -- I'm just trying to ensure that
the user of Polipo gets an error message that makes sense.
What about defining a tor-specific extension to SOCKS that provides
both a user-readable error message instead of an error code?  I'd be
quite willing to implement support for that in Polipo, and I have no
doubt that so would the Privoxy people.

@_subject: javaprogram using tor 
Tor appears to client applications as a SOCKS proxy.  Sun's JDK can
speak SOCKS out of the box if you set the system properties
socksProxyHost and socksProxyPort.
So I believe that your Java application will automatically go through
tor if you do
  java -DsocksProxyHost=localhost -DsocksProxyPort=9050 AlicesRestaurant
Alternatively, you could modify your application to explicitly use
a SOCKS proxy by creating your sockets as so:
  new Socket(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.SOCKS,
                       new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 9050)));
Note however that Java most probably implements SOCKS with IP
addresses, and unless you take special precautions, you will suffer
from DNS leaks.  Which may or may not be a problem for your application.

Perhaps this tone is not absolutely necessary?
No, they won't.  Non-technical people often assume that DNS and
routing are secure.  We know they aren't, but they don't.
By routing their traffic transparently through tor, you increase their
chance of exposure to MITM attacks.  Unless you warn them, you'd
actually be doing them a disservice.
So are you or aren't you in touch with them?
You will have the same amount of protection if you put a stateless
firewall (with no interception) that forces them to go through the
proxy.  Please re-read the following:
Please re-read the following:
CONNECT is a sub-protocol of HTTP that is used to tunnel non-HTTP
protocols through an HTTP proxy.  It's sort of like SOCKS, but cleaner.

@_subject: Incognito Live CD using Polipo 
Excellent news.
First point -- you'll definitely want to set disableLocalInterface.
Since you're running with no on-disk cache, you will also want to
increase the memory cache.  No hard guidelines -- it depends on the
machine's memory -- (The default in Polipo 1.0.3 is 24 MB or 1/4 the
machine's memory, whichever is less.  1.0.2 and earlier use 8 MB).
I think that more experience is needed with finding the right value
for serverSlots.  I'm running polipo with serverSlots set to 2,
4 might be overkill.
On a related note, you'll also want to decrease maxConnectionAge and
maxConnectionRequests.  I suggest 5 minutes and 120 connections, respec-
tively.  Plese see
  Yep.  This is a reasonable compromise -- doesn't leak too much memory
while not breaking most sites.
Don't censor Warning -- it allows the server to send information to
the user, not the other way around.
Any suggestion for additional censorings?

Don't censor ETag and Last-Modified under any circumstances.  Polipo
will survive an out-of-memory situation much more gracefully when
there is a strong validator.
Nothing serious should break if you censor IMS and friends
(If-None-Match etc.), but it will slow you down quite a bit -- Polipo
will detect every server as broken, and do a lot of slow things to
compensate.  So I certainly don't recommend it.
