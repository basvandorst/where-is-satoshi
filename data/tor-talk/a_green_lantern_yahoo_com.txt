@_subject: "router get by nickname" on request to dir server appears to be failing  
(v0.1.1.26 client on Win2Ksp4+)
I have a few nodes I exclude in my torrc with ExcludeNodesconfiguration.
When I start tor (using vidalia) I get a series of error messages in mylog. eg [Warning] router_get_by_nickname(): You specified a server "xxx" byname, but the directory authorities do not have a listing for thisname. To make sure you get the same server in the future, refer to itby key, as "$xxxxx".
Yet these servers are all in my tor directory file and on xenobite'slisting I've noticed I even get routes (1st hop) to some of them, perhaps thisis because router_get_by_nickname() fails.
I believe keys can change, so I use nicknames because they always seemto be there. Its only for a few nodes, just where I have seen problemsin the past (eg always returning "closed connection" when exit node/hadunusual script injection from).
Can this be fixed or is it just my fault?
Also how do I turn off logging of [Warning] fetch_from_buf_socks(): Your application (using socks5 onport 80) is giving Tor only an IP address. Applications that do DNSresolves themselves may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g.via privoxy or socat) instead.  For more information, please see
without turning off all the warning logging. I use plenty of socks 5linked apps which will  have the ip resolved. I also have a localip/url cache which will also resolve them. I understand why its thereI'd just like to turn them off. They get in the way.  Finding fabulous fares is fun.

  ***Yes, it was set to 99.
It is possible for the servers to appear in your directory without
having a listing _by name_. Servers are listed as "Named" by
directory authorities if the nickname has been registered with the
directory authorities, and no other server is allowed to canonically
use it. If the name isn't registered, then any server can claim to
have that name. This is why Tor is suggesting that you identify
servers by key, not name.
I'll change this warning so it is more clear; thanks for the tip.
  ***Ok thanks, I undestand now.
  ***Suggestion:
  ***Seeing as how most servers nowadays don't appear to have officially registered names, could the system get the name from the ordinary directory, if it fails to get it from the directory authorities. A torrc file setting nicknamesource = [registerednamesonly, includedirectoryname] could keep it that way. Users beware using the includedirectorynames setting. Its simpler that way, if you
  have spare time. No need to say yes/no.
  > I've noticed I even get routes (1st hop) to some of them, perhaps
***Identity keys don't change for a given server, unless the server admin
deletes the old identity key and generates a new one.
  ***I noticed they were changing (but weirdly not their nickname). Maybe they are using vidalia's change id button(??).   ***
  ***For all the rest, I'll give it a try.

@_subject: new perspektive for tor 
There are 2 additions to this suggestion I should make (they have been suggested before no doubt)
1. Traffic Multiplexing. - Client chops packets up randomly and sends fragments via numerous routers to a single "hidden service - outside of
Germany" which reconstitutes the packet from all the routes it was sent
to it along, it then chops it up again (randomly) and sends it via numerous routers to the target exit node who reconstitute and does the business then reverses the process sending the traffic back. In the process the middle routers can multiplex the packet fragments from numerous sources into whole packets and so will defeat packet
monitoring by a global snoop. All of this can be achieved in an (albeit slightly modified) onion fashion.
The attraction of this is that clients will get a great deal of extra cover if they also become some sort of Tor router thus adding to the size of the Tor network. The client's own traffic being multiplexed itself! Now the traffic logger will have no possibility to trace a packet stream, timing attacks will fail and no one except the client, "hidden service in the middle" and the exit node will ever have the whole packet (encrypted or not)! d there is no need for the exoit node to have access to clients system ID, the "hidden service in the middle"
can proxy for that.
2. Random Tor routing length - to further seize up any packet based mapping by the  global snoop, require Tor traffic to move in random length circuits (say between 3 - 6 hops - user settable to a minimum of
3 and a maximum of 7or8 would be nice -  an algorithm to ensure a good spread without massive increases in traffic would work well).
Both will slow Tor down a little but the result would be packet monitoring would be totally useless, even if you have the logs.          ____________________________________________________________________________________

Not quite true.
An attacker, with government or criminal (e.g. ISP control) backing,
set up a dummy network with the correct keys!
Here's the threat scenario...
A. Attacker obtains genuine private keys by,
1. Attacker sets up  a number of genuine tor servers, could be tor
right up to guard level - attacker therefore has these keys.
2. Attacker infects genuine tor nodes with  spyware - including guard,
entry and exit nodes - therefore attacker can read the private keys of
these tor servers.
3. Attacker has a list of known public/private key pairs. These are
generated over the years by government security service supercomputers
and their own secure network computers (around the world). Such lists
regularly swapped between 'friendly' countries and are fro sale on the
black market. Given any tor nodes public key, the attacker looks up
key in the list and it returns the tor nodes genuine private key, where
has it in its list. (Interesting note: here you have to imagine that
there is software of out there, like the tor network itself, which
be used for generating and acquiring billions of key pairs a year over
millions of networked computers world wide. You only need to store the
key pairs such networked software generates after they have finished
with them.)
B. Attacker simulates the genuine Tor network with guard, directory
nodes and lot - given it has the GENUINE PRIVATE KEYS. Actually they
don't need to simulate anything that they don't know the private keys
of, they just allow directory node access and time-out build
to non-simulated nodes.
C. When the tor client builds a circuit its circuit is restricted to
the simulated controlled network the attacker has the private keys of,
time-outs to those not under the attacker's control.
D. The attacker fakes apparent exit node ips in the traffic (including
reults of ip test sites like ipd.shat .net).
Hey presto... the attacker can watch ALL the target tor client's
internet activity.. no timing attacks and no scripting.

Hello Jan,
Again your statements are wrong.
In the scenario we are discussing the tor clients traffic is diverted into a faked tor network, on the whole.

So the simulated nodes just look like the real thing, when they are
Your statement that the attacker needs to control a directory authority
is a red herring!
Control of a directory authority is NOT required in this scenario. That
was made plain from the start!
Why did you inject this red herring into your argument?
[ Note this is not for debate:
And directory authority I suspect that given the private keys for directory servers, the attacker could also simulate these.
Here's a quote from the wiki you link above.
"How do clients know what the directory servers are? The list comes
with the Tor distribution. It hard-codes their locations and their public keys. So the only way to trick the user into using a fake Tor network
is to give them a specially modified version of the software."
So to trick the user (tor client) into thinking it was using a genuine network all it would need is the private keys of the directory server (as the public ones are already published) again these could be
obtained by methods A 1-3. As these PRIVATE keys are available in an UNENCRYPTED
file on the directory servers themselves. The same is true on every tor
server in the entire tor network!]

an Hello Andrew,
Well actually - I didn't invent this attacker, I just filled in the
of how this attacker works his magic.
As for the size of this so called attacker.
1. All western nato nations have the capability and the cost is in the
region of 10's of thousands of dollars.
2. Most ISP's/telco's could afford to launch this attack.
3. Any large criminal/political/religious/racial/social group could
most likely afford to organize this attack.
4. A group of dedicated hackers most likely could also
Some of these attackers would have to illegally divert the targets
telco connection but thats not a big deal. You only need a friendly
telco engineer for that.
I remember back in 2001 a telco engineer telling me just how much porn
traffic he saw coming through his telco servers when he was on duty!
The reason for the low cost of this attack, is that the tor source code
is out there for all to use.
The attacker only has to run a small tor servers (modified as required)
instance array and "Glue" it all together with a network simulation
engine. The rest of the network connection would be allowed to genuine
tor nodes (but would time-out/fail so you are only able to use the fake
network). You could run it on a single core-duo with ease.
Cheap as chips!
So most nato governments could do this as a small, low budget, research
project. And its truely frightening how many others could afford to as
Why did you exaggerate over the cost?

its proponent, by argument fallacy /ad hominem Often, calling someone a troll makes assumptions about a writer's motives. Regardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical,
Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore him or her, because responding encourages a true troll to continue disruptive posts ? hence
the often-seen warning "Please do not feed the troll".^[/citation

to redeem their reputation by discrediting their opponents, for example by
claiming that other members of the group are closed-minded, conspirators, or trolls themselves."
IMHO a troll usually adds little to the enlightenment of the group and but much to its temperature and hot air.
Typical signs being base unfounded statements like "this is pure FUD".
And if when a troll can't shoot the message down with slander, then it shoot's the messenger down with slanderous "pot calling the kettle black" statements like "Looks like OR-TALK has moved up in the world enough that it has at last acquired a troll."

@_subject: Compromised entry guards rejecting safe circuits (was Re: OSI 1-3 attack on Tor? in it.wikipedia) 
Here's the original quote text translation of the article in it.wikipedia from the starting thread to which I replied.
quote: "Tor works on assuming IP protocol's integrity. An ISP, however,
can work on a lower OSI level to divert an user's Tor traffic to a separate, fake server. ATM switching or MPLS labeling can be used to selectively deviate an user's Tor traffic towards a third-party controlled Tor network. Therefore, IP address and key exchange with an unknown peer do not ensure that an user has not connected to a rogue
I think this compares well with most of the aspects of the "scenario" I
described in my reply, albeit I added the necessary "pass through" component out to the real tor network to make it work.
[The "ATM switching or MPLS labeling" is just the lower-layer network protocol/method, many IP networks operate over these, its common place,
so don't be confused by that.]

Well at least this is (now - hopefully) accepted as at least possible (previously pooped on from many directions well before I dropped my "cents" into the discussion)...
If the attacker has 50 to 150 major tor nodes (as the NSA has) directly
under its control and has the private keys to a further 10% of the tor servers. Then most client users are definitely not going to notice that
they are being routed in this manner. (my apologies to US citizens -
NSA is just an example).
Would circuits be made to the real tor network? ..
most certainly yes, 100 or so...
and also to 100 or so simulated tor servers..
and perhaps even non-functional circuit builds (e.g. "closed
connection" types). to other real tor nodes.

numbers that know key the stored got think density 627 Yes you are right factorising this is hard, but thats not what I've
been suggesting. What if every time you generated a pair of keys you stored the result somewhere!
Say you owned a huge network of say mil/gov computers which communicate
securely using sefl generated rotating keys. As any client finishes
with a key pair they send them off to a central storage location.  If they are not there already they are added to the store.
To find the private key(s) you only need to search through the list of public keys. If you only find 1% of the server communities private keys
then you've got many extra nodes to add to your dummy network.
Hopefully you understand this and I'll get some sleep tonite ( :D ).

If private for approximately for I think you are using the purely theoretical  numbers and applying them
to the problem as if they were reality.
As I remember the problem with the selection of primes for PKE is,
1. the seeding of the pseudo-random number generator
e.g. with a 16bit seed then only 65,000 or so entry points into the number generation which leads that number of keys.
Even for an 8byte random seed the number of keys generated would be about 10^19 keys and obviously, following your example, this represents
less than a milligram of your hydrogen memory, about a breath of air in
the lungs of the average human being.
2. the pseudo-random numbers generators, themselves have not been
proven to be numerically complete. Indeed their very form suggests not.
Bearing these things in mind, it may be possible to "pick off" machines
where their key is only generated from a small sub-set of the total possible keys.
I am sorry I included the example of the prime numbers tail off as it only served to confuse the issue and probably got you involved in your calculation in the first place.
Hopefully, this brings a "breath of fresh air" to this subject and ends
the scoffing of some detractors.
Of course, the scenario for this attack, as originally outlined ( Re: OSI 1-3 attack on Tor? in it.wikipedia), is still intact, fully correct
and easily provable.

Hands up those tor nodes using a true entropy dongle.
FYI - I empirically tested a common pseudo-random number generator in the 90's and found it seriously wanting. So you and I will have to
agree to disagree over this.
Re: but "We've" ?? - whose the we?? (rhetorical)
Lets see whats been admitted so far shall we,
"Mike Perry also brought up an attack like this when he was working on SoaT. Alas (or perhaps fortunately), he's been working on Torbutton-dev
lately instead. The number of competent anonymity programmers and designers in the world is still woefully small."
OK - so the basic attack works - Mr Dingledine says so..
"Much more plausibly, you could claim that the US government has backdoors into most (if not all) modern OSes, including the ones used
to generate Tor's directory server private keys. If the government got the
private keys that way there would be, of course, no barrier to them intercepting Tor communications in exactly the way you claim."
OK - so you yourself accept that spyware could steal private keys. (And
there's lots of spyware out there)
"1. Attacker sets up  a number of genuine tor servers, could be tor
nodes right up to guard level - attacker therefore has these keys."
OK - NO ONE has challenged this, it would be silly to do so, so I guess
it stands as accepted.
Ben, all thats left is you (and your "we") disagreeing with the storage
of public/private key pairs (A.3.). For my part I am 100% certain this
is so!! I know it for a fact.
Therefore, please be good enough to lay this matter to rest and accept
that most is proven, if not totally accepted by all. There will always
be die-hards and face savers but we try not to encourage them to
dis-inform or-talk tor USers (thats the "US" not the "WE").

This question is for those with the knowhow.
A while back I got a number of emails from the same source where the emails were sent in "pairs" a minute or less apart.
The first of each of the "email pair" were large (over 700characters), the second were small (under 50 characters). On the face of it the "email pairs"  appeared to be a genuine error ("oh yes I forgot to mention" kind of thing) by the sender, so I took no notice at the time.
It was not until this week when re-reading these emails that I realized
the sender had all along been trying to locate me (I was an anonymous informant). My guess is that my contact was in fact an intelligence (probably British with the help of the USA) plant out there pretending to be a (British) activist with a grievance.
My question is, is this "email pair" (of vastly differing sizes) a possible attack method on a  Tor user, by somehow watching and counting
(to estimate the size of) a packet stream?

?- by tor network node source
?- by packet size pattern
and you get a list of possible IP's who could be the suspect.
Do this a couple of times for confirmation of suspects real IP.
Lookup IP in ISP's records.

themselves. IMHO, if we are already at this level of international government corruption then we must surely be in the period foretold of nearly 2000 years ago - of days when the 2/3rds of humanity are
deceived and the beast is in control. Of course, this is speculation (?? or did someone 200 years ago know the "modus operandii" of this criminal group). Slightly off topic I know, but none-the-less relevant to the subject. Maybe it s just paranoia or are all the pieces now beginning
