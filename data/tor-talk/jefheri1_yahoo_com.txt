Hello Andrew,
Great, thanks. I was heavily leaning toward them. Wrt Tor relay and Iceland, I think I will setup the Tor relay to exit only to my forum, as an exit enclave. And possibly running hidden service address if that seems smart and useful to brighter minds than myself. That way I shouldn't move a lot of traffic, unless the forum gets very popular; unless I don't correctly understand how such a relay would function. If the latter is true please educate me, if you're willing. Thanks.

Hello list,
I am interested in setting up a small Tor centric message board. Due to recent (and not so recent) events in U.S. Congress, E.U., and etc., I want to setup the message board in a country with strong -- and smart -- Internet privacy and security laws. As I understand matters, Iceland or Norway seem to be the best choices; is that correct? (I believe the Tor Project, or a group affiliated with them, uses servers in Iceland, but I could be mistaken)
Can anyone suggest (ideally from personal, or second hand, experience) 'good' hosts in Iceland or Norway? I also plan on setting up a Tor exit enclave and maybe Hidden Service address for the message board. [note: I only speak/read English, sadly]

Hello Tim and Simon,
Thank you both for your input. I have made a small list (see below) of the three Icelandic VPS hosts I will consider: eEnvo, 1984, and OrangeWeb. My first inclination is to use 1984, mostly because they're Tor friendly, but they don't' seem to offer the best service for the price...
[I'm pretty positive all three accept anonymous payment]
(A.) 1984 (  )
A friend of the Tor Project and supporter of Internet anonymity,
privacy, and security. This company has been in business for ~6 years
and is the biggest in Iceland.

Hello Proper
Thank you for the link. I do recall reading that ticket a while ago. I am not sure whether to allow guest posting, yet. Considering it's easy to sign up with an anon/throw-away e-mail address I think not. I think allowing anon guests is inviting trouble...
What is your thought on the matter?
