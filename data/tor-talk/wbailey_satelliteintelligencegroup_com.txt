@_subject: [tor-talk] William was raided for running a Tor exit node. 
When is the last time you were arrested, or even in a legal situation
which required your attention as a defendant? It seems pretty straight
forward, but I can assure you this guy is getting very little sleep and
his heart is beating out of his chest. Granted this entire situation is
taking place in a legal venue which I have no understanding of (The EU
obviously does things differently). I think it was pretty risky to
consider running a Tor node, much less being involved in running multiple
nodes. This entire situation is beginning to read like a Kim DotCom (or
Schmitz for those of us who worked for him at some point) novel, where an
outside force directed a local LEA to perform some kind of raid to get
someone's attention. This was obviously not a helicopter raid with SWAT,
ala RapidShare, but I hope you get the point. This guy is sweating bullets
because he has no idea what is going to happen next (in my humble
opinion), so his rational thought process and/or even discussing when he
will return the funds donated is a pre-mature at best.
Just my .02.
