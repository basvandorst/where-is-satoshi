@_subject: Tor bug?:  AllowInvalidNodes 
Guys, I've set up another mailing list for future tor complaints from unhelpful/ungrateful users should go.  All messages full indignation and presumption aimed at the people who have volunteered long hours for the tor project should be sent to kickme at torcomplaints.net.  The server (alias: MAILER-DAEMON) will respond with a message subject "Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender", which will confirm receipt and transmission of your message.  This will ensure that your conceit will be most efficiently disseminated to the widest possible audience interested in reading your demands of the tor devs.

@_subject: Using Gmail (with Tor) is a bad idea 
I know this is taking this a bit off topic (since people are obviously raising some important issues here)... but it seems to me that, in most cases, using gmail with tor would be pretty silly anyways?
Most people's email accounts have personally identifying information, so you've already lost anonymity.  What's the point of tor then?  As some people were arguing before, you may well be opening yourself to MORE snooping, rather than less.  I try to avoid using tor when my browsing reveals my identity anyways.
I guess it can make sense to use tor in the case where you've set up a special "anonymous" account where no emails contain identifying info.
Am I way off base here?  (Again, I realize that the points that are being made, for example about firefox, are of course important in their own right...)
