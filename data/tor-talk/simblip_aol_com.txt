@_subject: [tor-talk] New to TOR 
I received an account-ban from a web-site. I stood accused of violating  challenge rules and was cut off from a community I had grown to love  dearly. I can no longer post messages and/or send private messages.
I would like to re-enter this web-site under a new identity, but I am  afraid it checks IP addresses.
I was wondering if a program such as TOR could help me out.
Would TOR affect my existing accounts with other web-sites? I do most  of my shopping and banking over the Internet.
I have not downloaded TOR yet. How will I know it works if I do?
Thank you.
