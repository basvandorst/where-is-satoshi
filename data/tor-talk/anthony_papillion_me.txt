So i set up a Tor relay a few hours ago (around 3:30, it's 10:15 now) and, so far, it's used about 700mb of traffic (about 350 up and down).Is this normal or do I need to tweak something?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay data usage 
Well, right now, I'd like it to use less. Mostly because I'm on an AT&T DSL line and capped at 100gb of traffic before they charge me more. Right now, Tor looks like it's on track to use ~1gb a day which is only ~30gb a month but I'm not sure I want it to use that much all the time.
My bandwidth is set to >1.5 so I assume I just need to bring that down and I'll be good to go, right?

Wouldn't you want to connect to the proxy first? I believe Tor just acts like a regular  SOCKS4 (5?) proxy. So I'd assume to connect to an onion address, you'd first have to get into the proxy. Of course, I could also be completely wrong.

I like this idea. But I don't think it's something the core Tor devs should be working on. Too many ethical questions and too many 'gotchas' if things go wrong. Perhaps it's something an independent dev might want to take on but I'd keep it completely separate from Tor at all costs.

This is going to be an amazingly silly question and I will admit ahead  of time that I've not fully reviewed the source code to find the  answer but I'm going to ask anyway.
If I run a Tor exit node and use Tor myself, is there any chance that  my own traffic might exit my own node?  Of course, if this were to  happen, I'd still have plausible deniability since I'd be running an  exit node but it would still be too close for comfort!

Hello Everyone,
A friend of mine recently read something (I don't know what) that made him think that there were some issue using Thunderbird with Tor that might compromise your anonymity. I told him I thought it was probably a configuration issue that could result in DNS leaking if not properly configured.
Is Thunderbird safe to use with Tor?
Also, what about EnigMail and GnuPG? I read something that said there could be some compromising issues using these with Tor as well. Is this true? What is the recommended workaround? Encrypt outside of email then copy/paste?

It's widely believed that an attacker with a sufficiently wide view of the Internet could unmask and identify Tor users. For example, if 3195 bytes go into a specific entry node and 3195 bytes come out of an exit node a few seconds later, chances are pretty good it's you.
I'm wondering if there are any ongoing efforts to get around this issue?

Not entirely correct, as I understand it. Granted, quantum computing
will shred most (all?) of the ciphers we currently use. But that's
mostly because they will be able to do massively efficient prime
factorization using something like Shor's algorithm
( If I understand
correctly, resisting such technology doesn't require creating a cipher
that takes a quantum computer to decrypt but one that is resistant to
efficient factorization.

This would be a public relations nightmare for the project and a very
bad idea. People use Tor to *avoid* censorship. Imagine the horrible
press we'd get if the project actually *started* censoring content. Plus
you get to the issue of "where does it stop"? Once you start censoring
objectionable or illegal content, what criteria do you use to determine
which content fits?
No. By doing so you create an environment where people don't trust Tor
any more than they do the open Internet. Some people already claim that
the Tor project is some super secret honeypot run by the US government.
Start censoring content and you'll hear that whine escalate to a howl
pretty quickly.

Hash: SHA512
Hello Everyone,
I'm trying to set up a new Hidden Service but I can't seem to get it
to work. First, I'm following the directions located here:
I'm using Vidalia to edit the torrc file. The original file when
opened in Vidalia looks like this:

will ignore it

RelayBandwidthBurst 10485760
RelayBandwidthRate 5242880

What you see above is my entire torrc file. Now, at the end of the
file, I am appending the following two lines:
HiddenServiceDir /home/anthony/tor_hidden_service
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8080
I made sure that /home/anthony/tor_hidden_service existed. It does.
Now, when I try to apply my new torrc file, I get an "Error at line 1:

So, even though I'm following the docs, I can't seem to get this
working. Does anyone have any tips that might put me on the path to

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR bundle on hostile platforms: why? 
Agreed. Neither would I. But there are people who, for whatever
reason, don't have a choice. Sure, it's not the most secure (or at
all) option for running Tor. But it does introduce a lot of Windows
users to Tor, makes them curious about security, and does, in many
cases, provide actual protection. It's not like Windows just
automatically sends Tor traffic to the government or Microsoft.
That said, I tend to agree with a statement that Jake makes a lot:
Windows users don't care about security. I used to balk at that as I
have  a lot of very security conscious friends who use Windows. But
then the whole PRISM stuff came out and, when they learned about it,
they did nothing. In fact, I don't know a single Windows user who left
Windows because of the revelations.
So I have to agree with Jake now: most Windows users don't actually
care about security.
Completely agree! TAILS should be in everyone who cares about their
Internet security's toolbag. It's dead easy to use - as easy as TBB -
but provides an amazingly higher level of security. Of course, this
might not be an option for people with older computers.
I think this is a bad idea. It alienates Windows users and doesn't
give them ANY exposure to security software at all. If you stop
developing for Windows and MacOS, new users may never actually hear
about Tor or, if they do, they could be intimidated since Windows or
Mac is all they know. I think it's much better to continue to develop
for those platforms but strongly, consistently, and clearly, warn
users that they are still exposed and, in some cases, Tor may not do
anything for them at all, while advising them to move to a secure OS.
Users need education. Forcing them out won't help them become secure.
I deal with people like this every day. They won't move from Windows
or Mac to Linux or BSD to get more secure if you try to force them.
They will simply not use Tor.

Please forgive my top posting. Posting from a mobile device.
You seem to have been pretty active in the Tor community over the last  decade. If the communications format is so horrible to you, why not do  something about it?  Instead of going on a mailing list, using  offensive language, and saying "why won't someone fix this", why don't  *you* fix it?
Take a little time and learn how to properly and securely set up the  software you think is needed and offer the project your services to  host and run it.  That way, you'd have a solution to the problem and  be officially backed by Tor.
Also, I'm surprised by your "Im done!" statement. Isn't your privacy  worth a little more than convenient group communication. People don't  stick with Tor because it's easy or has a great mailing list. The  stick with it because they feel their privacy is more important than  those things.
Just to reiterate: fix what you think is broken. Heck I'd even  volunteer time to help you out if you needed it. Leaving isn't the  answer: work is.

I've set up a XMPP server and my users are access through Jisti. I want
to allow them to connect via Tor if they want. But when I tried to help

Proxy Type: SOCKS5
Proxy Server: localhost and 127.0.0.1
Proxy Port: 9050 and 9051
It simply sat there and did not connect. The alternate entries for Proxy
Server and Proxy Port are from two separate tries.

Thank you for the feedback! OK so, after reading this, I think the user
just wasn't waiting long enough for the connection to complete. It's a

over 9050. The only thing that didn't happen was issuing a NEWNYM
command. But would that have stopped the connection from happening?
Also, a quick question about the encryption service. I'm offering
SSL/TLS connections to the service. Is that what you mean or are you
talking encrypting something else still?

Great! Thanks, I'll try that.
As for how I'm going to do XMPP over Jitsi, yes, I'm wanting to allow my
users to route *everything* about the session over Tor if they want to.
I'm trying to offer as near complete anonymity as I can, even from me.
So the deal is that Jitsi should route everything: session signaling
information, call information, even the peer to peer connections made
for voice and video calls, over Tor.
I'm not too sure about voice and video though. Since that's done in a
p2p way, I'm thinking maybe those *can't* be routed through Tor?

accessing it via Tor.

bridges are useful. Once a blocking authority finds out your bridges
address, it's blocked and that's that. However, I'm not opposed to
