@_subject: [tor-talk] Decent guide to setting up an .onion site on a VPS? 
Tor is agnostic to the machine it is running on. A VPS is just another machine. The aforementioned guide [1] will walk you through the steps of Tor-side configuration but it's up to you to configure your webserver. Existing guides in this area have aged pretty darn well.
Be sure to read the document in full and follow the onion services best practices [2] linked under the operational security section.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Best alternative to Blutmagie? 
Perhaps not commonly accepted, but there's a minimal statically-generated Tor
metrics project which serves a similar purpose :) patches welcome!
