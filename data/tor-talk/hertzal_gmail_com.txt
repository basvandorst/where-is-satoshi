@_subject: [tor-talk] No more Onion Key after upgrade to 0.2.4.19 
i've updated yesterday both of my relays to the new version 0.2.4.19 as
So i have noticed two strange things at the moment.
Both relays do not have a Onion Key anymore. The signing Key is still there.
I have also browsed through torstatus page and recognized that some of
0.2.4.19 relays i have found also does not have a Onion key anymore.
So is that information missing on the new tor deamon or not used anymore? i
just wanted to be sure that my relays are running correctly.
the second thing is: i've configured an additional relay yesterday and also
installed the new version 0.2.4.19 - but still no traffic till today.
the old version seems to be getting traffic much faster .....correct?
the new relay is listed in torstatus.blutmagie.de so i assume it is working
is there any reason why a new relay is not getting traffic that soon as
thanks for help!
