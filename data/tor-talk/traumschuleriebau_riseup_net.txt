i can't answer your questions but maybe you uncovered a regression.
commit 1992c761308538cffea64abecc9e45cbd47b1bda
Author: Nick Mathewson     Split tls modules and their tests into openssl and generic.
    Also, add a stubbed-out nss version of the modules.  The tests won't
    pass with NSS yet since the NSS modules don't do anything.
    This is a good patch to read with --color-moved.
Please file a ticket to keep trac.
