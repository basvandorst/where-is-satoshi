@_subject: ExitPolicy: ports 1024-65535 needed? 
After recently setting up a Tor router, I was wondering about the necessity
of allowing all high range ports.  Is this necessary for return packets to
be allowed back through the network?  Example:
  client:1024 -> server:80
  server:80   -> client:1024
If all I have is:
  ExitPolicy accept *:80, reject *:*
Will this block the first packet, the second packet, both, or neither?

The client knows what the exit policy of any particular router is because it
is published in the directory.  The client will choose an exit router that
supports the ip/port they are trying to reach.
This is exactly what the exit policy does.  It allows each router the
determine what level of potential abuse it is willing to tolerate.
Absolutely!  In the current 3 node per circuit design, two of the three can
be middleman routers.  This helps share the load and the more independent
non-evil routers in the network, the better chance you have of picking a
non-compromised circuit.
