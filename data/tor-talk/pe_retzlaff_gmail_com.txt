browser loads fine for me.
After setting "gfx.direct2d.disabled" the browser runs even without

I also vaguely remember having problems with standard Firefox crashing
randomly on my machine, some time ago. Disabling direct2d solved the
problem back then, and indeed, both flags were still enabled in my Firefox
