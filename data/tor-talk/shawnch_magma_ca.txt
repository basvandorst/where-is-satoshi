@_subject: Dos attack against my tor node? 
Another data point:  according to my mrtg graphs (ie. traffic rates) a similar thing may have happened to me yesterday between 12:30 and 12:45 pm EST.  Downstream suddenly saturated for what looks like 10-15 minutes when there was nobody using the network.
Unfortunately I don't have logging turned on at my firewall so I can't be sure it was a dos; I have only been running tor for a few months but that hasn't happened before.
