@_subject: Heads in clouds (Was Re: Abuse statistics) 
Don't worry, Scar's just a typical overly paranoid privacy advocate.
Quite sad actually, given that such people were very liberal not too
long ago, and in fact, the very such people that might do or encourage
such amateur experimenting.
If you think about it, Tor itself is very much a clooge of the type
that might be thought of through informal experiments. It takes an
existing technology, strong encryption, and wraps data in it like a
Russian doll.
When people get their head so far in the clouds that they forget the
practical spirit that pioneered their own fields of study, it
thoroughly disgusts me. I want to hear less about worries about
completely neutered statistics, licensing worries, and other such
e-penis fights, and hear more about what we had before.
Let's bring back the spirit we once had.

@_subject: Researchers could face legal risks for Tor network snooping 
Perhaps the researchers should have tried *using* the very network
they were snooping on. This is exactly what publishing anonymously
could be useful for...

Regardless of what most of the people on this list think, many people
use Tor to browse things that might be seen as controversial by
mainstream society. Pornography is one of those things, particularly
when it comes to unusual kinks or fetishes that they might not want
everyone to know they have.
I think Tor's about more than just freedom of speech. It's about
freedom to read and view what you wish, also. The intellectual value
of what's being viewed, or lack of it, has nothing to do with it.

Although I'm sure a lot of the paranoid sticklers will be upset by you
doing this, I think you should keep doing it. It is a quite
interesting project, and as far as I can see, doesn't cause any harm.

If he's not concerned with possible legal problems, like if he's
staying anonymous, this really doesn't matter. It's really his choice.

IMO not very much at all, as long as your node remains anonymous. You
shouldn't be endangering the anonymity of users.
