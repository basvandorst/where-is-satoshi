@_subject: Trouble installing vidalia package 
I've been trying to install Tor on a Mac (ibook G4 OSX 10.3.9) but for some reason can't get the installer package to open. The message I get is;   "vidalia-bundle - 0.1.2.18-0.0.14-panther" cannot be opened. There was an unknown error with the package (999)"
I downloaded the Panther package from the 2 links below but neither worked. If someone could give me a pointer as to what might be wrong and how I could get it to open I'd appreciate it. Thanks
10.3 (Panther): 0.1.2.18b
Mac OS X (Panther)  	 0.0.14

I download it to a folder on my desktop and then Camino opens it This is the file I get;  vidalia-bundle-0.1.2.18-0.0.14-panther.dmg
Seems the only difference is a missing 'b' after the 18.  Anyway the dmg file I download does open. It's when I drag the mpkg file from the disk to my desktop and double click on that that the error message in the Installer shows up - the Installer only gets as far as the first pane. Perhaps it's a fault that's developed within my OS? (although I was able to open and install a pkg file earlier today.)

Thanks Andrew, that worked fine this time. As with installing software from a cd-rom I mistakenly thought dragging the mpkg from the disk would also have been preferable. Thats useful to know
