Hi Everyone,
The first ever BSides Winnipeg currently has its CFP open and would
like to invite anyone who is interested in speaking to submit!
If you are interested in submitting, please see

board of directors, so if anyone has questions, please feel free to
contact me off-list.
The deadline for submissions is June 30th.
