You probably want the Tor spec documentation.

This is chromium bug[1] deserves more stars from the privacy community that
wants to choose to use Chrome/ Chrome OS via tor. It's a different
privacy/security trade off depending on your threat model.
Chrome is getting much more friendly towards multiple simultaneous profiles
which makes it usable to have a privacy hardened profile.
I suspect the first place we see a build system attack is in court
documents or a Lavabit type scenario.

It would be great to have a write up on how SecureLoad is intended to work.
I'd like to point out the swarm file sharing via WebRTC should work fine
over .onion addresses.

When I read the story this morning, my first thought was "Mike Perry's
build system nightmares are all true"
Fred says the deterministic builds for iOS are impossible because Apple's
FairPlay DRM.
RAM can't be trusted either.
Everytime I think we've hit local peak dystopia, we go deeper.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Potential uses for the Tor network 
Tor Hidden Services have a lot utility in the context of peer of peer
Consider how Tor and Hidden Services work in Bitcoin.
1. The user sets up a Hidden Service for their Bitcoin.
2. Once the user's node starts, the .onion address of their hidden service
is circulated in the bitcoin gossip network. Basically other bitcoin nodes
tell each other about all the Bitcoin node they learn about.
3. Other bitcoin nodes will learn about the new hidden service from the
nodes they are connected to and the tor aware nodes will connect with them.
Hidden Services have a number of advantages over other peer to peer
1. Hidden Services enforce a binding keypair to each node on the peer to
peer network. This ensures that a node x.onion that we learn about through
the gossip network is the name node x.onion that we connect to. Most peer
to peer networks make the assumption that you'll be able to find some
honest nodes to connect to.
2. Tor tells the users ISP that you run Tor but tells them very little
about what other peer to peer services the users run on top of Tor.
3. Tor Hidden Services provide end to end reachability for to the peer to
peer network far more reliably than system like UPNP.

So the release of Pi 3 [1] means that there is a now a $35 computer with
hardware accelerated AES and Sha 256 available.
How does this affect discussion of both hardware Tor proxies and future
cyphers for Tor?
