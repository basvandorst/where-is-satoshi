@_subject: [tor-talk] [TBB] Tor Project's amendments to Firefox about:config 
hi, I'd like to know if Tor Project have made any
changes to Firefox's about:config settings and
what exactly has been changed.
is there any way to find out?
I've trawled through the docs section but failed
to find information that concerns me so far.

yes, I've seen the design doc and a link pointing
to "a number of Firefox preference changes".
unfortunately it resolves to something I fail to
grasp, namely:
24.8.0 release. DONTBUILD CLOSED TREE a=release
I don't know what I'm supposed to do w/ this
the links you have provided work fine.
my interest in these settings is to see
potentially "leaky" settings, like safebrowsing
feature, geolocation etc, and to nick them into my
"less than private" regular firefox installation

I considered that idea. my regular setup includes
additional extensions, stuff that I wouldn't want
in TBB for several reasons (more fingerprinting).
switching it on and off constantly does not seem
like a good idea.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB does not employ fontconfig settings 
linux. regular firefox looks just fine but TBB
seemingly does not take neither fonts.conf nor
Xresources into account, thereby rendering fonts
worse than ff does.
is there a reason for such behaviour? I could
certainly live with it but I'd like to fix it.
moreover it worked fine in a virtual machine, no
font issues whatsoever.
