I think it might be better instead of relying on an untrustworthy a future someone to be tortured that you might use a voice distorter or simply use text-to-speech software to do the talking for you. A whole better alternative then having a security problem. Just saying, thanks for the good insights.

Is there anyway you can give us a translation? :-D
That certainly looks very interesting, or anyone else out there that understands German. Post a reply of the translation. Thanks!
