@_subject: questions of morality 
Hello all.  I'm a new member of the list and a newbie to TOR.  I have been looking for a worthy cause to donate my bandwidth to.  I think I might have found it in TOR, but I am a little bit hesitant because I am not eager to facilitate someone's wrong doing.  On the other hand, I would like to help those who would like anonymity online.
So, I suppose, in the end, it comes down to the simple question: do the positive uses of TOR out-weigh the negative ones?
I'm not looking to start a flame war.  I'm just curious how many of you have thought about this aspect of TOR in depth (I would guess probably most of you have) and what your thoughts were.
Thanks and sorry if this topic has been covered before.

@_subject: a NAT problem 
Thanks to everyone who has responded to my other thread.  Your responses have given me a lot to think about.
I have another question however.  In the documentation, it says that you can not run as a server if you are behind a NAT.  But, when looking at the config file, this does not seem to be correct.  It seems as though you can run a server behind a NAT as long as you have a static IP and all the ports forwarded to all the right places.  As long as my "address" line is set to my static IP, other clients will know where to contact my server.  Is this correct?  If so, then perhaps the documentation should be updated to reflect this.
If, however, I am incorrect, are there any work arounds?
Thanks again.

It does help.  Thanks.  I was just confused momentarily by the documentation.  On first read, it appears that if you are behind any sort of a NAT that you can not be a server.
Thanks again.

@_subject: Tor: Please block these file-sharing ports from your exit 
I'm running v. 0.0.9.3.  It crashed early this morning.  I didn't get to see the error message, as the computer also locked up shortly after (probably wasn't related though).
After restarting the client, I get the following error:
[notice] directory_handle_command_get(): My directory is empty. Closing.
Any ideas?

Thanks again to everyone who answered my concerns.  My server (blackbox) is now up and running.

I do.  Both BT and TOR seem to work fine on my machine.  I would be
happy to send a screen shot, though I must confess that I have no
idea on how to do so. :)  If you could clew me in, I'd be happy to
The only other thing I could think to suggest would be uninstalling
your network adapters, protocols, ETC. ETC. and reinstalling.  Either
that or format and do a complete reinstall of the OS (gagg!).
Good luck.

Looks ok, although 6699 is also a port used by WinMX and the like.

LOL.  Perhaps if we can convince every major power that every other major
power is actively using TOR, then they will all run servers and the network
will be stronger than ever. :)
