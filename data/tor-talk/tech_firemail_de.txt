The TBB with TorButton has the ability to delete all cookies.
Than the site can't track you, but you can enable first party cookies.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser for Raspbian 
Hash: SHA512
I want to use my Raspberry as a easy and cheap Tor access. But not to
setup Tor is the problem, to setup the browser in a secure way is the
problem. I had a browser setup before I used TBB and thought I could
setup it for myself.
At first I tried to copy the TBB profile to my Raspbian and use it
with Iceweasel. No success, the Torbutton was missbehaving and the
browser was not using Tor.
The second thing I tried was to extract the browser profile from
TAILS. No success too.
Now I want to create a profile for myself that could be used with
Iceweasel on Raspbian. I write here what I would change in about:config.
If you think I have forgotten something or have done something wrong,
please correct me.
change the proxysettings to Socks 5 and your adress and port.
change useragent to TBB useragent string:
about:config --> general.useragent.override --> Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT
6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0
dsable javascript:
about:config --> javascript.enabled --> false
OR install NoScript
deactivate DOM storage:
about:config --> dom.storage.enabled --> false
disable geolocation:
about:config --> geo.enabled --> false
disable referrer:
about:config --> network.http.sendRefererHeader --> 0
about:config --> network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer --> false
OR install Refcontrol
redirect DNS requests through Proxy (TOR):
about:config --> network.proxy.socks_remote_dns --> true
disable etags (disable HTTP cache):
about:config  --> network.http.use-cache --> false
disable screenshots for NewTab page:
about:config  --> browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled  --> true
disable link prefetching:
about:config --> network.prefetch-next --> false
disable DNS prefetching:
about:config --> network.dns.prefetch --> false
about:config --> network.dns.disablePrefetch --> true
change text encoding to UTF-8 in preferences
disable webgL:
about:config --> webgl.disabled --> true
install HTTPSeverywhere

Tanks for the link, but I can't programm a single line code.
Or do I only have to compile the sourcecode on an arm processor?
The other question is: To get a secure browser I need the changed
iceweasel programm, the profile and the extensions?
Maybe there is someone out there that can help me with that.
The next question is: I have only to prevent the browser leak my real
IP adress and personal information, right? Than a very
restrictive profile may work too.

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Onion Pi and Tor Talk Meta 
Hash: SHA512
Everything you send to the internet while you are in the onion pi wlan
is tunneled through tor. The DNS leak issue only happen when you
configure a proxy in your browser, than some browsers aren't sending
the DNS requests through the proxy. But if you are connected to your
tor wlan, than the DNS requests only can go through tor.
The only problem I see for you skype is blocking, so far I know, tor
exit nodes. The second issue is that skype uses UDP protocol and tor
can only tunnel TCP protocol.
I think skype won't work for you.

I am using AFWall+, but want to force some apps through TOR.
At orwall.org I read, that OrWall mey interfere with other firewalls.
I saw that in settings I can restrict an app to have internet
connections, force it throug TOR and let them connect to the internet
without TOR.
My question is: Has OrWall the capacity to have varios rule sets for
WiFi, mobile internet and roaming? And if not, will it maby added some

hi stn,
In my opinion you aren't right if you think that it's good for diversity
when you are hosting your TOR rely on torcloud.
Because if many people think so, than on torcloud will be several
virtual TOR relys. Physicaly they all are running in one of Amazon
datacenters. The annonymity of onion routing relys on not knowing all
points of your connections. If many people hosting a virtual TOR router
at the same datacenter, than the possibility that TOR chooses 3 TOR
routers in the same datacenter or at datacenters that are running by
Amazon will be higher.

Hash: SHA512
I talked about that issue some months before on the mailing list.
Like Roger said it is more work to harden Firefox or Iceweasle on (I
assume you are using Raspbian?) for Arm.
I liked very much, that if you compule tor on arm you get an DEB file.
It would be greate if there where a compiling script, for compiling the
TBB sourcecode on any platform.

Hash: SHA512
I don't know wheather this was fixed until now or not, maybe it's not a
bug, it's a feature.
When I closed some tabs in TBB I could reopen them by pressing
Ctrt+Shift+T regardless you are in private mode or not.
When you search in about:config for browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo
and set the variable to 0 TBB won't reopen your closed tabs anymore.

if I give someone a link to a file, are there hash in the link?
how does hashing work in your program and which hashes do it use?
Is your program computing an hash per file or several hashes / macs per
part of an file like torrent with tiger tree hash?

I think this feature is no good for TBB. Chrome for example don't let
you reopen tabs when they where closed in private mode. I deactivated
the tab restoration in TBB for myself.

maybe I am paranoid, but could you implement an second hash computed
out of the file. SHA-256 would be perfect, because when you have
security in mind, NSA could break SHA-1. When you are using two hashing
algos than it is even harder to attack it.

Hash: SHA512
I don't meant to change the hash funktion from SHA-1 to SHA-256, I
meant to hash the 100 KB blocks and the higher level hashes with SHA-1
and to provide a SHA-256 hash that is generated from the file itself
Because two hashes are more secure than one, even if one of them is
broken, because if someone can find a collision in one hash he can't
find a collision in the second at the same time.
The two hash method is only mode secure than a single hash, if someone
can't reverse calculate an information out of the hash. But SHA-1 is so
far I know only vulnarable to collisions at some specific conditions.
Maybe it will be mode secure to use RIPE-MD 160 for hashing the tree
hashes and provide a SHA-256 hash for the whole file too.

Hash: SHA512
I saw you configured 1000 kbits/sec.
8 bit are 1 byte.
1000 kbits = 125 kbytes (kb).
I think tor atlas show your upload rate in kbyte/sec.
If you want to upload 1 MB/s you have to type in 8000 kbits/sec.
