@_subject: [tor-talk] Email provider for privacy-minded folk 
For my email privacy I elected to run my own server. I use SmarterMail by SmarterTools. It has a really nice web interface as well as IMAP and POP3. There is a free version where you can run a personal server with 10 email accounts and 1 domain.

Probably some sort of social/political goal that they agree with, though
if you said you were mostly interested in privacy and were willing to
donate more than they recommend, I somewhat doubt they'd turn you down.
I don't know how difficult it is; I got this account a long time ago,
and when I did I knew people using Riseup.
The way you get recommendations is by generating an invite code on
I rarely need "support," but when I have a question for the Riseup
people they're always in IRC.
I immediately delete messages from the server anyway; but before I did
that I raised my quota (you can do it from their user page). I justified
that to myself by giving them more support, as they mention on the page
where you can raise your quota.

Is this release going to break Torbirdy since Torbirdy requires Vidalia?
