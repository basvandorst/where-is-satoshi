Personally I am ashamed and disappointed that we are even dignifying a call
for censorship with discussion.
Give me 10 seconds to write off this massive DoD-funded well-poisoning

disappear into the invisible internet project.

getting it through any channel that lens itself to Interdiction so mail
order is out... Please someone give us a better answer than this, I really
hope I'm very wrong.
