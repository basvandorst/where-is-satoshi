@_subject: Next news from Germany 
Hi Karsten and everyone,
im running a tor server, too (fractal) . Like many german tor server  this one is hosted by the popular ISP Hetzner (Bavaria).
Im getting strongly concerned about the online warrant discussion and  wanted to ask how you feel about it. I never
got any letters from the BKA; I dont run an exit node. Im thinking  about quitting my ISP contract and move
my server to somewhere else (outside germany).
Karsten can you give me or us some more details about your BKA  trouble. Do you think this is a test from the "Verfassungsschutz/BKA"  how far you can "exploit" the german law right now and after you, we  all will get letters the next month.
I somehow feel very unconfident about my situation running a tor  server and I want to be abit prepared about some kind of
storm thats maybe coming up.
