this is not really a surprise if you look at the distribution of the  bandwidth. I did some graphs for the bandwidth distribution of  As you can see in [1] the distribution of bandwidth over the exit  nodes follows a power-law (aka Pareto, Zipf, heavy/long tail, ...),  like so many other distributions. In the double-logarithmic plot this  is expressed in a linear relation. In this case the linearity starts  between 20 and 30 kB/s. (The bandwidth of the exit nodes is  exponentially binned which results in the equidistant data points.)
These power-law distributions have the well-known characteristic of  many small values and very few big values, also referred to as 90/10  or 80/20 rule. In plot [2] you can see the cumulative distribution  function (CDF) over the ranked exit nodes. As you can see, the 30  biggest exit nodes are holding 50% of the total tor exit bandwidth,  and the 100 biggest hold 70%. While this is still quite moderate it  shows how often you will see the top 30, even if the exit node  selection would only be based on bandwidth. But the "Fast" and  "Stable" flags of course increase this effect.
So there's no conspiracy, it's a natural law.

Unfortunately my own tests showed that you cannot block Bittorrent  traffic with a black-list exit policy, but only with a white-list  policy, that only selectively allows the ports you want to support.
It is worth to note that even downloads from hosts behind NAT (or Tor  for this matter) are possible with Bittorrent clients. The other  clients who want to download but cannot connect directly because of  NAT/Tor seem to publish their requests on the tracker and the offering  client connects to the requesting clients in order to _upload_ the  data blocks. So it is actually possible that a Bittorrent client  _offers_ files for download over your exit node.

Beside that, the data retention law does only apply to services in  return for payments ("in der Regel gegen Entgelt erbrachte Dienste").  Since Tor is a completely free service (no payments, no ads), it is  very likely that Tor operators are not allowed to store _any_ data.
In any case, UDP or TCP makes no difference.

Furthermore, since there is no gray area, who isn't  obliged to retain data is not _allowed_ to retain data, and can be  charged with a fee up to 10.000 EUR for doing so! Since Tor is without  doubts such a donated service, this turns the tables, and it is  clearly a risk for a Tor operator in Germany to retain any data.

The worst case will be TCP  connections, which are almost useless, since you hardly can correlate  in- and outgoing connections. (My node has always 4000-5000 parallel  open connections, and connections to other Tor nodes are persistent.)
This whole law anyway will turn out as a big joke (as usually), since  there are so many networks that hide thousands of users behind a  single NAT address, which _officially_ don't have to log, because they  are not public.

I would still trust a  node more that is located in Germany and is affected by the data  retention, but where I know there also (still) exists one of the  strongest data protection laws, and the data is not easily accessed,  than a node located in China, where they officially even don't have  censorship, but of course they will log the hell out of every bit, if  they are technically able to.
Regarding the improvement of Tor: I would suggest to assume that  _every_ node is compromised more or less, and that there are different  likelihoods between two nodes, that they will cooperate. These  pairwise likelihoods could be estimated (same country, same  legislation, same provider, good relations between countries and so  on...) and be used for circuit building in a way that this likelihood  is minimal for the circuit. The location of the client and the final  destination should be included in this calculation. But to be honest:  I'm not sure that it is worth it.

You have to look at the details here. The law tells them what to  _retain_, not what to _log_. It assumes that ISPs log that stuff  anyways. I have my information from a talk of the data security  officer of the Deutsche Telekom[1], but I just had a look at TKG 113a  (1), and it seems indeed that if you don't log, you have to make sure  somebody else logs it. Maybe they changed that paragraph after the  talk has been held?
Regarding your example: I wrote the same one sentence after the one  you quoted from me. With a little difference: they are allowed to log  it, but they have to immediately delete it after the connection.[2]

Shouldn't we differentiate what is being logged before making such a  statement? Regarding that a large amount of Tor bandwidth is provided  by German nodes, it is IMHO too hasty to generally claim that no Tor  node is better than a logging Tor node.
I claim, that even if a node follows the DR law it will almost not  impair the security of the Tor users, since Tor is somehow "DR proof".  The law-authors didn't have concepts like Tor in mind, when they wrote  the specific stuff for anonymization services. They were thinking of  simple one-hop anonymizers (if they were thinking at all).
So, what the law asks for, is that if you change any information,  which has to be logged by another party because of the DR law, you  have to log that change as well. Since Tor works on TCP level, the  _only_ DR relevant information it changes is the source IP address  (ports and destination are NOT DR relevant). So in order to fulfill  the DR law you only have to log at which time you had incoming  connections from which IP. Since the connections are persistent, these  are a lot. For my node that would be 4000-5000 at any time. I'm happy  to give the investigators a list of 5000 IP addresses for a given  time, since they will not have the slightest chance to get any useful  information out of this. Even if we assume perfect worldwide  cooperation and they are able to get this data from any Tor node, they  will end up with nothing more than a list of _all_ Guard nodes, and  there are far easier ways of getting it, and as a result of that _all_  Tor users at a given time. So even this unrealistic scenario would  just reveal very useless information.
So if the german courts and prosecutors don't realize this beforehand,  and really demand Tor logging, I'd just say: ok, do it. They will soon  realize that they will not get any useful information out of this and  drop the regulation for Tor again. It's "just" a cost issue for Tor  operators (because of necessary HD space), but not really an privacy  So even in the worst-case-scenario, please don't let the usability of  Tor decrease even more by switching off the German nodes, just for a  questionable and theoretical privacy improvement. But I still hope,  that somebody will tell them before, and we will never have to log at

Am 12.09.2008 um 17:50 schrieb John Brooks:
I don't agree. Normal Tor directories list _routers_, HS directories  list _servers_ and therefore  _content_ in most cases. And I don't  have a good feeling with mixing these two things.
To make a graphic example:
I don't have a bad conscience if somebody anonymously accesses child  pornography sites over my tor node, which is accessible anyways. The  site can still be tracked down and removed by the local authorities.  And as a node operator I even have the possibility to block such sites  with according exit policies if I like to.
With HS there is a new service space created. And therefore more  responsibility. With running a Tor node supporting HS I also make  arbitrary services available, which otherwise might not exist. I  really like the idea of HS in general, and there are some great  applications for it. But on the other hand there are services which I  can not accept to support (to create) with my resources.
Accordingly, it would be much more cleaner to separate HS as much as  possible from Tor and to see it as an application _on_top_ of Tor. So  I don't like the idea to make every Tor node a HS node by default.  They are two different things. To promote hidden services by foisting  them to all Tor node operators is not fair, I think, and can even  become dangerous for the Tor project. They should be promoted  As a Tor node operator in the case of HS I'm much more in the need for  fine grained access policies due to the higher responsibility. As I  wrote in a mail before, at the moment the opposite is true. I can  control access of general exit node traffic in exit policies. But I  have no control if and for what HS my node becomes an entry point.  Similar is true for the HS directory, which I can only switch on or  off in general. If for example the public in Germany will find out,  that there are HS for sharing child pornography and nobody can do  something about it, the whole Tor project and especially the HS  directories and entry points (but the public will not be able to  discriminate) will get under heavy fire here (don't know how sensitive  this issue is in other countries). If Tor will support the blocking of  certain HS for node operators at that moment, the attack might be a  bit milder and can be "rerouted" to the HS to some extent.

As for your article: as far as I can tell the calculations seem to be  valid, but I wonder, why others didn't address this in their timing  attack work before.
One question: You assume 250,000 users and 5000 concurrent  connections, so one connection per 50 users? Is this realistic? I  know, that most of the time a user is idle, but still this seems to  low to me, since once the user becomes active he will open several  concurrent connections (like for opening a website). And why do you  assume the number of users at all, I don't see a reference to it in  your calculations.

I'm fine with that. But I think it's not fair to force Tor operators,  that want to offer their resources for anonymous access, to  automatically support hidden services as well. They are to different  services and should be decoupled. So at least an option to switch off  hidden service functionality is needed. But I prefer a flexible option  like the one above.

I read this kind of argumentation many times and I don't like it. I'm  a fan of Tor, but even more I'm a fan of clean and reasonable arguments.
Still, the ratio of complained to total traffic can be a good argument  for Tor. But we should be able to defend Tor also if it has a high  abuse rate. At the moment Tors moderate performance requires a  relatively strong interest in order to use it. My experience is that,  because of this, people only use Tor in the moment they specifically  want to hide something, but not for the general Internet connections.  Since a criminal usually has a strong interest to hide something, I  expect the proportion of criminal traffic to be quite high, especially  in countries with a stable freedom of speech.

It's still a great success. A new law based on the very strict limitations of the court would be so much better than what we had until now, if they are able to implement it at all. And it triggered a new dynamic on this topic, so we can even hope, that the data retention will be canceled in general on EU level.
