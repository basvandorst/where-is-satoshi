@_subject: [tor-talk] How do you configure a Tor relay on Windows? 
why not use linux to do it
 I'm helping a user try to install a relay on his Windows 7 machine. They have the Tor Browser Bundle. I know we have to edit the torrc config file but I can't' find it! The webpage says it should be under \Data director but it's not there.
Is there updated doc on how to install and configure a relay on Windows or can anyone give me some advice?
