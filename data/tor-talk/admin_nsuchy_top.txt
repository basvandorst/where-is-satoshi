I have some concerns regarding the Quora Community regarding Tor. People
are describing Tor as a privacy tool but that's not the case. Tor alone
simply keeps your IP Address anonymous. You need to use PGP to encrypt
emails. I feel like there is a lot of misinformation put on Quora. There
are 650 questions even regarding Tor. I am working on writing answers with
technical information however it takes time. What should the Tor community
be doing to address this?

I don't answer for money. If wanted money I'd be a security consultant not
a writer on Quora. I answer questions because I care. I've gotten through
11 or 12 but I'm going to go back and correct them all (all 650).

new addresses are generated for each client.

@_subject: [tor-talk] PGP and Signed Messages, 
I've noticed a lot of users of Tor use PGP. With it you can encrypt or sign
a message. However how do we know a key is real? What would stop me from
creating a new key pair and uploading it to the key servers? And from there
spoofing identity?

If you stop Tor (Orbot) and then start it again the issue should be fixed.
On a side note why isn't Tor built into Orfox on Android? On iPhone there
is an open source project OnionBrowser where the Tor Binary is built in.
I am curious why the Orbot/Orfox team hasn't done the same.

The ability for CloudFlare customers to disable captchas for Tor users is a
great compromise rather than attempting to "anonymously track" Tor users.

Well now you said that publicly if we told you and you did it government
agents could add up 30 minute ip sessions to you and harm your anonymity.
