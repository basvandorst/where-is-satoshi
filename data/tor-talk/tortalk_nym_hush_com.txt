Hey all,
I am trying to report an issue with Tor Browser and, after consulting
the Tor Stack Exchange forum, this seems like the best place to do so.
I am but an irregular user of Tor but I like to have it at hand and
use it  from time to time. Up until recently, I would update
frequently and it  all worked smoothly. However, today is the first
time I try launching it  after upgrading to macOS Sierra and I am
bumping into an error for the  first time.
Instead of connecting like it used to, the "Tor Status" window stays in place for a while and eventually delivers an error message saying "Tor Launcher. Could not connect to Tor control port".
I upgraded to the most recent version of Tor Browser (the stable 6.0.2
and then experimental 6.5a1), created  an exception in my Firewall and
even deactivated said firewall for a bit,  but all to no avail. Is
this something someone else has bumped into?  Could it be connectivity
issues with Sierra itself? Some other functionality  that blocks
I hope this helps.

Thanks for the reply, Flipchan. Ok, I am no expert with this but had a look at lsof (mac equivalent of netstat) and it doesn't look like this is the problem. I'm attaching a screencap; the first test is before running Tor, the second is right after getting the error message. If I'm not mistaken, Tor is definitely using different ports, so there shouldn't be a conflict, right?

Thanks, Flipchan! Nope, as far as I can see, I am not running anything else on that port...
Still "could not connect to Tor control port"...
Any idea?
