@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor development - how to get started 
For some days now I'm playing with the Tor source code and trying to get a
better understanding of it. Also read all the documentation on
volunteering. I'm looking for a way to get involved with its development
but it's not clear for me how to get the ball rolling.
If you are a Tor (core) developer, what suggestion would you give me to get
started? I intend to start with simple tasks to get familiarized.
Thank you.
