I'd personally be happy to have more delays and slowdowns, if it was a feature that was making Tor's anonymity protection features more powerful. If there was a checkbox client side where I could select such a behavior, I would . Not saying it's feasible, or a good idea to do it that way, or even necessary. But in theory, sure.

All he did was use the word stupid.
I feel like Mark has not been abiding by this. He or she has declared Tor to be worthless or worse, and not presented even evidence (much less, proof) of this conclusion. Such could be viewed as a step further than off-topic - it would seem to be the opposite of the list's defined purpose.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why make bad-relays a closed mailing list? 
A bad-relays mailing list would IMO take a degree of care to do right, considering that email gets gathered at the packet level by intelligence agencies who are expected to be initiating attacks. Sensitive stuff would belong as GPG or PGP emails or similar. Juicy details regarding bad-relays discussion should be tighter than even a closed mailing list, is my thought.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bad Exit Nodes. 
You must assume that some of this is happening anyway, because we know that certain intelligence agencies (+ who knows who else) can gain backdoor access to the usual gear that sits upstream of the exit nodes (IE: the routers and switches of certain major hardware manufacturers). The traffic can be stolen there, and redirected elsewhere for examination.
Anything going out in plaintext had best not be particularly de-anonymizing or useful to someone who is sniffing (such as logins would be), let's just say that.

This is wrong in so many ways.
Edward Snowden's info, hand-in-hand with Prism's details, shows how NSA/GCHQ hates Tor because they can't break it very well. They have to exploit browser flaws and/or go around Tor to get what they want. If they owned Tor from the network perspective there would be no need for that, and certainly no "Tor Stinks" presentation would have been made. Instead of "Tor Stinks" we would have in our hands (again, courtesy of Edward Snowden) the details of the breakage of Tor by the spooks.
I have a hard time believing that you've been effectively tracking so much 'child porn, rape, snuff videos' content that you can conclusively say that all such content has suddenly disappeared from Tor. My knowledge about the way that kind of content works is, that no one person would be able to access much of it unless they were a creator/trader of the stuff. Such a person would be trying to be low-key about it out of fear for themselves, not posting in this list and seeming to admit to having been tracking that content. So - - not a match, for whatever reason.
The development of some of the posts in this thread seems to encourage list members to demonstrate/quantify what amounts of 'illegal' traffic may be flowing through the Tor network. I could see some interesting purposes for that information, none of them beneficial to Tor or its And, the conclusion below about "Tor and its developers" is imo retarded. That conclusion ignores good information while relying upon so much which seems bogus.
 > Well, let's put this another way.  On a planet, approaching almost 7 billion people, a network exists (Tor) that once had a substantial illegal content available (i.e. child porn, rape and snuff videos, etc.).  Then governments, such as the UK government, announce GCHQ was to assist in cleaning up the dark web.

Uhm, no. That's oversimplified.
Like someone said earlier. Only a few people arrested, but many sites down. Seems plausible that a clique of drug sellers got infiltrated/hacked and got their many darknet sites identified from the inside.
There is no "regardless of how it is actually done". "How it is actually done" is exactly the critical point, in particular if someone is trying to declare a plague on all Tor hidden services.
Another possibility, for example  - we don't know how well these darknet sites were set up. If they had the same developer(s), maybe more than one of the sites had a design problem and could be made to leak (which furthermore helped lead investigators to the clique). Or maybe, an ISP went snooping in a vserver and found interesting things (root on the vserver's host can get into a lot, including extract the memory contents). There are a number of plausible possibilities as to what-went-wrong that do not fault Tor hidden services at the core.
Those times when someone loses their ass for reasons that appear to be beyond Tor itself serve as a reminder to maximize 'opsec' to the best of your ability & in a way which scales in proportion to your privacy needs. Someone doing drug sites would, in theory, have a need which scales very high. If the skill/opsec was not proportionate,  well, there you go.

Speak for yourself.
(Because, right. Clearly it has proven technically feasible for you to survey Tor's users (and/or traffic) to
determine everybody else's uses for Tor).

Special Sauce, I'll buy that for a dollar ..
At a minimum, there are different kinds of detection for Tor within the Snort "Emerging Threats" Free-version signatures. So, this isn't even 'hard' necessarily.
One rules file is dedicated to it (emerging-tor.rules), that file has all the Tor IP addresses hardcoded into it. Additionally, there are other, non-IP-address related detections for Tor within other rules files (do an egrep in the directory for "Tor " to see those).
If you run Snort with the emerging threats ruleset, but disable the emerging-tor.rules (removing its awareness of the IP addresses of tor nodes), it still gives 3 alerts when Tor starts up. "ET POLICY TLS possible TOR SSL traffic". That's with a regular Tor connection, I don't know if bridges would change anything.

Or maybe they do realize.
We already know that the NSA/GCHQ do not appreciate Tor (per their own "Tor Stinks" report included within the Edward Snowden released content). A process which over time encourages the internet at large to reject Tor connections (plus makes ISPs generally unwilling to host exit nodes) seems that it would be in-line with the direction they would like to see Tor take. End result being - if a user cannot get to a particular site via Tor, perhaps the user drops down to regular internet for the visit, giving them what they want the easy way.

Back on topic,
You've been given excellent advice in this mailing list for your perceived problem (but seem to not have accepted it, being hostile instead) (IE: getting a separate, portable machine). That really is the best starting point if you are worried about hardware compromise. Moving along now, perhaps?

So, you single-handedly solved that pesky Unification problem!
Usually, people submit that sort of thing to a good science journal, and it's peer reviewed, and if it's sensible in the perspective of the reviewers (who are accredited in the applicable fields), things move forward from there. I did not see anything like that, but did see this  (banned user)

Tor-talk is a mailing list specific to Tor. Maybe this is not the best mailing list for what you need. I found some forums that might be useful, I could send them to you off-list if you like.
