I don't have the hardware for physical isolation (kind of), but I can use a router which is basically a Linux box that could do the actual firewalling and re-directing traffic on a LAN to a Tor client running on the router rather than in the actual server machine.
Altough I would prefer an approach where the actual Tor client is on the server machine.

Dear list subscribers,
Which ports are required for Tor and Tor hidden services though the firewall if goal is to only allow traffic though Tor?
P.S Should I ask this in the tor-onions list or is the right place?

Please don't make assumptions. If outgoing traffic is restricted, which ports are required for Tor to work as in outgoing traffic default action is drop?

In that case, what would be best approach to achieve that all traffic is forced though Tor and direct internet connection blocked, preferably even if/when the system is breached?
