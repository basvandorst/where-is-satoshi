Is there even a remote chance that the ISPs will take this on board and not tell GEMA where they can put the suggestion?

I think it's not so much the governments blocking TOR, they wouldn't need to. All they'd need to do is force ISPs to abide by the terms and conditions that almost all of them have of requiring you to NOT be running a server. TOR would count, you'd have your account removed and another node bites the ----- Original Message ----- Sent: Saturday, August 12, 2006 9:15 PM

Just an aside, in the UK, if an agency covertly installs a keylogger on your computer do you, legally at least because I'm going to do it anyway, have the right to remove it?

Your security should be an overall matter, where Tor is only for your
internet security. The approach for safing the computer place differ
according to the environment (that you shouldn?t reveal here).
Several floor above ground in a concrete building, or a wooden house
at the contryside, lonesome or full packed with people around.
However, a simple solution to know if someone whitout traces (or
even after a regular break in) had tampered with your computer, is
to mount a hidden surveillance camera exactly up behind a corner of
the room (a lined pinhole type, not a cordless broadcasting one).
If it?s your own house of wood, it can be done from above the inner
roof. You then somewhere have a surveillance recorder that start with
moving at the time you aren?t there. The recorder could be between
inner and upper roof, or below the floor in another room. Be sure
no visible parts is around and not accessible without open some small
screws to reach it (if under the floor, you may place a table or a
piano above). Of course it?s not good enough with a webcam by the
computer, recording into the computer.

Not think you're being a tad melodramatic there?

I have no knowledge of the fact, but is there not some provision in the laws of any countries with these crypto laws to deal with the, "I forgot" defense. Because I can see every single person being asked for their passphrase to use this defense. Hell, I know I would...
