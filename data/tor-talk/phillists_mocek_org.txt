I have no reason to believe that it has been attempted from every Tor
exit node, but [other people and I][1] have tried multiple times and had
no success.

I created three corresponding questions:
 1.
 2.
 3.
The third one, in particular, could use some revision.  Where is the
"locating paper" to which the OP referred?

That entry doesn't cite "above and other reasons," but only one
reason for refraining from running an exit relay from one's home:
risk of police seizing hardware:
    Q: Should I run an exit relay from my home?
    A: No. If law enforcement becomes interested in traffic from
    your exit relay, it's possible that officers will seize your
    computer. For that reason, it's best not to run your exit
    relay in your home or using your home Internet connection.
This leaves one to wonder if preparation for such potential
seizure, such as isolation of "your computer" on which the exit
runs from other computer hardware effectively satisfies EFF's
objection to running an exit at home.

It is down--for everyone--because it was hosted at David's home
among the various hardware that Seattle Police Department staff
examined while forcing his wife and him to remain out of view of
their activities.
