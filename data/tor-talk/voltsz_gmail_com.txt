@_subject: information about cenzorship in Slovenia 
Hy Matej,
I'm just curious about how Slovenian Goverment (technical issue) had blocked
the gambling site. I'm asking this because in Italy the law enforcement
blocked the site only reconfiguring the original site on all public DNS
where consumer (ADSL and dial/up) are authenticate itself (so: the DNS
specified by DHCP from AAA to CPE).
So, the site  (supposing gambling site) are 1.2.3.4 IP
resolved by DNS and every DNS in the world are resolved correctly. In Italy
that name are resolved instead in 11.22.33.44 that is a anti/gambling site
directly on lawenforcement facility.
I see two big issue about this solution:
1) when a computer authenticate on internet (dial in from ADSL or dial/up)
the DNS address cam be other one, only specified it by manual configuration
(on my computer I've a DNS server that use all root server around the
world). In special case, with easy configuration, can be a foreign DNS.
2) the gambling site can be rename the site name (transforming from "
 in "
I agree with your comment about that, internally in Europe, gambling site is
legal. The same about buy a car, make a insurance, using a bank. But Im see
that there are many interest about making this only on a paper... :)

Data retention in Europe doesn't cover the content of traffic, only
CDR (call data record) are covered and gathered all togheter for LI
Telecoms providers will now have to keep data including the time of
each fixed and mobile phone call made in Europe, whether the call is
answered or not, the duration of the call and other details that can
trace the caller, as well as times users connect to the internet,
their IP addresses and details pertaining to emails and VoIP calls.
The content of the communications will not be recorded.
The big problem about data retention is data collected for a period of
time, how to interact to those data and how to protect the data for
unauthorized access (these action is on duty in ETSI meeting).

Agreed. Firefox work better on security site nor IE is a big hole.
