Hi Scott,
Hi Scott,
my tor server arachne began also with logging of theese messages but to an other time and a longer period (64 minutes):
Dec 09 22:04:14.307 [notice] We're missing a certificate from authority tor26 with signing key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000: launching request.

The times are GMT+1 Germany. I'm using tor 0.2.0.12-alpha r12518 from a precompiled debian
package from noreply.org

I'ts a cd-rom based firewall solution that running out of the box a hardened debian linux without a harddisk. The configuration is stored
on a floppy disk or a usb stick.
For private use it's free.
You have also the option to run tor or other anon software.

Several weeks ago i registered a Tor exit node (123Tor). I thought
it's a good thing for privacy. After reading the mailing lists I was really
extremely shocked about the arrested Tor-Server admins and
other things.
The result was I'm shutting down my exit-node immediately.
After that I'm assume that Tor is needed in the free world,
so i set up a new node (arachne) on a debian linux box as
Living in Germany can be very hard. First the Hackerparagraph and
now the Vorratsdatenspeicherung.
Because of this I've just signed in the list.

1.) + 2.) Why occur this message? I'm not running a directory, only a relay with dirport and tornetworkstatus.
3.) + 5.) IMHO discussed recently on the list about missed certificates?
4.) + 6.) + 7.) May be a misconfiguration??
Does anybody know a reasonable answer or an explanation?
Thanks in advance,

You can get a list of all tornodes or only exit nodes on one of the following TorStatus sites:
Hope this helps!
