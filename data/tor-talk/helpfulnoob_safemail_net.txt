Hi again :)
Hi there Robert Randsom, thanks for such good info. Can you please point me to documents, or directions, to test FTP PORT command with my setup: Wget 1.13.4  (openssl 1.0.0g), Privoxy v3.0.19, , and Wireshark 1.6.8, on Windows 7 x64 Home Premium  SP1?
I want to test what you write, and so far I tried 'host IPadress' [1], at a FreeBSD FTP server [2], but I didn't know what to look for; am I on the right track? For now, I close port 21 on my computer, when using Wget; is that good enough for now? I look to see if there's a way to disable FTP, but nope, and that's probally showing my noobiesness, ha. Anyway, if I can help I'm happy to be helpful, so, drop me a line! :)
Here's how I started Wget:
wget -c --no-parent ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/
I don't know to what you're eluding, however, I was thinking the following setting may mitigate anonymous FTP issues, if I understand the 1.13.4 MAN entry [3] correctly...
(ex. in wgetrc.txt)
ftp-user = Jane
ftp-password = LovesTor
[1] [2] ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/

I forgot to add the settings for Wget, but they're big, and they're in another message I sent the list, the Tor specific settings for Wget are in wgetrc.txt and are:
use_proxy = on
http_proxy = However, I added other settings to my wgetrc, they'll be in the other message. Sorry!

Hi there!
I like your answer Robert Ransom, so, you motivates me to test GNU Wget 1.13.4 on Windows, for DNS [1], Header [2], and FTP [3] leaks mentioned so far in this talk and the talk "Download Manger" [4].
But, I'm only a helpfulnoob, not a helpfulJediTorMasterNinja, so, I'm not that helpful after all, I guess. I hope my little contributions below does someone some good, it was neat to learn and I needed a good download manger for Tor, anyway! :)
TL;DR: Wget v1.13.4 (openssl 1.0.0g), Privoxy v3.0.19, , and Wireshark 1.6.8, on Windows 7 x64 Home Premium  SP1: no DNS and no header(?) leaks for SOCKS4a and SOCKS5, tested hidden service and normal website; I didn't know how to test IP leak over FTP PORT, so I couldn't test. If anyone sees anything dumb, please point it out to me. Thanks! I didn't know how to make any sense of out Wireshark for scanning the Wget headers (i.e., reducing the "Limit Each Packet To" X bytes setting, I tried 58). Thankfully, it's easy to see the headers from Wget, and the website, using Privoxy's 'debug 8' setting (?show header parsing?); at least as far as this noob understands.
[1] [2] [3] [4] Here's my WGETRC.TXT file, with lots of comments about the testing, etc. This file is setup for downloading whole web sites, but d/ling single files is simple via. command line or batch file (just point URL to a file, not a dir, and using the "-e" command to override settings in the wgetrc.txt file, if needed). I might have done something stupid here, so, I don't advise anyone uses this until other people (not noobs like me) comment.

I dont understand what you're asking. Does _what_ also leak? In my http tests [1] DNS and Headers didn't leaked (SOCKS4a and SOCKS5), but, I couldn't test the IP issue with FTP PORT Robert Randsom wrote about (I'm ignorant of testing methods).
I cant write about torify as I didn't test. But yes, I believe it can be used to 'force' wget through Tor. Whether that would help with the FTP IP Robert Randsom wrote about, I have no clue, I don't know if torify does FTP.
