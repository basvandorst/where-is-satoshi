this list may not want a full on discussion of politics in Britain but just to say that at the last election in Britain it boiled down to a choice between Labour that introduced much if the basis for current spy laws or Conservatives that wish to further develop the spy laws and so blaming the people for voting for a party that increases surveillance is not a valid thing to do - as with many countries, democracy is a sham in Britain.
