@_subject: [hermetix] tor network status mirror 
just dropping a quick word to say I added a Tor Network Status interface
to Hermetix router.
The url is: I'd appreciate it if other mirrors could update their config to updates
mirror links.
As well I'd like to hear from any mirror not in my mirror links header.

@_subject: Set up a webproxy to TOR - tor-proxy.net 
Does your proxy use a separate Tor client, do you exclude your node as
as an entry?
I was wondering recently about the security implications of such a setup.
I was thinking of using a vpn to access my Tor server. From there, all vpn
traffic would be proxied through another tor instance running in client mode
with no bw limitations. Would that be more secure because a tor server
is already running there or less secure because, if in some way, the
traffic from the two instances could be differenciated and the vpn
connections would make the whole system less secure because they would
allow timing and statistical attacks relating vpn traffic to the second
tor traffic?
If this is insecure then you could expose your users by using a second
If it is secure then it is a necessary mesure, I think. Otherwise, you
could be offering access to a lesser secure version of Tor for your
users by circumventing the three nodes "by-design" circuits of Tor.

I was also wondering how this affects your proxy users anonymity. Even
if you don't disclose your proxy in the headers, there still is a
superior risk due to the fact that an attacker knows that there is a more
than average proportion of your users that are using you as first node.
This proportion is derivable from your proxy trafic (as you mention
there is some risk in having a second, different service that access
tor). Adding a fourth node to your server circuits could plug this hole,
even make it more secure for some users, I guess, but it would also make it slower, probably for every users (I'm not sure it would affect trafic for
which you are not the entry node).
I already use the vpn for other things local to that network so it's not
obvious that the trafic coming in is going out through tor or staying
At the network level both tor connections look the same (random local port ->
tor server port). I was mostly asking if at Tor's level there would be some
abnormal behavior (like connecting twice to the same node) that could
tell an attacker that there is two tor instances generating those connections and, eventually allow him to tell their trafic apart.
I was talking of a proxied vpn access to tor for tcp protocols. It's a
generalisation of your setup and so has the same implications
I'm not sure what a tunnel between servers could be used for (let alone
a vpn ;) Since you bring it up, I'm not sure but I think it could be considered
as an extension the family concept for tor servers...
Nice work on tor-proxy, anyway.

I came to the same conclusion. A tor client connection from my home to
the Tor network at least uses many entry guards. It makes that many more
"little pipe" to sniff for an observer if he wants to get the global
trafic patterns.
The security implications would be different if used by many users as a service
like XeroBank must do. I'm sure they do use just one instance thou, they don't
have the same bandwidth limitation requirements.
Thanks for the input.

@_subject: Advanced traffic shaping with iptables? 
See for such a script. I've not tested it myself, so YMMV.
the documentation on trafic shaping under linux is here:

It is probably a good start point.
It looks like the script needs Tor to run on a virtual address.
This could be done by adding another address to your default interface
# ifconfig eth0:0 10.11.12.13
and use that address in your tor config.
You should probably contact the author directly if you have problem getting
that particular script to work. As for iptables or tc related questions,
they should probably be asked on their respective mailing-lists.

@_subject: [hermetix] Tor relay going down 
Hi all,
I am sorry to say that hermetix.org won't be a router anymore. It was a
pleasure to provide this service as long as it was possible but
circumstances are forcing me to shut it down.
Anyway, I will keep providing a tor site mirror and I plan to update
the tor network monitor running on this server soon. It also doesn't
mean I don't plan on running other relays eventually, elsewhere.
Hermetix is an anonymous remailer first, this won't change.
Anonymity is not a crime!

Not at all. Those service are completely independant portwise and
pathwise. You should have no problems.
One interesting feature of having both is the possibility to offer
better and safer anonymity to your users by providing access to the
remailer services.

This was supposed to end with "through Tor hidden services"...
I see you still got the idea ;)
