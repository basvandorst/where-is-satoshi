@_subject: tor bandwith ratio 
I have had this exact same question for my server. It's running on an
ADSL line, 443 on the OR port, 80 for the Dir port (iptables redirects to
9001 and 9030) and I notice MUCH more bandwidth usage when I turn on the
dir port. Without the dir port, I barely notice tor slowing down my
regular usage. With it, I often want to turn off tor to do anything
interesting on the net.
I've been using the burst and mac bandwidth settings, but I think
prioritizing might be the better way to go. Any good simple references
for ip tables?
Another thought I had: Does opening up port 80 create problems all by
itself?  I'm imagining non-tor users simply going to 80 and doing GET /
and slurping the results from my tor server, but not really wanting it.

I might have an idea. At least on my WRT54G running OpenWRT RC5, the
system runs out of disk space running tor. I think it's the cached-status

I don't understand. You want a web based mail service that
stores the data encrypted on their server, but your browser
decrypts it when viewing? Also, the browser can't use Java
or Javascript to do this? How would this be possible?

That wasn't the original quesiton. The asker specifically said web-based,
without (in my mind) any of the tricks which would let you do browser
side decryption. If we're writing applications to do this, decrypting on
the client end isn't really all that hard or unheard of.

This isn't always true, I used port 25 thru tor last week. I'd revise
your statement to:
You sometimes can't send via smtp from tor, because some exit nodes don't
permit port 25 traffic.

That's exactly what I'm saying. The original poster asked for web-based
and end-to-end encrypton. To me that means the email is decrypted on the
end user's computer. If it's web based, that means the browser does it.
But, the original poster didn't want java/javascript involved. Another
poster replied that this is easy with things like Thunderbird and GPG. My
response above is saying: "well of course. If you stop using a browser
and start using applications, doing the decryption is easy, you just
write it in C (or whatever)."

@_subject: give tor lower priority? 
I just setup a tor node at home (adsl). Most of the time, my bandwidth
just goes unused, so I figured, I'd let others do something useful with
it. But, I'd like to have tor traffic take a lower priority when I'm
otherwise using the net. Do I need priority queues with netfilter? I've
looked at these only a bit a while ago, is  this pretty easy to setup?

@_subject: Something Strange Happens to google when Tor is enabled 
You should know, lots of sites do this trick, called geolocation. They
try and determine where you are in the world from your IP and display
different content accordingly. I know of at least Amazon and Google. It's
not the search plugin's doing, it's the fact that connection to
 really redirects you to an IP that's localized based on
