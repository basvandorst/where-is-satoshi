@_subject: [tor-talk] How does one remove the NSA Virus off the BIOS Chip as 
Hi TOR Mailing List People,
             I am apparently  the number one person in the United States on the _*NSA-CIA-FBI Watch List*_. For multiple reasons! I am the Coordinator of the United Front Against Racism and Capitalism-Imperialism who was arrested by the so-called "Major Case Squad" in August 1986 because our group exposed the scientific documentation on a big series of _/*huge*/_ wall posters that AIDS is Biological Warfare by the US Government Against Blacks, Gays and those with certain blood dyscrasias. The arrest was on the front pages of all NYC newspapers and on Channel 4 in Europe. I tried to send this email to Anonymous and TOR does not permit attachments so just disregard that when you see an attachment mentioned.
             Recently I was _*Extraordinarily Renditioned*_ (KIDNAPPED AND HELD AGAINST MY WILL FOR 18 HOURS AND TORTURED after simply walking along a road in New Jersey!) See the third attachment. The NSA has TOTAL control of my computer and has real time keystroke by keystroke monitoring and harassment while I am on the computer. My anti-virus and anti-Malware are totally useless as explained by Snowden because the computer is controlled through the _*BIOS Chip*_ as explained in the attachment on Snowden revelations. Scroll down the document until you get to _*ANT*_ (Access Network Technology). I would like for _*Anonymous*_ to publish on its website for EVERYONE, not just me,  how to remove and neutralize NSA viruses placed on the BIOS CHIP! Also please send the information in an email to me. I am sure you could manage this. If THEY can do it and YOU are the world's greatest hackers just like they are, then YOU can neutralize any garbage they place on the BIOS Chip. Kaspersky by refusing to help me in this also SUPPORTS NSA placement of virus software on the BIOS Chip because that confirms that I am one of the capitalists' most important enemies and therefore I am an are automatic enemy of Kaspersky. So I can go screw! Will I receive the same response from Anonymous? It is a rule of capitalist statecraft that a government control and operate its own opposition by one means or another any and ALL means. Anonymous is a supposed opposition group. So who is _/*really*/_ running anonymous and please do not say "everyone" or "no one" because that is the same BS answer given by the anti-Communist Anarchist group,  so-called "Occupy Wall Street." _*I need immediate help*_. And so undoubtedly do others! I am partially computer savvy. But I am not yet a programmer. Also, I am a Medical Doctor and a Theoretical Astrophysicist and a Professional Revolutionary and have recently finished writing an extremely important document completed after almost 2 years of actual work: The _*Materialist Analysis of Theoretical Astrophysics*_, which is a Classic of scientific, political literature. As it states early on:
             "Though it is of a different genre from "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin and             "Zur Dynamik Bewegter Korper" by Albert Einstein and the Einstein Field Equations                     which form the basis for the General Theory of Relativity it sits on the same shelf
             because it defends all three and takes it further and provides the answer to the ultimate                 question: What is the truthful explanation of the Universe?"
             I could have added "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," by Karl Marx, which is a classic object lesson in applied historical materialism. In any case we have to get rid of capitalism or capitalism is going to get rid of us. _*A non-response from Anonymous is a death sentence for the credibility of Anonymous.*_ You can give me the information on how to get rid of a virus on the BIOS chip or you can contact someone who DOES know how to do it. I will remove it every day if I have to.
             Also I need help in publishing in some fashion the second attached document. I do not want to hear "We are not your army?" During the era when political postering was permitted in the United States I spent over $50,000 of my own money on politics and the huge posters which used to cover the walls of many US cities. Our AIDS poster stopped all political postering in the United States by the capitalist dictatorship of millionaires and billionaires. We are living in End-Stage Capitalism. It is known as Rule by Decree, a form of Bonapartism as in Napoleon Bonaparte. It is expressed a a military, bureaucratic police state which is hardening by the day. "Democracy" under capitalism is merely a codeword and a euphemism--both, they are different--for capitalist dictatorship and enslavement here or anywhere else in the world. We have to get rid of capitalism or capitalism is going to get rid of us. Remember that capitalism is a WORLD SYSTEM and so is Communism. Socialism, the first stage of Communism has never ever actually been practiced anywhere and cannot be practiced anywhere until capitalism is overthrown worldwide starting at its center, the USA. We live in a a world of nation states. All nation states are dictatorships of one class over another class, either the capitalists over the Workers or vice versa. Because of the 1988 Surrender by Gorbachev to the threat of a Nuclear War there are a lot fewer Worker's States. We were almost there! In the 1930s we had a Million-Strong Communist-led Working Class Movement. But they were deliberately misled to take a bribe known as the New Deal. You don't think they came up with the New Deal out of the goodness of their heart now do you? FDR was given credit then and more recently on Cahnnel Thirteen Public Television for "Saving Capitalism with the New Deal!" If that Million-Strong Communist-led Working Class had not been deliberately misled to take that New Deal bribe there would have been no Adolph Hitler, No WWII, No Korea, No Vietnam War and ZERO of today's present problems. Look at the present world situation! Ninety-Five Percent of New Yorkers and the overwhelming majority of Americans and people worldwide agree we need a new system based on human need not private profit.

Hi Vladimir,
             Obviously what you sent me is the only genuine response I received. But there is still a problem for me but not for you. Here are your entries:
             1.) "see doc. on INT 9h (hardware interrupt)  and INT 21h (BIOS keyboard)"
             2.) Trace(debugger) from INT 9 vector - and see all...
             3.) Use loadable INT 9/21h driver - and any viruses can't have control...
                  (checked debugger in mem int 9 --> our driver).
             4.) Virus can't be detected, if signature not in antivirus-collection, but
                   debugger show all...
             5.) Also use not connected to network computer for typing and removable FD/flash...
             I need step by step instructions on to precisely accomplish this meaning that I need more information on how to do what you said. Remember YOU are a Hacker already! I am NOT! So please imagine you are writing  Big difference! So please imagine you are writing a book: "Removal of NSA Computer viruses pla on the BIOS CHIP FOR DUMMIES
             Thanks very much. I hope you liked what I sent you and have decided to send it out to your complete mailing list. Thanks again and I hope to hear from you in the very near future.

To Vladimir:
Hi Vladimir,
             You did not reply through regular email so the NSA may have blocked my incoming email. In fact today I received virtually NO email from TOR. Obviously what you sent me appears to be a genuine response. But I showed your response to a friend who knows how to program but he could not understand what you were telling me to do. So there is still a problem for me but not for you. _*Here are your responses to me asking how to remove BIOS Chip computer viruses: *_
             1.) "see doc. on INT 9h (hardware interrupt)  and INT 21h (BIOS keyboard)"

             Do you know how to or have you ever removed a virus from the BIOS Chip? Attacking the BIOS Chip is how it is done these days by NSA. Apparently they do not bother with the hard drive and go directly to the mother board. Here is what I wrote on the ANT Program described by Edward J. Snowden. See the bottom of *_page 8_*. I also recently completed the _*Materialist Analysis of Theoretical Astrophysics*_. It is self-explanatory. Before we meet to talk please read these 2 documents and at least read the first several pages of the second document and tell me what you think. If we are are going to talk it is good to know what is to be discussed.

Here is what I wrote in the Materialist Analysis of Edward G. Snowden
*"_ANT_"* (*_Access Network Technology!_*) is the *_NSA_* Special Division which has surreptitiously installed an entire catalogue, an "*_NSA_* toolbox," of hardware products into computer networks and computers worldwide (*/Der Spiegal/*, December 30, 2013), penetrating their digital firewalls through special "back doors." *_ANT_* has burrowed into all security architecture made by major network and computer companies e.g. such as CISCO Systems, Junipur Networks and the Chinese Huawei and also Dell, HP and all the rest! For example, the name of the so-called "digital lock pick" for Junipur Networks is *_FEEDTROUGH Malware_* (Oy!) and is used to */_permanently_/* implant *_NSA_* surveillance programs into even mainframe computers, spy programs which can even withstand "across reboots and software upgrades." The specialists at *_ANT_*, the *_ANT PEOPLE_*, work in the *_NSA's_* department for *_Tailored Access Operations_* (*_TAO_*). The *_ANT_* hardware is very expensive but the costs are all taken care of in the *_Black Budget!_* No problem! A targeted monitor cable that allows "TAO personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor" costs only $30.00, but an "active GSM base station" that mimics a mobile phone tower, which can monitor cell phones costs $40,000.00. The *_USB_* computer-bugging devices mentioned above, which are capable of sending and receiving data undetected via radio come in packs of 50 for over $1 Million! The *_ANT_* people (!) develop and preferentially plant malware in the *_BIOS chip_* on the motherboard. This makes is invisible to anti-virus or anti-malware programs. And even if the hard drive is completely erased and a new operating system is installed the *_ANT_* malware continues to function and ensures that new spyware can again be loaded onto what was thought to be a "clean computer!" The *_ANT_* developers call this *"_Persistence_,"* which simply means *_NSA_* has permanent access to the computer. Another (nameless?) program attacks the hard drives of Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor and Samsung undermining the security of both American companies and *_ALL_* companies! Other *_ANT_* programs target Internet large-scale routers and hardware firewalls intended to protect company networks. Many digital attack weapons are "remotely installable" over the Internet, while others require a direct attack, which the *_NSA_* calls an *"_interdiction_"* in order to install it. This writer has had his computer completely taken over by *_NSA-ANT._* The NSA has installed its software in the *_BIOS CHIP_* of both computers so "anti-virus" and "anti-malware (e.g. Malwarebytes)" is totally useless. This writer has keystroke-by-keystroke real time team monitoring & open harassment. If the *_ANT_* software was removed it could be immediately re-installed!

Can't you just buy a new machine with cash, and then make sure to never let it out of your site? What your describing would only happen if they have physical access to your machine to install ANT in the bios. Probably naive here, but I don't think that every machine made is already owned by the powers that be.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Answer from Chris Dagdigian to WH Depperman 
You start your email: "Because  his response was helpful, earnest and legit?"  I never said that, Chris. You said that. And why did you say it? What Vladimir said could only be helpful if a person was already a Hacker and programmer. So how would I know it was "legit?" I could not possibly know that. I replied strictly in good faith, something apparently not something found uniformly on TOR or anywhere else for that matter. TOR refused to post the _*Materialist Analysis of Theoretical Astrophysics*_ on its website. Why not? It is the most important scientific work that exists today anywhere and for good reason and it is all written in everyday language and easily understandable.
             Then you say: "The stuff you believe you are infected with is generally considered a valuable asset and is not disseminated promiscuously for risk that it will be discovered, analyzed and publicly exposed -- when they do deploy that stuff it's targeted at specific networks, systems, people and groups." That'll be the day, i.e. "for risk that it will be discovered, analyzed and publicly exposed," Chris! Hilarious! You can't even provide the key information that I need and neither so far can anyone on TOT! Chris, I am the coordinator of the _*United Front Against Racism and Capitalism-Imperialism*_. I am a Communist, a Leninist. From the late 1970s until August 1986 we dominated the walls of NYC with huge wall posters many 2.5 feet wide and 4 feet tall. They were everywhere. I was the primary author of those posters which also dominated Washington. D.C. and Boston and we had people in San Francisco also putting up posters. I am also a Medical Doctor, a politically Blacklisted Medical Doctor beginning my medical career in early 1964. Primate viruses were always a special interest of mine and I followed primate viruses even before that and afterward. I recognized immediately that AIDS was biological warfare. We exposed AIDS as biological warfare by the US Govt with all documentation and the pedigree of that virus which appears in the peer review literature for reasons explained in those analyses, on huge wall posters all over NYC,. This brought down the house and I was arrested by the so-called "Major Case Squad" (?!) and thrown on the front page of all the newspapers and made Channel 4 in Europe. The charge was ""E-Felony" postering. Total BS but it was done for intimidation purposes. I applied for Soviet citizenship but was turned down by Gorbachev himself through the foreign Ministry: "They were not accepting Communists at the present time." Only later did I figure out the deal.
             Currently, I am the number one political analyst, the number one blogger in the United States (blogging is no longer permitted on the NSA-controlled Internet) and the number one Orator in the United States. I speak for 3 to 4 hours uninterrupted at the south end of Union Square Park here in NYC. No one can do that unless people like what they are hearing and the person knows his stuff.
             I am also a self-trained theoretical astrophysicist and recently completed the _*Materialist Analysis of Theoretical Astrophysics. *_This is a classic of scientific polemical literature and is copyrighted, but obviously nowhere actually published. Vanity press means NO DISTRIBUTION! It exposes so-called "dark energy" and "dark matter" and the so-called Standard Model of Particle Physics as highly contrived lies. I have sent you a copy of it.
             So Chris, _*I am the number one target of the NSA in the United States*_ as far as somputer monitoring and harassment go. I have real time keystroke by keystroke monitoring and harassment by NSA. Almost all through the BIOS Chip.apparently.
             I have to know precisely how to remove and to be able to repeat the removal if necessary--and it will be necessary--all NSA software control of my computer through the BIOS Chip. I need someone who knows this area like the back of his hand as well as the NSA Secret Police do. _*Incidentally, the NSA and their French and British affiliates knew in advance about the Paris attacks.*_ The bullshit that they all knew how to encrypt their email and phone calls is false propaganda meant to deflect this reality. You will receive a few writings to give you and idea.of what is really going on. So please put out the word that the technical detailed knowledge of exactly what to do in this case is urgently needed. ANT is how everything is run on monitoring targeted individuals and organizations. Put any other ideas to the contrary away.
             It is a rule of capitalist statecraft that a government control and operate all its "opposition" on every topic. We are living in End-Stage Capitalism. It is called Rule by Decree, a form of Bonapartism as in Napoleon Bonaparte, and is expressed as a military, bureaucratic police state which is hardening by the day. That is unfortunately the reality here in the USA. and elsewhere in the capitalist world for the most part. Capitalism is a world system, Chris, and so is Communism. Socialism is the first stage of Communism which has never ever been practiced and can never ever be practiced until capitalism is overthrown worldwide starting at it center the USA. _*And we were almost there in the early 1930s.*_ We live in a world of nation states. All nation states are dictatorships of one class over another class, either the capitalists over the Working Class or vice versa. With the Soviet--Gorbachev--Surrender to the Threat of a Nuclear War in 1988 there are a lot fewer bureaucratically degenerated and deformed Workers' States. These issues are all extensively covered in my writings. So you can dig in there too if you want.
             Now Chris, I need you to get busy and make yourself useful, "legit," and prove it.

To Rick Evans:
             I am not a Hacker. You seem to be writing just to be writing. I have to have a precise explanation written "for dummies." I do not know how to do what you wrote either. And I think you probably know that, Rick. So, back up and try to put it into terms which I can easily understand. You say, shall we say disingenuously: "As far as ANT goes the Idea has been around for a long time." Huh? Yeah, right! What I wrote regarding the NSA Secret Police ANT Program as stated is based on Snowden's released documents. I am sending you a copy. Your attempt to trivialize it falls completely FLAT! Sorry about that Rick. What you have written would be helpful, which it is not in a practical sense, but only in the sense intended which is apparently to intimidate for who's benefit? You say: "Xp was found to have a class ID named NSAkey buried deep in it's code." Duh! We couldn't guess that, right. The point is to pinpoint it and give simple "for dummies" practical steps to eliminating that access key.

To Chris "Rise Up" Dagdigian:
             You are simply an anti-Communist airhead with no education or knowledge base. I sent you some material which you have ignored in a classic example of _*throwing pearls before swine*_. What you said is useless and everyone should be able to recognize the brainwashed person that you are. Sorry, "Chris Rise Up." Chris "Rise up" tells us all to buy new computers if the NSA would put software in their BIOS Chips, _*which would instantly be re-infected *_or "do what mr. torvalds does and actually stay offline except using other people's machines or in libraries, Apple stores, etc." Your knee jerk reactionary response is a joke which most people should be able to easily recognize. He would "stand by (his) recommendations. What a joke. This kid is probably in his early twenties and imagines himself some great hacker. At total joke!

I was not "confusing you with someone from RiseUp." You and the person I emailed are the same person. Your "advice" in fact is precisely the same given by Chris "RiseUp" Dagdigian. Who do you think you are fooling? You are just changing your tune disingenuously after the fact because what you wrote was so hostile and anti-hominem. As I requested previously stay out of issues where your only purpose is to spread disinformation.
You are confusing me with someone from RiseUp in your last few emails
Lets make this simple. I will not attempt to give you any advice. I'll just tell you what I would personally do if I thought I was being directly targeted by someone with nation-state levels of technical I'd trash my computer and replace it with an fresh one bought with cash from some big box store or other location that moves a lot of units.  The main reason is that with an adversary backed by nation-state levels of technical skills and resources I'd never be 100% sure I was able to clean it out completely so I'd never be able to trust that computer again. The only solution is to trash it, trade it, sell it or otherwise stop using it.
Best of luck.
