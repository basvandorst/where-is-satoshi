@_subject: [tor-talk] Help test a new RBG 
We have placed MKRAND - A Digital Random Bit Generator, on GitHub, and it
would be helpful to receive some feedback regarding its potential use in
the TOR project.
This RBG does not use mathematical methods, and thus does not suffer from
wraparound issues or dependency on ALU architectures.
The RBG can be considered alpha-quality at this stage and is not ready for
production use, however it is appropriate for research into new kinds of
obfuscation protocols and key generation schemes.
