@_subject: [tor-talk] Connection / socket issues with Tor on Mac OS 
Hi all,
so, I'd like to use Tor on my Mac, and access the web through its network of servers. So far so good, but as I'm familiar with Linux and the shell, I don't want to bring up Tor using the Vidalia GUI, but rather call it from Terminal and later on have both Tor and Polipo launched as daemons.
So, I had a look at both the Torrc.sample file (Which I then renamed to torrc and moved to /Applications/Vidalia.app/tor). Also, I had a look at polipo.conf, however didn't change any of the settings. Then, I launched Tor as follows:
Robins-MacBook-Air:MacOS owomac$ ./tor
Aug 06 20:01:55.509 [notice] Tor v0.2.1.30. This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. (Running on Darwin x86_64)

Aug 06 20:02:03.924 [notice] Bootstrapped 100%: Done.
Afterwards, I launched Polipo in a separate process:
Disabling disk cache: No such file or directory
Disabling local tree: No such file or directory
Established listening socket on port 8123.
This, in itself, is already weird, as Polipo, by default, is supposed to bind to port 8118 as opposed to 8123. So then, when I configure the preferences for my network card and specify the web proxy and secure web proxy, I specify localhost as the hostname and 8123 as the port. When I confirm and apply the config changes, I can access the web just fine through Safari (I'm visually impaired, and unfortunately can't use Firefox on the Mac due to the lack of screen reader support). When I open a website such as Google in Safari after applying the new settings, the site loads just fine. However, when I open check.torproject.org, I get a message saying that I'm not using for. Also, browsing to a site like whatismyip.org shows my own IP, not the IP of a Tor server. When I change my proxy settings to port 8118, however, it doesn't work at all - Safari reports that it can't connect to the proxy. So then, I tried quitting both Tor and Polipo services and then launched the Vidalia GUI. This then reported that Tor was running, and in fact, when I set up proxy connectivity again and set the port to 8118, it worked just fine. I then tried removing the /Applications/Vidalia.app folder, the /Library/Vidalia folder and the ~/.tor folders. Afterwards, I tried setting up everything once again, however the issue is still present. So, when I call both the Tor and Polipo services from Terminal, Polipo obviously binds to a wrong port and seems to accept and forward connections, but they are not routed through Tor and thus Polipo isn't working properly. Only when both services are launched through the Vidalia GUI, everything seems to be just fine. So, what do I need to do in order to get them to work from Terminal?
Thanks for any help!

Hi Jack,
thanks for the idea!
However, I'm really not sure if this really is the problem. After all, it actually works when Polipo is launched via the GUI, the problems only appear when I launch it from the command line. Also, Tor is set as the parent proxy in my Polipo config, but for some reason, it just doesn't work when I start them up from the shell. Any way I could maybe pinpoint the actual issue so that I can work on fixing it?

Hi Geoff,
yes? That was exactly the problem! I falsely assumed that Polipo would automatically read the config file from that directory, but that obviously wasn't right. Now it's also clear why Vidalia worked whereas my shell commands didn't, as Vidalia perhaps calls Polipo with the right parameters. Well, sorry for this - this probably happens when you try to use software that you don't fully understand! :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Designing a secure "Tor box" for safe web browsing? 
Hi all,
so, I've been browsing the web using Tor for some time now, and I have to say that, at least with the cir quid I am currently using, I'm quite impressed with the performance, especially since I'm only connected through a 3g ap at the moment! So, I've had a look around the Torproject site and reading up on how it all works and what safeguarding should be performed in order to stay secure. So, I was thinking, how could I get all the systems that are part of my own home network to access the web securely and anonymously? Well, I came up with the following idea, and since some of you guys may have tried this, was wondering if this would be practicable:
on my network, all devices are behind a hardware firewall that performs NAT and packet filtering for viruses and other malicious stuff (UTM). The firewall acts as the DHCP within the network, and its WAN port is connected to my router which only handles internet connections. So far for my current network topology. Now, I was thinking of adding another gateway here. My idea was to take an embedded PC (e.g. a Soekris box) and installing a distribution such as Debian on its memory. Then, a DHCP could first be set up on this box. Using iptables, network interface routing could be configured, so that traffic arriving at the LAN network interfaces would be routed to one exit point, the WAN interface. So, at this stage, the DHCP on the Debian machine would assign IPs to clients connected to the LAN ports, and all traffic arriving at these ports would be redirected to one port which would be the WAN. Now, this box could, for example, be connected in between the firewall and the router. So, the firewall would receive an IP from the Debian box, and all network clients would still be behind the firewall. So then, when a client wants to access the internet, it would first go through the firewall, from the firewall to the Debian box and from there to the router and the web. Now, the Debian box would have to route all connections through the Tor network. I guess Polipo could be set up on the Debian box so that it will route all outgoing connections through the Tor network. In this case, all traffic passing through the box would be anonymized on the fly. However, some other steps would have to be taken. For example, I guess it would be wise to implement functionality such as offered by the SSL Everywhere Firefox extension, so that SSL would automatically be enabled on as many sites as possible. Also, it probably would be better to configure Polipo to reject any Cookies, Java Applets, Flash and anything else that could compromise security. As such limitations would also limit "comfortable" browsing, I guess various modes could be designed, such as a safe mode (fully anonymized), a restrictive mode (not everything is blocked, thus potential security risks exist) and a non-restrictive mode (all traffic is routed through Tor, however no packet filtering is performed - most convenient but also most insecure). Also, both safe and restrictive mode could perform things such as browser-header obfuscation, geo-data obfuscation, etc. Sure, such concepts would probably take some time and work in order to make everything work. Therefore, I wondered if someone might be working on such a task already and if not, if this would be a project which would make sense, and which would be worth putting some effort into. I guess my idea probably isn't new to most people dealing with Tor and secure networking, but I'm wondering if such a platform already exists. I definitely will be working on this once I get back home, as I think such an undertake would be quite useful to me personally!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Designing a secure "Tor box" for safe web browsing? 
Hi Gozu-san,
thanks for the links! They seem like good starting points for such a project. Such a box would be, when designed and fully configured, a good and stable way for people wanting to give their machines secure www access. Other than the software config, I could also imagine certain hardware precautions that could be made. For example, such a device could, in theory, come with a static ROM that contains the software in a way which can't be altered. The dynamic info required to run Tor could then be stored in a RAM (e.g. directory / cirquit info, logs, etc) and would be discarded immediately once the device is disconnected from the power source. The advantage of such a setup would be that it wouldn't store more data than required for sure. However, I guess updating Tor, or any other packages, would be impossible in that case. Still, I do like the idea of having a black box that takes care of anon web resource access and privacy control. Guess I'll keep researching and working on this, and see what I come up with! If anyone would like to help, suggest ideas or thinks this would be total nonsense, please let me know! I'm new to working on such projects and have some general ideas at the moment, so this is also kind of exciting for me.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Automatic vulnerability scanning of Tor Network? 
Hi there,
you know, I'm definitely not someone deeply involved in the Tor project, its development, maintenance and all that. However, from my experience, I've always thought that everyone donating a relay or exit node to the network is seen as "potentially helpful" and not as a "potential security risk". In essence, the idea you just proposed would completely turn this around. No, I honestly don't want some outside individual to audit my security. If I want my security to be audited, I'm gonna do that all by myself - both from outside and from inside of my network. Also, one thing that makes Tor so great is its decentralized infrastructure. Sure, there are some databases that contain the IPs of at least all exit nodes, but there's no central way of shutting them down. So, what you want to do is to gather info on security vulnerabilities for all Tor nodes, and then store them in some kind of CENTRAL database, which would have to be inaccessible to the public (thus taking away any kind of transparency). Now, imagine that central database gets hacked and the sec assessments become accessible to a party with a hostile view on the Tor network. That party could then go ahead and launch targeted attacks on all kinds of security holes found in all nodes, thus making it easy to take out probably a large fraction of the Tor network.
Look, go ahead, take that idea and throw it in the trash. Even better, flush it down the toilet - because, to be honest, I think that even if you recycle that stuff, nothing good is ever gonna come out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mac OS X: how to make sure everything is going through 
Hi all,
I am using Mac OS X and running the Vidalia Bundle. For my network connection that connects me to the internet, I have the Polipo address and port configured as the Web proxy, Secure Web proxy and SOCKS proxy in the network preferences.
Now, this seems to have worked, as all of my browser's connections are now going through tor. However, there are some apps such as chat clients, email clients, etc. that have their own proxy settings, and those don't seem to be affected by my default system proxy preferences. Thus, even if the system is configured to use the proxy, it seems as if some apps bypass the settings unless they are explicitly configured to also use the proxy. Now, I was wondering, is there any way for me to make sure that apps can only establish an internet connection through Polipo, and cut off the "untorified" route to the web?
Please note, I am mostly using tor to bypass restrictions on my current network, such as blocked outgoing ports and content filters, rather than trying to cover up my identity. Thus, I'm not all that worried about security risks that could expose my identity, but rather looking for a way to freely access whatever I want on the internet.
Thanks for any advice!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Reliable server hosting company for Tor exits? 
Hi guys,
having used Tor for quite a while now and educated several people on how to use it to surf anonymously and enhancing privacy, I'm now at a point where I really would like to give back and make a contribution to the network by hosting a Tor exit node. Currently, I'm already running a Linux root server hosted by Hetzner Online in Germany. I've already been running a Tor relay on that for quite a while, but sadly had to find out that the server's IP subsequently got added to several EMail blacklists - despite the server only being a relay and not an actual exit node! Since I rely on that server for my day-to-day EMail communications, I thus had to shutdown the relay and kindly ask the DNSBl providers to remove me from their blacklists, which luckily they did.
However, like I said above, I still would like to contribute to the Tor network and set up an actual exit, and am willing to spend the money required to rent another dedicated machine for that purpose. But now, my problem really is... Where should I really host this server? After all, chances are someone will abuse my server's IP for whatever purposes, and I'm willing to deal with abuse notices and reply with all the nice texts about Tor provided by the EFF and the Tor project. However, I'd rather not want to deal with police officials storming into my home and temporarily arresting me for whatever reason. For that reason, I think hosting the Tor exit server at Hetzner in Germany really isn't the best option. Instead, I'd much rather choose a provider in a country with better privacy regulations, such as Sweden or possibly Holland. I've already been looking around for server hosters there and found some, however many of them prohibit the use of services like Tor on their servers.
So, I just wanted to take this as an opportunity to ask all of you Tor exit node hosters on here... Which hosting companies are you using for these purposes? Which of them have the greatest tolerance when dealing with abuse requests, and are possibly educated about Tor exits and their abuse potencial? Are there any that will protect my personal details such as name, address, etc. or will they all happily surrender to the authorities in case of any trouble and turn over that info to them?
Thanks a lot for any input on this topic, any help greatly appreciated! :-)

Hi Moritz,
thanks a lot for the reply and for your information!
Hmmm, I guess that is a good and valid point that you have there. Yes, I guess you're right - it probably would be much better for the Tor infrastructure if servers were spread out across several ISPs. However, like I said, I would also like to work with an ISP that is concerned with user privacy and won't take down a server or pass on my personal information to third parties whenever a slight sign of trouble arises. Like I said, I really don't mind dealing with abuse requests and explain to whoever is complaining that this is a Tor exit node, what Tor is all about, how it works, etc. The only thing that I really don't want to have to face would be serious trouble with the police or other authorities - which perhaps is also the case since I've never really been in such trouble and don't know what the process would look like when dealing with legal officials which most likely won't be too experienced in terms of Tor-like infrastructures. Is there a chance that if I decide to setup a Tor node I'll get by without any such incidents?
That is very interesting and a very good approach in deed! I think if I really take the plunge and set up a Tor node, I will most likely do the same. Also, thanks a lot for pointing out these templates - I'll definitely make sure to check them out!
Haha, no, I definitely don't like giving up at all, so that should be fine! :-) Well, if you'd like to get in touch and offer some advice, I'd definitely be very thankful for that! So, feel free to drop me a line off-list if you like, so we can discuss everything more in depth and get things up and running! Now, I'm not sure where you're based and what languages you speak, but in case you speak German as well, feel free to contact me in either English or German, whatever works best for you! :-)
Thanks, keep up the great work!

Hi Eugen,
Ah, yes, that's true - thanks a lot for pointing that out to me, as I completely forgot about this! Well, I guess I could get myself a second IP in that case and continue running it as a relay... But in that case, I think I'd still want to designate a separate server as the actual Tor exit, just in case something really terrible happens and the machine gets taken down temporarily. But yes, thanks a lot for bringing that to my mind!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Where can I get Tor without the browser? 
Hello all,
I just visited the Tor website, since I wanted to download the latest version for Mac OS. Well, I was hoping to find a Tor + Polipo Bundle without anything else, but it looks like those have been abandoned sadly, all I could find was the Tor Browser portable app.
As I'm completely blind, I access my computer using the built-in VoiceOver screen reader for Mac OS. My understanding is that the Tor Browser is based on Firefox. Since Firefox unfortunately is completely inaccessible to me on the Mac, the same thing goes for the Tor Browser. On earlier versions of Tor and Polipo, I would simply download it, install the program package, then access the contents of the application bundle, edit the config files for Tor and Polipo and then launch Tor through the command line, after which I could then configure my own programs to use either Polipo or Tor directly. With the new approach, this seems to be much harder as it seems like Tor + Polipo, or just a plain Tor binary can no longer be downloaded for Mac OS, which, as it seems, means less flexibility. I guess I could just grab the source and compile it myself, but I guess one would have to download XCode to do this on a Mac - and unfortunately I just don't have the data capacity for such a huge download?
Am I just missing something here, or is there really no other wway of obtaining a 'plain' binary of Tor for Mac OS?
Many thanks for any help!

Hi Roger,
I'll give that another look. However, I've already checked and wasn't able to find any config files for Tor, not exactly sure where those went just yet?
Yes, I know that? I really would like to use Tor browser, but the problem really is that it's completely inaccessible, and even if I contacted the Tor Browser devs there most likely won't be any easy way of fixing that for them. The problem really is that the Firefox user interface wasn't programmed with multi-platform accessibility in mind, and so under Mac OS it's just not possible for the screen reader to interface with the UI properly and read back the relevant information to me. I know Firefox is supposedly accessible on Linux - but then Linux distributions have other accessibility-related hickups that make migrating very impracticable. However, this might not be too much of an issue for me since I never used to use Tor all that much for web browsing, but more for other programs and for running a Tor relay in the past.

@_subject: [tor-talk] DNS provider that does not hijack failures 
Hi Sebastian and all,
thanks for all the great feedback and responses!
Honestly I think that for the purposes of my initial question, taking the actions of NSA into account is going a bit too far. No one really knows what they are and aren't capable of - and while speculation is nice, this isn't Dan Brown's 'Digital Fortress', this is reality. Of course, it's disputable whether the reality is scarier than 'Digital Fortress', but I guess that's a whole different topic.
Now this is interesting? When I read the 'Chaos Computer Club' part, I was like 'Yes, perhaps this is what I should use as long as it works reliably'. But why? Maybe it's because I'm German and I've read and heard about the Chaos Computer Club, maybe it's because I listen to their radio program every time it airs (last Thursday of every month). Google can give me a privacy policy, I will read it and not believe half of it. The Chaos Computer Club can give me an IP for a DNS server it operates, and my first instinct will be that it's great although I've never even seen a reference to a privacy policy for their DNS service.
This, I guess, just shows some ISPs trigger some instinctive feelings, good or bad, that may not even be justified?

Hi all,
just setup my tor node and got the following log entries after a few minutes:
May 30 22:37:26 home Tor[3107]: Your DNS provider gave an answer for "skwpnmuq.com", which is not supposed to exist. Apparently they are hijacking DNS failures. Trying to correct for this. We've noticed 1 possibly bad address so far.
May 30 22:37:26 home Tor[3107]: Your DNS provider has given "67.215.65.132" as an answer for 8 different invalid addresses. Apparently they are hijacking DNS failures. I'll try to correct for this by treating future occurrences of "67.215.65.132" as 'not found'.
We use OpenDNS on our network, and I know they provide an info page if someone attempts to browse to a non-existant address. This isn't a big issue normally, but I can see how it's a problem with Tor. Thus, I'd like to use a different DNS service for my node and just put this in my resolv.conf to fix this.
However, I'm not sure about which DNS provider would be best here, so any help with that would be greatly appreciated!
Many thanks,

Hi Joe and Sean,
thanks a lot for your suggestions and discussion!
I have to say Google DNS really isn't an option for me, because I simply don't trust Google. Even if they do have a decent privacy policy for their DNS service, they do store geographic information which I think is unacceptable for a DNS provider. I've considered running my own DNS resolver, however the problem is that I use a Soekris Net6501 embedded PC as my home server which is also running the Tor node, and I think a DNS resolver would simply cause too much overheat on this box.
Thanks a lot though, might have to consider other options if there aren't any other suggestions!
