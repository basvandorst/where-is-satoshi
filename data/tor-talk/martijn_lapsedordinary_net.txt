Isn't the fact that mobile phones exist - and thus employees don't
depend on their employer's Internet connection during working hours - a
reason why companies blocking Tor isn't too big a deal?
I know companies that have a separate WiFi network in the building, not
connected to the corporate network, that employees can use to get a good
connection on their mobile devices (or personal laptops). They could use
Tor or VPNs too.
A company that blocks Tor because it's worried its employees are up to
no good should change the way it views its employees. A company overly
worried about employees using Tor to exfiltrate sensitive data should
consider blocking the whole of the Internet, or - more realisticly -
store sensitive data in a way that access is restricted to those that
really need it.
But a company that blocks Tor because, as IBM puts it, a lot of
malicious actors use Tor is making a sensible security decision.

Ouch. I stand corrected. I had missed that bit - I had only skimmed
through the paper last week - and it does explicitly say that the Tor
Project website should be blocked. It even suggests "disciplinary
action" should be taken if people try to access the site. Wow.

There's also the simple fact that "an executable with a Tor client built
in" is more likely than not malicious: a lot of modern malware uses Tor
for C&C.
Things could be worse - though I'm not sure if this happens - if malware
downloaded the legitimate tor.exe on the side.
Have you reached out to AV vendors and see if this issue could be
solved? They might be willing to whitelist the executable.
(FYI, I pinged someone at Panda about this particular issue and they'd
look into it.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fixing the problem of sending email from Tor: Proof 
So if I understand you correctly, you mean the following two problems:
a) using Tor to connect to a third-party provider (Gmail etc) won't
always work as the connection is sometimes blocked;
b) using Tor to connect to the recipient's mail server on port 25, if
you find an exit node that allows you to do so, will often result in the
connection being blocked, because spammers use the same exit node as
well, resulting in blacklisting?
Your solution, as I understand it, is for Tor exit nodes that allow
outgoing connections on email ports to require a proof-of-work from the
client, to prevent spammers from abusing it.
A few thoughts:
* Proof-of-work to combat spam is an old idea, which many people believe
doesn't work, because spammers do have huge resources.[1] This may be
less of an issue here as senders may be willing to do a lot more work,
given that they explicitly choose to be behind work.
* Like it or loathe it, IP addresses play a very important part in
today's email infrastructure. To achieve good delivery rates, it is
advisable not to change IP addresses too often. With Tor, you'd be
changing them all the time.
* IP addresses aren't the only part of email that can be traced to you.
Domains can as well. That is worth keeping in mind here as well. (As for
DKIM, in theory this would allow mail servers to ignore the IP address
and just look at the domain. In practise I doubt any mail server does,
if only because they know the IP address much earlier during the SMTP
* This would essentially require the exit node to perform a
man-in-the-middle, at least on the level of meta-data, as it would have
to be able to distinguish between you sending 1000 short emails to
example.com users and you sending one very large email to an example.com
The latter still applies if you merely want to submit email to a mail
server that performs the delivery for you, rather than directly connect
to the recipient's mail server.
As for the idea of a "Per Port Exit OutBoundAddress", it is good to know
there are other reasons why people might want to prevent certain IP
addresses from sending email, not just spam: (perceived) abuse,
censorship etc. Introducing such a single point of failure sounds like a
bad idea.

That's an interesting paper (I wasn't aware of it and I like their
approach; thanks for sharing) but I don't think its conclusions
contractict that quote from Ross Anderson's blog post. That merely
states that the NSA doesn't have a very fast way to break RSA-1024.
It is well possible that they are using an approach similar to the one
Bernstein and Lange describe to crack the RSA-1024 private keys of
prime targets.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Elliptic Curve Crypto and the NSA 
I agree with this statement, though I believe in this case people aren't
suspecting a backdoor but a weakness in ECC that the NSA has found and
that they are worried someone else will find (or possibly has found
already) as well. That's possible, but I consider it extremely unlikely.

Perhaps you're on a secret mission somewhere and want to log into
Facebook, without letting even Facebook know where you are.
Perhaps you can't access Facebook from where you are, but can access
Perhaps neither applies to you, but you just want to make sure those
people to whom it does apply don't stand out.
Perhaps you think all Internet traffic should use onion routing.
Perhaps there's another reason for using it that you don't want to
share, which should be fine: one shouldn't generally have to explain why
one uses Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] CloudFlare blog post 
CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince just posted this blog post
    which I think is worth a read for people on this list.
TL;DR: CloudFlare is serving CAPTHAs to Tor users not by design but as a
consequence of the way their IP reputation system works. CloudFlare is
willing to help, for example by having the CAPTCHA moved to the client
side and by making it easier for their customers to register .onion
NB I'm not affiliated with CloudFlare in any way. I too have been
frustrated by their CAPTCHAs.
