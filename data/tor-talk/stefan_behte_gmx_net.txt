@_subject: tor-ctrl v1 - setting bandwidthrate from commandline via controlport 
I'm sorry to write again, but the previous post somehow became a
follow-up to another post and I'm not sure that this got much (any?!)
I'd like to present a tool which was said to be wanted by some people
running servers ( -> nr. 3)  - so I
wrote it.
tor-ctrl is a general-purpose commandline tool for executing commands on
a tor server via the controlport. I regard it as kind of "interface"
between the tor controller interface and the commandline.
It's written in BASH and uses just telnet/xxd (the last one only when
using control_auth_cookie), so there is no need for a bulky java/python
Here is an example of what you can do with it:
For setting the bandwidth for specific times of the day, I suggest
calling tor-ctrl via cron, e.g.:
0 22 * * * /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"
0 7 * * *  /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=100kb"
This would set the bandwidth to 100kb at 07:00 and to 1mb at 22:00.
You can use notations like 1mb, 1kb or the number of bytes.
In order to do other "magic", you should read
I also created a download-page for the tool: Direct link: If it's down, please try again later (I had some problems with my ISP
Please send me some feedback, ideas and (most important!) bug reports!
Best regards,

Hash: SHA1
Dropping support might be a good idea then.
No. 0.9.8f!
Sounds OK.
