Please do a Wireshark (or TCPDUMP) of your Tor packages. Then you may see where are there going out from.
Things to keep in mind: a VPN should be used for connecting to a set of addresses only. It can not be your main internet connection, because it needs to use your internet connection to go out.

Hi Andrew
Issue is not isolation from other processes, issue is that the Flash player might communicate your IP and other data to some third party (who may be the video host service or not)

Just imagine that your flash app is programmed such that it connects to some server and that server gives the user's visible address. That is going out of the browser-managed connections, so it is using your real connection, so now the flash app knows your public (either real or proxyed) IP and can tell to the bad guys.
No alternative can avoid such programming if it tries to have the complete flash API.
