For me, a more basic question is whether installing extensions from a fresh Tor installed is (sufficiently) safe. I do not know the details of the process but it probably involves some HTTPS connections to addons.mozilla.org. If the exit node can perform MITM attacks on SSL you may end up installing something unwanted. Could the initial setup be made safer, for instance by storing digests of addons.mozilla.org certificate in Tor bundles at build time and *warn* if they do not match (like a specialized Certificate Patrol would do)? Is it already addressed in Firefox?

It would be nice to have a place describing how to contribute, clearly linked from the top of the "Volunteer" page:
- How to checkout the code (may sound ridiculous but all repository hosting services from google code to bitbucket and github print the command required to clone a particular project on their homepage or source page)
- I have found a bug, what should I do? (aka "Trac bug search page is daunting")
- I have fixed a registered bug, what should I do?
- I have implemented a cool feature, what should I do, patchbomb tor-dev?
- Coding conventions, prerequisites (test should pass? anything else?)
FWIW, I would have patchbombed tor-dev mailing list :-)
