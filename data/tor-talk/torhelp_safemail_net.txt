@_subject: New Tor Relay: Help!!!!! 
Hello all.
I just upgraded my internet speed and have been running a Tor Relay for around two days or so.
I have set up 2-3 tor relays before so I understand (I think) how to set one up.
Here's the problem:
In the past two days, Vidalia says I've received 200MBs of data and sent around 500MBs of data. My relay has almost NO traffic compared to the other relays I've had.
I'm supposed to have upwards of 3MBS up and .73 MBs down. In Vadalia, I have the "Bandwidth Limits" set to 512 Kbps.
Why is there almost no traffic? Please HELP!!!!
Here's some other info:
Relay Name: Revvvolution
Port Forwarding: 443, 9030
NOT an exit relay.
Here's the log file output:

Can you explain the DNs hijacking thing? I don't understand what that means/the implications.
I guess I'll wait a little longer before freaking out then... It's just the last two Tor relays I set up, within 3-4 hours of being online, they were operating at max capacity... To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

Thanks for all the responses.
Since my node is not an exit node, does that really matter that my ISP is hijacking DNS requests? Does anyone know how that can effect my non-exit node?
