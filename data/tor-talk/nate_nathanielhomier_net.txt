@_subject: New user question about Directory mirroring & bittorent 
Hello all.  My name is Nate.
I just started using tor as a client and server.  I have 2 questions that I can't find an answer to in the wiki and docs.  I have my BandwidthRate, BandwidthBurst set to 50KB as my ADSL line is 500KB down and 90KB up.
"Uncomment this to mirror the directory for others (please do)"  This line seems to make me feel guilty about asking if it's okay to not mirror the dir in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage.  Only to keep my line responsive.  Basically I just want to serve the tor users without mirroring the dir.  I suppose if you really need the help I could keep it uncommented But I would rather not.  So okay to comment out?
Also I want to continue using my torrent client Azureus.  Obviously not on the tor network.  How well do the tor server and torrent play together concerning bandwidth.  Would I need to adjust the BandwidthRate, BandwidthBurst of 50KB down some to make adjustments for torrent.  I plan on reducing the upload bandwidth for torrent to something like 10KB to 20KB down from the current 56.7KB now and the download rate would  get a limit of 200KB maybe more maybe less depending on what you guys say.
Any advice on how to carve up my bandwidth for Tor, torrent, Web browser, E-Mail would be greatly appreciated.
Tor version: 0.1.0.16-1~breezy.1
500KB down
90KB up

Thanks for the answers and suggestions.
If I put in MaxAdvertisedBandwidth what does this do exactly.  I had assumed that tor already broadcast your BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst settings.  The docs don't really explain in a way I can understand clearly.  So I am guessing the MaxAdvertisedBandwidth setting will broadcast and the other 2 are local to your computer.
On my ADSL line my ISP does no filtering except port 25 and no throttling and no caps.  So I don't need to worry about max bandwidth.  I decided to change BandwidthRate to 30KB and BandwidthBurst to 40KB.  As for Azureus I will change it to 25KB up.  That will leave me 25KB total leftover up.  I use PPPOE and that has a bit more overhead for ADSL lines although I don't know about cable modem lines.
