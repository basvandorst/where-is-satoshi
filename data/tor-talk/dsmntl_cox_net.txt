:    If you change the control port in the torrc file, you also :have to change it in the TorCP GUI.  Then restart TorCP.
So the "ORPort" in torrc and the "Control Port" in the GUI should be the
same port?  I set them both to 7001, restarted--the onion had a red/white
check on it for a sec, then it went back to an onion with no check.  I
tested the browser and no connection.  Or did I misunderstand?

:ORPort is the port on which Tor listens for new OR connections :(this is the Tor data plane).
Ok, that's how I thought it was before Ashton responded.  So what is Ashton
telling me I did wrong?
As it stands now:
1.  OR port set to "ORPort 8001" in torrc and uncommented.
2.  Control port set to 9051 in torrc, and now uncommented.
3.  GUI Control port set to 9051.
4.  Nickname set to "Nickname Eraserhead" in torrc.
5.  FW set to accept inbound connections on tcp 8001.
Still it doesn't work.
:ControlPort is the port on which Tor listens for new :controller connections (e.g. connections from TorCP).
:I believe that the socket accepting OR connections binds to :0.0.0.0 by default, in which case it MUST NOT have the same :value as ControlPort.
:Also, the ControlPort specified in torrc MUST match what TorCP :thinks that it is.

:I do not know anything about Windows or TorCP, but I think :that this question will be enlightening: does replacing the :torrc file with the original torrc restore Tor to working order?
Yes, commenting out the inbound port and nickname restores tor to working
order.  I don't get it.
In my prior post, I should have stated I poked a hole in my fw in allow
inbound tcp connections to a semi-random port.
Any help is appreciated.
