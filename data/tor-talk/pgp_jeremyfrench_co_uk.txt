As others have said, yes.
You have two things to think about, is it ok to leave Pi running 24/7? And is it secure?
I have had my pi on pretty much constantly since I bought it. It dosn't get paticularly hot, but having it in a case and away from ignition sources is probably a good idea.
As for security that is more tricky. By operating a TOR realay it is possible that you may become a target for the NSA to try and compramize on top of the normal hack attempts you will get with any open ports. So it is best to lock down and monitor. If you are running a compramized relay you are not really helping the TOR project, IMHO.
Nothing much.

Yes I have looked into it. It can be a bit tricky to set up. But seems to work well enough once it is set up. P2P email over TOR is actually quite a neat solution, as you do away with any central weak spot. Cables also randomizes the times that it retries to send to try and cut down on leaks due to timing information.
I have a how to on setting up on Arch Linux here
