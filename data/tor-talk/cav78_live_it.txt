Hallo everybody.
I would like to know if it's necessary to install or configure a web proxy (privoxy or polipo) with Tor Browser Bundle 3.6.3 in order to have more privacy or to prevent Dns leaks.
 (a software for Android) includes Polipo, but I don't see it in Tor Browser. Is it really important or we can do without it? Sorry for my english if it's not so perfect. Bye.
