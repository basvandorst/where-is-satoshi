Yes, i guess it can. But it wouldn't address the security challenge of
integrating GM. If only for a temporary youtube fix, is it really worth it?
I haven't checked the project in the last couple years, yet in the past GM
had to deal with significant security issues.
As so many projects it grew from a few hacks and ended much wider than ever
intended, with the usual design and coding scars. But the main obstacle was
that it introduced a new level of privilege between embedded javascript and
chrome code, which was not intended to exist in firefox and impossible to
enforce in pure javascript. It was long the case that, although relatively
safe when used properly, it could quickly be used in unsafe ways -- even in
good faith.
I guess it's gotten better since?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor client version statistics 
I'm not sure if you guys are just talking about clients version numbers, or
different client implementations?
Anyway, looking into a 2006 NSA document about Tor [1], one can read (page
8) that some client identifying information may be found in the issuer and
subject portions of X.509 certificates. Is this still the case today?
The NSA built its own implementation of a Tor client lib (named MJOLNIR),
which is claimed to play around with these fields as a way to conceal it's
generating Tor TCP traffic. Yet, in doing so, it seems to advertise to the
OR that it's not a standard Tor client?
