@_subject: [tor-talk] HiddenServices: calculating .onion address with private 
I found a short info (somewhere on Tor's GitHub account) about
"calculating" .onion address when I have private key but I was not able
to implement a short code example with perl/php/bash.
I know I could just throw the private key in
this without Tor.
I tried something like this on the shell but the result is always wrong:
$ openssl rsa -outform DER -in "private.key.file" 2>/dev/null  | \
sha1sum -b | awk '{ print $1 }' | head -c 20 | \
perl -MMIME::Base32=RFC -e 'print lc(MIME::Base32::encode())' |\
head -c 16
Someone smarter with a better idea?

well ... I saw it in a repository on Github and I thought
that it was official Tor's repository. I obvisouly made a
mistake ;-).
