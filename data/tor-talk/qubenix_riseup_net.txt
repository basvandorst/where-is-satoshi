Can you ask them to fix their site so I don't have to do the cloudflare
captchas? You seem to know a lot about them. Maybe you got contacts.

@_subject: [tor-talk] comparison of Tor and Kovri in regards to 
Eugen Leitl:
Kovri is just a new implementation of i2p that anonimal is working on
and Monero intends to use, not a fork of the i2p project. It still is
using the existing i2p network.
I agree.
I think it's a fact that Tor is more battle tested and thus anti-fragile
than i2p, but I could be wrong. I'm also interested in what the list has
to say.

@_subject: [tor-talk] should windows apps leave tor running 
Hi all! :)
I would love to be enlightened about a Windows applications best
practice in regards to tor.exe. First, a little background.
There's a Bitcoin wallet, Wasabi[1], that is privacy and security
focused. The wallet allows users to do coinjoin transactions with other
random users, coordination is done on a central server via an onion.
Currently the lead dev of the project, nopara73, is under the impression
that it is a good idea to leave tor.exe running on Windows users
computers even after the wallet is closed[2]. He feels this will help to
prevent some types of timing/correlation attacks.
I installed a Windows7 VM and installed TBB, and I see that tor.exe is
killed with the browser. Also I read the best practices for Tor friendly
apps[3], where it says to start tor with each process.
What is the professional opinion on this?
Thank you for reading.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Reuters blocking Tor users? 
I've notice over (at least) the past few days that while using tbb all
links to Reuters that I follow end up on a "Page not found". Even
 shows it. This is with or without scripts allowed.
Have others noticed this? Is this a known thing that Reuters does, or
something new?
Thanks for reading.
