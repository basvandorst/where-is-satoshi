@_subject: Broken DNS 
I followed a link here with the title Earthlink's "broken DNS affecting Tor nodes".
Maybe someone here could answer these questions about
broken DNS.
If you check the two IP's 216.154.211.104 and 65.74.151.220 they show broken DNS.
If you check at Robtex
you find eorrors on both IP's.
The reverse of the host name static-65-74-151-220.ey01.engineyard.com was found one time now
220.151.74.65.static.ey01.engineyard.com as the host name.
I can use  agoracom.com and
220.175.74.65.static.ey01.engineyard.com to sign in.
Before I could sign in at static-65-74-151-220.ey01.engineyard.com .
The DNS looks like it is still broken.
What problems could this cause for a client using this site ?
Have the DNS records been compromised because the
servers have been hacked into ?
