You need more mathematics training, grasshopper.  Almost all integers
have that property (or all, if you don't halt upon reaching 1).  Not
to mention that your first transformations treat large sets of keys
as identical in a most dreadful manner.
I suggest you go find your nearest public library and read some more
about information theory, number theory, and mathematical logic so
that you can more accurately evaluate the effective salience of
these notions.  Particularly look up properties of arithmetic, basic
properties of functions and relations, the pigeonhole principle, and
the exponential relationship between string length and number of possible
strings, and implications and surrounding theory thereof.  (Too bad I
don't have a more concrete suggested reading list immediately available...)

(Except zero, because I was originally thinking of positive naturals
and got it mixed up in editing.  Wow, that's embarrassing.)
(Ahem.  Anyway, enough of that.)

I doubt this list will give you the kind of support you need.  You might
want to ask the people who make your CMS instead, as they'll have a somewhat
better idea what kind of webserver configuration to use.  My guess is your
CMS or webserver is expecting to use a single canonical hostname so having
two addresses is confusing it into rendering broken links, but you cannot
expect "please help me with my issue" to yield good results while providing
no details about your configuration.
And please, in the future, don't jam reposts in by replying in completely
unrelated threads.  It's rude.

@_subject: [tor-talk] darkweb-everywhere - was: Using HTTPS Everywhere to 
For HTML resources, the obvious thing to use would be link
relations[1,2] (using the  tag).  The Link HTTP header has
sometimes been used to represent the same semantics for non-HTML
resources.  Existing relations that are close in meaning:
  - "alternate" seems similar, though it's notionally for referring to
    alternate _representations_ rather than alternate _locations_.
    (The exact distinction isn't entirely clear, but the intent seems
    to exclude cases like this.)
  - "canonical" asserts a "preferred" version/location, which isn't
    quite what's wanted here.  A weaker form of "canonical" would be
    useful.
  - "duplicate" asserts that the representations are exactly identical,
    which as the IANA listing describes makes no sense for dynamic
    content, so that's not directly useful here.
Out of curiosity, has this been taken up with any of the relevant
working groups?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Once again: window size 
To oversimplify:
A website can learn your window size because it needs to draw the page
differently.  If two users used different window sizes, the website could
distinguish them: if you use 800x600, and I use 1024x768, then it knows
that someone visiting at 800x600 might be you and not me.  That is less
anonymous.  So Tor Browser needs to use the same window size for all users.
To make the size the same, it changes the size when you open a new window.
It doesn't make the window that size at the beginning because it's
more difficult to make that work and because changing the size is good
enough.  I do not know why you see a delay of one second.
Does that help?

Yes, it does potentially mean that.  It is not a complete loss, and may not
_directly_ reveal any other details, but it adds a unique element.  If websites or
exit nodes or spies see more than one page load using your monitor resolution and
not the Tor Browser default size, they can guess that those are more likely to be
the same person.  And if you reveal personal information on one website using an
unusual window size, and then access another website the same way, they can work
together to guess that it was you who did the second access.  If you access the
websites using an insecure channel (such as plain HTTP and not always HTTPS),
anyone who can observe the traffic from your exit nodes can also guess.
The specific analysis depends on your specific situation and what kind of anonymity
you need.  But you should use the default window size if you can.  Of course, you
should also be careful in all other ways.
It is probably just while the Firefox part of the software is creating the
window, before the Tor Browser part can resize it.  Possibly on a faster
computer there is very little delay.  I don't have a copy of Tor Browser with me,
unfortunately.  How fast is your CPU?  How much RAM do you have?
(Developers: is that a known potential race condition vs the user beginning input?
I'm guessing the window hook from the design draft doesn't allow blocking the UI.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unexpected SMTP 
Sorry, I can't quite tell what configuration this is you're talking about.
Did you mean: "I run a Web hosting service accessible primarily or only
via Tor; outgoing traffic is routed via Tor as well, and I expected this
to implicitly block all outgoing email, but many users run dynamic websites
with backend code that sends email anyway, which is now being insecurely
routed"?  (If so, it would have been nice if you'd mentioned that
If you actually need to _block_ email, you need to actually block it, not
rely on "no exit would ever accept this connection" (which you have already
found out).
If your users want to be able to run all the Cool New Web Applications that
rely on the open Internet in all the popular ways, but then also run them
behind Tor and not get weirdly hosed at random, that's... less than practical
without an awful lot of mediating work (as you also probably know).  The sets
of prevailing assumptions are too incompatible.
As far as I know, the Tor network and Tor project set no global hard policy
on where exit nodes are allowed to exit; the Tor project provides defaults
and some sets of suggested rules, but each node can override this however
they want.  (For instance, allowing exit to the SMTP relay port at a specific
set of servers known to handle this well could be entirely reasonable.  The
distinction between SMTP relay and SMTP submission ports may also be relevant,
depending on what your users are seeing.)
