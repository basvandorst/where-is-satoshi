Truecrypt works nicely on USB keys.  I haven't tried using it yet under
a bootable Linux install on a USB key, though I know of one such distro
(Puppy Linux) that uses AES encryption on an optional basis to encrypt a
persistent datastore on a USB key if you configure it to do so.
It would probably have to be stripped down a lot, but XAMPP might be
someplace to start:
Also, Puppy Linux has its own web server that is complex enough to run a
small wiki as a personal tool.  This might be usable for what you speak of.
I haven't had the time lately to play with anything else, but when I do
I'll write it up.

I've been using Enigmail and GnuPG for a couple of years and they've
always done right by me.  You really need to configure Enigmail before
using it (as if that needs to be said).  At the very least, you'll need
to have generated a public keypair and linked the public key to the
account in Thunderbird (Edit -> Account Settings ->  ->
OpenPGP Security -> check "Enable OpenPGP support", "Use specific
OpenPGP key ID", choose your public key).
At a minimum I would recommend checking both options for signing
outgoing messages.  Enigmail lets you use PGP/MIME for outgoing mail,
but I've had enough trouble with it (especially sending messages to
mailing lists) that I really don't recommend it.

Those are all excellent points.  My question is what the implications
of the following are insofar as this analysis is concerned:
How Tor picks nodes out of the set of all known Tor nodes:
How Tor avoids picking sibling nodes when charting a path through the
Tor detecting siblings:
As I understand it, Tor nodes know IP addresses one up and one down in
a circuit.  I haven't read through the Tor codebase in a while (two or
three years), so my question is this: Does Tor apply the same family
avoidance check when picking nodes to avoid routing traffic through,
say, two nodes on the same /16?  In other words, would Tor do this:
192.168.1.23  ->  172.16.23.93  ->  10.0.61.44
..or would this be a possible scenario:
192.168.1.23  ->  172.16.23.93  ->  192.168.88.77

So, seeing as how this is the case (verified from the Git repo for

"Control X number of /'s" attack against users of the Tor network is.
 It stands to reason that of all of the /24's that make up a
particular /16, only one IP address in that entire space might be
utilized for a given circuit.  That suggests that an attacker won't
get nearly as much information with this attack as it seems.  It's

on my machine shows that it's configured to use a SOCKS5 proxy server

Tor running as a daemon.
Running tcpdump on my system (tcpdump -i lo -s 0 -v -X -n port 9050)

localhost:9050 on startup when it tries to access
check.torproject.org, so it's ignoring my copy of Polipo.  That said,

In 1999 and 1998 the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (psc.edu) was
home to three Cray supercomputers (Mario (XMP), Jaromir (YMP), and an
unnamed third that they were beta testing for Cray at the time).  They
were heating the entire complex with the waste heat from those three
Crays, and still venting plenty of heated air to keep everything from
melting down (everything else they had in the data center, from x86
servers to a couple of VAXen acting as front ends, as I recall).  The
infrastructure for supercomputing is immense, and very visible in the
sense of taking up a lot of space as well as power requirements.
Those facilities would stick out a country mile, and should be fairly
easy to spot, leading to more focused speculation if nothing else.
I read in a couple of articles that No Such Agency has their own chip
foundry someplace.  It seems reasonable to wonder out loud if they do
not have ASIC attacks against some cryptosystems (does anyone else
remember Deep Crack?) implemented.  Perhaps all of the NSA's vaunted
supercomputing power takes the form of racks and racks of servers with
custom ASICs implementing those attacks instead of massively parallel
architectures of general purpose computers running software attacks.

nor response at all are considered equally useful validations of said
theory.  If one makes the basic assumption that there is a conspiracy,
one immediately assumes that anything said by the subjects of the
conspiracy theory is false and meant to mislead.  If someone not
directly associated with the conspiracy theory says anything, they
were duped by the conspiracy so what they say cannot be trusted
either.  If the subjects of the conspiracy theory say nothing, that is

Hash: SHA512
I realized that too late; thank you for pointing that out.
I've been thinking a bit about this lately, and I think it might be
A while back I chanced across a description of how Richard Stallman
browses the Net much of the time.  He uses a Perl script which is
executed by Postfix via an e-mail alias.  If the sender's e-mail
address matches one hardcoded in the config file, it parses the e-mail
for URLs to grab and then uses LWP::UserAgent to download the URL and
e-mail it back to the script's owner.
The Git repo with the implementation:
So... I've been toying with this idea but haven't had time to sit down
and implement it yet:
It would be possible to write a relatively simple utility that runs as
a hidden service; perhaps on the user's (virtual) machine, perhaps on
a known Tor hidden service node.  Perhaps it doesn't use a hidden
service for itself but only listens on the loopback interface on a
high port, and the user connects to  from within
the TBB.  Perhaps any of those options, dependent upon a command line
switch or configuration file setting.  The user connects to the
application and types or pastes a URL into a field.  The utility
accepts the URL, verifies that it's a well formed URL, and records it
internally, perhaps in a queue.  Every once in a while on a
pseudorandom basis (computers, 'true' randomness, we've all seen the
mailing list threads) the utility wakes up, picks the oldest URL in
its queue out, and tries to download whatever it points to through the
Tor network.
If it successfully acquires an HTML page it could then attempt to
parse it (using something like Beautiful Soup, maybe) to verify that
it was a fully downloaded and validated HTML page.  It would also pick
through the parsed tags for things like CSS or images, construct URLs
to download them using the original URL (if no full URLs to them are
in the HTML), and add them to the queue of things to get.  It doesn't
seem unreasonable to rewrite the HTML to make links to those
additional resources local instead of remote (./css/foo.css instead of
css/foo.css) so the additional files downloaded would be referenced by
the browser.  It also doesn't seem unreasonable that a particular
instance of this utility could be configured to ignore certain kinds
of resources (no .js files, no images, no CSS files) and snip tags
that reference them from the HTML entirely.  When the resources for
the page in question are fully downloaded (none are left in the queue)
the user is alerted somehow (which suggests a personal application but
there are other ways of notifying users).
The timeframe in which an entire page could be downloaded could be
extremely long, from seconds between requests, to requiring a new
circuit for each request, to even weeks or months to grab an entire page.
I don't know if such a thing could be written as a distributed
application (lots of instances of this utility spread across a
percentage of the Tor network keeping each other appraised of bits and
pieces of web pages to download and send someplace).  I'll admit that
I've never tried to write such a thing before.  The security profile
of such a thing would certainly be a concern.
Representing each page and its resources in memory would take a little
doing but is far from impossible.  Depending on the user's threat
model it may not be desirable to cache the page+resources on disk
(holding them in RAM but making them accessible to the web browser,
say, with a simple HTTP server listening on the loopback on a high
port (I'm thinking instead of  the user would
access  or the user may be
comfortable with creating a subdirectory to hold the resources of a
single page.  This is the technique that Scrapbook uses, and being
workable aside seems very easy to implement:
A problem that would probably arise is Tor circuits dropping at odd
intervals due to the phase of the moon, Oglogoth grinding its teeth,
sunspots, or whatever and the connection timing out or dropping.  I'm
not sure how to handle this yet.  Another potential problem is a user
browsing a slowly downloaded page and clicking a link, which the
browser would then jump directly to and avoiding slow-download
entirely.  Warn the user this will happen?  Rewrite or remove the
links?  I'm not sure yet what the Right Thing To Do(tm) would be.
There are undoubtedly other gotchas that I haven't thought of or run
into yet which others will notice immediately.
