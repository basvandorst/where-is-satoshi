@_subject: [tor-talk] Half-solution to CF captcha problem 
Hello everyone, I have some tips regarding bypassing Cloudflare captchas. Sometimes it actually helps just by changing the Tor circuit. In the new TBB version 8 the circuit display is on the address bar information section, you know where the favicon, the https status etc is located. Click on it to see the circuit path, and try changing it a few times. It actually works sometimes, of course there are still those pesky websites that insist you solve the CAPTCHA. What do you do now? Well, you can of course view the site/article/whatever in the internet archive wayback machine! Choose the latest snapshot and view the page that way.
I'm not sure how many of you have figured this out, if you come across the CF block, don't give up! Try these above methods.
