@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on Plug PC running Arch 
I'm trying to get Tor running on a plug computer (used to be a Pogo
Plug) that's running Arch Linux ARM on it. I'm SSH-ing to it from my
laptop as it doesn't have video out.
I'm just having some trouble figuring this out. Here's what I'm using
for instructions: whenever I enter "# /etc/rc.d/tor start" I just get a busy signal.
I'd like to run a bridge relay, or contribute in whatever way I can.
It would be awesome if you could help.
