What is " and is it a scam clone website serving trojaned
copies of Tor and TBB?
I always thought the Tor website is only  but today I see a
link to the .us site, with no explanation of what's the relation to .org and
why on earth something like that would exist. Both sites use different web
hosts, different SSL certificates, but serve seemingly exactly the same content
(or not?...). Seems fishy to me.
If this .us domain is indeed controlled by the Tor project, the ONLY correct
decision is to set up "HTTP 302" redirect to the .org website, NOT validate
the notion that there can be multiple official sources for Tor -- or next time
we will see clones at "torproject.tk", "torproject.su" or "torproject.biz" and
those while also posing as the official ones may be not so benign in nature.

What exactly that insecurity consists of?
If your aim is to open an client-less "in-proxy" to Tor network for anyone to
use, then you might just as well open your SOCKS 5 port to the world.
AFAIK any insecurity in SOCKS is related only to authentication, i.e.
unauthorized users may be able to connect to your SOCKS proxy. But that's not
an issue if you open it to anyone "by design" anyway.

each time before browsing (yes, that's an unreasonable assumption right there).
But it's not clear at all if that's what it does, the intro and even their FAQ

into your router"?), the middlebox method of operation doesn't appear likely.
Would be nice to know more details about hardware, software, principles of

Well, maybe not the whole device down to the CPU Verilog design level, but
they could post source-code for the firmware with the instructions to build

and some GPLed tools like Busybox, they are legally obligated to provide
source to whoever they distribute the binary to, on their request. But many
router manufacturers don't bother limiting it to just that, and simply post
the source code for public download on their websites.

I am not sure "what about" them, but having E-Mail on your own domain is the
only way to have an E-Mail address you can rely on to have any sort of
longevity while allowing you the choice of providers.
Services come and go, they change their policies (or even just their user
interfaces) to the worse all the time. Your domain name always stays with you.
With an E-Mail address  you're locked-in to that provider by
the huge hassle of the prospect of changing E-Mail addresses. With an E-Mail
 you are free to choose who hosts your MXes today, it could be
a 486 PC in your closet, a Xeon dedicated server in a DC, a VPS or two, or if
you're so inclined to trust "cloud services", it could be "Google Apps for
Domains", "Yandex PDD" or any of the other "bring your own domain" E-Mail
services which will compete for having you as their client without you
allowing them to lock you in.
Having E-Mail at a domain name you own is the ultimate freedom as far as doing
your E-Mail is concerned. Wouldn't imagine someone around here would consider
the desire to be free just a "vanity".

There is no real shape or topology or any fixed node-to-node connections

from a set of chosen once and kept long-term "Guards"), then builds a so
called circuit to route a new connection via them. So a structure of the
bulk of the network is a formless cloud (the word everyone loves so much),
with maybe some silver lining representing Exit nodes.

  From the looks of it all the volunteers effectively operate open proxies for
anyone who connects to this service. To me this sounds like a total insanity,
even running a Tor Exit node can be dangerous (even though you have
bullet-proof deniability of any knowledge of the source, you can still get
into legal trouble), but here they run just single-hop relays, and judging
from rDNS some even from home broadband connections.
Joining the network as a relays is clicky-GUI-easy, and it is even
"recommended" that relay operators save full packet logs for two weeks...

Tor exit nodes can't help in finding the anonymized originator of an illegal
communication, so to speak. Everyone knows exit nodes are still several Tor
hops away from the real source, so by strong-handing or infiltrating an exit
node you can't really deanonymize those who exit through it. So there is very
low value in doing so, compared to the required effort and other expense.
Single-hop proxies on the other hand, can store logs (and this is the
recommended set-up of VPNGate), or can be forced to cooperate and install
tracking software which will reveal the originator's IP address next time they
connect. So they are an order of magnitude higher value target to pursue via
legal or not so legal ways if you want to deanonymize their users.
...i.e. muuuch more likely to cause problems to whoever hosts them.

With the influx of "popularity" that Tor now sees, we need a way to figure out
who/what are all these new "users" and what are they actually doing.
Maybe this has been proposed or considered before, but...
Why not make all exit nodes collect e.g. stats about top 10 most actively
requested destination IP addresses+ports for the past hour, both by new
outgoing connections and by amount of data transferred; then send this to a
central service run by the Tor project. In there these stats would be
immediately aggregated, so that there is no way to tell which node is
connecting to what, and only the top most popular exit IPs+ports across the
whole of the Tor network remain known. Maybe as well make this stats
collection and reporting optional or even disabled by default.
Is there really any harm to anonymity of legitimate users (i.e. not to a
multiple-thousand-of-connections botnet) or to safety of exit node
operators from implementing something like this?

For example if all of these new users are in fact a single botnet, that's now
connecting to Tor and then sitting dormant waiting for an order to instantly
DDoS into the ground any hidden service that publishes "undesirable" info...
Then will you still argue we can't discriminate against that?
At this point it could be that more than 70% of all Tor users globally are
just this botnet. Hidden service DDoS from all of them could turn out to be
very effective.
That's why I think there needs to be some way to identify what majority of the
users are up to. I understand that detecting which hidden service is being
connected to might be hard to impossible, but exit connections are out there
in the open, it is not difficult to collect stats on them.
"They are just not using any exit connections" would also be an extremely
valuable data point to have.

resident memoory, and there are no other high-RAM-usage programs active (the
bit from 'top' that I pasted is sorted by RAM usage). But the overall RAM usage
is 487MB.
Can something be done about this without reducing the throughput of the relay?
At the moment I would just kill Tor and start it back, it will take quite a while
to climb back to those levels of RAM usage.

But even there, Tor regularly starts to use 200+ MB of swap, in effect it
tries to use ~700+ MB of RAM. So I would say trying to run a relay on just
120+106 MB as you are trying to do is not feasible currently.
(Although I run a 64 bit system there in hope that crypto would be faster on
64 bit; possibly the RAM usage would be lower on 32 bit).

Second, there is the issue of trust; your host system has unrestricted access

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problematic ORPorts 
Recently on this mailing list and on tor-relays there have been some cases
when relay nodes using standard ports commonly used for other services as
their ORPort cause issues with ISPs of someone else running a relay.
Notably once a relay on port 53 have triggered "high DNS traffic anomaly" IDS
warning from the provider and almost(?) had the user's account terminated. DNS
port 53 is commonly used for DNS reflection DDoS attacks, and apparently now
ISPs have deployed measures to detect (and misdetect) these.
In one more case a relay on port 22 had the user suspicious that an SSH
brute-forcing may be going on.
And finally an ISP has suspended a relay node VPS of someone I know on a
suspicion of "having been hacked"; there was no further information on the
basis of such suspicion, but thinking about it, it's entirely plausible that
many outgoing connections to port 22 could have been the trigger.
Large amounts of traffic and a high count of open connections to these ports
is now one (and perhaps the first) case when running a non-exit relay *may*
get you in trouble with your provider.
So my idea is, maybe consider making directory authorities blacklist some
ports as being unacceptable as ORPorts, 22 and 53 come to mind for a start,
along with maybe 25 to avoid false alarms from anti-spam countermeasures.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problematic ORPorts 
First of all, if an end-user is affected by censorship, they are likely to use
Tor Bridges anyway, so the need of plain relays on standard ports does not
seem to be of much significance.
Second, to the contrary of what you describe regarding ISP relationships, it
could very well be that running a relay on a port like 22 or 53 is caused by
the opposite, i.e. by their ISP not being fully informed of what the relay
operator is doing on their machine, and as a result with the said operator
only being able to request opening/forwarding of a few innocent-looking ports
from their network administrator (e.g. university or school). Sure they
are doing this out of their best intentions to contribute bandwidth to Tor,
but if such 'contribution' ends up knocking five other much faster relays from
being able to act as relays anymore, how positive is it really.
One issue is often the very fact that having a lot of such connections can be
problematic might only be discovered post-factum*, i.e. after the user already
has been forcefully "parted" with their VPS or dedi (prepaid for a some
significant period too). Trying to explain about Tor in this case can easily
result in some less-than-qualified or overly cautious ISPs banning all Tor on
their network altogether ("oh so it was Tor that caused these SSH or DNS
attacks? OK, from now on adding a 'no Tor' rule into the ToS").
* Sure you might argue that any relay operator needs to be upfront about
running a relay with their ISP, but really, the easiest and the most workable
solution when running a non-exit relay is (or at least was, before these
port 22 and port 53 relays) to stay "below the radar".
Another issue is that the pool of hosts providing cheap or reasonably priced
unmetered VPSes or dedicated servers is far from being infinite, that you
could so easily just abandon one and move over to the next one.

And then you have a programming job on your hands to adapt Tor into the FPGA,
that could cost one or two magnitudes more than that...
Maybe I'm missing something, how anything you do inside your server (run Tor
on CPU, GPU, FPGA or magic fairies) will reduce your *bandwidth* costs?
- Tor is already sped up immensely if you use a CPU which has the hardware AES
  acceleration, i.e. almost any modern x86 CPU. (Not sure if there are any
  other operations you could offload to FPGA, or if FPGA could be faster than
  an AES-NI CPU at AES.)
- ...then you could optimize Tor to use more than ~1.3-1.5 of a CPU core at
  most as it does currently to scale further, as many modern CPUs easily have
  6-8 cores. (This is likely easier than rewriting it to use FPGA). As a
  stop-gap measure, people with such CPUs currently have to run two instances
  of Tor per each IPv4 address their server has.
In the end, if you could just fully load 8 cores of a humble $170 AES-NI CPU, I
believe this should be already enough to process a full gigabit of traffic, or
even more. And you don't really need much more, since it is rare that you can
reasonably get more than a gigabit of unmetered bandwidth per single server.

Oh actually, just remembered reading about that somewhere -- and turns out it
was in Tor's own man page:
       AllowSingleHopCircuits 0|1
           When this option is set, the attached Tor controller can use relays
           that have the AllowSingleHopExits option turned on to build one-hop
           Tor connections. (Default: 0)
       AllowSingleHopExits 0|1
           This option controls whether clients can use this server as a
           single hop proxy. If set to 1, clients can use this server as an
           exit even if it is the only hop in the circuit. Note that most
           clients will refuse to use servers that set this option, since most
           clients have ExcludeSingleHopRelays set. (Default: 0)
       ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0|1
           This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will include
           relays with the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to true. If
           ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays will be included.
           Note that these relays might be at higher risk of being seized or
           observed, so they are not normally included. Also note that
           relatively few clients turn off this option, so using these relays
           might make your client stand out. (Default: 1)
So it seems like you can already experiment with that. Dunno how many exit
nodes actually enable the single hop mode though.

environment variable. Searching around, all I found was scenarios to use it for
disabling AES-NI (for testing), e.g.:   I believe the syntax used there applies "xor" over the real flag values, e.g.
OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000" to disable AES. But what if you need to
force-enable it. Turns out the syntax working for that is simply:
  OPENSSL_ia32cap="+0x200000200000000"

As you can see "aes" is not present.
Testing OpenSSL speed in the default configuration.
# openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-128-gcm
type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes  16384 bytes
aes-128-gcm      32332.17k    40365.80k    42265.77k    42376.19k  43196.42k    43401.22k
And now we force AES hardware acceleration usage:
# OPENSSL_ia32cap="+0x200000200000000" openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-128-gcm
type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes  16384 bytes
aes-128-gcm      59047.07k   104467.39k   141712.21k   151093.93k   158321.32k   156827.65k
Almost 4 times faster! For Tor this leads to higher bandwidth utilization and lower CPU usage
(which will actually make your VPS host happier :)
But how to apply that to Tor? Well, for some initial testing I just chose to add the following
line to /etc/init.d/tor (not using systemd here), right after " /bin/bash":
  export OPENSSL_ia32cap="+0x200000200000000"
(but this will get overwritten and removed by the next Tor version upgrade).
Seems to work just fine, my CPU usage is half of what it was before, at similar bandwidth levels.
So now it has headroom to ramp up further.
A word of caution, firstly always test as shown above to verify that it works.
I believe if the underlying CPU actually doesn't support AES, all programs trying to use it,
including "openssl speed", will crash outright, with an incorrect instruction error, or somesuch.
So there is no risk to jeopardize encryption strength or security of Tor.
Also even if it works now, it may stop working down the line if the host migrates your VPS to
a node with older CPU, one which doesn't support AES. But migrations of customers between do not
happen very often, and in fact all CPUs used today in a hosting environment should support
AES, as that's been implemented in server (and even desktop) CPUs a very very long time ago.

It does not. If you look back to the original string, it also always includes

can you assume that this must be something that you have thought up, created or

for things to be "confused" about.
Moreover, if you know a few basic things about Tor, you would know what a
Guard is and what's their place and role in your connection to the Tor network.
And knowing at least the basic things about Tor is certainly a good idea

First of all, it adds a fun little competitive aspect to running a relay. In
effect it's a leaderboard of all relays ranked by bandwidth -- I like checking
out how high mine can climb, and who are the "closest competitors", with all
their funny, interesting and peculiar nicknames.
It is just the very nature of TorStatus, it is what you get right away when
loading it. Whereas with Metrics, while it does have a faint resemblance of
the same with its "top relays" display at
  * Firstly, it's by far not the focus of that website, there it's just an
    afterthought buried deep and under a weirdly located button in "Relay
    search" of all places. Instead I would expect that to be a major or even
    the primary section under "Servers".
  * Secondly, it only lists the top 250 relays -- apparently smaller ones do
    not matter -- and defaults to displaying just 10 per page, making it
    limited and inconvenient as the "bird's eye" overview. Clearly that's not
    the use that authors had in mind.
But the more important aspect is that TorStatus feels to be basically the
place where you are given credit for running a relay. You know kind of like
ending credits in a movie. Yes even if just with a line among thousands of
other lines. But all those lines representing relays and exits are what Tor
is, and look, some of your own are now up there too! You are now a part of it.
This matters a thousand times more than a canned "thanks for running a relay"
on a mailing list.

Well for instance my backend server is HTTP/1.1 only. I do run a nginx
frontend to it for HTTP/2, but due to a number of reasons I want Tor's hidden
service to point at the backend directly.
For whatever reason everyone just assumes all web servers are HTTP/2 now, and
uses "h2" like you do. What to use in case of 1.1? It almost feels like nobody
actually knows and everyone just keep reposting the same "h2" examples they
saw on the Internet.
And most importantly, how to test that the header I serve is valid and it all
actually works? I suppose there isn't any online test suite like there's
 for general HTTPS. If not, for testing do I
load the clearnet site in the Tor browser aaaaaand then expect what to happen?

There is no point in running HTTPS-over-Tor-hidden-service, as .onion traffic
is already authenticated and encrypted, it only adds useless overhead. If
there's no way around that with the alt-svc scheme, that seems like a huge

Does Tor currently use IPv6 connections for relay-to-relay traffic?
I now got some IPv6 relays which access IPv4 via tunneling to a separate
router, so it would *really* benefit my setup if some of the Tor traffic would
move to going over IPv6 directly. However that doesn't seem to be the case at
the moment (or the share is way too low).
For client connections I see there's ClientUseIPv6 which is 0 by default, any
ETA on making it default to 1?
Also ClientPreferIPv6ORPort which bizarrely means "use IPv4" when set to auto.
I remember some time ago there was a drive for people to run more IPv6 relays
or to set up ORPort in their configs if they already do. But what is the point
if the current default settings basically mean IPv6 *won't* be used?

Still if you run regular and anonymous websites in the same server process, it
is a disaster waiting to happen. At least don't forget to ensure that your

if this is even remotely critical, then just run a fully separate server
process, and a simple way to do that (granting you more isolation as a bonus)
