So I come in this evening and fire up tor as part of my nightly SOP (it is not
run continously) to get around an extremely restrictive corporate firewall. Noticed after a couple minutes, never received the [notice] stating
'sucessfully establish a tunnel.  Tor looks like its working' or what ever the
exact verbage is.  Been working for 3 months now and no client side changes on
my part.  Browsed the or-talk archive to no avail.  Seen two other folk with
this problem in Aug / Sep '05 but problem fixed itself after restarting the
client.  Not so in my case.  Posted detailed [debug] log on firefly also as an archived post suggested this.
In a nutshell, lots of:
Oct 05 23:20:20.658 [debug] circuit_remove_handled_ports(): Port 80 is not
Oct 05 23:20:20.658 [info] circuit_predict_and_launch_new(): Have 1 clean circs
(1 internal), need another exit circ.
where clean circuits vary between 0 and 1 and the internal number varies
between 0 and 3.
NOTES: - My IP is not blocked, can reach INET via non-tor routes fine
- Can connect to the master dir servers just fine.  If I delete my route-cache
it connects and downloads.  Additionally I can telnet 80 on both the prt 80 dir
Ideas?

Didn't realize 1.0.15 the most recent version (FBSD port is 1.0.14 still) so
downloaded and made a port real quick.  Working like a champ now.  Wonder if I
was getting hit by the 2 port bug and surprised it just now appeared.

@_subject: random crash, no dumpfile? 
Hey Mike,
I am the FreeBSD maintainer for the tor-devel port ... should have
1.13-alpha committed in the next day or so.  Been busy with the
upcoming port freeze and have a dozen or ports that required major
updates (nearly complete rewrites from the prior version).  Will def.
have it committed by the 20th.  If you want, i can email you quick
dirty update that won't be committed ;)
Couple questions for you:
- Did just tor dump or your entire box?
- You running i386 or amd64?

Eugen: You don't happen to be running this on FBSD 6 are you?

Was reading Rodger's slides and anybody have a link with more info on slide 41 ... "If you can see an SSL-encrypted link, you can guess what web page is inside based on length"
First I am hearing of this one and genuinely curious.

Actually a good discussion of just this recently took place on the crypto list and it basically came down to you have no way of knowing and no way to detect so just act like a magic hardware hole doesn't exist and quit worrying about it.
