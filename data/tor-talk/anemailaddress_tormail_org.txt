@_subject: [tor-talk] Using TOR and mirroring sites over it please give advice 
hoping I am using this mailing list service right! :)
I wanted to ask about anonymity and general advice about using HTTrack to
create a mirror over TOR. I got it to work by doing this
+changed the proxy setting of HTTrack to 127.0.0.1:8118 (for privoxy)
+ran Privoxy and altered the main config file by adding this instruction
forward-socks5 / localhost:9050 .
so it is chained to HTTrack I think it is said and now Privoxy directs
HTTracks HTTP requests through TOR. Now I can download clear net websites
or hidden service sites.
some kinds of questions, if maybe I do not ask the right ones please point
in the direction
+ is there a better way?
+ is this current setup a good one for anonymity or is there any problem?
+ have I made any mistakes above?
+ do you have any general advice? Example: how to make speed faster
Help is very welcome I am but a peaceful nooblet :)

I suggest Nymmos
Nym is a alias and "mos" sounds like animal so..
You make a mascot which symbolizes your os. Get some deviantart people to
make drawings.
This is the "Nymmos" a creature of great skills and legendary cunning.
It is pronounce as Nim moose.
best feature; google thinks you are looking for nymphos so namespace is
free :)

God damn why is nobody listening to me :D
Its perfect :)
Nymm = nym = alias
OS = OS
Almost no search engine hits, sounds like animal so you can create a
mascot like Tux, and Google thinks your trying to spell Nymphos!
What more could you want?
All hail the might Nymmos, fleet of foot and speed like the wind!
I have no idea what your software does but if you don't take this I shall
have to patent it :D

Like a boss! :D
You're insanely productive compared to me, how do you keep it up?
My productivity follows some kind of sine wave or something, 1 good day is
followed by 2 mediocre, 3 bad, and then back over again. I'd like to
reverse the order there.
Any observations? What works!
