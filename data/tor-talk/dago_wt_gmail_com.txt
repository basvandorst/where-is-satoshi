Could someone please send me his
  .tor/cached-routers
by e-mail. After having been off-line I don't have enough
directory information to build a circuit, and the web-proxy
blocks the regular directory look-up.
Best regards, Dago

Thank you, but I could not get a circuit even with you router-
information, and now I think I may be doing something wrong.
As normally, I use in torrc
PreferTunneledDirConns 1
TunnelDirConns 1
and I also tried __AllDirActionsPrivate and checked on the
control port
GETCONF __AllDirActionsPrivate
250 __AllDirActionsPrivate=1
Tor tells me
[notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to
build a circuit.
[notice] While fetching directory info, no running dirservers known.
Will try again later. (purpose 5)
I'm using Tor v0.1.2.13. Can anybody help? - Dago

With this I seem to have a compatibility problem due
to different versions:
Jul 27 15:10:18.313 [warn] parse error: Malformed object: bad begin line
Jul 27 15:10:18.313 [warn] Error tokenizing network-status header.
Jul 27 15:10:18.314 [warn] Couldn't parse network status.
Jul 27 15:10:18.314 [warn] Couldn't load networkstatus from
I tried tor0.1.2.13 and tor0.1.2.4-alpha, the only versions
I have here (and can access at the moment ;-()

Thanks again for trying to help. However, the warnings remain
the same, and still...
