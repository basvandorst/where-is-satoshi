@_subject: Relay: not reachable 
I'm trying to make a TOR relay.
I use GNU/Linux (Zenwalk). The ports 443, 9001, 9030, 9050, 9051 have
been authorized with Firestarter and I forwarded those ports in my
touter (Netgear CBVG834G). But I keep having those errors:
    [Warning] Your server (xx.xx.xx.xx:443) has not managed to confirm
    that its ORPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports,
    address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
    [Warning] Your server (xx.xx.xx.xx:9030) has not managed to confirm
    that its DirPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports,
    address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
If this comes from /etc/hosts, I don't know what to add.
Can someone help me, please?
