For those who are curious, here's an in-depth guide to Freedom Hosting:

If DPR has really been known since March 2011, that'd be pretty incredible.
The FBI is really playing the long game. It's impossible to say at this
point though.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Illegal Activity As A Metric of Tor Security and 
I think the Freedom Hosting and Silk Road arrests shook many people's
confidence greatly, so they're very hesitant to keep using illegal hidden
services. Everything else beyond that seems like conjecture, especially the
idea that all of the narcotics markets are backed by spooks. If there is a
base for that, though, I'm all ears.

I'm curious about this too. What exactly is being measured here?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in the media 
Hi everyone,
Over the past few weeks, I've talked with a number of Tor people about how
the project is portrayed in the media. As a reporter on this beat, the many
legitimate criticisms the community have had strike pretty close to home
for me. I don't think I need to tell this list why Tor's portrayal in the
media is important, now more than ever. So, with the blessing and
encouragement of a couple of official Tor people, I've got a question to
ask of tor-talk (secure contact info follows at the bottom of the message):

Thanks for the suggestions Griffin (and everyone else who has emailed me),
I really appreciate it! I'll be taking your advice and reaching out to the
people you've mentioned.
As to the complaints, since they take up a good chunk of your email: I
don't take me or my employer to be exempt from any problems covering Tor. I
wouldn't have sent the email if I didn't think I had a lot of room for
improvement. Obviously I think it is legitimate to cover people buying
drugs and other "salacious" activities. And it's important to report on for
more reasons than simply because "it's exciting" but I think we agree that
there is a wider scope of activity that has to be talked about. Again,
that's why I sent the email.
Just to briefly address the Firefox article criticism, since that seems to
have been prevalent among Tor people, here's one reason why it wasn't just
blind speculation: As to needing confirmation of facts: I spoke to Tor, I spoke to Firefox,
and neither confirmed nor denied what I asked about. I'm not going to spike
a piece based on no-comments, especially when I make it clear that the
article is not 100% stone cold fact. There's nothing wrong with informed
speculation as long as it's clearly labeled.
As far as the many minor errors my articles have, I'm happy to keep having
discussions about factual issues in my articles. My work is far, far from
perfect but I'm happy to strive to get better. That's another conversation
but I'm happy to have it here if you want to keep chatting. Suffice to say,
I think my work is more than defensible.
And finally to address the surveillance article: I didn't personally credit
Jacob's Wikileaks work for surveillance of Tor people, I quoted someone who
did. I also really take issue with the characterization that anyone was
actively blaming Jacob or Wikileaks for the surveillance. I certainly
wasn't and I really don't think Andrew, who I quoted, was doing that
either. It's related, and that's why it's included and expanded upon, but
no one is sitting here wagging their finger at anyone else. It wasn't my
intention to "fight" you or "blame" Jacob and it's almost a little
surprising that it was interpreted that way. Almost. But then being
misinterpreted is part of the paycheck and it's my job to do better next
time and make sure people understand what I mean to say.

Well, this thread went nowhere fast. Sorry guys! And thanks to people who
emailed me. Cheers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Misogyny on tor-talk is an existential threat to Tor 
(or do they?) but we're all out there fighting the good fight. Our work
just isn't salacious enough to merit a poorly-written gossip column.
While I completely understand Tor people's reservations about the press
you've received over the years, there are two important points to make here
a) While there are plenty of negative articles about Tor, it's easy to
forget that much of the press and social media chatter about Tor is
extremely positive (See: the chatter about Comcast allegedly blocking Tor
or HN or reddit or twitter or anywhere I saw) and one of the most popular
articles I've ever seen on Tor (at least in terms of the media I keep an
eye on) was about Andrew's work with domestic abuse and stalking victims.
b) There are journalists who want to interview you about your work and who
find it extremely important. I've sent you an email about it in the recent
past :) There may be a bunch of reasons why you decline to talk about it
with me specifically, plenty of which may be valid, but let's not pretend
there is no interest in your work. If you don't particularly trust me to
write that article, I can definitely accept that, but don't doubt that
there would be a line of journalists out the door if you spoke out a little
more about the great work you do. This is true of a lot of the objectively
positive work Tor people do that even the most biased voice couldn't
tarnish. At the end of the day, you all barely talk about it. It's very
noble that you're doing great work and not trumpeting it in the public but
in that case you can't easily blame journalists for not always writing
about it.
And, for the hell of it, a third point:
c) I'm sure that many people on Tor-talk, like many in the general public,
find the work you do important. Tor-talk tends to dwell on other issues,
technical and what have you, but is this mailing this really terribly
gossipy? It's not talked about here for various reasons but I'd be shocked,
honestly shocked, if most of us didn't care to hear about the ways Tor is
helping change these peoples' lives for the better.
