@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't download my Facebook archive via Tor Browser 
I am trying to download my Facebook archive and hopefully I get to leave
Facebook forever - I did before but due to family communication as well
as relatives, I had to make one again. I can't download my archive since
I was using Tor Browser - I was even using the .onion domain by
Facebook. How do I go about this?

Thanks for the fix Alec! Though, I'd rather wait for the Onion fix, not
that in a rush :)
Thanks a lot and looking forward for the fix! Could you keep in touch?

Hi guys!
So I'm running a Tails on a DVD-R version 1.5 and I'm very curious as to
if I'm running a legitimate copy of Tails. Could you guys help me? Thanks a lot!

Hey man thanks a lot! I'm doing it right now, seems like it'll take a while - I think it's been almost 10 mins? Also, ever since I booted this Tails DVD-R, I couldn't join into OFTC via Pidgin. I also have tried OFTC.NET but tells me "no TOR anonymous access" or some sort. What's up with that? Those are the things I expect the most to give me access or give mo no hasle.
Thanks a lot!

I downloaded the image and burned it on a DVD-R. Yes I did that verification step, I did it via command line way.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Best devices to boot Tails off of? 
Hi there,
Are there flash drives that really work well with Tails? Or does it not
really matter? I installed Tails on a Sandisk Cruzer and it seems it
wouldn't boot or at least show the login screen, just gets stuck with
the blue and white progress bar. I think I have seen a list of which
devices will probably work well with Tails but I'm not sure. Are DVD-R's
the safest way to boot Tails off of? How do can I further protect my
Tails installation on a flash drive? Would doing a checksum from another
OS on my Tails device help ensure it's safeness/integrity?
Thanks a lot!

Sorry but I'm just too pissed! I was doing something important when it

Could you guys help me? I can't use Facebook or even log in successfully
via Tor Messenger. I just get stuck at "gathering contacts list..." or
something like that. I was successful with Twitter though. Still, I'm
looking forward to using Tor Messenger instead of the site. How do I go
about this? I'm sure I entered the correct credentials.

Nah what I mean is I'm using the .onion address of Facebook. Seems like
enabling chat in the website connected Facebook in Tor Messenger, though
I still don't see anyone or a Facebook chat window.

Had it working earlier but doesn't really show me my buddies in real
time. Like when someone's on line or off line in the website, it doesn't
show the same people in Tor Messenger. I disconnected then connected TM
again, hopefully it works right this time. I understand that this is
still beta, so far I'd say it's doing well! Thanks a lot guys!

I had it working a while ago :)
I followed Singh's advice, which is to turn on the chat in Facebook's
desktop site. Just in case, make sure username is correct. Hmmm, what
else, there's a lot more he said in earlier in this thread, should not
be hard to see it :)
I'd be glad to help :p

I actually have it working now lol. Though, I'm pretty sure it ain't
showing my buddies in real time. Twitter seems to work well though.
Despite the issues, I'm impressed how TM (swag acronym :p) currently works.
