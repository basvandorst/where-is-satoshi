now the torstatus.blutmagie.de is going down, I need an alternative.
I need a list of "Tor nodes IPv4".
The IP list of (All Tor nodes) - (Tor Exit nodes) if possible.
Can't Tor Project host one PHP script for this?
I really need it for my server.
Allow only outgoing IF destination is Tor Nodes
Deny all

Forbidden - TOR Node / Anonymous Proxy
I'm sorry, but I really don't see why anyone would need to use a TOR node
or Anonymous Proxy server to look at my site.
So i'm afraid you can't look. Stop running TOR / using an anonymous proxy
and you can view my site.
Alternative, anyone!?
