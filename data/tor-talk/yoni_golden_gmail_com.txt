@_subject: [tor-talk] Academic work about Deep Web 
I'm a student in Haifa University at the Information & Knowledge Management Department and I'm writing a paper about the deep web.
One of the most important projects regarding the deep web is the Tor Project, which give access to some of the websites, including the .onion sites.
I tried to look for hidden content with the Tor Browser, and most of the .onion websites were dealing with "controversial" activity.
I wanted to ask if you know of commercial companies who have .onion web sites? and if .onion websites being built also for "positive" and "legitimate" purposes?
I'm writing you only for the purposes of my academic work and research.
Thank you for your help
