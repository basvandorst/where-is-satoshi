@_subject: [tor-talk] REAL-ID Internet Access Coming Soon 
I am Chinese and I have something to say..
actually, the Real-ID Internet already built in China in 6 years ago.
The Police in China can type your email/username or something else
information into a system called "Cyber identity analysis system" that can
analysis your realname and your home address even you didn't provide your
real identity. The data comes from ISP and websites, local police can use
some executive order to force ISP to record all of the data (maybe Port
Mirroring) then send the records to the police(yes, include your
password)..The executive order is also applied to websites that based on
China, they will force Chinese Company to send all of the userdata include
password ( to police.
The only way to avoid China's police is use Tor and use a different
username/email/password for each site..

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service Hosting (Free experimental, offer) 
I am using another way to solve IP leaks problem.
my host-os is CentOS and only installed VirtualBox
I have 2 virtual machines running on the host-os
the first one is a CentOS with 2 network adapter, one is NAT , another is
Internal(ip: 192.168.222.1).
it running Tor and ShadowSocks(bypass GFW) , Tor through ShadowSocks and
listen on 192.168.222.1:9050 (Internal Adapter)
Another is also CentOS and running apache, only one network
adapter(Internal ip:192.168.222.2)
when this virutal machine wants to access internet , must set socks5 proxy
to 192.168.222.1:9050
so even this VM gets hacked, the attacker still can't know the real IP....

you said you uses Host-Only adapter in your VM, so you need set the proxy
as YOUR_HOST_IP:9050 not 127.0.0.1:9050

2. use this phone number to register Google Voice

Twitter uses IP address as a factor to detect "abnormal activities" just
like Google sometimes gives us some CAPTCHA...maybe we need more exit nodes
