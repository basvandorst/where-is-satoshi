@_subject: [tor-talk] Possible Whois demasking of Tor using 
Hello, listers!
I have detected that some IP addres of obfs3 briges have demasking
WHOIS information. For example
obfs3 bridge with IP at range 192.36.31.0 - 192.36.31.255
(there are several bridges; I dont want to publish it at the list but
can send by private messages if somebody wants).
RIPE WhoIs tool at reports on this address:
I think these whois data and remarks easy can demasking using
of Tor network by ISPs. Also it may cause blocking of bridges IP in
some areas.
194.132.208.0 - 194.132.208.255 IP range has the same problem.
I wrote to Tor developers about this but have no answer received yet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why obfs4 bridges aren't work in Tails? 
My story:
During booting from Tails LiveUSB I choice to use obfs4 bridges:
obfs4 141.201.*.*:45785
obfs4 68.45.*.*:*
obfs4 54.66.*.*:18965
obfs4 82.243.*.*:990
(full data of these non-publish bridges I can send via private e-mail
if someone need)
but during several minutes Tails doesn't make Tor connection. Process has stopped at "Establishing an encrypted directory connection".
Tails 1.3 and later have to support bfs4 bridges as announced.
Why this can happen?

s7r :
I've made some log analisys and (may be) found why obfs4 bridges don't
work correctly.
I've used tcpdump created by that command:
sudo tcpdump ip -n -nn -x | tee tcpdump.txt
and Tor log file located at /var/log/tor/log
The possible reason is IP-packet fragmentation. I
suspect that obfs4-protocol require sending big packet (with "no
fragmentation" flag/option) and router of my local network and(or)
other routers on the connection way can not pass these packets. My
routers answer: "unreachable - need to frag (mtu 1456)". And in Tor
[info] smartlist_choose_node_by_bandwidth(): Empty routerlist passed in to old node selection for rule weight as guard
[info] should_delay_dir_fetches(): Delaying dir fetches (no running bridges known)
[info] compute_weighted_bandwidths(): Empty routerlist passed in to consensus weight node selection for rule weight
as guard
many times.
obfs3, obfs2 and bridges without pluggable transport all are working

Roger Dingledine :
And splitting and merging of encrypted TCP packets at random positions
are possible solution, with addition random number (several tens max) of
random bytes to each packet? Or this has already realized in pluggable
transports but I don't know?
As I understand, attacks of this type based on comparing of logs/dumps
at both ends of TOR chain: user's local ISP and distant server (may be
with specially created trapping web site). Even if content of these
packets can't be decrypted, comparing of number, lenghts and times of
packets make it possible to establish the fact of connection. Even user
had been loading several pages from different sites simultaneously, its
possible to evolve packets by its lengths because each TOR node in
chain decrease lenght of packet by fixed number of bytes when
decrypting a layer. Isn't it?

Travis Bean  ?????:
It's not neccessary to be controlled by NSA or have access to the NSA's
confidential information to block a web site from Tor users. As I
understand, all IP's and ports of Tor exit nodes are public and
available for any Tor user. These are downloadings from Tor authorities
servers and can be viewed throw Vidala - Network Map, "arm" command and
may by some other tools. Tor entry node can be a unpublished Tor bridge
if you configure it, but Tor exit node will be from public nodelist
anyway. (Or unpublished private Tor exit nodes exist and I can obtain
and use these?).
So, site blocking software can simple accessing Tor network every hour
and having an actual list of Tor exit nodes, and blocking requests
from them.
Reason to do it... may be possible attacks on site from Tor hacking
users or some other network abuse.
For example, Wikipedia partially block Tor users and they can read it
but can't login and edit pages. ripe.net blocking whois service from
many Tor exits. Can we think that all of them also "mysteriously
controlled by the United States Gestapo government"?
