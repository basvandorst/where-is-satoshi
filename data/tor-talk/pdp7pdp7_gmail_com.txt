@_subject: [tor-talk] evidence that Tor isn't "amoral"? 
Greetings - I am a Tor Browser user and also an operator of a couple
Tor relays.  I believe the Tor Project has a noble mission.
An online friend recently claimed to me that "amoral content is a huge
portion of the exit node traffic".  I believe by "amoral" he meant
sexual exploitation.  The conversation was sparked by my complaint
that the new show "Mr. Robot" couldn't resist introducing Tor in the
same breath as child porn.
I don't believe that the majority of Tor traffic is "amoral", but I
would like to find data to support my belief.  Anyone know of such
research or statistics?

Good point - let me rephrase:
I believe I've seen Roger and Jacob refute such claims that Tor
traffic is all illegal activities, and I believe I've read posts in
support of that.  Unfortunately, I'm having trouble finding the
appropriate links at the moment.
I'd like to be able to say: the majority of Tor usage is positive for
humanity and here's why...

Thanks for your detailed response Speak Freely and everyone that responded,
That Wired article was quite helpful.
And I agree that the term "amoral" is a poor choice in making an argument.
It is not the correct word in this context.  I think my friend meant
immoral, but that is problematic as the meaning of immoral can be
Here's what I ended up writing as a rebuttal to my friend's criticism:
I do not believe that the majority of Tor traffic is "amoral" (by which I
assume you mean criminal activity like sexual exploitation?).  There has
been a lot of misinformation in the media reports of research projects.
Here's a good article from Wired:
No, Department of Justice, 80 Percent of Tor Traffic Is Not Child Porn
More background on the Tor blog:
I should say that this mostly discusses Hidden Services. Hidden Services
are a small amount of the total traffic on the Tor network.
There does not seem to be sound data on what types of traffic flow through
Exit node.  Collecting such data would violate the principles of operating
an Exit.  Some researchers have done this, but I think the data collected
is too limited to provide an accurate picture.

Quite interesting.  After reading the replies in this thread, I now
agree that the true definition of amoral is a good description of Tor.
As an exit node operator, I do think of myself as being an impartial
conduit for Internet traffic.
I personally believe Tor does more good than harm by allowing people
in repressive regimes access to information.  I  realize I can't
control what people choose to do with that access - I can only to
provide the means to use the Internet freely.
