Hi, If you were using a Tor Hidden Services of your Jabber server I would
recommend to backup the database with hand-verified SSL certificates too.
Keep the file "cert_override.txt", otherwise you have to verify the SSL
certificates again. You will find it in the same directory.
Thanks for new beta.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Elliptic Curve Crypto and the NSA 
Are you talking about the paper "A Riddle Wrapped in an Enigma"? I have another opinion. I didn't read something like "they may have broken
elliptic curves". The NSA  crypto experts expected that elliptic curves
(ECC) and RSA will be broken by a quantum computer in the future, in the
more or less near future. But until this will happen, RSA and ECC offer
equal security.
NSA recommendation for Suite B ciphers is NOT: "moving away from ECC now",
It means: "if you are  still using RSA, don't  spend money to move to ECC,
wait for PQC". (PQC: post quantum crypto)
A short comment by Matthew Green to step in without mathematics you may
find here:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Russia actually kind of cracked (?) Tor 
Andreas Krey :
I'm not sure about this. The Utimaco Lawful Inspection Units LIMS (used by
big German email providers)  contain a "X1 admin interface" (or
"Management Server") which can used for administration of affected targets
and LEAs directly from the law enforcement agency like SORM.
See LIMS product description:
The "Management Server" of the LIMS unit can get all information for
provisioning a lawful interception by "H1 interface" directly from the law
enforcement agency.
I don't know, how X1 and H1 interfaces are used in real use cases, but it
ready to go.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How the NSA breaks Diffie-Hellmann 
the paper "How is NSA breaking so much crypto?" got the Best Paper Award
at ACM CCS im Oct. 2015.
Diffie-Hellman is a cornerstone of modern cryptography used for VPNs,
HTTPS websites, email, and many other protocols. The paper shows that many
real-world users of Diffie-Hellman are likely vulnerable to state-level
A state-level attacker like NSA can pre-compute the most common used 1024
bit DH parameter sets which are recommend in RFC 2409. If pre-computation
was done for the two most common used DH parameter sets the NSA can braek
2/3 of VPN connections, 1/4 of SSH connections and 1/5 of SSL/TLS
connections on-the-fly.
EFF.org recommends to disable DHE cipher in Firefox and Chrome: "How to Protect Yourself from NSA Attacks on 1024-bit DH"
An other more advanced solution for TorBrowser would be possible. You can
increase the min. length for DH parameter to 2048 bit in NSS lib. Min.
length for DH parameter was set to 1024 in NSS 3.19.1 to avoid Logjam
attack. May be, it is time to increase it to 20148 bit?

I would recommend it for the "Medium High" level too, because I think,
this level  works almost good for users with high security requirements.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Messenger Beta: Chat over Tor, Easily 
Tor user may use TorChat or the successor Ricochet for chatting. It works
server-less. TorChat offers file transfer. This feature I'm missing in
Ricochet and TorMessenger.
TorMessenger may be useful to stay anonymous during communication with
non-Tor users or stay in touch with groups. If your friends offer a XMPP
contact address or if you want to join IRC, you may use it.
(only my opinion)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why most democratic contries are most active users 
Most or at least many "Tor user" are malicious bots. In summer 2013 80% of
Tor users were bots of the Mevade.A botnet, not real users. Military cyber forces are using Tor botnets too. In April 2014 (during
Ukraine crisis) a hidden service botnet was launched only in Russia.  Don't take the metrics as real users.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why most democratic contries are most active users 
The Mevade.A botnet had 4 million bots, which were using Tor in summer
2013. Some links:
Mevade.A has done some mistakes by switching all bots in a short time to
Tor. This behaviour attracts more attention to the botnet:
I think, Tor usage is a mirror of real world problems. Everybody, who want
s to have a little anonymity, is using Tor. Malicious bots hiding C&C
communication, criminals selling drugs, people watching all kinds of porn,
intelligence agencies and military cyber forces are using Tor.... and so
on. Human rights activists in bloody regimes with murderous dictators are a
very very small group in real world and it is a very small group among Tor
users too.  Karsten N.

2013 FBI and Freedom Hosting:
2015 FBI operation "Playpen"
In both cases, the FBI took over the Tor onion sites platform and
deployed a network investigative technique on the Tor hidden service
sites - the agency's term for a hacking tool. That tool used a
vulnerability to circumvent the protections of the Tor Browser Bundle,
and then installed a trojan, which grabbed the suspect's IP address and
system information.
For operation "Playpen" an own new 0-day exploit was used by FBI.
Mozilla and TorProject tried to get informations about the bug,
But the bug was classified by FBI because of "National Security".

SPAM filters are using the client IP in mail header for  classification,

Yahoo! adds the the client IP (in your case the IP of an Tor exit node)
to the first "received from" mail header. May be, some Tor exit relays
are listed in some DNSBL?
You may try a Tor-friendly mailprovider or at least a mail provider,
which doesn't add the client IP to the mailheader. I think, this will
solve most problems with false positve SPAM.

Are you sure it was a man-in-the-middle?
May be, the other communication partner uses another device?
Man-in-the-middle for OTR on exit nodes needs a man-in-the-middle for
transport encryption (TLS) first. In this case, the pasword for your
Jabber account is compromised, you have to change it.

Ohhh my dear - have a look at the website of TorProject.org and look at
"Who is using Tor":
Yes - militaries and especially intelligence agencies around the world
are using Tor and this is not a secret and it is not new. If NATO is
using Tor, why not Russians too? It is an open network for everybody.
By the way:
Like others I can not see any proof or evidence for this story. Some
emails were leaked because somebody used the password "PASSWORD" for his
email account and was tricked together with others by a phishing attack
- thats clear, but nothing more.
You may have a look at the leaked emails (at the content of the emails)
and may be, you can read, how the "leaders of the free world" tried to
manipulate the US-election. Why we don't talk about the content of the
leaked emails? But this question is not Tor-related and off-topic here.
