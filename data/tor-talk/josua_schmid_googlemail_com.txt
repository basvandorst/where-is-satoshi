Hi folks!
I  tried to set up a tor connection from within the "bundesagentur f?r
arbeit" network, but something seems to block the tor network access.
I  introduced  bridges  in  the torrc config file but it didn't change
anything. I'm still not able to connect.
Here is my latest torrc:
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1

ControlPort 9051

Here is the command line output of tor:
tor -f torrc

And here is the output when using vidalia:

I'm  using  Windows  XP  SP3,  not  firewalled. I have no idea how the
blocking  takes place, but some websites are not reachable from within
this  network  (because  the  students  are supposed to study, also in
their free time...).
Any ideas what to do to make it connect?
Thanks a lot!
Josua
