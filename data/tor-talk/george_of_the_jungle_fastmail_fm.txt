@_subject: [tor-talk] OT: Tor mentioned in "The Following" TV show 
In case anyone is interested, I was watching this week's The Following,
episode titled "Whips and Regret," and Tor was mentioned very quickly in
passing, verbatim:
Bad lady that runs online pron sites says at minute 13:34 to 14:50: "I have some foreign clients, they're into the hardcore illegal stuff .
. . He setup my computer and the server, I needed an untraceable Tor
system [for the hardcore illegal porn], and he knew that stuff."
. Great. They say any press is good press, but I'm not so sure.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Windows TBB v2.3.25-4 Firefox can't connect to Internet 
Hello list,
For a long time now I've configured Vidalia to start an installed alpha
Tor on my system, instead of the stable Tor included within TBB. Then,
with a few versions TBB around the same time as the Windows TBB Aero
theme bug, Vidalia started freezing and then crashing when I changed the
path of Tor exe. Then, in a later version of TBB this issue was fixed.
The current bug is new. The current bug is explained below, as a
copy/paste from the ticket I created for this issue ( There is a work
around this bug, and that's dropping an alpha Tor (copied from an
installed alpha Tor) over the stable Tor found in TBB, however, I'm
unsure if doing so means I'm doing something stupid . . . please advise.
Thank you very much

@_subject: [tor-talk] What would Tor v1.0 look like? 
I've been using Tor for many years now (when Tor was hosted by EFF), and
I love how fast and far Tor is progressing, as well as other Tor Project
projects (e.g., TorBrowser and TorButton). I've always wondered what it
would take for Tor to be called v1.0, e.g., how different would that Tor
be vs. the current Tor?
If anyone is interested in this topic, I'd love to read all input. E.g.,
would Tor v1.0 be considerably 'faster' (unless 'speed' more an issue of
number of nodes)? Would Tor use UDP? Would Tor v1.0 be more secure (I
know that's an awfully open-ended question, sorry!)? Would Tor be
(close-to) unblockable (e.g. by the Chinese firewall) though use of
bridges?  Would Hidden Services be more robust in terms of security and
anonymity [0], and, would surfing to them be 'faster'?. . . ? . . . ?
coderman wrote about his pie-in-the-sky Tor v2.0 [0], and it sounded
pretty bad ass, even tough I probably misunderstood most of his
technical writing.

Your last sentence reminds me of a quote I read somewhere (not
"When I was young I thought life was a sprint, when I was middle-aged I
thought life was a marathon, when I was old I realized life if a relay
race." :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Help: Concurrently run TBB and an Obfs bridge from 
I want to help censored Tor users by running an obfsproxy bridge, but I
(think I) also want to concurrently run TBB for my personal use. The
reason I would rather not use the TBB as the obfsproxy bridge is I don't
leave TBB open and running 24/7; unless starting/stopping the obfs
bridge a few times per day isn't 'bad.'
I don't know where to start because the Tor Project is very large and
complex (at least to me). Here are a few questions I hope someone
can/will answer, please forgive these if you think they're basic; I
searched before I sent this e-mail, to no avail:
1. How the heck do I run an obfs bridge on Windows? (IIRC, I recall
reading a very complex instruction page, I wonder if it's now easier to
run an obs bridge on Windows)
2. Is it unhelpful to run an obfs bridge if it starts/stops a few times
per day?
3. If the answer to 2 is yes, how can I concurrently run two Tors, on
for the obfs bridge and one for my TBB? (I know how to do this on
non-Windows, I'm hoping it easy to do on Windows)
