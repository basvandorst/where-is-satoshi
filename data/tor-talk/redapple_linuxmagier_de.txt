Hi TOR-Geeks,
as I'm not sure (ok,maybe I've to less information), these Vidalia + TOR +
 Proxy or TOR-Button, are problematic to set up correctly and there is a
big chance to do something wrong, which would reveal your Identity.
So I came about this
HOWTO set up a Middlebox which routes ALL Traffic through TOR on a
Hostsystem from a
This great work was made by
chris_dj .
I can't understand why there is so less information about him. Tell me, if
you find out.
My intention is to find someone who has the brains and the geekness and who
is willing to rewrite this tutorial on a public place especially even for
Unfortunately I don't have the full knowlege of all the involved parts.
But, I promise: If you write a noobfriendly HOWTO but more actual, in more
detail and understandable for most people, I'll translate it to german!
I think there are a lot of advantages over the "standard" TOR installation.
For example, no need for a proxy. And all those cryptic .onion links are
simply machines (whithout ports). So you can set up your favorite Client to
use OnionNet (IRC) by simply providing the .onion Address and the port
(z.B. 6667).
And of course I would like to know what you guys think about the Idea and
if this work makes sense in any way.

Hi adrelanos,
first thanks for your interest, always happy 'bout feedback,
And thanks for the Links about whoonix and the like. I was flying over the
documentation, and read about TORBox before.
IMHO the problem is, to set up TWO virtual machines, while the tor client
could run on the host system and the locked in applications in the secure
VM MUST route their traffic through TOR.
Of course you need to set up some Networkinterfaces and bridges, as well as
for example dnsmasq, but even with that, I think at least a tutorial
(needn't be a full project) would be worthy,
Ok. Now I have to admit my lack of knowledge about network
bridges/interfaces and Firewall (butI'm working on it),

ok. You're right, its easy to imort 2 appliances and youre nearly on the
I wasn't even on the way to import a ready apliance. I had mine set up from
Lubuntu myself. :-)
Ok. Well. Maybe it's because I know what I have with my selfmade solution,
or I feel more comfortable with only one VM running on my host, or
whatever... But I think some docs would be worthy for at least some people.
But anyway! Maybe if I find the time, I'll write some docs and/or tuts in
german and you then have to translate them to english. ;)
Best regards, thanks for advices and talk,
