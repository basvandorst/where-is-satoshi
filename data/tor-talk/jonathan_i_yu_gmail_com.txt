What about the Soekris boards?
The lowest end board, net4501, with a case is $173 USD.
133 Mhz CPU, 64 Mbyte SDRAM, 3 Ethernet, 2 Serial, CF socket, 1
Mini-PCI socket, 3.3V PCI connector.
The low processor speed may hinder encryption, but other than that, it
looks like it would make a pretty good replacement for Gumstix.
Probably not as small, though.
It might be nice to note that these boards have been in production for
a pretty long time and continue to be so. Also some firmwares like
DD-WRT support this hardware.
