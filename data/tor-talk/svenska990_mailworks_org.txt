@_subject: [tor-talk] New to List 
I am new to the mailing list but using Tor for awhile now. First, cheers
to the developers - this service is great!
After reading in a great many FAQs, wikimedia pages, and so on - I am
still bit worried about local DNS being revealed.
Here is my set-up and what I have done: Running v.0.2.2.34, Linux/Ubuntu
environ, Firefox of course with network.proxy.sock 'true' - all traffic
goes through SOCKS5. Connecting to network no problem.
Added "TestgSocks 1" to torrc file to see log output, followed from
I am not seeing warnings, just not convinced no DNS leaking. Also even
though added to torrc, not getting anything to test in the logs. Every
time I access .onion sites browser times out.
Any helpful next steps? How can I be sure?
I first posted this question to tor-qa but it appears that nobody
subscribes to this list. Apologies if this is incorrect list and please point me in the right
direction if so.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Thunderbird/TBB Config Question 
Greetings in a New Year!
I've recently switched from Tor + Privoxy setup to the more convenient
TBB 0.2.2.35 (Qt4.6.2) in a Linux environment. Under prior config. it
was easy to set up the Thunderbird email client for use with Tor.
However, after the TBB install the same configuration for T'Bird no
Perhaps ^^ is an old link? What is the best step? Because TBB
automatically uses SOCKS (at least for Aurora), perhaps I no longer need
bother with the manual set up in T'Bird?
If I were to recommend the Thunderbird setup with Tor to someone in a
country where an improper configuration might result in a knock on the
door in the middle of the night, I would want the margin for error as
near zero as possible. Even one non-anon log-in to email might cause
problems. Consider me professionally paranoid. Erich Kroener
