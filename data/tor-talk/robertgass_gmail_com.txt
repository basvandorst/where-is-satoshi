@_subject: [tor-talk] Many more Tor users in the past week? 
Is the fundamental problem that these clients are connecting to TOR without
the user knowing?
Could there be an initial, one time, human test for for access?  Unique
tokens could be granted after a CAPTCHA, or something similar, and
exchanged for initial handshakes between routers and clients.  Of course
then you'd have the problem of who to trust to sign these "is-human" tokens
without centralizing.  There could be something similar to a web of trust.
This would be a huge headache for people that operate a large number of
routers, but maybe that's also a good thing?
