Hi All,
Looking at the current ways of people getting .onion addresses
(using dubious forums or source), I was wondering if there is someone
working/researching on a way to rank .onion addresses to allow a user
to see the ranking/trust of an .onion address.
Thank you.

There are many tools for collaborative filtering/ranking
of URLs.
Like  and others. Not sure if they
work for .onion URLs. It would need to test this.
Sure but the idea was maybe to improve the hidden service protocol by
adding a trust/reputation level from the Tor users.
