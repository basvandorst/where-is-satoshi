Hello everybody! Is it possible to limit the server to client data
transfer rate for hidden service? If there is what is the right method
of doing so? P.S I don't mean the relay.

I'm using my own/vps to use with my own domain and it's much easier when
you may/can choose what you use your domain for. For example: For
hosting your own site with info about you or something else.
I actually own an 478 socket PC which still is online everyday and it
works perfectly. I have also noticed an interesting thing which is that
it's pretty hard to find email service that hides your own IP address
and this one that i'm currenty using is one of those. I like being an
anonymous 'cuz it's just easier way to go. Even if you want just chat on
email lists.
I know that do NOT run your servers at USA/UK if you wan't your data be
secure. I'm using an Finland provider 'cuz their law does not allow any
other agentcy or anything like that to gain access to your files so
easilly. So if anobody of you here wants an good place to keep your data
save please choose an Service Provider from Finland. Most of them accept
USD, EUR and some other currencys.
I'll attach my PGP public key to this in case somebody wants to chat
with me with encrypted emails.
is the
with you.
provider by
could be
two, or if
as doing

How many ways are there to be anonymous without using Tor?
I think that these are most of the options out there:
VPN, Web Proxy & something else?
Anonymous and Internet freedom(Free Speech) supporter.
