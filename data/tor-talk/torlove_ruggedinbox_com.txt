@_subject: [tor-talk] What's better than Tor for criminals? 
I'm an avid tor lover and user.
I'm trying to understand a statement I've heard a number of people on the
Tor team and in the Tor community repeat over the years and was wondering
if it could be explained.
The statement: Paraphrasing, it's been said several times, by Roger, etc,
"Criminals have much better options available to them than Tor for strong
internet anonymity."
I'm trying to understand what these options are and why don't we
non-criminal tech savvy people have some of these better options?
Is this just talking about the option of using encrypted botnets, or are
there other additional options that criminals use?
What are these criminal anonymity methods that are stronger than Tor?
Thanks all!
