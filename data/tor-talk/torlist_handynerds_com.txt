@_subject: [tor-talk] Short video on how Tor works 
Hello Tor users.  Just writing a quick note about a video I made on how
Tor works.
I got some good feedback from Roger & Andrew, and even a tweet from Andrew
But in case you don't follow the twitterz, I thought I'd post it here.
I'd appreciate any feedback.  Thanks!
