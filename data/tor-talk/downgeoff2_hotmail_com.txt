As I understand it (Library/Privoxy/user-manual/config.html Section 7.5.2) those lines forward all requests from Privoxy through Tor: if you want Privoxy filtering without using Tor in client mode, you have to comment those lines out. Then if at some point you *do* want to use Tor in client mode (still with Privoxy), you have to reinstate them.

So far so good. A possible problem then arises when the served page contains absolute URLs for resources, links etc which no longer use the .exit notation, and so could be fetched from a different exit. How often that would happen is open to question.
Another Privoxy rule could be written to rewrite those page URLs I guess, but how would you pass the name of the required exit to the rule?

I've had the following show up in my logs several times now, but not every time:
"[warn] Your system clock just jumped 160 seconds forward; assuming established circuits no longer work."
There are big blocks of these errors occuring 3 minutes 40 seconds or so apart, for 3 hours.
The reported clock jump is always 150-170 seconds, and always forwards.
After the warnings there are
"[notice]Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up. (waiting for circuit)
[notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working."
 If my clock had actually jumped that much it would be wildly incorrect by now!

I don't know the technicalities of SOCKS proxies, but I'm 95% certain that .exit notation caused errors from destination servers over a year ago - it's not a new problem.
Of course some servers aren't running virtual hosts and so don't care about the
"Host: example.com.nickname.exit"
header - perhaps you just haven't come across the problem before if you don't use .exit notation much?
Perhaps one of the developers could weigh in on whether Tor itself should be modifying the Host header - it may be moot as .exit notation is deprecated now (and the whole excludenodes business under review).

Thanks for the info.
It's the binary that came with OSX - I don't compile.

Forgive me if I misunderstand, but isn't that inconsistent with running Tor as a separate, unprivileged user? It also complicates starting up Tor at boot. Are those things only intended for expert users now? It's some time since I started Tor with Vidalia so perhaps I am misremembering how it used to work.

@_subject: PS RE: OSX bundle 
A couple of matters arising from the log after installing
"Jan 23 19:59:34.944 [notice] Tor 0.2.1.21 opening log file.
 Permission denied"
 So it's still announcing itself as 0.2.1.21, and hasn't been able to run as group 'daemon' (hence the lack of write permission in /var/run/) .
Here's the slightly altered command in the autorun script:
 (BTW, how do I map process group number (as output from ps -ajx -O gid) to the group name?)
 In this case I can see the group is the same as the user - both 'tor'.

"So it's still announcing itself as 0.2.1.21",
my mistake, different binary from the Vidalia.app one.
 "and hasn't been able to run as group 'daemon' (hence the lack of write permission in /var/run/)" .
 there was this message when I ran Tor from the command line:

@_subject: Torbutton Documentation - Adversary Capabilities. 
I may need correcting here, but I believe that things like Javascript timers are stored in memory as part of the page's Document Object Model (DOM), and DOM Storage attacks are one of the things that Torbutton protects against. The DOM disappears when the window or tab is closed anyway. Furthermore, if Torbutton is set up correctly, the cache in the Tor state is isolated from the cache in the Non-Tor state, so stored .js files can't come back to bite you.

@_subject: Polipo automatic? 
Hi.
Just read a post made me think of this:
On Mac 10.5.2, with the Vidalia/Bundle, does Polipo automatically run after starting Vidalia or do I have to start it separately? I think it's now Polipo rather than Privoxy for v 0.2.1.24-0.2.7?
 --------------------
Certainly with the OSX Vidalia bundle I downloaded, it was enabled already: it's an option in Vidalia/Control Panle/Settings.

does anyone know if there is a config file option to turn off all caching in Polipo?
I am having a problem with variable PHP pages being cached, and would prefer not to have to add Cache-Control headers everywhere. The manual doesn't seem to allow for that eventuality.

@_subject: BIND down, weird IPs pop up on tor.log 
I assume you have a fixed IP and an Address line in your torrc?
Would restarting BIND make Tor try to guess its IP? In that case you could have triggered the bug in 0.2.1.23/24 which gave some of us with dynamic IPs severe problems - the IP guessed was random contents of memory changing every few seconds. It's fixed in 0.2.1.25 (an 0.2.2.10 alpha I'm told).
Just a thought - others know the workings better.

does anyone know why these changes to /Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor
should break it?
Polipo is started, but Tor isn't : "sh /Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor start" shows as a sleeping process.
StartService ()
    if [ -f $TORCMD ]; then
        if pid=$(GetPID Tor); then
            return 0
        else
        ConsoleMessage "Starting Tor Service"
# Tentative
# Start Polipo
# Making sure it is not running (I know it is not a best approarch)
        killall tor 2>/dev/null

    fi

I haven't changed the config file and I can still start Tor by su-ing to the tor user.

@_subject: GSoC Introduction - Extending Tor Network Metrics 
Hey everyone,
I'm Kevin Berry, one of the GSoC students working for Tor this summer. Originally from New Jersey, I'm currently a junior at Villanova University in Philadelphia. I will be guided by Karsten on "Extending Tor Network Metrics." My plans revolve around porting Ernie (the metrics portal software) to a dynamic web application. I will add a search feature to the *large* amount of relay descriptor data (for specific items like server names, characteristics), and automate the collection and publishing of a few high-level network statistics. If you haven't yet read my initial proposal, I'm including it here:  . The timeline was made a bit more specific since I submitted it. Lots to do!
I plan on hosting my GSoC blog and project at  . Since a bit of my project involves web development, I plan to have snapshots of my project hosted there. It's a dynamic dns domain pointing to a box at home, so I apologize if it is slow/unreliable at times. I'm usually idling in oftc and freenode as kjbbb. I've already met a few of you, but definitely feel free to drop me a line. I will be around a lot more often after finals end next week, so I will have time to set up, ask questions, and get ready to begin working this summer. I'm excited to be able to dedicate my full time to open source and Tor, so thank you Google and everyone else involved for giving me this great opportunity! It's good to read that people are working to improve Tor. Welcome.
However, that's the second unexplained reference to OFTC - do you mean
 ?
It's best not to assume that acronyms are understood by everyone...we don't all move in the same circles.

Thank you, I have a recollection of reading that section and not really understanding it - I think I would need a good understanding of how caching works and all the directives first. From what I read, you have to know in advance which URLs you don't want cached, and put them in uncachableFile. That's not really practical. But thanks for trying to help.
