HI ; i am a student in networking and security system, i working in a
project  to make a global private navigation to web by create a
distribution based in Ubuntu . the project will include more interesting
tools to make a secure connection with servers  like a private cloud
computing ,also a secure navigator 'TOR' ,  reprogramming the kernel by
adding a backdoor to diminutive the espionage  risks "PRISM" .I have a big
idea to make our navigator in a high level of security so i hope to join
the team. By the way I receive some propositions to continue my project in
university Laval "Canada" , university tel-aviv in "Israel" ...  but i
believe that "the tor project" have all the potentials to make a secure
navigation .So i ll be waiting a favorite answer to join your team , thank
you .
