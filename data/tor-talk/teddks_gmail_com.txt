IIRC, a few months ago someone set up a tracker as a hidden service,
specifically for this kind of thing. I didn't test it myself, but some
people reported success.

Sorry, I meant to imply that it was possible to have a torified or even
hidden tracker, answering the OP's question of "is it possible". Thanks
for the Deluge tip, it's my client too and as usual, it's incredibly
simple to configure!
I do see a possible risk here, though: How easy would it be for the
MAFIAA to run hostile exits that killed connections to trackers? They
(or their proxies, e.g., Media Defender and the like) seem exactly the
type to do this, and they definitely have the resources. So if Tor was
to be used as a method of bypassing tracker censorship, the trackers
should probably be advised to run their own nodes.

Not to sound tinfoil, but I would trust Google _far_ more than I would
trust riseup. With it's political agenda it's most definitely
compromised, and if it isn't now, it will be the instant the FBI can say
some ELF member uses it. Google may log everything, but that means that
google's logging a _lot_, and you won't be drawn under suspicion just by
using it. Good anonymity comes from blending into a crowd, and riseup
won't let you do that.
As always, this won't matter if you only use the account with encrypted
content. However, a lot of activists I've talked to think that the fact
that riseup uses SSL means "the account is encrypted", so I don't think
that'll be popular anytime soon.

If riseup was owned, it wouldn't be by a hacker. It would be owned at a
level that no lack of logging, disk crypto, or participation in the
community would help. It would be owned by a tap on the wire, a gag
order, and the "keys to the castle" for everything else.
I don't wish to impugn the riseup team in any way. I think they're doing
a great job, and doing something that's very needed for the activist
community. I'm sure they've got enough security on it to bar out just
about anything.
But I'm also sure they have lives that they care about, and I'm also
sure that if it came down to them handing things over to the FBI or
being caught up in the green scare, they'd do the self-preserving thing.
It's what anyone would do, and it's what I expect of them. I'm sure
they'd try to fight it however they could, but again, they aren't
exactly blending into the crowd. Their favicon is a red/black star, they
link to other radical sites, they provide email list to groups that are
probably on terror watchlists. They're most certainly in a spotlight, if
they aren't already wiretapped or subpoenaed. Sure, they may try to fight. But will they really go to prison so that
my email can be unread? They won't be going up for privacy, they'll be
seen by the masses of America as supporters of "eco-terror" or whatever
demon is the label of the day. And if they fight, they won't be fighting
for the 1st amendment, they'll be fighting against the PATRIOT act. Not
to mention that they've got limited resources, and can only keep up for
so long.
Again, don't get me wrong. The riseup team are all (probably, as I don't
know them) great people, and they're certainly providing a needed
service. But I don't expect them to take a bullet for me.
I would think that a gmail account, sending PGP-encrypted messages,
would be sufficiently under the radar. If sending PGP alone flags you,
then it could easily be steg'd into a picture. But on Riseup, you're
well on the radar to begin with, and that's troubling to me. Unless we
get into "can crack PGP", that should keep you safe from context scanning (and when I
mentioned sending only encrypted messages, I was speaking of PGP, to be
In short, I think Riseup is great, but I would love it a lot more if the
server had protection from the legal kind of compromising, possibly
through Tor as a hidden service. I wouldn't advocate using Riseup
because they profess to having good admin practices; admins can be
changed quite transparently for users, and you don't know if the Riseup
team is really running the show. Gmail can't context-scan encrypted or
steg'd email.
I advocate OTR every chance I get. It's really great: it's deniable,
it's authenticating, and it's available on all major (free or not) OS's.
It's fantastic, IMHO.

So anyone who was connected with Riseup will what, go underground,
you'll scatter the servers across the world and switch to only existing
as a Hidden Service? It doesn't really matter if you can't locate the
servers with Tor if the operators are already non-anonymous...
But if this could be pulled off, I would definitely support it 100%, and
I'd love using it. So maybe keep or-talk posted. :)

@_subject: Bypassing Internet Censorship 
FLOSS Manuals Release Circumvention Book, How To Bypass Internet
December 4, 2008, Amsterdam
A new book released by FLOSS Manuals, How to Bypass Internet Censorship,
describes circumvention tools and explains why you might want to use
them, and honestly describes the risks you must consider before
circumventing blockers or monitors. Blockers and monitors restrict
access to areas of the Internet, and this book describes simple
techniques for bypassing those restrictions. The book can be read or
downloaded for free as a PDF from flossmanuals.net, or you can purchase
a high-quality printed copy of the 200 page book through Lulu, an
on-demand printer, at  for ?10.83
The growth of the Internet has been paralleled by attempts to control
how people use it, motivated by a desire to protect children,
businesses, personal information, the capacity of networks, or moral
interests, for example. Some of these concerns involve allowing people
to control their own experience of the Internet (for instance, letting
people use spam-filtering tools to prevent spam from being delivered to
their own e-mail accounts), but others involve restricting how other
people can use the Internet and what those other people can and can't
access. The latter case causes significant conflicts and disagreements
when the people whose access is restricted don't agree that the blocking
is appropriate or in their interest. Problems also arise when blocking
mechanisms and filters reduce access to useful business, health,
educational, and other information.
Because of concerns about the effect of internet blocking mechanisms,
and the implications of censorship, many individuals and groups are
working hard to ensure that the Internet, and the information on it, are
freely available to everyone who wants it. There is a vast amount of
energy, from commercial, non-profit and volunteer groups, devoted to
creating tools and techniques to bypass Internet censorship. Some
techniques require no special software, just a knowledge of where to
look for the same information. Programmers have developed a variety of
more capable tools, which address different types of filtering and
blocking. These tools, often called "circumvention tools" help Internet
users access information that they might not otherwise be able to see.
This book documents simple circumvention techniques such as a cached
file or web proxy, and also describes more complex methods using Tor,
which stands for The Onion Router, involving a sophisticated network of
proxy servers.
How to Bypass Internet Censorship was written by eight writers in a
FLOSS Manuals 'book sprint' - a week-long intensive writing session, and
it also includes content from many different authors' previous works on
the subject.
How to Bypass Internet Censorship will always be available for free from
the FLOSS Manuals Website. Each sale of the book generates $2.50 (USD).
100% of this income goes back into the development of more manuals about
free software.

The best solution here is not to use non-free software as a general

the GNU swf decoder/player/interpreter/whatever, does not have these
flash cookies, and if it did, you could easily disable or find a way to
purge them. Really, though, a Torified browser should have as few plugins as

Gnash supports most flash I run into on the web, and I haven't had much
trouble with it, especially with later releases. More importantly, the
developers care about privacy, and if they stop caring, someone else can
pick up where they left off. That's a stark contrast with Adobe, who has
actively acted against user privacy on multiple occasions.
By the way, saying "free/open" is pretty redundant, isn't it? The Free

Or is the "free software is more privacy-safe" subthread the off-topic
one? I would also think that that is on-topic for any anonymity network

How about this:
TorProject has a paypal donations account that people (like those people
who cannot run a node, but wish to contribute) can send donations to.
Those donations, in turn, are requested by node operators who run
high-bandwidth, permissive-exit-policy (I'd think no more restrictive
than the default) nodes at cost to themselves. Additionally, TorProject
could host a list of node operators that either don't qualify for the
above request process or need more than it can offer to allow users to
donate directly to node operators. Another possibility (albeit much more extreme) is to allow a "donation
link" metadata item for Tor nodes. This removes any dependency on the
Tor Project handling funds.
Even if the funds are somewhat diminutive, I think this would provide a
bit of incentive to start running a node and to keep running a node in
the face of censorship.

was a "Donations" field in the metadata, much like we have operator's
email addresses (at their option). This would let people see which nodes
they're hitting up in Vidalia and send them some tokens of appreciation.
Why not? Certainly not all nodes will be dependent on donations, because
the current infrastructure has nothing supporting them. If a new system
introduces new nodes that are dependent on user support, that still
equates to new nodes.
Yes, people have free bandwidth which they can run Tor on. However, they
then have to deal with the _possibility_ of ISP/university/mom
complaints, and that acts as a deterrent. If a student was able to make
any money from free bandwidth, that would be a good incentive to start a
Tor node. If a website oper was able to make some money from free

water to start with. That creates a middle-man, and also creates a centralized weak point in
the donations system. That scenario could certainly come into play (a
lot of people donate to a certain node because that's the one with
advertising, and that node stays up via donations), but a more
decentralized system allows anyone in any country running a Tor node to
receive some support for it.
Why put one node online when you could put hundreds online, by creating
enough incentive to balance the potential risk of ISP complaints?

And indeed, they don't. I'm skeptical as well. I'm just broadcasting ideas, hoping that someone
with the experience at writing feature proposals is listening and
thinking that this is a good idea. Your scenario is much more
immediately doable.
I hope some at least would. Donations wouldn't be anonymous (unless the
great minds of the anonymity world could fix that bug...) for the most
part, though a "Donation Information" field isn't necessarily linked to
one currency -- there isn't anything stopping someone from putting an
eCache or eGold link in there.
There is, and it's far easier than modifying the infrastructure to
support a donations framework, so I suggest work gets on with that. I'd

The only things I see in the "Adversary Attacks" section that could be
an issue are fingerprinting attacks, and of course exploitation. What am
I missing? And is there any way to get the benefits of Torbutton without
any of the state-saving aspects? Like the previous poster, I have a
separated Firefox profile I use for Tor, so separation of Tor and
non-Tor state isn't an issue for me.
What would it take to split off the filtering/hardening aspects of
Torbutton from the state-watching part, and just have an independent
anonymity-enhancing addon? I'd rather not trust one piece of software
with all of my anonymity, so I want to keep my system separated the
old-fashioned way, with plugins/cache/history/cookies/javascript that
could be used against me. This way, even if Torbutton fails, I still
have a modicum of safety against some attacks.
My configuration passes the decloak engine test with flying colors,

The slippery slope here is the definition of "people who need it". I
used to run an exit node that accepted connections to traditional
BitTorrent ports, because I had no way of knowing if someone wanted to
download porn through Tor to be l33t or if someone wanted to share a
video of police brutality or something anonymously (I eventually stopped
because of the desire not to enforce my values on every node leading up
to mine).
Anywhere there is anything, there can be abuse. People can use your
restrictive exit policy to vandalize wikipedia or send spam. People can
use that exit to gmail to send threats to the president. There's no such
thing as "low-risk" anonymity.
That being said, however, you don't have much to fear from that. The EFF
would almost certainly have your back if it came to a legal fight,
you're a DMCA "safe harbor" (to my knowledge IANAL etc), and cops
typically do check to see if an IP is an open proxy before raiding it.

Certainly the reason for using Tor is not to magically protect your

used to compile (or verify their trustworthyness) are trustworthy?

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
Sorry, but this has been a long thread and I want to try to make sure I
understand something important.
Is it true or false that traffic was actually exiting through
gatereloaded et all?
I recall seeing that those nodes weren't marked as exits in the
consensus anyway. If that is the case, then all of John Case's arguments
related to super-secret movie-plot usages of Tor and servers running on
port 80 only accessible through gatereloaded et all seem to be

Is there an or-parliament list I should be on if I want to be an
Official Tor Project Legislator, making these *important policy
decisions* that affect Tor into the *infinite future*?
I know it's easier to send emails about something incredibly unimportant
to inflate one's own ego than it is to actually get shit done, but this
is ridiculous.

You're missing that Tor's goal is to separate identification from
routing, and that logging into authenticated systems using Tor is a
perfectly valid use of it. Not all uses of Tor are for the purpose of
obscuring your identity from the destination server. For example, nearly
all uses of Tor during the Iranian election protests fell into this
category (I suspect).
There's also a case to be made about revealing the least possible amount
of information. If you give a website your credit card information over
Tor+Torbutton, you're giving them objectively less data about you than
you would have if you had given them your credit card without Tor
+Torbutton. This may or may not be valuable information, but it's still
information. Personally, I do as much as I can over Tor, just because I
want to have a default-deny policy about my personal information.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Natty packages 
I think this needs to be publicized more -- I'm an Ubuntu and Tor user,
and I had no idea Tor was in Natty. I just modified my existing
configuration back to Maverick. I consider myself pretty well-updated,
since I follow the Tor blog and the Tor identi.ca account.
