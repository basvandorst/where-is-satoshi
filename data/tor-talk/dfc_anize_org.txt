What platform do you run tor on? And did you use a precompiled package or did you compile from source? One easy way to check and see if tor is running is to
telnet localhost socksport
where socksport is the port you configured in your tor config file. It is most likely 9050 unless you changed something.
You could also check your logs but the location is going to depend on how you installed tor. so i can not help much there...

@_subject: Tor status 
check your torrc for lines like the following:
 Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/log
Log notice file /var/log/tor/log
 Send all messages of level 'warn' or higher to /var/log/tor/warnings
Log warn file /var/log/tor/warnings.log
 Send all debug and info messages to /var/log/tor/debug
 debug-warn file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 Send all debug messages ONLY to /var/log/tor/debug
 debug-debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 To use the system log instead of Tor's logfile
The logfiles will give you information about the status of your tor installation. if you want to keep an eye on things as you use tor you could execute:
tail -f /var/path/to/tor/logfile
in a window and the tor logs will scroll by as they are presented.
If this is confusing send the relevant logfile entries from your torrc and I can tell you where to look for the status messages...
Is something not working or are you just curious to see what is going on under the hood?

@_subject: newbie questions (I've read the FAQ!) 
Hello Girogos,
The description to your questions can be found in the tor-spec.txt  file[1]. The file is not listed on the documentation page right now so  it is not that easy to find. I have answered your questions below:
[1] "Tor Protocol Specification" These lines describe the bandwidth of the tor server. The first entry  is the average bandwidth the server is willing to serve in the long  run. The second number is the bandwidth the server is willing to  forward in the short-run. And finally the third number is the estimated  bandwidth capacity of the node.
You can see a graphical representation of the bandwidth served in and  out as well as the reported capacity for the network as a whole and for  each router at:
the following is from section 7.1 of the spec:
    "bandwidth" bandwidth-avg bandwidth-burst bandwidth-observed
       Estimated bandwidth for this router, in bytes per second.  The
       "average" bandwidth is the volume per second that the OR is         to sustain over long periods; the "burst" bandwidth is the volume
       that the OR is willing to sustain in very short intervals.  The
       "observed" value is an estimate of the capacity this server can
       handle.  The server remembers the max bandwidth sustained output
       over any ten second period in the past day, and another sustained
       input.  The "observed" value is the lesser of these two numbers.
These numbers describe the bytes that the machine has sent and received  in 900 second intervals. The last number is the most recent 900 seconds  and the first number after (900s) is the oldest period where there is  data available.
These lines describe which routers are up and whether or not the  routers have been verified by the tor directory czars.
     "running-routers" space-separated-list
         A description of which routers are currently believed to be up           down.  Every entry consists of an optional "!", followed by  either an
         OR's nickname, or "$" followed by a hexadecimal encoding of the           of an OR's identity key.  If the "!" is included, the router is
         believed not to be running; otherwise, it is believed to be           If a router's nickname is given, exactly one router of that           will appear in the directory, and that router is "approved" by           directory server.  If a hashed identity key is given, that OR  is not
         "approved".  [XXXX The 'running-routers' line is only provided           backward compatibility.  New code should parse 'router-status'
         instead.]
     "router-status" space-separated-list
         A description of which routers are currently believed to be up           down, and which are verified or unverified.  Contains one entry           every router that the directory server knows.  Each entry is of           format:
               !name=$digest  [Verified router, currently not live.]
               name=$digest   [Verified router, currently live.]
               !$digest       [Unverified router, currently not live.]
           or  $digest        [Unverified router, currently live.]
         (where 'name' is the router's nickname and 'digest' is a           encoding of the hash of the routers' identity key).
         When parsing this line, clients should only mark a router as
         'verified' if its nickname AND digest match the one provided.
