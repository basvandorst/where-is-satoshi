You can perfectly achieve that without waiting for any change on Vidalia
side (which, IMO, should be handling this)
Use ssh client to bind a local port against a remote one (the Tor
control port).
Something like ssh -L 9051:localhost:9051 yourremoteserver should work
out of the box.

Hi Matthew.
It is in fact.  I'm pushing the newer version as we speak.
Thanks for the heads up!

You could implement any approach present at the package documentation.
     The 'But...'
     =======
     On the other hand, there could be a few situations in which you
    wont be able
      to use this configuration profile, some of them being:
      - You couldn't convince an admin to add you into the list of local
    system
        users allowed to control Tor
      - The Tor instance you're willing to control runs on a remote host
      - Some old manuscripts have recently revealed vulnerabilities on the
        unixsocket implementation, or simply you just don't wish to use
    it because
        you dislike the word 'unix' on 'unixsocket'.
     In this cases, or whichever ones you may find, you can still make
    use any of
      the following alternatives:
      1. If facing a local Tor daemon situation in which you are unable
    to connect
         for some reason to the system-wide Tor's Control Socket (as the
    example
         explained below), you can still launch a personal Tor session
    and manually
         configure Vidalia to use it.
      2. Enable Tor's ControlPort and enable CookieAuthentication in
    Tor's config,
        then grab the cookie file from /var/lib/tor/control_auth_cookie,
    profit!
      3. Enable Tor's ControlPort, get a hashed password at 'tor
    --hash-password',
        load back the output into the HashedControlPassword Tor's config
    field,
        profit!

< Just to clarify my last email >
Bare in mind the whole procedure I quoted before is required _only_ when
you are diverging from the packages default behaviour.
You wont have to do any of this in case you use your system-wide running
All this is explained carefully with details on the package
documentation I make reference before (README.Debian).
