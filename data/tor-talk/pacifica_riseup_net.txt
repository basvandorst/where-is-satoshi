@_subject: [tor-talk] Codename: TorBirdy 
Indeed TorBirdy expects the Tor Browser Bundle version of tor, not a system-installed tor. TorBirdy is set by default to listen on port 9150, which is the port for the Tor Browser Bundle.
So, by default, it will not work with a system-installed tor, which is port 9050. The only exception to this default scenario is in Debian, if you install the xul-ext-torbirdy package, which will instead use the system tor (port 9050) instead of the TBB tor (9150).
Else, you can configure TorBirdy in the network settings to simply use port 9050 instead of 9150 if you want to use system tor.
Hope this helps.

Eh, I'd hesitate to say "us". I'm _not_ advocating for using add-ons in TBB, I'm just looking for ways to quantify the damage to anonymity.
I've also got to strongly disagree here... if you're looking for anonymity and privacy, the "herd" is strong protection against that because trackers cannot single you out from the thousands of other users. If you are unique, then tracking you over the current session is trivial. Insofar that all Tor users look alike (I realize that is an oversimplified premise), tracking across sessions is also not fruitful.
And since it's Tor, we're not really trying to hide from the fact that we're using Tor... it doesn't make sense since the IP will always give you away.
Again, I can't reiterate enough... I'm not advocating for using add-ons as some have, because I do agree with the (afaik undisputed) logic that using add-ons in TBB harms your anonymity.

Hello afternoon / evening / morning tor-talk -- I am hoping that someone can point me in the right direction. I know it is well-discussed that adding Firefox add-ons to the Tor Browser Bundle decreases anonymity, but I would like to review the studies myself. I'm having trouble finding credible research where detection of add-ons has resulting in a significant decrease in anonymity... can someone please point me to those resources?
To be explicit, I am not concerned with "plug-ins" like Java or Flash, but rather "add-ons" like HTTPS everywhere or Privacy Badger.
Thanks in advance.

Thanks aka -- I'm familiar with the conventional wisdom that add-ons make you more unique... but I am really looking for any formal study or code PoC that perhaps identifies more direct methods of detecting add-ons. Perhaps it's different for every add-on, and it probably is, especially considering some add-ons may not be reviewed for security/privacy at all. So some library would probably need to be compiled and maintained to try to exhaustively detect all known add-ons, similar to fingerprint.js.
The current logic (AFAIK) would be: if websiteA.com hasn't developed a detection technique for Add-On-X, then it can't detect it. I suspect add-ons could be detected more directly, but I have not seen any study or code to support that yet.
To be clear, I'm not arguing that TBB's design logic is flawed here at all -- I know it's not, and I can think of a _lot_ of reasons why, a couple of which you listed. Anything that distinguishes you from "the herd" is "bad" to the extent it doesn't catastrophically compromise your But I'm still looking for something a bit more formal in terms of discussing a quantitative, or pseudo-quantitative impact on anonymity / privacy by add-on detection either in code PoC or academic research...
Thank you for your reply. I completely agree with TP's position on add-ons and often advocate for the same. Just playing devil's advocate... :)

The closest thing I'm aware of to a one-stop-shop to view the factors of your fingerprint would be Valve's fingerprint.js library:
It's definitely not sophisticated enough to meet most Tor users' needs, but it's a good start. It's also well documented and can easily be run To answer your question:
It's important to consider TBB's design... which is to make _all_ Tor Browser Bundle users look identical. This provides strong anonymity amongst other TBB users. It does not hide the fact that you're using Tor or the TBB, but attempts to hide you within the group to make each individual difficult to uniquely track. This is also the reason for the recent roll-out of the per-domain circuits, because third-party trackers could collude to correlate traffic and de-anonymize Tor users that way. This is also why Tor Project released the "slider" to pick from a handful of pre-defined security/privacy levels. Because of indirect detection of the myriad of potential browser configurations, individual configurations could inadvertently make people quite unique. So the slider helps to coalesce the potentially huge number of combinations to single digits, assuming that most people will be comfortable with a provided setting.
First, the default configuration of TBB is sufficient to make cross-session fingerprinting and tracking difficult (not impossible, especially if JS is enabled, but that has trade-offs of its own). Installing unique add-ons each session, would make tracking across sessions a little more difficult (albeit probably easier than the default TBB config since you would be, once again, unique...), at the expense of being unique during that session.
That practice would be almost universally discouraged, except perhaps for some imaginative fringe cases.
I think it's well known and understood that "adding add-ons to TBB" = "bad for anonymity", but I'd prefer to know "how bad", instead of just a binary good / bad.
Perhaps this want to know more resonates with others, and will warrant some research if it's not already been undertaken.
All the best,
