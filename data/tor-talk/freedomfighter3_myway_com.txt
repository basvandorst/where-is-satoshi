i have created new Software, SecureLoad, Peer-to-peer filesharing software using Tor Network.
  There is no other filesharing software which is designed to use Tor which i know of, so this might be the first of this kind.
Please let me know what you think. Where can i do some promotion for the software?

Thanks for your reply, see answers below:
  peers are stored in shared peer repository, initial peer repository is downloaded from boot-node. Peers have addresses (hidden services) so they can connect to each other
  select a directory to share, all files hased within and then the file meta is distributed into the network (no central repository)
  either do a file search (by name) or download a link, like an emule ed2k link .
  also you can download a "container" (list of files), so that files are bundled together with directory substructure, like a torrent file from bittorrent. you can also create a container file ".sdc"
General Info of how SecureLoad ius working:
   * each peer creates hidden service, so peers can connect to each other
   * each node is treated equally, no central repository. Exception: boot-node, which has a list of known nodes.
   * each node maintaines a list of known nodes/ peers, and a list of known shared files
   * when a peer shares files, this list is transmitted into the network
   * file searches are propagated through the network over multiple nodes. if you issue a search, many nodes will
     search their local copy of the global file share repository, so each search should give a complete result of what is there even if      there are many files    * The communication protocol is using the JSon format. The JSon message itself is zipped which reduces the overhead.
   * Data transmission is not zipped and binary data is not encoded in JSon. Compression is not used because zipped transfers      usually does not have advantages and  can be used to spread fake files (see emule fake files)
   * The GUI uses Java, as 3rd-party libraries (not shipoped with standard Java)  'jgoodies-common-1.8.0.jar' (gui library), 'jgoodies-forms-1.8.0.jar' (gui library), log4j-1.2.16.jar (logging library)
Any more questions? please :)

Thank you for spending time on this - I was thinking of such a piece
of software which could implement the bittorrent p2p filesharing
protocol but with .onion peers, in order to get rid of DMCA  and
copyright infringement complaints.
Can you provide more technical details? How does it work, how are
peers discovered, how are files shared, how do you initially discover
the files? is there a central repository for it and so on.

a link goes like this: sdc://|file|sampletextfile.txt|76|5508A134D3CF3F7F01518FDEFE5E1C60B04E8A65|/
  sampletextfile.txt      ->     filename,
  76      ->      filesize
  5508A134D3CF3F7F01518FDEFE5E1C60B04E8A65       ->     roothash
Hashing is done in a tree-style like tiger but a little different with 3 levels of hash:    Level 0: roothash
   Level 1: intermediate hash  (nests up to 100 nodes ( Level 2)
   Level 2: hashes 100 kb blocks
Hashing is using SHA-1.
The higher level hash is composed of the hashes of the lower level.
Exception roothash: root-hash is computed by hashing all Level-1 hashes plus appending the filesize.
With this way the filesize is "fixed" and cannot be tricked by malware.
If you give someone a download container you pass over a file which has ascii-content (json), the content looks like:
{"name":"Demo Container","files":[{"relativePath":"2014-01-08 15.52.12.jpg","rootHash":"2950185AC96CCC33F5428A046CAF64BE0D7D2662","fileSize":628079}]}

if I give someone a link to a file, are there hash in the link?
how does hashing work in your program and which hashes do it use?
Is your program computing an hash per file or several hashes / macs per
part of an file like torrent with tiger tree hash?

yes i have changed now to SHA-256 because it is said to be more secure, thank you.
Also i introduced a fourth Hash-level in the hash-tree (of 5k Blocks). They are only used now to build the higher level hashes, they are not transmitted. If needed, they can be transmitted also to do more fine grained validation.

Thanks i have learned a lot now. I also saw that Tribler has published a warning that security has not yet matured.
I think file sharing of small files should work, for big files people should not use tor if they have other sources available.

maybe I am paranoid, but could you implement an second hash computed
out of the file. SHA-256 would be perfect, because when you have
security in mind, NSA could break SHA-1. When you are using two hashing
algos than it is even harder to attack it.

Hi there,
thanks for your suggestion. I considered the proposal to have separate hashes computed for the files. I would not track separate hashes for the reason of possible programming errors, but for user purposis, e.g. if a users wants to check if a file contains a virus, using a webservice which takes file hashes.
I would consider such a feature but currently the software is not used by people, so no urge need to have this feature :)

I don't meant to change the hash funktion from SHA-1 to SHA-256, I
meant to hash the 100 KB blocks and the higher level hashes with SHA-1
and to provide a SHA-256 hash that is generated from the file itself
Because two hashes are more secure than one, even if one of them is
broken, because if someone can find a collision in one hash he can't
find a collision in the second at the same time.
The two hash method is only mode secure than a single hash, if someone
can't reverse calculate an information out of the hash. But SHA-1 is so
far I know only vulnarable to collisions at some specific conditions.
Maybe it will be mode secure to use RIPE-MD 160 for hashing the tree
hashes and provide a SHA-256 hash for the whole file too.
