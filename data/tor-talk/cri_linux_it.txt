@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 2.2.36-1 fails to include Firefox 13 
BTW,  is still advertising
2.2.35-12, so the automatic startup procedure is not detecting the new version.
Any reason for this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended method for updating an existing TBB 
Good question. My upgrade procedure goes like this (on linux, but that's not
- Close firefox and shut down tor
- Rename the old TBB folder
  mv /path/tor /path/tor.old
- Extract the new TBB package to /path/tor
- Remove the firefox profile from the newly extracted TBB and replace it with
  the one from my old TBB
  By "firefox profile" I mean:
  - the "/path/tor/Data/profiles.ini" file
  - the "/path/tor/Data/profile" folder
- Start tor, watch firefox checking compatibility of add-ons, and fix possible
  problems (never had so far).
This way, I can port my firefox customisations (bookmarks, adblock plugin, some
GUI tweakings in about:config) to the new TBB release.
Of course installing extra plugins and messing with about:config is discouraged,
unless you really know what you are doing.
Hope this helps!
