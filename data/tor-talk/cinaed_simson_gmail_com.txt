An untrusted HTTPS connection? Really?
Anonymity without security?

@_subject: [tor-talk] anonymous connection to private address 
Hi - I keep getting this message in my TBB log
   [warn] Rejecting SOCKS request for anonymous connection to private
address [scrubbed].
Why isn't the information regarding the source IP address being displayed?
How can I determine the source address so I can block it with iptables
on Linux?

Any chance using a secure version of TSL and getting rid of the known
insecure ciphers?
TBB by default has a maximum TSL version is 1 and minimum is 0.
And TBB is still using the well insecure cipher
  security.ssl3.rsa_fips_des_ede3_sha
Point your TBB browser to
  to see how bad TBB sucks at SSL.

Hi - I just downloaded
 tor-browser-linux64-4.0.8_en-US.tar.xz
 tor-browser-linux64-4.0.8_en-US.tar.xz.asc
and the public key used to sign file
  gpg: Signature made Thu 09 Apr 2015 10:44:53 AM PDT using RSA key ID
  gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
doesn't exist on the key signing web page

Opps - ignore this message. Key ID is the last 8 characters.
The primary fingerprint appears to match but this no fingerprint for the
RSA signing key of D40814E0. Where can I find it?
