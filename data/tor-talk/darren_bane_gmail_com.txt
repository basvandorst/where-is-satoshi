Why aren't you installing Tor via MacPorts also?  The port is up to date, AFAIK.

Ok, changing the source code is a good reason (sorry, I had to ask
because you'd be surprised how many people don't have one).
Looking at the tor-devel port, the following environment variables are
set before configure:
There is more in the portfile, but these look like likely suspects for
your build failure.

There may be a better alternative, but here's how I would do it:
1.  Run squid on your machine at home (say on port 3128)
2.  ssh tunnel work:3128 to home:3128
3.  Add "HttpProxy localhost:3128" and "HttpsProxy localhost:3128" to your torrc
