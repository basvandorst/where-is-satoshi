I extended my statistics a bit:
Now you can also see, how many connections are used to search for  profiles via an email-address. The detection is done by the following  regular expression:
No data beside the host name is saved, especially not the email  It shows that at the moment between 4 and 20 % of the connections are  used for these requests, mainly at flickr, what explains their high  ranking in the general connections. It can be assumed that most of  searches are done automatically by profilers, that scan "web 2.0"  sites for existing profiles with their email-address-databases, in  order to build up a relation database. (Examples:  ,   By using unencrypted  connections over Tor they violate their privacy policies, I guess.
Also it shows how interesting it is for email-address harvesters to  run an exit node on their own. Each 100'000 connections you will have  collected at least 5'000 email addresses! So the profilers feed the  spammers? :-)

There are no "compromised" or "safe" countries as there is no hostile  or friendly network. Any concepts based on such assumptions are doomed.

Thanks for the link. That does not contradict to what I said. Who did  this study? I cannot rely my security concept on some human estimates.  It's interesting, though. There are differences, but no country is  "dark green" or even "cyan". This study is more a journalistic than a  scientific one, since the information it is based on is not always  comparable and does not represent all the characteristics that are  important for privacy. Maybe Greece is just better in hiding the

Wow, icy wind here. For me this situation has something tragicomical.  Sorry for disturbing you serious life.
I think it's always a good thing to move towards less assumptions and  more knowledge. And please be more humble and don't speak as "we".  There were at least several people appreciating the stats.
So? I'm not looking at criminals but general usage patterns, "abuse"  and side-effects. I'm doing this for my own, but I think it's fair to  share it.

They are locking down _physical_ access to the servers, they don't  switch them off. But this might be a preparation for a "harmonization"  during the games. Also Chinese people are surprised by this, as you  can read at the end of the article.
A Chinese friend of mine told me, Tor is quite common in China in  order to circumvent the Great Firewall. (Interestingly he didn't care  about anonymity at all, just access.) So it worked at least until  recently. There has been a report that Tor has been blocked, but it  seems not to be true:
If you want to be on the safe side, bring Tor on your USB stick and  find out a non-listed bridge IP.
OpenVPN works as well.

Of course you can. And if you are able to bring yourself under the top  100 of 500 exit nodes in one day, you can solve it even in two days.  Just use a different destination IP for each exit node, then you don't  need the bisection method. ;-)
But you are right. Maybe top 100 is too much and I should switch to a  top 20 or so?

Sebastian Hahn:
The question is not, if it adds value to Tor, but if it adds value in  general. And if this is the case I cannot tell yet, and I claim you  can't either. It's just a first idea.
The stats are port specific, so they are independent of exit policies.  Since I assume most users don't use specific exit nodes, I believe  it's a fair assumption that the stats are more or less representative.
So it doesn't tell you anything, that flickr.com for example makes  more than 5% during the last days, while the next host is below 1%?  Massive abuse is as much a reason as a bug in my eyes.
I doubt this "well-known fact" depends on wether somebody is  publishing stats. You always have to assume, that a Tor relay might be  logging, and so do the investigators. If they become active depends  then on wether they were successful before in getting useful logs. My  logs are not useful for backtracing, so I don't contribute to this  Define "malicious". The key feature of Tor is, that it doesn't rely on  the trustworthiness of the relay operators, else it would be useless.  So I think the log issue is being overrated.
My motive is that of any researcher: learn something. And yes, I do  feel that I have the right to know what people are doing, but I don't  have the right to know what a person is doing. That's a big  difference. The ice gets thin if the Tor-FAQ argues: "we feel that  we're doing pretty well at striking a balance currently", although we  don't have any idea how much abuse is currently happening. (You cannot  estimate it by the number of complaints.)
There are always side effects, so what side effects does Tor have?  Maybe Tor in the end reduces privacy instead of improving it, if you  look at the big picture? (For example because it enables data-miners  to anonymously break their privacy policies?) If we don't dare to look  what actually happens on the wire, with the excuse that Tor is about  anonymity, we risk to do the wrong thing. And the good thing is: most  of the transport-layer data is already anonymized. If you make studies  in the normal carrier networks, you always have to make a big effort  to anonymize the data before giving something out. With Tor exit  connections that's a lot easier, since the source is already unknown.
One could even take up this provocative position: Everybody can  operate a Tor node. So everything that a Tor node sees, is public by  definition, as it can be seen by a random non-trustworthy person. So  it doesn't make a difference from a security point of view, if any  information of the traffic is made public. What will become public  then is information which is "lost" anyhow. P2P encryption is  essential for sensitive data, with Tor even more, and making all info  public would just make that very clear to everybody.

People using webmailers like gmail.com don't even have a choice how  their mail gets assembled. But you have a choice to switch your mailer  to a current one. I suggest you to try out "mutt".

H D Moore:
Exactly, FUD was also the first thing that came to my mind while  reading it. What about the whole research area, that is doing similar  analyses on normal non-anonymous backbone traffic?
I think this is a very interesting work and exactly what is needed.  Although, these guys obviously have a lot of sensitive data sitting on  some harddisks, which needs a very careful handling. (Still better  than if that data came from non-Tor traffic.) Somebody has to watch  them, while they work with that data, and to make sure that only data  is kept that is really necessary for their work. (Keeping the first  150 bytes of every packet sound like more than necessary.) So I wonder  why their university didn't want to care about that.

@_subject: Exit node connection statistics 
I don't know if somebody did this before, but I think it is quite interesting, to which hosts most of the exit connections go to. So I set up a statistics script creating a list of the top 100 hosts each day to which Tor users connect to over my node (only for ports 80 and 443).
Besides just being interesting, this can also show potential security problems on the top hosts which are being exploited over Tor. For example, during the last weeks rapleaf.com was always at the top, and they keep a huge email-address database. This is probably no incident.
The log data necessary for this is being deleted after one day not to compromise the anonymity of the users.
I decided to make this accessible through a hidden service only, since I don't want to influence the exit node usage behaviour. This is the address:

Jan Reister:
I would like to see a discussion about this.
So you'd prefer using exit nodes that keep that information for their  own? Why? Or do you blindly trust all other Tor operators until they  show some "bad" behaviour?
I'm not a friend of two-classes knowledge, and what a Tor node  operator can know, everybody can know. Else it's nothing but security  by obscurity.
Can you explain what the threat scenario is for what I'm doing?
In order to advocate Tor it is said that the advantages outweigh the  disadvantages, and I agree in general. But I think we know too little  about the usage behaviour to make this a strong argument. How much of  Tor traffic is "illegal"? For me personally it would be fine if even  99% is some illegal file sharing or email-address harvesting, if in  return just one Chinese blogger is rescued from going to jail. But for  others it might be different. I think it's the wrong approach to just  close our eyes and say "we don't want to know". Surveys on usage  behaviour are not generally threatening the anonymity of the users but  can help to make the Tor experience better.
My personal motivation is that I fully and actively support anonymity  in the net, especially for people in authoritarian states, but I don't  want to spend my time and efforts for people abusing Tor to download  the latest movies because they don't have the balls to do it directly  or for spammers who farm for email-addresses. So I'd like to get an  idea how the ratio between the two use-cases is and if there is  something I can do to improve the situation. I think everybody who  supports the usability of Tor by operating a node has every right to  try to gather some information about that. And I don't want to keep it  for myself but share it with everybody.
I'm not argument-resistant. So tell me your views.
Best regards.

I just log the exit connections (standard info log of Tor), which is  not of much use for investigators, as they have this information  already if they found the exit node.
