@_subject: [tor-talk] Music para Anarchists 
If it's about bandcamp, the alternatives are rare for musicians.
Alternatives are possible, but real replacements have to be
developed, or maintained yourself. We have seen leftist/anticap
rap on itunes because no real thought process was involved
in distributing the music.
Some long selfdistributing artists have switched to hosted
solutions after decades doing it as a single person, some
collectives manage to do it on their own for long time.
The issue is too offtopic for tor-talk in my opinion as it focuses
more on problems like copyright, art distribution, etc.
