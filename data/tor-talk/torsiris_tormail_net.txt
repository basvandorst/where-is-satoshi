I saw a conversation about wget and I'm wondering if wget is save to use.
I know about DNS leaking but could there be another privacy concern?
Can wget put the real IP in a header for example? I guess it can't but
does someone know for sure?
Thanks a lot!

How can I check what information wget is transmitting? I used wireshark
and filtered to see only the traffic sent from wget to localhost:8118 but
I'm not a network expert and I don't know how to interpret the data.
Anybody has deeper network knowledge?

I cannot confirm that wget (v1.12) is sending any DNS resolve when using
it this way:
wget --proxy --execute=http_proxy= -c
Wireshark does not show any UDP traffic.
I will check out curl. I like the idea of not using a http proxy in between.
Thanks for the post. :-)
