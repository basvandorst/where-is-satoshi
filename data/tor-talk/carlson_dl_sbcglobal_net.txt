I am using Firefox 5.0 on my Windows XP computer with the Vidalia 0.2.12
package. It had been running fine using Torbutton 1.40 which (I believe)
was updated by the last Vidalia update.
I usually leave Torbutton disabled but today I tried to enable it to go
to a hidden website, and it caused Firefox to hang while a script tried
to find a missing .js file in my Firefox default profile extensions folder.
I isolated the problem to be associated with using Torbutton, so I
deleted Torbutton and re-installed it.  Then Torbutton still hangs
Firefox looking for the same missing js file.  Firefox works ok with
Torbutton disabled, but I cannot access hidden websites and I suspect
that I may not be actually using Tor.
Does anyone have a suggestion either on cleaning up the Torbutton
problem or configuring Firefox to use the Tor network correctly without
Torbutton.  I tried searching for the last choice on the Tor website,
but that choice did not jump out at me.
Thank you.

As a legal taxpaying US citizen, I can attest to the fact that 'innocent

that some former employer was wrong and I am, in fact, innocent.  Same
for other Federal Agencies, especially when a serious crime is
suspected.  If you are willing to risk having to prove that you are
innocent, fine, take that risk. Many people do not want to take that risk, and they may not want to

In the Windows download section there is a variation called Vidalia

Windows version of Firefox is expected to behave nicely.  As a Windows
user, this is what I use.
I notice, however, that there is no comparable package for Linux,
although there is a link to another page
 which I
suppose means something to Unix users.
I believe that the main difference between the version of Firefox in the
Tor Browser Bundle and the version that most people use is that that
version is 'portable' in the sense that it does not need to be
'installed' to run.  I think that same 'portable' version of Firefox is
also available directly from Mozilla if you know where to find it.  Does
someone know whether it is available from Mozilla in a Linux version?
If so, then perhaps for your particular case the version found in the
Tor Browser Bundle is not needed.

I would like some advice about accessing Tor through public wi-fi networks at airports, hotels, Starbucks and Mc Donalds.? I did not find information about this that ordinary people could understand on the torproject faq page.
I would suppose that, in general, they keep logs which probably include MAC addresses and access times, durations and whatever.? This could be used by either police or criminals to track use of my computer around the globe.? Also, some of these networks use the technique of blocking all access until an attempt is made to use http, whereupon they hijack the attempt to redirect to their log-in page.? Then, if the log-in is successful, they finally allow whatever traffic they consider acceptable from, I suspect, that particular MAC address.
Is this conjecture all wet, or am I correct that I am probably compromised if I use public wi-fi?
Is there a way to use public wi-fi safely?

I have noticed in recent months a change in the behavior of the exit
relay I have set up on my computer.
I often have the bandwidth usage graph visible on my desktop. In the "Olden Days" the incoming and outgoing traces generally followed
each other pretty closely, but now there are "Bursts" of outgoing
activity that are not matched to incoming traffic.  They have recently
become much more frequent.  I try to update when new releases become
available, and I am currently running Tor 0.2.3.22 rc on Windows 7.
I do not have any local activity correlated to these bursts that I am
aware of.
Is this behavior expected or have I been infected by some botnet?

I think that I remember reading somewhere that all packets come in only
one size so an interloper would have the task of counting packets and
then trying to match to other data streams with the same number of
packets in some time window.  Since the encryption would be different on
the other stream it is still not very easy.  Maybe Tor randomly throws
in some extra packets now and then to make life more interesting.
