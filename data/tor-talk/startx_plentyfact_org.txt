@_subject: webdav as hidden service? 
i was wondering if anybody has tried to set up a webdav directory as a hidden service?
on the server site this should be relatively straight forward: webdav is technically nothing else then a http service
and apache/mod_webdav would handle that probably the same way
it would handle the vhost for a hidden service.
however, is there any webdav client which could be used for that?
firefox does afaik not support webdav (at least not on linux)
and i would have no idea how to torify nautilus (gnome).
or are their other objections why this would not work?

@_subject: torwatch - a little script to visualize traffic of a tor node 
yesterday evening i got a bit tired of staring at all the numbers in
my /var/lib/tor/state file, so i opened a beer and wrote this little
script i called torwatch (for now).
you can get it from here: and see it in "action" here: maybe somebody else finds that useful, i might do some more work on
it next week.
from the torwatch README file: "torwatch is a script to visualize the traffic of a tor node. it is
written in lua and uses the GD graphics library to draw the graphs.
toewatch 0.1 was written over a pint of lager in october 2010, so
please do not blame the author if you find it incomplete, buggy or
i could not come up with a better name yet, if yoy have a brilliant
idea, let me know.
torwatch is released unter the GNU Public Licence v3.

that was my first thought, too. it might be that they mix up tor
relays/exit nodes with hidden services?

@_subject: TorFaq on https for hidden services ( was: Hints and Tips for 
im starting this as  a new thread, as my question is only inspired by
the discussion above.
in the TorFaq
(  ) it says:
  "Why is it better to provide a hidden service Web site with HTTP
  rather than HTTPS access?   Put simply, HTTPS access puts the connecting client at higher risk,
  because it bypasses any first-stage filtering proxy.. "
the answer in the FAQ refers to privoxy. so i wonder now: is this
answer obsolete meanwhile? or is it still the general recommodation to
run hidden services without https? is the server (hidden service)
privacy threatened by using https too in any way?
the FAQ also says:
  "These objections all apply to HTTPS, TLS, SSH, and generally all
  cryptography over Tor, regardless of whether or not the destination
  is a hidden service"
which i think is causing some confusion.

@_subject: [tor-talk] presentation about tor and onion routing? 
does anybody know a good presentation about using
tor and onion routing, targetting users ( not developers ) which can be
modified and used for talks?
i found a few things on slideshare.net but either download was disabled
or it was onion routing geek talk.
