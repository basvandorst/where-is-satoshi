I've been using the TBB 2.2.33-2-Windows for the past week or so.
Since this morning when the browser goes to the home page -
check.torproject.org - it says "Sorry. You are not using Tor" and states my
"...IP address appears to be: 38.229.70.31".
This IP is always the same no matter how many re-starts of TBB I make. I
notice the IP resolves to sergii.torproject.org
I have also tried checking "My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network"
but this makes no difference.
Should I be concerned about this ?
Any advice would be most appreciated.
