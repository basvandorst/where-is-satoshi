@_subject: Circuits and connections qu 
I believe when an app opens that is utilizing tor, a new circuit is initiated, yes?
If one app already has a connection open via tor, and you then open another (different) app that also tries to open a connection through tor to a different IP and using a different protocol, does that new connection go through a different circuit?

Based on the wiki, I'd say it does not open a new circuit.  Correct?

Is this a problem?  Should I stop using tor?
Does it mean there is a bad node?  If so, is it
skipping that node?
Is it to do with the release of v0.1.2.19?

@_subject: how much does opera leak? 
To answer my own qusetion, Privoxy does npt prevent the dns leak, according to one of the comments below:
This does not solve the problem! I logged all packets with wireshark and still got plain DNS requests. I tried setting up privoxy with opera again, but I still got DNS leaks. I found out that the problem is not Polipo or Privoxy, it's Opera itself because Opera doesn't support SOCKS proxy! Thus Opera always has to do DNS requests itself.
See here:

@_subject: how much does opera leak? 
Mmm. I just tried Wireshark with Opera-9.25 for linux with privoxy + tor.  I'm a novice with wireshark, just set it to my ethernet interface and ran it with the default settings.
With Firefox not going through Tor, wireshark showed very obvious DNS requests in blue. But with Opera via tor and firefox shut down, there were no such blue DNS requests visible - only TCP.
Maybe I need to set a particular filter on wireshark to see leaked dns requests from Opera via Tor, or should these show up in brilliant blue anyway?

@_subject: Segfaults on tor-0.2.12-alpha and  tor-0.2.0.34 
This is driving me nuts. tor compiles fine but segfaults soon after starting. I have googled and found similar complaints but no solution.
I tried tor-0.2.12-alpha after tor-0.2.0.34 showed this problem since the changelog to the unstable versions refers to fixing a segfault on starting.
But unstable also shows exactly the same problem. By contrast, v0.1.2.18 built on dsl and run without these issues some time ago, but that is quite old.
Details: tor-0.2.0.34 and tor-0.2.12-alpha compile fine on Damnsmalllinux  using gcc-3.3.5 (old I know).  Installed in /opt/tor against libevent-1.3e and openssl-0.9.8g which were also built and installed in that prefix.  libc is also old - think Debian Woody.  Not running in daemon mode.
Here is what is is printed to the terminal:

PS: BTW deleting ~/.tor before running gets rid of this:
Feb 21 21:06:30.734 [notice] Couldn't read /home/dsl/.tor/cached-descriptors; trying to load routers from old location /home/dsl/.tor/cached-routers.
But still segfaults and same messages re tor26, morial etc, so that's not it.

Thanks Nick - I have it working now anyway. What I did:
This gcc on Damnsmallinux is an "extension" built (mounted actually) in /opt/compile-3.3.5.  This also contains a lot of headers and libs corresponding to lib versions in the dsl base (which contains very few headers), including headers for quite old openssl static libs. Normally one points LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS at these in /opt/compile to provide an enriched build environment.
I had built more a recent openssl and installed it in /opt/tor with the intention of compiling and running against that.
I had LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS pointed at both sets of openssl libs.
When I just pointed LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS at my newer openssl version in /opt/tor before compiling the segfault on running tor went away.
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/tor/local/lib -L/opt/tor/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/tor/include -I/opt/tor/local/include"
./configure  --prefix=/opt/tor --build=i686 --with-openssl-dir=/opt/tor/local/lib --with-libevent-dir=/opt/tor/lib
Theory: Maybe some version conflict between a shared lib in /opt/compile and on the base system - one at compile time and the other at runtime?  I think openssl may not have been the culprit however since those are static - libcrypto.a and libssl.a

@_subject: Lynx leaks DNS 
I realize this needs a fix not a workaround, but if a workaround is enough for now you could try running lynx via proxychains --> tor Proxychains might grab all the DNS requests.
You could also probably leave privoxy in the proxy chain or test it with and without.
I haven't tried this with lynx, but proxychains does work with tor.

Is it possible this alleged jump in the numbers of relays is partly driven by the tbreg/Taobao thing?  Perhaps this same technique is being used more widely than is realized with relay nodes on zombied machines having names other than 25tbreg.  Just a thought.

Well, there is tiny and light web server  and there is non-php, non-mysql blogging software such as  that uses only bash plus standard utils.  I suppose it wouldn't be hard for the tor-ramdisk folk to add progs like those, think Damnsmalllinux (which ships with monkey server).
What I don't know about however are what security risks introducing monkey server would bring and how those should be handled.  Clearly there would have to be a persistent directory containing the files to be served.
