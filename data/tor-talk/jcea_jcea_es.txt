Hash: SHA1
OKCupid doesn't allow you to log in. The error is "password invalid".
Geocaching.com allows you to login and browse, but when posting
something, or registering a new found/not found, etc., you get a "non
anonymous proxies allowed". This is a very recent movement.
Interestingly enough, my outgoing IP is shared with a non-exit TOR node,
so they guess (wrongly) that I am using TOR because, probably, they are
banning all IPs in the TOR directory, being exit nodes or not.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "*.onion" performance tru "onion.to" 
Hash: SHA1
I am thinking about deploying a few "*.onion" services, and I am
getting a quite surprising result: accessing the services from the
open web via "onion.to" proxy is *FAR* faster that going TOR native.
What am I doing wrong?.
Example of accessing "burninetliliito5.onion"
Via "onion.to" proxy service: 3.44 seconds.
Via TOR native: 9.21 seconds.

I was not aware of this TOR compilation option. Thanks.
I was wondering if would be possible to implement access to Hidden
Services WITHOUT running a TOR node at the same time. What I have in
mind is something like a local (in my own machine) proxy that do
trasparent proxy for any standard webpage but go thru TOR for
"*.onion" domains. Reading about how Hidden Services work, seems to be
doable. Connecting directly to the rendezvous point. No client anonymity.
Would this be something to pursuit?.

Can I upgrade from 0.2.2.x WITHOUT touching "torrc"?. Or should I
review it line by line?.
Please, somebody change the color schema to something with better
contrast between versions :)

Oh, nice!.
I am interested in some python projects myself. Do you know if there
is something out there?. Particularly:
1. Python (local machine) proxy to access hidden services without
installing TOR on the machine.
2. DNS resolution via TOR, without installing TOR.
3. Maybe, a Python proxy to create hidden services without installing
TOR. This point could be detrimental to TOR ecosystem, nevertheless,
since a server using TOR would be "nice" if giving back.
I am interested in easing the entry barrier to access hidden services
for regular unskilled users, and I am thinking about writing this
proxy myself, but low level protocol details are available only on
sourcecode :-?. In this particular situation, I care about hidden
service anonymity, not client anonymity.
