@_subject: [tor-talk] Correct way to upgrade Tor in Linux 
I am Linux user for almost 10 years. I am Debian user, and I am use to
update software the Debian way using apt/aptitude (confortable with
yum too for other distros). However for Tor Browser Boundle I don't know
what would be the best way to upgrade.
As a newbie with Tor, what I am doing is deleting the previous
installation and installing it again. However, what should I do if
would like to backup the bookmarks and not loose them between
Thank you

Hi all,
I am learning Tor an trying to use it more every day. One problem that
I have is that when I browse for videos in Youtube using Tails or Tor
Browser Boundle I can not view all the videos. HTML5 does not fully
supported for Tor Browser.
A thing I normally do when browsing the web using Debian that does no
support HTML5 is install the plugin Download Helper to download the
videos so I can watch them offline. That works very good. I would like
to know if there is any risk using Download Helper? Here is the link to the plugin:
Best regards,

Nice :). That explains why I could watch some videos embebed in Twitter
and not in Youtube.
Anyway, youtube sucks to bad it is too popular. Best regards,

There are some videos I can't see even this way.I think it must be
something releted to codecs. The browser is not fully supported:
We only have HTMLVideoElement and  WebM VP8 supported. H.264, Media
Source Extensions, MSE & H.264 and MSE & WebM VP9 are not supported.
Not sure what it is, but that might explain why some videos are not
supported this way.

Agree, it would be very nice to be able to have an easy way to download
videos. Download Helper does a great job for non technical users, but I
have no idea how problematic it can be in terms of privacy.
