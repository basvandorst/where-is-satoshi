Hi all,
I'm running a Tor relay in my FreeBSD VPS (Virtual Private Server). All works fine but the second day I recieved a complaint about some "torrenting activity". Since then I only permit ports 80 and 443 (http, https) using ExitPolicy directive.
Anyway my host provider ( seems unhappy hosting a VPS with anonymous proxy runninf as Tor is. They don't want it, that's plain. I'm trying to explain to them as best as I can, but I'm not sure they understand. I've been involved in web-hosting industry in the past... so I fear is possible they interrupt the service if I don't what they want.
In that sense, at present I'm searching another BSD VPS provider. The only one I know (aside of  is  They're reliable and serious... but they're located (as  in USA; and the web-host providers in USA seems to have iron hand when they listen about proxies, anonymous and so on.
Do you know another BSD VPS reliable provider?

Hi Andrew,
I know the links, thanks anyway. They're so useful.
In fact it seems they ( don't allow "open proxies", not anonymous proxies: Do you allow IRC, torrents?
We do not allow IRC servers, bittorrent, open proxies, or any other software that can degrade our network performance or allow for abuse.
But after explaining to them that:
* it's not an OPEN proxy because I only permit port 80 and 443 (http and https) and no more
* I've limited the bandwidth (using BandwidthRate and AccountingMax directives) to assure the impossible degradation of the network performance
... they allow me to run Tor proxy. So, good for me and Tor network! For the moment I will stay will them.

We will see then.
Meanwhile I'm so prudent: I'm searching another BSD VPS provider here in my country (Sweden).

Yes Anders, I know. I've been involved in web host industry (as a sysadmin and Security Officer) the last three years. I know a lot about this business. They (web hosting providers) appreciate a lot when the costumer offers good attitude and collaboration, as my case is.
I hope all will be fine for long time. If not, there are a lot of good options out there.

The approach described in the official Tor project documentation is excellent from my humble point of view. As a web-hosting sysadmin I was I only commented that normally they appreciate a lot when the costumer shows good attitude. What "normally attitude" means? That's the key point: it depends on the web-hosting company and their support system/dept.
Andrew, if you want I can send to you (private email) my tickets exchange with my provider support dept. to show you what and how I've said to them.

To get your own IP space isn't a trivial process, nor cheap. Use the next link as a starting point to know something about: You shouldn't confuss the people. Get your own IP space it's only possible for enterprises and even if you?re an enterprise you need a complex network engineering behind you.
