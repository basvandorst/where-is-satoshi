To help clarify things, it sounds like you're wondering if file sharing
could function as a hidden service inside the tor network?

Hi Hogan and all,
I'm trying to install Tork on my Kubuntu 6.06 machine. I'm not a C
programmer, just script langs and much assembler level work a long time
ago. I've followed the instructions to install from cvs, had to install
"make", "autoconf", "automake", and "gcc" when they were not found. When
I do the "./configure" I'm stumped with an error "C compiler cannot make
executables" Can anyone help on this? Is it a file permission/owner
problem or some such thing?

Hi Mark, everyone,
As an US citizen and Tor user I fully agree with you Mark. I've been
greatly saddened the past few years to see our constitutionally
declared freedoms eroded away by a corrupt government. While there are
plenty of us who are still alert and doing what we can, the vast bulk
of of US population reminds me of the sheep in Orwell's "Animal Farm".
Concerning Tor and the Internet,I think it's extremely important that
we find and maintain secure, private means to communicate and make use
of the Web.  My hat is off to the developers of Tor and other software
aimed to keep us free.
