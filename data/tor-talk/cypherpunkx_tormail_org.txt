@_subject: [tor-talk] problem when using Vidalia to connect to a running tor 
I've got a system tor (0.2.3.25) running with the following torrc:
TransPort 9050
ControlPort 9051
SOCKSPort 0
HashedControlPassword xxxxxxxxx
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/.tor
as soon as I start Vidalia (0.2.20) which is provided with the appropriate
ControlPort password, I get these log entries:
[notice] New control connection opened.
[notice] New control connection opened.
[notice] Tor 0.2.3.25 (git-17c24b3118224d65) opening log file.
[notice] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050
[warn] Could not bind to 127.0.0.1:9050: Address already in use. Is Tor
already running?
[warn] Controller gave us config lines that didn't validate: Failed to
bind one of the listener ports.

[notice] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050
[warn] Could not bind to 127.0.0.1:9050: Address already in use. Is Tor

(every 61 seconds the log grows..)
Vidalia Error popup:
Error Applying Settings
Vidalia was unable to apply your Advanced settings to Tor.
Unable to set option: Failed to bind one of the listener ports.
Why does Vidalia try to reconfigure the existing system tor instance after
connecting to it via the ControlPort?
Why does it try to open a SOCKSPort on 9050? (~/.vidalia/torrc does not
seem to be relevant)
How can I avoid this problem?
thanks for your help!
