@_subject: [tor-talk] canvas fingerprinting 
Hello Torproject, could you publish the funcionality (or develop an add on for the funcionality) of giving back an empty string in case of canvas webgl fingerprinting. Then all Firefox users would be protected from unique id and Tor users wouldn't be identified on this way?
Bye Susanne
