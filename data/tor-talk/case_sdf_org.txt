@_subject: [tor-talk] Running tails headless ... virtualbox  ... 
I have a colo'd server that I want to run tails on.
I do not have physical access to the server, nor does the server have KVM attached - just a headless box in a cabinet somewhere.
So if I boot the tails ISO in virtualbox ... can I then ssh to the tails system and use Tor from there ?
Perhaps I need to dump the ISO filesystem, make some changes (like enable sshd, etc.) and then re-make the ISO ?
Any pointers or comments ?
Tails is really fantastic - the ability to go from zero-to-ToR in a few mmoents inside of vmware or virtualbox, etc., is fantastic, but not all systems have

Hmm... in recent vmware, I simply choose:
System > Preferences > Monitors
and it "just works".  That's not the case in Virtual PC ?

In my case I don't have any images, nor anything to migrate, etc. - I just create a new instance every time there is a new tails iso released.
I guess I have to tell it how much memory and how much disk space (0.1 GB) to allocate, and give it the location of the ISO, but that's it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Running tails headless ... virtualbox ... 
For this application, I do not need (or want) any GUI at all, so I can skip the framebuffer and no need to VNC in, etc.
So when you say "shell in as usual", I am not sure what you mean - there does not appear to be an sshd, and tails boots to GUI with no choice given to boot to console or other modes, etc.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Did we decide about bad exits ? Where does bittorrent 
A year or so ago we had a fairly rough thread here wherein it was proposed that certain combinations of open ports would be labeled as "bad exits", regardless of actual behavior.  For example, it was proposed that running only TCP 21,23,80 (for instance) would be considered "bad".
I am not interested in reopening the debate, but now that some time has passed, I *would* like to find out if this policy was ever codified and enacted ?  If so, can it be published ?
My specific question is, does merely allowing bittorrent traffic[1] on an exit qualify as a "bad combination" ?  It appears not to, but ...
[1] OB: bt traffic hurts the tor network.  You should not use bt with tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] variable speed limits on ports ... 
Let's say I run an exit node, and I have a 10 Mb/s connection.
I join up, run for a while, get qualified as a good exit, speed checks out at 10, and so on.  All is well.
But then let's say that, at the OS level, I rate limit one of the TCP ports I allow to exitto a much lower level - let's say I allow:
and 22,80,443 go full bore at 10 Mb/s, but I rate limit 6667 to 1 Mb/s.
How does this get categorized by the Tor network ?  Do I continue to show as a 10 Mb/s exit node ?  Do I get labeled as a bad exit ?  Perhaps lots of exits do this and it is an accepted practice ?
I *think* the speed is tested via Tor network relay operations, and not on a per-exit-port basis, so I suspect as long as I keep my intra-Tor traffic running at 10, I get labeled as 10.  Correct ?
I am more interested in how often this is seen, if ever, and if it would be received badly.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor-exit running ntop 
First of all, your test is for servers that are answering on TCP 3000, which could very well be anything.  Perhaps ntop, perhaps nethack.  Who Second, ntop provides a subset of the information that anyone can trivially collect with tcpdump.
Any Tor user should assume that a baseline of traffic analysis and logging is being done on all relays - exit or not - and adjust your behavior

It's *possible* that rich, white citizens of global north countries will not be called to account for these actions in the future.
Not everyone will be so lucky.  So, while we autistically fixate on minute details of traffic analysis theory for Tor users, we should once in a while focus on rubber hoses.
Don't run Tor from an IP with your name attached to it.  This has nothing to do with technical feasibility, charitable intentions or terms of

Hello Gozu,
I disagree.  Once you move past the big "cloud" players, you get into a morass of small, cutthroat VPS providers who are all barely surviving on thin margins.  Without question you can find one that will respond very nicely to an "official" RFQ and a money order.  If you buy the MO from an actual bank, it will look very much like a cashiers check, etc. Alternatively, a pre-paid visa from somewhere like Simon malls, etc., works well.  The real hook is a single, annual payment, which will be impossible for them to resist.
That's one end of the spectrum...
The other end of the spectrum is a corporate front with an appointed agent, etc. - you can do this for less than $500, and then you can run everything under that.
Either way your name is not attached to it, and your home address, etc., isn't either.
The list may not appreciate my criticism, but the reality is we get about one post every six months from someone who literally has their door kicked in and their property stolen by the state.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Differences between real exit traffic and exit-generated 
Let's say I have an exit node handling average traffic and number of connections (whatever that is).  Let's also say that port 22 is included in my exit policy.
Now let's say that I, as the administrator, log onto the exit node and:
ssh user at host.com
I understand that a global observer with traffic analysis blah blah blah.
But what about someone just watching the exit node ?  Is there anything at all about my ssh connection generate from within the exit node that would distinguish it from "real" exiting Tor traffic ?

@_author: John Case 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Differences between real exit traffic and 
Hmmm... what I meant to say is, the Tor node exits port 22 *in addition to* the rest of its exit policy.  So, for example:
So someone watching all traffic in and out would see a whole lot of unknown incoming connections, all encrypted, from other tor nodes, and coming out of the node would see a whole bunch of traffic to all kinds of arbitrary destinations, over at least 6 different protocols.
How would they pick a single SSH outbound (low bandwidth, let's say an interactive shell login) and know that *that* one has no corresponding input ?
Ok, so there is a response speed fast enough that it *couldn't* have just done a three-hop back and forth ... that's interesting.
BTW, is this a FAQ ?  I can't be the first exit operator to be tempted by a low latency, "almost Tor" connection...

@_subject: [tor-talk] torsocks is broken and unmaintained 
There has to be a better way to simply "make an ssh connection over ToR".
I don't want to run all of tails just to make a single ssh connection (2 minutes to properly fire up vmware, massive cpu use, laptop gets hot, fans running, everything else comes to a crawl).
I don't want to run a full-blown tor relay installation with all the bells and whistles and then maintain that full blown environment, watch advisories, run periodic tests, test for dns leakage, blah blah.
I want this:
cd /usr/ports/net/torssh
make install
torssh user at host.com
Am I the only person that wants/needs this ?
I understand that you can't go down the road of "make a custom tor app for everry possible client app that people want to run", but come on ... ssh ? If there was just a single app to do this for, it would be that, right ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] some clarifications on hidden services ... 
I've read through /docs/hidden-services.html.en a few times over and I need some points clarified, if someone would be so kind ...
- Can I choose more than 3 random relays to announce my hidden service to ?  These are the "entry guards" that the doc refers to later, right ?
- If all of the random relays that I announce to initially go away, will I see that in logs/errors/messages, or be alerted in some way ?  I assume I'd need to reintroduce the service, but I could keep the same .onion address, right ?
- Other than losing my own keys, is there anything else that would force me to use a new .onion addre ?  Or can those stay persistent indefinitely - Can I move my hidden service around, physically, from network to network, and just reintroduce myself with each move ?  I assume this adds to my risks, since each reintroduction tells three more organizations the real IP of my hidden service, yes ?
Thanks you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can we come up with a lighter, 
My only use for tor is to set up plain old interactive ssh logins.
If I want to do this, I need to install the full blown tor package, and run tor (and quality assure it, sanity check my local installation, perform regular maintenance, etc.) just so I can run ssh with a netcat proxy command pointing back to my own tor instance blah blah blah.
Ok, fine.  I've done it for years.
But sometimes I just need to make a quick connection from a system that I don't have time, or authority, to do major package installation and run daemons, etc.  What I would really love is:
cd /usr/ports/net/torssh
make install ; rehash
torssh user at host.com
But this brings up a larger question ... are there ANY standalone end user applications that have tor built into them ?  or at least, enough of tor to simply connect and run connections over tor ?
So never mind that ssh is my particular need - think of any simple application:  fetch, wget, telnet, sftp, whatever ... it would really, really be nice if I could just fire off a 'fetch' command over tor without doing major software installation (and the associated QA, maintenance, research, etc.) with it.
Yes, I am aware of ancillary issues, like DNS leaks.  But if you're packaging up the particular application as "torssh" or "torfetch" then presumably you package it up without the leaks, which in my opinion is much safer than providing a general "torify" mechanism and hoping that people figure out the leak characteristics of their particular app - which is not easy, as evidenced by the little 'nc' table that is shown on the TorifyHOWTO wiki page ...
Comments ?  Has this ever been done with any particular app ?  Is there a fundamental flaw in wanting this ?

Tom, Andrew,
I'm a unix engineer and a coder, and even *I* sometime just don't feel up to constructing an entire proxy environment just to make an SSH connection over Tor.
And it's not just a case of setup time - there is assurance and testing and periodic fiddling with just to make sure you did it right, have it right and will continue to have it right.  And then you wake up at night and wonder if you really, really have the DNS leaking taken care of.
I know it's a big can of worms, since everyone has their favorite little binaries, but surely ssh is a good start :)
