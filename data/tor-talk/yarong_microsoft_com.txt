@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Onion Proxy Library 
I work on the Thali project [1] which depends on being able to?host hidden services on Android, Linux, Mac and Windows. We wrote an open source library to help us host a Tor OP that that we thought would be useful to the general community - The library produces an AAR (Android) and a JAR (Linux, Mac & Windows) that contain the Guardian/Tor Project's Onion Proxy binaries. The code handles running the binary, configuring it, managing it, starting a hidden service, etc.
The Tor_Onion_Proxy_Library started off with the Briar code for Android that Michael Rogers was kind enough to let us use [2]. We then expanded it to handle running on Linux, Mac and Windows. The code is just a wrapper around Briar's fork of jtorctl (originally from Guardian I believe) and the latest binaries from Guardian and the Tor Project.
This is an alpha release, version 0.0.0 so please treat accordingly.
I hope y'all find it useful.

I'm trying to understand section 1.10 of It seems to say that Alice and Bob directly negotiate a shared symmetric key. Is that true? Does it mean that all communications between Alice and Bob, in the context of a Tor hidden service, are in fact encrypted end to end?
I believe that  confirms this point when it says "The rendezvous point simply relays (end-to-end encrypted) messages from client to service and vice versa."
But this point is really critical for a threat model I'm building so I just want to make sure I've gotten things right. Could anyone confirm?

It does make sense actually. In my case the reason I care is because of the TLS cert hole.
As is well known (and in fact Tor itself has a work around for it) the TLS handshake puts the client and server certs in the clear. Tor works around this, I believe, with the renegotiation trick where it negotiates a connection just with the server cert and then does a renegotiation over the encrypted connection to get the client cert. That way only the server cert is in the clear, not the client cert.
But in the project I'm working on ( we want to protect the identities of both the client and the server. So we don't want the server's cert to be visible on the wire. To this end in our system peers (we are experimenting to see what it would take to build a peer to peer web) have two keys, a Tor hidden service key (e.g. onion address) and a separate identity key that is used to negotiate a SSL connection.
So a peer could have a constantly changing onion address while maintaining the same identity key. [1] So long as no one can see the TLS handshake then the connection between an onion address and the peer's identity key isn't easily discoverable.[2]
So Tor's end to end encryption for Tor hidden services is a real boon. It means when we negotiate the TLS mutual authentication connection over the Tor hidden service neither cert is ever in the clear and we get this for 'free'. That's really cool.
We are still in trouble for our ad-hoc networking and local networking cases (e.g. we have scenarios where users want to communicate directly without Tor) but those aren't as high priority and maybe we'll get lucky and the TLS 1.3 working group will fix the problem for us. If not, we have other work arounds (mostly using ephemeral certs with encrypted tokens in the SNI) but I'd rather not use them as they are fancy and hence unreliable.    But Tor hidden services is our primary use case and it looks like it just made our life even simpler. Which is great!
Tor, the gift that keeps on giving. :)

[1] We actually wanted to use the identity key as the Tor hidden service key, especially for 'email' like scenarios where someone wants to receive communications from people they haven't previously talked to. But since Tor hidden services don't currently include any kind of cert chaining we couldn't take this route for security reasons. I did see that the draft for the next version of the rendezvous protocol may contain 'cert chain like' capabilities in order to support keep keys offline which is great!
[2] Right now any client that finds out the onion address can of course just connect and see what key gets presented over TLS. In some cases (like the email one above) that is a feature. But in others it's a bug. I have looked at the authentication features supported via Tor hidden services and they actually would work pretty well for us. In most of our scenarios a peer wouldn't expect connections from more than a few hundred other peers. But right now I'm just trying to get the basics working before I get fancy.

Hi Yaron,
The short answer is yes. This is how Alice and Bob establish a shared
secret key.
The longer answer is yes, section 1.10 describes how Alice (the client)
and Bob (the hidden service) establish shared secrets. After both Alice
and Bob possess the two respective halves of the Diffie-Hellman keys,
they use the shared secret and a key derivation function to expand the
key material into a byte sequence from which a 5-tuple is extracted (KH,
Df, Db, Kf, Kb). The first element (KH) is used to prove knowledge of
the shared secret, the second (Df) is used when computing the digest of
every cell from Alice to Bob, Db is the same but for cells from Bob to
Alice, Kf is the shared secret key used to {en,de}cipher cells from
Alice to Bob, and Kb is used to {en,de}cipher cells from Bob to Alice.
It sounds like these latter two keys, Kf and Kb, are what you are most
interested in.  Assuming the rendezvous point is unable to break the
security assumptions of the Diffie-Hellman handshake and the KDF is
secure, all messages sent between Alice and Bob are end-to-end
Does this make sense?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Thali 
I want to introduce a project I'm working on called Thali. It is an open source (Apache 2 license) experiment to see what it would take to build a peer to peer web. You can find out a lot more at The core idea behind Thali is that users should be able to run their services on their devices, be that phones, tablets, PCs, etc. To enable that Thali provides a platform that consists of Embedded CouchDB + Public Keys as Identities authenticated over Mutual TLS Auth + Tor Hidden Services. We provide a platform over which many different kinds of apps could be run - blogging, micro-blogging, email, photo/file sharing, chat, calendaring, etc. Right now the first app we are experimenting with is called PPNET, an EU funded open source project to create a social network in a box. We are adapting it to run over the Thali platform. Our hope is that if Thali is successful then other people will write Apps on top of our platform.
Our code is primarily written in Java and runs on Android and in the JVM on the desktop. We currently have, thanks to Couchbase Lite, an embedded CouchDB server and we support generating keys, certs, etc. and using them peer to peer over mutual SSL/TLS auth. I'm now working on adding in Tor Hidden Services support. My plan is to try and make hidden services work on Android using the Guardian code and to use the mainline Tor code for the desktop.
And, of course, we can always use contributors if anyone is interested! :)
        Thanks!

I just updated the Tor Onion Proxy Library [1]. The library will set up a Tor Onion Proxy and help you connect to it as well as use it to host a hidden service. It provides an AAR for Android and a JAR for Linux, OS/X and Windows.
The updates are:
    Re-wrote the readme to provide some sample code
    Changed build process to simplify it
    Updated binaries for Android, Linux, OS/X and Windows to Tor 2.5.10
    Updated Android project to work with SDK 21
    Updated Android binary to use PIE so it will work on Lollipop

Hopefully the code looks pretty familiar since it all came from Orbot and Briar in the first place. You may also want to look at our backlog. I haven't managed to convince Pivotal Tracker to give me a direct link so to see the backlog:
1. Navigate to 2. On the left hand side of the screen click on 'Epics'
3. The first epic is "Tor Onion Proxy Library" with a right facing arrow on the right side. Click on that.
Now you can see our backlog.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Cryptopolitik and the Darknet 
Personally I view Tor as enabling the fundamental vision of the Internet, what is sometimes called the end to end principle, but now, with added anonymity.
The end to end principle argues that end nodes can directly connect without requiring the help of an intermediary. Unfortunately, this principle is a dead letter on the Internet today and nobody ever seems to notice. Just look at the arguments about net neutrality. They are all about the right to listen, not the right to be heard. That is, the right to connect to any service one wants on equal terms but not the right to run one's own service and be heard on one's own terms. As such we only allow people to be heard if they are mediated by someone else. For example, my mobile phone has more than enough CPU and battery to run basic services on my behalf but when I'm on a cell connection or at work or in a caf? I can't be heard. I'm forced to be behind a NAT, firewall or both and so cut off. Sure, I can listen to whomever I want, but I can't be heard.
Tor, along with anonymity, has the ability to start the long and hard process of redressing this imbalance. To not just provide the right to listen anonymously (i.e. via an onion connection) but also the right to be heard anonymously (i.e. via a hidden service).
Tor has argued that we have the right to listen without being forced to expose our identity. Don't we also have the right to be heard without being forced to expose our identity? It would be awful if just as people's personal devices are powerful to give them a voice, Tor takes away the infrastructure needed to make that voice audible.

As an erstwhile bridge operator & also one who's put a lot of thought into the possibilities of abuse of the network, and also never quite believing that "there are more good than bad people," I found the article extremely useful.  Two passages from the summary:
"Proponents of hidden services argue that the cryptographic protocols that power the internet today were at the fringe of software development and considered a threat as late as 1995. Hidden services, they argue, are what https was 20 years prior: the future of security, not a threat to security. These arguments are strong, and cannot be dismissed; the technology may well mature and move into the mainstream in the future. But the crypto purists, Tor's developers among them, often fail to acknowledge an even more fundamental point, one that is deeply rooted in the recent history of cryptography: enhanced privacy, enhanced authentication and enhanced user anonymity are not tied to the service or content provider remaining anonymous and unregistered. Our first four properties ? security, authentication, user anonymity and cash (or blockchains) ? are entirely disconnected from the fifth: unidentified hidden exchanges. These issues are conceptually, politically and technically distinct. "
"End-to-end encryption will therefore always be available to a determined, capable user. Moreover, at present, the powerful dynamics of open markets for communication services do not favour end-to-end encryption among individuals at a large scale, thus limiting the technology's wider appeal and uptake. Any attempt to systematically undermine end-to-end encryption ? through legislation requiring service providers to retain the option of removing encryption for any given user ? will likely strengthen more secure implementations by creating more demand for them, and thus help criminals and militants. We believe it should be a political no-go area for democratically elected governments to pursue such a path."
So if it's possible to retain the desirable aspects of onion services while also abandoning unidentifiability of content providers, why not do it?  Tor operators and users could then join the rest a progressive society, no?
I hope everyone takes time to read the article.  Then it would be interesting to take a poll or vote here to see how the Tor community feels about this. - eliaz
