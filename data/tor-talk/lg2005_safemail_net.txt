@_subject: Tor/Vidalia sponsorship 
I am not able to modify the Vidalia source, so I am looking somebody to implement new features on Vidalia. The new version would be available to everybody of course, maybe under another name if there is a copyright issue on the name "Vidalia".
For this I will of course pay, as I want something made "quickly".
Please contact me by email if you are interested - and able to do such work.
Thank you

@_subject: Tor circuits entry node 
I noticed since a few days that quite all the circuits that are made by my TOR/Vidalia, have the same entry points: Either Piktor either Praesepe. That looks strange... Even after a command "New identity", most of the times I get those 2 entry nodes.
Also, from time to time Vidalia uses 80% of the CPU resource... Had to shut it down a few times.
Vidalia 0.0.16
Tor 0.2.0.12 alpha r12518

@_subject: About bridges 
I tried to setup a bridge on my home box, no problem, BUT I was surprised to see (in Vidalia) a circuit with my bridge as exitnode! The circuit was something like "node_1,node_2,$123456789ABCDEF"
$123456789ABCDEF was the ID of my bridge as shown in the Vidalia config panel.
In the right side of the Vidalia interface, there was information about node_1 and node_2 but nothing about $123456789ABCDEF.
So my question is: A bridge can be an exitnode? That looks strange for me! Is there any way to run a bridge that is NOT an exitnode?
Thank you

@_subject: Tor: 100% CPU 
I already saw some messages about this but cannot find them back.
Tor 0.2.0.15-alpha when I launch it uses 100% CPU. I have to shut it down through CTRL-ALT-DEL, launch it again and the second time it is ok.
This wasn't before, I think it began to happen 2 or 3 beta releases ago.
Will this be fixed?
(+Vidalia on Win-XP)
Thanks, and best wishes for 2008 :)

Thanks, yes in fact I had to install openssl too :)
Ok tor is running now, but where is the config file?
"[notice] Configuration file "/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc" not present, using reasonable defaults."
I want check and probably change some of the reasonable defaults!

@_subject: Questions about a TOR server 
So finally I am running "research36" :) To begin I decided to not be an exit mode, but will change this soon.
Which policy must I put in the log file if I want to be an "exit node" but ONLY on the port 443? Yes, I don't want to allow the port 80, non-encrypted...
Other question: What can I do to see the traffic of the Tor server? I don't know a lot about unix systems.
Thank you!

In the Vidalia log file:

How is it possible?

I noticed that if I let some lines "commented" (with a  they are always removed when I launch Vidalia (and Tor is launched by Vidalia), and that the old copy of torrc is archived.
Is there a way to KEEP these commented lines in the torrc file?
Thank you

@_subject: Tor Password?? 
I just upgraded to 0.2.0.20-rc from 0.2.0.19-alfa
Seems there is a bug, I am always asked to enter a password, even when I check the "randomly generate" password setting in Vidalia.
Moreover, if I enter a password manually instead of ticking "randomly generate", this password is never accepted in when I am asked to enter it. So tor never runs... For it runs, I have to chose the "Cookie" option.

Every minute there is a log message:
[Notice] We're missing a certificate from authority lefkada with signing key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000: launching request.
I put lefkada in my excludenode list, no change. Nobody can remove this node from the list of nodes?

@_subject: 100% CPU - again 
When I launch Tor and then a few times later whn Tor is running, Tor uses 100% CPU. I found some tickets in Vidalia about this. Why isn't it possible to fix this problem, as it didn't happen in earlier releases of Tor/Vidalia? Every time it happens, the computer is just unable to do anything during a few minutes!

@_subject: Warning messages 
I noticed this message in the Vidalia log window:
"[Warning] Application request to port 110: this port is commonly used for unencrypted protocols. Please make sure you don't send anything you would mind the rest of the Internet reading!"
This is great, but as I check various addresses on the port 110 every 5 minutes or so, my log window is full of this. Is there a way to stop the program sending THIS warning?
(I know that port 110 is NOT encrypted, but don't care for these addresses)

@_subject: 100% CPU - again 
Sorry to come back with this problem, but where does it come from? The older releases of Tor/Vidalia didn't use 100% CPU during  afew minutes, so (sorry to ask so directly!) why isn't it fixed in the last release?

@_subject: About the MapAddress option 
I connect to servers through SSH on port 22 with Tor: The SSH client  connects to localhost:9050 and privoxy does the job with Tor.
I connect to the server IP, like 1.2.3.4
Is there a way to select an exit node so that all connections to the 1.2.3.4, or even better to 1.2.3.4:22 use this exit node? As the MapAddress for http?
Thank you

@_subject: Another MapAddress option 
I noticed that when I use MapAddress for one domain in the TOR config, all requests that are done in the same time to other domains also use the special circuit with "exitnode" at the end.
Is it normal? Is there a way so that the special circuit will be used ONLY to connect to the site specified in MapAddress?
Thank you

@_subject: "unnamed" exit nodes 
Using tor/vidalia, how can I know the ID number of a tor node? I want to put some "unnamed" in my black list, but as a few nodes have the same name, it looks hard.
What happens if I put just "unnamed" in the blacklist? Will ALL servers with this "name" banned?
Thank you

@_subject: Server names 
A suggestion for TOR servers parameters in Vidalia: PROHIBE The "unnamed" servers by requesting a name, ANY name! It is impossible to set these servers in any option without finding their keyname, and it requests to open the log files, etc etc. BTW if the server keyname would be listed in the Vidalia window where the server location, IP etc are, that would be very great. Hard to do?! :)
