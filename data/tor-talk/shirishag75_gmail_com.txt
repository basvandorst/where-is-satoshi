@_subject: [tor-talk] Videos and subtitles of talks on tor and more info. at 
Hi all,
Newbie to tor. Using it for strictly educational purposes for self as
well as to share with others who might be interested in it.
The first thing I want to ask is about the various videos about tor
and if there are english subtitles available for them ?
Specifically  - I tried to
search in but came up empty.
( at I haven't downloaded either because didn't see either an .srt or any
mention of subtitles in either of the video description
I used the debian tor package and took sometime to understand where it
starts from (the browser)
$ alias tor
alias tor='/home/shirish/.local/share/torbrowser/tbb/x86_64/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser'
Alternatively, if I launch torbrowser-launcher checks the gpg keys of
Erinn Clark I get the following :-
$ torbrowser-launcher

As haven't got a mirrors.txt and also don't know a good resource,
there is just a settings file therein.
~/.config/torbrowser$ ls
Is mirrors.txt a necessity? If yes, then looking for documentation about it.
Lastly, it seems the default logging of tor browser sessions is only
at WARN. Is there a way to introduce/have more idea in the log ?

As has been shared in the manpages or somewhere else, it is possible
to change the verboseness but dunno how .
Looking forward to know more.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Your Firefox is out of date" 
at bottom :-
Dear Georg,
I tried and did as shared above, i.e. going ot about:config and
changing the value from the URL. I even tried updating the addons in
order to make the "Your Firefox is out of date" disappear but no
I looked at the bug-report and tried the second option shared therein -
A solution --
Go to about:config/extensions.bootstrappedAddon
Reset the string Value to empty Value {}
Restart Tor browser.
The warning will not appear again.
That worked.

It did but it also took away all my extensions :( . I didn't backup
the extensions.bootstrappedAddon
Any idea what to do now other than downloading 6.0.3 and doing
everything from scratch :(

Hi Georg,
I should have been more clear. What has happened is while I  can see
the addons in Tools > Addons , near the URL bar where there are icons,
that space doesn't have much.  I have the URI locator, search-engine
and then the drop-down menu thing which has things like Cut, Copy,
Is there a way to take backup of all the extensions (and data in
extensions) and passwords and bookmarks ?
This is where my tor browser lies
─[$] alias tor
I would like to have minimum fuss happening. I'm ok with downloading
the browser again.
I am using the english languagepack so that shouldn't be any different, right .

@_subject: [tor-talk] using same usernames on same websites under tor and 
Hi all,
Most sites more or less use https:// by default nowadays. However, it
has been suggested by quite a few people that you do not use the same
usernames when using tor.
While for new sites it certainly makes sense, for sites which you have
been using (like mail) and say forums or wherever reputation is
important, it makes sense to use the same identity.  Also in some
sites it is illegal to have more than one username from the same mail
address. So you have to make a new identity altogether which is
painstaking and takes time.
Could somebody comment as it relates to both privacy and identity at
the same time.

at bottom :-
A little backgrounder here so it makes more sense. As today is India's
Independence Day, I took the opportunity to share how people could get
on tor, see
 Although the best would be to use Tails but for people who use a
regular distribution like Debian, it should help a bit.
I didn't actually know what advice I should give them and as can be
seen I just gave a one-liner to say people should have new identities.
Although I myself haven't had to make that choice as frankly I'm not
in a situation that I need to fear for my life where association could
make put your life in danger.
I do however, understand the importance that more people being on tor
would help, so it is a small step in that regard. I also do understand
the importance of bridges and relays but then the blog post became a
bit too long and would have been a classic case of information
I also did try the videos at
 and especially
videos of Georg Koppen and Philipp Winter but didn't get them as the
accent threw me off :( .
I tried the youtube subs but they weren't any better as well but that
is probably a different thing altogether.

@_subject: [tor-talk] does it make sense to change channels from alpha to beta 
Dear all,
I was looking at How to install 64-bit Tor Browser on Windows 10 .
I went to  and
downloaded the alpha build which was released with 64-bit richness
there i.e. 7.5.a9
I then went into C:\Users\generation2\Desktop\Tor
Browser\Browser\defaults\pref\channel-prefs after closing down the
browser where I changed from alpha to beta channel.
Now does it make sense to do that change as I haven't seen beta
releases at least on
I even went to the github mirror to see if more than one branch was
active only to see that it just says master/head which probably are
updates to the alpha build.
I do know that tbb is a derivative of the mozilla Firefox product and
can be seen there are number of channels and releases that one can run
I am somewhat confused as I couldn't find any info. about it either in
documentation or in the wiki as to how things happen.
Any hint/guide/tip would be welcome.

Dear all,
I looked at  and it seems like a
decent monitor to find the state of the tor network. I am wondering
why isn't there a monitor for MS-Windows as well ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] unable to start tbb after a tor update on debian. 
Dear all,
I am using debian buster. I used to start tor from an alias
I updated tbb as it was out of date and after update couldn't start it.
It seems that the path has been changed to -
Trying to run that either as an alias or via console I get the following -
┌─[shirish at debian] -
[~/.local/share/torbrowser/tbb/x86_64/tor-browser_en-US] - [10018]
└─[$] ./start-tor-browser.desktop

./Browser/execdesktop: line 14: ./Browser/start-tor-browser: No such
file or directory
Can somebody help in diatonising the problem and perhaps offer some solutions.
