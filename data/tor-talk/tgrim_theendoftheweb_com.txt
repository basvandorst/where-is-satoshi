Hi! I just switched to Linux (debian) and installed tor, but when I run
it I get the following messages:
Jun 30 00:10:52.466 [notice] tor_init(): Tor v0.0.9.10. This is
experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Jun 30 00:10:52.467 [warn] /var/lib/tor is not owned by this UID (1000).
You must fix this to proceed.
Jun 30 00:10:52.467 [err] options_act(): Couldn't access/create private
data directory /var/lib/tor
Jun 30 00:10:52.467 [err] init_from_config(): Acting on config options
left us in a broken state. Dying.
  Is there an easy way to fix this?
