The only way I've been able to create a Gmail account recently was through an Android tablet. I installed Orbot and Orweb APKs so all traffic was through Tor at the time, then created the account through Settings > Acounts & Sync > Add Account. I was surprised it didn't want a phone number.
I've created accounts with hushmail but they block some exit nodes.
I saw  mentioned  before and I can confirm that they don't reject Tor users. I use these guys the most. I've read some suspicions about them, though, because their NS is through barak.net.il but I don't know if that's a valid concern.

In my country it's difficult (but not impossible!) to obtain "throw
away" SIM cards due to industry regulations that require telcos and
retailers to obtain proof of ID at the point of sale and registration
of SIM cards. AFAIK,  this proof of ID and the SIM card information is
registered with a government agency.
That's a valid concern. It's important for people to remember that,
although a Google/GMail account might not be used for personal email,
once it's associated to a personal Android device you've lost your
privacy/anonymity on that device.

I don't know if an APK exists outside Google Play, and if it did, how
trustworthy that source would be. I can offer two alternatives though:
build the APKs for yourself, or obtain the APKs from someone who has
the latest from Google Play.

I asked in irc.freenode.net  and was linked to
 . From
the Tor Project git repo ( the
latest version appears to be 0.2.3.17-beta-1.0.9-rc5a, which is also
the version available on Google Play, but the latest "FINAL" version
appears to be 0.2.3.11-alpha-1.0.7.2-OBFS-FINAL. With different
versions from different "official" locations, which is the best place
to get Orbot?

It really doesn't remove confusion. How often does a user scroll to
the very bottom of a webpage? The text will rarely be seen by those
who should be reading it.
I think your links to the Tor Project website at the bottom of the
TorBrowser home page ("What Tor does", "Users of Tor", "Installation
Guides", ...) are probably there with best intentions, but I can see
this facilitating the confusion because users don't see a distinction
between the legitimate Tor Project website and the TorBrowser website.
It would incorrectly legitimise the TorBrowser website.
I'm curious - for what reason(s) was the TorBrowser started? If the
leaks mentioned earlier were known with Dooble, why was it chosen for
the project? People use Tor to protect themselves; it would seem that
the choice to use Dooble didn't have users best interests in mind.
I did a brief check but didn't determine the answer - is perrymikey

The conversation has landed on cryptome.org and hackerne.ws . The last comment at cryptome.org is interesting for the discussion.
