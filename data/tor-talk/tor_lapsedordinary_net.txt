They don't have "a complete list", but they have many of such vulnerabilities, we can be certain of that.
It is also likely that they have vulnerabilities in any other operating system. And in Tor implementations. And it is good to assume they have enough 'crackers' on staff that will be able to exploit such Depending on why someone uses Tor, this may or may not be an issue. If you use Tor to do research into cybercrime, or to access your organisation's mail server while on a secret mission, it may not matter very much.
In other cases it may be a reason not to use the Internet at all. Or to make an informed choice about how you can use Tor while minimising the attack vector.

I believe it's fairly common - and definitely not new. Botnets using Tor for C&C-communication isn't new either.
But I suspect that either a new botnet, or one that's recently been updated, is using Tor at a far larger scale than previously seen.

That depends on what the botnet is doing.
If it were using Tor to connect to some service on the public Internet, either for C&C communication, or to do something via Tor (like using Tor to leave comment spam), it would sooner or later end up in honeypots. I'm pretty sure it would have been discovered by now.
But Tor could also be used for communication with a control server on a hidden service, which would be a lot harder to detect by honeypots. Botnets have used this before - it could be that nodes in an existing botnet are gradually being updated to a newer version that uses Tor. It could also be a completely new botnet, that is infecting machines at a fairly high rate.
Another possibility is a botnet, or perhaps just a piece of software, that is broken and thus causing a lot of unintended Tor traffic.
Or, as has been suggested, it could be a DDoS attack. Perhaps a DDoS attack on Tor as a whole, or perhaps a DDoS attack on a single (hidden) service, that, given how Tor works, seriously disrupts the whole network.

I don't know. But can they detect a Tor user (or bot) in Brazil connecting to a hidden service running on a server in Sweden? For that's what would matter here.
Measuring botnets is far from trivial - but this would be huge.
I meant to say that this could be a DDoS attack aimed at one particular hidden service. DDoS'ing a competitor/enemy isn't uncommon, especially in the darker corners of the Net. It's just that, if I'm not mistaken, you can't really DDoS a single hidden service without seriously disturbing the whole Tor network.
