@_subject: Using TOR? get lost! 
Not long ago i've got interesting reply from one of the IRC servers:
--- You (* are banned from this server: Tor proxy detected.
--- Closing Link: ********[id at 207.44.180.3] (K-lined: Tor proxy detected.)
So, it means that server denies connection because the client is using
1. Did anyone from community experienced such, eh, "discrimination"?
2. How they realised that connection torified? blacklisted ip?
modified tor client that keep track of running nodes? or something
3. Though the people running server is in their rights to refuse any
connection (as mentioned in their disclaimer), to what consequences
may lead widespreading of such policies? If owners of the popular
services will refuse torified users, how one can get anonymity?

@_subject: client problem on slow connection 
I'm expiriencing next problem using tor version 0.1.0.17 via slow GPRS
connection (though it is slow, speed is enough for IRC and ICQ for
ex.): when client is receiving directory from directory server,
connection housekeeping engine kills connection:
Mar 24 14:25:01.625 [debug] conn_read_callback(): socket 1664 wants to read.
Mar 24 14:25:01.625 [debug] read_to_buf_impl(): Read 1460 bytes. 259880 on inbuf.
Mar 24 14:25:01.625 [debug] connection_dir_process_inbuf(): Got data, not eof. Leaving on inbuf.
Mar 24 14:25:01.796 [info] run_connection_housekeeping(): Expiring wedged directory conn (fd 1664, p
urpose 1)
Mar 24 14:25:01.796 [info] conn_close_if_marked(): Cleaning up connection (fd 1664).
Mar 24 14:25:01.796 [info] connection_remove(): removing socket 1664 (type Dir), nfds now 1
Mar 24 14:25:01.796 [info] _connection_free(): closing fd 1664.
As i dig into the source, i've found that there's DIR_CONN_MAX_STALL
constant (coded as  which is 5*60 seconds. (110 line of
src/or/main.c revision 1.638). So when 5 minutes are gone, connection
is killed.
Possibly solutions:
1. Increase time directly fixing main.c (straight, but dumb way)
2. Read constant from torrc (more work, but completely solves this

I'd switch to 0.1.1.16-rc and described problem disappeared, but
working circuit wasn't established, in spite of long waiting. I need
to analyze log file attentively to find reason and for further
discussion. I'll inform about results of investigation.
Thanks for your time
