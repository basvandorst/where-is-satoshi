hi list
after running a relay for about a month, donating fairly limited bandwidth to the cause, i have written an entry on this blog  yes, another blog about running a tor relay, the reason for running a relay was to gain an insight into what tor is being used for, which is pretty hard going considering the tor design, in order to make an informed decision regarding the morality of supporting such a system.
another reason is to provide a list of POP accounts (pop server IP and username, no password is captured) being accessed via tor, just in case any admins/users of these servers/accounts find it odd that they are being accessed over tor.
is there a case for maintaining a central repository of ip/username pairs from certain protocols (pop3, imap, ftp, whatever) emanating from exit nodes as a reference for admins in the case that access via tor to these accounts is prohibited/not advised.
i hope this won't be seen to be against the spirit of supporting such a project; I just find tor and its uses quite intriguing. i'll happily withdraw this support if the majority believe this to be detrimental to the project.
peace out

Nope, but I'm sure there is something similar where I am.
If I believe that the majority of POP3 traffic over tor is performed by unauthorised parties, and as an exit node admin I'm someway helping this access, then is there not a moral argument for exit node admins to detect the abuse of tor and alert the people affected? to go further, is there not a moral argument for this detection/alerting to be done by tor itself?  in POP3's case the mail server administrator/security people might benefit from a resource that would tell them whether any of their assets are being abused using tor. as long as only specific identifiers are captured, with absolutely no personal details, I'd think a repository of this kind would help out a few people, and I don't see the
harm in doing so.
I'd be interested if people did see the harm.
Again, if this is detrimental to the project I'll stop the relay.

a guess really.
based on one assumption:
  - pop3 access from government and/or private companies will never be routed through tor
i believe this to be a fair assumption.
agreed, having had time to look around all the resources people have created for this community, every exit node or tor itself capturing specific identifiers just isn't a good idea.
could protocols supporting en clair passwords be denied, a la smtp?
is is possible to run a relay on tcp/25?
how about tcp/21?
isn't tor an interesting beast!

is publishing the mail server IP address and username 'outing' user data?
would just the mail server IP address be better?
i just believe ,at least i think I do - running the relay was a chance for me to determine the morality for myself, that to participate in a system such as tor, whose purpose is so specific, and not to think and raise questions about what maintaining a relay means and the possibilities for helping the victims of these potential abuses, seem at the moment to not be fulfilling a basic obligation to your fellow man.
of course not all tor traffic is miscreant in nature and I recognise strongly the need for freedom of speech.

there really is no need for that.
i was simply expressing my opinion.
the blog and relay have been removed and i've tried to explain my views as best i can.
i suggest this is the end of it.
