@_subject: Selecting and using a particular Tor IP address 
I find that when I'm browsing on forum that require a
login, whenever I decide to post I have to keep
re-logging in because the Tor IP keeps rotating on me
while I'm on a forum session.  After viewing some of
the IP's from the Tor network I can see that several
IP's have uptime of several months.  I'm wondering,
can you manually request to be connected to one these
high uptime IP's in order to avoid the Tor network
constantly changing IP's all of the time?  I'd like to
stick to one IP if possible during a forum
participation session.  Thanks!

Thanks for the tip.  I'm a bit new to this, so please
forgive the dumb question, but where do you find the
nodename?  Is this the IP address?
Additionally, if I wanted to manually set my
connection server setting to an http proxy IP # and
correspnding port # from someone that is running on
the Tor network, now would I go about doing this?  I
know I can find the IP address through the Tor network
map, but am curious how to find the corresponding
