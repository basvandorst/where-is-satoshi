the hammer analogy is perfectly apt imho. you normally would use a hammer to bash nails in to wood to build a wide variety of things, but you could also use a hammer to break a lock or kill someone or smash a window. in terms of the virtual world, you can use an internet access system (whether direct or proxied) to do things on the internet, and you can use them to do bad things the problem is not the tool, the problem is the user. considering the degree of privacy violation being perpetrated by malicious entities on the internet (advertisers, script kiddies, identity thieves, phishers) there really does need to be measures to counteract this invasion of privacy. it is not going to stop cybercrime to outlaw one anonymising system, but it is going to damage the rights of good people to outlaw an accessible anonymising system.
weigh up the costs and benefits and if your goal is to stop malicious internet use you are barely even going to knock a chip out of the side of it by banning tor. tor is not exactly invulnerable to tracing, for one thing, there is only maybe at most 10000 clients on the internet and 300 nodes. while it makes it harder, it certainly isn't impossible for an internet infrastructure system administration to at least establish who on their networks are using it. this could then enable them to start up traffic analysis scanning to figure out who amongst the tor users is looping back into the network. the onus of security maintenance, will always lie on the operators of the services. it is facile, for example, to set up blocking of tor to services which should not be used anonymously anyway, such as internal authentication systems and email services, but permit tor use anyone who thinks that banning tor will achieve anything in the war against malicious use of the internet has no imagination or capacity for logic in my humble opinion. taking a black and white view of tor use will only harm other tor users whose intentions and actions warrant no such treatment.

i really like that idea. there's plenty of specifications around the place about how to set up secure electronic cash systems based on asymmetric cryptography. if tor were to integrate it into its infrastructure, this would mitigate the cost side of the node running business, and it would definitely increase the implementation of tor nodes. if your packets have tor-cash attached to them, they are put in the top bucket, if they are not, they go in the low priority bucket. people will learn pretty fast.
or how about don't bother with the electronic cash thing, make a protocol which signifies that the packet originated from a tor server and have these packets prioritised. then the p2p folks will be more likely to set up nodes (being that they mostly have bulk bandwidth, they are a good target) will set up more nodes because of the advantage of the bandwidth being more available to them if they run a node.

by adding a protocol to signify persisting connections (so that while a circuit operates it is recognised as such) and a single signature check at the beginning of the circuit establishment. sure it will add *some* load to the server's cpu but the verification only has to be done once every 15 minutes per user at the most.

i see the problem, the conundrum is to enable identification of server originated traffic without creating identity-revealing data.
Perhaps the nym server thing is exactly the solution that is required, blind signed keys which do nothing more than certify that the recipient of the signature is known to be a server.

i just added this to the gentoo wiki:
and i wanted to post the info in the gentoo forum where the same type of info was also posted, but in your infinite wisdom you have chosen to block access to the forum on the basis of my network origin, even though out of all tor users trolls are only a minority, just as they are anywhere else.
why should i have to give away my identity to contribute to your forum??? the admins of the gentoo wiki haven't been so stupid as to block tor users. couldn't you just set up registered user only posting for the forums rather than block network nodes on an open proxy system? if you are gonna block tor, are you gonna add all other open proxy addresses too? are you gonna choose to make it difficult to access the forum anonymously? tor is the easiest form of anonymising available. it is gonna be used mainly by people for whom malicious behavior is not something they wish to do, people who don't want to have to be messing around with more complex and difficult to run anonymising systems, who just want to be anonymous.
blocking tor users on the basis of a small number of trolls is completely unfair, what makes you think that just cos a few lazy script kiddies want to make asses of themselves through tor that everyone who uses tor is automatically a troll?

i was going to make a post in exactly the vein of this one - privoxy is still needed. I have become very used to not ever seeing ads  and knowing that advertising is gaining absolutely zero information from their advertising, and webservers are getting nothing potentially identifying from the http headers.
My only gripe at this point with all of this is the DNS issue. Could it not be resolved permanently by adding a dns proxy into tor so that if a program does not use the proxied resolve it is diverted through tor anyway? If this were done there would be no more issues with the completeness of the defense against traffic analysis.
I have given up using firefox in disgust in part because of compilation issues and stability and memory consumption and security problems in favour of opera, and i am reticent about switching back because the combination of a hierarchic notepad, email client, irc client and the neat (could be better but is the best i've used) configurable paned interface is extremely hard to beat. (i could ask for more but being that i'm an imcompetent coder, at this point there is little i can really do about it)

have you tried running ldd on the built binaries to see where they are i'd say that they are looking first in a place where an old version is already installed. maybe you built the old version previously in an overlaying library search path.
This is a problem that you never encounter when you just install them directly to the root. Unless you are producing a binary distribution package you should never need to do this - and even if you are, most methods of doing this (apart from slack, which is simple tar archives) have means of pulling a package together from its live installed location... well, gentoo does anyway (qpkg) i have a few gripes with gentoo's ways but by and large it is better than anything else out there for ease of software management.

@_subject: questions about hidden service hashes, and experiences running hidden services 
i've been using and running tor for quite a few months now and i have finally got myself in a position to be able to run a tor server properly (thanks to the donation of an old celeron 566 box) and i have been messing around with running servers which are only accessible from the hidden regarding the topic of securing apache for this purpose, the out-of-the-box configuration sets up of apache has to be changed so it doesn't glom to all addresses, this was fairly easy. i'm running gentoo, and i set up a self-signed certificate which has only got the hidden service address as contents - it may seem silly to run a web server on ssl *as well* as on tor, but hey, you can't beat 4-5 layers of encryption from 4-5 different key pairs :D. i had to set apache, in httpd.conf to listen to 127.0.0.1:80, disabled the default vhost (which i also set to listen on the same address/port just to be sure) enabled ssl and the default ssl vhost and set them both to listen on 127.0.0.1:443.  is where you will find the server, i wouldn't mind if anyone interested would mess around with it to see if it can be made to leak any sensitive info, most importantly the external internet ip address the server is on. (to save any annoyance clicking 'ok' on accept untrusted ssl keys, the public key of the signing CA (the same key as the public key in this case) is available at  which will enable your browser to 'trust' my ssl enabled server)
now, to the question which concerns me. I read in the tor spec that the hidden service address is an SHA1 hash of the server public key. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this (but i seriously doubt it) - SHA1 is now no longer secure. If the public key were equal or shorter than the length of the hash, this would mean that the hidden service .onion address could be cracked and the public key discovered, and the public key would then be able to be searched in the directory and the ip address revealed. I apologise if this is a question that has already been covered, my reading of the specs was not deep although i looked some ways, i couldn't discern whether the possibility of inverting the hash and identifying the IP through the directory was a possibility, so i thought i'd ask the list and see if anyone can answer this question. I realise that if the data used to generate a hash with an insecure function is longer than the hash produced that there is no issue. I just want to be sure about the security of the hidden services before i go announcing the address any further than here without knowing if giving this address is going to compromise my IP address - cos that would defeat the purpose of doing it at all.
ignore my question if it is stupid. looking at the fingerprint of the server i can see that it is 20 bytes. the hash is 20 bytes. i was not sure until i looked and counted but if i am not mistaken, decoding the hidden address to bytes, and running an SHA1 cracking program on it should yield the server fingerprint. i would like to be told that this is not possible but the numbers all look right to me.

@_subject: questions about hidden service hashes, and experiences running hidden servic 
ah yes, i realised this after posting this question...
connecting hidden services to tor servers is definitely verboten... i realised this straight away, what's the point of being able to hide where you are serving from if you then proceed to reveal it???
they aren't listed anywhere...
i'm glad to hear all these vague concerns dealt with. incidentally being able to generate the same hash from different data is not really a security issue, nor is it particularly onerous, except perhaps in the case of the unlikely event of collisions of hidden service hashes and with file hashes.
but the fact that collisions can occur should be a motivating reason behind finding a more hardened hash function to use. while there is no major issues right now, tor is unlikely to stop growing in node count, the more nodes, the proportionally greater chance of hash collisions. perhaps, at the very least, some kind of checking algorithm could be implemented to ensure that a generated hidden service public key does not collide with any other existent and online server would be a good idea.
kudos to the tor dev folks, tor rules! who needs freenet when when you can use tor? imo, redundancy should be the responsibility of the host, not the Don't just search. Find. Check out the new MSN Search!

i run my tor server from a connection which only has 32k/s upstream bandwidth, and the minimum speed demanded of tor servers makes quite a load on my connection. it is my opinion that there should be the option to run a tor node as slow as 10k/s, and this was possible until recent versions. the bandwidth problem will be solved if all tor clients are obliged to run nodes at a minimum of 10k/s imo. fair enough dialup users should not have to contribute anything but anyone with dsl can do 10k/s comfortably.

@_subject: SSL fro hidden services 
i am considering running an onion-based CA which could be used... i simply need to make a script which allows a user to sign a certificate signing request and produce a signed server key. the server key only needs to have its onion address as content, nothing more is required, and a link to import the CA key into the browser so that it can be trusted automatically by the yes, this is the case, and it is a valid reason to use ssl. in my opinion, since tor already uses multi-layered encryption anyway, one more layer at the core is not going to create that much of an extra load on the server, and it means that there is no way the traffic can be sniffed at any point - for example a trojan could sniff localhost traffic. also, using onion routing defeats the one way in which SSL can be attacked, by man-in-the-middle intermediaries on the network pathway, which of course cannot be known within the tor network. Also, it should be noted that tor exit nodes could potentially be modified to become men-in-the-middle, although this would not be possible without compromising the key of the server being contacted - another aspect of the advantage of using tor.
onion addresses are impossible to remember though - which brings me to another idea - of a name resolution system within the tor network so simpler names can be used. this would require a second directory system, i don't know if it is practical or not, but i thought i should put the idea out there because i2p has name resolution systems, and benig able to type in oniondomainname.onion rather than u15syoa125au.onion would be nice. it would increase the rate of take-up of hidden services, both use and hosting.
onion domains could be propagated throughout the onion network, so that every tor node can translate a name into an onion hashed address. there would also need to be a system to prevent name spoofing... how to ensure there is no collisions of names would be tricky - very likely it would require a set of authoritative name servers similar to how there is authoritative onion directory servers.
ah dammit, i am always ideas ideas ideas and so little action... prioritising goals is something i find difficult... i think i should make this idea a priority, however, which means joining the dev effort and, at the very least, defining a protocol, if not implementing code... well, anyway, i have put the idea out now. i think that the idea is a good one. tor is coming of age now and ideally tor should aim to provide all of the features one would expect in an internet layer, but with the guiding principle of protecting anonymity always ascendant. an onion-based CA would work much better if the name-resolution system were in place, so i think it should be the priority.

if you use tor to access hotmail, won't this affect what exact location in the hotmail network you connect? sounds like just another reason to have tor/privoxy on a usb key, most internet cafes let you use them and since no installation is required, usually there will be no issues with running the programs. i don't access the internet on the move, but if i were to need to regularly i definitely would be sorting out this issue - using tor consistently to access services is essential, otherwise your location will be revealed in their server logs.

of course, a search engine! names are nonsense anyway, mnemonics... names could be implemented in a browser extension, in fact they already are implemented, just not in a simple way.
as someone else pointed out somewhere... hmm i can't remember exactly, some article about icann, domain names constitute a 'resource' which tends to mean that people compete for it and thus end up being dished out to those who can pay the most amount of money for it. oh yes, it was an article about 'internet governance'... and it seems to me that tor could fill the void for an alternative to the dns infrastructure, and provide privacy to users at the same time as fulfilling the need for easy access to the information resources that people wish to make available.
there is some way to remotely enumerate hidden service addresses isn't there? ???

@_subject: Wikipedia and Tor - a solution in the works? 
in my opinion this just highlights the absurdity of the concept of password security on the web, period. in this situation, tor users are vulnerable to tor nodes sniffing the plaintext passwords being sent to the webserver, which is an issue for tor users anyway. However, compromising network nodes in proximity to the wikipedia server could have the same effect. And the same applies to any website.
If the server uses https for password authentication (as is used on hotmail), there is little risk of this occurring. But there is still an opening, which is the man in the middle attack, where a node between the server and the routes out to the rest of the internet could be compromised as well, and the https security becomes null and void.
So, in essence, the problem here is not just something you find with wikipedia, it applies to every site, encrypted or not. Encryption is a layer of protection which is difficult but not impossible to violate. All good security systems include two layers of protection, and the simplest and already widely used method for ppp connections should be used, challenge authentication protocols. In this case the simplest way to implement it is to send a challenge code with the page, and when the 'submit' button is clicked, a javascript program hashes the password, and then hashes the password hash with the challenge code. the server then will only authenticate the user if the stored password hash, hashed with the sent challenge code, matches the code sent by the user.
challenge authentication protocols allow a high degree of security over an unencrypted connection, but adding encryption to it creates a double layer for which there is a very thin margin of possibility of compromising of the security of the user login.
as for the problem of new users being registered to permit further attacks on the system, it should be sufficient to a) throttle new user logins on the same ip in the tor exit node addresses and b) use a visual confirmation system, and c) require the use of email confirmation. These sorts of rules must be applied to any high volume website in any case, and close up most of the possibilities for automated user registrations by trolls.
Banning a set of ip addresses is an ignorant and futile method of ensuring security. trolls could set up a number of tor exit nodes, modify their tor client to select exit nodes from their range of tor exit nodes in their control, and have the tor nodes only wake up when a special code is sent with the packet which signifies their use, and then you have a situation where ip addresses which are not in the regular tor exit node cloud can proxy tor connections and then just as suddenly disappear from the tor cloud and thus bypass the ip blocking protection without stopping the user from using tor. i'm sure a modification of a trojan system could produce an unlimited range of short-lived tor exit nodes to use for this purpose, and blocking tor addresses is just asking for this to happen. and i should point out that this strategy, and similar strategies (for example tunneling from the tor exit node to another anonymity/proxy system, even just open proxies) applies to other ways of abusing the tor network.
ultimately the onus rests on the website to come to grips with the fact that tor is just one of many ways to protect source ip address, and there is many ways to compromise this. the only protection is strong authentication systems and smart user registration systems.

as i explained simply in my previous post, all of this is nonsense, much too much complexity. we are covering old ground that sites such as hotmail and yahoo have dealt with long ago, and the strategies they use are effective, although they could easily be tightened up for preventing abuse from any kind of anonymity proxy system. blind signed certificates and external authentication servers add a lot of complexity and complexity in security systems does not equal extra security, it just means more holes you can jimmy (having spent some time as a young man getting up to mischief unlocking things that i wasn't supposed to get into, i learned one thing: security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain - if the janitor forgets to lock all the windows you might as well not even have locks on the Don't just search.

i think it would be stupid to trust any unknown entity whether official or not in any case. in some ways official entities are less trustworthy because they can be made to bend over by possibly immoral law enforcement. the only way to trust is to build up a relationship of ongoing fulfillment of trust.
yes, i had already thought about this one too, and both constitute security issues in tor which should be considered. the use of ssl allows a significant degree of safety against password sniffing, but, as you said, there is some scope for spoofing the browser, but it's a pretty narrow one, the CAs are unlikely to sign a certificate for an ip address which which is already registered with them. But if the server operators of a site haven't been completely careful with their security the server keys could be taken and used to mount just such attacks, so man in the middle attacks mainly hinge upon the compromise of the remote site's security practises.
you did not read me correctly. the password hash is stored on the server, not the password, the password must be hashed on the browser, and then the hash hashed with the challenge code. it is not possible to break this type of authentication unless the hash algorithm is weak.
i have yet to encounter a competent authentication system which does not store passwords as hashes (although as is well known, the md4 lmhashes in windows are weak), this is the reason behind password recovery systems. the javascript must accurately reproduce the combined hash of the password hash and the challenge code, which means the server will not authenticate if this is not done correctly, so the javascript code is not a weak point in the security. if it is compromised this is again the fault of the security practises of the server operator. the use of the challenge code and combined hash is not breakable without compromising the server, and this is the least of the potential attacks that could be mounted if one can compromise the server anyway. without ssl on the authentication system it is facile to mount a man-in-the-middle attack by injecting code into the javascript to send the plaintext elsewhere (especially from a tor exit node, or an upstream node from the exit node), but with ssl the man-in-the-middle attack takes compromising two security systems if ssl is used, not just one, and both of these attack vectors require lax security on the server operator's part, and if the server is compromised, as i said, this is the least of the potential attacks that could be undertaken (and being that there is serious legal consequences arising from having a rooted public server, it is unlikely that any serious operator would permit this to happen)
