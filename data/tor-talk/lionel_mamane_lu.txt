That's because privoxy will stop your Google cookie from getting to
Google. You can configure it (privoxy) not to stop that cookie, but
then you loose much of your anonymity, he. In this case, you could
even tell firefox/squid not to use privoxy for google.com, if you
don't care about any anonymity for your Google searches.

Additionally, Google now seems to - at last!!!! - obey your browser's
language preferences. In your browser's preferences, somewhere, you
can tell it what languages it should ask web sites to give
you. Assuming Privoxy doesn't "scrub" that, too, it should work. (You

@_subject: reconsidering default exit policy 
AFAIK, it would.
At first sight, this looks like a BOGON list; these are IP ranges that
aren't allocated to anyone NOW (plus "special use"). So if anyone uses
these addresses NOW, it is a nasty spoofer. But these addresses can
get allocated in the future, it is thus *critical* for
interoperability that these bogon filters be used ONLY if the filter
*will* get updated *often* automatically, e.g. from
 . And never in "configure once and don't
touch it" mode.
I might be a good idea to filter out multicast space, though. That's
224.0.0.0/4. And other "special use" spaces:
            0.0.0.0/8		"this" network - only for source,
            10.0.0.0/8		covered
            127.0.0.0/8		covered
            169.254.0.0/16	covered
            172.16.0.0/12	covered
            192.0.2.0/24	reserved for documentation and examples
            192.168.0.0/16	covered
            198.18.0.0/15	reserved for benchmarks
            240.0.0.0/4		"reserved for future use", and listed
(multicast plus reserved aggregate to 224.0.0.0/3)
TCP connections to 6to4 auto-router space (192.88.99.0/24) don't make
much sense either; we can filter those.

Tony's point was that you could arrange not to have the authentication
tokens anymore. You better hope they believe you when you say you
don't have it, though. And under at least some EU registrations, some
people have a right to remain silent. Like the accused person, for
example. And people that have a right to remain silent can refuse to
hand over cryptographic keys.
Not that some powers haven't been known to first interrogate you as
"unrelated witness" (neither you, nor your family, is accused), where
remaining silent is obstruction of justice and punishable, and _then_
charge you with the information thus gleaned.

That's preposterous. What *might* count is wilfully destroying them on
suspecting they will ask them. Simply not having them? Won't stand in
any reasonable court. Else they could ask *me* for *your* keys. I
don't have them. And put me in jail?

@_subject: data remanence (was: Some legal trouble with TOR in France) 
Flash is writable, so can be tampered. The critical secret (the
server's key) is in the ro part. So what good is it?
Really, guys. If it is protection against governments you want, you
are barking up the wrong tree. Too difficult.

My reasoning was that the server key is long-lived, and that from the
key and a communication transcript, one can decrypt everything. I make
this error more often. When using DH, you can have perfect forward
secrecy, which is exactly avoiding this attack.

The chaos computer club runs a tor node (in Germany); they
semi-regularly get accusatory letters from police; they have a form
letter explaining what tor is and containing legal reasoning as to why
what they are doing is OK. Police used to be angry at them, but
apparently they more or less about tor-like things now, and the answer
they get now is like "oh, I see, sorry, goodbye".
Roger also told me he had a German lawyer up his sleeve that is
willing to defend any tor node operator in Germany. (Was it pro bono?
I'm not sure anymore.)
Personally, I think Germany is one of the safest countries to run a
tor node in.
I think it is actually illegal in France (a mere anonymous remailer
is), but (in the anonymous remailer case), there is at least one
long-standing anonymous remailer in France; his owner has had
experiences similar to Olivier (he might actually have spent a night
or two at the police station), but he never got charged ("inculp?").

That's only for civil cases; with penal cases the individual people
acting for the organisation are accused. So, if part of your job is
murdering people... You still go to prison for murder.
As to shielding your private life, if you are an officer of the
verein, I'd expect they can search your home as an establishment of
the verein.

@_subject: court trial against me - the outcome 
A judge found you guilty without hearing from you, nor summoning you
to a trial? That sounds like a ... dangerous procedure. Well, I
suppose you could see it as equivalent to an offer by the public
ministry to settle. Maybe. I'm not sure.
My German is not that fresh anymore, but it seems to say that if your
guilt is low and they don't find any interest for society at large to
prosecute you, they can choose not to prosecute. Is that what that
paragraph says?

No, alas, no. I think most people will stay with servers and the EU,
so your email to/from them will be in "the system". Although maybe not
in a form that is convenient for the authorities to query (they have
to mass-send requests to several ISPs...).
Another solution is using your *own* server. That would be kinda
funny... Have the police call you to get logs about you.
Because you are criminally liable for it and they don't? More
seriously, I suppose that if they actually believe you when you say it
is an accident and you show that you took appropriate precautions
(off-site backups, ...), then they will not make you (big)
problems. There is ?lost by accident? and ?lost by ?accident??. Not
entirely the same.

They could be understood as recording traffic / content data on
demand, not collect / store everything by default and keep it for
queries about the past. Wouldn't a law that compels ISPs to start to
record data about a particular user when the police asks it (with a
court order or otherwise vetted order) fulfil that treaty?
