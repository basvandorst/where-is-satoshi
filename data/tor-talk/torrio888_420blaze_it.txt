@_subject: [tor-talk] Snowflake vs China 
Could Chinese censors successfully block most of the snowflakes by running several machines that would automatically send requests to the snowflake broker and collect IP addresses of snowflakes?
They cold randomize the requests to look more natural and they could spoof their IP addresses like they did when they used active probing to collect non-obfuscated Tor bridges so that broker operator cannot identify and block IP addresses of their probing servers.
