The details indeed does differ :-)
In Denmark, the implementation of the EU-directive (which is called
'logningsbekendtg?relsen')  is not bad news for Tor-operators.
If you have a Tor-server in Denmark, you don't have to log *anything*!
I have this in writing (from something called IT- og Telestyrelsen), if
anybody is interested.
Regarding to the danish 'version' of Vorratsdatenspeicherung
('logningsbekendtg?relsen'), you only have to log data, that you /know/.
That means, if you eg. have an open access point, then normally you do
not know which physical persons have a specific IP-address, and
therefore you do not have to log that.
If you are non-commercial (eg. Tor-operaters normally are), then you do
not have to log *anything*. That means a private open access point does
not have to be register anything.
So if you want to host a Tor-server somewhere in Denmark, feel free to
contact me by e-mail if i can be at any help.

Where is it possible to buy the T-shirt? I have to get it shipped to Europe (Denmark).

@_subject: New swedish survailance law. 
Sweden has introduced a new law. A copy of all traffic crossing the borders of Sweden has to be delivered to an intelligence agency called FRA.
This affects nodes in Sweden, but also countries like Finland (80% of Finland's international traffic goes through Sweden.).
The law is set to take affect 2009-01-01.

Would you use exit-servers from Denmark? We also have data retention,
although not the exact same law as in Germany (but implemented from the
same EU-directive).
You should lobby the EU politicians in the parliament - there is a lack
of interest groups explaining the problems to them (i was just down
there for some weeks ago with a danish interest group. The politicians
told us that groups like us are very rare, and that they only get input
from big companies etc. with economic interests). So get up from the
chair and lobby, course nobody else is doing it! :-)

I must admit that i did not think of this when i set up my danish

I hate censorship. Stupid stupid IFPI et al.

Or maybe not.. It seems that i can not get an IP via DHCP and manually
change the DNS-resolver address, because (as far as i can see) shell
support is removed in recent Tor-ramdisk releases. What do i do then?

Erilenz wrote, On 2009-11-17 14:57:
If you send a 1 kByte packet through a Tor node (lets forget the
overhead for now), the Tor node has to download the packet and upload it
to the next node (or endpoint) which equals 2 kByte traffic on the
internetconnection for the specific Tor node.
If you send a 1 kByte packet through Tor (again forget about overhead)
the traffic used in the network will be ~6 kByte (packetsize * 2 *
If you send through two hops instead of three, you will genereate 4
kByte traffic instead of 6 kByte. Thats 67% not 75%. You are forgetting
that between nodes, the packet has to be uploaded _and_ downloaded again
(both things cost bandwidth).
With regards to reducing the number of hops i agree with Andrew about
using something else than Tor.

Great. Thanks for implementing the feature!
My exit-node is running right now, and everything seems to work.
I am using one of the publicly available DNS-resolvers at
