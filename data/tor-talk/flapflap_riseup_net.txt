You might as well be interested in GNU Guix
  a package manager for the GNU system.
It allows you to install pre-built packages, or just download the source
and build locally with separable build environments.
    "Finally, Guix takes a purely functional approach to package
  management, as described in the introduction (see Introduction). Each
  /gnu/store package directory name contains a hash of all the inputs
  that were used to build that package?compiler, libraries, build
  scripts, etc. This direct correspondence allows users to make sure a
  given package installation matches the current state of their
  distribution. It also helps maximize build reproducibility: thanks to
  the isolated build environments that are used, a given build is likely
  to yield bit-identical files when performed on different machines (see
  container).
  This foundation allows Guix to support transparent binary/source
  deployment. When a pre-built binary for a /gnu/store item is available
  from an external source?a substitute, Guix just downloads it and
  unpacks it; otherwise, it builds the package from source, locally (see
  Substitutes)."
    "Today, each individual?s control over their own computing is at the
  mercy of institutions, corporations, and groups with enough power and
  determination to subvert the computing infrastructure and exploit its
  weaknesses. While using hydra.gnu.org substitutes can be convenient,
  we encourage users to also build on their own, or even run their own
  build farm, such that hydra.gnu.org is less of an interesting target.
  Guix has the foundations to maximize build reproducibility (see
  Features). In most cases, independent builds of a given package or
  derivation should yield bit-identical results. Thus, through a diverse
  set of independent package builds, we can strengthen the integrity of
  our systems.
  In the future, we want Guix to have support to publish and retrieve
  binaries to/from other users, in a peer-to-peer fashion. If you would
  like to discuss this project, join us on guix-devel at gnu.org."
An interesting talk on Guix was given this August at GNU Hacker's

@_subject: [tor-talk] Liability to Prosecution for Operating Tor Nodes in 
FYI (both only in German):
(via (I'm not familiar with the language of law, just try to summarize it to
inform you; maybe someone else could translate it more accurately...)
A court in Austria ruled that one can be held liable to prosecution for
operating a Tor Exit [but likely also Middle] Node, when it is used by
someone to commit a criminal action.
The judge justifies the decision by ?12 of the penal code:
"Not only the direct perpetrator commits a criminal action, but also
everyone who appoints someone else to commit it or otherwise adds to its
what a sad and poor decision :(
To cite (and roughly translate) Fefe:
"As a precaution, Austrians should stop operating communication
infrastructure like Jabber, email, and web servers with comment or
upload functionality, or telephones and fax machines. If I [Fefe] were
the post, I [Fefe] would stop operations, too."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Merging all languages (locales) into one Tor Browser 
David Bala?ic:
The users do not have to choose their language again/one more time:
Now, they already do this choice -- before downloading TBB through the
What I'm saying is, having the user choose to download only one package
and then selecting the language is just the reverse as is done at the
moment, not a new/additional step.
I'm not sure if the order doesn't matter, because (maybe) you're in
another mood ("calm", "reading", "searching") when browsing the
torproject website, whereas when you launch TBB you want to see
something/get to your goal soonish..

@_subject: [tor-talk] Profiling Tor users via keystrokes 
(I didn't find this topic discussed here yet and I think it might be
the article
says that apparently it's possible to deanonymise Tor users by analysing
their keystrokes in input fields of websites.
Is it valid to assume that such a technique is possible to be deployed
by, for example, cloudflare? (needs JavaScript, has an input field)
(or is it required for learning to always enter the same text by the
same user?)
Is there need for modifications in the Tor Browser Bundle/upstream Firefox?
