@_subject: [tor-talk] FTP Hidden Service 
I have an FTP hidden service, the ftp daemon is listening only to my loopback. There is no problem to connect to my FTP account through Firefox or lftp but I am unable to connect with Filezilla or Total Commander - directory listing fails (see the error message below). The FTP daemon opens a passive port on the server and the directory listing is ready there (I checked it with netcat) but my FTP client doesn't connect to the passive port (all passive ports are listed in torrc hidden service config). How is it possible there is no problem to list directories through firefox bundle but I am unable to list content of the same account through Filezilla or Total Commander? (my settings are passive mode, socks4, socks4a, socks5, long timeout - nothing works).
