I'm a newbie in Onionland?I installed TBB on my Linux machine 2 days
ago?and I have a question:
My computer is old and I can't afford to run Firefox non-stop, so I close
it when I don't use it and leave Vidalia running (I have a relay set up).
When I try to run Firefox again from "tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/"
directory by clicking on "firefox" executable, it fails to run. If I run it
in terminal like this ".App/Firefox/firefox -no-remote -profile
./Data/profile/ &" it opens successfully, but I get the following message: "
*The proxy server is refusing connections. Firefox is configured to use a
proxy server that is refusing connections.*" So how should I start the
browser correctly when Vidalia is already running?

Hmm... I'm a bit sad to hear that because it's very inconvenient for some
of us to run Firefox 24/7 just because we'd like to help the network with
relaying. Perhaps in the future you will make it a bit more user-friendly
in this regard.

OK, I just tried this and it seems to be working. I installed Tor and
Vidalia from official Tor Ubuntu repository (deb
  main) and I'm using
browser from TBB package.

I can do all these things and more, but I prefer GUI. Many Linux
distributions are moving away from "hard-core geek approach", but at the
same time even on distros like Ubuntu you can still do everything the old
As I said: I'm new to Tor and I thought because Vidalia includes the option
to run relay this must be the right way to do it. Anyway, I found a
solution that works for me. Thank you guys...
