@_subject: How to contact tor-ops? 
today I have started a tor server. As described in the documentation I have to inform the tor ops about this fact.
So I have send an email to ?tor-ops at freehaven.net .

syverson at fw5540.nrl.navy.mil... Deferred: Connection timed out with Warning: message still undelivered after 4 hours

WHAT DOES IT MEAN? Who is: syverson at fw5540.nrl.navy.mil?
Could someone explain what "fw5540.nrl.navy.mil" is. navy.mil scares me a little bit.

@_subject: confiscating middleman-tor-nodes 
mine (stasiServer) has also gone away yesterday.
The public prosecutors authority told me it has to do with child pornography Look like some pervert have used tor to get some CP. :(
He also told me on the phone that they are hunting for traces.
I have to write a letter to public prosecutors authority to get more information about what is going on and why. He will answer on monday.
I don't know how this normally happens, but should't they inform me that they took my server hostet at Strato? Big shit :( Maybe this is the beginning of some kind of anti TOR war because police cannot find "terrorists" which are using TOR. But to make TOR more evil in the public they start saying that perverts are using TOR to get CP.
Just my 2 euro cents...

@_subject: confiscating middleman-tor-nodes 
I hopefully get on monday some information why they did it.
There are several articles in german internet news. The prosecutor said something about CP and TOR. On the short telephone call he did not explain me a lot but he has confirmed that the  Office of Criminal Investigation will scan for traces of those people because they used TOR to get the CP. No idea how they want to do this.
If they find something then TOR isn't good. If they don't find anything, TOR is fine.

@_subject: 20090101 (log data) 
do you know what is a timestamp in terms of this law? today, 11pm....
does tor really change the packets 1 by 1? or is it that data comes in, is buffered and then send with other data to a different tor server (middle man). If yes then tor middlenode does not offer any public service where you replace an ID by an other. (Whatever you mean by ID)
exit nodes still can be run outside europe. I will quit from my german server provider and get one somewhere else asap.
What they ask for email is stupid. Every one will go to a server which is not in the EU. But still I will keep some email account in the EU and enter this address everywhere where I expect to get spam from. PS: what happens if the logged data is lost by accident? If the Bundeswehr looses data why not me?

@_subject: 20090101 (log data) 
Timing attacs can be done only with accurate data. What if my server has a wrong time or its clock is changing speed randomly or ...
I think some more clever people then me will come up with an idea soon.
I am sure tor developers will soon improve tor. We should of course do a lot in fighting this law but we should do more in improving tor.
Promote tor or the idea of anonymous web access in universities. Why should it not be "cool" to make a masters degree in improving anonymity?
Why not create a "overnet" where your IP address is only seen when you log in to the "overnet" but what you do inside is hidden. I have big hope in the smart guys and girls around us :) (I do not talk about the a***oles in the government)

@_subject: court trial against me - the outcome 
Guten Abend,
I have also received such a letter some time ago but I went to the police and explained. Of course you have to take care what you say and do not say too much. The police tried to frighten me that "normally" they come to check my flat and this is nothing nice and I should stop TOR. I asked him if he is still well. To check my flat because of a 100? case where someone claims to have logs with my IP address which are plain text files and can be modified by any idiot is a little too much. He said: well we do it in Bavaria (Bayern) like this. So I asked about "Verh?ltnissm?ssigkeit der Mittel" (like you do not shoot somebody down because he said something wrong against you) but there was no answer.  After a while I have received a letter that the case was stopped.
This country needs an revolution!
Gr?sse und Kopf hoch!

There is already a thread about this organization/fund.
I am watching it carefully because I am interested.
It looks for like like we need a legal costs insurance (Rechtschutzversicherung)  for tor admins.

@_subject: Help Iranian dissidents 
if this is a crisis and who is the good guy and the bad guy should in my opinion not be discussed on this list.
Not everyone might share your view of "dissidents". Some might call those guys It is very good you are helping people to get to use tor. I am also promoting it whenever I can.
I hope what Karsten N. has writen yesterday is not yet forgotten:
"And I hope, tor will stay political neutral."
I would like to extend tor to also or-talk and everything else related to tor. i will keep my server running even I know some guys I dont like are using it.
