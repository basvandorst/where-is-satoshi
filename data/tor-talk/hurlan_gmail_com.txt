@_subject: Tor Signature Key 
I'not a dumb but tried to check "tor-0.1.2.17-win32.exe" validity againt "
tor-0.1.2.17-win32.exe.asc"..... get errors with gpg, no ID signature
never workes, I tried also  find the orignal key which was used for the
signature on the Tor website but didn't succed.... Should be more simply
usually isn't it ?
