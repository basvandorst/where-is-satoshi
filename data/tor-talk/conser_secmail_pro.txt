@_subject: [tor-talk] Using a Solid Tor Configuration 
Hi all,
I would like to setup a solid Tor configuration in the States. I get a lot
of harassment from corrupted law enforcement and nosy corporations. My
goal is to keep my online activity private, but it appears Tor isn't doing
that at all.
Should I use Linux or Windows with Tor and how do I make it work well
enough to stop these kind of attackers?
Thanks in advance for your help.
