A heads-up for fellow Ubuntu users: The tor package has been removed
from Ubuntu Jaunty due to lack of maintainership.

I'm glad that we have someone(s) dedicated to building usable packages
for Ubuntu, but I admit I'm curious why we do it outside of the normal
Ubuntu universe.  Would it not be better to apply this same amount of
effort and skill within the Ubuntu (or Debian) repositories rather
than being off on an island?  I can't back this up with statistics,
but my gut feeling just tells me the less work a user has to do to
install a product like Tor the better for wide-spread distribution.
I don't think it's fair to say "they" haven't gotten around to fixing
these packages when it's our product they've been shipping.  The onus
should be on the Tor community to have someone managing such packages
rather than expecting the distro owners to do all the work for us.
Would you blame Microsoft or Apple for people running out of date
versions under Windows and Mac?  I'm not trying to belittle the
efforts made with the Ubuntu packages in any way, I just find it a bit
odd that the efforts aren't focused on being a more well integrated
product.  I can't imagine it would be significantly more work, yet it
seems there would be a definite benefit for end users.
