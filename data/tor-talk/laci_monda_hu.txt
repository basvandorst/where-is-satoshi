I don't understand why majordomo is used nowadays.  Mailman is so much
simpler and more intuitive to use.

@_subject: Repeatedly changing unique exit nodes 
Hi List,
I'd like to change exit nodes in every n secs in a way that I don't
want the same exit node to be repeated within m secs.
I can partially solve the problem with the following configuration:
NewCircuitPeriod n
MaxCircuitDirtiness n
But I don't know how to satisfy the "don't repeat the same exit node
within m secs" condition.
Thanks in advance!

There's no way I'll ever run out of exit nodes because in my case n is
about 30 and m is about 600.
Unforuntaly I still don't know how to enforce the "don't repeat the
same exit node within m secs" condition.

I certainly know more than "a little bit of PHP" and I have no evil
purposes in my mind, but I'm not sure I wanna dwelve this deep into
Thanks for the links though, they're interesting reads.
