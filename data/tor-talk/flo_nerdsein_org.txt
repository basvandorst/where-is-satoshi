@_subject: [tor-talk] anyone created an acct on GMX using Tor? 
I looks like as they blocked the most Tor exits and also a lot of people trying to make an account at GMX, and they block IPs after 3 created accounts per day...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Minimum system for hidden service 
32MB is a bit very minimal, especially since almost any linux distri needs
at least 64-128MB for just loading the installer in RAM, etc.
If you would increase your requirements up to 128MB you would be fine. Then
I would recommend the pretty stable debian for your needs :)
Of course debian isn't that pre-configured as tails is, but you can do that
at your own.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS provider 
The problem is especially on container-virtualizations like OpenVZ is
that the admins of the hostnodes must just type something like 'vzctl
enter 123' and they have a shell in your VPS...
So you should have at least Xen/KVM where you can use encryption
