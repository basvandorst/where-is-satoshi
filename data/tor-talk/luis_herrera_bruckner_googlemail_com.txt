I have experimented with file transfer using the Tor IM Browser Bundle, with
files (already encrypted) from 1K to 1M, in these ways:
1) upload and download the file to a free Internet filehosting service (
mediafire.com), 2) email the file as an attachment, and 3) send the file
during a Pidgin private conversation. In the first two cases, the download
attempt sometimes pops up a warning message that a "NOT Tor safe" external
application must be launched.  Other times, the warning does not appear.  I
can't distinguish any pattern as to when the warning does or does not
appear.  There's a different launch problem in Pidgin.  If you click on the
"Authenticate" link to authenticate the other party for a private
conversation, Internet Explorer gets launched without warning (this doesn't
happen if instead you use OTR from the menu).  Also, the file transfer
sometimes completes, and sometimes you get a message saying that one side or
the other cancelled the transfer (even though that didn't happen); whether
the transfer is cancelled seems independent of the file size.
Any help with these issues would be greatly appreciated.

Hello Andrew,
Thank you very much for your response.  Comments below as ***
*** Firefox; that is, the version bundled with the Tor IM Browser
package, running from a USB stick.  I have attached a screenshot of
the warning message.  I have no idea what is the application that
would be launched.  I can send you the link to the file if you'd like
(the file is encrypted and about 800 KB).
*** Yes, that is what I thought.  Is there a way to tell the portable
Tor-enabled Firefox browser, "always use me and don't launch any other
browser"?  Otherwise, wouldn't any request made through another
browser completely bypass the Tor circuit?  That would be an
especially serious problem if the default browser installed on the
host PC was Firefox, since it would be easy to assume that you're
routing all your requests through Tor, when In fact they're being sent
through the non-Tor host-installed Firefox browser.
*** Thanks, that makes sense.

Hi Andrew,
Thanks very much.  About the launch external application warning:
there does seem to be a consistent pattern - it happens with some
sites always, and with other sites never.  So it seems that each site
decides how to handle the file downloads.  I'm sure you can tell I'm a
"newbee" (I think that's the word in English?) who doesn't understand
the technical details, but from common sense, I don't see how it is
that, even if the site launches an external application to do the file
download, that this application launch would "unmask" you, since where
could that application send the traffic except to the Tor exit node,
and what information would it know besides what is provided by the Tor
exit node?  This is a completely different problem than the one in
which you accidentally launch a different browser; in the case of
downloading files with the launch external application warning, you're
still using the same Tor-enabled Firefox browser.  Thanks again.
