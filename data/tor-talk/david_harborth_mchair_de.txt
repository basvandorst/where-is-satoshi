Dear Tor list members,
my name is David Harborth and I am a PhD student at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. I am currently working for a project called AN.ON-Next ( where we investigate different anonymization services. For that purpose, we want to compare several services and the corresponding perceptions of users about them. Tor is one of these services we want to investigate with the help of an online survey.
