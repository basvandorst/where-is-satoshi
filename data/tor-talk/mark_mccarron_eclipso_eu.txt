I would be wary of Android.  Its is complex to secure given the closed nature of most handsets.
Unless manufactures provide the complete source, tools to flash chips, proper docs on chips and devices unlocked, I would never use such device for secure access to Tor.
Presuming these devices have been designed to be accessible by governments is a wise bet. It probably the real reason behind devices not providing root access or the ability to do custom installs and the various laws to enforce that.

You are on Android 4.4?
Orweb is done moving forward regardless, so I would generally say yes.
However, Orfox is still very early (not alpha yet) and has not been fully tested. I would either do your own testing and report back to us, or only use the app for non sensitive/critical browsing for now.

It is the closed nature of the device that leaves a sense of distrust.  With respect to the OS, I don't think any OS could be declared safe without some form of analysis by AI specifically designed to review code and test against hardware.
I would like to see an open source effort to deliver such testing and certification.
I would really like to.
I will check it out, thanks,

It will not be a fork. Anything I do will be submitted for inclusion in the main branch when ready.
Quite a number of the changes I mentioned are in the pipeline anyway.

So it's pointless to continue using Tor or any related tech. You ?ASAP?
mods are going to be broken even faster.
I was hoping for ?reading? instead of just look it up. But it's up to you.
I guess the whole list will welcome you with your fork. It would be
harder with getting the qualified eyes for peer review, tho.

I find it interesting that changes put forward by a group funded by every major three letter intelligence agency makes it into tor.  More interesting is the fact that these changes hide who you are connected to and the ability to change that.
That's highly exploitable. What's going on here?
