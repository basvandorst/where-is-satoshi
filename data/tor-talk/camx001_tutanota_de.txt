@_subject: [tor-talk] allowing javascripts and using bookmarks 
I just wanted to ask a few things.
I use?Tutanota.de?for email.? a couple bank websites and facebook.? But in order for them to work I have to enable javascript.
Will it put me at risk to enable scripts in these cases?
Also, does it put me at risk to use bookmarks?

@_subject: [tor-talk] send email through the Tor network 
If I use a web email using the tor browser, does that mean the email will be sent through the tor network?
