Dear Tor List Readers:
Windows and a Broadcom [linux drivers unavailable]-[ndiswrapper too
much effort] pci 802.11 wireless card complicate my setup.
If you have any suggestions to improve my Tor's stability, I would
appreciate hearing back from you, as I would like to get the internet
working more reliably.
dd-wrt+tor firmware, vmware Tor machine, or something else, but would
ideally prefer a windows fix: Tor drops connections often, and churns,
quickest way to continue is to close Tor and restart.  Any
 firefox. Tor v0.1.1.21, vidalia 6, privoxy. XP media center edition
Broadcom chip based Linksys PCI 802.11g card. \PCI\VEN_1814&DEV_020
utorrent1.6 linksys v.5 router dd-wrt v.23

There was a greasemonkey script --- maybe the one that showcased the
vulnerability that allowed greasemonkey to execute local control over
user files (?.3) - that did basic encrypt/decrypt of pgp on web pages;
an example of a greasemonkey encryption scheme for gmail,
"using a system similar to AES" - Mark Langenhoven ---
---see attached greasemonkey script.
