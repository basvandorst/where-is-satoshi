Actually meant if some of you anon folks knew if it was possible to
perform this deanonymisation without javascript. The "fuck javascript"
part that i know :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] A possible solution to traffic correlation attacks, 
Seems like an interesting idea, but this at the end translates into you
opening a webpage,
and it not loading for minutes. Only adding seconds or milliseconds
wouldn't avoid correlation,
or it wouldn't become much more expensive.
One other idea that comes to my mind would be to cache on the network
some amount of the
requests, or replicate part of the content of say, hidden services in
other nodes. In this way,
requests to hidden services may not reach at all the hidden service
itself, but a replica of it.
This is in a way similar to what Freenet does.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-Friendly Two-Factor Authentication? 
As far as I know, to implement 2 factor authentication in terms of the
codes that many websites have, the only thing you need is to generate
random numbers coming from seed that the webpage/bank you want to
authenticate to know. This simple setup by no means need to be privacy

It usually works well, but for instance, when running firefox (or other
browser with it) it may leak your DNS requests, so beware of that.
To avoid this you could edit /etc/resolv.conf to
nameserver 127.0.0.1
and your requests will be resolved through tor.

A wide-scale study of online trackers carried out by researchers at
Princeton University has identified a new technique being used to try to
strip web users of their privacy, as well as quantifying the ongoing
usage of some better-known tracking techniques.
The new technique unearthed by the study is based on fingerprinting a
machine?s audio stack via the AudioContext API. So it?s not collecting
sound played or recorded on a machine but rather harvesting the audio
signature of the individual machine and using that as an identifier to
track a web user.
I understand that these methods are not possible without javascript, are
The example provided in the webpage:
uses fingerprintjs2 library.
Any thoughts?

VFEMail login works, the problem is that their free tier mail sometimes
observes massive delays in delivery. They even have a hidden service to
check your mail in the browser.
