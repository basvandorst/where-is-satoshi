One can download [2] the source code needed to build her own amnesia
Live System using the Debian Live tools as a tarball or using a Git
repository. Pre-built images can also be downloaded [2] using BitTorrent.
Disclaimer: this is the first public release of alpha software that
can kill your kitten, etc.
The aim of this announcement is to get feedback from Tor enthusiasts
early in amnesia's development process.
=> any comments welcome!
We have contacted the Incognito developers to discuss possible
collaboration... as they recently publicly stated their intent to
switch to another base distribution.
To contact the amnesia developers, one can send email to
amnesia at boum.org, preferably encrypted [3].

Runa A. Sandvik wrote (24 Aug 2010 18:48:58 GMT) :
T(A)ILS is the result of the merge of the Incognito and Amnesia Live
systems; It is listed on the Tor Projects page [1].
Is it imaginable to add the T(A)ILS website [2] to the Tor project's
Pootle instance? Rationale: on the one hand our website already offers a translation
interface based on PO files; on the other hand, some of our
translators have expressed the need for a better UI. They are used to
Pootle's one. They would love it if the "Improve translation" link
present on almost every page of our site did point to Pootle.
Technical details: our website is based on ikiwiki and is managed with
Git. We can provide the needed access via ssh keys to enable Pootle to
read from and write to our Git repository. From the Pootle version
control documentation [3] I can infer our website's layout falls into
the "special directory layouts" category that needs a bunch of
symlinks to emulate the "standard" Pootle directory layout. I'm sure
we can easily provide a script that creates and maintains the needed
symlinks in a target directory that Pootle could work on.
Our Git repository additionally contains PO files for a few programs
that are specific to T(A)ILS. I guess they also could be translated
using Pootle provided the symlinks are properly maintained.
Thoughts and comments welcome both on technical and non-technical

Gregory Maxwell wrote (22 Aug 2010 00:55:49 GMT) :
I doubt there is something like "the" best way of using Tor. One
always needs to balance the risks vs. the efforts needed to get some
protection against it. More practically speaking: there are use cases
the Tor Browser Button is perfect for, but it cannot prevent every
leakage of anonymity to local disks. Then come Tor-ified VM setups
that protect users a bit more but still somehow rely on the host
operating system. Then comes running a Tor-ified Live system such as
T(A)ILS?[1] on bare metal. Each situation has its best fit solution
but I don't think one solution can be told to be best in any cases.
  [1] About performance: a five years old laptop with 1.7 GHz processor and
1GB RAM is able to run a fully-fledged Tor-ified desktop system such
as T(A)ILS in VirtualBox. It was also true with qemu+kqemu last time I
About complexity: running a guest OS in a VM is really easy with
VirtualBox (and presumably with its proprietary counterparts). But
maybe I am missing the point. What kind of complexity are you talking
Another "cost" mentioned by coderman was "elevated privs for
accelerated virtualization / para-virtualization". AFAIK VirtualBox
does not need any special privileges (once the kernel part of the
software is installed, and the modules/services loaded).
Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not a fan of VM-based solutions and
pretty much prefer the bare-metal + Live OS approach, but I feel we
need to consider their pros and cons in a more detailed way than
discarding them on the assumption that their cost must be too high
else we would push for their usage much more than we do.
I'm sure there are use-cases such a sandbox would fit very well, and
am in favour of developing new ways of using Tor when practical
use-cases make it necessary. If it fits a bunch of (potential) users'
needs, I do encourage you to push this idea forward.
On the other hand: if we want to consider ease of use "for many
people" as an important criterion, which we do, which one seems easier
amongst the two following solutions?
1. Download T(A)ILS and burn it on a CD, then boot it when needed
   (possibly in a VM if you can afford it wrt. performance and
   security).
2. Replace your current OS with another one that supports SE Linux
   well enough to support the SE Linux enhanced sandbox described
   solution (examples needed), install the sandbox front-end program
   that does not exist yet, and setup the needed sandboxes for the
   apps that need to be Tor-ified and somehow isolated. Then you only
   need to never, ever confuse your nice sandboxed web browser with
   your other non-sandboxed one.
As a T(A)ILS developer I am of course biased but  seems pretty much
easier to me.

amnesia?[0] is a Live System similar to (and heavily inspired by)
* all outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through
  the Tor network;
* no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.
Since the initial announcement on this mailing-list in August, a few
releases happened. We're working hand in hand with the Incognito
developers, and amnesia can now be considered as the ground
foundations for the next main Incognito release.
Try it, seed it! Any comments are welcome.
Highlighted changes since August:
* We now ship multilingual ISO images; initially supported (or rather
  wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it, pt, es.
* We now ship "hybrid" ISO images, which can be either burnt on CD-ROM
  or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.
* Icedove (Thunderbird) was replaced with claws mail, in a bit
  rough way.
* Virtual keyboard: kvkbd was replaced with onBoard.
* Tor controller: TorK was replaced with Vidalia.
* Anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting is now made easy for
  end-users.
* Users are now warned at runtime when the amnesia version they are
  running is affected by security flaws, and which ones they are.
* Includes NetworkManager 0.7 to support non-DHCP networking.
* Always use the latest Tor stable release from deb.torproject.org.
* Securely erases RAM on shutdown using smem.
* Added support for running as a guest system in VirtualBox.
* Improved boot time on CD by ordering files in the squashfs in the
  order they are used during boot.

Not yet. I quite like BitTorrent as it gives you a very efficient
mirroring infrastructure for free, once you've got enough peers who
are willing to seed. Moreover, it may be a bit harder to censor
a given .torrent files than a well known HTTP mirrors pool.
But I suppose you're talking about HTTP here, so... what do you mean
by *trusted*? For such a "trusted" mirroring infrastructure to be
useful, people who download amnesia need to be able to trust the
network as well...
IMHO, it is easier (client side) to:
A) trust neither the mirror nor the network, and rely on OpenPGP
   signatures only (=> need for
    - the signing key to be signed by keys in the strong set
    - end-users documentation explaining how to download using
      BitTorrent, how to check OpenPGP signatures
   )
... than to ...
B) trust the mirror, and do what's necessary to be able to trust the
   network too; by "being able to trust the network", I don't mean "to
   trust every Mozilla-approved SSL CA".
Adding a todo item to our wiki[2] would be a good starting point, so
that there's a place to discuss and coordinate it.

connecting to our web site... unless you use Debian.
T(A)ILS can now be downloaded over HTTP [3] in addition to BitTorrent.
We want to thank the various people who already contribute bandwidth
with HTTP mirrors or BitTorrent seeds. We could make use of more, so
drop us an email if you are in a position to help spreading our
ISO images.
Please note we now have a newsletter [4], a web forum [5] and
a chatroom on IRC [6].
  [3]   [4]   [5]   [6] What's new?
Since the last release three months ago, tons of bugs were fixed,
- A trick workarounds the nasty bug that often prevented the system to
  connect to the Tor network.
- New windows don't open in background anymore.
- Memory wiping at shutdown is now lightning fast and does not
  prevent the computer to halt anymore.
- onBoard now correctly autodetects the keyboard layout... at least
  once some keys have been pressed.
- and more!
Other notable changes include:
- Tor 0.2.1.25
- Vidalia 0.2.8
- Claws Mail 3.7.5 with OpenPGP support
- Pidgin automatically connects to irc.oftc.net with a randomized
  nickname, which allows to easily join our new chatroom.
- At shutdown time, only prompt to remove CD; just halt when booted
  from a USB stick.
- User settings ($HOME) are now generated in a programmatic way: no
  more ugly binary files in our source code!
- Forbid any IPv6 communication with the outside.
- Added some wifi drivers: Ralink rt2570, rt2860 and Broadcom STA.
... and of course the usual bunch of software security updates.

  started only once HTP is done. Desktop notifications explain what's
  happening.
- Warn the user when T(A)ILS is running inside a virtual machine.
- Add a Nautilus shortcut to securely erase free space in a partition.
- Preliminary Monkeysphere support: Iceweasel extension is installed,
  MSVA is configured to use a hkps:// keyserver.
- WhisperBack 1.3 lets the user optionally provide an email address
  and OpenPGP key.
A few bugs were fixed, including:
- IPv6 communication with the outside is now really forbidden.
- Torbutton 1.2.5-3 fixes the exposure of a rare User-Agent [4].
- Autostart Iceweasel with the GNOME session to workaround the

* Built on top of Debian Squeeze.
* Tor 0.2.1.30
* Protecting against memory recovery: new, safer way to wipe memory on
  shutdown which is now also used when the boot media is physically
  removed.
* Hardware support
 - printers: install more printer drivers, allow the default user to
   manage more kinds of printers
 - 3G: support mobile broadband devices such as 3G USB dongles
 - wireless: install Atheros and Broadcom firmwares
 - scanner and multi-function peripherals: better support
* Iceweasel
 - install the HTTPS Everywhere extension
 - many Anonymity Set preservation enhancements, mostly inspired by
   the Tor Browser Bundle configuration
 - support FTP, thanks to FoxyProxy
* Other software
 - user-friendly encryption support: install gnome-disk-utility
   (Palimpsest) and Seahorse plugins
 - add opt-in i2p support with Iceweasel integration through FoxyProxy
 - optionally install TrueCrypt at boot time to allow users of the
   (old and now unsupported) *Incognito* live system to access the
   data on previously created media; this is *not* meant to be used to
   create new TrueCrypt media
 - make better use of battery-powered hardware
 - replace xsane with simple-scan which is part of GNOME and way
   easier to use
 - install scribus-ng instead of scribus: more features, less bugs
* Firewall
 - drop incoming packets by default
 - forbid queries to DNS resolvers on the LAN
 - set output policy to drop (defense-in-depth)
* Miscellaneous
 - fromiso= bugfixes
 - configure keyboard layout accordingly to the chosen language for
   Italian and Portuguese
 - more robust HTP time synchronization wrt. network failures;
   display the logs when the clock synchronization fails
 - disable automatic media mounting and opening to protect against

Being relying myself on Firefox profiles / virtual machines rather
than the toggle thing, I'd personally be happy to see it go away.
Let me put my Tails developer hat on. Done. Let's go.
Mike Perry wrote (11 Apr 2011 23:33:08 GMT) :
Context: Tails currently ships Debian's Iceweasel (Firefox renamed for
trademark reasons) and Torbutton. We don't care for the toggle feature
that is unsupported in Tails and generally confusing for Tails users.
Debian has put great efforts [0] to avoid shipping embedded code
copies, and I quite like it from a sysadmin point-of-view, but this is
mostly irrelevant to the current discussion *in the context of Tails*,
so I'll try to put aside my usual rants: if there's a serious security
bug in, say, the FreeType library, we need to release updated Tails
images regardless of the actual technical reason (in case we go on
shipping Debian's Iceweasel with no embedded code copies + Torbutton,
we want to get the updated FreeType Debian package; in case we ship
the TBB, we want to get the new binary statically linked against its
own FreeType copy... I guess).
  [0] This being said... I fear needing to move away from a now-unsupported
Torbutton extension makes our life hard as Tails developers. Two main
issues arise from the top of my head, which I'm going to describe.
Since the end of Torbutton seems inevitable, I do hope my concerns can
easily be dismissed and the new TBB can be a viable solution for our
For various reasons, the Tails Firefox configuration is likely to keep
being a bit different from the TBB's one. If we are forced to use the
TBB instead of our current Debian's Iceweasel+Torbutton, I wonder
how/if we will we be able to maintain this delta. I guess anyone needs
to know a bit how we currently do this, so as to be able to answer
this question of mine. Let me explain a bit.
We Tails developers have invested quite a lot of work to avoid
maintaining in VCS / shipping files into $HOME that are of the binary
kind (be them really binary, or enough of a mess to make the diff
corresponding to a given change hard to understand). Since the good
old amnesia 0.5 days, we've been building such files programmatically
from plaintext, understandable source files build time.
Just like GConf settings, the Tails Firefox profile directory falls
into this category: it's pretty hard to track such a directory in VCS,
change options in there while maintaining consistency, know what files
shall be shipped, which ones are auto-generated at runtime and so on,
among the huge pile of files one can find in a profile directory. To
achieve this we use:
 * a system-wide profile skeleton [1] that mostly contains the
   preferences *.js files and two extensions that have not made their
   way into Debian yet
 * SQLite preferences files are generated at build time [2] from
   plaintext SQL sources [3]
  [1]   [2]   [3] If we migrate to shipping TBB, can we go on maintaining our Tails
specific Firefox configuration delta as described above? Will the
TBB's Firefox use the standard ways to fetch system-wide
configuration? (I guess this should be a opt-in option, probably not
toggle-able from the GUI, as the TBB usually wants to be as much
independent from the host OS as possible.)
For maintainability reasons, we Tails developers tend to prefer
automatic build/upgrade procedures over manually setting up things. We
also tend to prefer benefiting from already existing infrastructure
and processes that work well, and especially Debian's ones, over
setting up our own ones.
For such reasons, I feel it's both cleaner and much less
time-consuming for us to install and ship Firefox extensions from the
Debian archive than manually downloading those, checking file
integrity and unzipping XPI files into the profile skeleton directory.
Maintaining compatibility between various FF versions and various
extensions is also work I would not want to do... especially since
it's already being done by the Debian maintainers for the extensions
we ship. I'd hate having to replicate their work.
Is it imaginable to see the new TBB make use of extensions that are
installed system-wide? (probably opt-in as well)
I'll summarize the discussion results there. In the meantime, I prefer
using email if you don't mind.

I don't know if the root cause of the failure I faced was the slowness

Unless I misunderstood your words, Tails is already using AUFS the way
you are suggesting. Users who feel they seriously know what they're
doing, and want to take the risk, can already use APT to upgrade their
currently running system in RAM. However, we don't generally recommend
doing that for reasons I already highlighted and pointed you at.
The incremental upgrades idea I pointed you at is something entirely
different, though. It's about *persistently* upgrading a system when
a Tails point-release is out, while minimizing the amount of data that
must be downloaded. Please explain how AUFS could be used for solving
that problem, and why it would be better (size-wise, or whatever) than
the stacked SquashFS idea we've been thinking of.
This is merely implementation details. We already have a plan to fix
the "Tails is read-only" side of things (see the stacked SquashFS idea
I pointed you at). The main problem is that Tails is a full Live
system built upon a whole autonomous world (that is, Debian
repositories) that is constantly changing; again:
  Tails is not a random collection of packages that could be
  individually upgraded without any thought. Tails is a carefully
  crafted system that aims at guaranteeing certain properties. We do
  our best to ensure an ISO we ship meets a certain specification.
  There is simply no possible way for us to ensure the same for "that
  ISO plus any number of APT upgrades on top of it".
Please tell me what's unclear in this paragraph.
The only possible way we could propose incremental upgrades through
APT would be to manage our own APT repositories, so that we entirely
control the flow of packages that could flow into a given Tails
system. Personally, I don't think it would be worth the effort, and
I still think it makes sense to go the "incremental upgrades using
stacked SquashFS" way we've been pursuing. In any case, the APT way
would make bug reporting, reproducing, debugging and fixing much more
complicated: currently, one runs "Tails 0.9", not "Tails 0.9 plus this
and that upgrades".
Also, please be kind enough to quickly sum-up what is the exact
problem you are suggesting us to solve, so that other Tails developers
don't need to read the whole thread to (try to) understand what the
problem could be, among discussions about implementation details.

Ack. On second thought, it appears to me the current T(A)ILS "wipe
memory on shutdown" implementation does not necessarily protect
against the attacks that the mentioned talk will probably highlight.
It is likely that some other similar implementations in Live systems
are affected as well.
In short: we wipe *free* memory only, in order to keep the system in
working state and let the shutdown sequence finish its work afterwards
(i.e. actually halt or reboot the system). On the other hand, data
saved in the {union,au}fs ramdisk branch is not free memory and might
thus be recovered. A security announce about this is being worked on
(explaining this problem and the possible consequences to
non-technical users is, well, tricky).
The kexec idea seems brilliant to me: this is the best way I can think
of to run the memory wipe process inside an environment where almost
all of the memory is considered as being free.
I have thus started implementing this idea in T(A)ILS. Thanks to
Debian's initramfs-tools and kexec-tools, drafting an early prototype
was quite easy. Stay tuned, more to come soon.
T(A)ILS specification and security design document (draft almost ready
to be published to a wild, unsuspecting world) intends to propose a

Thank you. This is much appreciated.
In my humble opinion your package shall be pushed to Debian and Ubuntu
(or at least to deb.torproject.org) before user awareness is the top
priority. Rationale: I'm not a fan of recommending users to install
.deb from any random online repository (no offense intended); trusting
a given APT source almost equals trusting this repository's admins and
package maintainers to be root on your system.
I don't think pushing this package to Debian and Ubuntu is that hard
and I suggest the following process:
0. If not done yet, compare the default polipo configuration you are
   shipping with the Tor Browser Bundle's and T(A)ILS' ones, just to
   make sure no privacy/anonymity-related option was missed.
1. Make sure your package is in good enough shape so that it can be
   included in Debian (=> Debian users can use it as well, and Ubuntu
   will fetch it from there in a few months). I mean checking the
   Debian Policy compliance, making sure it is Lintian-clean, etc.
2. Fill a Request For Package (RFP) bug in the Debian BTS [0] so that
   any Tor-friendly Debian developer is aware of your work and can
   decide to upload your package into Debian.
3. Mention the RFP bug on the Debian bug that tracks the polipo vs.
   torbutton port mismatch [1], and reciprocally.
4. Wait for the package to be uploaded into Debian.
5. Wait for the package to be fetched from Debian by Ubuntu.
Note that one does not need to be an official Debian developer to
maintain packages in Debian. Such a formal status is only needed to
upload, so you can go on maintaining this package and work hand in
hand with a Debian developer that will advise you if needed, check
your packages and push it to the Debian archive (... => Ubuntu

Although this seems to be working for authenticating the NTP server,

I've just had a look, by attempting to implement the same in Tails
(i.e. query first the Tor resolver, and fallback to ttdnsd in case the
former is not able to answer the query) as we planned to do for quite
some time. I've seen the same results as you have, using the DNS
frontend caching proxy Tails already ships (pdnsd) instead of unbound.
A few dig commands learned me that the Tor resolver sends an empty
reply (status: NOERROR, QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0) rather than an error when
it does not support the type of the query (e.g. MX). The obvious
consequence of it is: the caching frontend DNS proxy (be it unbound,
pdnsd or whatever) has thus no way to know it should fallback to
ttdnsd in such a case, and it actually never does so, which confirms
what you've observed in the first place.
=> In the current state of the Tor DNS resolver, we're forced to use
ttdnsd by default, and only use the Tor resolver for .onion/.exit...
unless I missed something.
So I'm curious what the rationale for the "empty reply" behavior is.
Any ideas?

Preamble: I'm still not convinced the benefits of the "Live amnesic
host OS + Tor routing VM + desktop VM" approach are worth the energy
we would need to move Tails to this model, but I do find it
interesting to go on a bit with the thought experiment, and to explore
the limits of this idea.
Maxim Kammerer wrote (26 Mar 2012 16:12:41 GMT) :
In my experience, a 7 year old laptop with no VT extensions runs quite
comfortably a full Debian desktop inside a VirtualBox virtual machine.
Obviously, you don't get the entire power of your bare metal CPU, but
you don't lose that much either, and I would certainly don't feel the
end result to be anything like "extremely slow". On the other hand, my
experience with QEMU clearly matches the "extremely slow" results.
Maybe your conclusions on VM speed are simply too tightly bound
to QEMU?
In the scenario this thread is about, I don't think it's that hard to
find a way of splitting the memory that allows the user to perform
their task, without being all too wasteful:
  * the host system's memory needs are not likely to vary much,
    are they?
  * the Tor routing VM memory needs are not likely to vary much,
    either
  * the Desktop VM gets what's left
Obviously, this gets much harder for applications VM.
These abstractions are probably the only reason why I think this
approach would somehow make sense for Tails needs (even if I don't
know if we will go this way in the end).
This is hardly a technical question. It's obvious to me how the way
you ask it, and the way I am answering, say much about how Tails and
Libert? Linux differ in their approach of non-technical matters, in
the ways we think our relationship to users. Let's catch this
opportunity to explain my take on this a bit, and hopefully understand
each other better. Note that I don't care about convincing anyone
here :)
So, why would it make sense to pre-configure, for everyone, the
technical tools that get these abstractions up and running?
Because Tails is about building a common pre-configured system that
tries to address certain common needs, for anyone who happens to share
these needs.
  (We certainly value user {self-,}education very much, as I think the
  recent efforts put into reorganizing and writing Tails documentation
  clearly displays: learning some amount of technical stuff is a must
  to make ones own security decisions properly. But I absolutely don't
  think that "learning how to choose, install and configure
  virtualization software, and how to setup a Tails or Libert? VM in
  there" belongs to the kind of knowledge that empowers people to make
  their own security decisions properly. I'd rather see Tails users
  learn things more useful than this.)
Because, while people can run Tails in a VM by themselves already,
doing this certainly does not give them the same benefits as an
integrated, pre-configured "Live amnesic host OS + Tor routing VM +
desktop VM" Tails would:
  * In the first case, they have to trust _their host system_ to not
    steal information, and to not leak anything to disk, willingly
    or not.
  * In the second case, they don't need to setup and configure that
    host system, because we do.

  * Liferea RSS feed reader
  * Gobby
Then you have a few command-line ones such as wget. Also, some
software that is not SOCKS aware, such as APT, goes through Polipo (to
be replaced with Privoxy, some day).
Basically, that's it.
Note, however, that Tails users may choose to install whatever they
want from the Debian archive, or hand-compile whatever they feel like,
but I doubt the ones who will do so, and unfortunately pick
applications that don't play well with IsolateDestAddr, will be that
many to make a measurable difference.

... and thank you for going on with it!
Jake asked me to have another look at tlsdate, which was uploaded to
Debian, so here it goes :)
(It's pretty clear I lack much of the background and intended usecase,
so please correct whatever is wrong in what follows!)
So, Jake tells me that ChromeOS will use tlsdate by default, and that
this should solve the fingerprinting issue. Therefore, I assume this
implicitly answer the (half-rhetorical, I admit) question I asked in
March, and I assume there is indeed some fingerprinting issue. So, in
the following I'll assume it's relatively easy, for a close network
adversary (say, my ISP) to detect that I'm using tlsdate.
I assume the intended usecase for Tails is to run tlsdate in the clear
(that is, without going through Tor) so that the clock is set before
Tor is started.
If so, from the PoV of a close network adversary, if Tails starts to
use tlsdate in the clear, as a Tails user, then I'm part of the set of
people who run tlsdate and start Tor soon after, and in the current
state of things, this set would almost exactly match the set of
Tails users.
The fact that ChromeOS uses tlsdate forces this kind of adversaries to
detect "tlsdate followed by Tor", instead of merely detecting tlsdate
alone, in order to detect Tails users. (Looks like we have to convince
Google to run Tor by default on ChromeOS? :)
Therefore, I'm not convinced tlsdate in the clear would be any better,
on the fingerprinting side of things, than the "htpdate in the clear"
system we eventually managed to escape in Tails 0.9 and later.
Which means it looks quite worse, fingerprinting-wise, than what we
currently ship.
(Seriously, please prove me wrong, my life would be easier as
a result :)

There are a few pieces of software called htpdate, and the one Tails
uses only connects to HTTPS servers, and delegates to wget the X.509
certificates validation:
In addition, the pal/foe/neutral pool system Tails uses gives *some*
protection against untrustworthy sources of time information, which
limits what one can do with only a few illegitimate X.509 certificates
they got from a "trusted" CA:
Thanks a lot for your detailed answer!

On the Tails side, we have decided to wait a bit for the dust to
settle, and for our upstreams (Linux, Debian, Debian Live) to support
embedded and ARM platforms better, before we even try supporting this
kind of hardware.
Our efforts (or lack thereof, right now) in that field can be followed

This is correct.
This means we implicitly decided it was more important to ask parties
that are unlikely to cooperate to send fake time information to Tails
users, than it would be to entirely avoid asking servers who generally
don't care about privacy. In general, for such matters, I'd rather
rely on diversity, rather than on a set of "trusted" peers.
IIRC: speed, and simplicity ("good enough" is good enough).
If that's not good enough, I'm happy to take a patch :)

I'm not sure I understand correctly what you mean,

our tools. (I'd be glad to see our tools improved to support this
usecase, though :)
My point here is that I absolutely do not want to see a new class of
users, locked in a non-upgradable, obsolete and buggy installation,
coming up on our support channels, because someone gave them something
called Tails, that did not really work like the real thing.
So please:
  * Either make sure you give the Pirate Linux users a working and
    documented way to upgrade the Tails you are distributing to new
    versions we put out. Relying on "should work" feels inadequate to
    me. Best would be to make it so the standard, documented way
    somehow works for Pirate Linux users too, I guess, so that you
    don't have to fork the Tails documentation, the Tails upgrade
    notification system, and possibly more. It may boil down to
    contributing the changes you need to Tails, instead of having to
    slowly fork it.
  * Or, make it crystal clear to Pirate Linux users the version of
    Tails shipped with it "is meant to easily allow people to try
    Tails", and that it may be obsolete, may contain security issues
    fixed in Tails since then, and may be broken in various random
    ways. This clearly is the cheapest way to do it. In that case,
    perhaps synchronizing somehow with our release dates could be
    worth it, to avoid putting a new Pirate Linux out two weeks before
    the scheduled release of a Tails major version?

I doubt we can blend in this "anonymity" set, though: unless Tails
wants to forever copy the set of hosts ChromeOS queries (which I don't
think we would want to rely upon on the long run), then Tails' use of
tlsdate will probably be fingerprintable at least by the ISP if the
connections are made in the clear, so we probably would want to run
tlsdate over Tor anyway.
So, I'm now considering this (tlsdate over Tor) to replace our use of
htpdate, and not to replace our initial time guess based on the Tor
consensus [1].
[1] Jacob, are you interested in implementing something like our current
multiple pool -based approach [2], or something else with similar
security properties? If Tails wants to move to tlsdate some day,
I guess a prerequisite would be not to lose the nice security
properties this approach currently gives us.

Personally, I have to say I absolutely do not regret this.
I've no idea what misconceptions about Tails and Debian make you think
this, but this is incorrect in practice.
First, I fail to see what compiling binaries yourself buys you, in
terms of your level of dependency on "upstream distro's features
implementation cycle".
But anyway, let's debunk this myth before it propagates any further.
Most of the time, what prevents us from diverging from our various
upstreams (Debian, Tor, Torbrowser to name a few) are design decisions
and personal taste, and have nothing to do with basing our stuff on
a binary distro:
  * It was decided early in Tails development to treat long-term
    maintenance as a very important criterion -- and generally, the
    smaller the delta we have to carry ourselves, the easier
    the maintenance.
  * We quite like to share tools, have them used by more people rather
    than just Tails users, maintain them with other people and not on
    our own. We quite dislike inventing wheels that only fit on the
    Tails car.
All this is no news, should be quite easy to get when reading a bit
about Tails development, and has been documented for a while on our
"Relationship with upstreams" page:
So, yes, e.g. having UEFI support added to Debian Live makes sense to
me, as opposed to implementing in a Tails-only way and maintaining it
forever. Sure, it sometimes means we get the feature a bit later
(which is not that clear in this specific case).
If you intend to go on writing such bold public statements about
Tails, then I'd rather give you first-hand information that you can
base your affirmations on. Here we go, then. My experience absolutely
does not match your assumption. I'm personally quite happy with how
I've been learning new things when implementing features for Tails, be
it when writing Tails-specific software, or when implementing the
feature upstream, or when working to make Debian an awesome platform
to build the next Tails generation upon.
Historians could probably build long lists of such things that could
be said about Tails, but life's too short for me to do this work :)

It seems that you are misinformed, and therefore incorrectly pointing
foreign causes for "things don't happen the way we want", while they
don't happen... simply because nobody makes them happen.
Sure, "upstream first" would likely be Debian's answer if the
Torbrowser patches were designed in a way that they only affect the
browser behaviour if some opt-in setting is enabled, and if someone
asked for these patches to be applied to Iceweasel. AFAIK these
patches are not designed this way, which easily explains why nobody
ever asked the Iceweasel maintainers to apply them. So, in the current
state of things, this policy of Debian's is simply not applicable, and
irrelevant as far as the Torbrowser is concerned.
As was explained already on this list (last time by Lunar a few months
ago IIRC), the only reasonable way to get Torbrowser in Debian is to
make it possible to install it in parallel with Iceweasel. The major
blocker right now is the lack of someone to actually do the needed
work, not this or that policy: policy matters were sorted out, and
agreed upon with the relevant Debian teams already.
Finding someone with the right set of skills and enough free time to
actually do this work would be a great way to help. Interested?
The situation may be different on the Thunderbird / Icedove
side, though :)
Hoping it helped clarifying what the real blockers are,

It's not about being *interested* (which is purely about feelings).
It's about taking responsibility to maintain patches outside of the

effectively committing to do more work).
For the record, I was not suggesting you would do this work yourself:
my "Interested?" was about the *finding someone* part :)
I'm curious what policy you're talking about.
(I've taken the liberty to ignore the part about people "blindly"
doing things, assuming you were neither referring to something that
happened for real, nor meaning to be offensive to actual people.)
If flexibility is the bottleneck, and manpower is not, I'm more than
happy! Then, please enlighten me: how could Debian, as an
organization, be more flexible on the Torbrowser topic, in a way that
doesn't imply additional work for current Debian contributors?
Since we're moving out of the tor-talk topic into "learning how Debian
works", perhaps this should be taken off-list at some point...

@_subject: [tor-talk] USB Sticks for TAILS 
(Adding Tails folks into the loop; the thing is not called TAILS more
than Tor is called TOR, by the way :)
I thought I would just drop some notes so that anyone interested is
aware of issues that shall be taken into account ( below) and solved
on the long term ( below) when considering mass-duplication of Tails
USB sticks.
1. There is currently no way to verify the integrity and authenticity
   of a pre-installed Tails, and I don't think it will get any better
   in the future: in my understanding of the chicken'n'egg theory,
   there is no easier way to bootstrap a trust path to a pre-installed
   Tails thumb drive, than to bootstrap a trust path to a downloaded
   ISO image. If we wrote software that allows one to verify a Tails
   thumb drive from another, running and trusted Tails system, then
   the usecase we're adressing could as well be solved by just cloning
   the trusted one to the other thumb drive, right? I still see how it
   could be useful to write such a piece of software, but I'm unsure
   the energy needed is worth it, once the most obvious potential
   usecase has been debunked.
2. It will be hard to scale mass-duplication of pre-installed Tails
   USB sticks once we have thrown some new spicy security improvements
   into Tails-users land. The easiest way we've found to give the
   persistent volume some plausible deniability properties is to
   create it by default at installation time
   ( The need behind this
   technical solution is often expressed to us, and we want to satisfy
   it. For this to add any security, every created persistent volume
   must have different key material. In this context:
     * Selling handmade Tails works fine, and could be scripted with
       a carefully crafted liveusb-creator command-line run in a loop.
     * The only ways I can think of to have this scale beyond 100%
       handmade installation feel kludgy, and it may not be trivial to
       ensure the result still offers plausible deniability (I'm
       thinking of using a USB duplicator, and then post-process the
       cloned thumb drives to replace the encrypted key, in the used
       LUKS slot, with other random data).
Still, as far as 30C3 is concerned, it's totally fine to bring
a hundred pre-installed Tails 0.22 sticks, and I'm very happy you are
planning to do so ? please just make sure they're installed in
a supported, compatible with the persistence feature, way :)

This seams to mean that a corrupted UEFI firmware would modify a Tails
device plugged in the machine to infect it. To me it looks like it's
part of "Tails can't protect against compromised hardware", modulo
nitpicking wrt. whether firmware is software (which is correct
strictly speaking), or a mere part of the computer hardware (which is
also correct, from the PoV of a Tails system, as it's pre-existing to
Tails starting). We have WIP to clarify our documentation in
this respect.
Seems to be the same, but from a running and already infected
non-Tails OS, when a Tails USB stick is plugged in it. That's more
concerning. We should check if we're communicating clearly enough
 * the OS used to install or upgrade a Tails device can corrupt it
 * plugging one's Tails device in an untrusted OS is dangerous
This seems to mean an running Tails infecting its boot device.
Totally unclear if they had any remote idea of how to implement that,
back then. Not much we can do about it that is not on our hardening
milestone already, I guess.

I agree.
I think I see what you mean, and indeed it's the kind of things about
which my self-confidence is pretty low, and I'd personally rather
avoid fiddling with things I don't understand.
But the thing is: by using random guards every time Tails starts, we
are _already_ making the very same kind of decisions. Only, we are
making it very badly, and this has been going on for too many years
Let's face it: as distro integrators, in the current state of things,
we have to make a decision to compensate for the fact that Tor's guard
selection wasn't designed with our threat model in mind.
Keeping things as-is would be a decision. Using fully persistent entry
guards (not location aware), like Tor Browser users get currently,
would be another decision. We cannot escape it, so we're trying to
make this decision in a way that's much better for the vast majority
of Tails users.
With my (lazy by design) distro integrator's hat, I can only agree:
the more work is done by little-t-tor, the less I have to deal with
myself, and the more is shared cross-distro. Yay.
However, taking a step back, I'm not sure it makes a whole lot of
sense: to be location-aware, tor would have to gain knowledge about
new concepts, and interface with OS services, that it can currently
happily ignore so far; add to this that tor is multi-platform;
I expect it's not an easy problem to deal with at this specific place,
but again: if someone solves it, I certainly won't complain :)
Right, I think it's important that people who what more control can
get it this way, and IIRC our current best proposal does not prevent
anyone from doing this.
If the configuration GUI has good facilities to document a broad and
complex problem, yay, bringing the doc closer to the software is
probably a winning strategy.
I have no time/energy to think seriouly about it now, and I've been
postponing my reply for a month due to this, so I'll try to be
pragmatic: I'm adding this as a FIXME on our blueprint, and will come
back to it later.
I'm not sure I understand the problem you mean to raise, though.
Can you please elaborate what problem you see if users do exactly this

Not sure I understood what you mean with "fed back" here.
IMO merely exposing this info to the user in more places brings little
value, if any. If we find a good way to give the user some meaningful
control over it, it's different of course.

I don't understand why we would pick Entry Guard A in the last step on
day 2, can you please explain?
Fully agreed!
Right, it's something we want to limit. anonym and I have been working
a bit more on it, and have reverted the addition of the ESSID in the
data we hash, found another attack, thought a bit about potential
defenses, and discussed it a bit more. See the "First iteration"
section on our blueprint for details:
In the current state of things we're undecided whether our current
design is good enough to be worth shipping, or not. We'll probably ask
someone (probably Isis) for help evaluating it and/or designing
something better.

This can be interpreted in a number of ways, including some that
I personally find problematic. But maybe you want to rephrase so
I understand better what you meant?

Hi shirish!
shirish शिरीष:
Given the path where your Tor Browser is installed, it looks like
you're using torbrowser-launcher.
If you're using the torbrowser-launcher Debian package, then please
report a bug against it. And if you're using the upstream
torbrowser-launcher, then its bug tracker lives there:

Rob van der Hoeven:
If I wanted to find another type of applications that AORTA does not
manage to torify, I would look for programs whose main executable
merely triggers startup of the main program via D-Bus activation (e.g.
those started with gapplication).

There's Onion Circuits that we ship in Tails and Debian:
That's not supported by Onion Circuits.

tor user:
Onion Circuits was developed primarily with Tails in mind,
and since Tails routes all Internet traffic through Tor,
the network bandwidth graph provided by GNOME System Monitor
was deemed sufficient.
Now, I guess we would not reject a a good UX/GUI design + branch that
adds bandwidth graphs.
I'm afraid the best doc we have for this is the source code:
        connect_args = dict()
        if 'TOR_CONTROL_SOCKET' in os.environ:
            connect_args['control_socket'] = os.environ.get('TOR_CONTROL_SOCKET')
        if 'TOR_CONTROL_ADDRESS' in os.environ or \
           'TOR_CONTROL_PORT' in os.environ:
            connect_args['control_port'] = (
                os.environ.get('TOR_CONTROL_ADDRESS', '127.0.0.1'),
                int(os.environ.get('TOR_CONTROL_PORT', 9051))
            )
        self.controller = stem.connection.connect(**connect_args)
