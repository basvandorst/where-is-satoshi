Hi! I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Akron in Akron,
OH. I am an Honors student and am very interested in doing research on TOR
for my senior honors research project. I was looking at the volunteer page
under research and found the end-to-end traffic confirmation attack topic
interesting. Would anyone be able to point me to some more resources that
would help me with carrying out this research? Or let me know where I
should begin reading?
Or, as I am not an expert in the field, if there were any topics that you
think might be better-suited for an undergraduate, let me know.
Thank You
