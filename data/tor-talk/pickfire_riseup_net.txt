I hope that there is also a way to use tor with freenode other than
I wanted to use tor with freenode and oftc in pidgin. And it seems that
the method "really hope that the exit I have isn't blocked" have a very,
very low probability. (about 10%)
I still haven't figured out how to use SSL in freenode and oftc.

Tor doesn't have a lot of commands, most of the time you don't even need
to edit the configurations. Take a look at `man tor` on how to configure
Tor. Look at /etc/tor/torrc and you will see now nice the configurations
are commented out.

Hi, I am running Tor on raspberry pi but I am not currently running any
relay, my internet speed is only 500KiB/s. I am not sure if I can run a
relay. Even Nurmi's speed is faster than mine.
That's what I get from the Tor's FAQ to run a relay.

Nope, the download can happen outside Tor network. You are using Tor
browser which depend on Tor, not Tor itself.
Just set the proxy environment and you can use Tor for all the

Is there any reason for the ShutdownWaitLength to be 30s? That's too
long, no wonder it is so slow to restart the tor service.

Hi, nice to see one of the facebook developers here.
I have been using ` with
[surf]( for some time now. I didn't notice any
issue with it, I can say it is loading faster than some times and vice versa.

It might be true, I set up a .onion domain some time ago.
And it might be the other way round, people might be setting up fake

@_subject: [tor-talk] A multi-layer proof of work system to solve the 
Nice speech, I don't use Tor browser, I use Tor for almost every
application. I would like to automate a link checker for it, but the
useless Cloudflare broke my script to check broken links.
I do that too, I use Tor for news reader, email client, lightweight
browser, almost everything use Tor, I just don't use transparent
torification for it, I considered it problematic.
There is a work to get around that, I plan to do an application to solve
those captcha either by using audio captcha or the picture, there is
actually some ways to solve, I just haven't got the idea yet. (Note:
Those captcha is solve-able by machine not human, it is too hard)
I have no comment for Javascript, Tor browser disable that by default,
but I use javascript most of the time.
They can actually not use Tor and instead use botnets, botnets is better
and a lot faster than Tor.

Yeah, recently there are problem with recaptcha, it need to take me a

No, it doesn't, but you can solve those non-javascript captcha easier.
No, there is an html version which is easier that uses a POST method.
I heard that it is easier to create a script that breaks the audio
captcha compare to the visual captcha.
CAPTCHA isn't a good one.

Yup, I did that too. If I want to view a new site with cloudflare, I try
to solve it, but when I do get bored (2 or 3 try depending on the site),
I will just exit.
Nice, I will do that.
