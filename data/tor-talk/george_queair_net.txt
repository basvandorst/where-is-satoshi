Great stuff Olaf.
Some questions:
I'm aware of the "Last Published Descriptor (GMT)" field, but why is
there such a consistent gap in "observed bandwidth" between Blutmagie
and Rueckgr.at, which is the only other operational TorStatus I'm aware
of?  Is this a question for the Rueckgr.at admin?
Is there another way to check observed bandwidth? Atlas. seems to only
look at advertised bandwidth.

Here's the official announce:
TDP Announce for Tor Browser 5.5 for OpenBSD
The Tor BSD Diversity Project
The Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP) is proud to announce the release of
Tor Browser (TB) version 5.5 for OpenBSD. Please note that this version
of TB remains in development mode, and is not meant to ensure strong
privacy, anonymity or security.
TDP ( is an effort to extend the use of the BSD
Unixes into the Tor ecosystem, from the desktop to the network.
The 5.5 version is the eighth Tor Browser release from TDP.
To install TB for OpenBSD, please see
TDP is focused on diversifying the Tor network, with TB being the
flagship project. Additional efforts are made to increase the number of
*BSD relays on the Tor network among other sub-projects.
TDP's source code repository resides at TDP is seeking funding to continue and extend its efforts. Please

The Tor BSD Diversity Project ( has done some
substantial overhauling of TB for OpenBSD in the past week, with a bunch
of releases aimed at refining the port.
We are still at version 5.5 and are in development mode, but we'll be
working on 5.5.2 in the near future. We are fully aware of the
vulnerabilities in version 5.5 and 5.5.1.
Getting TB into the OpenBSD ports would be an enormously important step.
OpenBSD maintains fanatical and refreshing attention to clean, correct
code. For instance, OpenBSD project forked OpenSSL in 2014 with LibreSSL
(.org), which is a tighter, more secure implementation that is fully

A short list of recent changes includes:
* the creation of i386 TB packages
* elimination of unnecessary packaging in favor of native Mozilla
mechanisms wherever possible
* reworking of run-dependencies and the addition of a meta port to aid
in installation
* reworking of the Firefox addon .xpi packaging to be kinder to the
filesystem (torbutton, tor-launcher, noscript, https-everywhere)
We are getting very useful feedback from the main OpenBSD developer who
is focused on Mozilla porting.

There is currently an OpenBSD ports tree freeze, so it doesn't look like
we can make it for the 5.9 stable release cycle. Ports tree freezes
happen before the 6 months release cycle. Outside of important security
fixes, there's really no chance for new ports to get added.
However, we're pretty optimistic that TB will get into the OpenBSD ports
tree sooner than later. It's been a lot of work since the OpenBSD
project is very strict about new ports, particularly ones which are even
vaguely connected to preexisting ones, such as
Firefox-extended-service-release, which TB is based on.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Escape NSA just to enter commercial surveillance? 
Markus Hitter:
I understand the sentiment, but I think there's another angle.
People in the privacy/anonymity space tend to want to project hard
guidelines for users.
In reality, it's the users themselves who need to be making the choice,
so enhancing what they are using is a positive.
Let me give you a cold, hard example someone conveyed to me a long time
ago, in a context where it meant something:
"you tell me not to use Facebook so I can't be tracked?  What if my
Facebook post can save 100 people's lives?"
Users need to be the ones to weigh the stakes, etc.  It's not our job to
lay down the rules or doctrines.
Moreover, if Facebook, etc, decide to employ hidden services, it is good
publicity against the "hidden services are for terrorists and other
evil-doers" meme.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Escape NSA just to enter commercial surveillance? 
Yes, often people bypassing censorship and surveillance have legitimate
reasons to access Facebook as a tool for organizing.  For every user
opting for the more privacy-oriented tools, there's probably tens of
thousands who stick with tools like Facebook and Twitter.
That is an unfortunate reality.
1. the dozens of PETs-oriented web 2.0/social networking projects have
gained little or no traction among significant populations.  The reality
is that most people still opt for the mainstream services/applications
despite their weaknesses in regards to privacy, security, anonymity,
etc.  People in our scene should start recognizing that, and not dismiss
those users out-of-hand.
2. It's also very apparent that those services tend to accept direction
in terms of geo-political interests.  It's not just about McDonalds and
McDonnell Douglas, but also about the Facebooks and Googles.
I strongly think our role is about enhancing the privacy associated with
those services on multiple levels, plus about providing a methodology
for users to understand the pluses and minuses, and letting them make
decisions based on their circumstances and needs.  To quote the old Syms
store slogan, "an educated consumer is our best customer."
Keeping both feet in the reality of those users needs to be the starting
point, or you become irrelevant to their circumstances and your warnings
and cries go into the abyss.

The operating system diversity argument is most often focused on the
issue of relays and the overwhelming Linux monoculture there.
And while I don't touch Windows with any frequency and am not a fan of
so much of the Microsoft approach, I think the notion (not from the
original poster) that Windows users aren't relevant to a healthy Tor
ecosystem is dangerous.
The reality of anonymity is that quantity and accessibility, not just
diversity, are vital. And since the fact is that most desktop users
(discounting smart phones) are Windows users, I hardly think we can
build a large, dispersed universe of anonymity-seeking users with the
Linux desktop as the central vehicle. And Microsoft and its allies
aren't necessarily the most immediate and conscious adversaries to all
Ordinary users who don't use Linux (or other perceived "acceptable" OSs)
are a vital component in the Tor network IMHO. Sure, open source is
vital, but reality is much uglier.
And let's be honest, a good portion of Linux desktop users are running
Ubuntu, which had its own "call back to the mothership" issues
( eg).
In terms of workplace hardware, there are plenty of places where outside
devices are not welcomed.. although your smart phone is most likely a
workable alternative.

While we are personally bare-metal advocates, we understand that for a
variety of reasons VPS-type systems provide a low-barrier of entry to
run a Tor relay for many. VPS providers also ease the ability for extend
geographical diversity.
Over the past several months we accumulated a list of BSD VPS/shell/etc
providers, and are looking to populate further.
The current list mostly contains providers that offer English-language
web sites, but that will change soon as among the three of us we cover a
good number of other languages.
Ultimately, this list might be added/updated with the (misnamed?)
GoodBadISPs list
While certainly *any* VPS-type provider that allows the Tor server to
run is worth more investigation, we are specifically looking at those
that provide some sort of BSD Unix support only. I think the Tor Project
would be happy with more contributions to the trac list.
On that note, any additions or comments can be directed to me offlist,
or via GitHub.
In the near future, we can post to Tor-Talk the email text we are
sending to providers which others might find useful for related purposes.

Jason Long:
You can't ensure that none of the Tor nodes in a particular three-node
circuit aren't run by some three-letter government agency.
There are regular checks about expired versions of Tor, poorly
configured Tor policies on nodes, or other explicit bad things, but
those only catch the most obvious insecurities.
You can run your own relay or bridge, which could at least ensure one
hop isn't compromised, not to mention the benefit for the many other Tor
But ultimately, Tor's topography mitigates against one of the three
nodes in your circuit being compromised. If the first hop is
compromised, then they only know who you are, but not where your
destination is. If the last hop is compromised, they only know where
you're going, but not who you are (unless your providing clear text of
personally identifying information).
This happens to be why that quiet individual who runs one bridge or
relay is so vital to the integrity of the network.

I thought it might be interesting for others to hear some of the
questions that arose in the discussion at the NYC Tor event on Feb 15
this past week.
This list isn't exhaustive, but it may connect with others on this list,
and could possibly provide more materials for the Tor Project FAQ
( I didn't attempt to
provide details on the answers and I did miss a part of the discussion,
although I provide some comments. Any inaccuracies/commentary are
attributable to me and me alone.
* Why is Tor {weak|underutilized} *there*?/What causes the waves and
troughs in Tor usage in a particular country?
This question arose in the context of certain countries which see
significant jumps then declines in usage. The well-known cases of usage
spikes is usually tied to political turbulence in a particular country,
in which internet censorship becomes a tactic of repression. But in
other cases, there might be the adoption of "real identity" tied to
online accounts, or blocking of specific messaging applications.
* Why do Akamai/CloudFlare and other man-in-the-middle type services
block Tor?
There have been changes in the CloudFlare configuration where the "block
Tor knob" is off by default. Blocking Tor isn't just based on the FUD of
"Tor users are all bad" but often it's recognized as a tool of
commercial competition.  For instance, firm's might be concerned about
comment spam or derisive comments from a competitor.
* Do *they* know if I download TAILS/Tor Browser?
*They* in this case could be any wide-seeing adversary, which could be
your ISP, corporate management or one three-letter government agency or
This is a common question in my experiences. But despite fumbling
through an array of answers, Roger offered an elegant answer with: Are
you more concerned about the adversary seeing you downloaded TAILS, or
them seeing the www sites you visit?
* .onion sites
There was some discussion about perceptions about and use of .onion
services, and why we say ".onion" as opposed to the hidden web/"Dark
While many (particularly in the media) refer to the frequency of the
"ugly" residing on .onion services, Facebook is actually the most
visited site.  Some month in the past, some 1 million users accessed the
.onion site, which represented 1/16 of that month's Facebook users. That
may point to the future trajectory of .onion sites. Just because in
absolute terms there's lots of loopy www sites there, they aren't
representative of the full-scope of .onion traffic in relative terms.
* Tor and The End of Net Neutrality: What Impact?
The bluntly honest answer was "who knows?" since each state seems to be
countering federal legislation. And as an overlay network, Tor users
might actually be a useful too to mitigate legislation.
* Running an Exit Node
Much of the discussion is directly addressed by Tor documentation, but I
can imagine that a meeting specifically on the topic may be relevant in
the future, at least in a place where there is a significant
concentration of non-exit relay operators wanting to take the plunge.
The discussion prompted a lot of other relevant questions and comments,
but that's a quick survey of some I thought that were interesting.

Jumping in late to the party... specifically from BSD-land.
Keep in mind "stripped-down" is an individual's perspective. I think
OpenBSD is very tight, and the kernel is rumored to shrink on occasion
with releases. Yet by default, OpenBSD contains an httpd and smtp
server, fvwm for X and other things one might consider "bloat."
Live CDs aren't mainstream like they were ten or more years ago.
Specifically with FreeBSD, you had FreeBSD tools like Freesbie alive and
active. It's still in FreeBSD ports in sysutils, but I haven't used in a
long time. NanoBSD is another simple build system for RAM-based systems,
but I think most of the activity is/was around pfSense (which
discontinued using it, I think) and for arm platform builds.
Specifically look at Crochet for FreeBSD as another option.
It seems most full system on USB/CD media systems are EOL'd at this point.
It remains a relatively do-able task for any OS. Install to the media as
a target, boot off it and configure as you desire. If you want something
easier to maintain longer-term on OpenBSD, you might look at vnd(4) and
vndconfig(8) manual pages.
The issue remains there are so many different needs and preferences in
such systems, a simple third-party download that is one-size-fits-all is
unlikely. You'll notice that with systems that contains X managers,
where it's all XFCE, or KDE, or whatever. A creators view of the ideal
set of utilities and packages rarely matches that of more than a few users.
If it's really something you want, you should probably do it yourself.
We ( have weighed doing some sort of TAILS-like
system for OpenBSD, but it's not in the cards in the near term. On that
note, you might look at our wiki at  for more
relevant information.

Chelsea Komlo:
Yes.  This thread is completely inappropriate for Tor Project mailing lists.
This is an irrelevant conversation among a few people with many thousands more silently getting frustrated.
Expect some unexplained bans and mod flags set.

@_subject: [tor-talk] One Less Site Blocking Tor (Browser) 
Besides being a great story, it does push some of us who just accept
things the way they are.
More often than not with smaller www sites, I'd assume it's a
click-click-click configuration in some www admin interface that blocks
Tor user access by default.
Do we have any templated message to send to sites that block Tor IPs?  A
quick internet search says we don't.
Is that something you'd want to hack away at Drew? You're already
batting 1.000 on this from my box scores...
