there is preparation draft work done to get the vidalia Qt plugin out for
the TorBrowser based on Dooble Web Browser 1.35 with lots of security
Is there something to change on the drafted website?
Can the Tor Onion be shown in the First Feature Box?
Thanks Regards

the domain exists for years, it has been acquired for the Qt update, see
the given 2010 release with still firefox.
As there it TBB, Tor Browser Bundle, the TorBrowser should not affect this.
It has been there for years, why should the domain be now a spot to look
at? there could be a link to the changelog of the browser for the support
of evidence of security, next to the features list.
The Website is CC and so remixable, there is no need to use another
Tor URL and Project has been linked. So there is nothing that is creating
doubt, the opposite is to assume, that the high quality standard for this
website is overtaken, it is a good template.

Hi Georg,
the browser has improved a lot and what you mention, is webkit related, if
I remember right.
So does Tor inform all users for all the Webkit Browser?
Let?s research on that more to find a risk analysis.

1. Dooble uses Qt's proxy implementations. QFtp is not used. IP address
retrieval (feature to show the IP of the website, shown in the title of the
website) does not yet use proxies. The mechanism may be disabled by the
user and so should the vidalia plugin of Torbrowser.
2. User agent strings require isolation. JavaScript may also require some
isolation. Dooble doesn't query other browsers nor does it share
information with other browsers. Odd requirement.
3. Data that is written to disk is written in an encrypted manner.
Temporary sessions utilize temporary passwords. Authenticated sessions
destroy data that's associated with temporary sessions.
4. User data is written in an encrypted manner. User settings are stored in
human readable forms.
Complete risk isolation is not practical. That is, an entity with escalated
privileges and special knowledge could potentially gain insight into the
user's current state if access to the network and/or machine was available.
But that is given for any Browser and any machine or network. User need to
minimize the access to their machines, but in case, Dooble saves no data to
the disk, and if the user enables to write data to the disk, this is always
done in an encrypted manner since version 1.35.

As you already can see on the website, it is added (maybe done later than
you looked first):
"TorBrowser Source code is open source and not affiliated with Tor, but
simply use Tor. "Tor" and the "Onion Logo" are registered trademarks of the
Tor Project, Inc. Content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons
Attribution 3.0 License, unless otherwise noted."
this should remove any confusion.
do we agree to this? not affiliated means independently. As tor is used,
tor should be working as needed.
"Guarantee from the Tor Project" should then be the same, you might mean
"Guarantee from the TBB",  but see above: it is clear that it is not an
offical bundle, but might become one, as you write: empirical existence and
development will show later.
In case you cannot live with "not affiliated, just simply uses Tor" and it
is still creating confusion, we can adjust that even more.

since 2 years there has been no idea about this and we just changed the

If you look in the web, there are many many browsers bundled with tor.
the domain we speak about has been established by a russian coder who
overgave the project to be able to use a new browser.
We created this username for Mike Perry, so he can overtake the login and
use the domain for the TBB, as this name was already taken at sf.net the
Surname for this nic has been changed from Mike to Mikey.
So the offer to use this domain has been officially sent to Tor, but was
neglected as no one wanted to use this domain. So Mikey is not Mike.
So it will be used for an alternative bundle. The login name should be
changed, agreed, to not confuse on this level. But still M.P. is at every
time invited and has already SVN access to think about this bundle too.

On the Homepage is written:
 Can I run GoldBug over Tor or a Proxy?
Of course, that is possible. You can use any proxy of the web or Tor to
connect from your GoldBug to any neighbor or chat server. Due to the fact
that the chat protocol uses HTTP, you should be even able to create a chat
server and listener for GoldBug using a so called TOR hidden service. But
this has not yet been tested and would be a task for the Tor-community to
run the chat and echo over Tor. As well firewalled environments are not a
problem, as long as you are able to do online banking and have an
accessible chat server within your IT-environment/country.
I wounder if anyone can provide a Tor Service with a Listener / E*MPP Chat
Server Setup.
Besides the operational and technical question: regarding the protocols it
is an interesting research, if - as GoldBug seems to use the HTTP protocol,
TOR Exit nodes cold Forward a mesage from outside to the Chat listener
I guess due to the onion address this is only found from tor inside when
adding this info.
What needs to be modified to use the outproxy a router to an .onion address
See. the idea would be to have a GB listener as onion address. then
messengers outside tor choose just an IP from the Exit node list .. what
Needs then to be done to route from the exitnode to the onion address?
Needs the incoming message inclide the onion address or Need the Exit node
know this onion address, if ciphertext Comes in?
Can someone think about this and give an answer? How to address
GB -> Exitnode -> Tor network -> hidden onion address -> Tor Network -> Any
other Exitnode -> in case a GB is connected.. routing back to the GB
does the Message Need the onion address included, or does the Exit node
Need the echo library of GB ?

Dear Matt, Tom?s and Justin,
as you said, that project ideas are welcome, just wanted to make you aware
about the idea of a vidalia plugin for another browser:
this project has been founded by a russian developer in 2010 and last year
some polish developers created the vidalia Qt plugin for a Qt browser.
Currently the plugin seems to be used within some countries, which have not
access to the original tor site. So good to have an alternative. It?s just
a model, which can be evaluated, in case a developer is interested in it.
So nothing really new, but updated last year with the current Qt frame

 designed and maintained alternative to the browser developed by The
 Tor Project.
An alternative to Firefox exists and this is good. The Browser needs not to
be maintained by tor people, as it is independent.
The project by the way is not a browser project, it is a vidalia plugin
project. It provides just a Qt dll. If someone wants to join or wants to go
on, it is the vidalia people as they are the Qt plugin developing, which
has been used as code.
this has been discussed one year ago on the lists and a disclaimer is
mentioned and was suggested.
If something other or more needs to be considered, please announce it from
the offcial persons.
Otherwise we found a good solution as requested.
 and the level of anonymity it provides is dubious.
This is nonsense as all the items of security can be explained and are
given due to modern standards.
See Firefox not soving the problem, which the new browser currently solves
(as one of the only browsers)
"According to  and  it's
possible to dump lots of garbage onto a user's hard drive by some HTML5
mechanism. Dooble 1.40 does not suffer from this attack. Please enable your
plugins and visit filldisk.com."
So why do you suggest Firefox with this bug? as wellt he cookie bug
especially in reagard for Tor is dangerous.
I see it the opposite way: Stop using Firefox as TBB and we would not have
any problems, if the the Alternative Bundle is made the offical one. Thanks.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
GoldBug - Secure Instant Messenger / V 0.6.2088 released.
Encryption Model: (SSL ->  (AES -> (RSA -> (Message))))
GoldBug is a secure Instant Messenger. You can be sure with using GoldBug
(GB), that no third party can look into your chat communication. Private
user-to-user communication remains private. GoldBug therefore uses strong
multi-encryption with different layers of modern encryption technologies of
well known and revised crypto libraries (like libgcrypt (GnuPG) and
OpenSSL). The app offers as well decentral and encrypted Email and
decentral public E*IRC-Chat.
GB is a Desktop / Mobile GUI Interface based on libspoton:
New Features and Improvements:
(1) Introduction of ElGamal encryption key pairs (as alternative to
(2) Signature key pairs are extended to a choice of: DSA and RSA.
(3) Added Accounts for chat-servers/neighbors-connections: Create a
dedicated connection on your EMPP-Chat-Server for friends only with a

open it).
(5) Allow neighbors to be defined such that (non-ssl)-plaintext connections
are prohibited (HTTPS-Only-Connections, Default: enabled - For that reason,
please remove neighbors.db. in case you overtake your ".spoton"-datapath).
(6) Introduced threaded peers: Go parallel with your processes!

Anonymity is quite easily broken, if cookies cannot managed (e.g. like

Javascript allows to access the local IP address and files, which host the
local IP address. That`s why Tor and Javascript do not go together.
I miss in FireFox a dedicated cookie management.
Besides these two serious problem there is browser fingerprinting.
Incriminating are the details of a particular browser plugin setup (e.g.
only 1 in 20,830 browsers have an identical plugin load) and the list of
system fonts: 1 in 13,886).

@_subject: [tor-talk] [cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
*Anonymous Email based on virtual institutions*
What about this model? In a network you send your public email encryption
key to an "virtual institution".
The institution is defined by a name (e.g. AES string) and postal address
(e.g. hash key). Having this information added to your node, all your email
to you or from you will be stored in the virtual email provider
institution. This detaches your nodes IP and encrpytion key from the
institution. That means, care-off (c/o) institutions will be able to house
3rd-party e-mail without needing to distribute their own public keys.
To create a post office for your friends, two methods exist:
1) Define a common neighbor (e.g Alice and Bob connect to a common
webserver as node, and all three have email encryption keys shared), then
the webserver stores the emails, even if Alice or Bob are offline.
2) Or/additionally: Create an virtual institution and add the email key of
a friend to your node. In case your friend adds the magnet link (which
contains name and address of the virtual institution, aka AES key and Hash
key) for the institution as well to his node, the institution will save all
emails for him (as well from senders, which are not registered at the
virtual institution).
A Magnet Link allows to share the virtual institution easily. The magnet
Uri would look like:
With this method an email provider can be build without data retention and
with the advantage of detached email encrpytion keys from node?s IP
addresses. Next to TCP, you can use as well UDP and SCTP as protocol.
Virtual Institutions (VI) have been - due to the homepage - introduced by
the lib-version 0.9.04 of  email and chat application.
If we understand this right, now everyone can create an email provider
without data retention just as a service for friends. In case in a network
of connected nodes everyone uses "gmail" as VI-name and "dotcom" as
VI-address, everyone will host everyone for email, while all remains
encrypted..  could be a nice net or p2p model in a testing.

Hi Grarpamp,
the point was that I would not use bleep messenger from bittorrent, as
it is not open source. Others like the one you did a research on might
be worth for further testings, either by the binaries or - you seem to
be keen on to - compile it yourself.  I cannot help you with compile
firefloo messenger on linux or windows, as I have not done this yet.
Why don' t you test the binaries? The source and the binaries might
not be machting from hash, because if you know source projects, the
source might be corrected on one or two files even when the binaries
have been build. So better build the software from source and use your
own binaries. I would suggest to build the crypto core first, which is
spot-on. Regards
1) I guess you use windows.
2a) download the source from either the download files
File: Spot-On.d.tar.gz
2b) or use the SVN url to be current:
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/spot-on/code/ spot-on-code
3) install Qt.io
Use Version 5.3.1
Qt 5.3.2 for Windows 32-bit (MinGW 4.8.2, OpenGL, 737 MB)
configure it correctly
4a) use the comand line app from Qt
and here you use these commands:
qmake -o Makefile spot-on.pro
4b) or use better  the creator app from Qt. this is very convenient,
so I describe this way further:
Load the file "spot-on.win.qt5.pro" with the Creator. It is the .pro
file for the kernel. Under windows it also loads the
spot-on-gui.win.qt5.pro, which is the .pro file for the gui. (Under
linux you might need to pic up both and compile both).
5) click the green forward icon to compile the pro file (for release
and pro-gui), in the Creator. the compile runs and shows the app.
6.) Enter password, generate keys and connect to the project server in
Neighbours tab: tulip.cloud.tilaa.com 4710
7) Ask a friend to do the same or to use the binaries: exchange keys,
and chat. Done. All is encrypted and you never need to exchange keys.
Hope this helps to use Qt. It is very easy.
