@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Network Map 
Hi All,
The TOR Newtork Map was a very informative and attractive tool for explaining TOR to potential users. Now that the TOR bundle and TAILS don't include the network map software anymore what would be an alternative?

Many people use TOR without understanding enough about how it works. They trust TOR because of what they hear about it without their own verification. TOR is just a tool not the solution and you have to know how to use it correctly.

There's enough information available on the internet to gain good knowledge of how to use TOR. Making sure you know the tools you're using is your responsibility.
Looking at porn isn't called illegal, *most* self-contained people should be fine using clearnet.

My friend if you hear whinning someone should 'help' you *read* my post. Also never say something is a fact about all people that need tor for security, anonymity. You appear to be getting of topic here. Please try to relax, there's no problem. Everything is okay.

This isn't a debate and you appear to have a problem with anger. You should deal with that. Your response wasn't edifying. In future replies try to offer something that edifies people instead of hostility. Folly is low energy and makes it hard to be intelligent. That's probably your problem. Who cares about your mistake? Stop whining.
