@_subject: [tor-talk] Any risk by showing traffic statistic on the 
my company decided to start a Tor exit relay recently. We now want to show some statistics on the DirFrontPage which we think people will find interesting.
The statistic will only be basic and already public information such as uptime and open ports, but also how much traffic the relay currently is pushing through.
So I would like to ask if there's a big risk by exposing this (traffic analysis attacks in mind here)?  If this is a bad idea, is there anything we can show on the DirFrontPage about the relays current state without it being a risk?

Hello Paul.
We've now discussed this and we have decided that we want to show some of the public data (uptime, fingerprint, version etc...) and also the amount of traffic the relay has sent through measured in GB. We fetch this data from our libreNMS API.
This set of data will be updated each 5 minutes. Does this sounds safe?
