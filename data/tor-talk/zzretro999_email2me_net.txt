@_subject: Help with JanusVM? 
Hello
anyone have this happen? suddenly I get no more mail from or-talk and any emails I send or post don't go to or-talk nor are they sent back to me as undeliverable?
I had to set up a new account and subscribe again but wonder what happened as I don't know what happened.

Sorry to hear your having troubles with JanusVM and for the lack of information for Linux users.
JanusVM is not a zombie/defunct/dead as I use it quite often with different operating systems, even with my smart phone, and it works just fine.
Let's say JanusVM's settings are:
eth0 (On VMware's bridged interface)
IP: 192.168.1.102
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
eth1 (On VMware's NAT'd or Host-only interface)
IP: 192.168.50.128
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Let's say your PC NIC settings are as follows:
IP: 192.168.1.100
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
DNS: 192.168.1.1
All you have to do is change the Gateway and DNS settings on your PC to:
IP: 192.168.1.100
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.102
DNS: 4.2.2.2
Any other PC on your LAN can do the same using the 192.168.1.102 address as their gateway and set their DNS to an external DNS server.
OR if you want to isolate your PC from the LAN you could use:
IP:  192.168.50.130
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.50.128
DNS: 4.2.2.2
Notice the gateway address is now pointing at JanusVM, and the DNS address is using an IP OUTSIDE YOUR LAN.  The reason you need your DNS to point outside your local LAN is to prevent DNS leaks.  When the DNS server is outside your LAN, the DNS resolve request get's sent to JanusVM where it is redirected to Tor's DNS port.
Expect JanusVM to be updated soon because of the recent security bug found in Tor.  I'm still in holiday mode with family and friends and will update it soon.  The reason you don't see it updated every month is because we use a little software as possible to create it, reducing the amount of updates/patches required to keep it secure.  Generally the only thing that we have to update is Tor.
Happy Holidays,
Few extra bits of info:
JanusVM + vmware-player (on linux) + kvpnc as the intended means of connecting to JanusVM.  What I cannot do is get kvpnc to connect to JanusVM (problems with the Janus certs and/or config - but NO explanations or howtos on setting up the whole thing anywhere!
I don't know what interface produced by JanusVM is the gateway (tun0? vmnet1? vmnet8?).
The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.

 That's great. At the same time many govts allow mobile providers to track users, even by longitude / latitude.  If mobile providers have the technology or are allowed to, so can govts. I sleep better at night just knowing (any) govt has its (& other countries') citizens' best interests at heart. (little sarcasm). A govt's word is as good as gold - they've never lied (from beginning of recorded history), have they? I am a little concerned though, about the US violating the constitution in numerous ways to spy on citizens in numerous ways. (remember the congressional hearings on telephone & internet?) If you want to know what (any) govt's up to, have to go elsewhere & dig deep for news & insight, not depend on info from the govt(s), nightly news or newspapers. Don't ask the fox guarding the hen house how things are. Something is only a conspiracy theory when no facts, evidence (or sometimes even common sense about it) exist. _______________________________________________ don't know if anyone remembers about, oh, I don't know, about 1-3? years ago the U.S. government and U.S. military admitted that the U.S. military had been used to spy domestically on U.S. citizens. That, is specifically prohibited by Federal law, law the Feds break. They, your government, should never be trusted, ever.
It is time to disband the gangs of the government and all American institutions that are broke (they can't be fixed), that don't solve problems (none of them do) and stop using the same ole, broken, impractical and unusable tools we have or have been given or allowed to use, that to this very day, have not, do not and will not fix the problems WE, the people have.
Yet that is the box most willingly stay in, think in, believe in and speak in.
If it doesn't solve the problems we need solved, then it is irrelevant to our lives and needs to be discarded with something that works, in its place. That is usually, people: us/US
Things are always left to us/US to take care of and WE do, so take a look around you and be honest to yourself.
Sorry for the rant but that's all there seems to be. No action being taken in other words, or are 'ya gonna vote! That doesn't work and hasn't for a long time.

Well, you could make this argument for any blocking activity: cookies,
javascript, plugins, ad-blocking, etc. If one user is blocking a bunch
of things, then they stand out because they are blocking things, and
most people aren't. You might even be able to do extensive tests to
find out what sorts of things they are blocking and find some sort of
Take cookies for example. Imagine these scenarios:
1. User blocks all cookies.
2. User blocks all cookies except cookies from whitelisted sites.
3. User accepts all cookies except cookies from blacklisted sites.
4. User accepts all cookies.
Now, as I understand it, your argument is that any deviation from 4,
but especially selective whitelisting/blacklisting as described in 2
and 3, is a variation from the norm and hence makes a user stand out.
(I believe, it would actually either require multiple sites to
collaborate to perform such an attack, or else, as you suggested, the
exit node itself might perform the attack.)
Now, while there are some cookies that do not contain anything unique,
most cookies are used to store unique IDs. So if you accept a cookie
from a site, they are probably going to give you a unique pseudonym
they can use to track you with. On the other hand, if you refuse to
accept cookies from that site, then you are part of the anonymity
group of Tor users who do not accept cookies from that site. Yes, they
could use other techniques to narrow things down, but at least you
haven't let them give you a unique session ID. So, I think the closer
you can get to 1, without sacrificing too much usability, the better.
The more Tor users can be persuaded to do 2, the better. The more Tor
users could at least be persuaded, if not to do that, then to at least
have a blacklist of advertising domains (3), the better. Then you will
stand out less when you refuse to accept a cookie. (In Firefox, you
can use the Cookie Monster plugin to help with this.)
Javascript is even worse. Javascript often has security
vulnerabilities, so an attacker might exploit a buffer overflow or
something, and use that to reveal your identity. Even if the
Javascript is not exploited, it can still reveal a lot of information
about you. For an idea of what I am talking about, take a look at this
site and allow Javascript.
(That will also show you why you shouldn't allow plugins such as Java
or Flash when using Tor unless you have a fancy setup to force them
through Tor, or simply don't care about your anonymity that much, and
even then, they can still reveal a lot.)
Now, even normal, non-exploiting Javascript still reveals much more
specific information about my computer than simply "This user does not
permit Javascript from your website". So again, the more Javascript
you block, the better. The more Tor users can be persuaded to only
allow Javascript from specific websites (where the usability concerns
outweigh the anonymity concerns). the better. The more Tor users can
be persuaded, if not to do that, then at least to specify websites
they don't want to allow Javascript from, the better. In Firefox,
NoScript can help with this.
Here's a good noscript.untrusted, if you prefer the blacklist method
or just want to minimize the chance of accidentally allowing
javascript from an advertising/tracking domain:
ad.linkstorms.com adbrite.com adbureau.net addthis.com addynamix.com
adgardener.com ads.alphatrade.com ads.forbes.com ads.pointroll.com
ads.reason.com ads.space.com ads1.msn.com adsonar.com adtech.de
adtology3.com advertising.com adzones.com afy11.net blogads.com
doubleclick.com doubleclick.net facebook.net falkag.net getclicky.com
google-analytics.com googleadservices.com googlesyndication.com
hitbox.com quantserve.com scorecardresearch.com serving-sys.com
specificclick.net statcounter.com tacoda.net zedo.com
                                I feel the same way about adblocking. The fewer web logs I show up in,
the better. I don't see any reason why I should show up in the log of
website that is pretty much exclusively advertising. When I visit a
website, I only want to show up in the log for that website, not a
bunch of third party websites. Unfortunately, some websites don't work
without third-party content, so I guess unless I don't care about
usability, I have to make some compromises. Still, I have found
adblockplus very useful for blocking third party content without much
of a usability hit. EasyList and EasyPrivacy are very helpful. The
localizations are good if you visit a lot of non-English websites.
Antisocial is good for stopping tracking by social networking
websites. Malware Domains is probably a good idea for Windows users
who don't like to use anti-virus, or who only like to use it
on-demand. (That is, none of that active protection stuff.) Certain
other lists are good if you are visiting certain types of websites.
You know, there have been cases of people getting viruses from
reputable websites when an infected advertisment somehow made it in to
whatever advertiser they were using.
In short, I think the privacy benefits of blocking unwanted
cookies/javascript/third party content is far greater than the risk of
being profiled based on your pattern of blocking stuff, and if you are
concerned about being profiled based on your pattern of blocking
stuff, then the solution is to get more Tor users to block more of
that sort of thing.

Achter, this isn't a reply to the topic, but an FYI on how your posts show up (on my screen in Tbird). Your reply (that I enlarged text & enclosed between astrisks **, just shows up as part of the original quoted text. IOW, it's not distinguished from any previous post at all, so doesn't appear to be a NEW post or reply. * Don't know how it appears to others. * I'm assuming if you wanted to insert comments at specific point, in the middle of previous post(s), you hit enter to start new text that isn't part of previous quoted replies? Your post / reply is 1st I've seen this on - not sure why. Since I don't know which email client you have (or using some webmail), can't give specific suggestions. Usually w/ Tbird, if you place cursor in quoted text, where want to insert reply (& have it show up distinctly from earlier posts), hit enter - it "breaks" the earlier quoted post &  makes new text entered very distinct from quoted text. This is just FYI - if have any questions, please ask. Maybe I or others can make suggestions. Another FYI - a Tbird addon I use to help reading msgs w/ multiple quotes is "QUOTE COLORS."  It makes it much easier to keep up w/ what text went w/ which author. I'm sure other email clients * may * have similar addons. Cheers. _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org  Sorry. I will have to read your reply several times to gather your jist. It's not you. It's me.
 I'm not really versed in email, or virtually any thing that has to do with a computer as far as
 the enormous amounts of things any one software, including email programs, can do.
 My comment was just a spur-of-the-moment type of thing and I meant to put the person's
 quote in "quotes". I write a lot and the idea of Tor, anonymity, and the various political
 climates that exist (and the comment), just struck a chord with me. I just did it, ignoring
 the real fact that I knew it was not really a topic for this group. Please forgive me for this
 indiscretion.
 I use Tor and live in a country where using proxies is "technically" against the law. I have
 never had much trouble with it but my learning curve is so slow that I fear I will never be
 able to become a server in the Tor network. I cannot find anyone in this part of the world
 who uses it, knows about it, and who might be willing and able to teach me or help my
 learning curve pick up some momentum and speed.
 I believe it is vitally necessary to the world but that using it solely for, as I call it, "running
 hiding", only serves a temporary answer to a solvable but difficult-to-solve problem.
 Okay that's it. I try to not top-post as I think that is not okay here.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle Default settings 
I've asked this question before but this rankled me one more time.
 The only good thing I find in this is that for the first time ever (I think)
 I get to use the word "rankled".
 Here is a quote in one post here:
 "Have you installed the Tor Browser Bundle? (TBB) It contains a (limited) preconfigured Tor environment
 (you need to reconfigure the included Noscript properly as by default it is set to allow everything, which is bad)
 So, why would Tor be shipped out with that as a default setting and never mentioned by the Tor developers?
 I think in another post there was caution to not toy with the about:config in FFox yet somehow I am led to
 believe they are set for safety and anonymity by whom?, the developers who don't mention that some DO NEED to be
 reset?!!!
 I have mentioned several times now that the new versions I download always have JScript, and Cookies enabled, so I check them
 every time, first time out. And now I find NoScript, which I do not like and don't trust as it is too confusing for me, set to
 ALLOW EVERYTHING!! Something just "feels amiss" to me and I don't like that.
 Now, perhaps I have missed something or misunderstood something else, and that is entirely possible. (More than likely)
 If that is what has happened, someone please set me right and clear about what it is.
 When I used Tor some years ago, I reset many configs and double checked their worthiness with Tor developers and then with
 a newer version, checked myself to see how they matched up with the settings in the Bundle.
 My original search and resetting configs, matched most but not all, of those config settings in the downloaded bundle version,
 but I cannot help but ask again, why are those default settings that risk anon and safety, set that way? That means I am right out
 of the chute into the sh_t.
 By the way, couldn't help but notice the other day, that another American got in trouble for telling the truth. A pro athelete who said on the air that Santa didn't exist. What a country!

Yeah. And two years is ridiculous. Back in the days of source spoofing,
internet miscreants were tracked for fun through multiple providers and
countries, it took just a few hours if the right people were awake.
Everyone had some form of authentication or location data. And pretty
much everyone kept it for about a month.
The data and subpoenas are there for any real 'exigent' purpose,
primarily because providers need it for their own internal business
purposes. LEO's just need to get off their duff, and if it's such small
potatoes that they don't, well then, by definition, who cares.
I'd rather people keep writing congresscritters to keep it from happening,
for all the good reasons discussed elsewhere on the net.
Passage of such a law will promote anonymity networks in its own right.
While you're giving in, might as write the draft for them that bans
anonymity networks, because that will be next.
Torproject did a nice job with their new look and the tor users
page. And I know it's politically incorrect for them and hazardous
to the project, but in addition to mentioning China all over the
site as if it's the only twisted place in the world, the US, EU, etc
should get some lip service too by adding another section for normal
people that says 'irresponsible governments'...
"They protect their communications from irresponsible corporations."
Hollow: (intended)
In case anyone has forgotten, legislation was passed nearly eliminating the restrictions on cor-perps from spending as much
as they wish on political candidates. So, your Congresscritters will soon be (they already have been for decades), the Senator
from IBM, DOW, etc. They "no longer" represent you, the citizen. Writing them is like voting. It doesn't work in case you have forgotten the 2000 Pez-dispenser election.
It really isn't Republicons or Republicants. OR the Demons from the other party.  It's really AmeriCANTS. The only ones really taking any action,
who are motivated to take action, are those "taking AmeriCANTS actions away!" Most AmeriCANTS are doing nothing but talking or not talking.
Real action is what is needed and that isn't by trying to find new ways and places to hide. Those are running out. Running faster is going
nowhere also. Running further is coming to the end. In 2001, I believe they shut the internet down
completely in Germany, so Tor wouldn't work anyway.  What would is fighting back. Each and every day, in any way each person can find. Find something 'they' can do! Later is too late.

Now for the real problem. Please forgive me if this is off-topic but I need help real badly.
Is there anyone who really knows Mac, 10.5 Unix and Terminal who can give me some commands to use in order to login to my Mac?
We can do this at another email account if you wish.
For me: tlover at safe-mail.net
There is no one where I live who can help me. I keep searching forums and can't get an answer that works. I can give more detail outside of 'or-talk' as I don't want to piss anyone off by being off topic. I'm sorry if this already has.
I can access Terminal, create a new account but each time, the new password doesn't work!
anyway, hope someone out there can help me or all is lost!

 The "abcd.com  " in that example is any website you want to visit, followed by a dot, the fingerprint of the exit you want your traffic to exit from, and then ".exit". The fingerprint of a router is its unique identifier, and can be found in the "Network Map" window of Vidalia by right-clicking on the desired router's name, selecting "copy", and then "fingerprint". They are also available on the status websites, notably   So, for example, to visit "torproject.org  " and route your traffic through the "blutmagie" exit, you would enable torbutton and point your browser to   ~Justin Aplin

noticed that the new, very latest browser bundle for windows
 has Java Script enabled, cookies enabled and NoScript
 changed settings back to "enable globally" considered "dangerous"!
 Any reason for this? Even after I unchecked "enable globally" I started to surf
 and then noticed a different icon on the top of the window of Aurora where it
 now shows an icon for 'Tor enabled" and 'NoScript'.
 When I went back into NoScript Preferences, that's when I found "enable globally" - dangerous -
 checked again||||||||//////////??????................* flat on my face_________________ (..)
 I guess I really don't understand this NoScript. It shows one icon that supposedly "protects me",
 but that icon is nowhere to be found in the preferences panel/window. Why not? It has always
 seemed very confusing and misleading to me and why it changes settings that I haven't changed
 I do not know. I am not tech savvy, computer gravy or hair wavy. But now I must learn.
 A little help please on how or where to go, to understand NoScript. Maybe I would be better off
 just disabling it altogether? Hmmmm?
 Again though, aren't Java Script and cookies supposed to be disabled for Tor to work at its best
 in creating anonymity? I don't know how to tweak it like you'all do and I stopped doing substances
 many years ago. You know? Not playing 'hide 'n go tweak' any longer.
 Takes 3 months for a book on Terminal to reach me and there's still a month and a half to go!

Cookies from "regular old web sites" aren't necessarily the benign "little files a web site places on your computer to enhance the use of our site," that they used to be. Maybe need to read up on what "little old cookies" from avg sites can do now. Having them enabled globally - in Tor or regular Firefox - doesn'
 t seem like a good idea. Nor does having Javascript globally enabled. _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org I agree but that is what happened after I found them enabled and disabled them!
 They changed back to "enable globally" and that freaked me out. Actually, freaked me
 in as I refused for a while to "go ou"t surfing. I have to understand this NoScript but since
 the very first time I ever used it, I didn't like it. I felt uncomfortable as I perceived
 confusing contradictions or things that just seemed misleading to me. This requires
 a bright tech-mind and I am not that person.

You are entirely correct in your gues
 s as to how the system works, authenticates you, and tracks you. However, this does not mean that you're "compromised". If you use a default Tor, the wifi owner will at best see you log in, and then see that you are Tor user, and not much after that. If you are using Tor with bridges, they will likely not know even this much. > Is there a way to use public wi-fi safely? If you are on a Linux system, you can get the package 'macchanger', which can spoof your mac address to valid addresses by arbitrary vendors. This can alleviate the risk of your laptop being tracked from access point to access point. Similar utilities exist for Windows. For MacOS, Steve Jobs deemed that you must be tracked at all times (he likes to 'Think Different'), unless you decide to purchase a USB wifi device, in which case he will allow you to change the MAC address from the command line using 'ifconfig'. However, a serious adversary may still be able to fingerprint your wireless driver based on the 80
 2.11 protocol headers[1], or if there is a big white van parked nearby, by the actual radio signature of your specific device[2]. The former will not specifically deanonymize your device, but likely just narrow it down to chipset and possibly driver version. The exact capabilities of latter in the field are not widely known. Ambient noise and other devices may likely interfere with RF fingerprinting on a large scale. 1.  2.  Hello. This post made me think of internet cafes in regard to the same issues. I recently watched an online video about the ease of using Tor from a USB and the person who did the video stated that nothing is left on the host machine. Is this true?

 Also, and the following has been consistent with every new version of Tor I have downloaded:
 JavaScript and Cookies are all enabled. Why is this?
 I thought that having both disabled was better for anonymity, and perhaps safety too.
 If I 'start the Tor browser', it will connect but in order to disable those settings I have to
 change them and then restart the Tor again. Doesn't this show that I am using Tor and
 where I am? I live in a country where using any sort of proxy is illegal and risking having to
 speak with people whose logic is quite different than my culture is not something I look forward

Does TOR get money from Google a) for using Google as the default search engine? b) in general? If this is the wrong place to ask about it, please guide me to the right one. Background: Google gathers every bit of information possible. Google reads your (unencrypted) email. Google actively works pro censorship if it is required for business. Even if you might consider the use of Google search "safe" with some precautions (I don't), you endorse their actions as a company in general by promoting them as the default search engine. People using the TOR browser bundle trust the TOR project. If you agree to Google as default, many people will too. There are search engines out there that respect your privacy.

"Non-Profit" orgs have to get funds from somewhere. Some don't like Mozilla's business deals w/ Google - others don't care or even know there IS a relationship. A lot of people don't like Google, in general, because of their past privacy invasions (some of which they still do, per Privacy Policy). Many obviously don't care. Bottom line: in any business, if peo
 ple don't like a certain company or product & want other competing companies to succeed, that conduct their business in ways that's more palatable to the customer, then customers must support / use those other, often smaller companies. Else, there won't be much competition to choose from. _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org tHE COMPETITION SHOULD BE ABOUT trust AND NOT necesSARILY THE REALITY

Can or will anyone address this new pop-up when using the latest version of the Tor Browser Bundle for Windows, as to the safety of choosing any of the choices presented?
 This is it: The new window says the following:
 SSL Observatory
 HTTPS Everywhere can detect attacks against your browser by sending the certificates you receive to the Observatory. Turn this on?
 Yes No

@_subject: [tor-talk] Verifying signatures 
Hullo (',')  In light of some fairly recent postings about making it easier to verify signatures on new Tor downloads,
 I was wondering if anyone has any knowledge of a percentage (if there is at all) of new downloads that are, indeed,
 or have been, compromised Tor Browser Bundles?
 And also, what could, would or can a compromised bundle be used to do - against the client?
 I have to use internet cafe computers and cannot install GPG on them to help me even learn how to verify the sigs,
 so all I have available is getting the new version onto a USB and running it from there with my fingers crossed.
 tanks everywhere just like https everywhere

@_subject: [tor-talk] software activation 
Has anyone any experience with activating a software online through Tor?
 I have to do that soon but I use Tor for most of my internet.
 Many sites are blocked where I live so it has become common or normal routine for me to use Tor
 but I haven't tried it yet for activation.
 Now I just remember I had purchased a software some years ago but everytime I tried to download an upgrade of new fish, it wouldn't update, until I forgetfully did it while running Tor,
 and it worked!
 Jeez, am I answering my own question?
 If I am, thank you very much.
 What a quick response!!!
 Amazing.
 Thanks

Sent: 10/22/12 02:14 AM
 Interesting discussion, the first point it occurs to me to make here after reading some of the points here is that whatever your personal feelings may be on the subject matter the fact is that it is a form of expression like any other and they have equal right to their expression as any other human being. Supporting free speech sometimes means accepting and even speaking up for the rights of people who's particular form of expression we don't personally like. Every human being has a right to their freedom of expression and equally human beings have the right to make their own choice what expression they wish to access and not to be persecuted for doing so. Bear in mind that if every an authority wants to step in and lock down free speech the first ones to go will be the more obscure and or unpopular in society. Much easier to bring in laws and oppression quietly that way, problem becomes that as each additional domino falls and the easier it becomes to take down the next one
 . I note in particular the argument that the industry is associated with crimes and abuses, first off while I would not dispute that it has been given that *reputation* I would be interested to see someone present hard data to show that these sorts of crimes are in fact more common than in other ostracised vulnerable groups, like the homeless or the poor in general for example. The argument reminds me a lot of the UK governments arguments in forcing through the "extreme porn" censorship law that essentially could be applied to just about any form of consensual BDSM, the government argued that the motivation and the reason why even realistic looking simulated images must be included was that models were apparently actually being harmed in the production of this material. However when repeatedly challenged they failed to actually cite any significant cases of this actually occurring and cited exactly zero to support the strongest of their claims. That quite aside there is a go
 od reason why those acts were they to occur are illegal, well substance abuse I'll get to in a moment. There is no justification for suppressing expression even if some attempt to use that expression as an excuse or cover for their criminal acts, this could be used as a justification for suppressing just about any form of expression you can imagine not least of all that I can't think of any religion or for that matter any sub denominations which have not suffered from this issue on multiple occasions does that justify suppression, not at all. This being from someone who personally is not a supporter of religion in general I will stand up any time for the right of others to such expression all the same. As for the substance abuse issue that touches on another area I personally feel very strongly about, In trying to be brief on the subject the substance abuse issue and the global policies and practices which have been tasked against mostly in the latter half of the last centur
 y and into this one are also oppression on a global scale. Even discounting the xenophobic and racist justifications which gave rise to the current system. The system in it's current form is oppressive while at the same time cannot be justified on any grounds with a little history and ongoing scientific evidence from the modern era it can be proven to not only have failed in it's objectives but quite the opposite and that by disambiguating the harms of the substances themselves from those of the organised attempts to suppress them that it can be shown the majority of the total harm results from the latter. Breif example the UK in the 50's when it was still possible to buy cocaine in a package with syringe and needle in boots the chemist on the high street had a total of 500 heroin and cocaine addicts in the country a number which had been stable for the first half of the 20th century with well over 90% of those being doctors, nurses, pharmacists etc who were in a position to
  know it's effects. There are little to no incidents of acquisitive crime arising from it, of any form of organized crime or violence around it or for that matter of any massive health issues other than the addiction itself even for the ~8% that were not medical experts (Ironically the substances are quite safe for prolonged periods when in uncut form and with safe and reliable dosages available). It was not until heroin and cocaine were both banned did an appreciable number of ordinary laypeople begin using it recreationally and that number exploded dramatically, at the same time the price also exploded leading to acquisitive crime and increasingly more dangerous and violent criminal gangs forming on the profits, the emergence of which caused a rapid increase in the rate of new addicts also, 50 years turned the stable 500 of the 50 years before into over 310,000 and resulted in harms per addict that exceed by far those of the entire 500 for the most part. In response we hav
 e forcibly removed thousands of people with a medical problem from their homes, their families, locked them up against their will and in general abused the human rights of these already marginalised and poor people and despite ever increasing aggressiveness in oppressing these people all we have done is created the pproblem that we supposably wanted to prevent and compound it with the oppression unleashed in response. As I say it's a subject I feel strongly about and could probably write books on and provide sources for more but I think it is probably rather offtopic for the list, am happy if anyone wants to respond off list. The short replies: Ok, that out of the way back to the original idea and a few responses on that, as anyone who read above can probably guess I would not have any objection in principle to the idea, supporting and enabling expression and access to such expression or information should be universal. Censorship in all it's forms is oppression and abuse, a
 nd nobody has the right to dictate to others what forms of expression are acceptable short of speech/expression which is by intent directly harmful in and of itself meaning involving actual malice ie deception, fraud, harassment etc. Answers to some specific points brought up:  Your point about users being "too stupid" to know about tor not being able to send anonymous money. It is not so much stupidity but lack of information/education and deliberate suppression, having the access to tor, to information and a community of other people who have the knowledge and experience is likely to open some eyes to new opportunities that were hidden before. Similar comment on the subject of "let them fight" to support and encourage such activism in many of these countries is not something that one can do in the clear, any group with identities in the clear that seemed to have any promise would be likely to suffer reprisals. Tor can help those with the will to fight to communic
 ate, band together, gain the strength needed to fight back effectively. If used properly of course.  Multiple intermediaries you mention are absolutely not an option if criminal persecution is likely, western union agents would face legal force to surrender customer details, the agents are independent businesses resident in the country too vulnerable to fight to protect the info even if they desired. Some of the larger providers that are based in safe countries operating online etc you mention however could *if* they were willing to fight and not take the cheap option. Unfortunately many will just hand over anything a subpoena asks for to give them an easy life. Then you have the issue of the finance provider, if a bank in that country they or their employees could face significant pressure to reveal details.  Sure video content is a bandwidth increase but many streams will only be like 1-3Mbit based on yesterdays consensus tracker the network has a total of 19.5
 7 GBit/s now yes there is other traffic also but another thing with this particular use is that probably quite a fair amount is quite short sessions. There are a lot of people that use tor for anti-censorship to reach such as youtube now without much anonymity true but those are around 1Mbit streams. Another use getting around geographic restrictions of the likes of the BBC will be HD video also, a breif search on the web will turn up a few dozen howto's on setting up tor to pull that off. As for the HTML5 question, can't say I've heard of any, but most of the better paysites provide their movies in downloadable form as a regular video file, such as wmv (Mostly old content) or most common now is standard H.264/AAC especially for the the higher quality files, occasionally see nasty wmv's or gah real for some really low end stuff. All can be watched offline without needing such as flash, most WMV's many open source video players that could be trusted not to leak anything in ph
 one homes, not sure this could be said for windows media player. H.264 is probably even better supported, would be a lower resolution and bitrate to the high def 720/1080p tv shows somebody gets and has always found work perfectly on their linux computer WMV's on the other hand are known to occasionally have issues and perhaps one in a few hundred still just decide they really don't feel like playing at all. What might cause a larger load is if someone downloads a set of videos at once for later viewing etc that could burn up several GB though from what I've seen is rare to get a single tor connection to download much over 200-300kBytes/s and paysites almost invariably implement their own anti-leech restrictions some only allow one or perhaps up to a handful of active downloading connections from either a single IP address or login identity so leeching massive amounts of data in bulk by segmenting the downloading is probably going to be fairly capably throttled by that combi
 nation. I think much of the slow max on tor could be tcp buffers needing adjustment for the elevated RTT so the clients OS is in effect throttling itself because the window is too small, I've had one like that where all nodes including mine had more capacity but never took the time to try tuning tcp to compensate.  There is no certainty in the claim they wouldn't contribute some relay capacity back if capable, sure would almost certainly be a dangerous idea for them to run an exit but those in countries where tor isn't blocked or at least not very effectively they could run a pretty safe middle, middle relays have the side benefit also that they additional encrypted tor connections for the relayed clients act as confounders making traffic analysis on the client connections that much harder, it adds the entire extra task of first monitoring and analysing to get enough data to infer information on which connections are likely client ones before they can even start do
 ing the regular network analysis on the connection patterns and timings that they could begin right away on a client only tor.  it should do I suspect, granted I havn't used the bundle I just run an exit, and definitely flash is a big no still I'd have thought what I don't know is what support does the TBB have for standard video formats such as H.264 or WMV? Many pay-sites have downloadable/streamable videos in those formats with a plugin they will stream right in the browser. There are a lot of options on the choice of media player w/ plugin also unlike flash where you have Adobe and Adobe. Many of the possibilities for the media player are also open source a big plus for bundling obviously because of the likely existence of a suitable player with a compatible licence that could simply be bundled and the ability to vet the code as necessary to make absolutely sure it is not accidentally leaking anything. For example any support for features like online metadata looku
 p/retrieval on files which some have would for this use probably be better set default disabled or perhaps even being extracted completely. The community db's for such are not exactly the sort of worrysome intentional privacy invading executable code from marketing data-harvesters you would be getting with flash support for sure but it would still be a leak to have them accessed by default and would be another party that could potentially be targeted to attempt to gain data-points so to me seems logical to default disable/strip any such features. _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org  Thanks for saying all that. Please write a/the book and give me an off-talk email and I will give you one to send me a copy.
 It is difficult to find ones way through topics such as this one ever since someone infused it/them with tons of emotional lies and misleading ideas.
 Sounds like you have a lot of well-thought out ideas that might be of benefit to both sides. Those who sense the real danger lurking, working, every day to corral us and those who have grown so far only to claim to themselves, "this is it, I make my stand here and will grow no more. I see it this way and this way is the only way!"
 One is a dead-end and the other becomes one of desperation until someone like yourself is able to bring in some calm, rational and inclusive courage.
 Okay. That's it from me, for now.

To some, looking at the pictures of starving babies, with their hanging skin, huge, bulging eyes, protruding bellies and virtually muscle-less legs and arms, is a turn on.
 Why? Because they are pictures of success and success is a turn on. They demonstrate the success of U.S., corporate and military policies, all working just as planned. Not just those of u.s. interests but those of leaders everywhere as well.
 Take a picture of a so-called, sexually abused child. Have you seen any? Do they show any of u.s. what they are talking about, or just tell u.s. without providing proof and expect, nay, demand, we accept and believe their word? Well, usually they don't.
 In 2004, a bust of around 12,000 people was in the news. The report stated that thousands of children were abused (what? 1-2 per pedo?) yet not one report of one child ever being cared for at any facility was ever reported and they have since, apparently, all disappeared.
 Did anyone see any of these children who it was said suffered some of the worst abuse the (ahem) authorities had ever seen? But who has seen them or it? Was their skin hanging off? Were their bellies from pregnancy or starvation? One is much more painful.
 Take that photo and remove it from the label of pedophile and place it with the others and now you begin to look at the right group of people who have been killing children with immunity and impunity for decades. In fact, 20,000 children, 5 years of age and under, die every single day. From those policies!!! If THAT is what a pedophile is, because THAT is what a pedophile does, then you have been looking at the wrong group of people ever since those policy-makers over there pointed the finger at others.
 While, they use them to take away your rights. Ain't that the truth. Yet, you and many like you, will proclaim that photo or supposed act that depicts supposed but never seen sexual abuse, is what? 100% unacceptable, while:
 20,000, 5 & under, dead every day, is tolerable! Why, they've got you right where they want you. You believe anything they say without proof.
 The real monsters are in office even though books were written about how to protect ourselves from ever letting that (Nazi Leaders/Stalin/Mussolini/Others) happen again.

Sent: 07/10/13 12:06 AM
This is exactly what I ask myself since one or two weeks. First it must be clear that a large amount of tor nodes is located in Germany. Next it must be clear that the biggest IP Exchange is in Frankfurt and that this will be snooped by BND and | or NSA. It is a fact that they work closely together and dont care about german laws. It must be also clear that there should be no technical problem gathering all traffic caused by the tor network. Its just some thousand nodes. If you were a NSA member: would you NOT try a lot getting as much of these data as you ever can get? Wouldnt you try to make a deal with all your partner organizations getting all data they snoop so you can fit them together? Wouldnt you try to steal as much private onion keys as possible from tor servers in the net? We all have seen the cowardly behaviour of mustly any government in the world regarding the asylum requests of Snowden. If so, which government will refuse collecting tor data and handing them out to the
  NSA? I think its time to assume in any tor related security discussion that they can and that they do. I even ask myself why the tor network is existing at all. If the US wants to get rid of it they just would do. They just would say tho the governments of their cowardly "friends" that this is criminal and all these cowardly governments would shut them down immediately. Because this does not happpen I think two possiblilities are likely: - They have already broken tor but dont confess, being happy to gather even all traffic from those who believe they would be anonymous in the net. - They say: OK, we cant get that network under real control but its useful because we can benefit from that, so keep it up accepting that some are able to hide their activities.

Unfortunately, yes you can. > Can someone tell me exactly what it means to configure Tor through IE? > Can't I configure it by itself and continue to use the two independently of each other? Anonymity and security can't be sprayed on after the fact. They need to be built-in from the start. Tor is more than just a program that runs on your computer, it's sort of like a parallel internet that runs alongside the big internet, only more anonymously. Tor doesn't do something to your computer to make it safer, Tor carries your internet traffic over a safer route. Existing programs on your computer will continue to use the existing path to the big internet. Only programs that have been configured to use Tor will use this new, safer path. Re-configuring all your exis
 ting programs is a Very Large Job, and not easily done by beginners. For beginners, almost everyone recommends the Tor Browser Bundle because it already knows about Tor. _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org Excuse me for popping in but are you saying that any other program I use that interacts with the internet,
(while using Tor) is "not configured to use Tor" unless I personally and manually configure it?
And this even though I use the Browser Bundle for Windows?
Actually I am not aware that I am using any other programs while using Tor but I am
not really sure.
If what I have asked is true, then would you please direct me to the instructions I would need to
follow in order to configure other programs? That would be a big help and how do I determine
which programs are interacting with the internet?
Could a printer or another software that I have check for updates or something like that and reveal
information about me or my machine?
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Stealth mode 
I have a simple enough question that I hope someone can help me with.
In Mac there is a setting called 'stealth mode.'
As I understand this setting, a request to a port or ping or somesuch,
will get no response from the computer at all. No indication that there is
anything there at all - like a computer.
Whomever or whatever made the request will not know.
Is stealth mode a setting that will hinder or enhance the use of the Tor Bundle?
I have read here quite a few times that the better configured one's computer
is for anonymity or security, the more one actually stands out!
Is this an accurate take on this on my part? If one wants anonymity, for those who
want the best they can get, it would seem this is contrary to what they think they have.
The same applies to security I guess.
I suppose you can have one or the other but not both simultaneously.
Anyway, I have used Tor for some time now without any trouble at all but
never really know, or know how to check, to see if I really am anonymous or secure.
If there is an archive thread concerning this, I don't know about it, so giving me a head's up
in the right direction would get me reading instead of asking you people. (how to find it, where to go)
Really enjoy following some of the arguments and nasty to-and-fros you'all get into
You all are so smart so I really need the occaisonal "unsubscribe me, PLEASE" to make me
feel better.
Do you mind if I call you Lou?
