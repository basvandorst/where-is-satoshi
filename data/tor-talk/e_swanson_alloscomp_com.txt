@_subject: [tor-talk] Scallion, GPU based onion hash generator 
I'd like to announce Scallion, an OpenCL vanity .onion address generator.
It gets around 600MH/s on an AMD Radeon HD6870 (similar on a 5770),
allowing it to generate an address with a chosen 8-character prefix in just
15 minutes on average. It's written in C# and runs in both Linux (on Mono)
and Windows.
1) Blindingly fast - 600MH/s vs. 2MH/s for shallot on an i7 quad core
2) Performs PKCS  v2.1 sanity checks via openssl's RSA_check_key function
3) FOSS - MIT licence
4) Support for 1024, 2048, or 4096 bit keys
5) Estimates time required to generate a key (on average)
Check out the Github page: or skip straight to the binaries:
If you have any problems or questions, reply to this thread or open an
issue on github.
