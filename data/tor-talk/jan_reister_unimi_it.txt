@_subject: Torpark writes to system temp folder 
I quickly ran Torpark from a USB thumbdrive, on Win XP Pro SP2.
I see new files and directories created in
C:\Document and Settings\username\Local settings\Temp
To me, it looks like a gif, 4 dll, a folder and a TMP, but this may not
be forensically sound information since I'm using the default Windows
file browser and had no opportunity to run my usual tools.
On Torpark quit, TMP  file is removed. On Torpark restart, a new folder
with identical contents (dlls, gif) and a TMP is created.
To me, it looks like it is possible to determine if someone used Torpark
on a  pc by looking at this files. As for obtaining other information
abut the Torpark session, I am skeptical.

Earth with a pin-point for each Tor server. Bonus points if it updates
as the network grows and changes. Unfortunately, the easy ways to do
this involve sending all the data to Google and having them draw the map

I assume that in most cases, the ISP just wants to pass along the notice
downstream and barely, if ever, reports back to ESA/BayTSP.
On a different level, I deal with dozens of BayTSP/ESA/BSA notices every
week in the office and it seems that 20-30% of the bittorrent notices
are bogus, and even more of the bittorrent-on-Tor notices are just baseless.
Their software agents perhaps uses tracker info for finding out IP
addresses, which produces false positives.
I received notices for bittorent on a Tor node with this configuraton:
ExitPolicy reject *:6881-6999

@_subject: OSI 1-3 attack on Tor? in it.wikipedia 
The italian wikipedia entry for "The Onion Routing" has a weird section that hints at network attacks at OSI level 1-3 using ATM or MPLS. Its's kind of convoluted, here's an abstract in english, my 2 remarks, and the original text in italian.
Tor works on assuming IP protocol's integrity. An ISP, however, can work on a lower OSI level to divert an user's Tor traffic to a separate, fake server. ATM switching or MPLS labeling can be used to selectively deviate an user's Tor traffic towards a third-party controlled Tor network. Therefore, IP address and key exchange with an unknown peer do not ensure that an user has not connected to a rogue node.
A couple of personal remarks:
- AFAIK, Tor's threat model does not include attacks on OSI level 1-3. Such an attack would be a far wider issue than Tor itself.
- directory authorities (hard coded in Tor) should make it hard to trick a Tor client into entering a "fake" Tor network made of rogue nodes.
Does that make sense?

Limiti [modifica]
L'assunzione di base della rete TOR ? l'integrit? del protocollo IP. Se il protocollo IP ? integro, potr? collegarmi con un nodo di accesso TOR per entrare nella rete, e negoziare con tale nodo il mio accesso alla rete TOR. A livello di provider, per?, ? possibile agire a livelli pi? bassi sulla pila OSI, usando per esempio il labeling MPLS o l'ATM switching, per deviare il traffico su server TOR che dal punto di vista dell'utente sono il server TOR desiderato, ma in realt? sono server fake sotto controllo di terzi. Non esiste alcun modo per l'utente che si collega con una connessione ADSL commerciale di sapere cosa succeda a valle del DSLAM ai livelli pi? bassi di quello IP: la convinzione di essere collegati con un punto di accesso TOR che abbia l'IP X, solo perch? a livello IP si crede di aver contattato un certo indirizzo di rete ? un'assunzione ottimistica, n? lo scambio di chiavi con un peer sconosciuto e non certificabile pu? garantire alcunch?; per esempio usando ATM la singola cella pu? venire trasportata trattando in maniera opportuna la coppia VCC (VPI:VCI), sul cui switching l'utente non ha controllo. Cosa simile si pu? ottenere "colorando" i pacchetti di un dato utente mediante MPLS e creando una rotta ad hoc verso una rete terza.
Terzi interessati che volessero intercettare il traffico potrebbero costruire una propria rete di server TOR, ridirigendo su questa il traffico che l'utente crede di inviare ad un vero server TOR: agendo a livello pi? basso di IP non c'? modo per l'utente di sapere che in realt? sta usando una rete TOR diversa.
TOR, quindi, pu? garantire sicurezza verso tecniche di intercettazione basate su IP, ovvero nel caso che il punto di destinazione voglia risalire all'IP sorgente.
L'errore che ? possibile commettere nell'utilizzare TOR consiste, dunque, nel credere che il percorso dei pacchetti sia interamente determinato dal protocollo TCP/IP, ignorando l'esistenza di meccanismi "ibridi" come MPLS o lo switching ATM, che possono rompere l'integrit? del protocollo, sostituendo un meccanismo di switching al normale routing. Non essendo tale assunzione reale sarebbe errato utilizzare TOR per la protezione di comunicazioni realmente riservate.

Even an exit node that allows https only (or no http* at all) is still a
great contribution to the network.
P2P over Tor is slow and unpractical, you won't see any real
downloads/uploads on your exit node, only bittorrent *tracker* traffic
sometimes, which is connection metadata. From time to time your network
will receive BayTSP notices for this bittorrent activity, which you
easily discard as incorrect/unsubstantiated/fasle-positive.

one to a second remote server he owns, with a public IP address on a
completely different network.
The relay advertises the tunneled IP address for incoming connections,
and replies with the NAT pool's public IP for outgoing traffic.
I tested it with ExitNodes and StrictExitNodes options in my torrc and
succeeded exiting from his relay with the NAT pool's public IP.
