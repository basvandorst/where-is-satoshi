@_subject: List of NODES in IP form 
this is my first post here.
So, client(user) obtains a list of Tor nodes from a
directory server.
Now I'm developing web-apps in PHP 5 and I would like
someone to tell me, how to get all IPs of those Tor nodes and put them in
a .txt file.
(each IP of a node on a new line in .txt file)
When that .txt file is created my PHP script can start
utilizing it.
Thanks for a help in advance....
Oh, one more question...
When I use tor and check my IP with some web service,
it is actualy showing IP of a last node.
Is that correct? ...or not?

@_subject: PHP coder needs Tor details 
I am new here and am trying to utilize Tor by PHP from command line.
I have read all manual and all faq but it helped me very little.
With that information I've only achived to install tor and make PHP do request through Tor.
Problem 1:
I start Tor by simply typing "tor" in command line(FreeBSD 6.x). When I tried to stop it by SIGNALS form Tor man pages none of them worked.
Obviously SIGNALS are not ment to be passed to Tor through command line(This MUST be in a man but it ISN'T!), while options with theirs values ARE ok if passed to Tor through command line.
So let's firstly solve this - How to start and stop Tor through command line?
After that I will pas question 2.
Thanks in advance!

Hey Crew.
Thanks to all for your help.
First for all I would like to say that this file.php(which is manipulating Tor) will be located in admin area ONLY and will be intended for use ONLY by admin.
Admin area is protected by Apache pass authentication (Digest) over SSL and after that is passed, admin must enter another login password to enter admin area.
Only admin will use it - NOT publicly available to users!
Firstly I need to issue to shell, from PHP, command that will start Tor.
Regarding that command...
It will have ALL directives that should "normally" be located in torrc, but there is no torrc, nor I have intention to use it.
So command is:
Regarding nodes....
Entry and exit nodes will be same.
Before I continue I would like to say that I have made a PHP script that is utilizing regular expresions and harvesting all exit nodes in a list of IP addresses from moria dirs.
So I would like to pull from my database IP of a node(NOT nickname) and put it in a $nickname variable.
Will this work? Can I select node by IP and NOT by nickname?
Also when that will be achived I am going to use PHP cURL and connect with it to 127.0.0.1:9050 using SOCKS5 protocol - then do request to some page on the internet and finaly use POSIX - posix_kill($pidfile, SIGTERM); php function to shutdown Tor, alternatively use kill to which I pass $pidfile, all in shell.
Now someone will say that I should connect to Tor using SOCKS4a and am I normall to use ONLY 1 node which will be entry and exit at the same time.
Be sure that I am VERY aware of my actions - but I am not here because I don't wana be tracked and because I want to surf anonimously.
Now here we come to the bigest obstacle for me.(oh men, soon as I finish this script I am going to read FreeBSD book that I just got and learn that UNIX at once!)

Thank you VERY much!
Main problem is that I've never been aware of DataDirectory
And in my torrc file is commented out so I'll uncomment it and alter it if needed.
Tor needs to create a directory where it can store network data.  It tried to create one at //.tor, but it does not have the necessary permissions.  You need to tell Tor someplace where it has permission to create a directory.
Have you had a look at the sample torrc file that comes with the tor source?  It is quite helpful.  Here is an excerpt:
 The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
 things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
 /usr/local/var/lib/tor
So add a line like this to your torrc file:
DataDirectory /path/to/where/nobody/can/write/tor
(that's "nobody" as in the username nobody).  You can also specify this as a command line parameter -- read the tor man page to see how to do that.

Few days ago I've successfully combined Tor and PHP and am utilizing them now.
Regarding Tor nodes... where is that list stored on a computer.
I am currently harvesting  and using regular expression to put each node in a DB by its name, uptime, IP...etc.
This makes me possible to query db for nodes I like, list them by uptime, listing by IP similarities etc...
Now l think that same file that is located at  must be somewhere where Tor is, because Tor needs to use it to too.
That is because I would rather like to open file and harvest it then open  and harvest it. - File is faster.

You better BET that if anyone is against censorship, then I AM in a FIRST LINE!
Being free and anonym is a main reason why I like Tor, so I could get rid of those greedy I-see-all govs eyes.
But even THIS world MUST have some rules.
Do you have rules in your own house where you live?
Imagine it without them.
Now, I personally don't care if someone use Tor to hack someone, rob a bank online, commit credit card fraud, or hack any other site... or anything similar.
Main reason/point is because ALL those targets have ABILITY to actually DO defend themselves!
Poor kids DON'T!!!
And solving this problem by simply shouting out "I am neutral I just care for Tor" and dare to consider problem solved is totally stupid and SELFISH act.
Even I AGREE that censorship is NOT a solution to this problem, because it would cripple Tor, so Tor wouldn't be what it was meant to be from beginning.
Point is that pedophiles are on OUR territory once they are here which doesn't mean we need to report them to authorities (and choose one side in a process how some are claiming).
We can nail them silently by ourselves, and make theirs life a hell in a process.
Rob them, hack them, expose them (to theirs relatives, newspapers, anonym "vocie" to police etc..)..., you name it! All options are opened... and in this process we don't need to abide to any laws.

Now here is a problem...
Every approx. 15th - 30th time when I choose an exit
node, it hangs indefinitely during loading site.
Be aware that I did set connection timeout for CURL at
60 seconds and that I check exit node, by loading some
site, before using that node.
If site does load, then exit node is considered valid
and then I use it to POST data at 12 sites.
Problem is that every approx. 15th - 30th time, it
hangs indefinitely at, for example, 7th site.
Even when node was checked at a begening before usage,
against 60sec connection timeout rule it can stuck at
any of sites.
Last time it did hang that way for 19 hours?!?
Obviously, it is up to Tor, because it is sending some
signal to reset 60sec CURL's rule for termination(so
PHP's CURL can't close it!!).
But there is no data coming from Tor... and constantly
reseting 60sec CURL's rule, for termination in a

CURLOPT_TIMEOUT (integer) - The maximum number of

used it before.
I've set it to 300 sec (5min).

These URLs had listed tor nodes:
Now 1st and third are timing out and second is not
giving list of nodes, but some very short info!
Can you give me a list of URLs, where I can find a
list of tor nodes?
Thanks in advance.

There are 5 directory authorities.
The first and third you listed above moved in May:
(Roger needed to relocate the computer.)
The reason that none of these are giving you a list of
nodes by
requesting the url "Tor" is that you're using an
obsolete format:,

@_subject: Which proxy to use? 
My requirements are:
1) It must have privoxy's functionality: hide-tor-exit-notation header filter to remove the Tor exit node notation in Host and Referer headers.
2) Must be capable to run as a reverse proxy.
Will be used in front of Web server
Like: reverse proxy IP 5.5.5.5
http server IP 10.10.10.10
And it is imperativ that, to client, web page looks completely, like it has been served directly from IP 5.5.5.5 based on all headers. (striping needed?)
Basically reverse proxy and firewall are on one IP that shall be requested by others and all others services on other IPs, like web on one IP and database on second IP/machine etc...
Which proxy is best for this?
And for that recommended proxy, could I get a working config(someone copy paste snips from theirs config that is already using this) to achieve 1) and 2) with coments for each line?
Thx in advance!

@_subject: Which proxy to use? 
I see, so I must stop using it and start choosing exit node by controler?
Do you mean sending directives to tor on port 9051?
If it is so, then just give me a link to doc, on that and I will rewrite my PHP app.
I wana have ONE proxy app installed
Well, curently, I am using privoxy, which achieves a) exit notattion striping, but it can not act as a b) reverse proxy.
So I need proxy with ability for both things, as said.

@_author: Mr. Blue 
@_subject: Which proxy to use? 
Eh, smart counter question.
Basically, proxy(which acts as a reverse) and firewall are on one IP/machine(A) to which shall be send http or any other requests by clients.
All others services are on other IPs, like web on one IP and database on second IP/machine etc...
Clients always see IP of machine (A).
For example request to (A) for http, makes (A) forward that request to machine (B), which has a http server installed and sends it back to (A), which then serves it back to the client.
All headers, notations, IP...etc, must be exactly same as (A) served that request directly to the client.
Basically, each service has it's own machine and IP, but are all accessed through (A) and are served like (A) directly served them.

@_subject: Bug? 
Page is fetched
Then pause of 5 seconds
Page is fetched, again -- Always used SAME url! - in both cases
There is incosistency in Tor's behaviour!!
SAME test done many times and It will always be 1 of 2 outcomes:
A) - expected
Attaching circuitID 262, to streamID '607', finished with status: 'OK'
Attaching circuitID 262, to streamID '609', finished with status: 'OK'
B) - unexpected + false error
Attaching circuitID 278, to streamID '609', finished with status: 'OK'
Attaching circuitID 278, to streamID '609', finished with status: false --> 555 Connection is not managed by controller
In B pause of 5 second still keeps same streamID
Attaching circuitID 278, to streamID '609' then  causes error as it has been already attached
error IS MISLEADING
PS: I don't even have to mention that __LeaveStreamsUnattached=1

Is there a way to completely stop a Tor from building circuits?!
__DisablePredictedCircuits isn't achiving that, as in a middle of some progress Tor will sometimes, arbitrally build 2 or more random circuits AND USE THEM for my stream.
PS: I AM aware of stream control and it's __, but wana avoid using it, because of overhead.

How to solve this?
There is a relay, which isn't advertised in public dir.
I know it's IP, port(OR) and policy AND it's FINGERPRINT.
How can I use it(select it), as an entry node, first hop.

That is how I already use it.
If __DisablePredictedCircuits would obey it absolutelly, then I wouldn't have to resort to __LeaveStreamsUnattached
When __DisablePredictedCircuits = 1:
If in target node's descriptor is written Exit and it rejects port 80 and it is STILL used to get web page from port 80,
Tor WILL arbitrarly build completely NEW CIRCUIT, and exit randomly!
__DisablePredictedCircuits = 1, doesn't give absolute control over circuits!
That is a problem. So I have no option but to pair it with strem-control-super-fun-time!
