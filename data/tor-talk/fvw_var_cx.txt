Link fixed: Because vandals will just create an account, vandalise with it, get
blocked, create a new account, vandalise with it, etc.
Ah yes of course, I hadn't thought of that. The other alternative
would be some way of specifying a connection as anonymous, at which
point the server can decide whether or not it wants to accept it or
handle it differently. It would have to happen at the IP level though,
so it's not going to happen in the foreseeable future (no evil bit
jokes please).

Yes, there are a lot of possible technical tentative solutions (and if
you want to code them, it'd be much appreciated). However, until we
have those solutions, blocking anonymous proxies is a necessity. Keep
in mind however that a single group of users being blocked from
wikipedia is losing out on the labour of that group of people, but
those edits can always (theoretically) be done by others. First-hand
experiences and other information "that's need to be brought out in
the open" shouldn't be put on wikipedia and will be removed anyway,
wikipedia is not intended for original research and other information
that cannot be verified from references anyway. Whistleblowers and
witnesses of crimes should publish elsewhere first, then once that
information published we can describe and reference it.
Oops, yeah. I've messed around with so many anonymity mix nets that
it's all become a bit of a blur :)
That's a shame, but it's also prevented a herd of vandals from
replacing 2000 articles by "Wikipedia sucks!", so all in all I think I
prefer it like this. Of course you could always edit wikipedia from a
different host (use ssh port forwarding and an entry in your
   reject 207.142.131.0/255.255.255.0:*
and mail me that you've done so, and after verifying I'll unblock your
Yup, that's pretty much it.
Quite the opposite, we've only just started large scale blocking of
anonymous proxies, and we appear to already have stopped one very
persistent vandal, at least for the time being. Apart from a few
anecdotal "I'd like to fix a typo but can't now" comments here, I
haven't heard from any major (or minor for that matter) contributors
who can't contribute any more (except a few who I've helped to either
reconfigure tor and unblocked),helped to use their ISP proxy to edit,
or shown that when editing as a logged-in user your IP isn't public.

============================== START ==============================
I've just had to block all Tor outproxies that do port 80 from editing
Wikipedia[1], due to repeated vandalism. Those of you who use
wikipedia and edit articles from the same address they run a tor port
80 outproxy on will want to add  reject 207.142.131.0/255.255.255.0:*
(this blocks the outproxy from accessing wikipedia) and mail me, and
I'll remove the block. I assume wikipedia isn't the only one with trouble in this regard
though. Perhaps it would be a good idea to have filters for certain
known protocols (like HTTP) you can put on their assigned ports that
block certain actions, like POST requests. People could still enable
POST if they really wanted (and get blocked from wikipedia and other
sites), but it would make our lives much easier and also surprise
fewer people with blocks from wikipedia and other sites (or worse,
complaints to their ISP).
