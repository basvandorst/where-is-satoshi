@_subject: [tor-talk] Vodafone DE throttles connections to the Tor network 
I don't think Vodafone is using IPv6. In any case, Vodafone knows who you are, regardless of MAC address. And it's almost certain 5eyes knows who is behind your IP, either by Vodafone cooperating/being hacked or by monitoring you non-Tor Internet traffic (MSFT/Google/Apple logins, persistent cookies, ....).
You just change your threat model a bit. Instead of 'them' being able to possibly monitor all your Tor traffic, they have a higher chance of being able to monitor some. There is a reason, Tor moved to very slowly changing entry guards.
You can be 100% sure that 'they' know all Tor bridges/entries and monitor/store forever all Tor traffic they have access to. At this point 'they' can probably decrypt a lot the older Tor traffic that didn't use the new ntor handshake. There may very well be agreements with ISPs in place to directly forward certain interesting traffic (like Tor stuff) to 'them'.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Crashing Bug priority 
A fix for bug 16771 still hasn't been released. Looking at the blog comments, people are downgrading to 4.5.3 which has criticial security issues.

That doesn't make sense. Vodafone doesn't see your Tails MAC at all. I think it's unlikely that Vodafone is throttling on purpose.
Most likely, there is some broken/misconfigured router or IDS in the path to the directory servers/bridges you used. You should try to manually pick a few different entry guards with different routing (check with traceroute).
Assuming you have a network consensus (e.g. from connecting with working bridges; there should be 'Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/cached-microdescs' and 'cached-microdesc-consensus' files), add the following to your 'Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/torrc':
Remove any bridge-related entries from the config.
Some fast entry guards in Germany that should have different routing:
darkit (37.114.52.7): 47B8A2122B924B0E54B3BDEE48DFB86E054BEB36
chaoscomputerclub5 (80.237.226.75): 0E22366D0EB12CA0CDD3693452F43BA0A1D9D515
becks (5.9.123.81): E9C8154418544764619D2CCD0596B355D7DFF236
With this configuration, you only need to connect to the the guard node and don't need to connect to the directory servers (where something seems to be hanging).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Thoughts on Tor router hardware 
You are dead wrong on that. (Semi-) transparent proxying is bad for quite a few reasons.
There is a huge number of applications with their own automatic update process that's insecure and vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. They may use non-encrypted connections, don't verify the server certificate (anyone with some valid certificate can impersonate the update server) or use weak/broken cryptography (even Microsoft update was vulnerable at one point). If that traffic runs over Tor, chances of being attacked increase dramatically, since malicious exit nodes can easily perform man in the middle attacks. This has happened in the past, with exit nodes injecting malware into downloads.
Unless you know what you are doing, a lot of your traffic will run over the same circuit (something that TBB tries to avoid) and can potentially be correlated. Some of your traffic will likely contain unique identifiers that can be tied back to you.

This is probably caused by power management. Depending on the CPU, C3 wake latency can be >35us, C6 wake latency >100us.
You should try to disable these C-states in the BIOS or kernel:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about Circuit Separation 
Circuit isolation should prevent the issue mentioned in your links. However, Tor Browser sends referrers which can link circuits that should be isolated:
Even if the referrer is fairly generic, the timestamp for visiting something plus a small amount of browser fingerprinting (the platform, some GUI configuration options, the browser window size, non-standard addons, ...) will still allow for good correlation.
Some browser actions may link different tabs:
Tor Browser may keep cookies for a long time:
These cookies can be used in conjunction with the referrer issues to crosslink unrelated tabs that opened links to the same target domain.
It's best not to rely on the circuit isolation - use separate browsers.
