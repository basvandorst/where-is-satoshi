Not yet, but it'll be released as BSD or GPL within the next few months.
I'll have to check, if we can release it earlier.

Maybe it was me, during the development of a new client, when I still had

client or pentesting the existing code?

@_subject: TOR in Java? 
our group is currently developing a Java-Client for the Tor-protocol in
Java. It's in a pre-alpha version, but we can connect and transmit data.
We expect to have something stable by the end of the year (and yes...
we're doing it in our spare time).  We also took a look at the
JAP-Tor-Code and decided to write a new one from scratch.
Taking the code, it would be possible to e.g. compile tor into a

maybe some of you are interested in this news:

The anonymity service known as AN.ON (or also JAP) will has to charge
its users starting from the second half of 2006 because its funding has
expired and bandwidth costs are too high to continue as a free service.
Yet another reason not to build centralized anonymizing networks.

I haven't done library preloading yet myself, but wouldn't it be
possible to overwrite gethostbyname() and insert a Tor-DNS-query there?
Well, of course, one need to hack some of the Tor-Interfaces in order to
make a DNS-lookup... like there are more than 200 unused command-codes
in Socks4a.

@_subject: Do not use exitnode xyz 
Hash: SHA1
If you assume an attacker that is constantly monitoring the network
(e.g. with Danezis' low latency attack) and you're more likely than
others to use your own node as an entry point, then your surfing
behaviour can be exposed.
Depends on your personal paranoia, hwo much you let your behaviour guide
by these kind of attacks, though ;)

@_subject: Protecting exit-nodes by GeoIP based policy 
Relying on the client side doesn't help the exit node operators much.
Maybe later today I might write a small bash-script that takes
GeoIP-Data and a tor-operators wishes and creates a set of
exit-policies. Then you have two separated solutions (thus the licenses
should not clash) and can integrate that in your current setup.

@_author: Lexi Pimenidis 
@_subject: Protecting exit-nodes by GeoIP based policy 
Anyway, I've written the script, but I won't release it, since it
creates a vast amount of exit policy rules, which (I guess) would not be
acceptable :-/
In the native variant excluding all german subnets would be something
like 7000 lines of exit policies. Then I added some fuzzyness and also
filtered the IPs between two subnets, if the gaps between two ip-ranges
is $close enough. Still I had something like 3000 lines of exit policies
(for germany only). Either people will have to use really large sets of false positives (i.e.
filtering traffic even if the IP is not in the country they wanted), or
there'll has to be another way of doing this.

@_subject: Another confiscation 
Now, this is strange. First: AN.ON contains some kind of law enforcement functionality -
obviously the law enforcement doesn't like to use it, although it's
supposed to be there?
Second: IIRC(!) one of the main points of criticism of the AN.ON people
against the tor project is that tor will have serious problems if the
police will start confiscating servers at a large scale because noone
will provide tor servers any more, while AN.ON will be immune to
confiscation because of the servers being provider by large companiyes
with law professionals. Possibly this argument just crumbled to dust?

Hej Folks,
our computing center had supported us (commodore64) for quite some while
from a lot of hassle (Thanks folks!). However, since a couple of days,
someone is using the Yahoo-Webinterface to send Spam. While the nice
folk at the computing center helped us in dealing with people that got
pwned and stuff, they have no understanding whatsoever for Spam.
Had anyone a similar experience? Suggestions?

Following your argument: even if someone would use Tor to send Spam via
SMTP you could say it was not "Spam over Tor", since he used a mail
relay to send the Spam. Still, using SMTP it would be generally
considered "Spam over Tor".

I read this as: the government wants to log, but does not trust the ISPs to do
the job, and possibly they do not even want to disclose what they are actually If I interpret these correctly, this law is coming into effect beginning of
next year.

@_subject: German data rentention law 
I strongly agree on this one: Tor's strength is to provide security even in
the face of compromised hosts. Any solution which tries to distinct hosts in
"logging territory" and "non-logging territory" is inherently flawed (it
simply doesn't scale: sooner or later there will be no more nodes with
GUARD-flags). After all, onion routing was invented to deal with untrustworthy
nodes. All we would have to do is to extend the security "calculations" by
admitting that a node is not only influenced by its operator, but also a
country's government. (so, e.g. if all people within the same country would
also just put their nodes into the "family"-field, this would be a first
(ugly) fix. but this also doesn't scale, as it's only a theoretical concept)
Also, it should be brought into mind that this problem will not only be a
German one, but rather a European. Hence, IMHO, solutions like picking nodes
in a circuit based on country/jurisdiction would be a better approach[1].

Just for their (and your) information: the maximum possible penality
for non-compliance is 500,000 EUR plus the fees of the law suit.
I really appreciate Tor and I also appreciate people to stand up for
Tor. But keeping Tor running without logging after January 1st and not
being filthy rich *and* having having a tons of lawyers in your kitchen
will IMHO be similar to suicide.
There got to be another alternative - and I don't refer to logging.

This could possibly be used to identify anonymous surfers: imagine an $evil
exit node trying to identify somebody surfing on $evil-site1 (which isn't
very popular and only a very small subset of people use it). It just needs
to modify the output a bit and then wait for somebody to complain about it.
Chances are, the one complaining might give away enough info to identify himself..?

@_subject: Switching Tor relay speed 
hej Marek :-)
Ich guess that it will not be a big issue to change from a low bandwidth situation
to a high bandwidth. Maybe it will take a while before the information propagates,
but that should be OK. IMHO there would be more problems switiching back to low
bandwidth mode.
Maybe a solution would be to try a slow approach throtteling bandwidth: to stay with
the example of 3000 to 100 kB/s: I'd try to go down one third of the speed every 20min.
(BTW, 3000-100=2900 ;-) ). This way you could likely avoid too much throtteling of
inbound connections, even if the information is only slowly propagating.

I read it and I'm not convinced that the uploads of the status are so much
worse than having a multiplicity of clients "knowing" the wrong bandwidth.
Just to make clear: I'm not proposing that all routers should to more
updates, just in this single case it might be better. Also: if the authorities (or for the matter: the complete directory system)
go(goes) down just because a few more updates come in, then the complete
directory system should be revised ASAP because it will break when the next
few nodes will join in.

That's a reason I can accept as given - even though I haven't checked the
dir-spec nor the implementation: if the servers ignore these minor changes,
it is indeed futile to send them.
However, it might be up to discussion, if this is good practice - but I doubt
that there is hardly enough empirical evidence to properly evaluate any
Agreed, any performance issue is important as only a performing network will
gain and keep a big number of users, which is guarantee for a decent level of
anonymity for all.
I would go even further and claim that general research on directories for
anonymous networks as a total is an area where we're still lacking sufficient
research results; hence also reporting/measuring of data rate reporting.
