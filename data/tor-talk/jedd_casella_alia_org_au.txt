Reading through this:
Trying to do this on Mac OS X.
`shasum -a 256 .dmg` clearly gives me a checksum that doesn't match the one in the "sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt" file. Tried it with 6.0.6 and 6.0.7.
From what I understand, if the PGP signature is valid that confirms the package wasn't tampered with.
But it is confusing and disturbing to a newbie to try this and get a mismatched checksum. Please modify these instructions so it's clear what this process is and what you have to do to get it to work because it doesn't work "out of the box" for Mac OS X.
