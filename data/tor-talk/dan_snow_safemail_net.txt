Thank you for these advises. But, I think to concentrate on one entry guard only could lessen the anonymity. Although the entry guards are not changed very often (after 30?60 days) in the standard configuration, there seems to be a little random selection [1]. I will have a look at this. As we all know, the IP address is no reliable identifier, but the MAC address identifies the device and probably its user. Otherwise it would be needless to disguise the MAC address in Tails. As far as I know the MAC address can be coded in the IP within the ipv6 protocol. So, this makes sense. As terrorists and torrorists are per se under suspicion, like criminals and readers of some Linux Journal [1a], they should be hindered to communicate in anonymity. Secret services and police agents around the world see anonymity and encryption as a menace of their work. And ISPs, especially the big players and former telcos of the state, are executing their needs [2]. To me it doesn't seem deviously that ISPs are trying to block or impede the use of the Tor network ("Tor stinks" [2a]). Vodafone is advertising "Secure Net" which uses DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) for filtering - to make the net more secure [3].
I am very content with the performance of the Tor network using three different unpublished bridges. [1] T. Elahi et al., Changing of the Guards: A Framework for Understanding and Improving Entry Guard Selection in Tor, WPES?12, October 15, 2012. [

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vodafone DE throttles connections to the Tor network 
The ISP Vodafone Germany ('provided by GCHQ') is slowing down network speed extremely when trying to connect to the Tor network. Although advertising that there exists no DSL throttle [ it is becoming more and more difficult to download the required directory information at the beginning ["Establishing an encrypted directory connection"]. Often this is stopped by timeout. "24.04.2015 01:10:41.335 [NOTICE] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 29/6587, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of exit bw.)"
The highest download speed is then at 4-6 kB/s or in better times at 15-20 kB/s. This way it is impossible to use the Tor network with Tor Browser to open a text-based site with html or to download e-mails with Torbirdy in Thunderbird. At the same time connections without Tor (Browser, ftp, torrent download) are working with speeds up to 1.5 MB/s. The throttling occurs using the latest Tor Browser versions on Windows or Linux systems, also when connecting with obfs3. The connection to the Tor network seems to work 'uncensored' if I use Tor Browser inside Tails with the preference of changing the MAC address. So, I would assume that the device's MAC address and / or the IP address which is almost always the same (provided by the router, although there are three or more different users), is used to block connecting to the Tor network.
"17.01.2015 00:17:19.658 [NOTICE] Bootstrapped 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server 17.01.2015 00:18:57.352 [NOTICE] Delaying directory fetches: No running bridges 17.01.2015 00:19:02.760 [NOTICE] Bootstrapped 15%: Establishing an encrypted directory connection 17.01.2015 00:19:02.806 [WARN] Proxy Client: unable to connect to x.x.x.x:xxxxx ("Connection refused") 17.01.2015 00:19:02.807 [WARN] Proxy Client: unable to connect to x.x.x.x:xxxxx ("Connection refused")"
With separately provided bridges [ Tor Browser is working fine.
[May 15, 2015] Today's direct connection to the Tor network: downloading with 20-30 kB/s; downloading the latest version of Tor Browser here resulted in a corrupted file.
With custom bridges the download speed is around 600-1200 kB/s.
Vodafone seems also to learn these non-published bridges. I had three different bridges in "Tor network settings / enter custom bridges", and after a period of uncensored connections two of three bridges are blocked now:

I wouldn't have assumed that communications without surveillance are becoming that difficult in Germany. A lot of countries is developing legislation that makes encryption illegal or nearly impossible now.   GPG key information:

Josef 'veloc1ty' Stautner:
As I tried to explain, I examined different constellations (Linux, Windows, without Tor network, with direct connection to the Tor network, with published bridges like obfs3, with unpublished bridges, with Tor browser, with Tails) at the same hour. Working were and are only connections without the Tor network, with unpublished bridges, and with Tails (changing the MAC address). Therefore I would not suppose these disruptions to be temporary network problems. Using unpublished bridges with Tor browser eliminated the problem. If necessary, these bridges could be changed.   I see this as a questionable action by the ISP, trying to hinder customers to connect to the internet without being monitored.
Voting alone will not change this.
Best wishes,
