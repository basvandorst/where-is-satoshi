I lost my password there.
Now, there is no link on the page itself to reset password, at least it isn't visible to the naked eye.
After some googling, I found that /projects/tor/reset_password would be the correct page. But it demands matching login and email, and for some reason it doesn't find my account (though I am sure I know login and email): "The email and username must match a known account." It looks like a dead end at this point.

I have a tor relay running with default parameters, see torrc below. Ports 9001 and 9030 are forwarded WAN->tor server on LAN in router, and LAN->WAN is open.
There are no messages in log, all seems to be ok. Vidalia says that relay is running. However, the bandwidth used is nearly zero (there are only minor spikes contributing ~1MB/hour). My relay also doesn't show up in torstatus.blutmagie.de (no such nickname).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why my relay doesn't get any traffic and doesn't 
No, I meant there are no errors or warnings in log. Tor relay appears to start normally, self test messages are all there.
Now, after several hours, it is listed on torstatus.blutmagie.de with a very low bandwidth 2KB/s, and my connection is ~50Mbps.
"View network" shows several connections, but they are just very slow.
One bothering thing is that many messages are repeated 3 times for some reason, see below.
So here locally there is no visible indication of any issues, tor as client also works fine. The only problem, is no bandwidth through relay.
The most bothersome message in log is this:
Nov 21 11:50:54.000 [notice] We weren't able to find support for all of the TLS ciphersuites that we wanted to advertise. This won't hurt security, but it might make your Tor (if run as a client) more easy for censors to block.
Nov 21 11:50:54.000 [notice] To correct this, use a more recent OpenSSL, built without disabling any secure ciphers or features.
Could this be the reason? But the message itself says this isn't a critical issue.

How can one be sure that firmware that is running on the router is built from this particular source code and not from some modified version or different revision? Also how can one be sure that one extra service wasn't added on top of this open source? I think the answer to both of these questions is "impossible". In addition, governments have the power to execute the secret order on the company to secretly add such back door.
Open source only makes sense when built and installed by the party interested in security, or maybe when it is built by some trustworthy organization, like some trusted linux distro, and not just some random commercial company without any reputation.

Nope, there is no solution. Hash can only prove it comes from this vendor, it doesn't establish vendor trust. You practically can't prove that firmware is built from the particular source since it is practically impossible to duplicate the build environment for any complex project from the real world.
Sorry, this doesn't make any sense.
Yes, trust comes with the open review, and transparent build process.
None of these is possible with firmwares supplied by commercial companies. Therefore, no trust. Product in its original form is pretty much useless for what it is advertised.
However, there are many useless products on the market, and commercial success doesn't seem to correlate with "usefulness". So I only wish them well in their endeavor. Nice try anyway.

I think this very model buy-and-use isn't compatible with security because, as it was discussed before, there can be no proof of firmware being built from the particular source. So such simple commercial usage model can only rely on the authority of manufacturer, which in the modern world it can't realistically have.
Once you deviate from this buy-and-use model and move on to buy-reinstall-use, the first question is why would anybody even use the open sources of this manufacturer? Or even why whould anybody even use this hardware at all? You can just install OpenWRT or dd-wrt and tor on one of many existing router hardware be better off. All firmwares of particular manufacturers I saw were horrible, and also not-rooted. And there is no indication what the HW specs and price will be.
Generally, unless router hardware is truly open source (and again how can this really be?), tor run on the computer is much more secure IMO.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why tor doesn't support UDP? 
It is well known that tor only supports DNS UDP requests, and not other UDP.
Tor could relay UDP through the same path as TCP. And the chosen exit node could act as a UDP gateway, much like regular routers relay UDP packets from different LAN hosts. Routers substitute source port of UDP packets and later map back the ip/port in response packets. It could be easily imagined how tor could do just the same.
When I use the virtual machine connected to network through the tor, only http apps work, and all UDP apps fail. Even skype is unable to connect.
So what is the reason that UDP isn't supported?

I only see security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy in FF, and it only applies to the file URIs (as its name says).
Otherwise, cross origin access is allowed, as demoed here Browsers should not allow cross origin from global URI to local URIs and loopback addresses. There are only 3 classes of local IPs + loopback I am not able to verify this now. But if browser allows this, this is a major security violation.
The danger of such cross-origin access is that the remote site can use this to learn something about the local network of the client, which should be disallowed.

If you are after high anonymity and security, you should run your browser from the virtual machine. This issue is probably not any worse than potential DNS leaks, or connections accidentally made around tor. Hunting down such bugs is ultimately unproductive, and will always be inferior to security-by-isolation approach. You can take a look at Whonix distribution, which is merely a chained pair of virtual machines, middle one configured as a tor router, and a tail one working as a client. Any OS can be a client. This solution is far superior to TBB approach, and has much more limited potential of being compromised. I wish tor project could offer something similar.

This actually depends on what to mean by "Tor". If just the network level part, then yes.

If tor project went one step further, and developed security-by-isolation approach (using virtual machines, like Whonix does), this could prevent practically all client side exploits. And pretty much the only way user could be deanoned is if he himself typed in his personal information, or logged into some service shared with other identities.

But if you run HS in the virtual machine that is disconnected from internet, doesn't have any personal information on it, and the host only forwards HS requests to it (from the tor process), this should be quite bullet proof against identity leaks. And if you ever find yourself in the heightened state of paranoia about the off-chance that virtual machine can somehow leak the memory contents, the next logical step is to run HS on the physically separate machine, on the separate network, that is not connected to internet.

There is no need to port TBB to BSD. Not worth of the effort. TBB is unable to 100% separate tor and non-tor connections due to the network stack architecture. TBB users are typically recommended to disable JavaScript, to disable Flash, to not go to certain websites, to not use any plugins and addons, etc. This doesn't sound like a very secure system. The potential leaks (IP and DNS) are virtually unavoidable with TBB.
Security-by-isolation approach provides much better security in general, because it relies on the small and simple code in the core of the network tunnel.
Whonix  is a very good solution available on all BSDs today. For some reason it remains under-appreciated.
I myself also designed and implemented another solution for FreeBSD: vbox-to-tor  It allows to run the user choice of OS in VirtualBox machine which is connected to the tor instance that is running on the host. It is extremely easy to setup, only few lines in rc.conf. (well, it will be extremely easy when it will be in ports and when kernel and port patches are in).

I understand your concerns. But I would also like to point out that "New Identity" for most implies new identity for everything. This is how, I believe, majority of technically not very savvy mass users thinks.
Also, tolerance to the broken connections is supposed to be built into most modern well-behaved apps. At least that is what is reasonably expected from the apps in the world when poor connections, ex. barely functioning WiFi, is a commonplace.
So I would say that the users should be given such option, provided they are informed of what it actually does.

Hi Leeroy,
Telnet? This is the mass audience we are talking about, they don't know what telnet is. This isn't related to bugs in particular applications, rather the decision by user to switch to the new exit node for everything he is doing, whatever this might be.
So you discount the concern of the OP in this thread? I found the question to be reasonable, I am sure many people have the same question daily. The way how "New Identity" works today is counter-intuitive for the average user. Giving the user more freedom is always good, provided full disclosure is given. This is like the freedom that they already have to shut down the networking on their computer, or press the "Reboot" button. It isn't always beneficial to keep all connections as long as possible by any means. So let the user decide. I didn't mean this feature to have the hidden consequences.
In everyday life, users already make such decisions: do I connect to WiFi alpha or to WiFi beta? Do I use this website, or that website? Do I reboot now or later? This function just extends such freedom, that the user already naturally has, to what this user does with tor. This is quite reasonable IMO.
In the real world connections are broken all the time, this is just a reality. Nothing to lose your sleep over.

I only don't understand why you are you so sure that the system with the hypervisor involved is more secure. Just because something relies on the "bare metal" doesn't mean that it is inherently more secure. I will give you two examples of compromised hardware:
* Certain three letter agency managed to subvert some BIOS manufacturers to  to inject malicious code into the kernel during the last stage of BIOS boot. In such case system boots up in already compromised state, and this is virtually impossible to detect. This can quite easily include Qubes.
* Intel manufactures many (or all) their network cards with something called Active Management Technology included:  Such cards are able to connect to some remote locations even without the running OS. And I am sure that even with the OS running they probably can also initiate connections and send some data out. Nobody but Intel knows what such cards really do.
Virtual machines already provide very high security, practically infeasible to exploit. Qubes provides an improvement on top of "practically infeasible". So this is the hair splitting situation, with very marginal risk difference, and other factors like the possibility of the compromised hardware might easily be the higher risk compared to this difference.

However, there is the Whonix gateway ( that you can run as a virtual machine, and you can connect any other OS running in another VM to it. This will be very close to what you have asked: it will work as a tor filter for that OS. But any programs depending on UDP (like skype) will not work.

Yelp is very sensitive to this, because too many businesses ask customers to write reviews while they are still in the office, show them Yelp, ask to open an account, etc. Yelp wants to prevent such things, and wants to have access to "real" IPs for that. That is one of the reasons they ban tor. Banning only POST requests is what one would do when they try to be open about what they are doing. Yelp doesn't try to be open, and instead lets you leave the review, then watches people's activities and patterns, mines data, and then labels certain reviews as not recommended. They also don't hide reviews immediately, only after a week or so, when they figure you aren't looking any more. This is different philosophy, and much more subtle and secretive approach.
Otherwise, people can access it without login, without cookies, I tried few VPNs, it also works fine through them.

@_subject: [tor-talk] WebRTC to uncover local IP 
I reported this as a bug to chrome and firefox a long while ago. Chrome people said there is no web standard that forbids such IP leaks and closed the issue as WONTFIX. Firefox people expressed some interest, but apparently didn't address it yet.
It is outrageous that browser leaks the details of your local networks, unrelated to your browsing.
This page itself, btw, fails in chrome.

It is nothing inherently unsafe in pdf format itself, and any other document formats aren't any safer. You probably confuse pdf and PostScript, which is more like a programming language. PDF isn't nearly as much a programming language as ps is. It does have interpreted elements in it, but so do all other formats.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Talk footer needs have an extra blank line before it 
tor-talk messages trigger BODY_URI_ONLY (+1.0) in SpamAssassin when somebody writes a message with only one paragraph, without the trailing blank line. The footer that ML attaches has no blank lines and URI in it, and SpamAssassin thinks the message and the footer are all one paragraph, and the message is likely a spam for whatever reason.
ML needs to either add the blank line before the footer, or lose the footer.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Tor project idea for internet comments 
I think your description is very vague, and lacks details, therefore inviting only generic replies.
Who/how will decide what resources will such comments be attached to?
Where are they stored? You mention "relay" and "tor app". But there is no such thing as "tor app". Do you mean having something like distributed hash? Who will own such data? What is the way to ensure they don't disappear?
How do you deal with abuse, spam?
You need to write the more detailed and specific proposition, otherwise your idea will die in comments in this thread, and will not go anywhere. Proposition should make it clear that such idea can indeed be implemented, only then it can attract attention and motivate some

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mailpile SMTorP [ref: nexgen P2P email] 
On one hand, Mailpile is after security, which is great. But on the other hand they use node which doesn't sign packages, therefore being vulnerable to MITM attacks. I think, node js is either fundamentally opposed to signing, or wants to bundle it with their commercial version, or something like that. With this trade-off (convenience of node vs security), Mailpile certainly doesn't look like as secure as such system could be.
Node js also has the insecure command that downloads code direct from github. So if some github project gets hijacked or bought out, guess what will happen?

But such attacks exploit bursts of traffic with higher-than-average byterate, or frequent changes of the traffic intensity. Would an option limiting bandwidth of the tor connection also make it more secure in the similar way?

@_subject: [tor-talk] These Maps Show What the Dark Web Looks Like 
The article says "this lack of diversity in hosting infrastructure is concerning—it places the future of a large proportion of Onion Services in the hands of a limited number of groups". The future web might even have no hosting, because the new technologies like ZeroNet don't require hosting at all. I personally believe that distributed architecture is superior to centralized architecture, and is a way to go.

ZeroNet actually comes very close to a completely decentralized web. The sites aren't static, they are very dynamic, modern looking, with JavaScript and css. ZeroNet sites aren't censorable. User comments propagate to everybody and are automatically displayed in the real time. Their mail is also fully distributed. Every site is controlled by somebody, but everything has to be controlled by some entities. Nothing is really self-organizing. You can also clone any site, including ZeroMail, and control the clone yourself. As for the Freenet and Gnunet, they both are very much dead. I think ZeroNet is among the best recently emerged technologies.

You may have confused the thread, or maybe even the ML, because the message was about the ZeroNet, and not about torrents.

Bitmessage recently had the new release 0.6. The hidden service support will be added in one of the next releases. Currently it can work through tor using a proxy.
Given there are a lot of users in the network, bitmessage hides both the content and the fact of communication, quite similar to tor.

Please consider using Whonix  instead of TBB.
It runs tor in one virtual machine, and your browser in another virtual Whonix is a much safer way to use Tor, since it isolates your OS from the clearnet better. It cleanly redirects all internet requests to Tor at one single point. TBB just can't do it quite the same way, and is more likely to leak requests into the clearnet.
All you need to do is to install and start VirtualBox, and add 2 Whonix virtual machines into it.
