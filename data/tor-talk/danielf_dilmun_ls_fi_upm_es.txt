Its verly unlikely that the issue comes from an incompatible version of OpenSSL and Tor because it fails in windows too :/
Any help is welcomed, we were donating more than 1MB on bandwidht and now nothing...

Well, im not asking for help to run a Tor relay, I did it for more than a year without problems. Im asking for help to gather intel so I can make an statement to our ISP (I work at a Dept. in a univeristy) to unblock Tor.
Our ISP wont say nothing about their filters (It seems to be a Top Secret issue :P). As I said before there's no problem reported at debug.log except for the [debug] TLS error: unexpected close while reading (SSL_ST_OK)
Nope. Transfer rates are equally ridiculous. Tried in windows, same.

Well, you know, network administrators are one species by themself. My University spent almost 1M? (yeah, one million) in a network filtering infrastructure and we're still waiting to know *What* they are filtering and *why* (here we make network research and we need to know if something fails and why); that was one year ago...
So no, I've not asked for an answer on Do you block TOR?. But I know for certain what they will answer, nothing.

still no luck with our bandwidth problems. I even tried to set up a tor relay under windows (to discard a linux problem) and it does not work.
Also, if I setup an https server at 9001 or 9030 and download a file from there it works fine.
Can you help me to gather some clues on how our School is filtering Tor?
I need that information so i can fill a request to stop Tor filtering.
PD: Will it help if I pastebin a debug log?

I'm the admin of CriptoLabTorRelays[1][2][3][4]
As you can see at [1][2][3][4] our relays are having almost no transfer rate (3KB or so)
It started on Monday 14 of November and after some testing we came to a conclusion... Our Univeristy (our workplace) somehow filtered Tor without us noticing.
I need your help to get some proofs of the filter being applied so we can make a statement and ask for permission.
Looking at the logs I see a frequently
[debug] TLS error: unexpected close while reading (SSL_ST_OK)
PD: We even tried using bridges (as in  with no luck.

Is it really so infrequent to send SSL chunks of size 512B?

Maybe it's just a stupid question, but why there are two version from the 0.2.2 branch being released?
Is 0.2.2.27 a patched version of 0.2.2.26?

So, Why release an unpatched version?
It's just out of sheer curiosity, Im using 0.2.2.27 anyway
