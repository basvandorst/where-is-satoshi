@_subject: Something Strange Happens to google when Tor is enabled 
I just started to use Tor with the firefox extention. When the extention is on and I do a Google search wether it's with the search plugin in firefox or going to google.com I get rerouted to google.de which is not in english. I can use the english version of google just fine without the extention on and when I use IE with Tor running in the background. The workaround for this is to leave tor off when doing a google search and enableing it in firefox when I am done. Since Tor is all about privacy, I'm exposing my IP to google when I do this. Can you please explain my problem if you can and tell me how to fix it? Also, I'm behind a router so I don't know if that means anything. Thanks.

I went directly to  but the same problem came up. On the Gernan google homepage there is a link to google in english. When I put my mouse over it, the url I will be going to is  which redirects me back to google.com. I typed in google.com/nrc and it did the same thing. Now can you or anybody please help me make a search plugin that includes google.com/nrc. I tried to make one, and will try again, so that I can get google to be in english. Thanks Andrea for your insight on how the google search plugin works,

i think that google have this strange behavior because the search plugin
of firefox use this address:  and this address try to
redirect to the google-localized(.de .fr .it) viewing the ip that have
requested the page. most of the exit tor node are situated in germany
and in this way the most time you go to  you are
redirected to  to go directly to  --

Thanks Mike for helping me. I changed the action to  and I got results in english. Strangely though putting google.us brings me back to google germany. I think that google.us looks at the ip address that's requesting the results and figures I'm from germany. but it doesn't matter, it's fixed! thanks to everybody who helped.

Thus spake Roger Dingledine (arma at mit.edu):
Actually, this has never worked for me... However what does work is
changing the action line to be google.ca, google.us, or - action="
+ action="
