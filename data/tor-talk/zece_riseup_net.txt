Hey fellas!
I want to organise a few texts into a minimalistic website. Something
slim and fast ready to run well from an .onion. I want html, css and
graphics only if very important. And the verbosity and definitions kept
to a minimum.
I could do that with a notepad-like app. But that means I risk messing
up the markup. I could use something like nVu, but I still have to link
the pages and do all the micromanagement involved. So I thought to
myself why not use some CMS. Only I don't know which. The output should
be HTML, trimmed down CSS and graphics only if needed. I don't need or
want AJAX, JS and other fancy scripts that double or treble the file size.
Finally, I guess I need something like pdflatex. Give it the text and
compile the result. Leaving me to sync the local directory with the
site. Also, knowledge of markdown would be a serious advantage. Call now!

That was my point. A CMS that outputs plain HTML and no dynamic stuff.
That would handle the tree structure and even some RSS. Gota give that
team a thank you, including the late Aaron Schwarz, RSS is a wonderful
thing in this torrent of information.
There are also some text editors that can do the change. But also the
app building the site can do it and attach the header and footer in the
same step.
Thank you for your answer. If there weren't any FOSS projects already
doing what I need that would have been the best path.

The Doctor:
Wonderful! Precisely the thing I was looking for. Thank you so much!
Google can't help if one is asking a question too vague or generic.
?Static Site Generator? was the keyword for what I was looking for. All
that's left is examine them long enough to decide which one to learn.
By the way, do you have any idea how to link, if needed, a way to
communicate with the readers? A generated link to a textboard? Email
makes people thing they are the only one bothering to comment.
Registration makes people think it's too much of a hassle.

Nice to have that in mind. Inpractical at the moment as I travel too
much to have a dedicated box. It would be so nice for the Tor project
too to expand the onion space with a few more sites. But not now.

David Vorick:
No. Everybody sees what you send to tor-talk at lists.torproject.org
Including the junk you have not edited out.

Seth David Schoen:
Of course not.
Free software is about helping people be free. It has to do with
freedom. Open source is just one of the requirements.
Open source movement is about corporate PR.
The confusion comes when people are happy with freeware or one of the
apps with available source and think free software is about the same.

Moritz Bartl:
Why trust them? You have GnuPG who can do ASCII armor. You have various
techs to attach binary. Meaning a Truecrypt container for what I know.
One still has the labels: who sent who at what time. But nothing about
the contents. Add random, password like 8 char username and access over
Tor and things get pretty well.
