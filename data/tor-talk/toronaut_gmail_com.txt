@_subject: [privoxy-users] Reverse DNS Lookups? 
I want to use transparent proxying with iptables, but running sniffer,
iptraf or IDS from local DNS not desireable: I view connection to entry
but DNS resolve will be visiblble on the Exit node.
Is it possible for some users, or root (UID=0) use provider DNS?
like this:
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT-m owner --uid-owner $NON_TOR_USER_UID   -j RETURN
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT  -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
or any better idea?
