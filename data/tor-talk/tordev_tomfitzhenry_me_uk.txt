If this factor (2^N) is considered too low, we could be make it harder by adding an
additional superfluous computation. For example, rather choosing the block header as
our random value, choose SHA-256(SHA-256...(SHA-256(block_header)...) as our random
value. Say, k iterations.
This increases the cost factor to be k*2^N.
Optionally, replace "repeated SHA-256" with one of PBKDF2/bcrypt/scrypt/similar.
Bonus points for the additional computation not being SHA-256 based, because an
attacker is likely to have the ability to compute SHA-256 quickly (to be able to
compete with other miners, who have machines built to compute SHA-256 quickly).
One problem with a /constant/ factor, k, is that as attackers/miners become more
powerful, the constant factor becomes less of a problem. To combat this, k could
track Bitcoin's difficulty[0]. Doing this is more complex, however, and may mean the
directory services have to implement more of the bitcoin client spec.
As an aside, note also that it takes a certain amount of time for a mined block to be
considered part of the block chain. Conventional wisdom defines this to be 6
blocks[1], which is on average one hour. So, if the authorities got together at
23:00, they should look at the block closest(?) to 22:00.
