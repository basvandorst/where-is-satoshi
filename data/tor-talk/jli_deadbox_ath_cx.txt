@_subject: Can governments block tor? 
Nothing. Nothing prevents me from doing that, either. Do you trust me?
If you don't have end-to-end encryption, it's not confidential. Period.
Here's a wonderful FAQ entry answering your question in much more
I highly recommend the FAQ, by the way. Great reading. Very informative.

@_subject: ExcludeNodes by country 
This is a bash script intended for unix-like systems. You *might* be
able to get bash under Cygwin to run it, but the file paths are
different on Windows and unix-like systems, so you'd have to edit the
script to adjust for that.
In summary: it's possible, but complicated, to get the script to work on
Windows. Hope that helps.

@_subject: (Newbie:) Why use privoxy? 
HTTP is pretty darn tricky. Tor does IPs, but the application layer of
HTTP throws in a lot of other variables. Here's some things to keep in
* IP address: Tor handles this
* Cookies: Before I maintained a whitelist of sites that could set
cookies, but that's somewhat of a hassle because some sites refuse to
work without them. Now, I let any site set cookies, but I set Firefox to
only keep them for the current browsing session.
* Java+Javascript: You could disable it completely within Firefox, but I
use the NoScript extension so I can quickly enable it.
* Web bugs/beacons: 1x1 pixel transparent gifs. I don't think Firefox
can block these on its own. There's a Privoxy option to disable them,
* "Referer" strings: I used to use the RefControl extension to spoof the
Referer. Now I use Privoxy to do the same thing.
* User-Agent strings: often, Linux distributions will modify the default
user agent string of the browser (like tag on "Ubuntu package" to the
end). This could be used for matching communications. I used to use the
User-agent spoofer. Now I use Privoxy to do so. I spoof the string so I
appear to be using IE 6 on Windows XP, however, based on the assumption
that this is the most popular user agent.
* Other identifying headers: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding,
Accept-Charset, and even If-Modified-Since headers could be used to
identify a web browser, but I'm not sure how unique those are.
If you're on Linux, you can see some of what your browser is saying
about you by running the following:
$ nc -l -p 8088
Then going to "localhost:8088" in Firefox.
I'm sure I've forgot some things, but I think I covered most of them.
Between Tor, Firefox's built-in options, and Privoxy, I feel relatively
