Let's not dread on things out of our control; IMO we should use these
concerns to develop solutions then turn them into soultions that we can
implement. Obviously we can't develop around assassinations nor state
funded terrorism, but we can develop a solution for  backdoors
and information leaks.

So the PKI method that bitcoin uses is a sha256 encoding + sha1 decoding.
The OR provides a PKI key (sha256) with hidden services, so the solution
may be switches that run openCL or CUDA to authenticate the key to the node
(parallel computing is still the fastest way to compute) . If the node key
does not match the node could be isolated from the network.

TLS is a top layer cryptography obviously with jitters its exploitable,
just like any other s box crypto.  That's why it's generally deployed witg

I think Tor Project does follow Mihkal Bakunin principles on Freedom...
III. Freedom is the absolute right of every adult man and woman to seek no
other sanction for their acts than their own conscience and their own
reason, being responsible first to themselves and then to the society which
they have *voluntarily *accepted.
IV. It is not true that the freedom of one man is limited by that of other
men. Man is really free to the extent that his freedom, fully acknowledged
and mirrored by the free consent of his fellowmen, finds confirmation and
expansion in their liberty. Man is truly free only among equally free men;
the slavery of even one human being violates humanity and negates the
freedom of all.
V. The *freedom *of each is therefore realizable only in the equality of
all. The realization of freedom through equality, in principle and in fact,
is *justice.*
VI. If there is one fundamental principle of human morality, *it is freedom*.
To respect the freedom of your fellowman *is duty; *to love, help, and
serve him is *virtue.*

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about possible increased risk of censorship 
All depends you could just be as easily caught in some restrictive regions
(China) be caught relaying via cellphone and sat connection.
Most likely to find services such as tor they are using NMAP scans of
ports, the best solution is to use a VPN in a non-restrictive region then
relay tor. So during port scans tor wont show rather your just using a VPN.
