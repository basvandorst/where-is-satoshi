Would it be an option to add a "jurisdiction" parameter to each Tor-server? Don't know if this could be done automatically using Then, each client could choose its circuit from at least two different jurisdictions and turning over logged information as required by the new german law should not be as bad (assuming the police does not control Tor servers outside their respective jurisdiction).
I don't really like that idea though, as it would add a lot of complexity. It is however much better than just giving up and potentially losing (german) nodes.
