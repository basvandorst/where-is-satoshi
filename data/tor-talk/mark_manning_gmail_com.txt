@_subject: Tor with DynDNS on FC3 
Problem:  Can't get tor run due to it not resolving or understanding that
the IP address is a dyndns one
I've installed Tor on a local server at my home running Fedora Core 3.  I've
edited the torrc files to act only as a server.  I use DynDNS to maintain a
consistant name resolution.  In the notices.log I get this message
repeatedly every few minutes.
Jul 29 10:35:30.648 [warn] second_elapsed_callback(): Your server (_my ip
address_:9030) has not managed to confirm that its DirPort is reachable.
Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
Jul 29 10:43:52.679 [notice] connection_edge_process_end_not_open(): Have
tried resolving or connecting to address '[scrubbed]' at 3 different places.
Giving up.
I'm sure that I have forwarded the correct ports through my firewall to the
tor server.  Here is what my torrc file looks like:
SocksPort 9100
RunAsDaemon 1
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/keys
ControlPort 9051
Nickname _my server nickname_ [properly registered]
ORPort 9001
DirPort 9030
This should be pretty standard from what I understand.  I even used the web
based wizard to try and make the torrc file for me and I'm getting the same
On a windows machine, I can run the tor client and it works just fine as a
server but I haven't been able to get it running on linux.  Other people
have had this problem as well but I haven't seen a resolution.  Can someone
shed any insight?

@_subject: Proper TOR DNS Configuration Testing Help 
Hello - I'm just starting to pay attention to this mailing list so forgive
me if this subject has been brought up before.
I'm interested in setting up a [or using an existing] service that could
test for a proper DNS configuration [among other things].  The goal being
that a person could visit a web page to confirm that their DNS queries were
being forwarded through the TOR network and not using a local DNS server.
HD Moore of the Metasploit project has had some interesting success with his
Decloak research project
[link]which as I
understand it, uses a custom DNS server and a special web page to
force a client to resolve a special domain name where the server can
correlate the lookup name to the IP that is making the request and thereby
determining whether or not their DNS queries are coming from a TOR exit
My question is has anyone had any experience with this subject they would
like to share?  Specifically with existing services out there or any ideas
for implementing such a service.
The final goal for my humble project is to come up with an ubiquitous
testing page that could report with relative certainty that a user's
environment is configured properly for anonymity or not and do so without
assuming any specific client-side capabilities [ie Javascript, java,
cookies, etc].  My hang up right now is finding the best way to test that
DNS queries are going out over the TOR network.
Again, I apologize if this is a silly question but I appreciate any

That's awesome!  That's exactly how I was thinking but to be honest I wasn't
sure how to implement the background service that ties the query logs to the
web server.
If it wouldn't take too long, do you think you could talk about the
specifics a little bit more?
