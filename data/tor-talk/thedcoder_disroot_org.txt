I agree with Seth, this particular YouTube frontend/proxy seems to be
more focused on offering an alternative viewing experience rather than
One interesting thing I have noted which may improve privacy (but still
does not outweigh the risk involved) is that this site provides video
playback without requiring JavaScript, so it maybe suitable for general
purpose use for users who do not wish to have JavaScript enabled.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why do you use Tor? 
I began using Tor as a way to circumvent censorship... so anonymity or
privacy were not my primary goals. Some of you may know that I made a
program called ProxAllium which keeps Tor running in the background so
that I can use the SOCKS proxy in my browser to circumvent censorship.
These days it is different though, as I have switched to Linux as my
main operating system and therefore could not use my own program. I also
have a VPN and use Mozilla-Cloudflare's DoH DNS to circumvent DNS-based
censorship from my ISP...

While I am not 100% sure if this is correct, but the Tor package should
be portable, so you can try just moving the whole folder across to
"transfer" the stuff.

Tor browser used to have this option to refresh the circuits but it
seems to be removed in the current version as I cannot find it now
(correct me if I am wrong).
If you are using Tor directly, you will need to use a controller to
instruct Tor to form new circuits. Nyx seems to be the most popular option :)

Ah! Thanks for pointing it out, I vaguely recall finding it initially
after the redesign of Tor browser, but I had forgotten about it.

Yes, the Tor browser UI went under some design changes once Firefox
Quantum (onwards version 57) was adopted in TBB, before that there
wasn't much UI integration with Tor related settings with the rest of
the browser, I believe this was due to the "Torbutton" being restricted
to an extension, so all of the options were available via the onion icon
in beside the address bar.
Take my technical opinion with a pinch of salt as I am just guessing.
