@_subject: Setting country code? 
Is there a way to set Tor so that you only use a specific country for
what would appear as your IP address if you checked your IP address at,
say, myIPaddress.com?

Here's what I read at the above link
and may disappear in future versions. You get the best security that Tor
can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the
entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand.
What don't they recommend?  Is it the "ExcludeExitNodes" they're talking
about that they don't recommend you use or does it apply to Entry and
Exit also?

My concern is that I don't trust particular exit or entry nodes
especially if they're in a certain country.  I've read that a country's
intelligence service might even be running the exit nodes.

When I start up Portable Tor I get the following message;
Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols
specified are supported
What does this mean and is it critical to the operation of Tor?

@_subject: Tor & Email? 
I'm curious- in what way can Tor be used for emailing?  When someone is
connected to the Tor network is there email routed along the Tor network
too?  Or, does it go through their the normal connection with their ISP?
