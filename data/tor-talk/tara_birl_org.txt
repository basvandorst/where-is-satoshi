@_subject: lots of DMCA request's... (1/day) 
Hi everyone, I run an exit node (nickname: swopusa), and now I'm averaging 1 DMCA request per day for TV shows, movies and the like, from paramount, NBC universal, etc.
I do BW limiting @ 100k/sec -- 2GB/day.  Otherwise it's the default configuration.
I'm really not all that smart about tor, I've never even used it as a client. I don't mind occasional DMCA requests but 1 a day is starting to piss off my ISP (linode.com) and frustrate me.
Any one have thoughts, besides NOT running an exit node?
With Love,
