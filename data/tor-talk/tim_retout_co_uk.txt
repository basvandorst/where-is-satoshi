I'm interested in the answer to this question, because I keep changing
my mind as to whether hidden service Debian mirror(s) are worth setting
up.  Would we need to create a redirector service like http.debian.net
to balance the load?
In terms of load on the Tor network, I would have thought that hidden
services cost double the bandwidth, because they use six hops instead of
three.  But I don't know whether exit node bandwidth is the bottleneck.
If anyone's really interested in apt-transport-tor, by the way, there's
this quite interesting bug report that I wouldn't mind more eyes on:
(which actually affects anyone running apt over Tor using e.g. tsocks)

If you can access BBC iPlayer, you might be interested in tonight's
Horizon episode on issues related to Tor:
I'm still watching it, but it seems relatively balanced, and features
interviews with Bruce Schneier, Jacob Applebaum, Julian Assange, Tim
Berners-Lee and so on.
(And Horizon had average viewing figures of around 1.7 million people
in 2013, according to the internet, so that means many UK people
getting better informed about Tor.)
Kind regards,
