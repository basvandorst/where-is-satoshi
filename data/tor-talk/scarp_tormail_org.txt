Are you volunteering?
All I see is a lot of "think of the children".
The Hidden Wiki isn't run by TorProject its just 'some onion site',
there's also multiple hidden wikis on multiple mirrors probably run by
multiple people, none of them are likely related to TPO staff.
torproject.org also do not have special administrative powers over
onion sites or wiki directories. So this whole discussion about them
doing something about it or trying to censor it is pointless because
they can't.
If you don't see it on torproject.org then it is not the TPO, and
doesn't really even belong on this mailing list.
You're unlikely to find child porn on Tor unless you go looking for
it, and if you do then there's nothing Tor Project can do to protect you.

I see.
I suspect that Tormail has received a significant amount of traffic
from tor-talk and it's spam filter has decided to
mark it as spam.
I too think I've missed some emails, and recently received this mail:
I sent a mail to the tormail admin, I hope they can sort something out
for us.

I rather like tormail, because the provider can't hand over any
information even if they wanted to. You access it via a .onion so the
actual locations of the remailers is unknown.
Sensitive or private communication, should be encrypted with pgp, and
this must be at the user's end, ie with enigmail+thunderbird for example.
Any web-mail provider that does 'pgp' or stores your pgp keys isn't
beyond handing those keys over. I think in the past hushmail has done so.
Unfortunately I've found a couple of problems, sometimes I get a
message from the tor-talk mailing list like:
However clicking the link in the email seems to fix it. I'm on some
other mailing lists like liberationtech I haven't had any issues.

I was actually thinking exactly this myself.
I don't see any point in a browser extension if you're going to go to
the extent of installing that why not just use an email client.
It would use a lot less bandwidth to use a email client like
Thunderbird and use POP/IMAPS than a web interface anyway.
I'd also argue that it's a lot more secure too, given that
implementations like FireGPG always had issues.
Also, the source code for the extension would need to be available,
and then it would be bound to particular browsers, not a good move in
my opinion.
It would also be only available then on particular platforms. I know
for example with PGP I can decrypt emails on Android using K9/Kaiten
with APG.
Also as it would only be used with one provider, the code would have a
lot less widespread usage in comparison to something like Enigmail and
Thunderbird or Sylpheed etc.
I also think hushmail's Java requiring extension is a lot less usable
than a decent mail client with pgp support, even inexperienced users
detest horribly slow java applets. Then there's also the fact that
Oracle can be kinda slow to fix 0day Java exploits, and those nearly
always revolve around the web browser.

When I read this I was thinking "hmm, if he was using https" then it's
unlikely that this could occur. I'm pretty sure that's the default
nowadays anyway, especially for authentication.
You can further tighten security by using two-factor authentication.
My guess would be they got the password some other way other than
posing as a malicious tor exit node.

I actually think that list is a joke, because it combines people that
provide legitimate services with obvious scammers.
It does actually say on tormail.org/tormail.net:

suitability or anything else.
The reason it is called Tormail is because you need to access a .onion
to get to it. Probably not the best name as I guess some people could
interpret this as inferred affiliation. They do fully disclose they
have nothing to do with the torproject.org group.
You'll also notice  says:
software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project. as well.
I have not used torfone, but I assume it is called that because it
requires the Tor software.
As for torguard.net I'm not quite sure what they are inferring by the
usage of 'tor' in the name, as I don't believe it would use Tor for
anything. To me it just looks like a anonymous VPN provider, one which
was reviewed by TorrentFreak:
On the other hand you have other entries on that list such as:
"download-tor-browser.com" which is an obvious scam to get you to

And how exactly would you propose that TorProject verify such a list?
Keep in mind anything on the trac is _not_ necessarily endorsed by
torproject or official in any way.
It is just one user's opinion. That particular list is unsubstantiated
and does not provide any evidence for it's claims.
On the other hand, you should assume any email provider can read your
mail, so if it is sensitive use client side encryption such as pgp.
Then you will know for certain only the recipient can decrypt it. If
it is an account used on a mailing list such as this one, it is going
to be public anyway.
It is probably a good practice to sign your emails too, this makes
impersonation virtually impossible. (Assuming you keep your private
keys secure).

Just objective, I doubt the tormail administrator could be bothered

Yes because someone working at Google is clearly willing to risk their

you should complain to Google about it if you think this has indeed

While that may be true the list is only 'trademark' violations or
confusions, ie people who have contacted torproject.org asking for
clarification whether those addresses are affiliated or not.
The list does not does not claim to contain entities that have
committed "bad deeds", nor does it provide such evidence of such acts.
For a user to interpret it this way would be improper usage of the list.
I do however the list isn't very accurate. Given that the description

Version of Tor Browser with installer that installs some addons and
looks like it optionally installs adware/spyware toolbars

Contains unknown changes, full source code isn't available. Old
version of Tor Browser.
Where as:
* tormail.org & tormail.net
Introduction pages for the actual tormail service located at
 email is not accessible through the
tormail.org or tormail.net domains.
They also clearly state at the top of their page they do not claim any
affiliation with TorProject.
I don't see how they are "trying to confuse users".
* torfone.org
Once again states up the top in red "This product is produced
independently from the Tor? anonymity software and carries no
guarantee from The Tor Project."
Looks to be a free open source VOIP solution that utilizes Hidden
Services. I can't vouch for how good it is, but it's obviously not
trying to pretend that it has some sort of official endorsement or
affiliation to TorProject.
* torguard.net
Has nothing to do with Tor and doesn't claim to. I believe the "tor"
comes from abbreviating "torrent" as they advertise themselves as a
anonymous vpn service for bit torrent users.

I see a couple of problems with the LikelyTMViolators list.
1. Such a list puts projects such as tormail, torfone, torchat and
torguard in the same box as the fakers producing modified harmful
binary distributions of torproject.org software such as the tor
browser bundle.
2. It helps increase the page rank of those sites, this could be
making the problem worse.
3. It's easy enough for fakers to create new sourceforge accounts or
domains when their site or project page appears on the list.
(I did a bit of Googling around and found a number of sites that are
bad which are not on that list).
4. It kind of seems like a country trying to make a great firewall. As
soon as a site gets blocked people use another one.
5. It doesn't really protect users at all from the bad guys.
I think a better message to send is that software that is not on
 is untrusted,
unverified and not endorsed.
I guess this is why it is "just a note" on trac and does not have it's
own very special page on the main site.
Unfortunately some users seem to interpret it as a badware/shitlist
when it's not anything more than a list of sites that contain 'tor',
some might be good, some obviously bad.

Agreed, besides you want it to be indexed by search engines so you can

Sensitive content shouldn't be posted to the mailing list in the first

SiNA Rabbani:
TBH I'm not even sure why it's still on source forge when it's clearly
in violation of TPO trademarks. Guess SF don't take that too seriously.
There's actually a number of other "Tor Browsers" besides the
of them seem extremely dodgy and seem to be distributed on SF.
The thing that worries me is that by calling it "Tor" or "Tor Browser"
they are attempting to trick users into believing it's the same as
torproject.org's distribution of the "Tor Browser".
If these were genuine projects there's no reason why they can't call
it something else.
I'm just worried one of these might be an adversary to Tor trying to
distribute a compromised version of Tor to a particular community in
order to compromise it's user's identity.
