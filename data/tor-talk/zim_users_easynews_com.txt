@_subject: Querying TOR server info 
Is it possible to get the list of current entry guards my TOR server (Linux) is using? Sending USR1 signal doesn't seem to print this particular information in logs. It shows current introduction points, but not guards. Is it possible to determine them by looking at TOR's data files? This quite easy in Vidalia/TOR client-only installations, but a server is completely different story.
Regards, JB

@_subject: Weird-looking circuits in Vidalia 
When I started up the newly installed Tor 0.2.0.22-rc r14114 for first time, in addition to the typical Guardnode1,Nodename2,Nodename3 circuits, some weird lines ones below appeared in the Vidalia circuits list.
I copied only first few characters to this message. Those look like raw Tor node fingerprints or something. They disappeared after Tor had been running for a while. Is this some new feature, Vidalia bug or something weird going on?

They're caused by a new Tor feature. Starting with Tor 0.2.0.22-rc,
Tor does encrypted directory requests rather than plaintext (http)
directory requests. These show up in the Vidalia circuit list as a bunch
of one-hop circuits, since in reality that's what they are.
I wonder if Vidalia should hide these one-hop circuits from the user? Or
maybe users in the future will get used to seeing them in the list?
Ok, thanks for the info! How about replacing these strings with text like  in future? That would be be little more descriptive.
