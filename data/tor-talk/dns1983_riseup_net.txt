@_subject: [tor-talk] [OT] Smartphone purchase advice? 
Hi, as far as I know reading on replicant.us and libreboot.org, actually doesn't exists any modern smartphone fully free. Typically the GPS, WiFi and modem firmwares are closed source. Moreover almost any arm device implement the PSP technology, which is something equivalent to Intel ME. Last but not least I don't know any recent smartphone which as a free boot loader.

I think you are affected by cognitive bias. You are blindly looking only for bad things. Of course the network is not perfect, but is the best we have, and we should make our best to improve it. I instead see that you are trying yo delegitimate everything. If you don't like why are you still here?

I'm not in the position to talk about the architecture or other technical aspects because I'm not expert enough. I don't say that the network doesn't have problems.
But i think that some things you said are a bit of stretch; for example, why adversaries should finance tor project and publicly it if they have a malicious intent?
It would be interesting to me to know what other people think about what you said.

Excuse my bad English, probably I'm not writing correctly.

With rather curious amounts of potentially highly
