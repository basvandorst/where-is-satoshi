@_subject: torserver verified without request 
i'm not quite sure what to say, i'm still thinking, maybe i'm stupid...
but here is the thing: i'm running iapetus (134.130.58.205)
as you can see on [1], iapetus has been verified. as one can see on [2],
it is verified for about 1-2 weeks. now here is the thing:
i never asked anybody to verify it. roger dingledine wrote me a mail
some month ago (Thu, 9 Jun 2005 03:16:44 -0400) and asked, if i wanted
to register it, but i refused for several reasons. now i don't really
have a problem with this, as most problems are resolved. but as far as i
understand, nodes should only be verified on request ?!
