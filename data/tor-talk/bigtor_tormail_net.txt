If you configure and use it right, I think it's safe. Remember to change
the SocksPort option in torrc and to let tor use different pidfiles.

Thanx Roger.
 see  and
look for SOCKSPort [address:]port|auto [isolation flags] .
SocksPort 192.168.1.1:9050
SocksPort 192.168.1.1:19050
works (when removing SocksListenAddress if you had that).
I configured two different browsers, one to use port 9050 and another to
use port 19050. I visited  seven times (every
time killing tor and starting it again) with the two browsers and two
times got the same result (same IP of exit node) in both browsers.

Advise is to install privoxy and edit the config file something like
listen-address 127.0.0.1:8118
forward-socks4a /	127.0.0.1:9050  .
so privoxy forwards to Tor (on port 9050) and you tell wget to connect to

Sounds like 'chicken egg' problem; One's country blocks
bridges.torproject.org to find bridges. There's a big chance that they'll
block the rest of Tor also, so .onion addresses won't work.
