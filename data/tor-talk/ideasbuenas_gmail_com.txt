I'm not referring to this.I'm talking of a lot of URI that appears when I
try to link to any site. Every one of those Remote Address start with a
couple o letters followed by numbers like this:
server-54-230-83-145.mia50.r.cloudfront.net  .

Another example is this   s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com    OR
edge-star-shv-08-gru1.facebook.com  OR
ec2-54-225-215-244.compute-1.amazonaws.com   everyone resolving to

Visiting the same website with Tor or normal Firefox its gave me the same
Remote Address:
as an example. While ones repeat themselves in both browsers, others not.
One class of unidentifies servers are the ones that not respond to a whois
lookup. Other class use an address that not resolve in whois with that
address and instead belongs to other

I don't trust Google neither Yahoo nor Bing. If they have captchas and your
phone then they're done and you're screwed. Don't be afraid of using Riseup
a lot. They are in the market. But I think, Roger can do something with
this (sorry, I talk to the boos, not to the hand). Perhaps he don't because
there are more people talking of Tor than using it. Cheers.
