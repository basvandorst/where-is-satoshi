Hi Everyone,
Just recently safe-mail.net started acting very strange. Also, I have strong reason to believe some mail accounts have been compromised. Does anyone have any input about the current status of safe-mail.net?

There's no real difference. I'm thinking now that this is probably off topic but these services are often used over TOR. -------- Original Message --------
Apparently from: tor-talk-bounces at lists.torproject.org
