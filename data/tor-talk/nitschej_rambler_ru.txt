@_subject: Tor bridge not generating any traffic 
Thanks for all the answers.
It seems my view of what a bridge is was
wrong. I thought a bridge is a link point between tor nodes which
forwards traffic from an entry node to an exit node. But as I understand
it now a bridge is kind of a "secret" entry point into the tor network.
As I read in the FAQ the standard path lenght is hardcoded at 3. So how
would I have to configure it to run as a node that operates as an entry
point(not secret necessarily), a forwarding node but not as an exit

@_subject: Tor bridge not generating any traffic 
I am trying to operate a tor bridge on my VPS. The system is an Ubuntu
hardy the tor version is 0.2.0.34 (r18423). I have attached my
configuration file so you can see if there is any error in that one.
Regarding the log files I only see one error reported in them:
Jun 10 08:02:51.040 [warn] Your server (207.210.117.7:200) has not managed to confirm that its DirPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
But that one is not true from what I can see. The VPS is hosted in the
US and if I connect to that port from Germany with nmap it is shown as
But that I think is not the reason why I don't have any traffic on my
node. So the question is: Is my configuration faulty? Should I send in
my log files? I have a notice log and an info log.
