@_subject: [tor-talk] HOWTO : setting up an obfsproxy bridge on torcloud 
Hello, I just finished writing some instructions on how to set up an obfsproxy bridge on torcloud images.
It's largely based on but differs mainly on two points :
1) the way to fetch .deb files necessary to build obfsproxy, as they are not all included in the ubuntu repos
2) instructions on how to workaround bug  (basically cloning tor's git, hardcoding one port in transport.c and compiling+installing
it), as it affects torcloud image's tor setup.
It should cover most problems/questions torcloud users may have, and be useful in getting more people to set up an obfsproxy bridge
However, it is not the cleanest way to do it, it's only the current simplest way.
Hopefully in a few feeks/months it'll all be a matter of two apt-get install and one torrc modification :)
Let me know if something is wrong with these instructions, and feel free to spread them/reuse/modify them otherwise.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking Tor - solutions? 
There is no solution as the traffic going through Tor has to come out of an Exit node, and those are public thus easily blacklisted.
In the end Tor helps you hide who you are, but not that you used Tor to access the service (in the service's point of view).

You may try to restart your modem to get a new IP.
...and try not to do anything that will get you banned in the first place, I guess ?

Yes sorry, I think I terribly misunderstood your original message in the first place.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor users trackable with common proxy? 
As far as I understand it, as long as you check the tor software's signature, and use obfsproxy, I don't see how they would do such a thing.
Checking the software's signatures should ensure that you are not bootstrapping from harcoded malicious fake nodes or looking at the wrong
nodes list, and obfsproxy makes sure there is no recognizable handshake pattern. Even if they suspect it to be tor traffic there is no way
they can MITM an obfsproxy communication.
But again, I might be totally wrong here :)
