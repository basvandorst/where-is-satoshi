@_subject: [tor-talk] Announcing OnionLauncher: a Launcher for Tor 
Hi tor-talk mailing list,
I'm not sure how many of you will be interested in this, but I'd like to announce a project I'm working on called OnionLauncher. OL is a Launcher for Tor written in Python and uses Stem and PyQt5.
If you're interested, the GitHub URL for OnionLauncher is at this URL:
 (
I hope you enjoy my project.
Thank You,
Neel Chauhan

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTP/3 on UDP and no TCP 
For this, we will require Tor to support UDP, or at least be QUIC-aware. Hopefully TCP-based HTTP will be supported for a few more years, but we can't expect the web to support TCP indefinitely (look at SSLv3, no website supports it anymore).
To support UDP or QUIC, some architectural changes to Tor may be needed: It will certainly be a large undertaking, but probably is necessary (unless we want to lock Tor users from the web of 5 years in the future). Maybe we may need a new anonymity network for QUIC. Who knows?
Disclaimer: I am a Core Tor contributor. I am no expert on QUIC or HTTP.

We could also use a QUIC

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is tor server now to heavy for a Raspberry Pi 2 
You could make MaxMemInQueues lower, lets say 512MB for the RPI2B.

However, there can be multiple cell providers, each with their own IP allocation scheme. Your cell provider may be the dominant provider in a monopolistic market, or it may only have a fraction of the market if you have competition. In the latter scenario, most mobile Tor clients in your country may not change their IP very often if they aren't on the cell provider you described.
Even then, one could count as multiple users as well even if their IP is mostly static (e.g. sticky IP). For instance, my laptop goes between my work network and home, counting as two networks. I also have a smartphone which may change its IP based on Wi-Fi or LTE data, and a server running an onion service (to be decommissioned soon, nothing interesting however).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Snowflake vs China 
However, some "dynamic" IP addresses are sticky, especially those used by non-mobile ISPs using DHCP instead of PPPoE.
This means these IPs more or less stay the same for a period of time, unless you change your router MAC, but the ISP reserves the right to change them anyways when the network changes without notice, unlike "static" IPs which ISPs try to avoid changing unless they have to.
Heck, because of "sticky" IPs, many people with FTTH have "guard" relays (including myself).
But for Snowflake, this could be an issue because a country like China could block a residential IP for a while if they enumerate. However, Snowflake bridges are usually short lived so IPs come and go and it's harder to block (but don't assume it's unblockable, there's deep packet inspection and machine learning).
