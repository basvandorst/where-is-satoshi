I'm not too sure about this: you can run hidden services on tor  clients which do not relay any traffic for the network.
Starting a service is not that difficult: an home flat Internet  connection and a low power computer are ideal for a small personal  hidden service.

Actually, you can use a donkey client with tor but it will be useless:  you'll end up as a leech with no one being able to connect to your  real ip address.
On a side note, I'm not too sure about the burden of a torified donkey  client: leeches get really slow download speeds.

Yes, iPhone os does not support socks proxies in the network settings.

Beware of the cellular data bandwidth comsumption limitation too (no
reference on hand, sorry). I do not have enough math skills to prove it
but I suspect it could facilitate statistical attacks against
hypothetical iOS Tor users.
Anyway, your project looks promising :) keep us informed!
P.S.: an even better solution for jail broken devices would be that of
running Tor in transparent proxy mode but I still don't know how to
enable such support in iOS

Hash: SHA1
It's either looking too trivial to me or I really do not understand
anything about it (which is probably the right one as I'm really low on
coffee right now).
Could you elaborate a bit on the issues?
So far my understanding is that "--with-tor-group" should not be called
anymore during configure, so a patch would be to just remove
"--with-tor-group=%{torgroup}" from the rpm spec %configure line :-P
If noone wants to go first I'll gladly take a look at it: I did rpm
packaging in the past and I'm mantaining Slackware Tor build script over
at  .

I think the best solution is to just remove the configure entry and keep
creating the _tor (or tor) user and assigning it the _tor (or tor) group.
I can't see why there shouldn't be a _tor group for the _tor user: you
will need a group for the application user anyway and changing it from
its standalone one to a shared one like "proxy" is a system upgrade
nightmare as you correctly said and a security weakness as well (a
broken application could leverage its belonging to the shared group to
try to modify Tor configuration files).
Just my 2 cents, obviously!

Totally agree: Tor itself works out of the box on iOS but this is not enough to get a safe browsing experience.
By the way, a tutorial for installing Tor on jailbroken devices is here: I do not want to spread out the wrong assumption that installing Tor from my repository is enough to be completely anonymous with your iDevice so I need users to be able to follow not-brain-dead-easy instructions ;-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] using themes in Aurora 
I took a look at personas back in 2009: when it was still in an early experimental stage and it was distributed as an extension, I was able to register a cookie exchange with your browser and personas server. The exchanged cookie contained the IP address of the browser as seen by the server.
I noted it in my 2009 e-privacy talk:  (Italian only, sorry).
However, since personas get stable and became an official feature of Firefox I wasn't able to record that cookie again, so I didn't mention it in the next events.

According to Mozilla:  everything should be encrypted, both in the browser-server communication and on the server side, while storing your data. They also affirm data is encrypted in such way they cannot retrieve the plaintext.
I haven't wiresharked my connection to get a proof but, since the user has to specifically log in, as already noted by Erinn, I would say it's safe to leave it enabled.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Aurora only build 
Mozilla moved away from the PPC platform around version 5.x and the code base has grown incompatible since then. You should take a look at  if you need something which looks like recent Firefox versions without all the hassle of building it up yourself.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Aurora only build 
Errr... I think you missed a point ;-)
Aurora IS Firefox or, at least, it's the release name.
When building custom version of Mozilla products from source you can't use the same name as the official packages. That's the TL;DR of the Mozilla Public Policy.
TBB is a custom version of Mozilla Firefox built by the Tor Project and shipped together with Vidalia and some other programs and libraries.
So, if you want to have something which looks like TBB on a PowerPC Mac, install Vidalia, grab a copy of TenFourFox and install required extensions.
Beware this is not enough!
TBB has been built to address a specific threat model and Firefox has been patched and configured accordingly to that model so I'm the first to warn you that "just run Firefox with required extensions" is close enough but not the same thing.

Oh my, another clone. I wonder what they did repackage this time.
These things make me tempted to stop working on Tor for jailbroken devices.
Anyway, sources for Tor on jailbroken devices are here: Binary builds and repository here: These links are "official", which does not mean they're endorsed by torproject.org but that code and binaries pushed over there either comes from torproject.org (e.g. the Tor source code) or from me (patches and build scripts) and you can always manually build the .deb files if you do not trust my repository.
As a plus, I always sign the pushed .deb files, even if Cydia does not check them (it sucks).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor iOS repository is back online 
Hi all,
I'd like to announce that the Tor iOS repository is back online!
TL;DR is just a two step solution:
1) If you still have the old repository installed, remove the "Sid77's Source"
package, otherwise skip to step 2
2) Use Cydia to add a new repository and write or paste this url:
Quick FAQ:
+ What happenened?
Around the beginning of April, one of the machine of the slackware.it network
suffered an awful disaster. Both of its disks failed, and sid77.slackware.it
was hosted over there :(
+ There was a backup?
Obviously not. Well, to be honest, I *DID* a backup the day before the disaster but
I wasn't able to retrieve it in time. How lucky! :D
+ What does it mean?
Source code was mirrored on several places and on github.com so it wasn't a
big loss, however, the old GPG signing key with ID 0x6295C2FE is gone and
lost. Eventually, it will expires in 2015 but I am pretty ashamed of not
having a revoke certificate handy.
+ Why did it take you so long?
Me and the rest of slackware.it admins were all busy with Real Life(tm), we
tried to recover what we could from the disaster before rebuilding the missing
pieces from scratch.
+ Ok, now what? How can I have the repository back?
First, if you still have the old repository installed, remove the "Sid77's
Source" package, otherwise go on.
Open Cydia then go to Sources->Edit->Add and write or paste this url:
 then tap "Add Source".
Once the repository is recognized tap, on "evelyn" (its name) and install or
upgrade "Tor Toggle".
Packages are signed with the new key with ID 0x09F4FCCE: Cydia will import it
as son you add the new source to your repositories.
+ Do you know there's a "Mobile Tor" package on Big Boss repository?
Yes I do. It's not mine nor I endorse it. It was uploaded by "W00t" and its
package ID is org.torproject.mobiletor but I do not think its an official
torproject.org package.
I downloaded the deb and, as far I can tell, it should be an all-in-one
version of every package I have released so far: it contains Tor, Polipo,
libevent and the startup scripts. I think it misses the SBSettings toggle but
I'm not that sure.
I have already released an updated "Mobile Tor" version 0.3-4 in my repository
which should be picked up by Cydia. In theory, the upgraded version was
useless as the two packages have different IDs but I'd like to be better safe
then sorry ;-) Well, it should be a good idea to remove BigBoss' "Mobile Tor"
before upgrading to my packages as both of them will try to write the same
That's all, in the following days I will update the rest of the site with
package descriptions and everything else.

============================== START ==============================
TL;DR: If you're using TBB, you are safe
I address this specific problem at DeepSec 2009 with the talk "Breaking Tor Sessions with HTML5", at the time it was possible to de-anonimyze a Tor user using the HTML5 video tag together with a specific poster attribute.
The idea was to instruct the browser to fetch the main video via http and the poster via ftp, bypassing Tor.
TorButton and the Tor Browser Bundle in general put defenses into place to protect your from this kind of attack.
