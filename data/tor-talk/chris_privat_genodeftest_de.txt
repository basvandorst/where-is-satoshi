@_subject: [tor-talk] Anonymity of RSS readers 
I want to read some RSS feeds and still care about anonymity.
To do that I have to choose a RSS reader which is
a) not using Tor
I think this is a bad idea since I will open some (maybe 10%) of the
feeds in torbrowser ? this would undermine tor
b) using Tor
This is a bad idea too since I regularly fetch some hundred RSS/Atom
files, some of them via unencrypted HTTP. This would clearly undermine
all anonymity provided by tor. This problem gets even worse when the RSS
reader loads content (e.g. images, JavaScript, ...) when displaying the
What can I do?
I have only one slight idea of a solution: Use a RSS reader which
fetches all files via tor with a random lag between [1]. It MUST load all
content (images, ...) instantly OR remove and never display it.
Do you know such software?

Yes, I meant that.
Thanks. Looks like I'll try that.
Using IsolateDestAddr is not an option since this would be my web
browser opening a new circuit for every domain/IP I connect to. This
would be something like denial of service for tor (at least the local
tor daemon).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Crasher in tor browser alpha when playing videos 
I found a crasher when playing videos in tor browser 5.0a1. This is not
present in current firefox releases. It happens on different websites
with a  tag, even on simple test sites. This issue was not
present in TBB 4.5.
Is this issue known? If yes, where do I find it (to not ask this
question next time). I searched on trac without finding anything useful
If not, how do I debug this to find the cause and help fix it? Just
running the same command line as the starter script does, inside gdb:
gdb --args ./firefox --class Tor\ Browser -profile
seems to be a bad idea and does not work. I could not find any tips for
that e.g. in the FAQ [2].
[1] [2] Regards ? and thank you very much for developing tor

Thank you, that's exactly the bug I am running into. Thanks for the
links anyway!

I am on Fedora 22 and already reported to the trac issue. It is indeed
the MP4 video tag as described there.
