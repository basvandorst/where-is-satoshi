@_subject: [tor-talk] how useful is tormail? 
Privacy issues aside, Tormail has really terrible uptime for an email
provider.  There are several that have great uptime and work really well
under Tor. I would recommend these above Tormail:
* Lavabit is one that I would recommend, as it is light, has solid
uptime, and doesn't require javascript.
* Vmail.me works well and offers POP/IMAP, though it does require
javascript to create an account or use their webmail. * Email.is also works well, though you need another email account to
have the password sent to.
* GeurrillaMail.com works well as a one-time email for account
confirmations and if you just need to send one message.
Zoho comes highly recommended, but in testing I wasn't able to create an
account while using Tor.  And for me at least, Gmail is unusable in the
browser under tor.
  Of course, no email provider provides complete content privacy --
right now only PGP encryption can offer that. Griffin Boyce

@_subject: [tor-talk] Limiting number of outbound TCP connection from One 
Hi Fabio,
  To recap the discussion for everyone else, we were talking about
blocking portscans on exit nodes.  While it's possible to block a
targeted portscan by limiting what ports can be accessed in iptables,
blocking a broad vulnerability scan with many targets is trickier.
  I'm rather curious as to how a circuit would be effectively defined in
this case.  While Tor circuits do rotate every 10mins, it wouldn't
really be possible to map traffic to a single abusive user.  It would be
more of a guess.  So instead any rules apply to everyone using the exit
One solution could be something like either:
    iptables -A inbound -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m limit \ --limit
5/s --limit-burst 3 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A outbound -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m limit \ --limit
5/s --limit-burst 3 -j ACCEPT
  Limiting traffic to five packets a second would also shut down both
types of malicious scans.  Though the limit settings would be dependent
on how much traffic the server typically gets.  If the exit op is
graphing traffic, that would be helpful - how much traffic, how frequent
major spikes are, and perhaps any correlation between traffic quantity
and abuse complaints.  Finding the upper limit during peak (legitimate)
usage periods would be great, but it's also worth noting that I'm also a
graph nerd.

The answer to your second question is no, because private bridges are

people want to expose their private bridge networks to outsiders like
yourself. People frequently roll a set of bridges *for their own use*.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Interesting cases regarding DNS poisoning in China 
Thought this post would be of interest to tor-talk:
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hello, I'm with the GreatFire.org team and we observed some interesting
cases regarding DNS poising in China recently.
The domain "webcache.googleusercontent.com" has long been DNS poisoned by
GFW. When a user in China, *nslookup  webcache.googleusercontent.com 8.8.8.8
*(or any foreign IP),GFW will detect this action and return a fake response
which is much faster than the authentic one. The user might be a DNS
operated by local ISP in China. So any DNS server in China will cache the
fake response as well.
But something interesting happened this April.
 If you click
the red dates in April to see the technical detail, you will see that this
domain is still being poisoned by GFW, as can be seen from Invalid Dns
Server Dig Host Ip. However, the responses return by local DNS are valid,
as can been seen from Dig Host Ip.
We observe this phenomenon on multiple google domains, including
 (All local
DNS give correct response)
 local DNS give correct
 (All local DNS give
correct response. The domain has *never* been successfully poisoned even
though GFW is poisoning it.)
 (only 114.114.114.114 gives
correct response)
 114.114.114.114
gives correct response)
114.114.114.114 a public DNS operated by tencent- a large IT company in
China, rather than local ISP.
 (No local DNS gives correct
response. This should be the standard behavior)
However, other domains, including facebook and twitter are still poisoned as usual. In other words, local DNS
will cache fake responses.
We want to ask why such phenomenon happened. Because if we can make use of
it, we can un-poison domains. Together with https, GFW will become useless.
One hypothesis is DNSSEC. As the recursive DNS inquiry route is secured(
 from ". to com"
but not "com to googleusercontent.com". So if GFW poisons the response
before the last step, DNSSEC might prevent the poisoning if the user
supports DNSSEC. However, accoding to this logic, youtue.com(or any .com
domain) should not be poisoned either
 So we have no idea if this
phenomenon is related to DNSSEC at all. This phenomenon only happened on
April, while DNSSEC implementation on root server happened long ago.
Or is it related to whether the domain uses cname or A-record?
If we can make use of it, we can potentially destroy GFW in a single
strike. So please help us get to the button of it.

server, the server then would need to decrypt it before encrypting it to

being added to the mailing list (thereby getting all emails) or someone
on the mailing list sending mails outside or betraying people (which
never happens).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Default clients to be non-exit relay LibTech x 
Honestly, I suspect that if the 500k-900k users that Tor has every day
became middle nodes or bridges, it would probably overload the network.
Not that directory authorities couldn't handle it (though sometimes I
wonder), but then each end-user would have to download a far larger list
of relays before using Tor.  For someone using a bridge to connect, the
latency could reach Pyongyang levels :P  Theoretically, the directory
authority could serve up a set of a thousand random nodes, and then the
client software could select a random set to use initially.
  It's an interesting architecture problem.
  Beyond that though, geography is problematic.  How does the network
restrict nodes coming from hostile geographic areas, without notifying
the authorities "Hey, this person is trying to help others bypass
censorship" ?   Maybe an intermediate step would be to offer two browser bundles for
download -- one configured to be a bridge or middle-hop, and one that is
just a client.

tiny data point tying you to a given VPN, it would be hard to prove that

for all of your traffic, it becomes fairly trivial to identify the
source.  Deniability is dead.  And this is especially true in areas
where  need not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that a
specific individual is doing .  Secret police don't have to
prove that a single person wrote something against  -- they'll
just narrow it down to a handful of possibilities and start arresting

Hi all,
  Made this extension for Google Chrome to extend the concept of the Flash

cause a bunch of fairly robust bridges to be made).  The concept could be
used in addons for FireFox, Opera, or Safari as well, since they all allow
processes to run in the background.
* Allows people to opt-in to becoming flash proxies, rather than current
opt-out model
* Works in Chrome OS
* Takes all guesswork out of making a bridge
* Flash proxies made with Cupcake have a substantially longer uptime than
those using site visitors
* Uses less memory than either Tor BB or Vidalia
Source code: Now that I've tested it and it seems to work well, I'd love to get input
and suggestions on it. If it's useful, I'll submit it to the Chrome Web

very straightforward for video games, but Tor is a very complex set of

to push broken-on-purpose, backdoored code to users.

That seems like an intended side effect of what's happened to Jake
Appelbaum, but I go back and forth on whether it was successful or not.
As for the next ten years of Tor... more widespread adoption?  I can easily
see it expanding far beyond capacity.  I can also see it expanding capacity
with the help of average people and awesome hackers.
Pluggable transports are going to become an even bigger deal than they are
now =D

I still can't support people using them, even with Tor and PGP-encrypted
emails. By being a free user, people contribute to their market share and
overall bottom line.
The last email I made with Tor was using Lavabit.com and the experience was
overall quite good =)

@_subject: [tor-talk] How easy are Tor hidden services to locate? 
If a given service allows uploads, for example, it's frequently possible
to then upload something to broadcast the server address.  But if a server
is unpatched, or someone has some Apache 0day they've been saving up, it's
pretty easy to determine the location that way as well.

  Versioning is a weird thing. George makes an interesting point -- i can't
even recall what the current Tor version offhand, and I use it in some
fashion every day.
*I first used Tor sometime in 2005, which seems like just a few years ago,

That is awesome. This is way way off topic, but it must be cool to have
that level of experience.  Not only have you seen the tech develop into
something amazingly useful (and usable!), but it becomes apparent that
government censorship (etc) ebbs and flows as time goes on.
  I get into some interesting discussions about censorship and pop culture
because people frequently peg me as being a teen. "I'd really love to pick
your brain on this TOM-Skype problem -- you can bring your parents or a
friend if you want."

Hi Christian!
  I don't have firefox on this computer right now, but I just wanted to
pipe up and say that this is cool. There are some ways in Firefox to run
pages in the background while the browser is open. If your extension hasn't
incorporated that ability, it is worth looking into =)

version of Cupcake for a while, but is a bit on the backburner at the

That drives me slightly crazy. This has been across lists a few times

doing things to confuse people, whether it's intentional or not.  And to be

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't connect to 
I've had good experiences with Lavabit, but I keep hearing that they may
move to block Tor users because of abuse.  Others report good things with
Yahoo, but I've had an account blocked in the past. (Probably they had
abuse on one IP and decided to block all accounts using that one IP).
  I've also used GuerrillaMail.com, but it's not that useful for
day-to-day.  If you want to use GuerrillaMail for receiving anonymous
emails, start with a long random-ish string for your email and then create
aliases. Accounts aren't password-protected, so if you don't encrypt email
contents, they're readable by anyone who guesses your address.
good luck!

  Flash isn't even as useful as current alternatives (webm ).
You could make the case that Flash allows for amazing video games, but
that seems like the perfect use-case for high-throughput/low-lag VPNs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about possible increased risk of censorship 
The network is pretty visible.  China seems to actively be seeking out
bridges anyway [1] (and I would assume that this applies to other
oppressive countries as well). So if your bridge would otherwise be
private, rolling up a TorCloud instance instead is a solid choice.  If
you're running it from your home network, maybe check to see if your IP
address is the same as it was before (if possible)?

If all you need is html, css, and images, then I'd recommend using
BlueGriffon and avoiding a CMS.  Your hidden service will run faster and
you eliminate the risk of database injection or CMS vulnerabilities.

Disagree to some extent. You don't want to pull in a bunch of scripts,
fonts, or images hosted off-site.  There are some interesting usability
considerations when making a hidden service.

@_subject: [tor-talk] You could use ModX to create .onion sites, 
Bingo.  A lot of sites take ten forevers to fully load because they're
using a free site template that uses a lot of images, or (say) wordpress
with a theme from their repository.
  There's probably a case to be made for image-blocking extensions enabled
by default.  I used to have an extension enabled, and the speed gains on
hidden services were enormous.

Agreed. People are jerks sometimes. =/
  If someone is noticing a trend where their exit is consistently doing

iptables.   Kind of surprised that Linode allowed a tor node to run in the
first place.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Portable & Mozilla Add-ons 
Honestly, I would use a VPN like proxy.sh or buy private proxies (to then
use with an extension like FoxyProxy).  Proxies and VPNs frequently "fail
open," meaning that you don't realize that it has failed since you're still
able to visit websites.  Public/free proxies and VPNs are especially
problematic.  If you're trying to bypass a content filter on a website like
YouTube, a VPN makes sense.  But if you're subject to censorship in your
country, or are an activist, or have serious privacy concerns, Tor is a far
better choice.
BUT, to answer your original question, the easiest way to add extensions is
to just navigate to the FireFox extension website and add them from
there.[1]  Alternate: download the extension (it's an "xpi" file), then
drag and drop it onto an open Tor Browser Bundle window.  You can also
import bookmarks.[2]
