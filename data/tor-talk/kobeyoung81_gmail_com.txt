@_subject: Google Summer Of Code - Orbot 
Hi every one,
Sorry to bother you guys in the mailing list. Can anyone tell me the
current status of Tor Android client Orbot and further development
plans? I'm an Android student developer with one year experience. I'm
currently working as an intern in a company designing a weightloss
robot based Android system. I'm very interested in this Android
client. Any info. or help will be appreciated!
Thank you very much.
