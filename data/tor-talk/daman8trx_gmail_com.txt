I have tor bundle version  2.2.39-3 and I understand that 2.2.39-4 was
recently released. I wanted to know how to go about updating to the
new version. Will I mess anything up if I just download the new
version and replace the old or should I uninstall the old completely
then re-download the tor bundle again. Please help as I love the tor
project and I don't want to corrupt the file and I'd like to continue
surfing safely. Please help.
Kind Regards

Thnx for responding so quickly!... To make sure I understand perfectly well and don't screw anything up!... I delete the ENTIRE tor bundle file off my computer the just download and extract new one and DO NOT just download new file on top of old one!... Is that correct! Thanks again for ur help!...
