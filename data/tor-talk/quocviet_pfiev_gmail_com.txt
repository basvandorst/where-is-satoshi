I'm now researching an attack against Tor.
*Resume of Attack*: We control exit node and entry node. Upon receiving a
RELAY BEGIN cell,the exit node will forger  a malicious webpage to client.
The webpage contains some empty gif files. The entry node will be able to
detect a distinctive pattern of the connection to that malicious webpage,
basing on number of relay cells backward and forward.
For more details, the paper is here:  ( from
For implementation, it's needed to modify a piece of Tor source code at the
exit node, to forger a malicious webpage to client. Notice that this is not
modifying webpage response from the server, but forger attacker's webpage to
the client. Could some one please give a hint about where I need to modify.
Thank you.

Thanks Robert.
I know that there was several attacks with control of both exit and entry
And I just want to test that attack and evaluate its effectiveness.
