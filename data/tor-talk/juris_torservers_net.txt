@_subject: [tor-talk] Who do I ask about purchasing additional Tor 
Hey Virgil,
we have just produced a lot of organic cotton T-shirts in different
colors and sizes with this logo:
So if the Torproject can't help you out, we would be happy to send you
some. (25USD/20Euro each).

Hi Robert,
About our T-shirts:
The profit from every sold T-shirt will be used ONLY for Tor bandwidth.
For nothing else!
About the quality:
Yes, the T-shirts are long lasting. We used organic cotton and
waterbased silk screen printing. The T-shirts are produced fair in
Turkey and are GOTS certified.
I was disappointed from the "fruit of the loom" Tor shirts, so I
searched for something different.
I'll update soon our website with some pictures.

I'm just running some test with a banana pi and it's too early for a
final conclusion, but I don't see any disadvantage compared to a VPS.
The estimated bandwidth is 5TB/month. I guess this is helpful for the
network. Right now it's just a middle relay.
Detailed results will be available in early January.

it seems that Fox doesn't like Tor users.
You could try it with a new identity, cause not every exit is blocked.
I was successful after a while.
Or stop reading Fox crap ;)

That has nothing to do with facebook. You can still create a fake
