Hi everyone!
My name is Fallon. I'm a second year CS master's student at UCSD.  I'll be
working on making improvements to Tor's path selection, with Mike Perry as
my mentor. My abstract can be found here:
I'm excited to be working on Tor this summer. I really appreciate the
opportunity to work on Tor in GSoC, so I'd like to say a big thank you to
those of you who helped organize/are mentoring. I don't have a lot of free
time this week, but next week I'll definitely be in  on freenode to chat
if any of you have thoughts on my project :)
Also, congratulations to my fellow GSoC'ers--as Sebastian said, let's hack!
