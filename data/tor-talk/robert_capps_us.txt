@_subject: tor traffic ratelimiting 
Hash: SHA1
You followed in my mis-steps upon setting up my first node.
kB (kilo-byte - the big 'B') does not equal kb (kilo-bit - the little  'b').  Tor bandwidth limiting is measured in Kilobytes, bandwidth is  measured in Kilobits.
If you are trying to keep bandwidth burst to 128kb, then you will  need to set your BandwidthBurst to 16KB.  (16 KB x 8 bits/byte = 128kb)
Along the same line, your BandwithRate should be 8KB if you wish to  rate limit to 64kb.
Hope this helps!

@_subject: Servers and the "Named" flag (was Re: time needed to register a serve) 
Thanks for clearing this up!  :)
Am always good for a nudge now and then.
I'll keep an eye on or-dev for the discussion.
If that happens, I'll have to find and pay a 5th grader to help me  out.  ;)

Funny, I was just coming to post this same question :)

Interesting, while the server config page clearly says the email may  not be answered, it does not indicate that the email will most likely  never be ACTIONED.
If it is the intention to not register names for servers, then that  should be clearly stated in the Server configuration guide.  It  sounds like it's time to delete Step Four: 'Let us know about your  server', since for all intents and purposes, the feature has been  I for one would like to see some protection given to the names  assigned to long-term stable routers . . . but that may just be a  personal preference of mine, I like to know which server ops take the  time to actually register their servers :)

@_subject: Ports 443 & 80 
I've not tried to setup a TOR node with your config, but I'll tell you  how I got mine to work :
Assumptions for the following configuration:
   1.1.1.1 - Public IP address of Firewall (assumes you are using NAT     2.2.2.2 - Private IP address in use on the TOR server
   :9090 - Private OR Port
   :443   - Public OR Port
   :9091 - Private DIR Port
   :80     - Public DIR Port
First I set my firewall up to accept the following external ports, and  forward them to the TOR server - basically port forwarding with NAT:
   1.1.1.1:443 -NAT and port forward to-> 2.2.2.2:9090
   1.1.1.1:80   -NAT and port forward to-> 2.2.2.2:9091
The TOR server was then configured to listen locally for TOR traffic  on 2.2.2.2:9090 and 2.2.2.2:9091, so you'll need to set the following  items in your torrc file:
    The IP or FQDN for your server. Leave commented out and Tor will     Address 1.1.1.1
    Required: what port to advertise for Tor connections.
   ORPort 443
   ORListenAddress 2.2.2.2:9090
    Optional: what port to advertise for TOR directory  connections.Uncomment this to mirror the directory for others.
   DirPort 80
   DirListenAddress 192.168.3.20:9091
So, without validating your firewall setup, I would think you need to  modify your 'ORListenAddress' and 'DIRListenAddress' to reflect the  ACTUAL IP address (not 0.0.0.0) of your TOR server, and set your  'Address' value to the actual public IP address of your firewall  (note, no port required on the 'Address' value).
Hope this helps!

Oops, the DirPort section of the sample should have read:
    Optional: what port to advertise for TOR directory connections.
   DirPort 80
   DirListenAddress 2.2.2.2:9091

@_subject: Reregister after key change? 
Based on a thread from last October, I don't believe they are  registering 'named' nodes anymore.
I think the loss of the 'named' status is the worst part of the key re- gen process - for those of us that run legacy, named nodes.
Now, time to roll keys on my nodes . . . .
