@_subject: [tor-talk] how to stream videos using Tor 
For youtube, you can go to  and enable the
html5 player.  You will need to set noscript in your browser to enable
javascript from the youtube domains.  You may also have to reload the page
once or twice to get the videos to play.  Videos that require Adobe
Flashplayer will not work in the Tor browser.
