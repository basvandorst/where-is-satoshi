@_subject: [tor-talk] unbound, ttdnsd and DNSPort config 
After trying to configure unbound and ttdnsd for transparent DNS
resolution through Tor, there are a couple of things I can't seem to get
working. Perhaps someone on the list can provide a hint?
I'm trying to set up unbound (running on 127.0.0.1:53) to use DNSPort
(127.0.0.1:8853) and then ttdnsd (127.0.0.2:53) as a fallback.
Here's a snip from the unbound.conf:
 	name: "."
 	forward-addr: 127.0.0.1 at 8853
 	forward-addr: 127.0.0.2
Used individually, the addr directives work fine and resolve using their
respective mechanism. Used together, it looks like ttdnsd never gets a
chance after tor has failed (e.g. when resolving a SRV or MX record).
Any ideas?

@_subject: [tor-talk] ServerDNSRandomizeCase and GoDaddy 
A couple of days back GoDaddy did something to mess up the neat 0x20
hack. Now all answers are lowercase:
$ dig GoDady.com ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
godady.com.		3600	IN	NS	NS45.DOMAINCONTROL.com.
godady.com.		3600	IN	NS	NS46.DOMAINCONTROL.com.
You would kind of hope that a CamelCase named company would get this
right :)
What impact will this have on the tor ServerDNSRandomizeCase option that
defaults to 1 according to the docs? I'm assuming it will break it?

Hehe, didn't even notice the misspelling myself. So there might not be
any affiliation between GoDaddy and domaincontrol.com. after all. I
don't know.
There are still a lot of names on domaincontrol.com though (a lot of
them with GoDaddy as registrar). Here is a new example [1]
$ dig WiMp.com ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
wimp.com.		3600	IN	NS	ns03.domaincontrol.com.
wimp.com.		3600	IN	NS	ns04.domaincontrol.com.

There are a bunch of free services that offer temporary mail accounts for
this purpose. One I've used this one a few time:  You would of course have to take steps to protect your identity when
communicating with Mailinator.
