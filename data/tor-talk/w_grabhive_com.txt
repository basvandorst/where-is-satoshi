What is the status of Hidden Service development, at present? Are there still no developers?

So if I could somehow convince the network that my nodes were the fastest, I could capture all of the Tor traffic?

Doesn't that seem something that a network of telecoms in cahoots with a global, quasi-governmental intelligence apparatus could pull off, without much stress?
And worse, doesn't the above imply something close to the capability required to achieve monitoring of the entire network at once, thus de-anonimizing Tor and fully terminating its (presumably) present benefits?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Introducing Tor.framework 
Hi folks,
This may interest developers on the list.
Tor.framework is a new Cocoa framework that allows developers to write apps for Mac OS X and iOS that work over the Tor onion routing network. Tor.framework uses the standard Tor daemon, and serves a small and tidy API for developer use.
Tor.framework's first application is as the backbone of a new Mac Bitcoin wallet app called Hive, which will be released soon at The source is available here:
And support is available via GitHub issues and this Bitcointalk thread:
A sample GUI app, a Tor-only web browser, is also included:

I have setup completely open Tor WiFi hotspots in both my home and my office. They are labeled "%SSID% (Tor)" to give advanced users the idea, but I'm doing no more than that. The bandwidth overhead is manageable and the risk to me is of course minimized. IMHO all hotspots should come pre-configured like this. If they did, we would have many more open networks and perhaps much less of an excuse to aggressively filter known Tor IPs.
