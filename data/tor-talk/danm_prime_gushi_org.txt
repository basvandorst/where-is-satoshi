@_subject: Multi-root DNS is real. 
True enough, but in setting your nameserver to a DNS server which is configured to hand off the one true (tm) root-servers.net zone -- PLUS the .onion zone, is harmless enough, and can be done on both individual pcs, or on things like linksys routers.
The main problem with alternate namespaces as per Paul Vixie, et al, is that it steps heavily on things if other TLD's are ever adopted.  I don't ever see .onion being adopted by anyone else.
The real question here, of course, is what happens if someone DOES somehow get .onion officially delegated to them.
As for using it with Tor?  Well, keep in mind that now all your DNS queries are being sent along to that new resolver, and your actions can be tracked that way unless you're using privoxy to do the resolution directly, which kinda cancels out the privacy thing.

Personally, I like the alternate side of this service -- the access to hidden tor services.
With recent legal developments in the US, some very interesting sites -- even those which are text-ONLY have gone away.  The draw of being able to offer existing threatened sites an alternative is a good thing (along with careful auditing and accounting of said sites to make sure no obvious clues as to the actual server location are left).
It could make paid-tor access very feasible, indeed.
For example, a tor-ized mirror of a "fetish stories" site, if the mirroring was automatic, might be stupid and mirror the thing from its own public IP (thus giving its location away), instead of more properly mirroring the site THROUGH tor (or some other anonymous proxy service).
I love tor, personally, but I'm daunted by the number of pieces of software I've had to set up to get it to work.  I *really* think the necessary element here that stops things is the lack of a single-shot "Of course she's gonna be upset!  You're dealing with a woman here Dan, what the hell's wrong with you?"

@_subject: Easy Installer for TOR 
Hey guys,
I recently installed TOR and was rather impressed by how several pieces of software work together (privoxy, firefox, TOR, the little firefox plugin for proxy configuration).  I was wondering, however, if it was possible to have a "meta-installer" check versions, fetch all the various components, and configure them on the fly.  This same installer could then also function as an auto-updater for all installed softwares.
I know there's a contest going on to come up with a GUI, but I think this installer is equally important.
I know the OSX installer includes privoxy, configured.  Why not the windows version?
As much as I'd like to see everyone be AWARE of how this stuff works, most of the people I know are more interested in the end result.

You can certainly use https, and port 443.
That said, the certificate naming scheme may be way off, since there's no concept of a valid certificate (I doubt verisign will want to sign one for 786237261871621.onion :)
However, assuming the user installs your self-signed cert, it *should* work the same unless there's something I'm missing.)
Of course, you're really just protecting content from being sniffed between the user and the entry node (usually, the same machine, but not always), and the exit node and the hidden service (presumably, you control This is my understanding of it -- if someone has a better one please step on me without hesitation :)

The other thing that could be interesting of course is an onion-only search engine, which could either compliment or reduce the need for vanity Still, I don't see why the directory servers can't maintain this info.  It would have to (for the most part) be first-come first-served, and I suppose some sort of uptime monitoring should also play a part (i.e. if you don't use it for say 6 months, you lose it).
Shame there's not a whole lot of clients that make use of SRV records, as an onion specifier in there could prove remarkably useful in some way.

You may also want to take a look at Thomas Boutell's excellent rinetd program, which is a more userspace example of what you want -- except that with the IPFW answer, the thing will see the original source IP (not that it really matters in the case of TOR)

@_subject: FW: [Full-disclosure] Tool Release - Tor Blocker 
This is an apache module?  It's staticly coded, whereas the nature of tor exit nodes is that the list will change.  And this 403 would just tip-off would-be "hackers" to use another method of circumvention.
What could be far more useful is a simple bash/perl/whatever script to pull in the list of tor nodes and drop them into a .htaccess file or, better, a firewall rule.
That is, of course, assuming we're into blocking anonymous nodes as opposed to actually running secure machines.
If your machine is listening on a public IP, and can be "hacked" on a completely valid TCP connection (which is the only kind TOR allows -- leaving out most of the tricks "hackers" use), then you've got bigger problems then tor.

The webserver will see the IP of the "exit node" which is usually an IP on the same server.  Running a hidden service gives you no more insight into a TOR user's identity than being a standard node.

@_subject: Speak of the Devil 
A few varying thoughts here:
I can't speak for the british government, but if someone came to me and said "someone is using your SSL-enabled webmail system to traffic kiddie porn" and felt that somehow the easiest way to sniff their traffic was with my private key (as opposed to just asking me to tap their spool dir, tar up their homedir, and gladly hand over any information associated with them), I'd be more than willing to cooperate.  With probable cause.  I know warrants are difficult, but I come from a law enforcement family.
Sadly, the truth here is that if someone is using my server, then the fedgov HAS to act as if I am in on this, and will likely blow their investigation if they contact me -- at least this is how procedural rules are set up for them.
I've investigated kiddie porn complaints on my network, and let me say this in total seriousness -- while we've all seen the maxim-like young looking models that are just recently 18 (hell, they advertise on regular cable here in the states)...every once in a while you come across a site like the ones in question that is so blatant, so disgusting -- where there's no question in your mind that yes, that's thirteen.  Following that, there's a fit of nausea and a willingness to research some drug or amount of voltage that can remove the images you've just seen from your mind.  I'm told the sensation is about ten times worse if you're a parent.
With that said, however...
There's nothing stopping governments from logging the traffic (possibly at a higher level, like the upstream level) and then getting a subpoena for whatever key was used to encrypt it.
The PROBLEM with this method is that once the length of the warrant has expired, 99 percent of people out there DO NOT check CRL's.  I myself am guilty of this.  I.e. once the government HAS your key, they've got it for the lifetime of your cert -- and while you can certainly retire that cert from use, there's no way to prevent the now-compromised cert and key from being used creatively for the remainder of the validity period.
Or am I wrong here?

Bind your apache instances to an RFC 1918 address, internally.
Use your kernel's ip forwarding functionality, with freebsd this would be done by a rule like "ipfw add 400 fwd 192.168.1.20,80 ip from any to realip 80"
Alternatively, stick it behind thomas boutell's excellent rinetd -- either approach will "nat" the request and rewrite the tcp connection without revealing that it's being rewritten.

although, be forewarned, at least with the kernel answer above, if the address is on the same machine, you *will* see the source side of the TCP connection.  This is a "feature" of BSD's forwarding mechanism -- so rinetd may be better suited for this.  I had thought that you simply wanted a web server to not know which address it itself was listening on (which also works for this).
