@_subject: [tor-talk] Hulu now blocks Tor 
I run an exit node and when trying to get access to Hulu+ support told me
than in my case they can't whitelist me. Sadly, I'm upgrading to a business
account with my ISP so I can run my exit node on a dedicated IP and my
normal network traffic on another.

It doesn't look like anyone very knowledgeable about tor is commenting and
NH is an audience that would benefit and benefit us from having some facts
checked or knowledge shared.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Block List 
I'm a Charter customer, both residential and commercial and haven't found
any blocked sites or addresses. *maybe* I had an issue connecting to the
tracker at openbittorrent.com but that seems to be resolved now.
P.S. Some sites like the Arch Linux wiki and atlas.ripe.net have issues
when accessing them via IPv6 and the 6rd setup that Charter provides but I
think that's an MTU issue on my side of things.

I'm not affiliated with Tor but did just see a bunch of projects pop up due
to the Google Summer of Code. You might check
 for some
ideas near the "Project Ideas:" section.
