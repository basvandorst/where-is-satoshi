Hello all,
I was just linked to an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education about
An assistant professor at Bowling Green State University is confronted by
the university's network people about his use and advocacy of Tor. He's a
bit lax with the technical details, but it's interesting to see Tor in a
mainstream publication :).
