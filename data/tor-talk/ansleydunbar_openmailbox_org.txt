I agree-- but I don't think it's a fully-fledged, far-fetched conspiracy Tor has always been in and out of the news, sure, we all know that too well, but lately with the endless headlines of FBI! Child porn! Sex offenders! Gotta-catch-em-all! the media-hype-machine has all but cemented the idea that Tor = pedophiles into the minds of anyone who doesn't know better. These allegations about Jacob fit perfectly into that narrative. A cesspool for the sexually-deviant must have a sexually-deviant ring-leader, right?
And not to single out GCHQ- because I'm sure the following is a common tactic- but it matches their old-ass model of "InfoOps" or using "Online Covert Action" to "make something happen in the cyber or real world" with the "~*~*~*~4-D's~**~*": Deny/Disrupt/Degrade/Deceive. (Decorative emphasis added by author)
This is all so fucked up. I feel terrible for him.

@_subject: [tor-talk] doing a google search creates a 403 forbidden when 
I don't entirely understand-- the problem was that Google was preventing
you from accessing any link to the program by denying the search request
altogether, right? And the fix was... finding it off Tor?
After your first email I tried a few different search variables to
duplicate the 403 error, but they were all successful.

Oh you know, just your run-of-the mill program created during a 48-hr
time-frame, no big deal.
Well done, Flipchan, this looks cool- I look forward to checking it out.
Thanks for sharing!
