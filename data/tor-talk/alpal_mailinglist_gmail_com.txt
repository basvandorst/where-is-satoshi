I really like the Request-Policy plugin too. Quite amazing how many
other sites some reference.

Probably because your exit node is being used to do something that
warrants an abuse report.
Stop the activity on your exit node that is causing them to lodge reports?

FWIW, Shadowserver have a reputation of being very good at what they do.
I would have thought abusing the tor network was highly discouraged
too? If people insist on using it for spam and god-knows-what else,
what other choice is there? Unfortunately if people continue to abuse
it, it just stops people who otherwise would from running an exit

Why would you want to do that? The point is someone is using an exit
node for abuse. If you just prevent abuse to a honey pot, you are just
covering up the problem - real servers will still be the recipients of
the abuse?

@_subject: How does TOR deal with mac addresses 
Where exactly do you think the MAC address would get recorded? Your
MAC Is only sent on your local LAN segment? i.e. your MAC only gets as
far as your home router, and then your home router's MAC only gets as
far as the ISP's end point... etc...

Is it worth adding a captcha to bridges.torproject.org? Incidentally,
what happens when "adversaries" just block access to that site?
How about responding to bridge request emails with a captcha style
email attachment with the IPs of bridges?
That would kill any automated attempt to scrape the bridges?

@_subject: Tor Exit Node Sponsorship - looking for partners 
Any new nodes are great, but it does seem like the best option might
be to get people to donate to a pool of money, from which a number of
smaller servers are paid for. Ideally also, there would be a pool of
admins, so a different person could run each node (or at least a few
nodes of the larger pool)?

I will try and spur some discussion :)
I'm not also sure that forcing connections to the tor port will work. Take for example an http request... you are now forcing that to a tor port, which wants to talk socks right? I would have thought you would need some sort of transparent http proxy setup which was configured to use tor for its external comms?

I have been searching the documentation and Internet for days on this
setup. Let me give some background first.
In this network (172.16.10.0/24) I have a couple of clients. Their
default gateway is 172.16.10.1. This system is a Linux server.
The Linux server has a LAN IP of 172.16.10.1 and a "WAN" IP of
10.0.0.23. This server is also running TOR. The "WAN" IP address of
this system is actually being NATTED again by a firewall to an
external IP address.
I want all traffic on the 172.16.10.0/24 network to use this Linux
server as their default gateway. In that gateway, I want IPTables to
send all of the traffic from that subnet through TOR.
If use IPTables to NAT the addresses like this:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state
RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
General network connectivity works.
If I introduce TOR with IPTables like this:
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040
iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9040 -j ACCEPT
TOR connectivity works from the Linux server, but all of the clients
on the 172.16.10.0/24 network no longer work at all. No NAT to the
general Internet, no TOR, no nothing.
I'm thinking this may be an IPTables problem, but I wanted to post
this to this list just to see if anyone else has accomplished such a
setup. If you have, please let me know what I may be doing wrong. If
you need more detailed information, please ask.

That's a very good point klaus.
Joe - if you think the US Government is one big cohesive entity that funds
projects consistently from a single pool of resources and money then I would
politely suggest you may not have had much to do with them :P
