If you showed a caveman a linear polynomial then told him to move a term to
the other side of the equation I'm sure he'd come up with all sorts of
interesting methods of doing it.
When you don't have a firm grasp of the constraints of a problem you can
naturally invent an infinitude of weaknesses, improvements and questions.
Start with the basics of your problem spaces (anonymity, 3d graphics and
hardware) then revisit this post in a year or two.

You make me so sad :( You're why we can't have nice things.
Being able to 'replay' messages from a recently deceased directory nodes
opens up new venues for attack.
Directory servers as single points of failure, you might extrapolate that
to routing servers listed in directory servers; Tor wouldn't withstand an
internet-wide shit-listing very well at all.
Of course the security of any p2p network's sybil resilience the scarcity
of certain resources to keep sybil nodes from controlling enough vote
shares to enforce their own reality.
And, so, we arrive at the more fundamental problem: What resource is scarce
for 'attackers' and fits our users models?
Notarization from a real identity provider. [You are a single 'natural
person.'] (Decentralized system delegated authority to centralized system.
No good.)
Computation. [You don't control more computational power than the entire
network.] Bitcoin & *coin uses this, of course, and it appears to be
working. It's kind of wasteful, I appreciate that it works but -man- is it
Reputation. [You did stuff and I liked the outcome, various levels of
indirection. History.] I like these the most. They may be the most
difficult to implement, especially for 'routing packets.'
IP addresses. [Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha.]
I really enjoy this work on Sybil resilience, combining reputation based
'resource limitation' w/ 'p2p PKI':
Grarpamp: it covers this 'network consensus' problem by using a 'p2p PKI'
which signs 'consensus messages' via 'voting' with shared secrets. Nodes
then report either naughty or good behavior, which leads to privileges
being granted / rescinded.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Cryptography] Blogpost: CITAS, 
LE, Gov and private industry have always been bedfellows - they will
continue to enjoy preferential treatment and advanced threat intelligence
whilst sacrificing 'secrecy' both of internal operations and client
information for the privilege.
The gov can get IP addresses for sybil attacks, they don't need to smuggle
honeypots into internal networks to accomplish this.
The problem is that the 'day one' offering is very light, just a honeypot -
after the target is socialized 'day two' 'enhanced feeds' can be marketed
by LE & Gov by turning on the two-way flow of information. Casual erosion
of trust / privacy boundaries.
Which, of course, only further cements the old adages espoused on these

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why corrupt government officials are strongly 
Couldn't resist!
Certain individuals attribute structures that a society naturally evolves
as being somehow directed by an omnipotent actor. This actor is often cast
in the role of tormentor / antagonist.
For you your tormentor is the 'Gestapo government' and what you perceive as
its colluding branches, including *ahem* 'psyops' outfits in the private
You're close, but unfortunately the truth won't appeal to your ego nearly
as much as the classic paranoid scenario you're living.
One tool you might find helpful is to consider the cost of persecuting you
in this way, when the government has cheaper and more effective forms of
silencing dissidents.
As general, more practical, advice, you are well on your way to being
involuntarily committed, if you don't want this to happen you should
probably limit your interaction with your local police department,
especially when you live in a world where all government agencies and Rupert
Murdoch are personally tormenting you.

To add;
It was surprising (to me) that Chaum should be the one to produce the first
of the modern 'solving the key escrow problem' algorithms. Academia has
been ignoring this particular problem for quite a while - I expect that
more proposed solutions will follow, solutions that will be more difficult
to prove insecure...
PT sounds like its rooted in threat models & crypto systems from 10-15
years ago - I'm not sure why anyone would migrate to this system - over
anything presently available (unless everything else is made illegal, of
Check out cMix's 'beta' paper & make attacks as necessary.
Some of Chaum's earlier work involved designing systems with arbiters where
3rd parties could prove evidence of misdeeds - this system, using threshold
secret sharing (right?), doesn't expose the same properties.
Which means that, of course, operators of routers are free to collude and
subject to TAO from various IA.
