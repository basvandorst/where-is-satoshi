I noticed that the Tor Project's 2012 Financial Report from
notes that what appears to be Tor's largest single source of funding is a
$876K U.S. Department of Defense grant obtained via the Stanford Research
Institute that's described on PDF p.11 as follows:
"U.S. Department of Defense Pass-Through from SRI International
Basic and Applied Research and Development in Areas Relating to the Navy
Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance".
Despite this transparency on Tor's own website, Tor's "Sponsors" page at
 currently lists its
largest donor as "an anonymous NGO."
Isn't SRI "an anonymous North American NGO" only in the sense that
Halliburton or Lockheed Martin could be considered a North American NGO?
Is there another explanation for the discrepancy between the website and
the Tor Project's 2012 Financial Statements?
Could Roger or perhaps Andrew offer some details about the Tor Project's
work under this grant?

Thanks; please see Can anyone working for the Tor Project comment on its U.S. Department of
Defense funded activities beyond what appears when searching for

@_subject: [tor-talk] ***[SPAM]*** Re:  Tor and Financial Transparency 
Thanks to Andrew & others for their responses. I inquired knowing the
norms of research funding in computer science, that various other
government agencies have also funded Tor in the past, that Tor originated
with Navy input, that there are easier ways for nonprofits to hide DoD
funding (like the subsidiary corporation reported on the Tor Project's IRS
990s, for example), and so on.
But I asked because this single grant for $876K is a significant portion
of Tor's operating budget, and about a third of the Tor Project's total
operating income in 2012. It's also far more than the the sum of salaries
and travel funding disclosed in its 2012 IRS 990 forms. So it's not a
trivial amount of money and Tor is not a computer science professor at a
university. Also note that I didn't ask about any of the other funding Tor
receives from the U.S. government, which is more accurately disclosed on
the website most people read.
But as someone who has donated lots of bandwidth and other resources over
the past decade or so to the Tor Project, I'm interested to know whether
my contributions to the project might be going into the coffers of an
organization for which a third of its funding (and presumably, its
activities) exist essentially as a black hole. Not knowing where this
funding goes makes it harder to know where my money or bandwidth or code
contributions go.
Hopefully you can understand why someone might wonder in good faith why a
third of the Tor Project's 2012 funding appears to be disclosed only in
PDFs that very few people bother to read (let alone understand), or why
the Tor Project hasn't updated its website to note that its largest
funder--from the tax documents, at least--is a U.S. Navy grant focused on
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance." I accept Andrew's
explanation at face value, but I also think it's fair to say that it's a
significant oversight.
Since Tor itself is used to evade censorship and surveillance and the only
available information about this funding mentions "Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance" in conjunction with the U.S. Navy, I
hope others on the list understand why someone might ask in good faith
what The Tor Project actually does with funding from this grant.
I hope that in the future, The Tor Project will consider accepting funding
from sources that it can speak to in greater detail and that don't come
with the same risk of undermining trust among volunteers and users.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox vs. Tor Browser Bundle release cycles 
The version of Firefox incorporated into the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)
available via torproject.org is currently multiple releases behind both
Firefox ESR and Firefox. The latest-available Tor Browser Bundles
generally include versions of Firefox ESR that do not include patches for
publicly known security vulnerabilities.
That means that unless you're sufficiently skilled to compile TBB's
extensive modifications to Firefox along with Mozilla's current stable
release code, it's likely that *ALL* TBB users will be vulnerable to
multiple serious, known, and publicly patched security vulnerabilities
that have been discussed in public for a popular piece of software with a
huge attack surface.
My own view is that TBB users should consider rejecting arguments like
"TBB's release cycle is only a few weeks behind Mozilla's" since publicly
known exploits are often disclosed, discussed, and patched in Mozilla's
release cycle before updates to Firefox are issued. We have to do better.
Many more TBB users are probably--and in many cases, unknowingly--using
Tor Browser Bundles that are even more out of date than the latest
available from torproject.org and are therefore even more likely to be
vulnerable to Firefox exploits. Most Tor Browser Bundle users probably
don't obsessively check the Tor Project's blog at
 (since notifications of new Tor Browser
Bundles usually aren't even announced on the main torproject.org site) and
may not always benefit from the latest, greatest update notification
The targeting of Tor users accessing tormail.org with Firefox exploits
earlier this year underscores the fact that these concerns are not merely
theoretical or overly-paranoid. Firefox security exploits targeting Tor
users are a problem, and arguing "it was a Firefox vulnerability, not a
Tor vulnerability" doesn't seem reasonable when Tor Browser Bundle
releases that include fully-patched versions of Firefox are rarely if ever
available at any given point in time.
And although there are usually multiple examples at any given time, I
think it's particularly unfortunate that essentially *all* TBB users are
probably still vulnerable to MITM attacks with a bad French SSL
certificate for Google when users of the latest versions of Chrome and
Firefox users aren't. Before that, TBB's Firefox ESR didn't have important
patches to the NSS crypto library that normal Firefox users *did* have for
a while. And so on.
Several weeks may not seem like a long time for users to be running
vulnerable code, but if that's essentially *always* the case, targeting
TBB users with Firefox exploits becomes a lot like shooting fish in a
barrel for a malicious server, since many if not most Tor users use the
recommended Tor Browser Bundle, which an adversary can increasingly bet
will be vulnerable to Firefox exploits that are relatively easy to target.
I'm not suggesting that The Tor Project start taking responsibility for
the security of Firefox itself or address vulnerabilities faster than
Mozilla does. And I still believe that, on average, TBB is more secure
than Firefox for most users most of the time...by a longshot. Supporting
extensive modifications and improvements to Firefox in TBB is a massive
undertaking, and supporting so many platforms on a shoestring budget is
itself a huge accomplishment. As of today, TAILS includes a more recent
version of Firefox code, which is awesome. I hope TBB can move in that
"Catching up" to Mozilla's release cycle for security patches in the Tor
Browser Bundle release cycle should not be impossible. Mozilla doesn't
just spit out binaries for Tor Project staff to decompile and puzzle over
for months before the process of updating the Tor Browser Bundle can
begin. "Catching up" may ultimately require resources that The Tor Project
simply doesn't have, but at some point, users of the latest TBB code are
either vulnerable to publicly-known and already-patched Firefox security
vulnerabilities, or they aren't.
All that is to say that I hope the Tor Project will give greater priority
to harmonizing TBB's security update cycle with Mozilla's. Same-day
security updates to stable releases of the Firefox code in TBB would be
ideal. I understand recent job announcements already reflect greater
emphasis on the Tor Browser Bundle and add-ons, but the current reality of
most users of the latest-available TBB releases being vulnerable to
serious, publicly-known Firefox vulnerabilities most of the time is
What can users do to help?

Thanks for catching my mistake. Firefox ESR 17.0.11 still leaves TBB users
vulnerable to (from

Firefox ESR 17.0.11 indeed turns out (somewhat confusingly) to be
equivalent to Firefox ESR 24.1.1, and the TBB based on ESR 17.0.11 was
released only four days after Mozilla's updates, which frankly deserves
praise. TBB's latest code is only one release behind Mozilla's on security
So I was wrong about precisely how far TBB is behind the latest ESR
release on security patches, but like I said before, at some point the
latest TBB is either shipping known-vulnerable Firefox code or it's not.
 it looks like
Firefox ESR 17.0.11 included security patches from Firefox ESR 24.1.1, so
my understanding is that TBB is at least potentially vulnerable to the
known, patched vulnerabilities in the list above.
Whether it's four days or a few weeks at any given time, TBB users are
still perpetually using vulnerable code that Mozilla has already patched
most of the time. And like I said before, it's likely that most TBB users
are probably using even older and more vulnerable Firefox code.
What do you think users can do to help close that gap?

An adversary could potentially dig through current Firefox release code,
diff it against relevant portions of the code base used to build the Tor
Browser Bundle, and then infer potentially exploitable vulnerabilities
that TBB users might also be vulnerable to.
Adversaries seeking to exploit TBB users might find that to be
significantly easier than finding and exploiting a previously-undisclosed
zero-day Firefox vulnerability--especially since it's reasonable to assume
that the vast majority of TBB users will be vulnerable to security
problems patched in the latest Firefox releases but not yet incorporated
into the latest TBB release.
It's still generally true that the Firefox code shipped with TBB is
potentially vulnerable to "easier" attacks whenever your team (at Mozilla)
has already released security updates that have not yet been incorporated
into TBB.

My point was that users may not be aware of the possibilities of "looking
at checkins, code changes, and binary diffs" even though it can affect
their anonymity quite significantly. It doesn't seem crazy for users to
assume that the latest version of a piece of software based on Firefox
would generally use the latest version of Firefox.
To illustrate why I think this matters in practice, here's some
data--which I should caution may not be 100% accurate since it's mostly
pulled from blog posts and wikipedia--comparing Mozilla release dates with
TBB release dates:
MRD = Mozilla Release Date
TBBRD = Tor Browser Bundle (Stable Branch) Release Date

There was no ridiculously-long delay between Firefox releases and TBB
updates. There have been some delays of multiple weeks for beta/alpha
versions of TBB this year, but that's not reflected above.
But cumulatively, users of the Tor Browser Bundle have had a total of at
least 34 days since January 8th of this year when they've been using old
Firefox code. Obviously, these crude numbers don't address any of the
qualitative aspects of whether vulnerabilities patched were severe or
possible to exploit in TBB.
Having only 34 out of 337 days between January 8th and today where TBB
users were using old Firefox code may not seem so bad (and was actually
better than I expected), but having a 10% chance (on average) of being
potentially vulnerable to bugs that Mozilla has already patched strikes me
as a "low-hanging fruit" sort of opportunity to address for TBB users.
It's also worth keeping in mind that 10% is a minimum estimate for an
average TBB user's risk of using old (and in my opinion, easier to
exploit) Firefox code in TBB, and conservatively assumes that all users
checked for and installed TBB updates every single time they used TBB this
I believe that may be a significant underestimate because I can say
firsthand that using the Tor Browser Bundle in its stock configuration did
NOT immediately notify me that I was using outdated Firefox code during
the time that the FBI was exploiting Tor users this summer. I had been
using an outdated but stock/stable version of TBB without being notified
of available updates until I read about those exploits in the press and
checked the website for updates manually.
Perhaps my experience was unique or users are to blame for their own
laziness in staying up-to-date, but I hope we can agree that making it
easier for TBB users to run the latest available Firefox code 95 or 99% of
the time could still be significantly safer than the status quo, where
unless you build TBB yourself, running the latest Firefox code in TBB is
only possible about 90% of the time.

I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but was hoping to start a
conversation about figuring some out. I was hoping there would be some
value in raising the issue. Understanding *that* there's a problem isn't
the same thing as understanding *why* there's a problem or *how* to fix
it. You're right that the latter two are far more important, but it seemed
worth mentioning even though I failed to devise any solutions myself.
Assuming we agree that a smaller delta is better than a bigger delta,
hopefully there could be a conversation about how volunteers might be able
to help make that delta smaller.
I have no doubt that I am a bit thick at times and occasionally not paying
attention to things, but that's one of the reasons why I think dumb users
like me would be better off if they didn't have to pay *as much* attention
to things like deltas between Firefox and TBB releases. TBB has made
awesome strides in that direction and seems poised to continue doing so,
but my hope was that others in the community would suggest some ways
volunteers might be able to help add to that.

Agree completely, and there are other security reasons--not to mention
NoScript configuration defaults--that also potentially favor
1) signature-based verification of all TBB components at launch,
2) potentially encouraging users to consider multiple TBB installations to
support/encourage compartmentalization, and especially
3) improved user education on the importance of using new identities, e.g.
prominently informing users via check.torproject.org.
Even just the javascript-mediated privacy violations that are possible via
the use of tabs (no Private Tab extension!) in TBB are pretty astonishing.

I'm well out of my depth here in terms of technical expertise so please
take this question with a huge grain of salt, but the dialogue on this
thread makes me wonder:
Should the probably very slim likelihood that someone may have somehow
spoofed Tor's metrics be considered alongside other hypotheses for
explaining the recent stats?
That seems implausible to me (even as a non-technical person), but is such
a "hypothesis" potentially still in the same ballpark of plausibility as
other explanations put forward here?
Hopefully it's clear I'm not trolling or trying to dismiss others' ideas
or data...just trying to hold up a different (and hopefully still
constructive) yard-stick next to what still seems like considerable
uncertainty in terms of explanations for the set of recent observations
discussed here.
