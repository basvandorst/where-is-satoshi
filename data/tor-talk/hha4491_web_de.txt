Hi Leroy,
I did a little testing:
using it after Tor Browser has stated, I get:
... only one in 949,593 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.
Screen Size and Color Depth: 1000x865x24
With full screen I get:
... only one in 1,186,992 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.
shich is not so much more and
Screen Size and Color Depth: 1562x888x24
My preferred window size yields in
... only one in 2,373,988 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.
Screen Size and Color Depth: 1226x884x24
For Opera it say:
... only one in 2,373,991 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.
Screen Size and Color Depth: 1920x1080x24
which is the monitor resolution. The window size has no effect on the For Firefox I get:
... only one in 2,374,000 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.
Screen Size and Color Depth: 1920x1080x24
But for Firefox and NoScript not allowing Java Script I get:
... only one in 87,926 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.
Screen Size and Color Depth: no javascript
Isn't that the best result?

Hi Libertas,
additionally to starting Tor with
...start-tor-browser -allow-remote
you must set Firefox as your preferred browser,
and no other Firefox except the Tor Browser must run.

Hi Drake,
I understand what you are saying. If it helps to be more anonymous that's o, k.
Does that mean if I make the window full screen I'm losing 	 	anonymity?
Just do the following: start Tor Browser, and make the window full screen. Then log out and log in again or restart the PC. The next start of Tor Browser will come up with a full screen window only to switch back to default after a second or two.

when I download Tor Bundle xyz and unpack, it goes into a certain directory (.../tor-browser_de/ in my case) from where I start it. After a while I, and certainly others as well, modify settings, add a start page, import bookmarks etc.
When I download a new version, unpacking wants to put it into the same directory named .../tor-browser_de/ (2). I can start the new version from there, but how do I get all my settings etc. into it?
