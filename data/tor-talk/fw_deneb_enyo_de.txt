@_subject: [tor-talk] Exit nodes generating HTTPS traffic to HTTP ports 
Is there a constellation of bugs which recently conspired in such a
way that a web server might receive a flood of HTTPS requests on port
80/TCP instead of 443/TCP?
I've seen a report about an alleged DoS attack from originating from
exit nodes, and I'm wondering if a bug and sudden interest from Tor in
that website could explain the anomaly.
