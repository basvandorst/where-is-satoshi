@_subject: Recognizable link/button to hidden hosts 
I know there is probably no overwhelming demand for having recognizable links/buttons to hidden hosts.
But you all know those paypal buttons, right? You see them on some random website and instantly know they will take you to paypal.
So if one does setup a hidden service, not because he wants strong security and privacy or something, but maybe just to avoid to
depend on US-goverment-controlled-DNS-and-not-want-to-reinvent-the-wheel or whatever (see the removal of some DNS entries
because of copyright reasons recently)... having an consistent analogy to such paypal links/buttons would be nice. And when such
sites owners could see there is a proposal for a consistent design of such a link/button they would use it. And people who visit
those sites and see such links/buttons everywhere would get more aware of tor.
Of course this doesn't work out for all tor sites. This could be used for sites that do not want to rely on
US-goverment-controlled-DNS anymore.
Right now people are desperate to come up with alternatives to DNS like turning the IP of a server into a sentences with 4 words
from an array of 255 words ( That is just
fragmenting what could be an addition to the tor userbase.

hahaha... that's what they (apache docs team) replied when i told them their documentation is shit and was comparing it to php
docs which are intuitive and awesome... asked them to add a example .htaccess for every damn variable/command they have with a
red frame around it...
they said their docs are so shitty to discourage noobs who would taint apaches reputation... xD

ok... since this mailing list is not able to give at least some tips for running a tor exit node except:
"Do it." or "We do have a lawyer" (how is that supposed to help me?)
I will just ask the german "Bundesamt f?r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik" ( howto setup a TOR
exit node without ruining my life... :D
people here are probably too cool to give noobs instructions...

This stuff: reads all like "How not to get caught".
But I wan't a legally binding statement from a lawyer or an official (BSI) that running TOR exit nodes in germany is legal.
And then I wan't to sink that little money I have into running as many of such servers as I can.

@_subject: Polipo starts on bootup 
afaik polipo is some proxy.. just like privoxy it can be used to invoke TOR... i think it is a little bit smaller than privoxy
or so.. here is a small howto... i just use torify to start processes that should make use of tor... mostly cronjobs.. but that's my setup..

@_subject: How to find exit nodes by location? 
you could run the list of exit node ip's through GeoIP and see which is closest to your desired exit.. i think the
GeoIPCityLite.dat (or so) is available for free too...
here is a tool that reverses the geoip.dat into a list of countries with ip ranges...
  but not sure if it still works...

I'd rather twist this into free promotion for TOR instead of hoping that some random goverment will /not/ do something like this.

So all I need is a competent lawyer to run as many exit nodes as I want in Germany?
Just great... the brainwashing already made me believe that I'd ruin my life if I did.
I'll consult a local lawyer who is a specialist in this field.

It would be very useful to have a factsheet that lists jurisdictions, tor-exit-node related trials and their outcome.. to inform
potential admins about the possible risks..
I wouldn't be interested into starting exit nodes and then give in as soon as there is pressure.. rather ask a lawyer to clean
that up...

since 4GB or 8GB of ram are pretty much the standard these days you could use a ramdisk for swap... ;D

yes... but that's not reassuring enough.. i'll still rather visit a lawyer myself first...
the problem for the most people, who would like to run exit nodes, is their fear because they don't know if they would receive
the german counterpart of just a C&D letter... or if they will get their homes raided and basically get their lifes ruined
forever with the legal fee's alone...
