Hi Scott,
I think that is the wrong question. Online communications isn't what
causes terrorist attacks.
You shouldn't be looking at 'the internet' and Tor as a means of
stopping terrorism...

Both have completely difference scenarios though. Taking down exits
(for what ever reason; 'bad things' coming out it) is one thing. Taking
down multiple servers across different locations I think will prove
more difficult. The effect could also be very different...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about something said about Tor in the Der 
I /think I prefer/ the opposite i.e. your first scenerio; connect to
the Tor network in the usual way...
The problem will still be to differentiate between your Tor node flows
to other Tor relays (and clients? guard node?), and your client Tor flow
to someone elses guard node.
With your second scenerio; are you suggesting you would use your own
node as a permanent guard node?

Assuming someone believes that hidden services has a bad 'reputation',
I'm not sure that because a CA would be willing to issue certificates
for a .onion, that this will provide enough 'credentials' for people to
improve their view of hidden services.
I don't think we should look towards encouraging the use of a CA
signing a .onion. We should be looking towards more decentralized
methods, i.e. (which I'm sure people have read, but quoting none the
the less) the idea that was within Tor's blog post [1]...
"A more thorough approach in that direction is to have a way for a
hidden service to generate its own signed https cert using its onion
private key, and teach Tor Browser how to verify them ? basically a
decentralized CA for .onion addresses, since they are
self-authenticating anyway."
This gives the user some confidence (as they'll see the "https"), and
in my opinion moves away from a broken CA system.

True. It seems /most/ of the conversation for encouraging CA use, is
giving user confidence by having "https" there; which /maybe/ could be
achieved by other means (my previous email RE Tor's blog post). While,
the idea within the Tor blog post is only theory right now (I guess?),
we should be looking at alternatives. I believe a network that
encourages the use of decentralized systems encouraging the use of a
fairly centralized CA system is a mistake; especially when there is
some rough ideas to look into.
In what way does Tor not currently provide 'strong' authentication?
Sorry, I might have misunderstood you.
Not sure I would use DNS as an example of reliable authentication. As
above though, do you think current or future users would be checking
who issed the certificate? I don't think the typical user would. In
that scenerio, I would hope the difficulty in creating a too similar
hidden service address would create enough difference for users to
notice; though I might well be wrong here. But I see your point. :)

I'm not sure that is a fair assumption; Comodo for example. Purely
because today a lot of secure communication relies on CAs, I don't
think is a reason to continue along the same path and not look into
I 100% agree the CA issue is a much bigger one than this conversation,
but the situations *are* different.
Saying that, I do understand the "architectural
considerations" (-Facebook) that some large companies might have.
