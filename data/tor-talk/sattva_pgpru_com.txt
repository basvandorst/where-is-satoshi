@_subject: [Fwd: High-traffic Colluding Tor Routers in Washington, D.C.  Confirmed] 
...However none of the mentioned below router nicknames or fingerprints
was found in the current local cache file.
-------- Original Message --------
A group of 9 Tor routers also functioning overtly or indirectly as Tor
exit nodes have been observed colluding on the public Tor network.
The colluding routers map to two /16 IP subnets administered by Cogent
(formerly by PSINet) [1]. Traceroute reveals all routes to these routers
pass through Rethem.demarc.cogentco.com (38.112.12.190) at the final hop.
Analysis of a local snapshot of the Tor cached-routers file from
2006-05-27 first suggested the presence of colluding routers. The
analysis yielded the following information:
  - 9 Tor routers self-identified as aala, donk3ypunch, TheGreatSantini,
mauger, paxprivoso, soprano1, hubbahubbahubba, m00kie, and joiseytor
together reported carrying what amounted to 11% of the traffic on the
Tor network at the time of the snapshot, while the remaining 89% of Tor
traffic was carried by the other 551 (approximated) routers.
  - All 9 of these routers appear to be located in the Washington, D.C.
  - 5 of these routers are on the same 149.9.0.0/16 IP subnet.
  - 4 of these routers are on the same 154.35.0.0/16 IP subnet.
  - All 9 routers reported running Tor 0.1.0.16 on FreeBSD i386 machines.
  - All 9 routers reported nearly identical uptimes.
  - 3 of the 5 routers on the 149.9.0.0/16 IP subnet reported providing
outproxy service for DNS, HTTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTPS, AIM and IRC traffic
on Tor.
  - The other 2 routers on the 149.9.0.0/16 IP subnet reported rejecting
all outproxy traffic.
  - The 4 routers on the 154.35.0.0/16 IP subnet reported providing
outproxy service for the above traffic plus SSH and NNTP.
Collusion was definitively established by the following method:
1. The following lines were added to the local torrc:
   ExitNodes donk3ypunch,mauger,paxprivoso,soprano1,hubbahubbahubba,
   StrictExitNodes 1
2. The local Tor client was restarted so the new configuration would
take effect
3. Using Tor as an HTTP proxy, the websites of the IP address mirror
services whatismyip.com and whatsmyipaddy.com were visited repeatedly
over the course of one hour
The results: An IP address of 149.9.0.25 was always reported by the IP
address mirror services. This is not the IP address of any of the exit
nodes forced by the new torrc configuration, but rather the address of
aala, one of the 2 other colluding Tor routers which report themselves
as rejecting direct Tor HTTP outproxy traffic.
Although further testing is needed, it appears that all 8 of the other
Tor routers identified may be forwarding their HTTP outproxy traffic to
the router known as aala, and that aala may be performing the exit node
duties on their behalf. aala may perform exit node duties for all
protocols supported by this collusion network--not merely HTTP. This
strategy would make aala a single point of transit (and possible data
retention or traffic analysis) for up to 11% of the traffic leaving and
entering the Tor network through exit nodes.
The function in this collusion network of the router identified as
TheGreatSantini is still undetermined. Its published exit policy, like
aala's, purported to reject all outproxy traffic, yet it hasn't been
observed acting as an outproxy as aala has. It may simply serve as an
intermediate router.
Due to the sheer amount of traffic apparently passing through this
collusion network, consolidation and analysis of exit node traffic is
only one of several forms of anonymity attacks made more feasible. Hence
these 9 routers appear to pose a significant anonymity threat to users
of the public Tor network.

As a side note: In the context of OpenPGP you have to encrypt the same
message (plaintext) with more than 65536 public keys in order to make
things somewhat more appropriate for an attacker. And even that's won't
help him much because of the PKCS padding.

This approach pleases me much more. However HTTPS traffic won't please
such proxy very much unless it can handle it on his own (in MITMish way).
One of existing options for consideration is GPGrelay. It's intended for
mail traffic proxying, but I suppose it's not entirely impossible to
modify it for HTTP traffic (not so sure for HTTPS).
But I see another problem with your proposal -- problem with encryption
logistics if you wish. Suppose we already have such a magic wand for
web-pages transparent client-side decryption (whatever it could be).
Lets say, sender has published a website encrypted to some set of public
keys (excluding his own key for before-mentioned reasons). What if on
sudden he becomes aware of one of the recipient key's compromise? Now
sender needs to decrypt the whole site and re-encrypt it to another set
of public keys, excluding the compromised one to not let an attacker to
lay his hands on sensitive data (if it's not too late already). Problems
  1. How could sender decrypt the website if he doesn't have the
     appropriate private key?
  2. How could be data re-encrypted if not even the sender uploaded it
     (according to some earlier proposal)? He didn't had the plaintext
     in the first place.
  3. How time-consuming could be a task of re-encrypting a large
     website with a lot of pages and how much could go wrong leaking
     the plaintext data?
If my life was at stake, I wouldn't trust it to that sort of things.
And finally there is a gap in the threat model. If we treat webserver as
untrusted (or even malicious) then we can't discard a trivial option of
DoS attack: server (or hosting provider) may simply erase the contents
of the website or block access for legitimate users.

I'm wondering (just wondering, not proposing anything of course)... what
if anon server logs not real but fictional route data? Say, if exit node
instead of logging the real inbound IP of a middleman in the US saves
some arbitrary IP in Uganda or on Toga Islands? You know, many Tor nodes
are transient, some appearing, some disappearing...

WinXP does not have such capabilities built in. The only free and open

is TrueCrypt + TCTEMP (uses boot-time generated ephemeral keys):
Besides that there are a bunch of closed/proprietary software for swap
and/or system partition encryption: BestCrypt and PGP Whole Disk are the
best from my expirience (both are proprietary, BC is partially open for
peer review, PGP WDE is open source, but not Open Source or Free).

Sorry for off-topic, but for the accuracy of further discussion: FAGCI

its personnel and assets where transferred under Federal Security
Service (FSB) command (primarily the beforementioned SORM system and

Joint Staff's Central Intelligence Agency (GRU).
So, all military intelligence gathering and SORM system are now in the

Unfortunately, the problem is bigger than that. Suppose a website that
stores user_login+hashed_password an as authentication token in a cookie
not marked as "secure (SSL only) cookie". If, even accidentally, our
user browses to that site by means of an open HTTP, his browser will
transfer this stored cookie in a standard GET request and make it
susceptible to passive sniffering. Now the attacker can trivially pass
the same cookie data to the website and hijack user's account.

Hi guys,
I'm currently working on the new project of tightly secured collabo-
rative/wiki environment software with some neat features, e.g. GnuPG
server-side integration for users' signatures verification and display
on page revisions, comments and so on. Another major goal is censorship
resistance and fault-tolerance by means of data mirroring between
several similar sites.
As I think many on this list may be interested in such features (say, a
decentralized distributed hidden wiki that continue to serve its purpose
even with one or several hidden nodes goes offline), I would like to
hear also any additional feature requests, recommendations or general
wishes. On- or off-list if you prefer.

Don't forget it shouldn't necessarily be caused by some purposeful
Chinese government's actions to poison the Tor network with 'fake'

China, she will get censored content just because that's what exit-node

"Unauthenticated" reading in Petname tool on a HTTPS site means that not
all webpage contents were transmitted over SSL, e.g. contents is
security-mixed. Consider a scenario with secure site transmitting user
login credentials with help of some javascript code sent over plain
HTTP. If Mellory substitutes this unauthenticated javascript code, your
login information could be compromised. In this case there is no
practical difference would you use Petname tool or not, because not all
webpage objects are safe in the first place.
Usually such "mixed contents" situations originate from ad banners or
some similar things. You may scrub it with Adblock Firefox extention.
When there will left no HTTP-transmitted objects on HTTPS page anymore,
Petname tool will work as expected.
