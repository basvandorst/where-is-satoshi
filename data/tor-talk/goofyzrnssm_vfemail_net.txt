Sophie Hassfurther:
Maybe clicking the online/offline icon at the lower left corner of  Thunderbird between different TorBrowser identities will work.  This  process is based on instructions from Security in a Box [0].
1) Start a new Thunderbird (with TorBirdy) session in `offline mode.'
2) Start the TorBrowser Bundle (TBB),
   2a) Select `test Tor network settings,' and note the IP address.
3) In the current Thunderbird (TB) session,
   3a) Select `online mode,'
   3b) Open TorBirdy Preferences, click through the warning, and then
   3c) Click on `Test Proxy Settings' only.  A new tab opens in TB.
     3c-i) (Close the TorBirdy Preferences dialog.)
   3d) In the new tab, check to see whether TorBirdy's IP address is
     the same as or different than TBB's IP address.
     3d-i) If the two differ, try refreshing TBB.
   3e) (Hopefully) send and receive emails.
   3f) When finished with the particular email account(s) currently
     in use, reengage `offline mode' in TB.
4) In TBB,
   4a) if you've finished entirely then close TBB and proceed to step  5), or, if
     you would like to connect to some additional email accounts using a
     different Tor network path than the previous email account  connections have
     used during this same Thunderbird session, select `new identity.'
   4b) Go back to step 2a) and repeat.
5) Close the current Thunderbird session.
AFAIK this process works (I've checked and the IP addresses matched)  on the same versions of Thunderbird, TorBirdy, and Enigmail as above,  with the Lightning calendar addon.

Realizing that there are many different considerations of which I'm  not aware, (also that this is a feature request of sorts, so please do  point me in the right direction here) I for one would really like to  see TBB automatically translate (for example) "3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion"  into the human readable "DuckDuckGo," perhaps in a similar manner as  with EV SSL cert's, though perhaps only for location-known and  the-content-is-legal-everywhere onion services.
Perhaps some sort of opt-in procedure would be reasonable for those  high-security-yet-not-location-anonymous onion services who really  would rather be more easily identified?  That would save the users'  time of verifying their .onion URL's at least (plus, it could possibly  decrease any phishing / link-jacking opportunities as well).
It just seems like all the information is already there, in the Tor  world, that if .onion site operators are okay with being found  geographically... then why keep their business names hidden from the  browser?  Vote cast.

@_subject: [tor-talk] REAL-ID Internet Access Coming Soon 
The public library where I live (U.S.) allows patrons to use  pseudonyms on its website in order to shield patrons' privacy.  In  2014, Reporters Without Borders scored China at 175 out of 180 as one  of the most restrictive countries on the planet for freedom of speech  [1].  Google+ has let go of its real name policy [2].  Amazon offers  Pen Names [3], and shoppers on Ebay & Paypal appear to be able to sign  up using business names, at least as of 2011 [4].
There already are many professionals who use crypto regularly [5, 6],  although not all say so, and these folks chose to do so of their own  volition.  In the wake of Snoden's disclosures, this looks to me like  a groundswell of support for crypto incidental to the increase of  computer literacy among the general public.  Pseudonyms also have some  historical precedent: Voltaire's real name was Fran?ois-Marie d'Arouet  [7].  That psuedonymity is a very popular approach to achieving  privacy in the West is common knowledge [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14].
If a `REAL-ID Internet Access' law were to gain traction in the U.S.,  how would such a law be enforced exactly?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems? Verifying signatures in Tor 4.0.4 
The more complicated verification gets, the more difficult it becomes  for `the bad guys' to hack your files.  So there's a real benefit to  embracing the advanced verification process.  Learning that process  may take some time, but if you're quite seriously worried, then maybe  it's very much worth doing.  The steps below outline a fairly  anonymous process.  Possibly you may prefer to do all of this  someplace other than at home or work, or someplace where no phones or  MAC addresses have tracked you.
1) Sha256sum verification.
    1)A) From different exit nodes of the Tor network, download from  TorProject [5] three or more copies of each of these files.  To change  exit nodes, click "New Identity" in the TorButton menu.
       1)A)a) [TorBrowserBundle].tar.xz
       1)A)b) [TorBrowserBundle].tar.xz.asc (Note: ".asc" files are detatched
          signatures)
       1)A)c) sha256sums.txt
       1)A)d) sha256sums.txt.asc
    1)B) Compare the SHA256 sums of each subset separately (a, then b,  then c, then d) amongst themselves, and delete the ones that don't  match the others [4].  Re-download new copies if necessary.
    1)C) Check the SHA256 sums of [TorBrowserBundle].tar.xz against  the list sha256sums.txt.  Instructions on how to do this can be found  at Tor's page "How to verify signatures for packages" [3].  (On  Linux/OSX it's easy; maybe it's easy on Windows, too, I don't know.)
2) GPG.  (Note: command syntax shown is for gpg v.1.4.16 on Linux)
2)A) Get from TorProject the first list of keys.
    2)A)a) An easier way is to just download the one signing key,  listed at the TorProject Blog [1].
    2)A)b) The more thorough way is download them all, listed at [2] and below.
2)B) Import into gpg the keys on the first list.
    2)B)a) Just the signing key, listed at [1].
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290
    2)B)b) Or all of the keys listed at [2].
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0x0E3A92E4 0x4B7C3223  0xD0220E4B 0x23291265 0x28988BF5 0x19F78451 0x165733EA 0x8D29319A  0x63FEE659 0xF1F5C9B5 0x31B0974B 0x6B4D6475 0x886DDD89 0x9ABBEEC6  0xC5AA446D 0xC11F62765 0xBE2CD9C1 0xC82E0039 0xE1DEC577  0xD255D3F5C868227F 0x4E2C6E8793298290
2)C) Get from gpg the second list of keys. These are the gpg keys of  individuals and organizations which have signed the TorProject signing  key. In the example below, what you're looking for are the eight-digit  key numbers listed to the left of the term "sig," which is found in  the furthermost lefthand column.
$ gpg --list-sigs 0x4E2C6E8793298290
pub   4096R/93298290 2014-12-15
uid                  Tor Browser Developers (signing key)  sig          63FEE659 2015-01-13  Erinn Clark sig          4B7C3223 2014-12-15  Georg Koppen sig 3        93298290 2014-12-15  Tor Browser Developers (signing key)  sig          1B678A63 2015-02-26  Nicolas Vigier (boklm)  sig          95C877E5 2015-03-01  Paulo Garcia sub   4096R/F65C2036 2014-12-15
sig          93298290 2014-12-15  Tor Browser Developers (signing key)  sub   4096R/D40814E0 2014-12-15
sig          93298290 2014-12-15  Tor Browser Developers (signing key)  sub   4096R/589839A3 2014-12-15
sig          93298290 2014-12-15  Tor Browser Developers (signing key)  2)D) Import into gpg the keys on this second list.
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 63FEE659 4B7C3223 93298290  1B678A63 95C877E5
2)E) Optional.  For verification, re-import all keys from a second  and/or third source.  Additional keyservers can be found online with  some digging.  "PKS" and "site:.edu" are fairly good search terms.
gpg --keyserver keys.mozilla.org --recv-keys 0x0E3A92E4 0x4B7C3223  0xD0220E4B 0x23291265 0x28988BF5 0x19F78451 0x165733EA 0x8D29319A  0x63FEE659 0xF1F5C9B5 0x31B0974B 0x6B4D6475 0x886DDD89 0x9ABBEEC6  0xC5AA446D 0xC11F62765 0xBE2CD9C1 0xC82E0039 0xE1DEC577  0xD255D3F5C868227F 0x4E2C6E8793298290 63FEE659 4B7C3223 93298290  1B678A63 95C877E5
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x0E3A92E4 0x4B7C3223  0xD0220E4B 0x23291265 0x28988BF5 0x19F78451 0x165733EA 0x8D29319A  0x63FEE659 0xF1F5C9B5 0x31B0974B 0x6B4D6475 0x886DDD89 0x9ABBEEC6  0xC5AA446D 0xC11F62765 0xBE2CD9C1 0xC82E0039 0xE1DEC577  0xD255D3F5C868227F 0x4E2C6E8793298290 63FEE659 4B7C3223 93298290  1B678A63 95C877E5
2)F) Verify online the full 40 digit fingerprint(s), or just  `fingerprint,' of the key(s) you've imported.  AFAIK, this can only be  done one key at a time, so it's a little time consuming, but it's  easy.  Verification of the TorProject signing key's fingerprint is the  most important.
2)F)a) Starting with the signing key, 0x4E2C6E8793298290, visually  compare the "Primary key fingerprint" printed in terminal by gpg to  the "Key fingerprint" listed at torproject.org on their blog [1].  The  "Primary key fingerprint" is a 40 digit alphanumeric string: "EF6E  286D DA85 EA2A 4BA7  DE68 4E2C 6E87 9329 8290".  The fingerprints and  their related data should match.  Here are the commands, followed by  how they appear on my machine:
$ gpg --edit-key 0x4E2C6E8793298290
gpg> fpr
gpg> q

gpg> q
2)F)b) Check the fingerprint of the signing key with an online Public  Key Server.  After changing identities in TorBrowser, surf to the key  server of your choice.  An HTTPS connection is ideal here to prevent  any malicious interference.
Once at the Public Key Server's page, select the check box "Show PGP  fingerprints for keys."  Go back to terminal, to the output of "gpg>  fpr", and copy the eight digit key number or email address for the key  whose fingerprint you want check online.  As above:
gpg> fpr
pub   4096R/93298290 2014-12-15 Tor Browser Developers (signing key)  Paste the eight digit key number or email address into the Public Key  Server's search box, and do the search.  If multiple keys show up, the  one key you're looking for should have the full and correct 40 digit  fingerprint listed with it.  Just do a "ctrl-F" search for the full  fingerprint within the page of search results.
Now you reasonably have secondary or tertiary confirmation of the  validity of your copy of TorProject's signing key.  Feel free to  re-check at any time.
2)F)c)  Optional.  Check online the fingerprints of the gpg keys of  the individuals and organizations which have signed TorProject's  signing key.  This step combines together a few of the previous steps.    For ease, you may want to open a text editor to keep a list handy of  the fingerprints you've verified; there's a lot of switching back and  2)F)c)1) Go back to steps 2)C) and 2)D) and get the second list of keys.
    63FEE659 4B7C3223 93298290 1B678A63 95C877E5
2)F)c)2) Next, check in gpg the fingerprint of one of the keys.  In  this example I've chosen at random the first key on the list, key  63FEE659 from Erinn Clark.  Call up in gpg the fingerprint using the  commands in 2)F)a).
$ gpg --edit-key 63FEE659

gpg> q
2)F)c)3) Copy (ctrl-c) the full 40 digit fingerprint from your gpg  results.  Next, go to TorProject's page "Which PGP keys sign which  packages" [2] and search for the same 40 digit fingerprint, in this  example of key 63FEE659 from Erinn Clark.  The fingerprints and  related data between gpg and Torproject should match.  If ctrl-c  doesn't work for you, a visual check works too.
     pub   2048R/63FEE659 2003-10-16
           Key fingerprint = 8738 A680 B84B 3031 A630  F2DB 416F 0610 63FE E659
     uid                  Erinn Clark      uid                  Erinn Clark      uid                  Erinn Clark      sub   2048R/EB399FD7 2003-10-16
2)F)c)4) From here, it's faster to check all of the fingerprints of  the keys from step 2)F)c)1) in gpg and at TorProject, as outlined in  the above two steps, than it is to double and triple check with online  Public Key Servers in serial.
2)F)c)5) Repeat as desired the above steps 2)F)c)2) and 2)F)c)3) to  check the fingerprints in gpg against online Public Key Servers of  your choice, as listed in step 2)F)b).  Remember to use an HTTPS  connection and switch identities between websites.
2)G) Verify that in GPG the detached signatures (.asc) on the  sha256sums.txt and [TBB].tar.xz files are good.  Remember to verify  only files which have already passed the sha256sum verification.   There's been a lot of really good advice on this part of the process  recently, so I'll just show the commands here.
2)G)a) The sha256sums file.
