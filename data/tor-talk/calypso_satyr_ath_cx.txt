I have a problem i do not understand. every twenty minutes tor tells me:
My firewall allows the ports 9001 and 9030 for TCP, and i already tried
to allow it for UDP.
In my firewall logfile (cat /var/log/kern.log | grep DPT=9030) nothing
is written, and i log every dropped packet.
A tcpdump at the time tor prints the message doesn't print any packet to
port 9030.
A portscan (i used heise.de) just of this two ports tells me that they
are open.
A tcpdump at this time also tells me:
does somebody know what is going wrong?

I just tried an update, to 0.1.0.17 , before i used 0.1.0.15, but
doesn't changed anything. Same error, but tcpdump prints me a lot of

In the log there are two interesting messages:

Okay, there are some good news...
Yesterday i got problems with dns-resolving. My dns-servers were blocked
by my "ids-system" (some iptables rules with the recent module). I
implemented some new rules. dns-request now are bypassing the system.
I just checked the logs from tor, and was very suprised. No error, snice
the SIGHUP in the morning, caused by a reconnect of my dsl-connection.
In notices.log.1 I found:
I edited my iptables-ruleset at 22:24, so it really was a (strange) firewall problem.
will keep my eye on it!

Hi folks,
I had some problems with my mailserver, so probably the following
questions were already discussed. If so, I am sorry.
If I am running TOR as a server, and I add the option "bridge relay",
than my server wouldn't be available in the main directory. Doesn't that
necessarrily results in only running a bridge, and not a server any
more, because nobody knows that I am running a server?
Do I have to use port 443? If not, I could offer a high-speed bridge.

Hi Alex,
I am really sorry about what has happened to you.
I think there is a need to incorporate. If there is for example an
incorporated society which runs some tor-nodes, police is going to
confiscate the servers (which is okay), but not going to search houses
from members of the incorporated society.
Also there would be some legal advantages in questions of liability.

Hi Bluestar,
Of course, that is true, and I mention it in the FAQ. But you can ask
every anonymizer on the web the same question. Of course it is better to
use TOR by yourself, but as I said, it is not made for people who can
run their own TOR-Session.
Thanks a lot for that hint, should be fixed now.

No, it does not use a seperate Tor-Client. Therefore it doesn't make

I really don't know, if it will be possible to identify the

Hi Andrew,
thanks first four your long answer!
Although the Layout is much different, you are right, there could be
some confusion. I will add a hint, that it is no official project of
I suppose there is a misunderstanding. I am not logging anything about
the proxy-service (like output of tor, privoxy, etc.). Only logging is
made by a simple counter, included in the frontpage (index.php) for me
to get some informations about how much people are using the service.
There is no possibilty to use the data to find out, which sites users
were accessing through the proxy, and if they were using the proxy at
all. But I suppose it would be possible to change the counter that way,
that it does not collect IP-Adresses at all, or delete it immediatly
after counting the user.
The project works with CGIProxy of James Marshall
(  ). Did you mean that with the
source code, that runs the proxy? Of course I could mention some more technical details like
configuration-files etc.
Yes, good idea. I will do so.
Thinking about using cacert.org as mentioned by Bluestar.
Well, first I will never take money for using that service. I also wrote
that in the FAQ. I think it isn't fair to all the other ones who are
running nodes, and which the service relies on. Second, at the moment there is no need for me to put ads on the site,
because server-costs are okay for me. If service would get very popular,
and server-costs are getting higher, than probably it will be neccessary
to do so, but thats totaly unclear. I would say, we can think about
that, when the moment comes.
Hopefully I answered some questions,

Hi Robert,
Okay, here are how it works.
There is CGIProxy which gets the requests over an SSL-secured channel.
It takes them, and give it to a local squid-instance, which does some
caching to speed things up and take load of the TOR-network. If
requested data is not in the cache, squid gives the request to local
running privoxy, which routes it to the local running TOR-server.
Using privoxy seems to be senseless, but I did not find the possibility
to make squid route to socks.
To prevent any DNS-Leaks, I redirect all outgoing traffic to port 53 to
the dns-proxy of Fabian Keil
(  ) You can see that TOR is resolving DNS, because it is possible to access
Probably I will kick squid out of the setup for legal reasons. I am
currently unsure, if I am responsible for (illegal) content in the
squid-cache. So I have to read up about this.
Do you see anonymity-risks there or have ideas to make things better?
