@_subject: vidalia can't create the circuit. 
Hi all,
     Is it the correct place ask this? I use a linux system. I use the
vidalid connect the network. My tor version is 0.2.1.21.  I can't create the
circuit. The vidalia stop at "Loading relay information". From the log, it
show a lot of below messages:
Notice  I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a
circuit: We have no network-status consensus.
After a long wait......
The log show:
Notice Your system clock just jumped 421 seconds forward; assuming
established circuits no longer work.
I already select the "My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network" and
input the bridge got from bridges at torproject.org.
Any idea resolve this? Tor need any special linux kernel config? If you need
more futher information, I'm very glad to provide.

Hi all,

to or-talk at freehaven.net(which I received some mails) again. Hope this do
not annoy you. I searched the mail list and did not get any related topics
about this problem. Would anyone like to shed light on this issue for me?

The problem occur on my arm based embedded system(I build the kernel and
image myself. Also compile tor source codes for it.). I am sure the network
connection is no problem because the vidalia can work perfectly on my
PC(ubuntu 9.04).
I'm very glad to provide any further information.

Thank you very much!  The vidalia&tor worked now!  Write down the reason
here in case others need:
1. Yes, it is the clock issue! My device date is 2029....
2. "Advanced settings -> Control Port -> Authentication" must set to None.
If use Password with Randomly Generate checked.  The vidalia stopped at
"Loading relay information". Any comment about this? What this password for?
Thanks your excellent work.  I can browse the web(youtube/twitter...)
blocked by GFW with my portable device now!
But facebook still can't. I always get a connection time out.

Hi list,
    I got a warning, "ControlPort is open, but no authentication
method has been configured.  This means that any program on your
computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade
your Tor controller as soon as possible", with my tor and Vidalia. My
tor version is 0.2.1.26. I run tor on Ubuntu9.04. Before this warning
appeared, the tor worked perfectly. What this warning mean and how to
fix it.

Hi Roger,
    Appreciate! I check the password setting in Vidalia. The
"Authentication" is none. On the contrary, I have to set a password.
Then the warning gone. But the connection still failed. I got below
 [Warning] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake
with directory server. (DONE; DONE; count 1; recommendation warn)

Hi list,
    I also have this problem(bridges are blocked) and sent a mail
several days ago.  Now I know what happened. But how to get a *free*
http proxy address? I searched on internet. It seems not easy find a
valid one.
