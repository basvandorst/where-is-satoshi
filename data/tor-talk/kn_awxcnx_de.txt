I agree with Adrew, there is no 100% solution.
But you can do as much as possible to increase your security.
Moving to Linux (or OpenBSD ;-) ) is one step.
Full disk encryption is possible. For Debian or Ubuntu you can enable
full disk encryption at installation time. It does not need any
additional software. (I am not sure about other distributions.)
For WIN you may use Truecrypt or Diskcryptor or other software for full
disk encryption. Since version 6.1 Truecrypt can use hardware tokens
together with pass-phrases.
Live-CDs are a possible solution too.
You may apply many steps and it will be better than doing nothing
because you can not get 100% security.

I tested the latest Dooble release with SOCKS5 proxy (with Tor) and HTTP
proxy (with JonDo) and the preconfigured I2P proxy for eepsites.
It leaks DNS queries and FTP requests in all cases. Yes - it leaks DNS
queries with the preconfigured I2P proxy too. At first the system DNS
resolver (defined in /etc/resolv.c?nf) was asked for *.i2p domains.
The issues are Webkit related. Other Webkit browsers like Google Chrome,
Rekonq and others are affected too.
In my opinion Webkit-based browsers are not suited for anonymous surfing
with Tor or any other anonymisation service.

please post a download link for version 1.35 (Linux64)
I will test it again.
The bug is not solved, only moved to an other bugtracker:
"I'm now moved it to an Apple internal bug tracker. Closing as INVALID
per our policy."
"show IP address on top of the window" was disabled for my test as
recommend by your early post.
But the DNS leak affects all Webkit browser we tested last week. Google
Chrome (Version 21.0.1180.79) for Linux and Windows leaks DNS requests,
Rekong leaks DNS requests... If you were using Webkit without own
modifications I am sure, it will leak DNS requests too.
The DNS leaks are independent of the FTP bug.
HTTP/HTTPS requests are affected too.

Set the following value in about:config

In this case you have only 3 fonts "installed". But the browser uses

JonDonym is a strong anonymsation service like Tor. It is the sucessor
of the project AN.ON of the German universities TU Dresden and TU
It uses fixed routes with mix cascades of 2 mix servers (free cascades)
or 3 mix servers (premium cascades). For encryption of traffic an onion
encryption with AES is used.
The concept you can see at:
  Server operators of JonDonym are certified. You may find a list on the
JonDonym does not get money by governments and does not collect
donations. The service earns money with the premium services, which
offers more speed, more features (SOCKS support...) and higher
anonymity because of 3 mix servers per cascade.
Law enforcement is possible, if all mix operators of a mix cascade
worked together. If all mix operators get an official order, it is
possible to deanonymize single user. For more information see:
  For scientific paper about JonDonym anonymisation technique you may have
a look at:
ANONdroid is working well, like Orbot. But because of the "Google Kill
Switch" I would recommend the using of Lil'Debi (Debian chroot for
Android, you know) togehter with the JonDoDaemon package:

What is a "backdoor":
A "backdoor" offers unrestricted access to the law enforcement agencies
and intelleigence services without support of the service operators.
Such a "backdoor" was built into the Greek Vodafone network for law
enforcement wiretapping capabilities and was requested by FBI director
Robert Mueller from US companies. If Mueller?s wish were granted, the
FBI would gain undetected real-time access to suspects? Skype calls,
Facebook chats, and other online communications? and in "clear text".
Such a "backdoor" is not part of JonDonym.
JonDonym law enforcement:
It is possible, to deanonymize a single user by some features (user IP
address, website monitoring or user account). The idedentify feature for
the malicious user has to be provided by the law enforcement agency and
all operators have to get an official order in their country.
The deanonymisation can only be done by collecting all log together
(usually done by the law enforcement agency), it can not be done by a
single mix operator.
All other user of JonDonym will use the mix cascades without logging.
An scientific paper about the "Revocable Anonymity" impleneted by
JonDonym you may find the publications list at:

You may download Thunderbird for Linux (i686 or x86_64) from:
to your USB-Stick, unpack it and create a small start script
"start_portble_tb.sh" on the USB stick with the following content:
    export HOME="`pwd`"
  ./thunderbird/thunderbird
Make the script executable:
  > chmod + x start_portble_tb.sh
And you have a portable Thunderbird for Linux.
You can download Thunderbird for both architectures (i686 and x86_64)
and use two start scripts for i686 and amd64 PCs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia error message with TorBirdy 
If STARTTLS was enforced for IMAP (port 143) it is safe like SSL for
IMAPS (port 993).
But Tor does not know, if STARTTLS was enforced or only desired in your
Thunderbird configuration. If it was only desired it is possible for an
attacker to disable TLS encryption by override the signal to start the
TLS handshake.
Tor will give you a warning about possible insecure connection. But did
not know if the connection was really insecure.
Latest Thunderbird versions enforce STARTTLS if it was selected. The
weak option "Use STARTTLS if possible" is not available any more in
Thunderbird. You may use IMAP with STARTTLS, if your provider does not
offer IMAPS.
