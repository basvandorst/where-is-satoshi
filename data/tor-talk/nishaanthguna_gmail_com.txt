I am Nishaanth,Undergrad in India.
I would love to contribute to Tor.
But I am stuck with questions like where to start and what should I know.
I can code comfortably with C,C++,HTML and know certain stuff about Python.
It would be really helpful if you can me out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] IRC Connectivity 
I am not able to connect to  via freenode.
It says "This channel is invite-only. You must have an invite from an
existing member of the channel to join."
Any suggestions on what to do?
