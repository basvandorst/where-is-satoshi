Hi all,
I'm looking for a version of the Tor logo in SVG. Anyone have one?
Standard searches have failed to turn one up.

This is really nice! I like it a lot from the little I've played around with it. However, running this under Linux and starting
Firefox from a terminal I gets lots of unneeded/wanted output
in the the console. Ie:
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Rewriting  ->     Forced URI     Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
    Got http-on-modify-request
This actually looks like debug. It would be nice it that disappeared :-).

DuckDuckGo and Startpage.com are two alternative (specifically to google)
search engines which promise not to record your IP address :

@_subject: Debian/Ubuntu tor users, please check for core files 
I have a tor server on my laptop and a public relay on a linode
box. Neither have any core files. Both machines running Debian
with the tor package from the testing repo.

I really like the idea of "tor+http" or "tor+https" over tor/tors
just like the way I hate the way Google Chrome has dropped "
from their URL bar.

Did you have called GPS (Global Positioning System) enabled? I'm pretty
sure "Share Location" turns on GPS.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Improving SSL settings in TBB 
Hi all,
I just came across this blog post:
    about how to improve the security settings of Firefox base browsers.
The suggested config settings work correctly with the current TBB even
with these config settings there is still an issue with Session Ticket
It would be nice to see these improved settings as the default in the
next release of TBB.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is Thunderbird safe to use with Tor now? 
I don't know specifically about Thunderbird, but I would not trust
any generic desktop appication to do the right thing without firewall
rules to enforce the correct behaviour, eg something like Tails [0] or
a dedicated Tor router [1].

Indeed, detected as malware and *is* malware are two very different
In addition any malware that is coming from the regular internet into
the Tor network should not be blamed ont Tor.

And yet you engage in behaviour that many people who have been using
mailing lists for over a decade do consider rude. For instance, replying
to a email with a Subject line of 'howsmyemail' with something not
even tangentially related to that original Subject line.
My suggestion is that you refrain from posting here for a while and
just watch and learn.

Could this situation be improved if people ran limited exit nodes that only
alloed the bitcoin p2p protocol to exit? I for one don't have enough
fireproof underwear to run a full exit node, but my node does allow
bitcoin/litecoin/darkcoin/anoncoin to exit.

Very much agree with this. I like browsing over Tor and find it annoying
when web sites just block it completely.
Yep, also requiring the user to register (with a working email address)
before being able to comment, and then manually moderating the first few comments by any newly registers user.
This does sound like a lot of work, but can easily be farmed out to trusted
users of your site who already value the site and would be more to help
maintain the quality of the site.

I thought people might be interested in this:
