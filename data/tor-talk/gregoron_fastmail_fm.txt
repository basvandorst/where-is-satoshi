@_subject: System Proxyfier for Windows:  WideCap 
I found this when looking at FreeCap.  WideCap is supposed to proxify
the whole OS I think and it handles DNS too.  I havn't tried it as I
wanted opinions first.  It is free trial for 30 days and then $20 Egold
after that (too bad it's not freeware/opensource).

@_subject: Windows: Event ID 4226 Patcher (4226 fix):  Increase max TCP 
I think I remember reading about some issue with the TCP connection
limits placed upon non-server editions of Windows OS in TCPIP.SYS.  Is
there still an issue with running a Tor node on a non-server Windows due
in part to the TCP connect limit?
Here is a great little TCPIP.SYS patcher which allows you to change the
connect limit to whatever you want.  By default Windows TCP connection
limit is set to 10.  I set mine to 100, is that a good number?
Here is the patcher and info, VERY easy to use:
And here is a good thread (from forum.my-proxy.com ) about using the
TCPIP.SYS patcher and some issue with using it on Vista to be aware of:
I really noticed a speed increase with fewer timed out proxies when
using a proxy leecher.  I use FPL (Forum Proxy Leecher) when I want to
leech open proxies.
