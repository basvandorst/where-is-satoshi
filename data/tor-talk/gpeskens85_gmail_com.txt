I'm thinking of setting up a webbased os within an hidden service. What I'm
thinking of is having 10 accounts (or more/less depending on server load)
which are publicly accesable and have a shared storage (i.e. people can save
documents/files but they are visible to others), and an option to use
bitcoins to have a private (encrypted) storage space as well.
People should be able to create encrypted containers (both within shared as
in private storage), files in private storage would be deleted on a fifo (or
last accesed) basis when space is running out. What the server should
provide is at least: office (documents, spreadsheats etc.) mail (maybe make
accounts on server? ) chat (irc and other common protocols). And maybe the
ability to set up and use one time bitcoin accounts or stuff like that. It's
of course of major importance that users should not be able to see activity
of others, nor that I as administrator could see that (except excessive
server/bandwidth load)
The most important considerations are: server load and bandwidth load, my
server is not unlimited in it's cpu and memory (hdd usage is less of a
problem) and the bandwidth available on the tor network (mine is not a
problem) might prohibit a system that is responsive enough.
Why do I want to do this ? I believe that everybody, especially political
dissidents, should have the ability of working in a clean, non monitored,
non traceable and beyond plausible deniability space.
I would however add a disclaimer that I don't want it to be used for
childporn/snuff-stuff (or other things of extreme questionable morals) and
that I count on the honesty of the users to stay within these bounds.
People think this is a good idea ? And maybe have tips to wich webbased os
distros are suitable (I prefer things that run with the least required
components within an encrypted jail) and how to set it up ?

Well it might not stop them, but I do hope that they at least think about it
and not ruin it for other users. I don't see any other way anyhow, without
checking on what users are doing on the machine which is just what I don't
want to do (in order to protect their privacy and my non-involvement in
The only other option would be to limit functionality of the box, which I
don't want to do except for load reasons (i.e. no flash/videos/etc.)

Nice :) after getting it working, I could upload an (semi functional) image
of the jail and some configuration directives so others can copy :)

received the same letter, I guess the reason for not contacting this list
is that the reach is bigger if directly contacting tor relay operators.
Anybody know what new attack he is speaking of ? I'm a bit doubtfull of
giving sys info, even though the info seems harmless with the recently new
developed DoS attack (TCP-slow  attack) I'm a bit hesitant to give
interesting sys info.
Though the information requested seems harmless I have some doubts about

Why not run something like "redsocks" (first hit on transparent socks)
 on VM1 ? It is a program that sits in between
the proxy and client. You then configure the firewall running on VM1 to
redirect traffic only through redsocks and allow no other connections.
I'd use FreeBSD/OpenBSD for this as my OS of choice as PF is very simple
and very powerfull, plus they are (imho) the most secure OS's.
