Sorry, giving out lists of keyservers is usually just bad advice.
Better tell people to use subkeys.pgp.net, or

subkeys and attribute UIDs.
All the keyserver marked as broken are known to either ignore keyupdates

@_subject: end-to-end encryption question 
Not quite.
Assume my external interface - eth0 - is configured to have the IP
address 192.0.2.10.
If I connect to that address from my own computer the destination
address will always stay 192.0.2.10 - there's no magic switching behind
the scenes.  That request is routed - on linux at least - through the lo
interface however.
As for source address, that depends on a few factors again.  If you bind
to 192.0.2.10 using OutboundBindAddress then that's the source address
that will be used.  If you don't specify one then the kernel will pick
one for you.  That's probably going to be 192.0.2.10 again but there's
no reason why it couldn't be 127.0.0.1.  Especially IPv6 likes to use
::1 (IPv6's version of 127.0.0.1) in such instances.

@_subject: What to do at IP number change? 
Don't do that.  It takes several hours before all the clients have your
current descriptor, if you keep changing it every two or so hours you
are only placing a burden on the directory infrastructure and nobody
will use you anyway.
Changing it every now and then, say daily because your ISP disconnects
you and gives you a new IP address, is ok, but the longer you run at the
same address the more useful you are.

You are right, currently Tor requires each node be able to talk to every
other node.  For servers there is no way to say they only want to talk
to some other servers.
Also, you can't configure different bandwidth limits based on
destination or source IP address, AS, or AS path, and I doubt that will
be added any time soon.

There is no such thing as I1.
And Internet2 is just another network making up the Internet*, just like
G?ANT, DFN, ACOnet or many others.  It's not even particularly special
or anything.
And no, it's probably not feasible and it's very like good idea to run
extra Tor networks on all of them.
* well, Internet2 is not even that, it's just the consortium that runs it

You are running into Are you trying to build the debian package or upstream's Tor?
If the debian package try building 0.2.0.22-rc-1 from experimental, or
fix debian/rules to do the same hack on your arch as we do on mipsel and

I have explained it more than once.  I think the proper way is to teach
vidalia to use a control unix domain socket and have it use the Tor that
is installed and running on the system.
Once vidalia knows how to do that I can enable the control socket in the
package by default.
