Yes, you are missing something...and that is header
munging.  If you use compression then the headers
can/may not be munged (spoofed and modified) as far as
I understand.  I do all my header munging (Firefox browser) via.
about:config and extensions, some people use Privoxy,
etc.  This is my compression setting in about:config, it
disables all compression:

Hi Juliusz,
--- Juliusz Chroboczek
Has there been any further off-list discussion on this
I for one would like to see (1) and (3) implemented as
I tend to agree with Roger.  While the threat may or
may not be serious, it does at least add extra data
which may be used in nefarious ways (like cookies,
etc, you mentioned). Another possible anonymity threat is when a Tor user
routing through Polipo passes the NEWNYM signal to
Tor.  This signal makes Tor use a new (clean) circut
for new connections.  For example: a Tor user routing through Polipo passes
the NEWNYM command to Tor while staying on the same
website.  The users IP is now different for new
connections to the website, but the new IP is still
using the Polipo connection created/used by the
previous IP (circut).  This seems like a possible
anonymity threat in regards to an adversary
correlating pseudonym's and there activity.   Could Polipo be made to listen for the NEWNYM signal
passed to Tor? It seems to me good option/solution
would be to have Polipo shutdown a connection/s when a
NEWNYM signal is passed to Tor.  This way Tor and
Polipo will be acting in unison.  They won't
contradict each other in terms of Tor changing circuts
(IP's) to the host but Polipo keeping the same
connections to the host.  Maybe offer this in the
Polipo config file, Tor users can turn it on, other
users can keep it off?
Best regards,
Do You Yahoo!?

wow.  You must have a big head! (in more ways than

Great, thanks
Well, we are talking about Tor...
You may be correct, I see both points of view.  But,
may I say that it shows character for you to do this
even though you think it's a waste.
No, I didn't say that.  But IMHO having Polipo
shutdown connections when a NEWNYM signal is sent may
be one part of the puzzle.
Well, that would not be very efficient as I have been
known to use NEWNYM many times in a single on-line
session.  I agree however that the browser should be
purged of session data like cookies, cache, etc as
should Polipo's cache be cleared when sending the
NEWNYM signal...especially if staying on the same

Privoxy a non-starter in regards to filtering.  IMO all filtering, User-Agent spoofing, etc should be
handled by the browser (about:config is your friend)
because the HTTP/S protocol is filtered.

Forgive the naive nature of this question...
I have compiled Tor and I want to run it off my USB
HDD but I'm not sure how.  Should I just copy over the
build directory ~/tor-0.1.2.10-rc/? If so what are
essential files? What should the "DataDirectory" option be set to?

I am planing on running the USB from my Kubuntu OS.  I
assume that I could install the Tor dependencies on
the HDD...if there are any to install which are not
present by default in Kubuntu-desktop 6.10 that is. I was under the impression that Tor dependencies
(OpenSSL?, etc) are installed on the HDD and Tor stuff
(Tor, torrc, tor-resolve, source, etc) could be placed
onto the USB.    I intend to install Tor, Vidalia and Polipo onto my

used before building a .deb package but could be

If I have time today, yes. There is a wiki entry
stating those need to be set to break. I was referring to the fact it is suggested is set
those so they'll break, I wasn't specifically
referring to TorButton.  Maybe I was overly harsh then, I can see where the
confusion may came from if someone read these
sections.  If one thought you _had_ to follow the old
directions above then yes, it would seem like
TorButton is mis-configured.
TorButton handles these correctly and does not route
them into Privoxy, it just breaks them with a zero
port...which is what was recommended by the Tor devs.
when Scott Squires when building TorButton (as far I
as remember).  There is no need set those up to go into Privoxy if
the port is zero.

It looks like you are correct, port zero means no
proxy is used
I appologize for dismissing this issue without first
verifying it myself.  So TorButton needs an update it seems after all. I
think Mike Perry is working on some other stuff with
TorButton so maybe he can correct this while he's at

@_subject: Please don't recommend Tor Button! 
Yes, TorButton's configuration is ok...and a little
more background info for those who are interested:
FF conciders a port set to zero to be an un-proxies
protocol and direct connects to the Internet.
When the Socks address:proxy is set it routes other
non-proxied protocols into Socks settings.
So because TorButton sets FF ftp and gopher to port
zero it allows the Socks proxy to route and break
ftp/gopher against Tor.
