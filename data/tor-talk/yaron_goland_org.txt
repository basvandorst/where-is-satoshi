@_subject: Vidalia on OS X 
When the new Tor package was released I saw that it said there were  problems with Vidalia on OS X so I waited until the dot release went  out that removed that warning and installed. Tor is running just fine  on my OS X box but whenever I open Vidalia it can't seem to figure  out that Tor is already running and instead tries to start it which  of course fails because it's already running and thus the localhost  Tor port isn't available. If I want to use Vidalia on OS X do I have  to figure out how to disable Tor's auto-start?
