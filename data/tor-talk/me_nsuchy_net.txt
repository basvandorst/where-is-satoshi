I just had the greatest idea that came into my head. There is a Tor
implentation of Tor called JTor written in Java, and Google App Engine
offers Free to Low Cost Application Hosting. Why not use JTor and modify it
as Java Backend to connect to Tor Hidden Services and combine it with the
Mirrorrr  (through a modified version
of Jython). It would allow people to view Tor Hidden Services from a
standard web browser with a limited amount of anonymity. What do you guys
think of this project? I'm going to learn Java and this is going to be my
project. "JTHSV" (Java Tor Hidden Service Viewer). I'm not a programmer yet
but is this project do-able?

Explain what you mean by reach your mirrored and why would I get a
complaint for proxy service? I already do this and many others do too with
ease. Google protects it's members.

I'm not saying it's secure enough for illegal activity but it could
download a couple of pirated ebooks or whatever people want. Just keep a
Java Back end. Yeah there would be logs. Not anonymous or secure but eh
it's so useful.

If I got a complaint I would address it with Google.

I only use anonymity when I don't want data to be stored about me. I trust
Google and this domain is hosted with Google Apps for Business (nsuchy.net).
I use TBB as my real incognito browser.

As an alternative to unsubscribing to the Tor Mailing Lists you can do a
few things:
If you use Gmail-
Go into your settings and create a filter to move all mail from the mailing
list to go to trash and be marked as read
If you run your own mail server-
You could use iptables to firewall the emails away.

I'm unsure, The New Identity function is critical, I think Tor Button has
it, but Network might be a deprecated function...
