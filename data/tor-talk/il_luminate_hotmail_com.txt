Hello everyone,
Sorry for my previous test posts!
I'm a newbie to TOR. Just found it today acctually and I'm wondering how to set up
Apache to run as a hidden service.
I tried to find some other messages regarding this issue but couldn't find If someone knows a good guide please provide an URL.
Tried  but I can't get it to work (recieveing a Privoxy 404 cant find page)
WinXP (static IP, no firewall, no router, directly connected to the Apache (my httpd.conf settings)
Listen localhost:5222
ServerName localhost:80
So when I  type   in my browser I get "No such domain
Your request for  could not be fulfilled, because the domain name localhost could not be resolved. "
What's the problem?

Hi Patric,
Thank you very much for replying and trying to help me out here. I'm going When I type in 127.0.0.1:5222 it still doesn't work.
My guess is that I'm doing something majore wrong...just a guess :)
I edited the Torc file to this :
HiddenServiceDir d:\thor
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:5222
And then I pasted in the URL (found in the host file) in the browser and voila, recieved my local Apache welcome page (d:/program files/apache When it comes to the HOSTS file I found it here D:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc (good to know for others using XP) But what should I add in the HOSTS File??? Is sais:
127.0.0.1       localhost
Where can I find some good tutorials and HowTo's on TOR and Privoxy?
Thanks in advance and Cheers to ya all
Maybe it's not correct to ask this question here, but I'm running a small website where I have a news section and some weather forcast. This is done by a simple PHP script but the host that I acctually parse from has banned my IP.
So my question is if it's possible to still parse the pages when using TOR or not???
