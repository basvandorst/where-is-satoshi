I remember something about a major DNS server that was abusing its power
and redirecting requests for nonexistent domains to advertising pages.
Also, ISPs sometimes redirect bad requests:
..and get lots of flak for it. (Not nearly enough, I say!)
I also came across a note that ISPs may be randomly redirecting requests
for existing sites to domainsponsor.com in a bid to up their profits:

Certainly. Anything performed within a web page is going to be allowed.
 The mail sending occurs on the web server's side, which does not
(necessarily...) use Tor.

The traffic itself is usually what leaks your IP address.  Tor isn't
responsible for making sure that the data your applications send doesn't
contain identifying information.

I've written up a draft post of Firefox tweaks and best practices to

really relevant to Tor.

That's a good question -- I'm really not sure, since I've never used
Torpark. Of course, the same principles can be applied to both the
standalone Torpark and the installed Firefox + Tor.

More likely is that root certificate companies are forced to hand over
the secret keys of directory servers to the NSA. Now, that assumes that
the directory server signatures are based on SSL root certificates -- is
that true?

Alternatively, he could get a friend somewhere else in the world to run
an SSH server, and then tunnel everything through that. Wouldn't that be
a better solution? I mean, he's not going for anonymity, just data and
destination privacy, right?  Plus, then he wouldn't have to worry about
malicious exit nodes.
I'd offer my own computer, but I'm behind a college campus firewall

This is true, but I tend to regard closed-source software as riskier,
simply because the bugs are less well documented. :-)
I agree about the text browser -- I should really familiarize myself
with Lynx.

I love how they describe VoIP traffic as "revenue leakage",
characterizing it as "unauthorized" or "illegal":
As if somehow ISPs have to protect themselves from people *gasp* sending
_data_ over the pipes.
Now, I know that Tor is not intended for high-bandwidth usage -- what
is? IIP, maybe? I don't know about the various alternatives.

I'm new to the community, so I'm not very familiar with the history of
gov't-Tor interactions (though I can take a guess at the general
attitudes.)  However, I recall reading that some gov't organizations use
Tor for their own protection.  Don't they have a vested interest in
keeping it alive?
I'm just trying to determine if we can use the gov't against itself
somehow.  You know, take some of the burden of ourselves.

I'm not so sure that a dedicated appliance or Torpark-on-USB is going to
help with the confiscation issue.  When the police come in, they take
*everything*.  They're not going to say "Oh look, it's Torpark on USB,
let's just take the USB drive."  They'll take the whole system.
However, a dedicated Tor appliance that is not in proximity to other
machines might work well.

Hash: SHA1
I have installed the Tor client on the computers of a number of fellow
students.  We are currently behind a college firewall, so running Tor in
server mode wouldn't help, but a lot of these folks go home during the
summer and have nice, fat DSL or cable connections.
The problem is that they would be running unreachable Tor servers.  Is
that harmful or useless to the network, or would the extra
bandwidth/nodes during the summer help overall?
