@_subject: A warning to proxy writers 
Get the firefox guys to start adding integration features.
Justification:  Browsers are big, complex bits of software, which will
do surprising things.  Some of those things, like "load an image via
ftp," are configurable, or handle-able by a proxy.  In other cases,
(flash, or javascript, which is now part of PDF) the proxy potentially
has to deal with the covert channel problem.  Things get easier if the
browser participates in protecting people's privacy.

Exiting 0 has often meant "normal."  So I could see a change to exit
status to a different value, which would make a sleep 900 a fine plan.

Anonymity loves company.  So ignoring speed and usability doesn't
work.  (I'm not saying company provides security, but an absence of
company certainly detracts from it.)

Tor ...96 works for me on 10.3.8
But I do notice that the default install on a mac does not filter
user-agent.  This is probably a good thing; it helps bad web sites
work, but maybe document it?

Do you know how flexible their firewall is?  Could they block access
to their posting CGIs?  Anonymous access to medical information is
personally and socially valuable, and read-only access seems like a
decent comprimise, once they calm down.

Ironicly, I'm working on a blog post right now about the positive uses
of anonymity, and have 4 of my 7 examples from Wikipedia.

My apologies if the sarcastic comparison doesn't work for you.  Banksy
has done thing like hanging his art in the british museum.  Some
people see that as entirely wrong.  I think there's a long continuum,
and that's what I was trying to make clear.  Unsuccessfully, as it
turns out, I didn't make it at all clear.

I'm sorry, but I don't follow your failure to follow.
You write:
"If folks knew who he was, they could stop  him from doing more; ie he
would be spotted walking into the museum" and "But I can't think of
something like tor making what he does possible."
Tor provides the internet equivallent of the real world anonymity
which he enjoys.  Banksy can't do what he does in the real world
because bits of internet architecture accidentally track him.  Tor
changes that balance.
That changed balance doesn't come with a morality bit:  If we let
people be anonymous, some of them will do bad things, others will do
great things.

that help people see what we're doing and why.  If you put Wikipedia
in the same set as China, then pretty soon you'll have no allies.
        There are folks who will never see what we want to accomplish
or why.  There are others who might, and starting out with "Wikipedia
is asking for it," while possibly correct, will not help us win any
popularity contests.

Hi Jim,
Thanks for joining in.  I'm glad to hear that we're on the same side.
I know that I don't have a good understanding of the type of vandalism
you're mentioning, or how often you saw it.  Do you have some samples
you could point me to?  Do you have any numbers (or even feel) for
what fraction of your total vandalism came in via Tor?  Via other open
proxies?  Via hotspots or zombies/RBL'd hosts?  Any numbers on
what proportion of tor users were being vandals?

Popups are smaller than bars, and the proper dialog here (I think)
should include a reminder of what Tor is and why you're seeing the
alert.  The buttons should be labeled "Visit without privacy
protections/Cancel Visit" Or otherwise something in line with the idea
that buttons should be verbs.

Nope.  I think they'd be making different statements than they're
making, and I think that they'd have avoided the subject in private.
