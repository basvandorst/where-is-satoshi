@_subject: [tor-talk] Time synchronisation 
Hi all
Does tor do any form of time synchronisation?  I've noticed that I've been
getting requests for HS descriptors often days after I am the right node in
the DHT and for several days afterward.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Research Framework update 
Hi all
I thought I'd give you an update on where the Tor Research Framework is now
at as there's been lots of development over the last few weeks. At present,
the framework is a largely fully functional tor client with code that is
easy to read, follow and crucially change for custom functionality.
URL: The examples exercise a big chunk of the functionality so in the examples
directory, we now have examples on how to do:
- Circuit building, Random circuits based on flags, etc
- Building HS circuits and establishing streams to their service
- Consensus parsing examples
- RELAY_EARLY scanner - scans HSDirs looking for RELAY_EARLYs coming the
wrong way (aka the recent Blackhat deanon attack)
- Tor SOCKS Proxy and PortForwarder
The examples are here:
The RELAY_EARLY scanner took around five minutes to write for example and
didn't require modifying core library code.
Work in progress
Fuzzer: We also have another chap (twilsonb) working on a fuzzing framework
for Tor that is capable of fuzzing the protocol and directory services -
although this is at early stage I'm sure he'd welcome help from anyone
Relay: We're working on building the capability to act as a Tor relay with
examples for building malicious guard nodes that deny circuits or do
correlation attacks.
Naturally, we'll also look later down the line at optionally integrating
with the shadow simulator for research which shouldn't be done on the live
If anyone is interested in helping out then please dont hesitate to get in

@_subject: [tor-talk] HS again: Portscan? 
Hi Thomas
The hidden services publish a descriptor with a subset of tor nodes (6
total).  You can run a tor node and log these descriptors (by modifying the
tor source) to learn all the hidden service addresses.
You can confirm whether a Tor HS exists simply by trying to fetch it's
descriptor (which doesn't require knowledge of the open port) and trying to
build a circuit to it (see the tor research framework for some examples: (
  Of course, there's no
way to find out which ports are open other than by scanning.

There's also the tor-research-framework
there's an example of using the consensus here:
It maintains a parsed copy of the consensus in the HashMap
Consensus.routers - it should be fairly in Java to copy this, and then diff
it at a later time with a new copy by using set difference/intersection.

@_subject: [tor-talk] T-shirt criteria 
Hi all
I've been running a relay now for almost three months with an average
bandwidth well above 500kb/sec.  This is plain to see on the link below,
but thus far I haven't received a Tor t-shirt e-mail, and my queries to
donations at torproject.org has thus far been unanswered.
What is the criteria for a t-shirt? That specified on the web site doesn't
seem to be correct as I clearly meet it but can't seem to get one.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Idea: Public verification of exit nodes and their 
I'm not sure the "web of trust" idea is reliable -  It doesn't seem to work
very well for PGP to be honest.
The second point is that identifiable exit node owners doesn't necessarily
add any security - identities are easily faked including building up
relationships as that identitiy over time.
Limiting the number of nodes you exit through is probably a bad idea too
particularly if an attacker can identify the set.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What should our 31c3 talk be? 
Hello Jacob
Just to let you know, I am also giving a talk at 31c3 on Tor, but my talk
is focussing on a research project we did on the Tor HS DHT. I was also
planning to talk a little about the Tor Research Framework and an
accessible overview of correlation attacks - if time permits.  Hope that
doesn't overlap at all with you.
Any tips very much welcome - I've never even been to 31c3 before!
We now have a talk slot at 31c3. We should plan this talk well in

@_subject: [tor-talk] Shaping Tor's traffic 
I know you weren't looking for me to reply necessarily but let me clarify.
In those slides I was principally talking about non-global adversaries -
e.g. you or me deploying an attack.  With global adversaries they have a
handful more options - namely you don't need to own the guard node if you
can monitor/delay traffic to and from it.
Sorry if it wasn't clear.
