The fantastic adventures of Jake "it's not rape if they're not awake"
Appelbaum. Installment 1.
"Welcome to today's workshop where you will learn how to setup a Tor
relay. Is anyone up for a hardcore S&M session after lunch?"
"My dick is the biggest talent attractor for Tor hands down."
"Mmm the steak here is quite delicious."
"Have you tried nipple torture before? How many needles can you take?"
"Pass the ketchup please!"
"The Pinot is exquisite. I hear that roofies really enhance the peachy
notes. I thought you'd like to try it."
No it can't be. I refuse to believe it. My hero is not a rapist. The NSA
must have planted a microchip in his brain that turns him into an
insufferable cunt every time they beam waves from their psy-ops
satellites. That or the entire Tor community are agents of disinformation
conspiring against the one and only champion of truth who will save us
