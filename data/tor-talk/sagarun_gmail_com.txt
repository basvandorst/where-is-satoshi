@_subject: Does this squid ACL really blocks tor 
I have found my network admin has added a squid ACL something like
acl numeric_IPs url_regex ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
http_access deny CONNECT numeric_IPs all
And now vidalia is not able connect to tor network (cant create circuits),
does this really blocks tor?
