Hash: RIPEMD160
Hello, first post on here.
I'm currently using tor-0.1.1.22 on Vector Linux SOHO 5.1.1, which I
compiled myself, as I did the previous versions I've used.  I
recently  tried to compile tor-0.1.1.24 (now at least 4 times), and
each time I've compiled and installed (package created using
checkinstall, and installed via installpkg and uninstalled via
Gslapt). I get the following when I start it  I'll start it in a
terminal, and everything looks normal, states it's opening Socks
listener on 127.0.0.1:9050, however it crashes at this point every
time. I'm using gcc 3.4.6 to compile it, and up to date librarys.
I've been doing a straight forward ./configure make | checkinstall |
installpkg tor-0.1.1.24-i686-1.tgz, and am up a stump as to what the
problem could be. Any suggestions as to how to get past this will be
very much appreciated.

Quick question then, *how* much bandwidth is required to run Tor as a
server, or router?  I've only recently upgraded to DSL light (can't
afford full DSL, and I don't remember the advertised bandwidth, but
using my ISP's bandwidth test it shows 118.6 kbps with a maximum
download speed of 14.83 kbps).  Now I'm sure full DSL has more than
enough bandwidth, but as far as DSL light goes, I'm not sure.
Wouldn't be that much of a concern except for the fact that I do quiet
a bit of downloading and I don't know how much of an effect that will
have on performance.  I know you can limit the bandwidth in the torrc
file, but if it's going to be cutting it very close it may not be that
much of a help.

In regards to the technical aspect of Tor, yes it is off topic, but in
regards to Tor's actual purpose, it is very much on topic.  While this
lists purpose it primarily technical, the political, social, moral
issues regarding Tor also need to be addressed. Perhaps, another list
is in order?

I'm taking a second look at it, and a third and forth ect... etc...
despite the fact that I've been up far too long.
Yes, that is correct.
Quiet correct, except that  you do not take into consideration that
since the birth of Christ the world is under a new covenant, and the
old covenant ( the one in effect B.C. while still a good general
guideline is not literally God's Law.
While I recognize that these philosophies may have something to
contribute to understanding human morality and nature, and did the
pagan Greek's, I do not recognize them as religions.  The only
authority a Christian can recognize is the authority of God.  If that
offends the current *multiculturist* (sp?) sensibilities of the
majority of people today, so be it.
Nay, I would say!  I am a Jeffersonian to the core (sorry if you're
not familiar with the Jeffersonian philosophy, but a quick study on
Jefferson would do everybody a lot of good).  While I recognize that
there are moral absolutes, something the moral subjectivests, and
moral relitivists today reject (which is why we have such high rates
of all kinds of crime and immorality), I also recognize the fact that
*is* their choice.  I also recognize that there has to be some kind of
basic  fundamental foundation for law (The Ten Commandments are the
foundation for most western law, especially English Common Law), for
any civilization to exist.  Again, though, I am a hard core
Jeffersonian, and the core of Jeffersonian thought was what he called
a patchwork of cultures.  A confederation of states, each with it's
own individual culture, and free to be as it thought proper.  I
currently reside in Mississippi, and say the laws in one of the
surrounding states (Tenn., Ala., Ark., or La.) were based upon pagan
or even satanic beliefs.  Despite the fact that I believe their
culture, their law  to be sinful, and wrong, I would in no way attempt
to force them to conform to the laws of my State (that is of course
unless they attempted to force me to comply with their culture/law.).
So, perhaps you now have a better understanding of my position.
Regardless, it's way past time for me to hit the hay.  So perhaps if
you're interested we can continue the conversation at a later date.
You're Obd't Servant,
Thomas M. Jett
No one is  forcing..........those who are forced to God have no Belief
in God, they just comply to avoid oppression.

There is, it's old but it's something that could be built upon, an old
variant of Damn Small Linux called ELE (everything leaves encrypted)
that could be used as a base for something like this.  It could be
updated, complete with webserver & whatever else, and set up to
install on a hdd with out a lot of trouble.  Just a thought, but I do
believe it would work.

I just opened Tork and there in the server list was a server named
NSAFortMeade.  Is this for real, or is the NSA running a Tor Server?
If it's for real, it's going to spook a lot of people away from Tor,
at least those who are inclined to use Tor for political reasons.

PS: let me ad an addendum, the server in question is in the
Routers/Entry Guards list.

Yeah, that's the problem, given it says NSA, who knows for sure.  As
arrogant as govt. has gotten in the last few years it would not
surprise me one bit to see them run a server under that name.

Well, that's the problem with power, those in power enjoy rubbing it
in the face of those they have power over.  Remember, I believe it was
Lord Acton who said "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely".  While I doubt it's a serious threat, still the potential
exists, and given the current political climate it would not surprise
me if they ran a server under a name like that just to scare people
into not using Tor.

The most likely person to be scared, and the one that the NSA would
want to scare, would be a political activist.  Most, but not all of
them (I fall into the category of not all of them ;-) ) are not all
that technically inclined, and use Tor based upon faith that it will
give them an anonymous means to research, and in some cases
communicate over a highly monitored  internet.
In other words, the intent would be to create a "chilling effect".
Not all would fall for it, but perhaps enough to diminish the positive
effects (upon freedom of speech & expression, especially political
speech) of Tor.
Perhaps, because of the intimidating strategy used by the present
occupants of 1600 Penn. Ave. I'm expecting this type of thing, but
history tends to prove my concerns in this regard.  Just look at the
actions of governments in the past, all have used intimidation as a
means of quelling dissent.
