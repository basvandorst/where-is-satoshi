Hello people,
I'm contacting you on behalf of Manchester Free Software[1], a group
set up in 2007 to promote and raise awareness of free software[2] in
Manchester. As well as the free software angle, our group also covers
topics which impact on the freedoms of computer users.
Therefore, we are hoping that someone from the Tor community would be
willing to give a talk on the project and/or conduct a workshop in
partnership with MFS and the MDDA[3].
The schedule for talks is relatively busy at the moment with speakers
booked up until Christmas. Although, we can be more flexible with the
If anyone is interested then please do not hesitate to contact me for
further information.
Thank you all for your time.
Best wishes,
