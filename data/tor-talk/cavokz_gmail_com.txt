Here I am. Box has been rebooted with an updated tor debian package
0.2.0.31-1, old one was 0.2.0.30-2.
Due to other reasons this morning it was offline and I've been unable
to mail too. I am recovering a couple of messages I sent yesterday on
this ml which have been dropped becaouse (I guess) wrote them with the
wrong From email address.
I put online the logs of the last few days:

Hi all, I am the mnl's operator, Yes, it is a P4 step C, Northwood.
The fact of not being an exit node would make it a better corruped
relay? I mean, if I would like to DOS the Tor network I would be better
to set the trojan node as internal?
What happened this weekend is that I have not been able to reach that
box. Anyway now I recall clearly why I had the impression that it was
alive. Indeed ssh did received something from it, it could not complete
the login in for other reasons. Being the box hosed by Tor, I can now
guess the sshd daemon was only very slow.
