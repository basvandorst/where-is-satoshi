@_subject: [tor-talk] Need Tor service to use tor browser? 
before anything, excuseme for ask such a beginners question.
But I realized that I a confused about something, and sice I recently trying to stay more anonymous online, it happens to directly concern this.
So, I download tor browser, and I'm running arch linux, do I need to install tor to use tor browser in order to do things right?
That's confusing me a lot. Moreover when I switch to my phone and find out that in order to use orfox you need to install orbot.
I know is a silly question, but if someone could brigme some light and put things togheter in the right order, I'll really appreciatte.

Thanks for the reply. And sorry, I by pass something in the download page wich is quiete clear:
"Tor Browser lets you use Tor on Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS, or GNU/Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable)."
