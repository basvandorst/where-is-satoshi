That is the very minimum bandwidth rate. Circuits are picked
heuristically based on the available bandwidth so by setting it to
such a tiny value you'll be largely unused.

Yup. It only shows up if you're either a bridge or guard since those
are generally the only positions where you'll see client traffic.
Could be. Or could be that connection resolution is broken (tor made a
change that broke quite a few things including the proc contents I
use). Does the connection panel give you any information besides the
circuits? If not, or you have a log message informing you that
connection resolution is broken then that could be the issue.
Glad you like it!

Tor changes the circuits that you're using every ten minutes, which
usually changes the exit node that you're using (and hence the ip that
you're coming from). The Outlook app probably logs you out when that
happens. You can change the circuit duration via the
'MaxCircuitDirtiness' option in your torrc.

Hi Lunar. Glad that you're finding stem to be useful!
Sathyanarayanan suggested putting together a page with stem examples
( If you wouldn't mind check_tor
would be perfect for that. Some more inline comments would be nice,
but otherwise it's a fine script. :)
As mentioned on irc this moved a long while back to...
It looks like tempdir is solely used to determine if self.datadir was
created via mkdtemp(), and hence if it should be cleaned up afterward.
Maybe it would make sense for this to be a 'self.datadir_is_temp'
If you're using a control socket then there's little point in also
setting CookieAuthentication. Control sockets are based on filesystem
permissions, like an auth cookie, so it doesn't provide any added
Why do you set this explicitely? The cookie path is part of the
PROTOCOLINFO response so it isn't needed to authenticate.
You might want to either wrap get_info() calls in try/catch blocks or
provide a default argument (ie, something like
"get_info('net/listeners/socks', '"0"')").
Nice, I didn't think of checking the errno. The above will only work
on python 2.6 and above. If you want 2.5 compatability for non-windows
then you can fall back on os.kill(). Here's what I do in stem's
if self._tor_process:
  # if the tor process has stopped on its own then the following raises
  # an OSError ([Errno 3] No such process)
  try:
    if stem.prereq.is_python_26():
      self._tor_process.kill()
    elif not stem.util.system.is_windows():
      os.kill(self._tor_process.pid, signal.SIGTERM)
    else:
      test.output.print_line("failed (unable to call kill() in python
2.5)", *ERROR_ATTR)
  except OSError:
    pass
  self._tor_process.communicate()  # blocks until the process is done
There's quite a few spots in this script that could benefit from
comments. This line especially I'm not sure why a thirty second sleep
is necessary.
You might want to call
'self.controller.enable_feature("VERBOSE_NAMES")' during setup,
otherwise the nickname may be None prior to tor 0.2.2.1.
When you call self.controller.new_circuit() would the await_build
argument help? You're presently listening for CIRC events to call
attach_stream() when the circuit is done being built, and that's
exactly what await_build is intended to help with.
Btw, if circuits always fail to be created then the retry in
handle_circ() will produce an infinite loop. Also, new_circuit() can
potentially raise a ControllerError.
I was about to warn that this would break for new tor versions due to
the switch to microdescriptors, but I suppose that's what
FetchUselessDescriptors is for. 'UseMicrodescriptors 0' might be a
little clearer, or falling back on  microdescriptors. Stem presently
does not have microdescriptor support, but that's what I'm currently
working on (it should be done sometime this week)...
If you do fall back on microdescriptors then be aware that they're a
bit more painful to work with than server descriptors for this sort of
task. For more on that see...

Hi Roc. In theory there are SoaT scanners running and sending their

report to tor-exitscanner@ was on 6/9/12 and as I understand it SoaT
needs a lot of love. In addition to that our process for giving relays

manual intervention by three extremely busy people.
Like many of our spaces the trouble is that there's no one presently
dedicated to making it better. It looks like a fun area (I've been
tempted to write a SoaT counterpart for years) but lack the bandwidth.

Roc Admin, glad you're interested in bad relay detection!
Does this mean that you're planning to expand the SoaT codebase? Write
a revised version? If the project is going to be revived then it would
make sense for it to take advantage of one of our newer controller
stem (threaded, similar to TorCtl) - txtorcon (twisted) - Correct. Three of the directory authorities vote on the BadExit flag
which, when set, causes Tor clients to avoid using that relay as an
exit. There are also a couple other methods (invalid and reject) for
removing a relay, for a little more on this see...
There are a couple troubles though with the present relay flagging strategy...
1. We don't have anyone actively monitoring for bad relays or
maintaining SoaT (or projects like it).
2. Even when a bad exit *is* reported our process for flagging it is
pretty well broken. To be flagged at least two of the three authority
operators that vote on the BadExit flag need to take manual action.
All three operators are highly busy people so in practice relays don't
get flagged without considerable nagging.
We are certainly interested in improvements on both counts, it just
takes someone wanting to lead the space.
Cheers! -Damian

Stem is compatible with python 2.6 and higher (including the 3.x

interoperability with new releases of tor.

* How we find bad relays.
Philipp and my interest I think is in making the former public (as

to do), but leave the later to the discretion of the scanner's writer
(Philipp in the case of ExitMap). I'd like for us to be transparent
about bad relay flagging, but I can certainly understand if our

This is the last major feature going into Stem's 1.2.0 release, which
is coming out later this month. Until then you can easily give it a
whirl with...
% git clone % cd stem
% ./tor-prompt
Running into an issue? Got a feature request? As always feedback
appreciated! -Damian

@_subject: [tor-talk] What should our 31c3 talk be? 
I suppose another updated 'tor ecosystem' presentation could be an
option (*). Question I've learned to ask for presentations is: what is
your goal? What are you hoping to get out of this? Recruit volunteers?
Dispel some myth? Entertain?
Cheers! -Damian
* For those who aren't familiar with it, this is a topic we did a
couple years back...
... which I gave an updated version of more recently, but to a smaller
audience and with a tighter focus on the projects...

contacting customers to threaten termination of service.)
Andrew, Tor's executive director, works directly with domestic abuse
victim organizations quite a bit so he could likely talk to this. As
for stats, I'm not sure what kind of numbers you mean but obviously
with a decentralized anonymity network we don't have figures for how
it's used. :)
As to Ted's point about list moderation, Karsten and I have been
managing the lists from a Mailman perspective but neither of us are
interested in policing threads. I hope tor-talk@ stays civil enough
that it doesn't require moderation but if it doesn't then someone else
(would need to be well known by us within the community) would need to
take that role.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Summer of Privacy 
Do you want to make Tor even better, and get paid in the process? If you are a
student, we have good news for you: the Tor Project is pleased to announce our
first Summer of Privacy!
  Thanks to Google, over the last eight years Tor has mentored 53 students over
summers. This year the program was trimmed back to make room for new
organizations. So, rather than wait another year we're starting a program
of our own!
The Tor Summer of Privacy is a pilot program for students that want to
collaborate and develop privacy tools. So why apply?
* You will work with a world-class team of anonymity experts and developers
  on an anonymity network that is already protecting millions of people daily.
* We only write free (open source) software. The tools you make won't be
  locked down or rot on a shelf.
* Your work could contribute to academic publications. Tor development
  raises many interesting research questions.
* You can work your own hours in your own locations. As long as you get
  the job done, we don't care about the process.
* ... oh, and of course there's also the $5,500 stipend for the summer. :P
We are looking for great coders who are self-motivated and able to work
independently. The deadline for applications is April 17th, 2015 which
is right around the corner, so don't be shy - apply!

Interesting. I try to keep an eye out for other controller libraries

I'll add orc to it in a bit.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why is there a huge gap between Total BW retrieved 
Hi Anonymous Kyoto. I'm having a tough time following this thread but
it's an understandable point of confusion, the bandwidth stats are
indeed odd. For Stem's part it just uses the same terminology as the
directory specification...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Announcing OnionLauncher: a Launcher for Tor 
Hi Neel, nice work! One quick note...
"TorNova has logfile and circuit viewing. OnionLauncher would require
third party programs (like arm to get this functionality)."
For what it's worth that is not true. I wrote Stem to be the new
backend of Nyx (aka arm). Just about anything arm can do Stem provides
library functions for. If you'd like help replicating any bit of
arm/nyx functionality then let me know and I'd be happy to tell you
the Stem methods to use.
Cheers! -Damian

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why does tor control port 9051 allow empty 
Hi Yuri. If you just set a ControlPort in your torrc but not password
or cookie auth then its open. Please see...
By default tor restricts access to localhost but none the less, having
authentication *or* using ControlSocket instead is advised.
Authentication in addition to a ControlSocket is ok but redundant
since filesystem permissions of a ControlSocket provide the same
safety as using an authentication cookie.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Arm 
Hi James. Most likely tor isn't using the torrrc file you think it is
or you forgot to restart the tor process after changing the torrc.
Give this a try to troubleshoot further...

That's fine. It's just an example. Try this...
% killall tor
% cat /etc/tor/torrc
% tor -f /etc/tor/torrc &
% telnet localhost AUTHENTICATE "my_password"

@_subject: [tor-talk] Arm 
Gotcha. What's probably happening here is that you're using the debian
tor instance which has its data directory owned by debian-tor. Lets
make this simple by not using /etc/tor/torrc. Make a torrc in your
home directory like the FAQ link I gave you and run 'tor -f

Nope, I was waiting for you to do the instructions I gave. Shifting my

further through this.
