@_subject: [tor-talk] Hi, does Nintendo block Tor.  I can't reach Nintendo 
I run a relay on the same computer that I use to surf the web.  I run
into websites all the time that don't work because I think they block
Tor (so I don't do business with them).  So I'm asking can anyone else
access Nintendo from Tor.  My relay is MontanaBlueSky at 184.166.103.9.
 Try accessing Nintendo through my relay.
I need to get to Nintendo because my coins are going to expire in June.
 Can I use another non Tor proxy to access Nintendo?  Any ideas.

Never mind, the Nintendo website was just offline is all.
