Dear Anonymous Person,
I have to admit, it was a very interesting read, even though I am not
too sure I agree completely. It seems as if your threat model has
encompassed every single tiny thing that could possibly (theoretically)
go wrong, without much thought given to real-world randomness and
incompetence... so I thought I'd make a few observations.
1. Your use of Tor. If you were to run, say, an instance of TAILS with
tor set up to act as a relay, that would increase your anonymity greatly
(in fact, I have yet to hear of a case where someone running a tor relay
was identified and/or arrested solely based on that fact). If you wanted
to add an additional step, you could run your whole connection through a
good VPN server that allows anon payments (with bitcoin) and doesn't
keep logs, like Mullvad.net, THEN run a tor relay... I'm not saying it'd
be the fastest option imaginable, but it would throw a lot of obstacles
in the way of anyone trying to trace your location.
2. Email. I signed up for mailoo.org through Tor, I believe. But for all
practical purposes, you could easily get a disposable e-mail address
through a Firefox plugin called Bloody Vikings. Otherwise, pretty much
any web mail will do... just war drive and sign up through the first
open wi-fi connection you find ;)
3. Bitcoins. Yes, block chains are not that anonymous, especially
considering the difficulty of buying them legitimately in the first
place. How about a coin mixing service like  Their
methodology is very interesting, and it seems like you'd be able to
'launder' ordinary coins, bought legitimately through an exchange...
There are a few other sites like this one: 4. Do you really need your own dedicated VPS?! And only in developed
Western countries? Have you checked out this list of BTC-friendly
 ?
This guy, for example, will register a wide range of domains, with fees
starting from 1 BTC per year, and you can provide pretty much any e-mail
address you want:  In other words,
it's never in your name... His hosting costs 0.5 BTC/month, though he is
dependant on his provider's T&C...
Anyway, my point is that there are ways to acquire BTC, randomised
enough not to be a concern, after which you can buy all the hosting (and
related) services your heart desires. And if your threat model
encompasses an organisation with vast resources, like the NSA for
example, consider that they haven't yet managed to track down the guys
running the Silk Road drug site ( ;)
That's my 0.001 BTC worth :)

A secure VPN (meaning no logging, and anonymous payment) with Tor, plus
HTTPS or FTPS to the server you want to upload to...

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to get browser after closing it ? 
Good question, it's been bugging me since they introduced TBB. The best
alternative I came up with it having it constantly running and just
moving the browser to a different desktop (in linux).
Hopefully they'll figure something out soon!

Hi Hugh,
No such thing as a stupid question!
Can you give us some more information about your computer, which
operating system are you using, what version of Tor Browser Bundle did
you install and how...  when you start it the way you do, do you see the
little onion icon in the system tray?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How dangerous are DNS leak? 
Hash: SHA1
I'd like to add to this question: can a DNS request be used to track
which IP addresses have visited which sites (assuming that your ISP is
not a threat)?
main problem is own ISP knowing about some access, but not any details
of the transaction?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Putin's fascist band intend to ban the Tor 
They're using the same argument as everywhere else: there are laws in
place that ban access to harmful sites, namely child porn. Child
pornographers and other "criminals" use circumventing technology such as
proxies and Tor to bypass the ban. Therefore, if you love children, ban
all proxies! And the best one of all keeps cropping up: only people who
have something to hide (criminals) use these technologies - said Sergey
Zhuk from the 'Head Hunters' anti-paedophilia association.
Deja vu. The scariest thing is that they might even pass this shit in
the world's largest country with one of the world's largest internet
