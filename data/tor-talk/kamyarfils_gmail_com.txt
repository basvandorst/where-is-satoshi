Hi,
 It seems that "Expert Bundle" is just a SocksProxy,
i did configure my browser's port as 9050 and could surf the web, but what
about "DNS leakage" issue ?
after following article /tor/wiki/doc/Preventing_Tor_DNS_Leaks
steps adding a line to about:config in FireFox, still DNSleakage exists,
I use WinXP,
any comments suggestions?

"Browser Bundle" got crashed as i mentioned in my previous post and
attached the log message,
seems that DNSLeakage issue solved after enabling FoxyProxy, i'm happy now
...enjoying ;)

Thanks for your reply ,
I use both FireFox and IE, same problem on both, and with TOR i can't surf
here's output after running Polipo:
"DNS: couldn't open /etc/resolv.conf: No such file or directory
Disabling disk cache: No such file or directory
Disabling local tree: No such file or directory
Established listening socket on port 8123."
My OS is WINXP,SP3,
should i configure anything manually in TOR "settings"?
and i'm confused, what's Polipo,TOR, Vidalia ?
