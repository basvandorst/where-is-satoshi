Hi there!On a specific game i wan't to use multiple IP's to register and play.This may not cause something as, "You are banned because of a proxy' or whatsoever Is there a possibility for me that i can use something to pretend Bans/Notifications that im using 2 accounts?Kind regards.

It is a webbrowser game.   is what i am talking about.
I need to find a way that i can play multiple accounts at the same time on different ips.
Each account needs to have his own ip.
That's the idea.
