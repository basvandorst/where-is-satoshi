Hello anyone who knows about such things;
I'm trying out the Tor Browser Bundle, and I see Javascript is enabled in the browser. Can I turn this off or is that option required left on for certain functionality in the bundle?

Maybe the developer(s) of the bundle and/or torbutton might wander along and see this thread, and confirm whether or not javascript needs to stay on in the browser.
I originally asked this because, when testing my connection, a little more personal info is revealed with the browser's javascript turned on than when off, such as the local time zone. I do appreciate however that the config of the torbutton is set to enforce privacy and kill/block most (all?) nosy javascript.
If I/we don't find the definitive answer, I suppose it is best to trust the default settings in the bundle rather than potentially break something by turning off javascript. It would however be very nice to know for sure wouldn't it, seeing as leaving javascript enabled in the browser seems to contradict one of the commonly held 'rules' of 'safe
