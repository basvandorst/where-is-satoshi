In the open source world these scripts are free for all.
Besides that, signals are working natively on Linux since 12 years
and in Unix since 30 years!
One can choose JavaScript, PERL, Python, PHP, Ruby and
many more. A visit to Sourceforge will reveal the Awful truth!
Once a Micro Softhead too.

Why don't you use a simple CD-ROM to boot your computer? Don't even try
to install anything into your new hard-drive!
If that is not secure enough, what is? One can have several diffenrent
CD-ROMs with games, OpenOffice, Only Linux OS with TOR but nothing else
Is this a secret?

Try links. You can find it at It is a better text only browser than Lynx.  I always use it when

Several things, like wrong port number for Privoxy but there was
something else that is yet to be analysed.  Tor works fine
with FireFox now.
I still have to vade through all the log files. It is an experimental
installation on Debian GNU/Linux that I use to study a combination
of Tor, Ossec and Netfilter. Tor slows down everything but that is
the price we have to pay. Ossec and Netfilter doesn't slow down
