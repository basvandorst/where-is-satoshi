@_subject: [tor-talk] To how many other relays does a relay have 
Jann Horn schreef op 27/12/14 om 16:23:
Hi Jann,
It depends on the OR. I had a quick look at some of my own ORs: a relay with ~5MB/s had an average of 40 open connections to other ORs, and a relay with ~20MB/s reported 250. These numbers seem rather stable: across all my nodes similar numbers are reported.
That said, these are both exits. The numbers may be different for relays that are mainly middle routers or guards.

Fosforo schreef op 16/07/14 14:15:
I think that, depending on the specific case (I don't know this 'pinkmeth'), there are some far better solutions for this :
* Find a better network for the servers and instead of doing 'nginx -> tor -> apache' just go 'nginx -> apache'. You can of course still use SSL to encrypt the data inbetween. This reduces a lot of latency.
* Rather than putting everything on a single domain, just put only the HTML on the primary .onion domain and put all static content, such as stylesheets, videos and images, on a different server. You could scale the static content part really well by just returning one of several .onion domains that all have your static content. Give the user a small cookie that can be used to make sure the same static server is always used for the same user.
* As far as I can tell nothing in the hidden service spec really blocks you from load balancing a single HS address across multiple nodes. If you run 3 nodes, tell 1 of them to handle the introductions, and have this node communicate with the other nodes which then handle the rendezvous part. It might need some hacking in the Tor code, but this should scale for several gigabits very nicely.
PS: These three are just some solutions I came up with just now - they might not even work.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Secure DNS Addresses 
Please clarify "secure"? Tor has its own built-in DNS resolution that will ignore client-side settings.
If you're referring to relay DNS: I strongly recommend running a DNS resolver locally, and enabling DNSSEC. That's as secure as you can get them.

If you can send me the source code and database (if any), I can continue to run it from a more favorable location (say, Amsterdam or Frankfurt). I have the resources/knowledge to do this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] IBM says Block Tor 
In some corporate environments this would be a reasonable thing to do. And the article that started this thread is about corporate networks. If you work in a call center with a company computer, you have absolutely no reason to use Tor. If you did use Tor, it would most likely be a red flag that you or the computer have been compromised and need investigation. Keep in mind that while at work, your boss decides what you are and aren't allowed to do with your time.
For the same reason, routing all employee traffic through a proxy and filtering sites that host games also seems reasonable.

Hi Paul,
Yes, my example was a simplification of the issue here. The point was that in some corporate environments (not all of them), the usage of Tor may be unwanted unless permission is explicitly given to the employee. Of course at a lot of companies this is not true and IBM's advice should be taken with a barrel of salt.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What relay does really help the TOR project? 
Hi Josef,
Exit nodes provide most value to the network, as they will also be able to handle entry and middle traffic.
As for porn: maybe the wiki page on porn legality [1] explains it. Also note that this kind of traffic helps to mask other kinds of Tor traffic, essentially helping the network (not to mention the popularity gain). Oh, and don't forget that the "normal" internet also has quite a high share of this kind of traffic.

Doing such research, where one would be snooping on Tor users' traffic and most likely without their consent, would be "amoral".

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is being detected to alert upon? 
The security added by Tor mimicking Firefox' TLS hello is questionable. It's a leftover concept from the initial versions of Tor, before pluggable transports became a thing.
Tor is pretty easy to fingerprint and as all relays are published in the consensus anyway fingerprinting isn't a big deal.
Bridges might have some very small benefit from looking like an old Firefox, but this is not proven. Also, pluggable transports completely eliminate the need for fingerprint resistance in Tor.

Hi Jeremy,
After reading your message I wonder whether a simple TCP proxy is what you want. Maybe have a look at haproxy?

Hi Jeremy,
Yup, that's what I meant. Put haproxy between the user and the socks proxy and it'll nicely pass sockets to Tor instances, transparently.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question Regarding Routing of Network-Traffic using 
Guards' network speeds are assessed based on the view of the network, not the client. What this means for your North Korea example is that the government couldn't affect path selection by slowing down the network, as Tor will still pick the same guards.

You can't fake a Tor relay, they are cryptographically protected. At best they could tell that you're connected somewhere, or stop you from doing that, but they can't see any of the contents, or MITM it.

Hi Marcos,
1. Do you run a relay yourself yet?
2. Combination of all of them
3. Current speed is good, in the future it will either get better, stay the same, or get worse, depending on how much the community contributes.

Hi Sebastian,
As far as I know there's no official Tor RPM channel anymore, and EPEL
won't ship alphas. There may be community run repos that have Tor
packages (I have one) but as a general rule you can't trust those and
they'll lag behind :-)
Maybe try compiling it from source?
