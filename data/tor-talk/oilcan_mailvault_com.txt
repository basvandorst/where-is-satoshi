@_subject: Publicizing Hidden Services 
May I propose adding the address of the Hidden Wiki (
 ) in a more visible location on
As it stands, it's almost impossible for most Tor users to even
that hidden services exist, or that they can use Tor for anonymous
publishing and internet services.
I think it could be pretty simple to do, just put a paragraph about
hidden services and the link on the Front, Download, or Docs page of
EFF site.  For instance, reporters who check out Tor on a colleague's
recommendation would be very pleased to see, with a quick glance, that
they could easily post documents or information on their own or with
community Hidden Services.  I think it could really build enthusiasm
the Tor project in general.
In my estimates (based on people that I've given a quick "check this
thing out" to), probably less than 5% of Tor users are even aware that
Hidden Services exist.
I think a vibrant community of interesting content on the Hidden
Internet would be a wonderful thing, and I think that it could get a
more exposure through a very simple addition to one or more of the
pages" that Tor users will look at.
