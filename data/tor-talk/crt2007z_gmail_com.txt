@_subject: Directory information no longer up-to-date; access blocked? 
Hello, my problem first started at about 8 PM EDT on August 1. I was
using Vidalia/Tor/Privoxy 0.1.2.14 for OS X, and I believe this is a
tor issue. The list of servers showed that almost all were offline,
except for different combinations of dizum, lefkada, moria2, and/or
tor26. For a while circuits were able to be made using just these, but
when I restarted my cable modem, I would only see one or two of these
servers online at a time. Note that at this point, the server list
still showed the names of all the 1000+ servers and that they were
offline. I tried upgrading to 0.1.2.15, then 0.2.0.3, then the next
day 0.1.2.16, then 0.2.0.4 after they were released, with no
improvement. At some point between thereafter, my server list started
only to show four names, the ones listed above, with one or two online
at a time. Even on occasions that three appear online, it seems unable
to create a circuit. My internet connection has remained working, and
I have done nothing to my knowledge to alter any settings (nor would I
know how) that would affect tor. I just tried uninstalling and
reinstalling with no effect; I still see only the four servers listed.
I have pasted below a couple excerpts from the message log. Please
pardon me if I included too much. Per one of the notices, is there a
way to make the directory information "up-to-date" again? Alternately,
does this look like a sign that my ISP has started blocking tor, and
if so, how can I test that? (Unfortunately I don't have another
computer or a way I can think of to connect using another ISP.) Let me
know if I can provide any further information.
Thank you to all who may be able to help.

This first excerpt is from when I could still see the 1000 server names.

Thank you for your help and interest in my problem. I believe I had
been using the default torrc; at least I had not edited it. Looking at
that file now, the only lines that are not commented out are:
SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
I also tried removing the torrc file from /Library/Tor/ and re-running
tor, but no luck?still the same four servers and no ciruit building.
Is there any other place that a dirserver would be specified? Let me
know if there is any further information I could provide to shed more
Thanks again!

That worked! I didn't think to read that file before deleting it, but
out of curiosity, what would have been in there that could cause this
problem, and do you know why the problem would suddenly materialize?
Regardless, thank you all so much for your quick attention and helpfulness!
