@_subject: [tor-talk] Running tor in a docker container as non root 
Hello !
I found some dockerfile example to use tor within a docker container.
But all are running tor as root user (which is bad) so I decided to
make my own Dockerfile with some improvements for example the
possibility to modify the configuration while the container is running.
check the Dockerfile at :
What do you think of the code in the Dockerfile ? any ideas for some
improvements ?
What do you think about keeping ".tor" directory in a volume ? is there
security risk ?
Thanks !
