OONI Explorer released

   [9]: Tor statement on Apple and backdoors
Tor Browser users are probably familiar with the CAPTCHAs CloudFlare
presents to users from IP addresses deemed to have a negative
reputation. There's a 58-point-long aggregation of thoughts from all
sides here [12]. Cloudflare put out a blog post [13] on March 30, and
Tor responded [14] on March 31.
  [12]:   [13]:   [14]: Miscellaneous News
There was a Tor presence at LibrePlanet 2016: David Goulet reports on
his discussion [15] with some activists in Mexico who depend on Tor to
stay safe from a surveillance-equipped triple threat of corporations,
government, and cartels. The Library Freedom Project ("a partnership
among librarians, technologists, attorneys, and privacy advocates which
aims to make real the promise of intellectual freedom in libraries") won
the FSF's Award for Projects of Social Benefit [16].
  [15]:   [16]: Wired has a piece [17] on the Autonomy Cube [18], the

in four museums around the world.
  [17]:   [18]: There was a mailing list discussion about building a router/gateway that
only allows Tor traffic. Lunar [19] and Rusty Bird [20] posted some
setups; both approaches basically creating a firewall whitelist of Tor
relay IPs from the consensus.
  [19]:   [20]: Yawning developed and released a Firefox addon [21] that detects
CloudFlare CAPTCHAs and automatically tries to fetch the page from
  [21]: Nick posted some ideas [22] on improving design and modularity in Tor.
  [22]: A TV producer is looking to interview [23] an "ordinary" Tor user. "I
think they want someone in the US they can follow around who uses Tor
for what they consider an interesting use case that fits the idea, 'Tor
is for everyone!'"
  [23]: The Logan Symposium posted their talk recordings [24]; they're all
really good, but the most Tor-related one is this discussion [25]
between the developers of a few Tor-enabled operating systems (Tails,
Qubes, and Subgraph).
