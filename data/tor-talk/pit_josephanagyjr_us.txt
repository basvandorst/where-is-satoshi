I hope not. For one, the irony would be too much and could possibly
destroy the world as we know it. Secondly, I already had to take my IM
and Mail programs off the network and use Safari for Grooveshark (and
the occasional FB app). I'm trying to use Tor more, not less.

1) You don't "bump" email messages. I don't know how your mail client
works but this isn't a message board.
2) The location of the nodes depends on the location of the people
allowing their computers to be used as nodes. It's all in the

I did, but even when I use 8118 (the control panel gives the port of
9051), I still have problems with both email and RSS retrieval.
In Pidgin, my IM client of choice, I have only a few problems (AIM and
ICQ says its been getting too many connect requests from me) setting it
to HTTP proxy with port 8118 (if this is an incorrect setting, I can
change it to socks5).
I'll try once again to set it as a socks5 proxy in Thunderbird 3. I was
just copying the settings that TorButton uses in Firefox 3.6b4.

I get all kinds of weird problems. The RSS poller acts up, connections
time out or not randomly, etc. OTOH, I have little to no problems
(except subscribing to or clicking on anything contained within RSS feed
that is available on the web page in question) with multiple field
settings in FF 3.6b4. Those problems aren't critical to my use of Tor
with FF though.
I never use the shorthand.
Compare this message with some of my older ones to the list and compare.
I already tried that and TorButton isn't compatible with TB (at least
not TB3).
no problem.

I can recreate the issues I'm having and then screen-cap the setting I
was using, if you think that would help.
I'd use such a program in association with Vidalia, but I might have
some issues since I use GPG to sign all outgoing mail. Which reminds me,
I need to set up GPG to use Tor when looking up keys.

That's pretty much what it does for me, leaves the feed stale (and
useless). I guess I'll have to get a third-party poller and use it in
the open.
Hrm. So tor automatically blocks smtp connections by default and there
is local leakage of DNS by TB3. Guess it's time to find a new mail
client. ):

I do, as most of my feeds are from a news paper (the Jerusalem Post, if
you're wondering, which seems to handle RSS weirdly anyway).
I imagine it's because even s-smtp isn't as secure as it could be.
I believe it's the same as listed in the Wiki for FF BUT in FF it
doesn't work (I cannot resolve the .onion example link for the Hidden
Wiki with it set to true) so I imagine in any version of TB it doesn't
work (reliably anyway).

Yes, hidden in the equivelant of about:config (options -> advanced ->
general tab -> config editor -> search for timeout). Timeouts seem big
enough (nothing under 100 seconds and that's for mailnews.tcptimout).

I just posted a short article on the settings to use when setting up
Pidgin and FF to use Tor. I tried to keep it simple, used screen shots
of the settings that I've been suggested to use and have had great
success in using to browse and IM across the Internets.
As I say in the closing lines of the entry, comments or corrections are
welcome in the comments section of the blog. Just thought I'd point
everyone to it:
I'll be following this up with an article on using GPG for further email
security and do an update when I find Tor and TB3 settings that don't
keep me from my email.
I'll also, in a future article, be discussing the use of OTR
(Off-the-Record), a chat encryption plugin for Pidgin and several other
clients (although since I'm only familiar with Pidgin, I'll be limiting
myself to its use with Pidgin).

I've seen it and even have a copy of the self-extractor on my system.
As for the documentation, it's like the other docs in that I've found
them too convoluted for the beginner (like me) to understand and I wind
up asking more questions then I really need to. Also, everything is so
spread out (wiki here, documentation there, etc.) it can be hard to find
any particular piece of information. I'm just aiming to provide a simple
"starter" element that the average user can understand as they become
more security conscious (which is the whole point of my privacy series
that I started with "The Privacy Mandate").
I want to provide explicitly beginner, non-developer instructions to the
n00bs, so to speak, in a language that they understand and I want them
to have to only go to one place to find them. Eventually I'm going to
collect all the posts into a series of static HTML files and post them
in a sub-folder, provide a zip- and rar-compressed text and html format
as well.
I'll definitely take a look at all that documentation and see what I can
glean from it to help me in my own goals. Thank you for the links. (:
Again, if there are any settings that could be tweaked to be better (or
are considered just absolutely wrong), feel free to let me know and I'll
update that particular post (or write an update linking to that one,
depending on how many intervening posts I have).

I use my email client (Thunderbird 3.0) to check my mail and handle most
of my RSS feeds (since sage is no longer an extension for Firefox). For
some reason I cannot read my feeds (they display as webpage in
Thunderbird with a link to bring me to the site if I want) when the
feeds are polled (the new topics are displayed but not readable). I get
an error saying that Tor is not an HTTP transport proxy or some such (I
forget the exact message, this happened hours ago). Right now I think I
have a connection setup that works, but I encountered another issue. I
cannot use Tor at all with my podcast catcher (Juice). It simply will
not read the RSS feed (I don't know what type of RSS it is) of one site,
and when I click on the mp3 to download from the site, I get an error
message from Tor.
Is this normal behavior? If so, why? This isn't covered in your online docs.

Hi All,
I just wanted you all to know that I've successfully migrated from
Microsoft Windows XP to FreeBSD 8.0 RELEASE. With this move will also
come updated information, if necessary, for connecting to Tor on FreeBSD
(so far the steps are the same, leaving the installation of the
appropriate packages as an exercise to the reader).
If anyone has any suggestions, the appropriate entries on my blog are
where you'll be able to leave comments for suggestions and updates to
anything I've already posted. As soon as I finish up here, I'll begin a
website (subdomain to one of my sites unless someone would like to
donate a domain (.org or .com)) to collect all the easy to understand
documentation in one place (static website). I'll be releasing the
documentation to the community under a CopyFree license[0-1] so there
won't be any issues over that.
Also, I'll consider setting up a hidden service as well, but I'll have
to talk to my brother-in-law first (he's the one currently in charge of
the router so he'll have to forward a port to me).
This is all unofficial, of course. I am in no way connected to the Tor
project except as a user of Tor (soon to be setting up Thunderbird,
Firefox and Pidgin on this box, haven't done it yet due to other
projects taking up my time).
