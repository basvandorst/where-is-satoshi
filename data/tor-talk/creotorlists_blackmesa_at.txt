@_subject: [tor-talk] Update for Tor Setup Instructions regarding Raspbian 
Hey guys,
on the docs say that:
I just found out that this is not necessarily true anymore,
at least not if you're running Raspbian on a Raspberry 2.
The Raspberry 2 features a ARM v7 CPU, which is perfectly
happy with the packages delivered from
At least I verified that this works like a charm using
Raspbian based on Debian Wheezy.
Somebody with editing rights may want to update the
web instructions to reflect this since it makes running
relays on Raspberries (at least Raspberry 2) an easy thing :)
all the best,

No, it does not.
You may be able to force the proxy operator to hand over your real
IP address since they also have to comply to law and regulation
based on the country they are operated in.
Also, a proxy may be compromised.
Due to onion routing, suing a relay operator won't get you such
information. Guard nodes know who is talking to them, but not where
they're going. Exit nodes know the destination of the communication,
but not who's the originator, and middle nodes are blessed with
ignorance on both ends. It's dangerous to hint people to use proxies
in order to get their locations hidden - their traces are just moved
to another system, they're not gone.

(edit: woops - long answer incoming :-)
I understand your frustration at that point, but Tor never stated to
be an "out-of-the-box panacea" that magically makes every step you take
anonymous. There are several caveats and hints in online documentation
and FAQs that point out what it protects ... and what not. While you're
right that the website does not scream "we can't protect you from giving
away your identity yourself" into your face in big red letters, it's
not making a secret of that fact on the other hand.
 is only
an example of many places where this is addressed.
We can't do anything against the fact that most people don't use proper
end-2-end encrypted protocols. We can't prevent YOLO users from giving
away identifying pieces information like email addresses, account names
etc. while using Tor.
The fact that some Tor users use us to connect to data collection like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. is not a novelty at all. The news
is that finally some of these companies are starting to realize that it
may be better to cooperate with Tor instead of fighting against it -
sure they do it for profit, but it will also contribute to Tor to some
extent, why not accept a Win-Win, even if it's caused by having an
unexpected temporary ally?
After all, I want to emphasize what str4d stated before: What if you
want to use a certain service, but you're prohibited from doing so by
a regime that won't let you use <$insert-commercial-website-here>?
This is where Tor provides you a great opportunity. The freedom to your communication partners. The rest is in the users hand - and there
are people out there (the Tor project, EFF, etc.) who really try to the non privacy-savvy folks about the SHOULD's and COULD's of privacy, rest is up to 'em.

But the pictures a little greater than "hiding something from
facebook" - it's about hiding the fact that you're visiting
that specific service in order to circumvent e.g. filters that
try to block that.
I have the feeling that the word "Facebook" triggers some sort
of "bite reflex" in this discussion - you can insert
$any_commercial_service_or_website instead.
And clear-name-policies or whatever do not change the fact that
you may use $service using a nym and you're fully in charge of
what information about your true identity you reveal.
A proxy might hide your location from $service-operator, but it
has this information at hand. Such proxy services make their money
with your privacy, but you don't have a guarantee that they won't
give away this information. Tor is about distributing parts of the
trust to multiple instances so each one of them needs to be trusted
less in the end. Proxies put the all the power to a single point.
I did indeed talk about them, you're right. Sorry for mentioning
that specifically, thought processes often mess up written text :-)
Indeed not, but it's much harder to compromise a chain instead
of a single instance like a proxy. That's why I described
"which part of a circuit knows what" again - I didn't do that
to imply that you're now aware of that, I wanted to support my
stance that it _seems to me_ it's a better approach to distribute
the trust-load to more than one entity.
Fair enough.
There's no reason to get cynical. After all this is not a
"my toy is better than yours" thing but an open debate where I
personally enjoy to learn about your point of view and therefore
get a bigger picture. I don't want to pick on your point of view,
it's just about having an argument where we bring in pros and cons,
there is no winner and no loser if we do it right, I hope we're
both clear on that :)
But to join in anyway: No magic involved. It's just another trust
model in my opinion. It may not be perfect, but my personal opinion
based on my experience is that proxy services have their own range
of application that might be a little different from Tors.
As long as it is transparent and works the way it should - aye.
Many protocols and technologies we use while we do our
everyday business on the internet are military- or gov. driven
or at least were initially created or funded that way.
I'm not a big fan of that either, .. but I'm lacking of alternatives
that can keep up with that. Many scientific papers and a lot of research
by scientists from all around the world went into Tor as it is today and
this is continuing so far. As a full time IT security researcher, this
adds to my trust in Tor, but that may be a personal thing and must not to anybody else though :-)
Once again, I'm enjoying the discussion as long as it adds value to
both sides, I hope thats also the case for you :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Kernel_OOPS_through_Tor_-_report_or_ignore?= 
Hej guys,
my Tor node crashed a few days ago. After I noticed the downtime
and connected to it, I found the linux kernel oops and left it
there since it seems debugging is still possible to some extent.
Message indicates that the problem was indeed Tor related,
the system is running on ARM.
Does it make sense to report the content of the oops notice and
if yes - would it help to let the system alone in this state in
case somebody comes up with further questions and certain commands
that may bring deeper insight, or is it better to just reboot the
node and continue the operation?
I'm asking because I'm not sure how "interesting" such information
may be .. not being a kernel guy at all reminds me of typical
Windows BlueScreens spewing out memory allocation ranges - nice
to have that information as a Windows Kernel Developer maybe, but
not for the usual userspace developer - so if its not worth the
wait, I'd better get the node up and doing some work again ;-)
Sanx for your input,

:-) Okay.
As long as we don't come up with a proper solution for
handling the proposed changes to the onion key
(aka. making it longer than 80 bits) there will be no
such thing as there are too many pitfalls ... but
I guess afraid that's another story :P
I'll definitely do that, ... don't trust that raspberry pi 2 anyway :)
Not on purpose - it's not a Kernel panic, just an oops, which threw me
into a kdb session, giving me debug opportunities I can not take any
advantage of because my pure lack of knowledge :-) But it's never too
late to learn something new I guess :P
Thanks for your input guys :)
