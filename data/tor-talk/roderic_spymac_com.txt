@_subject: Confusing (error?) messages for a none tech-saavy user. 
I have been running a Tor Client for a couple of months now and have
always received a lot of (error?) messages from the Tor console:
My questions are: What do they mean? Are they "dangerous"? Can they/do they need to be fixed? (I am currently running the 0.0.9rc7 client.)
If anyone could shed some light onto what they mean, I would be very great-full.
