@_subject: [tor-talk] "Invalid Server Certificate" accessing torproject.org on 
I searched google for people having problems accessing torproject.org
from Chrome on Windows, but I didn't see much besides a discussion on
December 21 about an outage
I can access torproject.org from Firefox on my windows (server 2003)
machine, but not from Chrome. I get an "Invalid Server Certificate"
error and it doesn't let me continue.  Any ideas what might be wrong
with my Chrome/Windows setup?
The details about the certificate says "The integrity of this
certificate cannot be guaranteed. The certificate may be corrupted or
may have been altered". It's issued to "*.torproject.org" and issued
by DigiCert High Assurance CA-3.
Broken combination:
*Windows Server 2003 w/ Chrome 16.0.912.63 m
*Not that I ever use IE, but testing this out: IE 8 on Server 2003
doesn't work. It says "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage".
I don't read much into this because it's in its default "hardened
security" setup where a lot of sites don't really work.
Working combinations:
*Windows Server 2003 w/ Firefox 9.0.1
*Mac w/ Chrome 16

well, this is certainly beyond my certificate debugging skill level.
Would engaging a Chrome mailing list be helpful?
Thanks for all the info so far,

I tried to attach a screenshot, but that put my message over the 50KB
needs-approval limit. See my message  below (minus the attachment).

Hi Andrew,
Thank you for taking a stab at this issue!  I just tried this now, and
it still doesn't work.  I don't remember precisely what the chain
looked, so I can't be sure I'm seeing anything different at all. I
restarted Chrome (but not Windows).  Both  and
trac.torproject.org show the same error.
The chain that I see now is:
*.torproject.org --> DigiCert High Assurance CA-3 --> DigiCert
(i've attached a screen shot of this.)
