Hash: SHA512
Asked a simple question on Online.net's hosting forum about whether or not
they permit Tor relays and exits. Administrator of the forum (co/vice-CTO
of the company) replies with this: (source
 )
"99% of its [Tor's] traffic is still pedopornography and piratery, so
morally we thinks it's a "bad thing" to use (you don't promote freedom of
expression to the cost of other freedoms and safety, especially in regards
to children...)"
Yeah, um, I use Tor every day for everything (same with most of you) and
I'm sure a large majority of us don't download kiddy porn. p2p is disabled
by default and torrenting/pirating media does not account for "99%" of Tor
network traffic.
"also police will probably ask us to lock your server for prosecutions
within a week .... this happens all the time (and it is very boring for
you and us)"
Online.net is based in France, and I'm pretty sure that nobody in France
has been locked up for running a Tor node.
"I should also show you (but sadly I am of course not allowed to...) some
of the pics we get with autorities requests, not very fun to see pictures
of kids abused every day you know... (yes, we do receive such requests
I laugh. Authorities aren't supposed to be able to show you the photos
they've found to make a request to take down a box, am I right? I thought
that went to a judge/court to get a legal order.
"PS: you should also expect a lot of incoming DDoS on your box ... (one
DDoS out of three these days are going to a ToR node ...)"
...but, your service absorbs all DDoS?!?! how is this an issue?!!?!
tl;dr i don't suggest using online.net for hosting tor exits. maybe relays.

@_subject: [tor-talk] securely run a hidden service 
i've seen snippets of post-silk road "how to securely run a hidden service" [1] [2] but i haven't found a large list of steps needed to be taken that would tremendously help to prevent de-anonymisation.
can someone point me to a large list of things that should be done (or make one!) to prevent this?
