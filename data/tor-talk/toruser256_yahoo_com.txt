@_subject: FreeCap and a Tor server  good combination? 
I?ve been running an Tor server (middleman only) for a while and I?ve been wondering about using FreeCap and an account on an SSH server that has a SOCKS proxy to tunnel my Tor server?s connections over an SSH tunnel to the SOCKS proxy running on that SSH server.  Hopefully I explained that clearly, if not maybe this will help to visualize it:
      TOR Server ? FreeCap ? SSH Tunnel ? SOCKS proxy ? [Out to internet]   I have tried testing this and it works.  Clients are able to connect to my TOR server, and in trying it myself there is no noticeable increase in latency (ping time to the SSH server is < 15ms, and the server has a fast CPU and faster network connection).  As far as I can tell, based on netstat and the like, when I client connects to my server, their circuit is built through the SSH tunnel and then to the SOCKS proxy server, and then out on the internet to the next Tor server in the circuit.  When data comes back to my Tor server, it first comes through the SOCKS proxy on to the SSH tunnel, and then to my Tor server, then to the client or other Tor server in the chain.
    I get the feeling that this should be more secure because:
  My ISP can?t monitor my Tor server?s outgoing connections.
  Even of the SSH/SOCKS server?s connection was monitored, other peoples Tor circuits should be mixed in with my Tor server?s connections.
Any thoughts on this?     Also, just so there is no confusion, I am an authorized user of the SSH/SOCKS server, and I am not under any bandwidth or CPU usage constraints.  My access to the server is very fast and the tiny bit of latency seems trivial.  I?m only interested in the security implications of this approach.  Thanks!

@_subject: Tor client over a SOCKS proxy, and Tor client running through another Tor Circuit 
I?m wondering what the anonynimity implications the following:    1) Running Tor using Freecap:  By this I mean running a Tor client and using FreeCap to transparently redirect all of Tor?s network connections through a SOCKS proxy.  This seems to work, and ?feels? just like using Tor in the standard way, and is useful for getting around transparently filtered network environments where running a Tor client doesn?t work.  Is this any more or less secure and anonymous than running a Tor client normally?
      2) Running Tor over Tor using Freecap:  This is the same as above, but instead of using some arbitrary SOCKS server, another Tor client is used as the SOCKS server.  This means that the Tor circuit is routed through another Tor circuit.  I tried this and it (of course) increased latency, but what are the anonynimity  and security effects? NOTE: I understand that running a Tor circuit over an existing Tor circuit will put additional load on the Tor network, but I doubt a few kb/s of basic web surfing or instant messenger would hurt.

Thanks for the response.  Just to clarify, I wasn't refering to routing other users circuts through the Tor network again, just the requests from a single Tor client running on my computer, and what the security implications of that would be.  I don't really have any intention of routing all my Tor circuts through another Tor client that I'm also running - I'm just curious about the effects it would have...
  re: 1) Since we're talking about a single client used on a sporatic basis, I don't think that an extra 500KB per month would be a bandwidth issue...
  re:2) Assuming I used the ExcludeNodes directive to prevent that kind of looping, do you think this would still be a bad thing from a security standpoint?
  re:3) Also, why do you say it doesn't increase anonynimity?
  re:4) I had just that idea, and started a thread on this list about it a few hours ago:   Thanks for your input :)
    I don't think re-routing users through tor is good because:
  1. It increases network load
  2. They could end up in a very long loop with you as the exit point several times
  3. It doesn't increase anonymity (perhaps generating cover traffic would be better)
  4. Why don't you have your server fetch some SOCKS proxies from google and then route users through those instead?

Sure, here is the diagram:
  my web browser-->privoxy-->tor1-->tor2--> internet
  tor1 is a Tor instance running in client mode and started using FreeCap.  All of its internet connections are transparently redirected through tor2 by FreeCap, using SOCKS.  tor2 is another instance of Tor running in client mode that is acting as a SOCKS server for tor1.  tor2 has no special configuration changes and is NOT run through FreeCap.
  On a related note, if you have any comments on this thread, they would be appreciated:     Well, I'm fine with the network load personally but I know people get hate mail for network load.
  I guess I'm a little confused as to what exactly you're trying to do. Can you possibly draw a diagram such as this:
  my client-->tor-->tor loop 2 --> internet
  I'm a little confused here.
  As for increasing anonymity, the attacks that work against tor such as end-to-end or timing attacks simply won't be slowed down by routing through more tor nodes since each node can't really reveal where your connection came from (to my knowledge). It does work on normal socks proxy chains because they aren't blind and many keep logs.   Ringo

I'm not clear what you mean by " It loses security as one endpoint is being used", could you expound on it?  In the setup I was describing, the Tor circuits still go through the same number of Tor routers, and since my Tor server is just a middleman, nobody is exiting at the SOCKS server that I used SSH to tunnel to... Basically, my server's connections to other Tor servers are tunneled through SSH to some SOCKS server instead of just going directly to the next Tor router in the circuit. Thanks.
 It loses security as one endpoint is being used. Tor uses multiple endpoints for sucessive connections to avoid tracking a connection.

Yes, I understand that anyone monitoring the SOCKS server could see my (middleman only) Tor server's connections to other Tor Servers, but wouldn't tunneling through this SSH/SOCKS server mean that an attacker would have to be able to monitor the SOCKS server (to see where my server is connecting to) as well as monitoring my computer (to see where the connections to my server came from)?
 Because anyone observing the SOCKS server will be able to see what you are doing just as well as if it was your computer.
