Maybe, that's the reason why some people using tor will be hold by paypal. Two different ip address of login and logout
I wonder if the paypal website script can detect who use proxy or tor for the reason of fraud?
MANY THANKS

A month ago PayPal took my account hostage because
they fantasised to have reason to believe a third
person had access to it.
There were no unauthorised transactions,
therefore I'm sure it's a false alarm.
Of course they didn't tell me their reason,
but I assume it's a stupid one. I wouldn't be
surprised if it was because a change
of exit nodes while I was logged in.

I am a newbie in tor, I wonder if there are any method to control the number of my router. I think too many nodes will limit the speed, Maybe i only need two nodes.
Many thinks

  No, you can not choose the path length.  Besides you should not use any less than 3 nodes.    Anogeorgeo,
