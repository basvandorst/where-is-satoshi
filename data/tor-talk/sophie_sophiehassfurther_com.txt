@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy seems to connect to the same exit node again 
Dear TorBirdies!
I love TorBirdy.
That said, I have an odd problem using TorBirdy with Thunderbird. Since
yesterday, Thursday 9th, around 9am (that is daylight saving time +1h)
TorBirdy/Thunderbird shows some strange behaviour. Sometimes it just
works, but often I keep getting the same alert when trying to send emails:
"An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: 5.7.1
Service unavailable; client (176.108.160.214) blocked using
mail.badip.de Please check the message recipient xxxxx at xxxxxxxxxx.com
and try again."
So what I find strange, is that since two days TorBirdy seems to connect
to the same exit node whenever I login. When I check the Tor Browser
though, it says I am connected to Tor, showing a different (!) IP address.
I am not a very technical person, so maybe this is all expected
behavior, but I thought I'll ask. I hope this doesn't make me look like
an idiot
Below is the Thunderbird troubleshooting info, I have crossed out my in-
and outgoing server, as well as the (deactivated) plugins.
Thanks in advance

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy seems to connect to the same exit node 
Thanks Sukhbir Singh for clarifying, thanks justaguy for the suggestion!
My assumption was, that TorBirdy and Tor are connecting to the same exit
node. What I didn't make clear in my first mail, was that my fix
initially was to choose a new identity. And then things got complicated.
When choosing a new identity in TorBrowser, I thought I was also
choosing a new identity in TorBirdy. I was/am still receiving the alert
quite frequently, even right after clicking on "new identity" (it is
always the same IP that gets rejected, sending emails to various
recipients). So that is what caused my confusion. Do I have to "choose a
new identity" from within TorBirdy?
What I didn't mention before is, that refreshing my inbox worked at all
times. But that might have to do with my mail server, right?
Just had the same alert again when trying to send this email. Restarting
TorBrowser seemed to do the trick... but now I can't really replicate
this. Hm.
Thanks for your help, guys.

Hi Leeroy,
Thanks for the reply!
I am using the latest Tor Browser bundle (4.0.8), and checked the
signature before installing. Updating does not work for me anymore, I
have to upgrade to a new machine and newer OSX, will do asap.
I think what you describe might be correct - so far choosing a new
identity in Tor did not work for me, but restarting the Tor Browser
worked. So maybe some circuits did not close?
Just a general question: is it normal to get connected to the same exit
node almost all the time, when I start my mail program?
Thanks for the support everyone

Hello Malte,
I already did, before sending an email to the list ;)
Basically they only blocked that one exit - for some security reason. I
have been using TorBirdy for quite a while, worked with my mail provider
until Thursday.
So as long as I restart Tor, I can be a "new identity" and send my
email. It works for the time being, if this stops working, I will spam
you again with my questions!
Thanks everybody for the support

Hi Leeroy,
Thanks for looking into my troubleshooting info and all the in depth
info. Actually using the default port 587 works, and I can't figure out
why and when I ever changed this setting to port 25. *rolleyes*
This was my gut feeling, thanks for pointing it out.
How do I look up which ports work on which exit nodes? I tried searching
Atlas, but I didn't find out how to do a reverse search.
I will keep track of the exit nodes TorBirdy connects to, to find out
whether the problem persists. Thanks to goofyzrnssm for reminding me how
to do so and for forwarding the detailed instructions from security in a
As for OS: I am currently on an older version of OSX, but with no
intention to
stick with it (for many reasons, mainly the phone home problem in
yosemity). So my whole setup will change soonish.
As for
The torrc files are ok.
Yes, this has always reset the exit node.
Thanks to everyone involved for your help. It is much appreciated!

Hello Leeroy,
Cool! Thank you! Works like a charm :)
Terminal commands are becoming my favorite. They sort of remind me of
writing games with my brother from some books he had. Boy was he cool.
Thanks again to everyone involved, looking into my little torbirdy world
and replying and suggesting fixes!!!

Hi Leeroy
Yes, I tried "25" or "port 25" in Atlas' search, but did not get any
results... it seemed like the most intuitive place to look for port
info. Searching in the local database did not occur to me, before you
mentioned it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy seems to connect to the same exit node 
Hi Leeroy,
Yes, Atlas was a poor choice. Before you suggested searching the log
through Terminal, I wasn't even thinking of that possibility.
As for improvements: I think a) would be quite important. Using a better
port worked, as far as I can tell, and I was not aware that I put myself
in a very bad position when choosing port 25. But then my life is not
depending on TorBirdy, while other peoples' lives do, so maybe a hint in
the "Before using TorBirdy" advice or a warning message from within
TorBirdy could help those who are not tech-savvy.
Options b) and c) would be very luxurious, but option a) really solved
my problem, and seems quite important for those who come from a
different background.
Other things that come to mind:
"Test proxy settings" could be somewhere more prominent, for users like
me :) I am the kind of person that does not disable the warning message
that pops up when clicking on the TorBirdy preferences.
I am -manually- logging what exit ports TorBirdy uses, out of curiosity.
I will keep you posted in case something weird happens again.
Thanks for the help!

Hi guys,
What you explained is a little over my head. Also my capacities are very
limited at the moment. I will look into it, soon!

@_author: Sophie Hassfurther 
@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy seems to connect to the same exit node 
Hi Leeroy,
If I would like to suggest to add a warning to the "Before using
TorBirdy", where would be the right place to do so?
I am not sure I understand you correctly:
Are you referring to the warning message I got?
Would you define failure to use an exit as a) not being able to send
emails over this exit and therefor establishing a connection to a new
exit or as b) when I get a warning saying "blocked using mail.badip.de"?
Because from how I understand this, and please correct if I am wrong,
TorBirdy might connect to a different exit, when the current exit
doesn't support the port I am using.

Hi Yuri,
Thanks for all your input/suggestions. It is really helpful to see
things from various perspectives!
I like the idea of Whonix/Qubes or other VMs, but with my limited skills
I wouldn't consider that a safe option. Simply because I can not
maintain it.
So if I were to be dealing with extremely sensitive info, that could
possibly put me or others at danger, I would probably go for a
physically and locally isolated solution. Or communicate face to face.
Without bringing any devices. Obviously.
Thanks again,

Okey, you made me think twice, I will give the VM machine idea a chance.
That is, once I have the resources to do so. I spend way too much time
in front of a screen nowadays.

Hi Lluis,
I suppose you are using the Enigmail add-on. In the Torbirdy wiki [0]
the developers state that
"Enigmail is supported and is safe to use with TorBirdy (...) but you
will not be able to use Enigmail for communicating with keyservers until
we find a HTTP -> SOCKS5 shim."
The idea is to not leak location information. Disabling TorBirdy to
fetch the keys kind of defeats that purpose.
There are two workarounds that I know of, if you want/have to use
1) Look up the key manually, check fingerprint, copy the long block of
gibberish that starts with -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- to the
Now go to your mail program, choose Enigmail -> manage keys -> edit ->
import key from clipboard.
2) use gpg with curl support (Linux/OSX only). This is explained in the
TorBirdy wiki as well [0]
Scroll down to Additional Add-Ons -> Enigmail.

Thanks for sharing.
My favorite quote:
"The deepest problem is that the system architecture that has evolved in
recent years holds masses of information on many people with no
intelligence value, but with vast potential for political abuse."
This is what it all boils down to for me: Security issues are largely a
political problem. Separation of Powers, Freedom of Speech. Although
both concepts are more than 200 years old, we still have to have this
discussion. Technology can only do so much to fix this.

Thanks for keeping an eye on the statistics!
I just looked at their official website
and did a search for "tor" on both the German and the English version.
The English site produced a couple of useless hits (factor, doctoral,
etc.). The hits on the German site were not exactly more exciting,
mostly related to soccer :) "Tor" means goal in German.
The department for computer science has a different website [1] Their
annuals reports [2] show some interesting research on onion routing and
threat modeling.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Astoria Tor client is said to be better than 
Hi Rishab,
Rishab Nithyanand:
I had the same impression. I do not know the author, but I read your
paper and checked it back with the article [1]. It made me think that
the latter is quite inaccurate. Even when journalists are well meaning,
they sometimes tend to over-simplify in an effort to put things in terms
that people will understand.
The most striking part of the article for me was this:
"A full 58 percent of Tor circuits are vulnerable to network-level
attackers, such as the NSA or Britain?s Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ), when they access popular websites, according to new
research from American and Israeli academics. Chinese users are the most
vulnerable of all to these kinds of attacks, with researchers finding
85.7 percent of all Tor circuits from the country to be vulnerable.
Even though Tor is designed to provide complete anonymity to its users,
the NSA?s position means they can potentially see and measure both
traffic entering the Tor network and the traffic that comes out. When an
intelligence agency can see both, simple statistics help an autonomous
system at their control match the data up in a timing attack and
discover the identity of the sender.
Anonymity over."
The author makes it sound as if all Tor traffic was vulnerable to
attacks by the infamous agencies in two out of three times. And looking
into my magic crystal ball, I know which media will quote that exact
fallacy as a fact and exploit it.
I read your paper, but I am not sure I comprehended it. From how I
understand it, this section of the Dailydot article should read
something like:
A full 58 percent of the *times* Tor creates a circuit, it creates it in
such a way that, *if* a potential adversary, such as the NSA or
Britain?s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), operates the
relays chosen in an autonomous system, they could deanonymize users who
access popular websites, according to new research from American and
Israeli academics. Chinese users are the most vulnerable of all to these
kinds of attacks, with researchers finding 85.7 percent of all Tor
circuits from the country to be vulnerable.
Then he goes on about what intelligence agencies can do, not taking into
account, that they would have to operate a huge part of Tor to achieve
the 58 or 85.7 percent he quotes earlier. This is critical, as it
becomes more and more difficult to own a large part of this network, due
to its decentralized nature and due to the fact that Tor grows.
Am I mistaken?
This is a very complex matter, but *if* I understood the paper
correctly, I think it is quite a hip research, and interesting
conclusions are drawn.
