@_subject: Keep getting the same entry nodes 
Thnx Bluestar,
Although I don't fully grasp the logic of that piece, I understand
that tor was meant to act this way. So I assume I'm fine.   ----- Original Message -----

  Hello, I keep getting connected to the same entry nodes. They seem
  to be chosen from a small group of four or five servers. I tried
  adding an exclude line in my torrc file but that did not make a
  difference (did not work).
  Shouldn't the choise of severs be random?
  Is this something to worry about?
  Ralph
