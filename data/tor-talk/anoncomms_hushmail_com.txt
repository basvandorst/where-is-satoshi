@_subject: [tor-talk] Odd connection probles in Tails 0.10 
It seems all network connections, except trought the browser are now
failing, though tehy had previously worked.
This is a pretty deep software stack so not quite sure where it's
breaking down but, the initial issue with a Ruby script which does
some HTTP transactions getting "Connection Refused" errors for sites I
can access in a browser (in fact seems to be for all TCPSocket.open
netcat and ssh are also both imediately failing with "Connection
refused" errors, tcpdump on the tails system doesn't seem to show any
traffic so I'm thinking  this is being reject by some part of the
local software stack before it hits the external interface.
Any thoughts on where to look, can't think what would differ between
iceweasel and ruby here?  It's possible a reboot would fix things, but
I'd rather try and really fix things first.
