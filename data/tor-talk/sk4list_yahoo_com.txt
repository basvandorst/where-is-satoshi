Could it be that for some reason or the other, all
directory servers are down?

Tor talks at WTH:
Following are the full length video of talks at WTH
(whatthehack.org) that deals with Tor. Would be great
if someone could make a bittorrent of them so that we
don't DoS "rehash".
Roger Dingledine's Tor talk
Panel: "Future anonymity networks"
Tutorial(?): "How to build your untraceable home page"
(video still not up)

@_subject: Gentoo's response on them blocking access to their forums via Tor 
So, they still won't differentiate between browsing
forums and posting on them. As for "technical or legitimate reason[10]", since I
can't seem to reach the website (without Tor) this may
have to been discussed, what about a situation where I
as a developer or an advanced user of Gentoo have a
fundamentally different opinion on a core issue from
some demigod core developer of Gentoo and who wants to
silence me or worse identify me? Don't want to state
examples, but hasn't these things happened before?
Maybe someone who is in touch with the Gentoo guys
could ask them?

@_subject: Tor client and OR knowledge 
As a tor client user, is there any option I can toggle
to get a debug of the names of the tor servers I am
using to build my circuit over a period of time?

Hi Roger,
What am I supposed to see, and where am I supposed to
see it?
In the telnet window I get:
telnet localhost 9051
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
250 OK
SETEVENTS CIRC
250 OK
In the tor debug window I get:
[notice] Tor v0.1.1.5-alpha. This is experimental
software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity
[notice] Initialized libevent version 1.1a using
method epoll. Good.
[notice] connection_create_listener(): Opening Socks
listener on 127.0.0.1:9050
[notice] connection_create_listener(): Opening Control
listener on 127.0.0.1:9051
[notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks
like it's working.

@_subject: Tor nodes question 
1 and 2 - use entrynodes, exitnodes StrictExitNodes
and StrictEntryNodes, making sure that entry and exit
nodes are in different continents. Check out for a
list of tor nodes by country:
As for 3, if all the Tor servers are controlled by the
adversary, you are indeed traceable.

@_subject: forums.gentoo.org = blocked for Tor users 
They seem to be blocking all connections from Tor ORs,
as identified by their IP addresses. I don't think
they actually go through the trouble of seeing which
ORs have exit policy that allows port 80 use. So a
middle-man node's IP address would also most probably
be in the block list.

@_subject: Torpark - AVG trojan alert 
Sorry for using this list for torpark help.
When I tried to unzip Torpark zip file downloaded from CORAL mirror
 AVG Virus scanner gave me a warning about
Dropper.Generic.AGX trojan for both torkill.exe and torpark.exe
Anyone had similar experience? AVG defines a dropper trojan as 'This file itself isn't infected,
but can drop a boot virus to the system area of your disk or diskette'. Should we be worried?
