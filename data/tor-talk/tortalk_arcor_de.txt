@_subject: [tor-talk] Did Australian Authorities hack (US) computers with 
I found two articles which may have something in common. 1. Some Tor users (29.000) got deanonymized by authorities while up/downloading childporn. 2. Someone claims that "Tor suddenly dump over 30 megabloats of steaming faeces onto a file system on exit".
1. Is it just a question of time when other deanonymisations will come public?
"Australian Authorities Hacked Computers in the US
Written by Joseph Cox Contributor
August 15, 2016 // 10:10 AM EST
By the very virtue of the investigation, Australian authorities likely would not have known where the computer they wanted to hack was located; indeed, that was the exact problem that the Tor network presented.
    Whether the Australian authorities hacked computers in other countries remains unclear.
It is unclear on what authority Australian law enforcement obtained a warrant, or whether one was obtained at all to gather IP addresses from Piccolo and others in the US. Task Force Argos declined to answer any questions or comment for this story.
Whether using a hacking tool to grab the real IP address of a Tor user constitutes a search in a legal sense has recently become a contentious issue in the US. Several judges have said that suspects do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy around their IP address when using the Tor network, meaning that it is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, and a hack grabbing it would not require a warrant. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well as some courts, have argued otherwise.
2. The author embedded a list of his findings in his article.
"Tor 6.0.4
Why does Tor suddenly dump over 30 megabloats of steaming faeces onto a file system on exit?
Most of the junk left behind comes from an EFF extension, but this extension has been used all along, and it serves no purpose to copy the data out to yet another location. If this is caused by an error at EFF, why hasn't this been corrected?"

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Quantum computing be the end of Tor and all 
Hello Torusers,
may i join your discussion with my minimal understanding of that matter about quantum computer and encryption.
There are two runs to evolve "computing": the quantum net and the brain net.
Once you have one quantum computer you have a cloud of them, a quantum network. The disadvantage for the quantum computing for now is you have to program that thing for each task and its documentation. If you want to use the time of today's quantum computer you have to document each step of your program, like an audit before using, to be sure you can use the quantum computer after loaning.
The brain net already exists and is to evolve. They connected up to three brains of apes to let them solve a problem one ape couldn't do on its own. First they connected rat brains:
"Received:    03 March 2015"
Then they connected nonhuman primate brains:
"Received:    11 March 2015"
In Davos "neuroscientists" discuss the usage of brains and thoughts e. g. in courtrooms:
"Davos 2016 - What If: Your Brain Confesses? "
I want to put your eyes and especially ears to these words:
There is up to date no law besides basic human rights (ha ha e. g. Guantanmo, CIA torture report else) that prevents them to steal your thoughts, there is no legal protection. Assuming they are able to do "read someones mind" even in the future. And keep that in mind when you do trade agreements like TiSA, TTIP, TPP or else. When they trade thoughts which could not be protected by (actual) copyrights because they did not need to be "human thoughts". And don't let them push it into the conspiracy area to let them have more time before the protective law exists.
Considering the encryption to these high advanced new networks. If they want to read your thoughts you can litteraly "stonewall" them thinking of a "stonewall" even if they say don't think about [color] [animal]. But what do you do with encryption against quantum computers? That is tricky.
When you shuffle cards or words or dices to en/decrypt. Someone else could shuffle them, too. The same way. There is always someone who is more advanced with the hands or knows the trick being in the same "magic circle" while magicians only tell the trick to other magicians.
But there was a film with a nice hint:
"The final "hack your own brain" sequence has also been similarly edited with the inclusion of altered dialogue."
The encryption of a file was made by pictures. I think there where three pictures as decryption code in a certain order. Well, what if you shuffle up to all pictures stored at e. g. facebook into your encryption? Storage isn't the problem but reading/writing speed is. Have you ever opened a random file with an editor which was not meant for properly reading the file. If you are lucky you could read some words around all these chars. You could just start to send a picture or a stego pic in a pic or a vid in a vid to advance the encryption. Or you just need a certain pixel (or rendering) within a pic made with a really hightech cam.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Authority Search and 4th Amendment 
Hello Toruser,
you may be interested in reading this article:
"First, several readers pointed out that the government actually has made this argument. You can read the governments argument here in the Michaud case (pages 6-7) and here in the Lemus case (pages 8-12). My apologies for the misstatement, and thanks to reader Jonathan Mayer for sending on the briefs.
Second, some readers argued that a Tor user loses a reasonable expectation of privacy in IP addresses because the user must disclose his true IP address to Tor. This is essentially the argument the government (briefly) makes in Michaud: By using Tor, you are sending your IP address to Tor, which is ultimately hosted by an unknowable collection of strangers who are running Tor exit nodes. You have put out your IP address to lots of people, which means that you have no expectation of privacy in it.
But if the police fail in their efforts, and the only way they can get the information is by accessing a Fourth-Amendment-protected space, then accessing that space is a search."
I doubt there is such a law for whistleblower, terrorists, "copyright infringer" and (Tor) user. While the whistleblower and "copyright infringer" e. g. him, him, him and hers have the same prosecutor, confirmed by him, him and kim, some laws didn't apply to US authorities and their contractors and some laws only have to be complied by US (law) fugitives on some lists they never know they are life long at.

Hi Torusers,
due to the subject:
"Privacy, Anonymity, and Individuality The Final Battle Begins HQ - HOPE XI 2016"
Some of you might already know that but some might be newcomers and in case you missed HOPEcon. As if intels have a problem getting (new) agents:
"disposable agents" in terms of "you use an agent once", you can't use that person again b/o cover burning
A human "agent" can't be nearer than once own device and tracker, and a human brain can't record the same way technic can. And in addition to that speech i recommend "watch the watchers":
"People working for intelligence contractors, the military, and intelligence agencies frequently mention secret codewords and surveillance programs in public resumes. These resumes are useful for uncovering new surveillance programs, learning more about known codewords, identifying which companies help with which surveillance programs, "
PS OT: 1. And in case you know so whose nose runs you just open a water-tap, with the temperature you are convenient with, the colder the better, hold one or both hands beneath, form a bowl, collect the water, stick the nose into it, slowly snuffle the water and stop before you waterboard yourself, hold it for a moment, release it and do it again if you need/wish. What it does? You get water into the nose so your body doesn't have to. You free your nose from foreign matter (e. g. pollen). If it is cold water you sniffle your blood vessels will shrink.
2. Rambam recommends to vote for Trump in the video. If you want to change a system you should not support it, it only last longer. Or if you think you can hit the system by voting you should vote the worst with the least competence and experience. As if you have to do an audit on a software you don't know, you don't even know how to program. This would not hit America as such while you will stay with all companies avoiding taxes, destroying environment (air [coal], water [underwater oil], earth [fracking]) and employing every year less. That is a global effect.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Did Hackers got hacked with "tor nodes for MitM Jabber 
Hi Torusers,
this might be of interest:
"Liverman does not believe that was the case however, and that the FBI used illegal tactics to aid in their arrests. The method he believes that they employed are in line with the highly controversial amendments to Rule 41, which would allow for the agency to hack and surveil an unlimited number of computers and devices globally, without a warrant. These amendments are not currently law, as the deadline for Congress to strike it down is December 1.
They mentioned something about me and Cracka using similar tor nodes, so its possible that they utilized their malicious tor nodes for MitM Jabber servers which we mostly used to communicate, Liverman detailed.
The amendments also remove jurisdiction limitations, allowing the FBI to obtain a search warrant in, for instance, Virginia and then hack computers across the country using Network Investigative Techniques (NITs). "

Hi Torusers,
maybe this is of interest:
"Such leaks are nothing new  I reported on leaky server-status pages on regular sites in 2012 and on the Dark Web earlier this year  but they continue to be a problem.
Server status pages are generated by the Apache web servers mod_status module to help people understand how their sites are performing. Leaks occur when the pages are inadvertently made available to the rest of us."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser switch from disable to enable plugins 
Hi Torusers,
there is a notice:
Torbrowser enables plugins such as flash/shockwave "on its own" from disabled status. You don't get asked to confirm, "it just does". A Tor user only notices that switch by seeing this grey icon flash. But that icon only appears at sites you visit with e. g. provided flash it can play but can't (grey). It seems you have to open the Tools Add-ons plugins tab while browsing to see that switch in time.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Richard Chirgwin @ theregister.co.uk: "Judge orders FBI 
Hi Torusers,
maybe of some interest:
"The case is one of several the Feds are pursuing against more than 100 alleged users of the child sex abuse material exchange network called the Playpen. The prosecutions have become test grounds over investigators' use of hacking tools to unmask Tor users  Playpen was hidden in the Tor network and agents injected tracking software into Playpen visitors' browsers to identify users.
The Playpen investigation also sparked last year's controversy over Carnegie-Mellon University's part. It was accused of revealing de-anonymisation research to the FBI in 2014, and last November said it wasn't paid for the research, but rather, served with a subpoena."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Senior US District Judge Leon Jordan rules against FBI 
Hi Torusers,
Motherboard's writer Joseph Cox had a "good guess":
"Basically, Playpen must have set their [child pornography] site to [a] default [web server setting], meaning if you typed in the IP address you could see the Playpen site, Thomas White, a UK-based activist and technologist, explained in an encrypted chat. Whereas if they set another default like server not found, then you could only access Playpen by typing the correct .onion address. This means that law enforcement could verify that an IP address belonged to a specific site.
An FBI Agent, acting in an undercover capacity, accessed IP address 192.198.81.106 on the regular Internet and resolved to TARGET WEBSITE, the document continues. That address pointed to a server in North Carolina, hosted by a company called CentriLogic.
The FBI was tipped off about Playpens IP address by a foreign law enforcement agency, as noted in other, redacted versions of the warrant. This recently unsealed version includes detail on how that IP address was left exposed."
As i quoted here they are scanning for mistakes, however, almost everybody does, today:
"Server status pages are generated by the Apache web server’s mod_status module to help people understand how their sites are performing. Leaks occur when the pages are inadvertently made available to the rest of us.""
You can't have a quality management without data collection in first place for optimization. As if humans are in urgend need for being better.
I wonder why there is no report that CMU got "hacked" (bribed or payed at lest) to get the subpoenaed knowledge to deanonymize Tor users. I mean Tor is deved and used by mil and then by persons with mostly clearances. Did Hillary's server got identified after or before Playpen?
Was it a mere media outburst to tell everyone, certain persons like: The FBI can deanonymize Tor users with chporn now, too? Or more like: "We" know you if you use Tor. And why do you need Tor for onion sites anyway (Tor2web):
"How to access .onion sites without using Tor Browser "

@_subject: [tor-talk] IoT Scanner - feedback for Tor (Exit) Nodes configuration 
Hello Torusers,
Not only. Otherwise you can't tell if there is a power plant on that port, a fridge or a toaster...or a Tor Node/User.
There is link on the site referring to
"Websites are just one part of the Internet. There are power plants, Smart TVs, refrigerators and much more that can be found with Shodan!"
Take a look what is happening these days, please. A toaster was hacked within one hour since connected to the internet:
"We built a fake web toaster, and it was compromised in an hour."
And you could get a slightly bigger picture with that article:
"Earlier this year, researchers from security firm Trend Micro collected more than 54 million pages over a four-month span using low-cost hardware. In some cases, the messages alerted recipients to unsafe conditions affecting mission-critical infrastructure as they were detected. A heating, venting, and air-conditioning system, for instance, used an e-mail-to-pager gateway to alert..."
Imagine, when a company shuts its doors after selling IoTs, these products (Satellites, EDPCs, bulbs, toaster, USB, akku, cars, drones...) will not get a (licenced) update to be protected from hacking or prohibited from sending alert msgs and assimilated by a borgnet. And as you can guess with 54 million alert pages companies reduce their employees and forget that some chaperoned IoTs alerts. Sometimes it is just easier/cheaper/faster to plug new things to the net than to repair the old.
I could not tell which is more worse to deanonymize a Tor user or to find such anonymous IoTs to switch on for someones own use.

Hello David Bodnaraszek,
there was a similar issue 11 months ago:
"  closed defect (fixed)
Crashing on Windows 10 Fault Module Name: d2d1.dll
Fault Module Version: 6.1.7601.17514
So the workaround for users who don't want to wait for the next release is to create the file Messenger/TorMessenger/Data/Browser/profile.default/prefs.js with the following two lines:
user_pref("gfx.direct2d.disabled", true);
user_pref("layers.acceleration.disabled", true);"
Your version seems up to date:
"Nom du module défaillant : d2d1.dll, version : 10.0.10586.589,"
Either your version is défectueuse and you just save the old and replace it with same version. Or maybe you will downgrade the dll version until a more advanced version is released (if you didn't got the issue with Tor before).
Please visit a site of your trust to get the version you need of d2d1.dll and save your old for a backup before replacing it. "d2d1.dll, File description: Microsoft D2D Library"
