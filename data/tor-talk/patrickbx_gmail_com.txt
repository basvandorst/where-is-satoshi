@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about Circuit Building 
I was logging some traffic from the Orweb browser on Android (to check for
DNS leaks) and noticed that 5 different Tor relay IP addresses were being
contacted. I was curious if this represents 5 different possible circuits
with some being marked as unused, or alternatively if some of these IPs
were actually hops in the Tor circuit (beyond the first).
I ask because my initial conception would be that you wouldn't want to be
able to see each IP in the Tor circuit you are using as because then
someone could identify the exit node you are using. I am just curious if
anyone could clarify this point.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot Data Overhead 
I made a blog post  on
the Guardian site about the data cost incurred by Orbot usage. It generally
seems quite manageable for most use cases. Running in the backround 24/7
for 30 days does incur ~200MB of idle usage which would be significant for
mobile users with smaller data plans. Check out the post for more details.
I'm also curious if anyone has taken similar measurements with Tor to
compare the results.

It depends on what you use it for. If you are using it with specific
applications that support proxying, you can just turn Orbot on as you
need to, this probably won't inccur very much extra data usage.
Worst case scenario, if you leave Orbot running 24/7(~200MB a month)
and all your data has high overhead (web traffic) you would only be
able to use about a little less then 200MB of your plan. You could
gain an extra 100 MB back by running Orbot 12 hours a day.

Hi Roger,
I looked at traffic from the latest Orbot (2.3.10-alpha) vs an older
release (2.2.14-alpha) and found that idle usage was reduced. The latest
Orbot used ~65 bytes/s while the older version used ~91 bytes/sec. An idle
data reduction of around 30%. Does that sound reasonable?
That blog post now has incorrect statistics so I will update it to reflect
the lower usage.
