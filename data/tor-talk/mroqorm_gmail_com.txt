@_subject: [tor-talk] Operation Onymous against hidden services, 
seems to be more shitty opsec than anything else:
 : FBI found the
Silk Road 2.0 server via unspecified means. The admin used his real
email and IP address to manage it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Operation Onymous against hidden services, 
operations that involve multiple stings carried out simultaneously are
nothing new
sure, parallel construction is a problem, also in the SR 1.0 case, but
let's not get ahead of ourselves and call tor into question again
just seems as if the druggy hipsters are worse at opsec than the kiddy
porn people
just imagine the positive press for LE if they SAVED THE CHILDREN

@_subject: [tor-talk] Operation Onymous against hidden services, 
that is indeed worrying o_O looking forward to a tpo blog post with
more details ... and hidden service spec & implementation updates too
where was that warning again ...
"This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity." -_-

@_subject: [tor-talk] passing a URL to Tor browser 
2014-11-20 16:47 GMT+00:00 Hartmut Haase :
since tor browser is a fork of firefox, but shouldn't interfere with
the running system's firefox, it's a little complicated. you can't
have both running at the same time, opening links from different
as of tor browser 4.0 there's the -allow-remote argument you can pass
to it, to support opening links when clicking on them in a chat client
for instance. you will need to copy/edit the start script though (not
sure how tor browser starts on windows/mac), or if you use linux, just
pass it like ./start-tor-browser -allow-remote
once tor browser is started with -allow-remote, if your system is
configured to open links with firefox, they will open in tor browser
instead of your system firefox
note that your system firefox now won't open, it would need the
-no-remote argument to do that
