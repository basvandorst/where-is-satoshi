So is there no need for some more trusted dir authorities?
I mean 10 for the whole networks seems a bit tiny.

Yeah I see but I still think that we need to add some more to prevent a
massive interrupt of the network.
If I would be an evil government attacker I wouldn't go for the
thousands of relays or exits but for the very small amount of trusted

grml and all at the same ISP. Just to clarify things: If root S.A.
stops allowing Tor, there will be no exit nodes in Luxembourg. We
asked anyone here in Luxembourg if they would allow Tor exit nodes.
Only root S.A does.

Who do I have to bug to get some of these Tor Brochures?
It seems that Torproject won't respond over Twitter nor via mail.
We plan to install the Tor Browser bundle at multiple libraries here in
Luxembourg. As our country is multilingual we would need at least a
German a French and a English version.
I guess that the "The Benefits of Anonymity Online" and the "Freedom &
Privacy Online" versions of the flyer's would fit best in our case. But
I guess that some of the "Law Enforcement & The Tor Project" version
would be good to have.

Well French is (sadly :P) historically one of our 3 main languages (even
though not everyone speaks it). But the German and English versions
would cover already most of potential Tor users and supporters here.

Well the blog post claims that if you need brochures you should make
contact. That's what I do ;)
Of course I can print some by myself but when someone here already has
them and is happy to distribute them to organizations - then I will
gladly take them.
