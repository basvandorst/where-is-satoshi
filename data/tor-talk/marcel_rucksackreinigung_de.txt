AFAIK Strato refused to extend a contract with the CCC, who
operated a TOR-Exitnode there. they also refused to close a
new contract with the CCC.
(e.G. "?berlassung an anonyme Dritte", "abandonment for anonymous thirds")
but maybe you just have to change your name, after they recognize
the TOR-Exit and the first contract is about to extend ;)

well in general you should be fine with a network-sniffer of your choice (tcpdump or wireshark for example). just define a filter for
dns-requests and watch it ;)

tried it a few minutes ago and it works for me so far. is there another
