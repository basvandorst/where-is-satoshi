@_subject: Terminal Services of Windows XP 
Hello there,
why is it, when having completely disabled Windows XP's terminal
services, that network map / server info will still show for my
Platform: Tor 0.1.2.18 on Windows XP Service Pack 2 [workstation]
{terminal services, single user}
Greetings, Gregor

@_subject: Relay port changed to 443 (from 9001) with Tor 0.1.2.19 / Vidalia 0.0.16 ? 
Hi there,
after having installed the latest version I noticed that "Relay Port"
in "Basic Settings" is now 443, it was 9001 before.
No info about that in the changelogs or docs. I always had port 9001
open in my NAT firewall for incoming traffic, do I have to open 443
now instead?
Should I leave it to 443 anyway? I guess that could conflict with
https websites that I use without Tor.

@_subject: (Windows) does e-mail scanning with AVG Free work for all unsecured mails going through Tor? 
Hi there,
when I have my Tor server active as an exit node, and mail ports are allowed
in exit policies, I often see the notification balloons of my "AVG
Anti-Virus Free Edition" popping up, briefing me about e-mails currently
being scanned and connections to servers I don't know or use, while no mail
software (and most probably no malware) is running on my machine.
I guess these must be POP and SMTP connections exiting my Tor node, that are
catched by AVG's "AutoPOP3" and "AutoSMTP" e-mail scanners. I wonder if this
really works! I wouldn't mind if it did, because I do not experience any
problems when AVG suddenly jumps into action. There certainly is some CPU
usage, but it is negligible, so this could be considered as an extra feature
or "special service" of mine.
Note: AVG can remove infected attachments, and it can modify the subject
noticable when a virus is found. It also can put a certification info at the
end of the mail text, and it will always add a "X-Antivirus:"-Header.
According to the settings, the scanners use port 10110 for POP3, and 10025
for SMTP, but somehow they catch all traffic on standard ports 110 and 25.

Thanks, that is an interesting thought. I don't know exactly about the
rules in my country, but they may be similar. I only could state that
this virus scanning is just an accident - which is true, because I did
not deliberately install or configure AVG for Tor or vice versa. Both
programs are mostly in default configuration and are not in any way
made to interact, so I would not have to expect that behaviour. And
more, this "filtering" affects only a very, very small fraction of all
the traffic. AVG is not even able to automatically scan POP and SMTP
connections that are TLS/SSL secured, only those carelessly unsecured.
The two other choices now are: Switch off AVG's automatic e-mail
scanning... I think I can remember that once or twice in the last
couple of years AVG did catch a virus that was mailed to me and
slipped the provider's spam filter. Or switch off e-mail ports in my
or's exit policies.
But about that article... the topic is: "The Other E-Mail Threat: File
Corruption in Outlook Express"
Do you really think I am using Outlook Express? No, please! I cannot
deny that I'm using Windows, but that's bad enough. ;)
Yours, Gregor

@_subject: Permission denied error, Tor exiting 
Hi there.
Recently I got strange errors with Tor 0.2.1.19 on WinXP SP3. I have
this Tor version since beginning of August, running almost 24/7 on a
workstation, and this error only occured within the last week 3 times.

No, neither. But do have a suspect now, and that is the anti-virus
software which was having a major version change recently. I will
check this and report here, whether it really is the culprit.
