I installed, configured Tor as client & server and it's running ok except  of the following warning that appears frequently in log:
"Jan 12 09:27:35.640 [Warning] Your server (41.234.216.92:9001) has not  managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable. Please check your  firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc."
OS: Windos XP Professional
Any clues on how to manage that are highly appreciated?

Thanks for advise,
I opened port 9001 at 127.0.0.1 through windows firewall but still  receiving the same warning in tor log?

Thanks for help and advise from all but it didn't work at all through  windows firewall alone.
I need to assign static ip and open required ports through my router for  ORPort of server to be reachable from the outside.
The portforward.com site provide excellent information on all what's  required and guides on how to open ports for different router brands

Is there a way for hiding the IP of host and ISP name from Tor network and TorStatus for security reasons?

Thanks for replies and illuminating.  My question was connected with relay
information and it certainly needed to be better formulated.
Thanks all

I'm running TOR server behind NAT on Windows XP.  In addition to port forwarding, I needed to open ports (22, 9001) on my router's Virtual Server for TOR server to run and be reachable from outside
