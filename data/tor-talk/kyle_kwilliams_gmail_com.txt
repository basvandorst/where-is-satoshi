Ben, you got the right idea.  I use JanusVM with Ubuntu and Backtrack.
In the first version of JanusVM, we only had the bridged network interface.
With the latest release, we have two network interfaces (bridged and
NAT'd).  We changed it for security purposes.
I changed my Ubuntu network connection in VMWare Server from BRIDGED to NAT.
Now with JanusVM and Ubuntu (or Backtrack), I'm using VMWare's NAT'd virtual
NIC to connect from Ubuntu to JanusVM.  In Ubuntu, I just filter out all
network traffic that not going to or from my NAT'd interface netmask.  So if
my LAN is on 192.168.1.X and my NAT'd interface is on 192.168.242.X, then I
just filter out everything that is not from 192.168.242.X.  This keeps me
safe from the following types of attacks, which I haven't talked about or
released until now.  I AM NOT CALLING THIS AN EXPLOIT, it is just a very
simple query (nslookup) that can be used as an attack.
Here's your answer Roger:
*** DISCLAIMER ***
The following is just a very, very simple yet effective means to acquire
your REAL EXTERNAL IP address from WITHIN your internal LAN.  This does not
work on every router/DNS server out there, but it works on the two
ActionTec's and one D-Link retail routers I tested.
DEMO URL:   (yes, I know I just revealed my IP address to the everyone reading this, but
honestly I don't care because [1] I'm making a point and [2] it has already
been rolled to a new IP by the time you read this.)
We (coderman and I) have addressed and solved the issues of side-channel
attacks to reveal your true IP to a server on the Internet.  Now we started
thinking about things that can reveal our true IP INSIDE our LAN.  (HINT:
UPNP would be another place to poke around at to get a real external IP, for
all you Java fans.)  When using VMWare's NAT'd interfaces in the setup I
just described above, you effectively stop this type of attack from working.

I've tested JanusVM with QEMU; still having a few issues there with the
routing and windows causing a nasty loopback effect on traffic.  Hopefully I
will have this resolved soon, because I would really like to get this
running live in windows off a CD and I think (Qemu + Windows Accelerator)
would have a much better foot print in size and speed compared to VMware or
Moka5 does VMWare for USB devices (or "LIVE PC's").  The problem I found
with Moka5 was it didn't like running off a CD, and really was designed to
be run off a USB devices.  Also, it had the same effect as the TAP-Win32
Adapter in terms of installing and un-installing.  You could install it
once, but after you un-installed it, you had to reboot.
Qemu has a few problems being run from a CD, and similar to VMware, you
still have to install the TAP-Win32 Adapter to get the networking to work
from the VM correctly.  Also, after you un-install the TAP Adapter, you have
to reboot windows before you can re-install it again.
I did get a version ( Moka5/VMware and Qemu) of this working off of a CD,
but it had to copy files to the hard drive in a temp directory before use,
then use sdelete to securely (7 passes) erase the files from the hard drive
after the emulator exited.
Personally, I didn't like having to copy files (other than the TAP-Win32
Adapter files) from the CD to the HD, so I never released it...even though
I'm still sitting on the raw images from the last few months.
I like both Qemu and VMware and plan on supporting them both at some point.
As for the licensing, I think Qemu fits the bill, or pretty close anyway.

But if you want to know that the screen size is 1024x768, sure, you just got
the screen size of my VM.  That doesn't tell you that my real screen size is
1280x1024, 1600x1200, or whatever.  As for my OS, I don't care that you find
out I'm running Windows, in a VM.
Then what possible REAL information would you be able to find?
Seriously, someone...anyone, show me how much information you could get
using Java, Javascript, or Flash against JanusVM; I don't think you would
get much USEFUL information.
* What information can you find out that is REAL AND TRUE about the user
and/or environment they are using?
* How would you use this information to track the user to their point of
origin or source?
* How can this information compromise the safety / privacy of the user?
* Can any of the recovered information be used to calculate the users
personality or browsing habits? (such as tracking pedophiles, like HD Moore
wants to do.)
I would be using JanusVM for the transparent proxy layer, Windows XP Pro for
the OS, and both IE and Firefox for the test.  Two VM will be running with
VMWare Server, JanusVM and Windows XP.
If anyone is up for this, just let me know.
Personally, java is nice but I hate coding it and have lots to do already,
otherwise I would do it myself.
I would love to see good results, and have someone make me eat my words.
But as it stands, I think JanusVM is your best bet (for now) to protect
yourself against Java/Javascript/Flash leaking your real IP or other useful

ideas for ya.  ;-)

Simply having the "AUTHENTICATE" command as a means of authentication with
no hashed password or cookie is  bad  idea.
You wouldn't use an empty password for your PC or e-mail would you? (I hope
So don't leave an empty password for the port that controls your Tor
instance, aka, your  anonymity, security, and privacy.
Note that the defaults that come with the Tor-Vidalia bundle and several
others distributions DO NOT set any authentication for the control port, so
you have to manually do it yourself, which could (and probably will) result
in Vidalia or other GUI controls not functioning correctly.  It's a trade
off (for now...) between usability and security, so the choice is yours.
I also want to point out that JanusVM does offer both easy usability and
security, even from insecure defaults and side-channel attacks; However, it
only uses Tor as a client and not as server node, at this time.
The server node option will be present in the next release, so check it out

This makes me happy knowing this probably wasn't some sort of attack on

Exciting. Looks like a bug of some sort.
We make an exception for client-side introduction circuits: the first
three hops ensure your anonymity, and after that we try one random
node at a time out of the set of introduction points listed in the
hidden service descriptor. If one of the intro points doesn't cooperate
(for example because the hidden service is no longer connected to that
introduction point, so they *can't* help), then we move on to the next.
We keep reusing the same circuit (just extending it another hop each time)
so we don't waste a lot of time making new circuits.
But we're *supposed* to be marking each intro point down when it
isn't helpful, so the fact that we're extending back to it (repeatedly
sometimes, based on your jpgs!) is definitely a bug of some sort. Can
you get me a debug-level log from when this happens?
Also, you mentioned that the bug doesn't happen on 0.1.2.8-alpha. What
about 0.1.2.18?

@_subject: another seeming attack on my server's DirPort 
This is just a theory, no hard facts to back it up.
When I'm messing around with Tor's ControlPort, I've noticed that my Tor
traffic just hangs until whatever I'm doing on the ControlPort stops.  There
have been a couple of times where I do something very wrong on the
controlport and Tor just "freezes" (does not route any traffic) until I
close my connection with the ControlPort.   I'm wondering if the same is
true for when someone is fetching descriptors from the DirPort?
Does Tor traffic "freeze" (not route traffic) until the Dirport completes
its task?
Next guess...
If someone where to be attacking, oh say, a hidden service, and your node
was the Introduction Point for that hidden service, then perhaps someone is
trying to force the owner of the hidden service to choose a new introduction
What is the uptime of your node?
Have you typically been running it for a long time?
If someone is DoSing your Dirport, why not just turn it off?
BTW, the SOA for your DIG request, ns.bta.net.cn (202.96.0.133), had a

Hi Kyle,
I'd love to hear more details on this. It would be a bad bug indeed.
But I've never encountered or heard about anything like it, so far. :)
Hi Roger,
Well, you know me, I've got a knack for breaking stuff while in the pursuit
of finding vulnerabilities. ;)
When the following command is used with Tor's ControlPort, Tor will
temporarily freeze until NetBIOS either resolves the request or times out.
This issue is specific to Windows, Linux and Mac are not affected.
I've included a Flash Video of the issue, so you (or anyone else who's
curious) can SEE what it is I'm talking about.
I played with the Dirport for about an hour the other night, and it didn't
seem to suffer from the same issue.  I'll "focus" on the Dirport more after
the holiday rush is over, probably next year.

NBC has a TV show called "To Catch A Predator".  It's a good show, and it
demonstrates about the only real way to protect our children other than

camera, the person behind the camera, the person looking at the picture, or
the network that allowed the picture to be transfered (ie. Tor)?

much choice.  Neither does Tor.  It makes a victim out of them both.

Seriously, don't blame Tor for something that already happened.  It just

pain when I posted that on accident.  But what really set me off was when
gmail started forwarding perfectly good e-mails (which included an e-mail
from this group...obviously) to my spam box, and I blew a fuse.  All I
wanted was to find some god damn spammer and kick the shit out of him or
fuck up the server/box it was coming from.
But since I was on drugs (and still am for the most part), you can disregard
my previous (and possibly current) statement....and no, I don't have that
much bandwidth, I'm not attacking any one's servers, etc, etc...
Glad someone got a good laugh from it though...you're welcome. ;)
I'm just glad I didn't type in a password in the wrong window and press
Send, that would have been really fucked....or fucking funny for everyone
Anyhow, next time I'm on a fist full of pain killers, I'll think I'm going
to stay off the keyboard.
Again, my apologies.

NNTP (News) traffic is not the same as HTTP (Web) traffic.
Privoxy only handles web traffic.
Just because Privoxy doesn't handle NNTP traffic, doesn't mean you can't use
Thunderbird or some other news readers with Tor.  Again, JanusVM will make
it possible for you to use any TCP based application with Tor.

@_subject: Security concerns/help me understand tor 
I mentioned this before to you (Roger) in IRC, but now might be a good time
to bring this up again.
If anyone is concerned about this, and you should be add the following to
your torrc.
ExitPolicy reject :*
Obviously replacing  with your real IP address...not your
internal (LAN) IP address.
I've been scanning the Tor network for a couple of months now looking at
The results have been interesting.  Some have port 80 open on there external
IP's already.  Some don't.  I've focused on those that don't have port 80
open on there external IP, but may have it open to there internal LAN.
There is a quick way to test this.  If your routers web interface is on
192.168.1.1 (or whatever it may be), then try it with your routers EXTERNAL
IP.  If you find yourself looking at the same web interface as you would see
at 192.168.1.1, then you will have a problem.  The reason this happens is
because your router, even though you specify it's external IP, still thinks
it is OK for you to view the web interface because you are coming from the
LAN, not the WAN (ie. Internet).  Even if you have disabled remote
administrator on your router, you're still exposed because Tor is coming
from inside your network, not the outside.
So if someone were to exit from Tor on your PC, going to your external IP
address, they could see your admin web interface to your router which
normally they wouldn't have access to from the Internet.
Here is a real example (sorry to the owner, hope you're reading this).
is open.
is closed.
So I am telling that exit node to go to it's own external IP, and poof, you
have the admin web interface to that persons router (which is usually a
login page).
So if anyone has a web interface to their router and is running Tor, you
would be well advised to add that ExitPolicy rule to your torrc and make
sure you changed the default admin/password on your router.
I don't want to post all the results of my research, for fear that truly
evil Torrorist would go crazy with this.  Let's just say that this could be
very, very bad.  Trust me, Roger, this isn't something that should be taken
lightly.  The moment Tor knows it's own external IP, and is operating as an
exit node, it should (in code) automatically disallow connections to it's
own external IP.  Unless someone has a really good reason why you would need
access to your external IP address from inside your LAN.
BTW, I tried the 'responsible discloser' once already in IRC, remember
So I don't feel bad one bit for talking about this with others.
At least I included a temporary solution to the problem.
Best Regards,
Your friendly Torrorist

That would be a hidden service.  Tor already does that.
What we are talking about is secure defaults for exit nodes.
That's a horrible idea.  You do NOT want everyone to be able to anonymously
fuck with your router's admin page.
You don't need to redirect that specific request either.  It needs to be
dropped.  If you want to offer up a website, then use the hidden service
feature of Tor.
Yes, a hidden service will work behind a router (or NAT'd setup).
If you want to run a hidden server, such as a web site over a .onion
address, then that's fine.
If your router is disallowing people to access the admin webpage interface
from the Internet, that's probably a good thing.
But if running a Tor exit node opens up that admin webpage to the rest of
the Tor network, that's not good.  At that point, anyone could anonymously
try and hack your router.  God help you if they do get in, then your really
in trouble.
There is no point in redirecting that type of request, it needs to be
....Maybe replying with a "bad hacker, not root for you!" webpage would be
funny though.

abilities and half a brain can figure it out.  And javascript/java/flash

We noted this a while back with JanusVM, but I don't think we documented the
reasoning behind it.
(Cue Roger giving a friendly reminder to get more documentation and source

First we disabled those options for obvious reasons.
Then we enabled them because a couple of users wanted more control.
Then we disabled them again because that level of control can be accessed
from the console if they really want it.

Neat site.
Not to rain on the parade, but I'm concerned about side-channel attacks with
this site.
Let me clarify a bit.
It's nice knowing that this site is using HTTPS.  Good.
But when a URL is visited that requires a third party application to watch
it (specifically multimedia content) such as Windows Media or Real Player,
then the users anonymity could be compromised.
I entered the following URL as an example:
(The result in this example shows your true IP address in RealPlayer. I have
no idea what this video is about, I just used google to find one for this
This uses the web browser in RealPlayer (which is just IE hooked in with a
skin around it) and doesn't use the proxy settings from Firefox.
There are a few different applications which make their own connection to
the Internet without using a proxy.
So my question is, could you give users the option to only visit safe
content (.html .htm .jpg .gif .css)?
Could you put up a warning page when they do visit link to a non-html
related page to inform the user that this *might* be dangerous to their
I think this would be a step in the right direction in terms of security of
the users anonymity.  Lots of users who want anonymity do not fully
understand how all the applications on their system work, which could result
in a user following a link to a bad file that could compromise their real IP
address through an application that isn't there browser.
Don't forget about evil Tor exits too, someone could inject traffic into
what would normally be a safe page. ;)

@_subject: Filtering traffic from your node - for exit points 
I spoke with several attorneys and a couple of FBI agents at DefCon this
year about this.  I'll try and summerize what I was told.  Keep in mind,
this is in the US.  It may vary in your country or state.
As a Tor node operator, you are providing a free "service".  As a "service"
provider, you are entitled to monitor your traffic for suspicious activity,
bandwidth usage, and/or attacks against you or your "customers" (Tor
users).  Basically you get some of the rights, if not all, that an ISP does
since you are providing a free internet "service".  Just because it's free
to everyone else doesn't make it less of a internet service; in fact, if you
are paying for your connection to your ISP (which everyone is) then upi have
a "invested interest".  Most people want to, and have the right to know what
is going on with their investments.
"Monitoring" traffic that comes in or out of your connection can consist of
many things.
If you are a "monitoring" bandwidth usage, packets are still being looked
at, but only the size and total number of packets in a given period is what
is being "monitored".
There is Intrusion Detection Systems, or IDS, that does packet inspection to
"monitor" if there is malicious content in the packet/s.  In this case, the
entire packet is being looked over by a piece of software for anything it
might consider malicious.
I put it this way to the FBI agents I spoke with (who were really cool
btw).  I told them that I operated a Tor exit node and I used iptraf and
driftnet to monitor what my connection was being used for.  (They just
grinned when I said this.)  I asked them if this was wrong or illegal of me
to do.  They said no, and that I have rights (mentioned above) as a
"service" provider to protect my "invested" interest.
Because there was so much porn, nasty porn at that, I decided to shutdown my
exit node.  I for one welcome the idea of filtering out porn on my exit
node.  I'm paying for my connection, not Tor users, so as far as I am
concerned, I have the right to say what goes into and out of my node.  IF
you disagree, then take a look at your torrc file, and if you are blocking
ANY port and not allowing ALL traffic to leave your node, then you too are
filtering traffic.
So really, what's the difference between blocking websites and blocking
Nothing, they both are considered filtering.

We have proud to announce a new JanusVM has been released!  The amount of
feedback and response from users has been great!
JanusVM is in the October 2007 edition of PC World magazine!  We had no idea
that Erik Larkin of PC World was going to write an article about JanusVM
until new users notified us that they heard about JanusVM in the magazine.
Thank you Erik!
Here's the link to the article titled "Evade Snoops by Cloaking Your
Internet Activity in Anonymity":
- Below is a list of updates in this months release.
- Upgraded to kernel 2.6.22.3 tick-less scheduling
- Upgraded privoxy to v3.0.6 and latest rules
- Upgraded Tor to v0.2.0.6-alpha now using DNSPort
- Added support for direct transparent routing through NAT device
- Added openvpn client support (see ovpn/ dir in zip)
- Added private directory retrieval
- Blocked NetBIOS traffic from going over Tor.
*It is highly recommended that everyone update for several reasons.
Enhancements in this release make Tor noticeably faster.  It isn't quite the
same as your broadband connection at home, but it's getting better.  There
was also a very important security update in Tor, but JanusVM users need not
worry about it since Tor's control port is bound to localhost inside the VM
and therefore is protected from potentially harmful exploits in either the
end-users applications or Tor itself.  Even the very first JanusVM that was
published over a year ago is still protecting Tor from being vulnerable to
this bug. Hence the power of virtualization.
We included the "tick-less" scheduling in the Linux kernel, which has
increased the speed of JanusVM by roughly a factor of Two on most systems.
As many of you know JanusVM was the first, and still is the only transparent
proxy for Tor in a VM.  We use a VPN from the host OS to JanusVM in order to
make this happen, but now there is a new option.  You can use JanusVM as
your router!  All that is requires is for you to change your IP address
manually, and this will ensure absolutely that no exploit or zero-day attack
against your web browser, e-mail, or IM client will compromise your true IP
address.  Here's an example of the settings that would be used on you
machine to route all traffic through JanusVM.

I get asked at least twice a week what the difference between JanusVM and
JanusVM Live, so let me explain it again for those of you who don't know.
JanusVM Live loads the entire image into RAM (requires 180MB free).
JanusVM Live does NOT save any changes that are made while you use it.
So if you create a new VPN user and reboot JanusVM Live, your user account
will be gone and you will have to recreate it.
The same goes for any log files that are created during usage.  Basically,
JanusVM Live is for users that want to be %100 sure that all their actions
are not logged when they are finished using JanusVM.  Nothing is saved when
you shutdown the LIVE version and everything goes back to a default state
when you use it next time.

@_subject: The pirate bay, torrent and TOR 
I've modified a torrent tracker to work exclusively with .onion addresses.
It will not work with regular IP addresses.
The tracker is bound only to localhost, and sits behind two firewalls to
block it from regular IP addresses.
I've found only one torrent client (Azureus) that allows you to use a .onion
address for a tracker and peers.
I wish uTorrent would behave the same way Azureus does, but it doesn't.
This system is in testing right now.  This is running on a separate Tor
Let me repeat that last part.  This is NOT the normal Tor network.  This is
a SEPARATE Tor network.
This has been worked here and there for about a year now.  Working out the
bugs is time consuming.
So far, it works well with 7 users.
However, scalability issues are going to be inevitable and will probably be
the cause for failure down the road.
If anyone would like to be a alpha/beta tester, e-mail me directly.

@_subject: JanusPA - A hardware Privacy Adapter using Tor 
Hello Everyone,
I've been working on a project for a couple of months now that I'm sure
would be of interest to some of you.  The goal was to apply the same
transparent model coderman and I  used with JanusVM and Tor VM into
hardware.  I wanted something small that you could connect, power on, and
use.  Literally plug-n-privacy.  After several weeks of searching the web
looking at different hardware configuration, specs, etc, etc, I decided to
go with Gumstix(.com).
The privacy adapter is a ARM 400MHz Xscale CPU with 64MB RAM ( 16MB
of Flash memory for storage, and *TWO* 10/100 NICs.  It uses Linux for the
The first thought that many people get, including myself, have is that it is
not powerful enough to run Tor.  Well, after 2 months of breaking this in,
I'm very happy with the results.
I ran this as a Tor server for about 4 days, and got a good baseline for how
much data it can handle.  As a Tor server, it was pushing about 250KB/sec
(125KB in, 125 KB out).
As a Tor client, the best speed test I got was about 1.2MB/sec.  BTW, that
was after about 45 minutes of "SIGNAL NEWNYM" and speedtest before I found a
fast circuit.
Here's the URL for what I've got so far.
It is lacking all forms of documentation, and the source code needs to be
cleaned up some.
It does have a general description, the index of the soon to come
documentation, openssl speed test benchmarks, pictures, and stats of when I
tested it as a Tor server.
After about two months of using it, I've never felt more secure and
satisfied when using Tor.  This is a hardware router that routes your
traffic through the Tor network, it's small, and is easy to use.  As for
security, all TCP and DNS are routed through Tor, and everything else is
dropped.  So all the nasty side-channel attacks that us hackers have been
working on to leak your real IP address are rendered useless.
But there is good news and bad news.
The bad news:
The manufacture (Gumstix.com) is "Phasing Out" this particular setup at the
end of DECEMBER 2008!!  That's in 10 days!  Any orders after Dec. 31, 2008
will have to be in bulk orders, which is 120 or more units.  Shitty.
 Because of the short amount of time left to get this hardware, I've jumped
the gun and chosen to notify the Tor community about this hardware before it
is gone or out of a practical price range for most of us.
The good news:
I've been in communication with a very nice gentleman at gumstix who
said "Gumstix
is also working on a netDUO expansion board for Overo, although a release
date has not been announced."  There is reasonable hope that there new
motherboad product line (the Overo) will at some point have a dual NIC
expansion board.
So this is somewhat a conflicting situation.  I've spent months working on
this awesome anonymity adpater, and it's about to be discontinued without
knowing an exact date as to when the new line with have the capabilities to
do what needs to be done.  ugh.  I'm very much looking forward to their new
product line when a dual NIC expansion board is available, but I don't know
when that'll be.  If anyone is interested in this, but cannot afford to buy
hardware at the moment, please contact Don Anderson (don at gumstix.com)and
encourage the idea of extending their phase out date or express and interest
in a dual NIC expansion board for their new Overo product line.
If anyone is interested in getting a hardware based Tor solution, you might
want to consider buying a gumstix soon.
You'll need the following.
Connex 400mx Motherboard:
netDUO-mmc/SD expansion board:
4.0v Power Adapter:
Screws and spacer kit:
This will run you $237.00 USD + shipping and handling.
I would also *HIGHLY* recommend the following because flashing the device
over the network is very, very risky and has resulted in me having to
re-flash it through the serial port many, many times.
Serial null-modem cable:
Serial port connector:
This will run you $32.00 USD.
If anyone is seriously thinking about a good hardware based solution for
Tor, I'd buy the gumstix now.  In fact, I just bought a couple more just in
case mine breaks. I'll have the source code up withing a week, two tops  The
FULL documentation will take about a bit longer to get done.
Well, that's about it.  Feedback is welcome.
Best Regards,
PS.  Happy Holidays!

 Tor was even cross-compiled for ARM architecture.  I ran it for a few days.
 No problems here.
Comcast would catch any invalid DNS request and re-direct the request to

@_subject: another unusual connection 
I do have a question for "John Smith"; are you using a VPN from your home to your server or from your server to somewhere else?
In the past I've seen this happen with my exit node when I would VPN into my server or a clients server. The VPN connection would set the default gateway and all my traffic would exit the other end of the VPN.   So when Tor would do it's IP check and reachability test, it went bad.
Also, it wasn't obvious right away when this would happen.  Sometimes it would take up to an hour after I had connected the VPN before Tor would freak out.
Since I've seen error messages like yours when I had that problem, I thought I might offer a couple of pointers.
You may want to use the following two options in your torrc config.
Address - This should be the IP of your server which is reachable from the internet.
OutboundBindAddress - If your Tor server is behind a NATd router, then set this to the internal (192.168.x.x or whatever) address of your machine.  This should prevent traffic from leaving a 10.x.x.x address if your real internal address is a 192.168.x.x.
[OPTIONAL THIRD OPTION] AssumeReachable 1 - Prevents your server from doing reachability test.  It will just upload your descriptor to the DAs.
By using the OutboundBindAddress, I was able to have my Tor server listen on my regular local address (192.168.X.X) and not think it was on a the VPN local address (10.x.x.x).  Also, double check to make sure your VPN connection is *not* setting itself as the default gateway (Windows) or pushing the default route (Linux).
(It should be obvious, but just in case it's not, the 192.168.x.x and 10.x.x.x addresses are just examples.  Your setting may be different so adjust your settings accordingly).

Being one of the JanusVM developers, I can answer these questions for you.
On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 2:38 AM, MadAtTorHackers No.  Are you spreading fear without cause.
Yes.  Yes I am, because giving away free software doesn't pay the bills, and users
maybe donate $50 (USD) a month, which is not enough to live on.
Absolutely not!
Re-read that URL please.  I said it has been removed because of the Debian
OpenSSL vulnerability.
Please try to refrain from taking the situation out of context.
Yes, I haven't update JanusVM to use the newest version of Tor, yet.  Soon
No, it has not been dead since 2007.  It's been down for a couple of weeks,
Oct. 19, 2007 was the last time we updated JanusVM because it's fairly low
maintenance and the security model is solid.
Even the ControlPort vulnerability from last year didn't affect JanusVM, and
we had the ControlPort enabled just like everyone else.
Again, Now I know, this problem has been long solved.  BTW, I was the one who told
the Tor developers how to fix it.
They listened and the problem was solved.
If some evil "hacker" gets your controlport, they could:
- Revealing the clients true IP address (anonymity).
- Mapping hidden services to the clients own computer (security)
- Mapping hidden services to other computers in the clients local network
- Mapping hidden services to other services on the Internet (security)
- Moving the client from the public Tor network to a privately controlled
Tor network (privacy)
(  )
If the test are in a controlled environment on systems that the "hacker"
owns, then there is nothing to worry about and nothing you can do about it.
It's called Research and Development.  Research vulnerabilities, and develop
defenses to those vulnerabilities.
Because the world requires money to live a good life and I don't want to be
like the homeless hacker.
Plus, I spent all of 2007 very poor while I worked on R&D.  I'm sick of
being poor and now working my ass off at two jobs.
Yes.  Before you loose sleep over the issue, just disable Tor's ControlPort
and you can worry a lot less.
Or use Firefox + TorButton 1.2.0 is you so choose.
And I have many answers!
Thank you for your concern, but don't worry about it too much.

"Should I snoop on the plaintext that exits through my Tor
*No.* You may be technically capable of modifying the Tor source code or
installing additional software to monitor or log plaintext that exits your
node. However, Tor relay operators in the U.S. can create legal and possibly
even criminal liability for themselves under state or federal wiretap laws
if they affirmatively monitor, log, or disclose Tor users' communications,
while non-U.S. operators may be subject to similar laws. Do not examine the
contents of anyone's communications without first talking to a lawyer.
I just read that again, and I feel I must say a few words about this.
First off, the facts.  Anyone who willing and knowingly sends their traffic
to some random routers on the Internet (encrypted traffic or not) just
waived their right to privacy. It is assumed that their traffic is protected
by encryption, which brings back their privacy, but even that (Debian SSL
bug) can come into question.  However, (s)he who uses Tor is still
*INTENTIONALLY* sending what would be private to you and/or your ISP out to
second and third parties.  To expect privacy when you are doing this is
retarded, unless everything you do is using SSL (again, not Debian's
derivative of SSL).  The best you are going to get is anonymity, but you
gain anonymity by throwing away your privacy (in most cases, not all
Second, I as a 'service provider', whether free to the public or not, do
have the right to monitor what my service is being (ab)used for.  By sharing
my bandwidth, which I pay for (NOT YOU), I have the right to say what is
allowed and what is blocked.  As a Tor exit node, I get to choose which
services (by port) I want to support.  As a service provider (in the USA), I
have the right to watch *EVERYTHING* that goes through my service.  AT&T has
done this, Comcast is hiring right now for people to do this, and the list
goes on and on.  Where AT&T should be getting in trouble is they gave the
information to second and third parties, but I'm not going into that here.
The point is, as a service provider, you have the right to monitor your
services to make sure that they are not being abused or used for anything
which might be illegal.
As for monitoring and logging my traffic, I have that right.  Now if I
distribute those logs to other parties, then I should be in trouble.
Here is a very real example that has happened in Germany.
If someone used my node to make a bomb threat to local police, and the
police come to my house to take my computers, a couple of things could
happen.  But this is one possible take.
If I told them "Wait a minute, I run this great anonymity software called
Tor to help support people in oppressed countries, but I also logged
everything just incase something like this happened.  Since I like you guys
(the cops) so much, I'll give you guys full copies of my logs that I have
been keeping record of since I started my node.  You do have a search
warrent, right?"  I'm willing to bet that the (stupid) cops would be elated
by your cooperation, not threatening to throw you in jail.  As it seems to
be with all the data retention laws going into affect around the world, they
would be very happy to have such a detailed level of co-operation.
So to tell people that it "can create legal and possibly even criminal
liability for themselves under state or federal wiretap laws if they
affirmatively monitor, log, or disclose Tor users' communications" is a load
of crap, in my opinion.  The disclosure part is the only place I see that
would be crossing the line that would probably get you in trouble.
After last years PoC at DefCon and talking with the EFF and FBI about it, I
have a much different take on this.  The EFF attorney's were thinking worst
case scenario, but the FBI agents laughed and basically said "be careful".
I'm not in jail, nor was I ever arrested.  But at the same time, I didn't
exposed people/groups/agencies/etc either.
However the following weekend my house was broken into and someone obviously
was looking for something I no longer had, but that's another story for
another time.  (If that person(s) ever reads this, thanks for not breaking
all my stuff and leaving everything in more or less the way you found it,

If Tor operators were protected by law, I would run a dozen Tor nodes. However, that is not the case in this day and age.
Oh, I encourage people all the time to use Tor, but along with that I encourage them to be secure and use the best Tor implementation possible.  I don't want my friends and family being affected by some new Perhaps it is time for people to step back and realize what I've said for awhile now. Fighting vulnerabilities in Layer 7 of the OSI model will always be a reactive situation to new 0-days. We you are in a reactive situation to a 0-day, you've already lost and must scramble to get a patch out.  By adapting Tor in layer 3 or layer 1 of the OSI model, or by putting into a completely separate OSI environment (VM), we can reduce the surface area of attacks on our anonymity from 0-days My old boss taught me a valuable lesson: Work smarter, not harder.
And for the record, I do fight for anonymity online by providing the most secure and 0-day resistant Tor implementation out there.  Likewise, I've contributed my fair share of security bugs to Mike Perry, Roger, and Nick in a responsible manner.
So to say that I "personally don't want to fight for online anonymity", is fucking bullshit.
I'm starting to feel like the anti-hero of Tor.  I change my views from full disclosure to responsible disclosure.  I've helped in projects of others.  I've given Roger my honest opinion when he asks for it.  I've given away free software that is way more secure than all the other implementations out there.

It also depends on what you are using Tor for.
If you are checking your e-mail (or whatever) that is associated with your
real identity, then use only HTTPS.
But if you are checking a different e-mail account that you have (1) setup
over Tor and (2) only use for anonymous purposes, then you run a very small
risk of being associated with the activity of that account.
Remember, just because your traffic is anonymous doesn't mean it's private.
So if you say "This is John Smith and my SSN is xxx-xx-xxxx" or whatever
over an anonymous connection to a blog or forum, then you are asking for

@_subject: Applications Recommended For Use With Tor +++ PROPOSAL, DRAFT +++ 
Hello Alex,
I have been working on the security in regards to Tor for a couple of years
now, and I'm very pleased to hear that someone else is taking interest in
putting together a list of acceptable applications.  I have to agree that
the biggest threat to one's anonymity is going to be a bug/vulnerability in
a layer 7 application that gets leveraged into tricking the application to
no longer using the proxy, or using some other type of side-channel
feature/application which wasn't designed with Tor in mind.
I've already logged into the Wiki and updated the Test Procedures section.
Seeing as I've found lots of IP disclosure vulnerabilities in the past (and
future?), I for one would be more than happy to help with this.
One application that should never show up on this list is Internet
Explorer.  I've got two 0-days right now for IE, and they would totally
compromise your anonymity and security.  Don't worry, they've been reported
through 3Com's ZDI program and I'm waiting to see the fixes come out (who
knows when).
If you use Tor, DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER!
Let the bug hunting continue!!  w00t!

Tor VM is a small virtual machine that acts as a router and redirects your
TCP traffic and DNS request through Tor while filtering out protocols that
could jeopardize your anonymity. Tor VM is built using all open source
software and is free.
 There are many advantages to running Tor in a virtual machine. Any
application on any operating system that uses TCP for communication is
routed over Tor. By using a small virtual machine that acts as a router,
protocols such as UDP and ICMP are filtered, preventing a compromise of your
anonymity. Placing Tor in a virtual machine separates Tor from potentially
insecure applications that could compromises Tor's integrity and your
 The Tor VM ISO is designed to be run in a virtual machine, not on physical
hardware. The ISO requires two virtual NICs to be used; one bridged
interface, one OpenVPN Tun/Tap adapter. The Windows build of Tor VM is
portable and includes QEMU to run the virtual machine, but requires
Administrator privileges to install the Tap32 adapter. Traffic is routed
through the Tap interface, into the VM, TCP and DNS are directed to Tor's
Transport while other protocols are discarded, then Tor does it's magic with
your traffic. More details can be found in the design documentation.
 Lots of people are going to ask "What's the difference between JanusVM and
Tor VM?", so I'll address this now. JanusVM was designed to be used by
multiple users, runs HTTP traffic through Squid and Privoxy, and was build
on top of Debian packages. Tor VM is built from entirely 100% open source
software, is pre-configured to support only a single user, is much smaller
in size, uses less memory than JanusVM, and works with QEMU. Is Tor VM going
to replace JanusVM?? It's too soon to tell.
 This software is in the late alpha stages of development; work is still in
progress. For the time being, Tor VM is being hosted on the JanusVM server.
Martin and I would appreciate it if a few of you would give Tor VM a go and
provide us with your feedback. Feel free to review the We look forward to
hearing from the community.
 One last thing. Mad props to coderman! Martin did an amazing job hacking
QEMU and the WinPCAP drivers in order to create an interface that is a raw
bridge into the existing network card. This is just as good as VMware bridge
service, if not better! It's Amazing work; make sure to take a close look at
what is under the hood. Tor VM wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for

Hello Chris,
My response is inline with the message thread.
Yup, this is what you want to use.
Incognito has a couple of good additional rules which might be of use.
Based on the best transparent Tor solution, this is a must read! ;)
I've been working on a 400MHz StrongARM XScale PXA255 CPU, 16MB of Flash
storage, and 64MB of RAM, and 2 x 100Mbps Ethernet ports.
With better memory management with the newer 2.x alpha versions of Tor, this
seems very realistic now.
Right now TorVM can run as a client on as little as 16MB of RAM, so I think
64MB will cover it.
I believe coderman has been using the TorVM as a server, so he would have a
better answer as to how much RAM it uses running as a server node.
The benchmarks[1] for crypto on this are as follows (sorry if the spacing is

Running a server would be possible, but it would be much slower than if you
ran it on your P4.
In it's current state, it take about 60 seconds to boot.
So far, it has been very good with the memory usage compared to older
version which consumed hundreds of MB.
There are a few things that you may want to take into consideration:
- How would you configure the device in different environments? (Work vs
Home vs On the road).
- How do you handle being behind a proxy?
- What if the router on the LAN is using MAC filtering?
- What if you want to run a hidden service?
- How do you update it?
I've been focused on this for awhile now, and have solutions to most of the
questions people find themselves asking about this type of implementation.
The goal has been to get the same level of transparency that you see in
JanusVM or TorVM into hardware.

Hi all,
I've been playing around with Google's new web browser and Tor.  I thought
it might be good to share my findings with everyone.
After reading Google's privacy policy[1], I for one would not want to use
this on a regular basis, if at all.
The first bug I tried was an old one I found with Firefox; the NEWS:// URI
Any link that has a NEWS:// URI will launch Outlook Express and attempt to
contact the server in the URL...without using Tor.
The second bug I found resulted in local file/folder disclosure.
This is very similar to the one I found in Internet Explorer.
The third bug I found was with MIME-TYPEs, specifically Windows Media Player
supported formats.
The BANNER tag can also leak your IP address when the playlist is loaded
*IF* WMP is not set to use a proxy.
Also, a playlist in WMP can specify protocols that use UDP, hence, no proxy
support...no Tor.
On the flip-side, it is very cool how each browser tab is it's own process,
making several types of attacks much more difficult.
However, with an invasive privacy policy, local proxy bypassing, and local
files/folders able to be read from your hard drive, I've decided not to use
this browser.
It just doesn't feel privacy/anonymity friendly to me.
Anyone else want to chime in on this?

So I find it funny that you write this as I am compiling a micro X11 VM for
the exact application you describe, for many of the same reason you mention.
I've been playing with this idea for quiet some time now, about a year.
I have a rough working prototype of what I would like to see, but it's about
420MB in size, based on gentoo, and to me that is way to large.
I've looked into Xbuntu and lots of others, and the solution I'm trying is
to use the Kamakazie OpenWRT build for generic x86 running just X and a web
browser application.
So trying to get Mozilla, aka Firefox, integrated into the kamakazie build
system is a nightmare.  I tried, coderman tried, and we're not going to try
anymore with it.  Mozilla code wasn't designed for this type of thing.
Three days ago coderman and I thought that chrome might be a good option.
 He downloaded the linux version, compiled and said it looked pretty
straight forward and would probably work.
So now I'm recompiling the Micro X11 VM with a kernel update, then I'll try
and add chrome into the Mix.  If all goes well, we should have something in
a few weeks.
Just so you know, I thought this was going to be much easier than it has
turned out to be....their are all kinds of incompatibility issues, bugs, and
customizations that always come up.
It has taken a very long time since initial idea to get this far and keep it
this small.  Right now the X11 VM is coming in around 11MB, that's with Tor,
kernel, X11, and the minimums needs to run.
I'm not sure how big Chrome is, but we'll see.
It'll be based on a similar build system as Tor VM.  The idea is to keep it
small in size, low in memory usage, and integrated like it's any other
application on the system, even though it's running in a VM.  The VM engine
we used in Tor VM is Qemu.  My personal goal is to try and get everything at
or below 50MB in size, but we'll see how that turns out.
If you haven't looked at Tor VM, you might want to do so.  It's a good base
to start a project like what you describe, and is what we've been working on
(quietly) for some time now. :)

If done correctly, no.  To start, don't run the browser as root, make a
less privileged user user and run it as that user.  This would prevent them
from being able to modify iptables rules and read files created by other
program (such as Vidalia's temp storage of the controlport password), which
are needed.  Iptables rules can include/exclude certain users from accessing
certain ports.  So don't let anyone other than the 'vidalia' user (again,
less permissions required, root is not needed) which could run vidalia
connect to Tor's ControlPort.  Protecting the control port from
users/programs who should not have access is very, very important.  Much
worse things than just setting the entry node could be done if an attacker
got full access to the control port, but we won't go there.
A browser should not have access to Tor's ControlPort, but Vidalia probably
should.  Most applications that use Tor do not need to control Tor, and
separating the two is a very important security requirement with a project
such as this.
This application has nothing to do with entropy; it's purpose is to
secure/separate/isolate the browser (or whatever app) from the rest of your
host OS by placing it inside a very small VM.  So in the event you do get
owned (through your application/plugin that is using Tor), it's running
under a user account that has limited permissions in an isolated
environment, thereby reducing the level of damage that can be caused.  Since
most of this VM, if not all of it, will be running from an ISO image
(read-only), then the amount of damage that can be caused is very, very
minimal, if any at all.

This is a tricky question which depends on your requirements.  Before I get
into which is better than which VM engine, I first must understand what it
is I want to do with my browser.
Do I want to be able to download data and save it, or just be able to
observe it?
If you want to save data, where/how do I store it in such a way that I can
securely access it from other mini VMs without compromising that
VMs integrity?
Older vulnerabilities exist for both VMware and Qemu that allowed access to
the host OS through the guest OS because the VM engine itself was "folder
sharing" from the host to the guest OS.
These have been patched for quite some time, but such a feature that allows
"guest to host" sharing makes me nervous, and I think should be avoided *at
the VM engine level* at all cost.
The downside is, I'm not sure how to save my downloads from the VM to
another VM or the host OS itself without opening up a whole for an attacker
to get through assuming a root compromise inside the VM.
I'm a fan of having a base ISO and storing any changes made in memory.  If I
do get infected by some 0day, the only information they could pull would be
any existing cookies, cache, or history I may have from my browser
(depending on my browser's settings).  Not to mention, since it's a read
only ISO, no permanent changes can be made.
VMware fails right there.  The installer is 175+ MB compressed, and the
software is not portable (literally or legally).
I've been a fan of Qemu the last few years.  It's open, portable, small foot
print and low on memory usage.
With Qemu, I was able to create a Linux OS in ISO format that contained a
Win32 version of Qemu , Autorun.ini, and a win32 batch script that would
launch Qemu (in Windows) using the CD-ROM drive as the Boot device, and it
worked great.  This enabled both a both bootable CD and a Windows supported
VM all from the CD-ROM.  You wouldn't be able to do that with VMware based
on the size of the engine and it's dependencies, it would take up almost the
whole CD.
Take a look at Moka5(.com).  This is pretty much what we were aiming to do
at one point.
Moka5 is however based on (funded by) VMware , and vmware totally jacked
this idea from two guys after sending them a siest and desist letter
Back to the hypervisor; this would be really nice.  I have see some problems
If I have a browser VM (B-VM), and a email VM (E-VM), how does the B-VM
communicate with E-VM through things like the "e-mail:" URI type?
Should B-VM and E-VM even be able to know about each other?
Perhaps having a virtual "clipboard" that supports copy and paste functions
between VM's, or does that open another security hole?
(  )
To bring up another point, do all them VMs you want to be anonymous use the
same instance of Tor, perhaps running in it's own VM, or do they use their
own instances of Tor?
Lets say my E-VM is set to check my e-mail every X minutes. Does my E-VM use
the same circuit as my B-VM is current using?
So what happens if an attacker puts the client into a .exit loop, keeping
them stuck on their exit node (is this still a problem..?)?
I think this gets deeper in the sense of how much an application that uses
Tor can control Tor *without access to the control port*.  In this case,
having the .exit notation enabled would probably be bad if two or more
applications / VM's are sharing the same instance of Tor, as one infected VM
could affect the traffic on the other VMs.  There are lots of tricky
security issues that need to be taken into account when working on multiple
VM systems, or worse, VM to host OS solutions.
Well, that's pretty much what I've been thinking about for quite some time
now.  I've spent a ton of time looking into this and discussing it with
It takes soooo much time to do all this, and it can become a bit mind
numbing if you do it for too long.
In my opinion, good security for your anonymity and privacy is a bitch in a
Web 2.0 world. It seems like all of our browsers, media players, IM clients,
and games are now being integrated to communicate with each other.  While
this seems great to the user's experience, it can be very destructive to
one's privacy and anonymity.

You may want to look at the Chromium Browser VM.  It's beta, but
functional and supports Tor.
It's also 3x faster (inside a VM) than Firefox running natively on the
host OS.
WHAT IS Chromium Browser VM?
The Chromium Browser VM is what the name says, the Chromium web browser
 running inside a virtual machine
. The primary difference
from other VMs is that the browser window is being exported back to the
host OS using the X Window System  (or
X11) protocol. By running Chromium inside a VM, we are protected from
unknown malicious exploits, vulnerabilities, and side channel attacks
 that could compromise our security,
privacy, and anonymity. By exporting the browser window back to the host
OS, we get a look and feel as though it's just another application on
our system, even though it's running from inside the VM. This creates a
secure environment in which we can now run Javascript, Flash, and Java
in a browser without having to worry about compromising the host OS if
we get exploited.
Side note, the ISO can also be burned to a CD-ROM and used as a boot CD.
It may or may not be what you're looking for, but I thought I would

@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] Chromium Browser VM Beta 
Hello everyone,
I've been working on a secured browser VM for the last few months, and I
feel it's to a point that it can be shared with the rest of the world.
You can find the project at:
The Chromium Browser VM is just what the name says.  It's the open source
web browser, Chromium, placed inside a VM.  Unlike a normal VM, the browser
attempts to export it's display back to the Host OS via the X11 protocol.
 This makes the browser feel native to the end user while operating from
inside the VM.  Windows users will be using Xming to get X11 protocol
compatibility, which comes with the ChromiumVM.zip file.  Linux and Mac OS X
users should be able to run the VM with little to no problems.  The VM runs
from a ISO image, so you know that the browser is working with a known good
state everytime you use it.
There are still a few bugs that have to be worked out, but most of those
bugs rest in the hands of Google.  Updates to this VM will become available
as new releases of Chromium become available.  The two major problems are
printing and saving files.  I've got a temporary fix for Windows users so

@_subject: TBB on XP again 
Hi Mikel,
By chance have you used any virtual machines on the host OS that runs your
NIS firewall?
There are two networking modes I'd be curious about.  The first being a
'bridged' networking interface.  The second being a 'NAT' networking
interface.  I would think that 'bridged' networking would not be affected by
NIS on your local system, and would be able to operate on the network
without restrictions, since it appears as a completely separate device on
the network.  I'm curious about a NAT'd interface though.  I would think
that is would be affected by NIS, since all traffic would pass through the
host OS before entering the network.
For my day job, I managed a global VM infrastructure.  One of my duties is
to make sure all the VM's stay up-to-date with the latest security patches
for the different OS's .  I've noticed that the securities measures that
allow the company to audit "who is doing what" can be easily bypassed if a
VM is brought online and doesn't have the proper management software
installed.  (However, network audits catch this within 24 hours.)  This can
be good or bad depending which side of the fence you're on.  Perhaps in your
case it might be good to use a VM that has a 'bridged' network interface to
try and avoid NIS?  If you don't have admin level access, then you are
probably stuck using a NAT'd network interface for your VM.
The other advantages of using a VM with a 'bridged' network interface in a
restrictive or monitored environment is:
1) Process auditing will only see that a VM was run (qemu.exe or
vmplayer.exe) in the audit logs.  (So what ran in the VM? Who knows... ;-)
2) Network auditing on the HOST OS will not see a direct connection between
your VM's traffic and the HOST OS.
3) You can keep it with you on a USB flash drive.  Maybe even a Live CD with
a VM on it?
4) Use OS encryption on the VM itself to protect your VM in the event it
becomes remotely audited, copied, or stolen.
Just my two cents worth...
Best regards,
- Kyle

I'm not seeing the benefit of Tor Fox since Tor Browser Bundle[1] and XB
Browser[2] do the same thing your doing.  Why are you trying to recreate
work that's been done already?First off, you didn't even have the browser's
proxy set to use Tor on port 9060, I had to set that myself. I noted that
the Tor Fox homepage is set to use the Tor Fox search engine, which is uses
Google results, and display's google ADs right on the top of the page.  I
was able to get a real IP address from my deanonymizer that I've been
working on. Further more, a few security issues exist with Tor Fox.
- Several URI's can be used to reveal your true IP address.
- All the plugins are still enable (Flash, Adobe Reader, etc..), which can
lead to IP disclosure.
(I stopped my review after I found this out, because one could be really
pwned with all plugins enabled.)
This leads me to think that you're trying to make a quick buck off of Google
ADs while leaving Tor users exposed to security exploits of would-be evil
doers or some hackers that just enjoy making a ruckus. So, if you are
serious about securing Tor Fox then you need to install TorButton.  Mike
Perry and others have worked hard on making TorButton secure from several
different types of attacks and information leakage, hence why it is used and

I think "snooping" and "statistical information" should be treated
differently.  Take Scott's case here.  He is making a claim that by using
the exit policy outlined above, it would reduce the amount of traffic on tor
by 70% or whatever.  What I would like to see proof of is that the IP
addresses that are now being blocked are NOT running a WHOIS services.  How
do we know for sure that they are not in fact a valid WHOIS service?
So, Andrew, would running 'iptraf' on a exit node to see the amount of
bandwidth that is being used or what IP/ports are being connected be
considered "wire tapping"?
I'm not trying to start an argument, I'm just trying to figure out how a
researcher can do his/her work, get real answers, without crossing the line
of "wire tapping".  That's all.

Sorry to hear your having troubles with JanusVM and for the lack of
information for Linux users.
JanusVM is not a zombie/defunct/dead as I use it quite often with different
operating systems, even with my smart phone, and it works just fine.
Let's say JanusVM's settings are:
eth0 (On VMware's bridged interface)
IP: 192.168.1.102
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
eth1 (On VMware's NAT'd or Host-only interface)
IP: 192.168.50.128
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Let's say your PC NIC settings are as follows:
IP: 192.168.1.100
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
DNS: 192.168.1.1
All you have to do is change the Gateway and DNS settings on your PC to:
IP: 192.168.1.100
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.102
DNS: 4.2.2.2
Any other PC on your LAN can do the same using the 192.168.1.102 address as
their gateway and set their DNS to an external DNS server.
OR if you want to isolate your PC from the LAN you could use:
IP:  192.168.50.130
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.50.128
DNS: 4.2.2.2
Notice the gateway address is now pointing at JanusVM, and the DNS address
is using an IP OUTSIDE YOUR LAN.  The reason you need your DNS to point
outside your local LAN is to prevent DNS leaks.  When the DNS server is
outside your LAN, the DNS resolve request get's sent to JanusVM where it is
redirected to Tor's DNS port.
Expect JanusVM to be updated soon because of the recent security bug found
in Tor.
I'm still in holiday mode with family and friends and will update it soon.
 The reason you don't see it updated every month is because we use a little
software as possible to create it, reducing the amount of updates/patches
required to keep it secure.  Generally the only thing that we have to update
is Tor.
Happy Holidays,

Correct.  All users and trackers would have to have a .onion address.
I have both a torrent tracker and client setup to do this.  I wrote a UPNP
client to help setup end-user's as routers for the network too. I even
bought a domain name just for this. It's been tested and works quite well.
So why haven't I released this?  Well, I was asked nicely by one of the Tor
author's NOT to do this due to fears that the Tor network would not be able
to handle the amount of traffic torrent users would bring.  Out of respect,
I did what was asked of me and did not release these to the public.
This is a hot topic, with good arguments on both sides.  However, I feel
that until someone launches such a service, we will not know which way it
would go.  Perhaps we need to branch off a new Tor network that is used more
exclusively for hidden services, in hopes of encouraging people to run a
router (non-exits only) without the risk of getting harassed because of

@_subject: browser fingerprinting - panopticlick 
This was one of the design points of Tor VM; to protect Tor by running
it inside a VM, so if your browser in the HOST OS goes bad on you Tor
would be protected inside the VM.
You may want to take a look at another project I've had out for a few
months, but haven't really made much light of it.
Chromium Browser VM
The name says it all.  It's Chromium running inside a VM.  Unlike
traditional VMs, this VM attempts to make the browser feel like a native
application to the HOST OS even though it's running inside the VM.  If
you open a "Incognito" session with Chromium, it does a pretty good job
at protecting your privacy with regards to your history and cookies,
preventing the disclosure of what sites you've visited on the Internet
(tested against JS & CSS).  Check it out.
You can run it in different modes:
- Exported browser display (default)
- Exported browser display with plugins disabled
- Browser in a local X server (inside the VM's window or as a boot CD.)
- Browser in a local X server with plugins disabled (inside the VM's
window or as a boot CD.)
- All the above options + Tor
The ISO is also bootable from a CD-ROM, just burn it, boot it, and
choose a boot option with "Local X Server".  It uses the same drivers
turnkey linux (aka: Ubuntu 8.04).
So it's over kill for driver support from the VM stand point, but it's
good as bootable CD for lots of different hardware vendors.
Exactly.  That's why the OS for the VM is in ISO format, so it is
treated the same as a read-only CD.  Everytime you reboot or start up
the VM, you know it's running from a known clean state.
Against the EFF's new fingerprinting tool, this browser VM masks most of
your real attributes, but fails when it comes your screen size. Interestingly, the color depth was off and reported 24 when should be
32.  BTW, the performance benchmarks with this browser inside (or
outside) a VM smoke FF and IE hands down.  Kudos to Google. :)

There is no such option in JanusVM.
I want to run some Socks program like FreeCap or something after the

Tor on the IP address of JanusVM.
If your program goes through Tor, then the destination host will only see
the IP of the exit node.

If you connect the VPN to JanusVM, then used FreeCap, all the SOCKS traffic
from FreeCap would pass through Tor.
I installed JanusVPN using the Run.bat command that is provided inside

You might want to look at JanusVM.
I have created a simple Bash script to prevent any data from bypassing Tor
when Tor is running. I started it to use just for myself, but now I think
it will be better to share it with other users of Tor.
This script, named Torlock, does the following things when used to start
- Creates a special user named torlock by default (if you run it first time
 or have removed that user after previous Tor session).
- Uses Iptables to block network access for everyone except for torlock.
- Setuids to torlock and starts Tor. Tor will be started in background mode,
 and its output redirected to a file.
When used to stop Tor, it stops Tor, unlocks network access, and
removes torlock user.
More information is in included text file. Even more can be obtained by
the script. It is small, simple, and easy to make sure it's not
backdoored. The script can be downloaded from Sourceforge:
Inspite of its simplicity, Torlock saved me at least twice when I forgot to
switch Torbutton on.
With best regards,

@_subject: Bitcoin And The Electronic Frontier Foundation 
Coderman sent this to me, and I'm a little upset because the extra
$60.00/month for 0 bitcoins is very annoying.  I have since stopped trying
to generate bitcoins, because it's just wasting electricity.  More comment
inline below debating this point.
For those who are wondering if it's worth trying to generate bitcoins, here
is something to think about.
I've had a single Quad-Core (2.6GHz/core, 12MB L2 cache) server crunching on
bitcoins for about 6 months now.  About 2-3 months ago, it stopped
generating bitcoins.
Someone is out there with a lot of GPU's, crunching away at the bitcoin
network and is hording/generating all the bitcoins.  I say this because the
amount of chatter on the bitcoin forums in regards to GPUs vs CPUs has
exploded, and new GPU clients are being released.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
That's correct, it has to do with the number of operations per second you
CPU/GPU can do.  The network is based on the number of supporters.  Apple's
and oranges.
You're twisting facts together here, again apple's and orange's.
Inflation aside, GPUs will generate bitcoins much, much faster than a CPU.
Opportunists will quickly drive the profit from generating down to
No, the value of bitcoins starts to be cut in half as the more bitcoins are
"The number of blocks times the coin value of a block. The coin value is 50
bc per block for the first 210,000 blocks, 25 bc for the next 210,000
blocks, then 12.5 bc, 6.25 bc and so on." --
So when the value of BTC's starts to be cut in half, and with INFLATION now
at a record high, the cost of electricity is NOT GOING DOWN.
Hence, the chance of you generating bitcoins will go down because a CPU can
not compete with someone else's GPU, more power/electricity is being used to
generate (or not generate) bitcoins, and after the last six month's of
running bitcoin, I haven't generated a single block in over two months
because someone has already cornered this market with GPU's.
They are also the driving force behind a free market.  Or do you think
Of course someone quotes the "free market" when they have a large corner of
it.  Free market's always FAIL when someone is hording all the (bit)coins,
and while it may support free market's, it certainly is not a fair market
today.  If 2,000,000 bitcoins are spread about a few thousand people, and
19,000,000 coins are held by 1 person, your "Free Market" goes down the
drain because one person could out-buy anyone else.
One last point; by looking @ the  channel on IRC, it shows that
about 600 people are wasting their CPU cycles because someone has most
likely has a cluster of GPU's working away at this.  This is the wasted cost
of TRYING to generate a bitcoin.  If only one person can generate the block
(ie, 50 Bitcoins right now), then 599 people are wasting their electricity
and time.  So the ~$60 a month (increase in my electric bill) * 599 =
$35,940.  Even if we decide to be really conservative (not realistic in this
case) and cut this cost down by a tenth, it's still ~$3,594 being wasted per
month while someone else get's the coins.  How "green" or "eco-friendly" is
Now I ask the community, If your chance of generating a bitcoin block for
yourself is slim-to-none,  would you want to waste your time and money
trying to generate bitcoins?
Don't get me wrong, I hate what is happening to the USD, and love the idea
of crypto currency, but I see some serious flaws with bitcoin.
He who has the biggest cluster will win the day, and leaves the rest of us
with next to nothing.

@_subject: Is it possible to firewall Tor traffic with a hardware firewall? 
One possible solution would be to run Tor on the firewall/router instead of
the PC/server, and configure the HiddenServicePort to point to the PC that
is running the service you want hidden.
You would also want to make sure that the firewall/router is routing all
traffic from the hidden service PC to Tor's TransPort, which should also be
configured in your torrc. As long as all incoming and outgoing traffic is
routed through the Tor network, the likely hood of having a successful side
channel attack reveal your real IP is slim.
Two network cards would be required to reduce the possibility of side
channel attacks. One for the PC(s) that you want to have running the hidden
service, and the other one connecting to the Internet.  I've previously
worked on a project for this type of security, and have a few diagrams which
may or may not be the type of setup you're looking for.
Here's an example script you would want to run on the firewall/router
(assuming it's running linux).  Modify for your security requirements
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr
$IPTABLES -F
$IPTABLES -t nat -F
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -o $EXTIF -p tcp -m state --state
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
# REDIRECT DNS REQUEST TO TOR'S DnsPort
$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INTIF -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to
# REDIRECT HTTP REQUEST TO PRIVOXY/SQUID, WHICH THEN USES TOR (OPTIONAL)
$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INTIF -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to
# REDIRECT EVERYTHING ELSE TO TOR'S TransPort
$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INTIF -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to 9095
# DROP EVERYTHING ELSE (ICMP, UDP, ETC...)
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -o $EXTIF -j DROP

I have been having the same issue on my Droid with the 2.2 firmware, which

The downside is everything goes through the vpn, including apps like e-mail
when all you want is a browser using it.

Dude, I told you to quit asking the Tor mailing list these things as I've

In your case, you're new default route should be set to 192.168.0.5 (the IP
for JanusVM).
You're about 1 more question away from being labeled a troll.
This is basic linux/unix routing.  Changing your IP and default route in
linux is not that hard, as I've explained how to do this is a very detailed
e-mail already.
Sorry their isn't a perfect step-by-step for you, but if you don't know how
to change your route, IP address, or DNS in Linux then you have MUCH to
learn before you can effectively stay anonymous.
And for the last time, LEARN BASIC LINUX NETWORKING *BEFORE* you ask

So I guess nobody remembers or knows about my brief 15 minutes at Blackhat
a few years back where I warned about much more than what is being
disclosed here in regards to Ultrasurf or GIFC.
Here's the Audit I did from years ago.
Includes Video's of the audit sessions, IP's and hostnames they scan, pcap
dump, and ZIP files or older version which contain the original
malware/spyware (you've been warned).
So here's the very, very short run down Since I'm pressed for time.  This
is total spyware.  They record all your traffic, and use their "clients" to
further scan the Internet or INTRANETs in some cases.  They scan banks,
colleges, and even US Government systems like the Department of Energy
while using the users to mask the origin or the scans/hacks.  Sneaky shit.
 They completely blew me off when they got accused of this before, but
anyone can watch or audit this crap themselves and see they are up to no
good.  Almost all their old version have a Trojan or spyware or some kind.
If I recall, the US State Department granted them a 1.5 Million USD for
something or another.
Bottom line and simply put, GIFC/Ultrasurf IS VERY BAD AND THE (STUPID) US
GOV IS HELPING PAY FOR THIS SHIT TO EXIST.
