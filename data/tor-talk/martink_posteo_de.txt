how much sense does it make to use your reduced policy
_without_ port 80 just because of laziness on my side and for a starting
point to be an exit relay? it's a really small relay. Does anybody do that?

     How to make a systemwide firefox installation as similar to

sure it is possible. I use one as a bridge but running a normal relay is
even easier. you can just "apt-get install tor" and edit the
advice to leave "reject *:*" as your exit policy if you use it at home.
Don't forget to forward Port 9001 and 9030 to your raspi at your router
(as you probably already do with your ssh port)
It's going to be used which is good itself. Legitimate in anyone's view
or not. When you decide to run a relay, you really shouldn't care I think.

@_subject: [tor-talk] More and more websites block Tor, 
I would love if we were at a point where running an exit from home is
seamless. I really think you're right and only one thing is missing to
get there: a critical mass doing it.
Unfortunately until then we have a chicken and egg problem for those
(like me) who don't want to waste too much time and effort but still
want to run an exit node. I don't like it but the only way is to buy a
seperate internet connection for it. Only that way I really know my exit
node is protected by law.
It doesn't help to get to a critical mass of people running an exit
because most people don't even know what server housing and that stuff
actually is.
Selling Routers with OpenWRT and Tor inside would maybe help.

At least I would not be able to run an exit node if at any level I could
decide on _what_ packets flow throught TCP Port XY. As I said, that's
the legal foundation. Aside from possibly harming user's anonymity, I
don't see any scenario that would not harm my position in front of the law.

You should check a checksum manually either way. Contious web services
post the sha1 of a new certificate (or offer to send it via sms or
whatever) and offer you to check it manually. Although it's signed by
some CA.
Self-signing is not at all less secure, quite often the opposite is true.
I'd *love* a firefox-notification (just like "plugin is missing") that
just reads the sha1 of the certificate in big letters.

So assuming that people here

attack on Users; Given that they are listening *really* well and
knowingly manage to become Guard + Exit of Users in order to deanonymize
1. What would help (and not change any other anonymity-parameters)? When
my guard goes offline, don't "ever" pick it as guard again? servers can
change quickly, so probably not...
2. Would some kind of "web-noise" generation in Torbrowser help? like so
3. Will the content of that talk be publicly available?
4. Tails does not remember guards right? Is that really the safest way
you know (for now)?
5. Everything can be mobile now. Maybe such
location-aware guards should become the default?

I think because in a 2 hop scenario the entry node (that knows its next
hop) knows that that very node (exit) knows the destination (and often
contents) of the packets. Both nodes learn significantly more than in a
3 hop scenario.
And there would be _no_ middle relays, so running a random relay would
provide the administrator with entry information plus the exact server,
where the exit information to any given connection could be found, or
vice versa.
In our 3 hop scenario the middle relay takes care of seperating entry
and exit information.
There may be other reasons.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blacklists 
Use services that don't block Tor. Tell the other operator why you are leaving. Ask admins or poke any adress you find from a website that is important to you, that blocks us, why they are doing so. Tell your friends to use TBB, it's awesome how useable is it nowadays. They should just "click to play" flashplayer and just about anyone can use it. It's the best browser there is. Tor Browsers have to become visible to (still?) friendly website operators.
It's annoying sometimes but overall I know why I'm doing it and I keep doing it. It's tiny steps but the only steps to a situation (maybe) where every private home connection can be an Exit and the Internet doesn't react in any way to it. I'm glad the torproject offers to "discriminate" Tor users, it can be done anyways. I just hope it becomes less and less affordable.

Basically it shouldn't matter at all how weak a connected relay is, no

much bandwith and that's nice of her, but oh well, bandwith authorities
give her how much she can actually offer. So, why does that distance matter?

What do you mean? blocking traffic from the Tor network is very common
and a standard feature that torproject itself supports.
This is just the same in reverse. The list of all relays is publically
available. Pick which ever you want and block or whitelist them.
It's more of a technical question about Torbrowser: "how to build a
Torbrowser-only compatible router", described at a high level.
