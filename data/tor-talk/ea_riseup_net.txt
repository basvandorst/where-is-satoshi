[Sending from a differentaccount, while my tormail is messed up - eliaz]
The problem described below might be clearer from this copy of a screen

@_subject: [tor-talk] how useful is tormail? 
I haven't been able to access my tormail account for days.  Does anyone
know what's going on there?
In view of the recent posts regarding the reliability/privacy of
tormail.net, and my own ignorance of this stuff, I'm asking: How useful
is tormail to those using the onion network to circumvent official
censorship? Clear ISPs reached via exit nodes are sometimes a problem.
For example msgs can be sent to a tormail acct. from a verizon account,
but verizon considers mail coming from a tormail account to be
malicious.  So it seems that having email providers completely within
the onion network would be a good thing.  Am I missing something here? -

Thanks to to you both for the info & leads. Yes, I got a lot of Lavabit
blocks while I was roaming around in their site, even with changing tor
identity. It seems that regardless of identity the same exit node is
being used. I might try one day asking Lavabit how friendly they are to
the onion network.
I was under the impression that tormail.net was some sort of hidden
service. It is, as are the others Griffin mentions, a site hosted
somewhere on the clearnet, correct?
Does anyone know if riseup.net is tor-friendly? - eliaz

Thanks for the clear explanation, it makes perfect sense. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] anonymity at the outset 
Something's been bothering me since I began contributing bandwidth to
the Tor network. Now that I've been running a bridge for awhile and feel
more or less confident of what I'm doing, I guess I can ask what may be
a dumb question.
The elementary illustration of how the tor network carries msgs shows
Alice's machine connected to the first node of an OR path.
Isn't it more accurate to show Alice's machine's first connection to be
to her ISP?
And if this is true, is not the initial hop past the ISP's gateway a
place of no anonymity?
If someone at the gateway were inclined to snoop, wouldn't be in effect
a MITM attack? - eliaz

Thanks, Roger, for the illustration - it's a great help to me and also
helpful in my explaining to others why I stay so many nights messing
around with Tor. As soon as I get a chance to improve the readability of
the orange and white labels, I'm gonna print it out and put it on the wall.
Your links led me to the discussion of incentives.  Anticipating a
following post, I'm wondering if a useful incentive might be to develop
criteria of bridge reliability and then use that to offer bridge
operators promotion to the portable transports list? - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] Individual bridge outdated? 
My bridge usage in Vidalia has fallen to near zero since I've installed
portable transports; as a matter fact most of the traffic comes from a
remote dummy client I use for testing. I think this is a it should be,
but it brings up a few questions.
Examining how portable transports work it occurs to me that a user user
in a censoring country who has the package installed need not go through
the routine of the Setting > Network tab in Vidalia. That being the
case, was see utility in continuing to set up and run individual bridges?
Which relates to another question I've been wanting to ask for quite a
while. How is a bridge located in non-censoring country A useful to
someone in country B located an ocean away?  From the Message Log and
Network Map it's obvious that the bridge in A is furthest away from, not
nearest to, those who need it.
I'm not trying to be contentious, just wishing to understand more so
that I can be as helpful as possible. - eliaz

Since no one replied to my post, I assumed that (typos aside) my
questions were indeed dumb. So I took time to really RTFM. They were. -
