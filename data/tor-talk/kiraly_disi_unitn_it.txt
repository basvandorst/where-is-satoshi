That's a nice small platform, but you might also want to have a look at systems based on VIA processors (C3, C7, or the new Nano), that have embedded HW crypto acceleration.
I'm not sure about prices, but I think it could be in the same range as the GumStix.
I had 20 mbps onion routing (2 decryption + 1 encryption) performance from a 1Ghz C3. It could almost keep up with a P4 on that.
I know this is not the current speed in Tor ORs, still it might be interesting for the long term.
Best Regards,
