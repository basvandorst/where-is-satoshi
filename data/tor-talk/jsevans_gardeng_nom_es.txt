Thanks for the article. This is something that I'm interested also.
I've been wondering about the feasibility of using Tor for low level,
low priority applications such as connecting servers with Saltstack,
setting up Jabber servers, or IRC.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Forward to Onion 
Hi all,
I had this idea this morning. Would there be a way to automatically
forward a visitor using Tor to a .onion domain that a website might
host when they attempt to go to an external .com/etc site?
For example, you type in  and either the website
or the browser forwards you to  so you
have slightly better speed and are not at the mercy of a potentially
nosy exit node.
My thoughts are that a browser plugin could do this if the Tor Project
or the EFF were to sponsor it. It could also be done with javascript
but that would mean going to the website first thus using the exit node
at least once and also the hassle of using javascript (insecurities and
My questions: Is this a good idea? Would you implement that on your own
website? How could the safely be done?
Best Regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] /etc/hosts for .onion 
Hi all,
One of the things that I've been working on lately is getting salt-ssh
working over tor. The salt-minion, by default, looks for the salt-
master using the hostname, "salt". I know that I can manually change
that to xxxxxxxx.onion but I would like to know if anyone knows how of
a way in *nix to alias local hostnames to .onion names the same way
that /etc/hosts does that with local names and IP addresses.
Thanks for your time!

@_subject: [tor-talk] hidden service - for dummies ? 
First of all, I'm writing this for Linux as I don't know IIS and I've
never used apache on Windows. Use any Linux distro that you want listed
below. I do not recommend Tails as it is not meant for web servers.
OK, so there are two parts.  1. Set up tor. 2. set up your web server.
Part 1: Install tor.  
$ sudo zypper in tor (opensuse)
$ sudo apt-get install tor (debian/ubuntu/mint)
$ sudo yum install tor (fedora)
Edit the /etc/tor/torrc file.
$ sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
Uncomment the following lines:
 /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
 80 127.0.0.1:80
Restart tor
$ sudo systemctl enable tor && sudo systemctl start tor
Get your new onion name
$ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname
Part 2: Set up a web server.
$ sudo zypper in apache2 (opensuse)
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 (debian/ubuntu/mint)
$ sudo yum install httpd (fedora)
Create the files for your very basic website in:
Finally enable and start apache.
$ sudo systemctl enable httpd && sudo systemctl start httpd (fedora)
$ sudo systemctl enable apache2 && sudo systemctl start apache2
(everything else)
You now have a very very basic onion site. It is not secured beyond the
protections that tor inherently provides.
I think is about as "for dummies" as it can be without someone
scripting it beforehand.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Getting de-anonymized with SSH 
Hi all,
First of all, I know that the best way to stay anonymous on Tor when
browsing the web is to use the Tor Browser and be smart about how you use
What about when you're not using the web? If I am using ssh over Tor, is
there a good chance that I can be de-anonymized? By this I mean ssh to an
onion service not to the external internet.
I would think that it is more safe than the web since you don't have to
worry about things like javascript, etc.
Am I correct, or are there other things that I am not aware of? Thanks!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Getting de-anonymized with SSH (J. S. Evans) 
Hello, first of all, thank you for the feedback.
I would like to be specific what I have in mind. In /etc/tor/torrc, I uncomment these lines:
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
I then start the tor service and block port 22 with my local firewall so no normal TCP traffic goes to it.
I only access it remotely via "torsocks ssh xxxxxxxxx.onion"
I wasn't thinking about potential issues with the certificate. Thanks for bringing that up, I'll look into that. Vanilla telnet might be an option. Obviously, you would never do that in the open internet, but it's not such a bad idea within the confines of Tor and it's inherent  From what I can tell, torsocks acts like a wrapper around the application that I am trying to use, in the case of my example, it is only the ssh client in most Linux distros. Does torsocks block or intercept DNS requests or does it just allow those requests to go through Tor? If it's just a passive proxy, I will need to research how to keep the ssh client from trying to use DNS.
I don't think this would be an issue in my situation as there would be one application only using Tor and not the entire system.

The Tor Project sent out an email yesterday, "Activists & News Orgs:
Onionize Your Sites Against Censorship". While I think it's a good
start. Is there a project in place to encourage legitimate websites to
One of the problems that is often discussed about The Tor network is
that there are a lot of "bad" neighbors there i.e. drug trafficking,
illegal materials, etc. which is why so many people associate Tor with
"The Dark Web".
I would be interested in working to see organizations use Tor for
legitimate privacy and security uses.
