@_subject: [tor-talk] Not able to download Tor to droid 
The url Tor was downloaded from is guardianproject.info/apps/orbot  direct download(.apk).  I tried doing so again and the tablet operating
system indicated it had downloaded, -- but had not.  I did get rid of all
the google and other commercial apps on the tablet.  Every one I could
find.  Are any of these apps required to download Orbot? -- Will not
download from the google store since they want registration and do track. The ISP does not appear to be a factor since it is public, a coffee shop. Have had no problems downloading Tor updates to Windows machines there.
The droid I'm trying to download Tor to is a tablet, not a phone.  Thanks
for your help.  libertyinperil

With technical problems at Rugged Inbox Friday and Saturday, I was not
able to respond over the weekend.  Sorry.  I did try to download from
  It remarked on the screen the download had indeed
begun, but was not completed.  -- Had already tried to look for the
earlier Tor download on the hard drive, but believe I had already deleted
it before re-attempting to download Tor the other day. Regardless, it was
not on the Menu.  Also tried looking for Tools/Downloads in Firefox as
suggested, but couldn't find it.  Since I can't find the new download,
think I probably need to do a factory reset.  Apparently, the tablet needs
at least some of the factory apps to successfully download Tor.  Although
the download problem was there BEFORE I deleted the google apps.  The
droid release is 5.0.  While I was able to scour the Menu, there isn't a
better way to search the hard drive on a droid as in Windows?  Thanks
again to all of you. libertyinperil

Thanks for the quick response.  Relieved to learn re-installing apps won't
be necessary.  Still can't download both droid tools to the tablet,
however.  How do I get around this problem?  libertyinperil

I enabled Downloads on the droid tablet.  When I went to launch it, the
operating system remarked Downloads stopped running.  How do I enable it? Apparently, this may be why I cannot download F-Droid and Orbot.  Any
ideas? libertyinperil

Have used Tor for years with no problems on Windows.  Tried to download
Tor to a new RCA droid tablet and kept getting message "This is not Tor."
This was done before shutting off all apps designed by Google to line its
pockets.  With everything turned off that could be turned off, it no
longer downloads at all.  Received an error message from Firefox when all
apps were installed that there is indeed a bug problem with downloads of
over 1Mb long.  Can you help?  Kindly remember I am not a software
engineer, only a user.  Don't have the expertise your techs and engineers
have.  Appreciate whatever help you can give.  Thanks.
