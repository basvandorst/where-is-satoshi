@_subject: [tor-talk] Are webmail providers biased against Tor? 
I can verify Hearn's (Google's) statement from my own experience at least. I am a long time user of the privateinternetaccess VPN. If I log into gmail from Germany, London, US East or US West or from home in New Zealand, I no longer get asked for validation when using an anonymous proxy. However, when I logged in via the new riseup.net VPN (Seattle) recently, or whenever I use an unfamiliar PIA proxy, I have been asked for validation.
So google is keeping track of which regions (IP ranges?) I'm coming from, and adjusting my profile. It took google several months to stop asking me if I wanted to change my default search engine country, but their algorithm did eventually back off.
I think 'track record' is the relevant point. Everywhere is suspicious until you have a track record of accessing google from there. Tor by design is meant to prevent any track record from developing.
