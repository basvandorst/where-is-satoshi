@_subject: Tor-Server and dynamic ip. 
my provider cut's the connection hard every 24h. Whats going on with all the clients,
they are using my server? Will they run in timeouts, or solves the entire tornetwork
this problem?
Its an good idia to stop my runnig server before provider cuts my internetsession with
cronjob ( /etc/init.d/tor stop )
an start it new after reconnect and ip-change?
