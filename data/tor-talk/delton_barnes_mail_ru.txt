@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser usability - frequent broken connections 
I use Tor Browser for all web browsing as many of you probably do.  A
frequent problem is you will be logged in to various sites and then the
connection will break.  For instance, attempting to make any request
gives "Firefox could not establish a connection to the server at ...".
Changing identities will always rectify the problem, but doing so via
the onion button causes all open windows and tabs to be closed, which
means you have to log back in and then get back to whatever page you
were on.  This is especially troublesome if you were filling out a form
or completing a multi-step process in a web application.
Is there a way to change identities or just circuits without closing
everything and without using an external application?  I understand the
browser is closed and re-opened when you request a new identity to
prevent your identity from being associated with your prior identity,
but sometimes you do not need a new identity and just want to fix the
I do not think this a problem specific to me because it occurs on
multiple devices on multiple networks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Not prompted to update Tor Browser 
I am running Tor Browser 3.6, but have neither been prompted to update
to 3.6.1 nor 3.6.2.  Usually Tor Browser checks for any new versions and
alerts you if it is out of date.  I checked and there were security
updates in 3.6.2.  Is everyone else getting these update notifications,
but not me?

@_subject: [tor-talk] CloudFlare one site, multiple domains problem 
There is a forum website I frequent in Tor Browser that uses two
CloudFlare domains. One (say "example.com") is the main website, and the
other (say "example.org") provides static content such as images and
A CloudFlare CAPTCHA is almost always presented when accessing
example.com. After completing it, example.com loads fine, but all
requests to example.org get a 403 response (as observed in Network tab
of Developer Toolbar). The result is the forum is unusable. Strangely,
if I manually enter any of the individual example.org URLs that received
a 403 response in the same tab, they load fine (200 response).
Has anyone encountered this problem? If so, is there a good workaround?
Usually I switch Tor circuits until I get one that does not block
Unfortunately I cannot share the website as doing so could identify me.
Also, I have been unsuccessful getting the administrator to whitelist
Tor (e.g., by using recently publicized GitHub script).
