Thanks for the feedback!
Regarding sslh - if I understand correctly, this can be used to
differentiate packets based on the actual payload that was received? If so,
what I meant was that since the TOR protocol is encapsulated within TLS, as
is HTTPS traffic, then the differentiation will have to occur after the TLS
handshake, which (assuming Iran/China/etc do not have a forged
certificate), cannot be viewed by anyone other than the site operator.
However, we could setup sslh after a daemon that performs TLS handshakes,
then run the site and the bridge after that (is that what you meant?).
As for Telex, I've never heard of it before, but I think it's a neat
concept. Maybe something like Telex can be used by the hosting services on
which large sites are hosted (instead of at the ISP level). That might be
more affordable (less TLS handshakes to sift through), and would also be
completely transparent to the site operators (and thus have a higher chance
of actually accepting it).
What do you think? Also, I'd still like to know if this is less of a
problem nowadays (is there a new and better way to distribute TOR bridge
addresses without getting them blocked?)
