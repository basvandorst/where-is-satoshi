Hi Tor Talk,
Lurker and user of Tor here. Thanks y'all for your hard work making Tor
Joe Btfsplk joebtfsplk at gmx.com:
I use riseup. My current storage quota -- which I believe would be
yours, were you to sign up -- is 92 MB. Riseup says the storage
quota fluctuates a bit and might go up in the future. I think you
can also request a higher quota if you have good reasons. Since I
mostly POP everything out, the quota doesn't cause me trouble. Maybe
it would if I suddenly became famous/notorious while in an extended
coma, receiving a zillion Twitter auto-emails notifying me of new
followers. :) :(
My attachment limit is 2 MB, which is reckoned per email -- I assume
it'd be the same for you. The attachment limit presents something of
a difficulty for me, a freelance writer, since big .DOCs and .PDFs
can exceed 2 MB. But clients can deal with workarounds.
Never seen an ad on Riseup (of course, I use adblockers). I don't
know if there's a size limit for incoming attachments.
I don't think they offer premium services, but I could be wrong.
It's free with donations strongly encouraged.
One good way to donate to Riseup is through Flattr!
 With Flattr you can
shoot Riseup a micro-donation via a flattr click, a recurring
subscription of flattr clicks, or just send a straightforward
donation up to your monthly Flattr donation limit, which as of this
May is EUR150.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TAILS: Please include a real IRC client (Pidgin 
Tor user and list lurker here. Pidgin for Linux does not[1] have
out-of-the-box support for IRC SASL authentication, which is important
to have (for example, [2]). (There are two Pidgin patches[3, 4] for SASL
authentication support, but they are beyond my skill level to implement,
which means they are out of reach for many, many people.) Thus I agree:
Tails should have a proper IRC client!
1. 2. 3. 4.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Email provider for privacy-minded folk 
I use riseup as well. They have always been great for me, including when
I've had a minor problem or two -- such as when emails from a list for
freelance writers were accidentally marked as spam. That ticket was
fixed right away. The only trouble I have with riseup is the 2 MB limit
for outbound email attachments. I sometimes have to send large documents
(PDFs, DOCs) to clients, and a larger limit would be convenient. I
should ask riseup about raising it; I would be willing to pay for that.
If you use riseup, be sure to donate. You can donate to them through Flattr.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia error message with TorBirdy 
Do you recommend any Firefox plugin in particular for this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] no more Vidalia for TOR, what if... 
Seems that right there, at the green onion button, there could be, under
"New Identity," a selection for "New IP address" that would retain the
old functionality.
