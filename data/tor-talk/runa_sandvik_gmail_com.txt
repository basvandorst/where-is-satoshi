@_subject: tor removed from ubuntu jaunty 
Ubuntu has this strange way of maintaining the packages in hardy and
intrepid. It seems like you have to request a backport if you want a
new version of package foo. You then have to build this package on the
distro you wish to backport it to, test it and then include the
results in the bug report. Loop this for every new release of package
No one had requested a backport to hardy and intrepid _with_ the
documentation necessary. I know that it was pointed out that the tor
project does have packages ready for both hardy and intrepid, but it
seemed like the developers wanted someone to "officially" build,
install and test the packages, as well as test for regressions etc.
Also, Martin Pitt said that he would sponsor the packages for hardy
and intrepid soon, and care about the rest. It seems like things are
moving forward, slowly. Those interested can follow the bug report in

Hi everybody,
I'm excited to be able to work for the Tor project in this year's
Google Summer of Code! I would like to say thank you for giving me
this opportunity and for helping me get more familiar with Tor, and a
special thanks to Jacob Appelbaum for being my mentor.
My name is Runa Sandvik and I am studying computer science at the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am currently
in my second year of a bachelor's degree. I plan to continue on to a
master's programme, in either networking or information security once
I have graduated next year.
This summer I will be working on the translation wiki for the Tor
website - making it possible to translate the website via Pootle. My
application abstract can be found here:
I will post some notes to this list about my progress during the
summer, as well as blog about it on Feel free to find me in  on OFTC (or write an email) should you
want to discuss this project or ask any questions :)

@_subject: Out-of-date Tors (was Re: 25 tbreg relays in directory) 
The packages were outdated simply because no one wanted to maintain
the packages in ubuntu. You do not have to be an ubuntu developer to
do this (you can have a developer sponsor the upload of your package),
but you need to know how to package software for ubuntu.
The problem seems to be that people are interested _now_. That isn't
good enough if we tor in ubuntu to be maintained and well taken care
of. If you start working on a project like this, you have to keep
doing so. Or at least find someone else who can take over for you.
I am going to look into the process of becoming an ubuntu developer
(better than having all of my uploads sponsored) and then try to get
tor back in ubuntu. When that time comes, I'll send an email to the
list so that other people can help out too.

The goal of this email is to summarize what's happened on the
translation front recently, and to answer some of the questions that I
have been asked either on IRC or in emails.
In July, I upgraded Pootle on This version has an improved interface and seems to be working a bit
better than the previous version we used. I am currently researching
other translation portals and looking into automatic/machine
A number of people have asked how we can make it easier to translate
the website. In some cases, line breaks in the middle of strings makes
it hard to diff changes and some strings don't really need to be
translated, such as ''. This is
something that I am looking into, and I believe that automatic/machine
translations can help with some of these issues.
I know that some people have stopped translating because they don't
like the web interface. While we cannot give translators direct access
to the SVN repository, we can give some of you permission to upload
and overwrite existing translations in the translation portal. If you
want this option to be enabled for your user, please send me an email.
Also, The Tor Project is looking for more translators. We have some
funding and lots of t-shirts. Email tor-translation at torproject.org if
you are interested.
Let me know if you have any questions and/or suggestions.

It is not recommended because it "can mess up your anonymity in ways

Germany you have have less relays to choose from than if you used
*any* exit relay in the world. This applies to Entry and Exit, as well
as Exclude.

Hi everyone,
The Tor Cloud project gives you a user-friendly way of deploying bridges
to help users access an uncensored Internet. By setting up a bridge, you
donate bandwidth to the Tor network and help improve the safety and
speed at which users can access the Internet.
Setting up a Tor bridge on Amazon EC2 is simple and will only take you a
couple of minutes. The images have been configured with automatic
package updates and port forwarding, so you do not have to worry about
Tor not working or the server not getting security updates.

free usage tier. The Tor Cloud images are all micro instances, and new
customers will be able to run a free micro instance for a whole year.

Hi everyone,
The Tor Cloud [1] images for all the seven regions have been updated to
include the latest cloud image for stable Ubuntu release 10.04 LTS
(Lucid Lynx). These new images are available on the Tor Cloud website.
If you are already running a Tor Cloud bridge, you will need to either
manually update your image, or set up a new Tor Cloud bridge and
terminate the old one. If you decide not to take action, your image may
fail to download package updates correctly. What follows is an important
message from the ubuntu-cloud mailing list [2]:
    In an effort to improve on reliability of the Ubuntu archive mirrors
    for EC2 instances, Canonical is replacing the existing EC2 archive
    mirrors with mirrors backed by Amazon S3. This change itself will be
    done via modification of DNS entries and will be transparent to users.
    However, due to a bug in the http pipelining implementation in S3 a
    change to apt configuration needs to be made to avoid download
    errors. We have chosen to deliver this change via a package upgrade
    in cloud-init.
    The *action required* is one of the following:
    a). upgrade cloud-init:
        $ sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install -y cloud-init
    b). launch official AMI's released after 2012-04-01, which will have
        the fix included.
    c). manually disable http pipeline use in apt:
        $ echo 'Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth "0";' |
          sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-no-pipelining
    Should you choose not to take appropriate action, you will likely
    experience transient apt downloading errors after the change is
    implemented. In order to give appropriate time to apply the change,
    this transition will not occur before April 18, 2012.

It does, unfortunately. A bridge pushing 15 GB per month is not nearly
as useful as a bridge pushing 40 GB per month (which seems to be the

Hi everyone,
We have been discussing setting up a Q&A page for a while now. Last
night, I proposed a Stack Exchange page for Tor on [1]. The detailed
version about how this process works can be found on [2], but here is
the tl;dr:
A user proposes a new page, other users follow said page, and users
create and vote on hypothetical questions. Each user can only ask 5
questions, I am not yet sure if there is a limit to how much you can
vote. Once the page reaches enough followers and questions with a high
score, the page moves into the "Commit" phase. A small number of users
will need to commit to help building the site. Once that's done, the
page goes live and is considered to be in "Beta".
The proposal is currently in a "Definition" phase. To move to the next
phase, we need (1) a high number of followers of the page, and (2) a
collection of good, relevant questions.
If you want to help promote our Stack Exchange page, sign up on Stack
Exchange [3], visit our proposal page [2], log in*, follow, ask 5
questions, and vote on other questions.
* You will notice that while [3] has SSL enabled login, [1] does not.
I have raised this issue with Stack Exchange already and hope to hear
back soon.

Nadim, I said this on Twitter and I will say it here too; the right
place for this discussion is on the Stack Exchange proposal page. It
is not up to the Tor Project to decide what goes and what does not on
this page, it is up to the community.

Stack Exchange proposals and pages are very much community driven. We
need help from the community to make our page a success. There is a
discussion on our proposal page about whether we should limit the page
to Tor-related questions or not;
I agree with Nick's statement about seeing how things develop and
revisit the question later. I am concerned that including other
anonymizing networks and tools, such as Freenet and I2P, will make the
site too broad. I would also like to encourage you to comment on the
proposal page instead of the tor-talk mailing list. The proposal page
is a good place for a discussion about what the page should and should
not be.

After selecting an image and clicking through a few screens, you
should see a window with "Your instances are now launching". You
should then be able to see this instance in the main list, with "2/2
checks passed" and the state "running" You do have to make sure that
all four required ports (22, 443, 40872, 52176) are open in the
firewall (called the security group).
You can connect to the instance with ssh and use arm (with sudo -u
debian-tor arm) to look at different stats, such as bandwidth, logs,
configurations, connections, etc.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A note about the Stack Exchange private beta 
Hi everyone,
Last week, the proposed Tor page on Stack Exchange [1] reached 100%
commitment. Committed users will soon be invited to the private beta.
I wanted to clarify a few things regarding this "private beta" (big
thanks to the Stack Exchange team for replying to my email so
1. The private beta stage typically lasts for one week. The Stack
Exchange team may decide to extend the period to two weeks depending
on how it goes. The purpose behind it is to ensure that users who
committed to the site's proposal have a chance to start asking and
answering questions, as well as help with the initial community
building activities that will define and shape the site.
2. The more experts who participate in the private beta, the more
certain it is that our page will move on to the next stage (i.e. the
public beta). To get in on the private beta, visit the proposal page
[1] and click the "Commit!"-button. Those who commit to the proposal
now can invite others to join the beta later.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Newbie with a bunch of questions for Tor Cloud 
I'm glad you're considering contributing to the network!
We initially had images in all regions, but due to a bug/issue (see
 I decided to
temporarily remove all images except the ones in us-east-1. The goal
is to bring back images for the other regions at some point.
The operating systems would all be Linux based, so I'm not sure this
would make much of a difference.
The current image is a "standard" bridge, an obfs2 bridge, and an
obfs3 bridge. ScrambleSuit is not included. If you create an SSH key
when setting up the instance, you can log on and change whatever you
want. The Great Firewall of China blocks "standard" bridges and obfs2,
but I believe it has yet to block obfs3.
More likely than what?
The server stays up and checks for regular package updates from
Ubuntu. If someone were to break in, they would not learn anything
more than if they had set up a bridge themselves.
The Ubuntu image the Tor Cloud image is based off of is verified when
the image is built. The Tor package is verified as it is installed
(which happens within the first five minutes you boot the server for
the very first time).
The image has been configured to automatically check for package
updates. In addition, it is recommended that you only open certain
ports in the firewall (22 for SSH, plus 443, 40872 and 52176 for Tor).

The copy problem may have been fixed, but I have yet to try it out
myself. If you want to set up a bridge in a location other than
Virginia, spin up an Ubuntu instance and go through the steps in
If you want your bridge to just support the scramblesuit transport, yes.
Yes. The ec2-prep.sh script will only pull packages from the Ubuntu repository.
There will be emails on the tor-talk mailing list and posts on the blog.
Some, yes, you can change the ports if you want.
