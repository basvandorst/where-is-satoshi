I looked that up. Linux compat! Sounds alright! Thanks for letting me know.

Hi. Why does the Firefox browser in the torbundle constantly reset the home
page to the tor test page?
Why does Noscript 2.5.8 in options-advanced tab-do not filter objects coming
from these sites, not let you remove .hulu.com and .youtube.com?
Aren't these things possible privacy issues?

You can set it to anything but try closing vidalia and the browser and
opening it up and in a few more times you will find it is reset to the
original page. Nothing seems to get the settings to be preserved.
I did this and it also gets reset after awhile. I don't remember the name of
the key, I searched for it in about:config and changed it. It gets reset
after closing and opening again a few times.
It is a problem. If you close and go back and open it up again you will see
they get reset. I have tried this many times and have found no way of
deleting them.
I thought TOR and this mailing list were about free speech which I believe
in very much. If you must know I am a college-educated African-American man
in my thirties and have been involved in civil rights work including working
for the rights of people to demonstrate peaceably for things I personally
despise. Free speech needs to be free whether we personally like it or
not. I am a residential roofing contractor and I got these nicknames from
some of the black guys I work with. I am black, have been all my life and
it doesn't offend me, but I have a good sense of humor and think the world
could use one. If that bothers you I suggest you get your white on brotha!
If you check I think you'll see these settings appear to be accepted but get
reset after closing and restarting the torbundle a few times. Thanks for
trying to help with this. Peace!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Denied with disposable/free mail services? 
They're getting good too I have to search hard to find one to get past. It's
not only forums its almost any site with a signup.
Yeah brotha
gmail needs a cellphone sign up doesn't it?
it's BIG BROTHA, brotha! that ain't no lie and it ain't no good
There aren't THAT many free full service mail accounts in the English
language. Some of the crew I work with on civil rights gigs found some
foreign language sites and they use those. Basically because we have so damn
much money in the USA we have to pay. Most other countries realize the
people can't pay so they still give free email with IMAP/SMTP and they don't
have the money to make a police state like we have either. Except maybe
England with their cute little cameras taking everybody's pictures.

I downloaded the tbb again and I noticed there is only one version for
Linux, UNIX and BSD. I thought these were all totally different operating
systems. I just started with Ubuntu a few months ago so maybe I am
wrong. Does the tbb really work everywhere or is the comment on that
download dead wrong?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions on latest linux torbundle 
Hello Tortians and thanks for this interesting software.
I am testing out the latest linux torbundle. I have a few questions on this.
If I change the firefox homepage to about:blank and select "when tor browser
starts display a blank page" it gets reset after I run the start-tor-browser
script a few times. Isn't this bad for anonymity because going to the same
home page every time is a nice fat bullseye to be able to correlate a
webpage of known size with every tor startup. Why are these settings being
overridden and is this a problem?
Noscript 2.5.8 that comes in the torbundle. In the Noscript options-advanced
tab-do not filter objects coming from these sites, it seems impossible to
remove .hulu.com and .youtube.com. Isn't this bad because youtube is
embedded on nearly every site and isn't this an attack vector? I don't want
youtube enabled. I don't want anything permitted by default and I changed
noscript settings but they keep getting reset.
Those who surrender essential liberties for temporary security are going to
end up being groped and ultimately get butt-fucked by TSA employees on the
way to work everyday..
