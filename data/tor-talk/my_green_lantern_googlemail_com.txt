@_subject: torrc file changes and features - reversal request & possible bug. 
I have recently upgraded to v0.1.2.19 (after a long time being unable to upgrade due to vidalia control of tor problems - no appears to be fixed) and after I noticed the location of torrc had been changed to the vidalia dir I updated the torrc to include my ExcludeNodes lists.
I used to list these with comments telling me what they were there for (eg who they were if I had to use a server hash rather than the name and what the reason was for excluding them) and I used multiple lines to keep it neat for me the user.
Here's as sample (names fictitious - hopefully)
"# exit node fails to exit .. eg  may be fire walled
ExcludeNodes mabbaschina,netluxor
# Unamed China (Beijing) ip 238.86.234.99
ExcludeNodes $66666666666666E733AB541B28242400694
# Redirects to child porn site for some google searches (words like ExcludeNodes UnDeclaredName,DogsTor"
But this latest version (at least) of tor deletes all the user comments and also deletes all but the last line of any ExcludeNodes lines, all other ExcludeNodes line details are lost.
Is there any way these can be changes can be reversed???
So that,
1. Multiple ExcludeNodes lines are accepted and left as is in the torrc 2. User Comment lines are left AS is and untouched. Maybe a user comment line would be designated by a "+" or "/" or " so to be left in.
I can also think of other torrc commands which might be easier to use if  placed on multiple lines similar to the ExcludeNodes I suggested above.
Bug report... a peculiar bug(??)
when I put 8 ExcludeNodes onto the list (7 seems to be OK) then when I use gmail (smtp port 25) then it fails and I get dozens of  tor  circuit build fail attempts..
Piece of tor log..

If I then remove the 8th ExcludeNode its OK.
My line is..
ExcludeNodes Remove NetworkPimp and its OK.
So I tried removing askatasuna instead and this also does not work (creates huge number of circuit builds as well with only 7 nodes in list).
But the line "Excludenodes NetworkPimp"  is OK. Not sure whats going on.. could it be a port 25 build circuit problem??

OK, many thanks coderman.
It was not very clear, but I now think the gmail help appears to say that gmail automatically blocks (with total deletion) any email "from" its own email address, as an anti-spam feature.
I can't seem to find a setting to switch this "feature" off with.
The problem I (and I guess other gmailers) have is I don't know my email to or-talk was successfully sent out or not. Theory is not the same as practice. So I keep having to go over to a friends pc to be sure.
I might set up another account, of my own, to check receipts. Seems to be the only solution.

True, but it usually required the user to save settings (something I have learned never to do)
Yes, I've had to use a very old version on Win2K(sp4) because of a control bug between vidalia/tor which appears to be fixed now in tor v0.1.2.19, vidalia v0.0.16.
When I changed to these new versions (downloaded direct from tor site - no proxy) I found that Tor did not use the usual torrc file in the Docs&Settings/Admin.machine/Application Data/Tor folder.
But it did use the torrc file in the next door Vidalia folder.
So I added my stuff from the Tor folder torrc file to the Vidalia folder torrc file.
But without any Vidalia update settings "save" in details by me, this Vidalia folder torrc file was updated. Now I am using the "randomly generate password" setting so maybe its automatically rotating the password (??) and updating it in this torrc file.
However, this Vidalia folder torrc file does state "# This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be preserved". So I assumed it was actually the real torrc file, not one generated by Vidalia. And bearing in mind the facts that my attempts to modify the tor behavior via the Tor folder torrc file failed, I pretty much thought that this confirmed it.
Are you suggesting that the torrc file in the Vidalia folder is not the real torrc file?
(If so then I would suggest that Vidalia devs should have named it something else to avoid confusion.)
Also, bearing in mind that the HashedControlPassword is in the Vidalia folder torrc file but not the Tor folder torrc file, then should Tor (I suppose via Vidalia) have used the Tor folder torrc file at start up? There seems to be a problem here but I'm not sure wh'o fault it is (tor or vidalia)
(As I said it does not appear to do this at the moment.)
Actually, is quite easy, you just use an object stack/list for each line in the torcc file. Additional lines added from any user input (from say vidalia) can be appended to the stack/list according to object type (and even a link comment(s) above it if one is asked for), then you re-write the torrc file, straight from this object list. When you want to pass that information to tor you just sort the list by object type delete the "comment lines", amalgamate the object type data and send the now single instances of object data to tor. What you don't do is then write that de-commented, sorted object list straight back to torrc file, as vidalia might be doing now (assuming its vidalia's file).
Like so---
Stored file structure..
Object Type: CommentLine
Data: "Hello world"
Object Type: ExcludeNodes Data: "proctor,exactor,inspector"
[append... and rewrite torrc using this structure
Object Type: CommentLine
Data: "A.N.Other bad node"
Object Type: ExcludeNodes Data: "reactor"
for input to tor becomes (never written back to file),
Object Type: ExcludeNodes Data: "proctor,exactor,inspector,reactor"
If you need to update the torrc file after you have de-commented and sorted the object list, then you re-read it before the start of the edit, so you use the preserved the comment lines and original structure.
On vidalia v0.0.16, Windows (on Win2ksp4) version it does.
Thnx, -K-

Just a thought...
If any one was looking of the exit node that re-directs to porn sites, on some searches (I used webcrawler with search terms "Israel murder rape xxx" after I was given a name to look for, I got re-directed to an IP addy porn page (think it was pedo - I quickly closed the page before any images came up). Then I tried with the word "mystery" (via the same node), it came up regular no re-direct, so I put the some of the original search terms in again ("Israel rape murder") and again go the same porn re-diect ip addy.
This exit node was using the name "UnNamed", it was from Bochem (or was that Bochim??) Germany and kept changing its IP addy. I did have its full hash id but that was on of those lines that was deleted from my torrc file.
All those "UnNamed" nodes out there are creating hell when it comes to locating them so as to exclude them.

At first sight this appears to be an exit node problem but then, as I
read it, you say it occurs with more than one exit node and only at this
"higher" level of throughput.
Alarm bells are ringing ... to mix streams up like this then streams at
the "higher" throughput would have to be unencrypted clear streams - yes?
This would mean that either all tor exits are vulnerable and are mixing
the streams. Or that traffic is being passed wholesale *-unencrypted-*
between nodes (so that nodes other than the exit nodes are doing the
Sh*ttt.. whatever.. this is a major BUG.

@_subject: Mixed pages - serious bug of tor 
OK, understood. I thought you had specified the Python code you were
using.. it appears to use multiple exits.
You need to try to identify the rogue exit node (or nodes) so we can
exclude it from our circuit builds. It could be an overflow but it could
be deliberate tampering admixture (not altogether uncommon on tor - it
happens every now and then). Try running repeatedly through only one
exit node at a time until you find the problem one.
Yes, but my point was it had to be admixture of the "clear" unencrypted
streams rather than encrypted streams, otherwise you would get garbage
out. Buffer overflow or not.
Maybe, but I gave the only 2 options to consider, this defines the scope
of the problem not the probability..
I guess that many of my page requests (I'm on 4mb broadband with dual
processor) should be getting this kinda error, but I do not. I just see
it once in a while (maybe once every 200+ pages) and then I try to zap
the exit node if it occurs repeatedly. This makes me wonder why you are
getting it so often.

I have installed the latest tor (vidalia 0.1.9, tor 0.2.0.31) bundle for windows. This time I downloaded it via tor rather than through the open internet as I had previously.
With the previous version I could see  fully built 1, (2 - maybe ?? - once), 3, 4 and 5 hops circuits.
With this latest version I can now see fully built 3, 4 and 5 hops circuits.
I have screen shots of 4 and 5 hops circuits in on vidalia's connection window. If anyone would like copies, please email me.

@_subject: same first hops 
Does this already happen?
This has been suggested many times.. but never, to my knowledge, Its one way to add real entropy to the tor network traffic, circuits (specified user setting min max hops) could randomly vary between say 3..5 hops.
Also 1 and 2 hop circuits would be useful (& add more entropy) for where a person only wanted a simple exit ip proxy. This is useful nowadays for 2 reasons,
1.  where some forums have "bad","nuisance" ip blocking lists. Some clever forum admins (contrary to forum rules) will put someones ip on this list to (illegally) stop them posting a reply, usually if the admin is abusing their power and losing some argument with someone on the forum. When challenged this admin will claim they had nothing to do with it and that it was the "automated protection mechanism". So to be able to have a large number of simple proxies to hand immediately is very useful.
2.  for anonymously seeding/downloading  torrents. Now, before you all shout, you must realize its getting more difficult out there. People are getting sent huge fines for just downloading a movie they will junk the next day, based on their IP addy. Potentially, torrent traffic could provide a lot of cover for torland users. 3 or more hops is far too excessive. 1 (or 2) hops would be enough. It not needed for most torrents (eg legal porn) and 1 hop is not going to protect you from law Also been suggested before.
Perhaps it might be possibly to make very packet exactly the same size. Or at least a range (large medium small) of exact size packets. So they could not be told apart according to their exact data.
Also been suggested before.

I was using Tor stable install (v0.2.0.30 (r15956)) & Vidalia 0.1.8
on win2k and ExcludeNodes does not appear to work.
(or-talk "TOR v0.2.0.30 (r15956) - ExcludeNodes appears to fail" August 25th 2008)
Maybe the problem is related.
Curiously, I have also seen three instances 4 hops circuits and a single instance of a 5 hop circuit built, according to vidalia's connection map. Also all 4 circuits had a a curious IP address target with a UID:443 port exit node, when I was not requesting any traffic!
Not sure quite what to make of it.
Am I trojaned, with a special version of TOR, that does 4 and 5 hop circuits when it dials home?

@_date: 2008-09-28 08:22:16
@_author: Anon Mus 
@_subject: How to strictly exclude exit nodes? 
I can now confirm that dozens of 4 hop circuits can be seen in vidalia's "connections" list (no more 5 hops yet) and they are being used by the likes of vidalia and thunderbird just as the 3 hop circuits are.
I have also observed that large numbers of 4 hop circuits appear on startup of the tor client and pretty much disappear after a few minutes or so. This is probably why I only noticed the odd one before now.
Can anyone else see this?

I use Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12 browser.

At the same time my (soft & hard) firewalls block all direct internet access for both my Firefox  browser and any apps runninh in firefox. So Firefox and flash has no exit other than via TOR. I can see the flash traffic in Vidalia's bandwidth graph.
For direct internet access I use another browser entirely.

 From my experience there are (probably) govnt run sites in the US which do block a wide range of tor exit nodes. But they permit a few exit nodes, mainly from the US, to have full access.
So this is done whether or not you use excludeexit.
My experience of excluding nodes (exits or otherwise) is that there are generally plenty of nodes out there so as to keep you safe. And that in general terms only a few exit nodes are a problem at the moment.
Therefore I reckon that the ExcludeNodes, etc, options are very useful - we need them - place a "warning" label on their use if need be.

@_subject: eliminating bogus port 43 exits 
IMHO its unlikely that file sharers are ALL using port 43... you are more likely to see a wide spread of ports with high usage. I've found that sharers are not savvy enough to all pick port 43 because its more likely to be open. When I file share over TOR (once or twice a year max., to get seeding started, anonymously) I pick no particular port. Without a large anonymous Pron provider operating over TOR, its more likely that a very large organization (military - intell) has its own software communicating over TOR (hidden in ordinary port 43 "cover" traffic) on port 43. Obviously, this would be a globally distributed operation. Say... the US Mil&Intel. Of course, if its existence were discovered they would need to put up some sort of smokescreen, pointing the finger in the wrong direction, so to speak.
Of course... it could all be regular WHOIS traffic, as cover traffic, or just genuine. Maybe someone (MIL/GOV) has their own local WHOIS copy which is updated via TOR (??).
A little bloodhounding the port 43 IP addresses/domains would go a long way to seeing if they were at least all or mainly genuine WHOIS requests.

@_subject: eliminating bogus port 43 exits 
The thing is the port numbers list is NOT an exclusivity list... other people & systems may use these ports if they wish.
Its a misconception that these ports were exclusively assigned to the stated systems. Its only true that if you run/design these systems then you are asked (not required) to design using them (and only them).
The idea was to make it easier to open certain ports in corporate firewalls  for common services.
There is no form of enforcement of ANY sort, either of..
ports ONLY for certain services
services ONLY on certain  ports.
Of course, websites & organizations have the right to choose which ports they use for which services and open/close. Anyone trying to inflict that kind of system on any "internet" user community should STOP doing so immediately. Its called "port blocking" and its unacceptable.
Therefore ALL traffic, on ALL ports, are LEGITIMATE traffic, regardless of whether they comply with IANA's list or not.
My understanding was that Tor allows node operators to best configure their node to make the most of their particular resources (eg to get round fascist firewalls etc), as opposed to blocking ports because of arbitrary ideas of what services might/might not be used on them.
Of course, fascist firewalls are commonly the reason why a Tor user would set up communication over (more often not open) ports, like port 43, as it will not be blocked. And so, petty administrators are employed to reduce this supposed "unauthorized" traffic (tut tut) to a minimum.
I suppose some of these bureaucrats will use the IANA list as evidence of malpractice.

Of course. All relay operators have the right to protect themselves.  From trojans etc or spam generators.  This is why you can set up tor to provide its service on only certain ports.
But destination port blocking is a more difficult to approve of.
Obviously,  if you block port 25 traffic completely then all (usual, but not always, as it can be set up to another port) smtp will be blocked.. spammers & the rest of us included.
Now I used smtp (secure - not port 25) to deliver this email. Should you block this?
If so what about port 80?
I hate spam... but I've learned to live with it and so I use a spam filter. Thats the best way..
At the end of the day its YOUR relay .. as long as tor clients can find a good few routes from amongst all the relays out there, thats all that is needed.

I am certain there are funders outside the US but  whilst Tor remains a tool the US I would guess they'd be reticent to contribute and who could blame them.
I think you'll find that Tor only became officially incapable of protecting from such an adversary around 2004/5 when numerous request to add this protection to Tor was made. Since then  its been the official policy not to protect from such a threat (so as to head off any complaints it does not do the job perhaps ??).
It a good idea that you speak for Tor only, not other system here, where there are/have been genuine attempts to provide full anonymity, no get out clause.
Conspiracy theorist slander aside, FACT:  in the mid-1990's IBM had 80% of the Global Internet Traffic flowiing through their servers, paid for by US military contracts, all routed through the US, so the US -GOV could spy on the global internet traffic.

Actually, you haven't really worked it out yet, so let me try and put you on the right track.
If you have no protection from a global adversary using timing attacks, who had such massive access then there is NO anonymity for the ordinary Tor user, because there is ALWAYS a timing attack solution (from automated passive data analysis) which identifies the originating ip making exit node to open net request. Even the location of Tor hidden services  and their users is easy (and automatic).
So it matters not a jot that the US mil or gov uses the Tor service itself, even assuming that they are not using a modified Tor client to improve their anonymity and possibly aso identify their streams from the rest (only they will know how this can be done) .
Think  military, think intel community and never assume they are "playing the game". What would you do in their jobs?

Unfortunately, whilst there are clueful people watching the software, no one has yet decided to publically produce and share a modified version of this code which protects from a Global Adversary who is analyzing the traffic (real time or.not).
I await that day, but believe it will not be soon, because it would be foolish to take on such a task, only to have the Tor project themselves then radically change the code and so as to make the unofficial modification obsolete.
Well its obvious that who funds it get to make the decision as to what anonymity "protection" gets put in.
So if you were the Global Traffic Analysis Adversary then you would distract, delay, deny and defend lack of protection from your analysis. If you also funded the project then that would make that task easier.
So whilst there is no protection in Tor (by official policy) from the Global Traffic Analysis Adversary (aka US -GOV) then you can expect to unmasked for every usage you make of Tor. Unless of course, you were the US -GOV in which case you can add that protection into your Tor nodes and Tor clients.
For instance if I were US - GOV (i.e. it was my job to spy on your traffic) I would, at the very least,
1. Set up global INTEL network of private and institutional Tor servers.
These servers would be .edu, .gov, .net (running at legit ISP's), as well as from the homes of hundreds of operatives (police, CIA, FBI, NSA, Homeland Security), .mil (e.g. force bases overseas) and other .gov officials (embassy staff, trade orgs, propaganda orgs like Voice of America offices) globally.
2. On those INTEL servers, a modified Tor software would be run with modifications to create a supersecure subset of Tor.
These servers would either be self identifying (as the supersecure servers - SS) or receive a list of ips from a central server.
I'd give some of these SS servers name like anarchist, whacko, anarchist or anti-gov/big brov but their ip's would appear to be from telco's, R&D/Ops contractors..
3. Relatively minor modifications to the Tor code would add this extra protection and priority for the officially supersecure traffic. e.g.
i/ Higher/extra layer encription.
ii/Protection from Traffic analysis - extra long random length circuits (n = 3..6 variable), chaff traffic (70-90% variable chaff), multiplexed traffic (mixed circuit streams - TOP SECRET) and multiple route traffic (split circuit streams - EXTREME TOP SECRET).
iii/Traffic delivery Guarantees
4. Non-supersecure (normal) traffic would be labeled to separate its treatment (as well as logged with the identity ip of the originating Tor user. Potentially then the circuit builders Tor user ip could be sent on secretly, in another layer, to as far as it will go in this SSS Intel 5. Potentially, normal Tor traffic could be deliberately sent, by these SS servers, in specific traffic analysis timed sequences to make easier to pick it up when it exits the SSS Intel network by traffic analysis systems . A sort of traffic "signature" to be followed to the source.

Since Tor's inception (must be getting ion for 10 years now) it has been getting faster year after year, this is due to network  speed and bandwidth increases, which have been about a 200 fold (e.g. speeds of 100+Kbps max 2003 to 20+Mbps today).
OK, there have been some increases in  web page byte size but it not more than 10 fold.
That means a real speed increase of at least 10 fold. So perhaps Tor developers should start putting in some "timing attack" protection. It seems to me that the time is right. What is holding them back? Are they afraid of global big brother complaining they cannot identify users at will? Anonymous should mean anonymous, no?

@_subject: Torbutton Documentation - Adversary Capabilities. - fork:	Normalization 
Obvious really, I quote you (from above) "without imposing unacceptably high overhead" - if the speeds & bandwidth (you might like to read up on this subject) are up 10 fold then the latency is down. Pages load fast now, so there IS room for some extra "ovehead" now. Didn't you figure that out?
There are lots of methods that can be employed to resist against timing attacks... and there's definite resistance to implementing them, even though its obvious on first principles that they DO work and that other anonymity systems have/do use them. The obvious one are..
1. Bundling/Multiplexing individual streams into mixed streams, individual streams can even be split by over multiple routes then reconstituted. (means streams cannot reliably be followed). - adds entropy.
2. Caching by exit nodes (means streams cannot always be tracked from the external site) - adds entropy.
3. Variable (3-n random pattern) node size paths (means timing attack adversaries cannot EASILY predict route start and end) - adds entropy.
4. Random variable packet delay/sequence position transmission - adds 5. Addition of "chaff" traffic - adds entropy.
INCREASED ENTROPY is the KEY.
More entropy, the less certainty of the adversary of finding a timing attack solution.
At the moment Tor has the appearance of an ordered NETWORK/WEB/GRAPH - low entropy (predictable system), the above would make it look more like an amorphous CLOUD - high entropy (unpredictable system).
As for the rest you say below - as you are stuck with ever faster networks you'd better get used to it and put some ENTROPY into the Tor THE ABOVE 1..5 ALL THEORETICALLY INCREASE ENTROPY, which ACTUALLY makes it more difficult to make timing attacks on Tor - as you need MORE and MORE data on the MORE Tor nodes and users and the computational solution grows by the power of the number of nodes/users that have to be included in the timing attack solution. - why would you argue otherwise?
Well if is your attitude, then why have Tor in the first place? Seems to me you need to pull over and let those who are interested in making Tor secure against Timing Attacks take the road. That way Tor will at least be on the road to more being more secure than it is now.
Why get up in the morning?

Wow, there seems to be some sort of error, I thought (as per usual development practice) that as
"The current stable version of Tor is 0.2.1.27." then my "0.2.2.10-alpha" would contain the code up to and after "0.2.1.27-stable" (had 0.2.1.27-alpha been stable enough - as its normal development practice for a "stable" to be a "stable", a field tested, alpha build - with the same version number).
So if Tor is using usual development practice then why does the stable version manual ( have "*WarnUnsafeSocks" in it if there has been no stable build since it was introduced in *0.2.2.14-alpha ?
Also , I notice the manuals do not have deprecated commands in it any more (even if they are still supported). It might be wise to add these old commands particularly if they are still supported and give versions when they were deprecated/removed and versions when new ones were introduced. It shouldn't be too onerous. After all the manuals are going to be used by people who have different versions. It would then be possible to have just one manual covering ALL Tor versions, stable and dev.
StrictExitNodes 0|1
 (Added v?.?.?.?-alpha and v?.?.?.?-stable,
Deprecated v0.2.2.7-alpha and v?.?.?.?-stable, Removed v0.?.?.?-alpha etc - see replacement command StrictNodes)
Blah.. blah .. blah
Then we only have to check the ONE manual and all will be clear!

I hope this is only a temporary bodge. The new dev (alpha) version commands are NOT in the stable version and WILL keep on causing confusion if this is not resolved.
Well the commands are indeed IN the code and still supported and work, so there should be mention of them in the manual (as was done for the past X years now). Why not put them back in the manual and ONLY remove them in future when,
1. They are no longer supported at ALL in the current stable version
2. when the older versions are no longer compatible (e.g when from time to time we all have to update our older versions due to incompatible code)

A few months ago I saw this as well using a dual core 2.666, but I found a little trick which increases the coin production. Just re-boot every 2-3 days, then you usually get a flush of coins.
At the time I considered getting an i7, just out, which has on chip hardwired encryption circuits. Its lightning fast on generating the hashes and even half a dozen of these were generating bitcoins then anyone with lesser technology doesn't stand a chance.
It sounds to me like these are now being used. Time to upgrade. It would be interesting if anyone had experience of using the i7.
On the question of cost. If you have a machine which already has to run 24/7 (say a Tor node) then the extra cost of max CPU usage is about $5-15/mo. (My dual core costs about $15/mo without bitcoin)

I have no idea how to log (privoxy or tor??) these, maybe you could explain how its done, just in case they start happening again..
1. Connection Disconnected:
The browser has a little message "connection closed" on a white background (not a privoxy message).
When I watch the exits (using vidalia's "network map" ) that produce these messages (which are identical to those produced by chinese exits around 2005/6) I see circuit request which then sits there for about a minute, until eventually I get the message (above). Rarely the circuit itself sometimes dies but more often does not. If I ask for another url (e.g. msn.com etc) - this is immediately serviced correctly within a second or so.
2."You are using a proxy which is changing your data... refusing This is a short html document, with a black background, a title in bold "WARNING..", and then the rest in standard font size.

Yes this makes it very worrying that such high volume exits are "bad" servers, as they grab all your circuits' exit positions. If they a traffic loggers (ie spies) then Tor users are in trouble.
These were added because, as I already said, they were repeatedly (5+ times on 5 different circuits)  "unable to resolve DNS and so failed page access",. this is a standard privoxy message.
Prior to end August 2010, if this kind of message was received I just used to close the circuit and try again. Usually it would resolve by the 3rd try. I tested these exits to see if they could resolve other urls, they did so with ease, no errors.
But at the end August every time I closed the circuit I got one of the "blutmagie,blutmagie2,blutmagie3,blutmagie4" exits again and these could not resolve the DNS of webcrawler.com. So I did a little investigation and found that ALL these were not resolving this DNS but simple (web based) one hop proxies put on at the end of tor (globally) could resolve this dns.
So I placed them all (the blutmagie ones) in my ExcludeExitNodes this stopped the problem... and I was able to access webcrawler.com via TOR for a while.
A week later however the problem re-occurred this time with ..
So I put all the Amunet exits on the ExcludeExitNodes as well.
The next week the problem re-occurred with "spfTOR1,spfTOR2,gpfTOR1,gpfTOR2" so I Excluded them also.
And with a few more exits (all German/US) in the following weeks the problem was cured. No problems now for 2 weeks. Web pages are as fast as before I excluded these nodes.
I use webcrawler.com because it is multi-search engine and it has low bandwidth pages so its ideal for TOr users.
(Maybe another search engine, like google.com, owns/sponsors these exits and is blocking the resolution of its competitor ??)

Sorry Jim, thats what it says, if these are NOT refusing DNS resolution, then they ARE actively blocking access to named urls which are noncriminal in nature (like this one), if so, then thats even worse and for so many - implies ALL these exit nodes have a linked (organized) hidden agenda.
Try this... enter into your torrified/privoxyified browser the url "cobblers.za" and go get it.
You'll see the following privoxy message page entitled "404 - No such 404

When I was doing this with "webcrawler.com" that was the error that was eventually given, after it sat there for ages (unlike the example above which returns immediately), repeatedly trying numerous circuits with those exits, that I later excluded, and would sit there for 1-2 minutes trying, with my browser active (activity icon whirring), until finally this failed DNS resolution message appeared.
But these exits were resolving other urls OK (and plenty of them without any error, in fact, I started using msn.com because of this for a while - whilst still trying to get webcrawler.com to work now and then) and just a simple exclusion of these rogue exits solved the problem.

Yes Fabian I would think that ordinarily the failure to connect does occur about this frequent, it used to happen very frequently when lots of chinese exits were on-line.
But thats not what I saw in the case of this - what I saw was (very nearly - over 3 days) 100% failure (after the 1st day), on all circuits re-used or new on about 50+ attempts (some 20+ on new circuits, after I started closing the failed ones in an attempt to kick the system into proper use). Also, as I said most failed access circuits still survived.
I'll have a look using v3.0.16, but I'm not expecting any errors now that the access has been fixed.

Is it true that email SMTP & POP3 hosts (e.g. gmail's servers) can obtain from SMTP & POP3 clients (e.g. Thunderbird) data such as,
1. client time zone
2. client machine clock time
3. client machine time since last boot
even though its over Tor?
If so, can't these be used to trace a client machine which might also be accessing other, say gmail, accounts via the open internet (not via Tor) ? (I know it sounds paranoid, but surely it is theoretically possible)

Extract of header via Tor list from my email starting this thread...
User-Agent: Thunderbird 2.0.0.24 (Windows/20100228)
So there is my machines timezone (+0100) for starters...
and then there is my machines clock time (Thu, 02 Jun 2011 11:59:38) as well (its my clock time not google's), I don't know if more accurate values (down to milliseconds say) are shared to the mail server.
You should all be able to see that in your own headers.
Again, you could fingerprint my mail by client (User-Agent: Thunderbird 2.0.0.24 (Windows/20100228))
I am sure I read somewhere (eons ago) that the "3. client machine time since last boot" could also be seen by the mail servers (or was that just javascript??).
In this case the sending machine is the exit node, but I suppose some email clients might leak that, mine appears to leak (0.0.0.0).
Does anyone else have anything to offer?
Does anyone know if there is a mail client source code out there that I could modify to create a client that would send settable/random values?

Am still using an OS setting to change the timezone as TZ didn't work on the "sent at" time, just the received times.
Obviously, I now need to see the pop3 and smtp protocols and see what they can also leak, I am using the term "leak" in the sense that most Tor users would use it.. any output of de-anonymising  information.

@_subject: [tor-talk] US Senators Seek to Crackdown on Bitcoin 
This is very true and is something which differentiates BitCoin from a ponzi scheme. The ponzi scheme is ALWAYS based on nothing right to its bitter end.
But BC does have INTRINSIC value, because it...
1. has only a known/set limited availability
2. is provably unforgeable
these are the qualities desirable in ANY value based exchange token (barter), whether it be gold bullion, chickens or sheep. This is why England used the "tally stick", for a long time, when England had no Gold etc, it generated a barter system based it.
So BC is also a barter substitute (or currency), that is this all the same, its just a token between.
At the end of the day, it matters not a single jot what its current comparative value is, as long a people are trading it. For day to day transactions, it is ALL that is needed. But for horders, banksters and other similar blood sucking manipulators, they cannot predict its value in the long term, and this they hate, as there is no "promise to pay the bearer" anything. So they will slander it. As more people trade in it, then the more stable it becomes, as people get frightened a government will collapse (not just outlaw) it, then its use will fall and so too will its price.
I have had my own reservations about BitCoin, that is, that its designers did not anonymize BitCoins rendezvous and had non-anonymously centralized itself so it could be attacked by a hostile government, like it is being attacked now by the US.
I think it is highly likely that the drug supplier "Silk Road" is a protected CIA black op. to attack BC and to destroy it. This was an obvious draw-back right from the start and was the reason I stopped generating BC's a long while back. Governments and other evil people do not play fairly, so never assume they will. The designers of BC did assume just that, and that was there error. To design adn test it was one thing but the implementation had to be completely anonymous.
What needs to be done is that a NewBitCoin (NBC) system needs to be started up behind hidden services and for them to offer a swap with the existing BC. Perhaps there should even be "official" completely anonymous NBC consortium with several NBC servers each doing multiple NBC i.e. NBC1, NBC2, NBC3 etc (all interchangeable currencies - at least at the start), so as to be locationally robust.

Hi Moritz,
Thanks for the quick reply, this is all I needed to know.
I think that 30 mins might be a bit too long for anyone running a back-up redundant hidden service though. Its a shame you can't specify the time-out. for the hidden service or even to have some sort of random (balanced??) system. That way hidden services would not be so vulnerable to line/connection outage/blockage trace attacks - halt/block connections and see if the hidden service is lost.

I got a message to upgrade my Tor version..
Nov 10 10:20:45.953 [Warning] Please upgrade! This version of Tor (0.2.1.30) is obsolete, according to the directory authorities. Recommended versions are: 0.2.1.31,0.2.2.34,0.2.3.6-alpha,0.2.3.7-alpha

My vidalia is 0.2.10 which works fine..
Are there any solutions ? Or is Win2K no longer being supported by? , if so the tor sites download page should be changed to reflect that

I think my previous response covers this.
I quote,
"Actually, I've now found out that the problem is not this warning, but is the ERROR part only.
Nov 10 10:17:10.093 [Error] Error from libevent: event.c:1413: Assertion base failed in event_base_get_method
The warnings ALL go away when I correct the localnet address of the hidden service. Only the above error line  is then given.  (CHANGES MADE FOR CLARITY)
So this is still a problem, the libvent event failure c:1413.
So is Tor supporting win2k still or not and is there a fix or work around to this problem?"
Can I get a reply from someone on the tor dev team about this ERROR (warning messages are solved) and whether or not Win2k is being supported now or not?

As I understand it the random number generator in win2k is the same as the one in WinNT, Win2003, WinXP and Windows Vista.
Does this mean support for these Windows OSes is also to be withdrawn?
Perhaps you can ensure a full explanation is placed a warning on the Torproject web site otherwise lots of users will be using Windows operating systems which are vulnerable.
I would have thought a responsible Tor project leadership would have seen to this already! But not a word, WHY?
Obviously my questions are still NOT being answered, I QUOTE,

I re-iterate, can I get a reply from someone on the tor dev team about this ERROR and whether Win2k is being supported now or not?
Why no replies to genuine and relevant questions? The silence makes the Tor dev team appear to have something to hide.

I made no allegations WHAT SO EVER, I asked questions, that was all. I seem to have hit a raw nerve.
NOTE: I made no such statement, I asked the question, "was it still supported?", DON'T put words into someone else's mouth so YOU can make FALSE allegations.
Yes the "suspicion" as you call it (I would say it was advice/excuse), is well documented, Israeli (Mossad??) researchers published the weakness, its also in WinXP's that have not been updated.
To let people know to update would have been sensible considering how "Jake" was so concerned about it.
But REALLY, the attack requires access to the machine and must be on one that is kept  running 24/7 (frequent reboots defeat the attack), I boot my Win2k every time I use Tor via it.. I don't run a Tor node nowadays so its no a risk to others. But of course there may be WinXP (not updated) Tor nodes out there who are, but you seem to be unconcerned about that, otherwise you'd have seen my point about alerting the Tor community to update their WinXPs, wouldn't you.
I think I've covered most of this above.
Win2k is still a fairly popular OS (0.17%), when compared with most versions of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu > 0.1%) where all the versions of Linux have only 1.2%. (one seriously wonders why so much effort goes into the support for that OS.
Win2K is also very stable. I love using it, and it has my old dev stuff on it (I still have Win98, WinNT, WinSBS PC's and even Win95, Win 3.x & OS2 on disk).
Blah..  Snip because its OT argumentative..
Uhhh ??, so why would "Jake" write Tor-talk a message like that?
I asked my question on the 10/11/2011 at 10:39 , get your facts straight before you make such slanderous allegations.
I was not reporting the bug as such, I was asking if (as there was a bug and at the same time my old running version was telling me it needed replacing), it was being supported still, but I got curious replies, so I asked why, simple.
Perhaps you should have tested to see if it at least ran (sigh up) first (as is normal release practise) BEFORE you released it for use as stable, no?
Otherwise you should not have released it for use on Win2k, it is highly unprofessional, after all the Tor project is getting paid Tax Dollars to develop it, and its certainly NOT being developed for free, just free to It sounds like, sadly, you'll never know if it does or not, so why not just remove the claim that it still works on Win2k (with all SP's and I have a more "professional" solution to suggest, if you cannot get yourselves a copy of Win2k (all updates are still on MS site) from ebay (you'll need a pc with a boot manager also).
Try pointing me to the place (exact link - I don/t want access to dev suite/tools/sources) where I can download all the unstable tor.exe's that have been produced since the stable version that I am running (which still works - just), see my original post for details. Then I can test the exe's and  let you know where it changed to fail with this error message. Then you can do a diff on the code and take a look if you can fix.
Personally. I don't give a fig what you do, but I do expect software to work with the OSES it says it should work on and as a user I don't expect to be dissed about by dev teams.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is this a practical vulnerability? 
My experience is that there s already an easy method of identifying Tor hidden service nodes and this takes little time to do.
Let me explain why I come to that opinion.
Having  a static IP net connection, I set up a test web site as a Tor service on a Tor middleman server. That server had been a middleman server for about a year, no problems, no attempts to hack it in all that Within 24hrs of making that Tor hidden service live I could see, in my firewall logs, hundreds of repeated attempts trying to hack my server, directly from the internet, not via my hidden Tot service. All were attempting to access various types of services/permissions which were mainly focused on attempting to gain control of a "web page server". All attacks were from US based places of higher education (colleges and universities), most from establishments where Tor servers were situated but not from Tor servers themselves.
Now bearing in mind that I had only EVER requested 1 web page (a blank test page - requested about 4 times) from my own Torrified web browser (out and back so to speak), and no OTHER (external) page requests were EVER received via the Tor hidden service, as shown by its log. Then someone must have been able to immediately see the service enter and track its source, who then attempted to hack the web server itself and it appeared to be a group of about 3 or 4 persons, each trying different attack strategy over a 12 hour period. Hundreds of commands were sent, many in quick succession as if they were in some sort of script file, but some were live, at one point I even watched them live as they were coming in as I countered their hack attempts.
As a result of this I did some serious thinking about Tor and came to the conclusion that someone out there and I believe it is THE global adversary (USA mil/sec) is able see with perfect transparency all Tor Most Tor users see the Tor connections as merely a set of 3 or 4 connected nodes over which their traffic is routed, e.g. Tor1 - US, Tor 2 - Germany, Tor 3 France - EXIT. But in reality then internet is not like that, this is only the UPPER structure level. At the lower level the packets are routed over many dozens of sub-nodes, these nodes are invisible to the Tor map of your traffic. You can find out this info yourself if you wish to test out a single ROUTE to another IP address just by doing a traceroute url (tracert url for windows) command from a command line prompt window.  As you will see this is about a dozen hops to the average local url. But this is not the end of the problem, as some hops are hidden and they report only a virtual hop back to you.
e.g. lets say a node is in a server in an IBM/US telecoms company based in France, then that server will almost certainly be routing ALL its traffic through the USA and back to itself (or another node in the same company) before sending it on to the next external node. This diversion is NEVER reported as ONLY a single "virtual node ip" is quoted. The only way you can ever tell its been done is by looking at the time delay, however this is also often difficult/impossible to spot because these routes are often the fastest on the internet. OK - I know this goes on for certain because there are internal tools used within these companies to trace the TRUE route and I have seen such servers send their traffic in this manner 24/7 - 365. Having discussed this as "wasted effort" with a network engineer I was told there is a "payment" made somewhere to compensate. At the same time all of this is camouflaged in apparently nice and legitimate reasons for it being that way, but when you pull it apart you see the lie, but you can't PROVE it.
As about 70% of Europe's internet traffic passes through an IBM/US telco's servers then it almost certain that in any one of these Tor node to Tor node connections there is at least one sub-nodes that passes the traffic through the USA, who is the global adversary using Total Traffic Timing Tracking.
You should be able to work the rest out for yourself.

I had been creating/running corporate web sites since the mid 1990's, I hardly think that qualified me as a newbie. Not sure what was the purpose of this remark was.
The web server itself was supposed to be fire walled from the open web (with only Tor access) but a "hole" bug in the firewall's code meant that a "stop access" mode only caused "logging" mode to be initially turned on.
Well with you being such an "experienced" and "savvy" web person I am sure you will know that there's are things called  software "firewalls" out there which give indications of "attacks" and fully log unusual traffic. The one I used included a real-time "allow"/"block" traffic mode with live log and I used that to track and block / delay some accesses. Again I am perplexed, bearing i mind your huge experience that you should even ask this question.
Of course, once again your vast experience will lead you to the conclusion that once alerted to the attacks I used other tools (such as my web server log & a packet sniffer) to see the details of the traffic.
There were many attacks which I am sure you can research on the net yourself. They were mainly aimed at accessing parts of the server such as files and various rpc O/S components.
They did focus on trying to identify what web server I was using, I believe there were about 4 or 5 different
Of course my web server did log the traffic that did get through, these logs are now gone but here's a section from one which I queried someone as to what it was..
I was told the above were attempts to gain access to a web servers management system.
The attacks all fell on stoney ground because none actually guessed the web server I was using before I closed the loophole.

If it was compromised then why would they have hacked the web server in that manner and with such inaccuracy?
Well, as I said, I tested the web pages for leakage. There was none.
Perhaps they though I'd have no firewall and no logs.
Yes there are scanners, these were already blocked, but the web server only went on-line the day the hidden service went in and it went off-line 48 hrs later.
I never saw another such attack, neither before or after that. The attacks stopped just a few days after I shut the service down.
When you consider that Tor hidden services could be used for all manner of mil/intel purposes by any country with an internet connection and a pc, then it begins to make sense.  Its not JUST snooping on Joe public.

Not if you want to tap -
  and insert realtime recognizable timing sequence delays into a packet and/or block traffic.
And besides, I've seen it done and talked to those who set the servers up to do this..
You need to also remember, that to do a "Man In The Middle" attack you need to be in-line not just a tap.
Well of course not, and I never said it did. I was talking about all the internet traffic. To view a single instance of the Tor network traffic you would just need to filter out the client ip's tor traffic, then its network nodes along any single route. And if you insert special timing sequences in the packets from the clients you can identify these along route and at the exit.

Sorry, but I don't see any questions in your original remark, so I don't see how you you expected to get information from it.
I quote..
Welcome to the internet. Have an open web server, and it will get
accessed by scum that tries known vulnerabilities: /memberlist.php,
I expect most people would read your "remark" as talking down to someone.. more of a game of one-up-man-ship and given the tone of your most recent reply probably done to discredit my experience. Poo is a real stinker.
Yes it had been running about 6months without any specific software firewalling but with logging on both the soft firewall and the webserver, during that time, when I was developing a web forum in php. Also the whole system was behind a hardwared (router firmware) firewall, which should not have let it in anyway and thats why I logged very little (if any) internal traffic beforehand. To come home to see dozens of requests from my soft firewall for access to various O/S components and a log of gained access was a shock. This fact worried me for a long while as I immediately re-loaded my router's firmware and all its setting & passwords, but still they got in. Some while later I read of a vulnerability with the routers firmware (no details given, just that it could be hacked from outside) and I upgraded it. Interestingly the web server had been running, logging and all for about a year before this, as it came with the O/S. Not a single EXTERNAL request was ever passed to it in all that time until I started dev. with it.
Don't you use router firmware firewalls? So you wouldn't see this kind of traffic?
I thought the times when nerds spent days looking through router logs fuming at the drones that attpemt to access your system were long gone, no? Sounds like you are living in the past.
My current router doesn't even have a log on it!
Where all logs end up, on the end, in the bin!
Good, because I was only telling someone of my experience just so they could keep safe.
Here's the sequence of event...
Have web server 2 years. no attacks.
Make hidden service
Within 12 hours of going live have seriously large number of attacks
Switch off hidden service and attacks stop a few days later
And somehow they got through a router firewall and a soft firewall !
And then they were looking for "a web-server" 3 / 4 type of web server were searched for.
Thats drupal.org
Oh! why am I NOT surprised....
Yeah you could be right I edited it out when I mailed my expert.
This "Hey prove it" nonsense could go on forever.. and I don't have the Take it of leave it.
  I wouldn't run a Tor hidden service, given the hassle and given the risk, unless I was having problems getting passed my ISP. It makes me laugh to see all these prognostications on sophisticated attacks when the USA can see it all, transparent, as I explained.
Of course, there will be those who spend their time, perhaps paid for by US gov, making asses out of internet users, thats called co-intel  (pros).
