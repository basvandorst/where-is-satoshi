@_subject: [tor-talk] Report of Pervasive Active MiTM Attack Against Hidden 
Has anybody responded to this claim yet?
I don't understand how such an attack would be possible without decrypting
the traffic, unless this is actually a phishing-and-proxy attack and not a
"true" MiTM. (How would an MiTM be able to manipulate traffic from a hidden
service without decrypting the contents? I was under the impression that
http request to hidden services should be end to end encrypted.)
Either way, still worth taking note of.

Hey all!
There's (what looks like) an active Tor phishing operation located at
 (dot) org . I believe this is related to black
market scammer.
They're offering up a slightly old version of the TBB, but I can't find a
list of the old signatures on the Tor website to compare with. Can anybody
diff the files 'torbrowser-install-3.6.1_en-US.exe' to see what's going on
PS - Just signed up for this list - can you PLEASE do something about
mailman emailing me my own password in plaintext upon sign up? JFC..
For the lazy..

I'm just posting this stuff here for analysis and discussion, not because I
need the tech support. But good advice if there were those out there who
fell for this scam.
More technical details from reddit:
"As we all could probably already guess, the exe on this site is
backdoored. It makes a bunch of requests to 162.251.80.25 (
cp-14.webhostbox.net) from port 3841 on your machine. After that, I am
seeing messages sent to 185.15.246.132 (nordns.com). Finally, I'm also
seeing communication to 192.240.104.151.
It looks like the exe may have been packed with the legitimate version of
the installer as well as the malware, so the enduser isn't supposed to
suspect anything."
Figures. Anyway, thought y'all would be interested. Maybe Tor Project folks
could contact the registrar or DNS operator?
