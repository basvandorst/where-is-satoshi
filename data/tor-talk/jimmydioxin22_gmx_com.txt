Hey Folks,
Cryptome has posted the Tor Project 2008 Tax Return available at:
As many know, all US non-profit corporation returns are available upon
request by the public.
Firstly, people need to look through these returns in the same way we
audit code. Looking at funding sources and expenditures is important to
insuring Tor is a useful anonymity tool for years to come.
Secondly, can the Tor project release these returns on the site for the
above purpose? I don't think there needs to be some onerous accounting
process for reporting to the public (ya'll have better things to do
anyways), but these returns would be nice to have in the interest of

The US Government also gets extensive use out of Tor. Law enforcement
uses it for informants etc. As explained on the Tor website, this is
actually a good thing as it makes you more anonymous (are you a fed, a
journalist, somebody looking for porn, etc)

There's a good guide for this which was written around a year ago

As for virtual machines, if an adversary is able to break through a
fully virtualized machine, another level of protection won't do you much.
If you're worried about an attacker with those kind of skills, you're
better setting up a "drop box" which contains a hidden service server
that you can drop in any area that isn't connected to you. Be creative ; )
