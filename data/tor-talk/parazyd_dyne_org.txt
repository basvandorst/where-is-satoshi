@_subject: [tor-talk] Duplicating Tor's DNS requests 
Hello tor-talk!
I'm wondering about duplicating Tor's DNS requests (like, when browsing
a clearnet website) to another place on my machine.
Basically, I'm running dnscap and with iptables or something similar, I
would like to copy the DNS requests so dnscap can see them, but the
important part is that the copied requests do not get through.
In theory this should be possible. In practice, is why I'm asking here :)
Thanks for the help!

Pretty interesting. I'll see what I can do.
Anyway, I would let both clear and Tor traffic out, I just wish to log
Tor's hostname/DNS requests and it seems a tad difficult so far.

With this one I cannot see any domains in the logfile.

Thank you!
I've tried hosting the repositories on git.devuan.org, but it hasn't
performed on-par at that time. I also don't have another place as good
as Github to host everything, along with the bugtracker. In any case, a
plethora of free software projects are hosted on Github, and I don't
really see an issue. All my git commits are signed with gnupg so we have
that going at least.
