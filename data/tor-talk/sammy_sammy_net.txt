@_subject: [or-talk] ABC blocking Tor servers? 
Tried this from the server hosting fusarium...   I got the following
result which appears to confirm your findings:
% wget  --bind-address=72.5.28.193 --12:35:03--             => `landing'
Resolving dynamic.abc.go.com... 199.181.133.159

% diff landing landing.1 | head
< var pagename = "PAGE_LANDING_ERROR_COUNTRY_X";
So, yeah, the first version from fusarium's ip definitely seems to
indicate that that server is specifically blocking tor servers.  The
address which worked for me is in the same netblock as the address
which was denied.

@_subject: satellite delay (was: Re: [or-talk] Re: Win32.Trojan.Agent appear when close Torpark) 
So, you're pretty much right about the satellite thing.  A satellite
in geosynchronous orbit is about 35000km up, so a round trip to the
bird, back to earth, and then back up and down again to the original
source is at least 140,000km, and that's if your going straight up and
down (which you would normally be taking a longer path hitting the
satellite at an angle), and with 300,000km/s being the rough speed of
light, you've got at least a 1s delay after figuring in human reaction
times, etc....
Ever used telnet/ssh over a satellite link?  It feels just about like
the delay you see on satellite news coverage.  Fortunately, it's
pretty rare these days.  Of course, satellites can move a ton of data,
the latency is simply quite high...
Fortunately, land based lines don't have nearly this far to go.  The
circumference of the earth at the equator is about 40000km, and it's
rare your signal would actually have to circle the entire globe.  So,
say 20000km for 1/2way around, and your speed of light delay is down
to a much more comfortable 10's of milliseconds.  (yes, light is
slower in a fiber than in a vacuum, but, still 1/10 second wouldn't
be too bad).
And the critical part of this is that it all only affects latency.
The total number of bits being pushed isn't inherently restricted by
distance (though in reality, signal attenuation, etc does play a part
in limiting total bandwidth), which is why actually moving bulk data
can still be fairly zippy.
Hope my little "Signal Propegation 101" there was at all helpful.   I
also hope it's actually correct.  :)

@_subject: [or-talk] tor server behind smoothwall 
I'm just guessing here, as I don't run my Tor server behind an external firewall, but...  If the smoothwall, like some firewalls, is doing some sort of NAT out the outgoing IP address, you may be adveritsing an incorrect IP address for your server.  This wouldn't be as likely to affect WWW servers, where you publish the address yourself (e.g. through DNS) as it would be for Tor, which publishes it's own address.
I'd take a look at the Address line in your torrc, which may need to reflect the address of the smoothwall, rather than the internal address of your machine.
Again, this is just a guess, your configuration my be completely Good luck... :)

@_subject: Tor server web page? 
I know I've seen this discussed on here, and it's pretty much just a
FAQ at this point, but somehow my google skills are failing me...
Does anyone have a link to some example text to reply to HTTP queries
for the / page of an ip which runs *only* a tor exit server? (
Something along the lines of "Any traffic you've seen from this IP was
generated by a tor server.  there is nothing to see here."

@_subject: [or-talk] Tor Server Affecting Net Access 
First note -- I've noticed that the IP I'm using for my exit node is
defintely blocked some places.  I've not noticed any effects on the
other IP's, so it doesn't look like anyone is going through the
insanity of knocking out whole subnets yet, but...   Anyway, I'm assuming people are simply blocking all servers in the TOR
directory listing...  Or have people observed that non-exit nodes are
actually not being blocked?  (my point here being that you should
probably consider the additional static IP anyway...)
The IP address probably won't help your bandwidth issue though.  You
could try turning down your bandwidth rate from 75KB and see if ths
helps, but that "should" be sufficiently low to keep things from
grinding to a halt (I personally noticed that I could run apps like
bittorrent at 80+% of my home bandwidth without killing online games
and VoIP).   I'll admit the possibility that the max connections per
second issue is a problem for a home gateway... but my exit server is
on a fairly low-power machine (Linux/UltraSPARC 300mhz box), which is
actually comparable to some home routers these days in sheer MIPS. Call me paranoid, but I'd actually be a little concerned about
upstream traffic shaping from your ISP if they're trying to throttle
back file sharers at the like.
Ok, probably not a helpful message for troubleshooting, just my own
