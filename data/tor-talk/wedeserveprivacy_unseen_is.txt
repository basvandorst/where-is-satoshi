@_subject: [tor-talk] I have a quick question about security of tor with 3 
Third time I have sent this now. Never had to jump thru so many hoops and subscribe and confirm things to send someone a simple email before...
My question goes like this. How is tor safe sufficiently with 3 only nodes during your connection using it? I found a method of using tor through another tor but I find information both on forums and your trac log that this may not be secure and you are going to block this feature in future???
Please can you explain to me how tor is secure using only 3 nodes? Also if users can do anything to add protection with this?

I am not sure how this all works, but I am attempting to reply in the same vein I started.
How can I set the number of relays in the configuration file? Also can you explain why 3 is enough? I hear things of analysis being able to track people trough the various relays they use. This worries me some. Care to help me understand?

I do not get emails. I have to keep checking this archive page. I try and click the link but tor browser will'nt let my computer load up the e-mail client. I had to try and get the link to a different firefox for it to run. This is not easy to use. A normal user would be hopeless with this system. Can you please explain how to increase the settings from 3 relays to 4 in the config? thanks

@_subject: [tor-talk] To run tor browser on main system or this idea instead. 
Which is most better, to run the tor browser bundle on your real computer which has internet its self,or to run tor on your real system and use default fire fox inside a linux virtual computer and set the proxys to your tor running on the network (your real computer)? This in my theory will make the best protection because the virtual computer can be made to only network with the host real one which means the linux has no internet of its own. Does'nt this mean you can safelhy use all plugins and extensions? Do everything on this linux in safety??
Please, I would like to have a discussion relating to this idea.

Surely this is not as simple as that which you said. Why have even a middle node if it is only the first and last nodes that count? I cannot believe this is a simple thing of the first and last nodes giving people up.
