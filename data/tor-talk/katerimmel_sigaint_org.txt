@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor doesn't connect over a proxy 
I'm trying to connect Tor over a proxy in Qubes. In proxy machine I have a
proxy software (JonDo) while in the AppVM I have installed Tor. In torrc I
have setup as socks5 "ip of proxyVM" and as port "4001" (JonDo port) but
Tor bootstrap always stops at 80%, showing this:
"Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 80%:Connecting to the Tor network. (No     route to host; NOROUTE; count 3; recommendation warn; host
A705AD4591E7B4708FA2CAC3D53E81962F3E6F6 at 46.166.170.5:443
2 connection have failed
2 connection died in state connect()ing with SSL state (No SSL subject)
The connection to the SOCKS5 proxy server at "ipVM":4001 just failed. Make
sure that the proxy server is up and running"
I tried to setup before in whonix but without result
Thank you

Thank you for your reply
I want setup jondo before Tor
Vpn-->JonDo-->sys-whonix-->anonwhonix (vpn and Jondo in the same proxyVM)
I use tor to navigate but I would use JonDo for a more long chain (in this
case JonDo see only tor traffic)

About this, isn't enough to buy service over tor and use bitcoin that come
from another source?

With Qubes there isn't much difference, while with kvm or virtualbox I
noticed it. Don't you protect your ISP from Tor usage?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor entry and exit nodes 
This is a question related to design of Tor
If an adversary (government) have in their hands some exit nodes(ex:logs
from a VPN) can identify the entry node and then the ip of the pc
Thank you

@_subject: [tor-talk] Proxy before Tor in Qubes: Tor bootstrap stops at 80% 
In Qubes I modified /etc/tor/torrc adding this line in the file (I want
that Tor read the proxy software that I installed in the VM connected):
Socks5Proxy "ip of VM":"port address of socks"
Is it correct?
Unfortunately I can't connect to Tor, I have also tried to restart manually
In torrc file there are other lines (with  and DisableNetwork 0

Firewall/filter configuration are those of default, firewall of VM is ok
I'm using JonDo ip changer
What do you means about pointing tor at tor?
In torrc I have only a lines DisableNetwork 0, means that tor start
automatically, the rest are comments
Debugging shows me that results are all OK until Tor socksport reachability

Done some changes
Added in torrc
Socks5Proxy ipVM:Jondo port
ReachableAddresses ipVM:Jondo port
Changes in firewall (tor relay setting)
GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_OR_PORT=jondo port
OR_PORT=jondo port
First time I changed just or port and tor connected, shutdown and restart
but didn't work anymore
"Tor bootstrap result
(tor circuit not established)
Then I changed also gateway allow..... but stops always to 80%

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't load Tor browser pages with socks5 program 
I use Jondo ip changer to use socks5 in Tor browser but after changed the
port to 4001 (socks5) and tested in terminal (I use whonix) that my ip is
jondo exit address, when I search something in bar address appear
3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/html/ and "Unable to connect...."
Do I have to make other changes?
