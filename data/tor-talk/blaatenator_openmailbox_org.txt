@_subject: [tor-talk] hardware recommendations 
Hi all,
The talk of Jacob at DebConf (especially the Citizen Four Q&A) got me
thinking about hardware. I know that hardware rng's are suspect, and
probably AES cpu extensions as well. And if Lenovo openly puts stuff in
the BIOS, who knows what else might be in there. Also someone there
mentioned ARM cpu's might be a better bet regarding backdoors (but what
is that opinion based on?).
There was a mention of a 'sort of' open source smart card product and a
certain type of laptop brand (but I didn't catch the names unfortunately).
Are there more recommendations regarding this sort of stuff? Like a
'best buy' guide for secure hardware, or ways to work around insecure

Indeed, some (coincidentally???) big corps do block relays. For a while
I ran a relay from my home connection and for instance Nike was not
reachable without the use of a VPN (I don't mind, and even favor, Nike
being out of the picture, not everyone feels the same way ;) ).
