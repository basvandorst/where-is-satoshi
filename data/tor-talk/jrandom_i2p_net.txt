Hi y'all,
I don't know if anyone is using Azureus to BT anonymously over TOR
still, but if you are, you should hold off for the time being as
there are bugs allowing trivial IP compromise.  Anonymous trackers
are not affected from what I can see.
The issue rests with the support for both anonymous and
non-anonymous activity at the same time - if you have one anonymous
client on a swarm and one non-anonymous one, when the anonymous one
gets the non-anonymous one's IP address, it will currently connect
to it directly.
I noticed this while hacking around with their new I2P plugin (which
uses the same socks handling) and have advised the I2P userbase to
hold off until the issue is resolved.  The Azureus developers are on
the case, and seem to think it'll be easy enough to fix, so keep an
ear out to the Azureus pages for updates.

Or perhaps "until the performance characteristics are sufficient, all
security aspects are both in flux and irrelevent", and as long as that
is the case, in my view rigorous documentation and security review is
futile, given the size of I2P's development team.
Of course, during revamps and redesigns (such as trying to work around
the packet counting problems Tor has [1]), I've written up small
descriptive docs for the relevent bits [2][3][4][5].  Most of the design
discussion occurs on IRC, summarized in the weekly status notes, and
reviewed or expanded upon during our weekly development meetings [6].
(if you had followed the development of I2P in the last year, you'd see
that we've been doing anything but adding complexity - instead, we've been
stripping out and simplifying components for the transport and netdb
[directory].  lately though, most of the work has been aimed at one of the
I2P and Tor share some goals, and over the last 3-4 years the I2P network
has come closer to Tor and the Tor network has come closer to I2P.  Still,
I'm not recommending people use I2P as a replacement for Tor, or even
necessary use I2P at all, but we are using what we feel are sound engineering
techniques to move I2P forward, even if you may happen to disagree with one
or more of the choices we have made.
Of course, if you are interested in more details, I'm always glad to discuss them [7]
