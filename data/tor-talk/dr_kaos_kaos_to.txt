@_subject: Tor as a component of a cohesive anonymizing OS 
Hash: SHA1
In March, I did a presentation on behalf of kaos.theory security research at Interz0ne IV, on building an "Anonym.OS."
The talk discussed the process of hardening and reconfiguring a host to ensure that all externally-initiated communications are dropped or denied, and that all locally-initiated traffic is encrypted and/or anonymized -- optimally both -- from a machine to its final The idea was to build a portable system that could be introduced to an arbitrary network (hotel broadband, WiFi hotspot, client network, etc.) without leaving any discernible fingerprints or telltale footprints. The talk focused primarily on Linux and BSD systems (incl. Mac OS X), though there was some limited discussion about acomplishing the same goal, to the greatest degree possible, on Windows as well.
Of course, key components in accomplishing this include Tor and Privoxy, so I thought a few folks on the list, who might not have made it to Atlanta for Interz0ne, would be interested in seeing the presentation, now available at the kaos.theory website:
