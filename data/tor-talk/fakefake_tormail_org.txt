@_subject: [tor-talk] some more fake "Tor Browsers" on sourceforge.net 
There are some more fake "Tor Browsers" on sourceforge.net.
- A fake of Mike Perry showing quite some SVN activity on "Tor Browser"
- Not sure about this one...
- Looks legit.
- Mike should remove himself from the  project
where is "admin".
- TorTab is the new "Torbrowser" (fake) based on Vidalia and Dooble Web
- by "perrymikey" (fake)
- "torproject" fake
- "Tor Browser" fake
- The "latest" Privacy and Security Firefox Portable Browser now with TOR
bundle integration!
- "Latest" 2011-01-02.
- Not a fake but should be labeled as obsolete and insecure.
Those fake and insecure projects have some downloads every week. Please
protect all Tor users by fighting those fakes.

Good pointing at this. Gets much too less attention.
You need much less wiretapping orders. Just one. Wiretap the internet
exchange point and get any Tor user.

Bridges make sense if EC2 has enough IP addresses and the censurer doesn't
ban the whole range.
Too many relays give too much power to one host and violate diversity.

I am afraid we one day have to go back to high latency networks.
Unless more clever people study the problem and find solutions.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Turning Tor into a full darknet as backup plan 
What is the plan if exit harassment is one day so strong that there are no
more exit server? Is that a realistic scenario?
As backup plan I suggest to keep the network and to concentrate on .onion.
Server with .onion obviously accept Tor traffic and don't harass Tor
Am I mistaken or isn't .onion a great thing since it saves exit bandwidth?
Duckduckgo is already accessible over www and .onion. We could only hope
that other sites do same.

@_subject: [tor-talk] registration for youtube, 
I wanted to register for youtube. For comments, voting... Youtube wants a
gmail account...
Failed to make a gmail account. Gave them alternate mail, correct
captcha... First thing after registration they want is sms or phone
verification... I have no such thing as anonymous user.
Do you know any free voicemail server for use with Tor and gmail?
Do you know any free sms receiver number for use with Tor and gmail?
Just want to use it... I don't plan to abuse something. I am willing to
solve 1000 captcha or 1000 pictures with cats and dogs. Just give me the
freaking account. Did google finally turn evil and wants to forbid any
anonymous users?
Can anyone help?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Hidden Service Be Removed? 
You think. Not saying it's perfect and security should not be increased,
but no one was ever exposed due to a Tor failure.
1. wikileaks has a lot more financial resources
2. wikileaks has a lot supporters
3. look how some people ended up supporting them
They are constantly in press. Not everyone wants this.
In a lot professions its impossible to host a controversial website. Say
you are a physician, attorney, public servant, officer, just to name a few
examples... And then you want stand up for "more rights for transvestites"
or anything like that. You can't do that, otherwise you loose your daytime
The reason many stuff does not get deleted on clearnet is that there ARE
places where it can not be deleted and because those places go viral.
I never saw plans to remove it.

You dare to speak about the topic with your name attached. Respect man.
Blatantly spoken, blatantly answered.
This a nice idea. I got few questions for you.
How could porn banned people send money to porn industry when they cant
even reach porn websites without circumvention tool? Dont tell me about
btc. If they are too stupid to know about tor know how can they learn to
use btc anonymously.
How does the circumvention stuff make a better world? People are to coward
to kick their government ass for their porn rights. Result they can simply
not wank off so easily. Whats the big deal?
How can satisfying their wanking needs help them fighting for porn rights?
Let them suffer. Let them fight. Do not ease the suffering.

@_subject: [tor-talk] questioning tor circumvention 
Curious... Why help censored people to circumvent? Whats the big deal?
They are lechers. They just add load to the network... Will not host tor
Why give iran countries circumvention with tor?
U.S. army and secret service wants to phone home from iran?
Allow Iranian people to read western news and to allow them communicate to
plan revolt?
