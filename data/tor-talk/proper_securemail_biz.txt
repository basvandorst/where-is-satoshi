- I think guest postings are absolutely crucial.
- "Long time pseudonyms are problematic for many reasons." [1]
- One who is interested
in Tor, is interested in anonymity and abstains more likely from pseudonyms.
- People start getting interested in a forum using the guest accounts. After a while or after they got annoyed by trolls faking their name, they register.
- Most .onion boards allow guest postings. Also the i2p forum allows guest postings.
- You get much more activity.
- Much more one time contributions.
- Wikipedia grew with guest postings.
- If you do it well, you won't run into trouble with spam, just like the examples I stated above.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Designing a secure "Tor box" for safe web browsing? 
Did you ever open a new topic devoted to that topic? If you ask that questions inside another topic it is less likely to get answered. Alternatively you can search the trac, and if it doesn't exist, you can request it as enhancement and see, if they answer "should be already implemented", "not supported", "don't know" or whatever else the answer may be.
Anyway, for this kind of attack, the attacker capabilities (passive/active access to ISPs) are important. Even a single ISP is a risk. The ISP could stop or throttle the web server for
a while and then use it's connection at it's maximum. If he can passively view all the traffic and either the guard node or user is inside the observed network, he can find out something.
Let's look at at a regular cracking kiddy. They can use metasploit and exploit the outdated/flawed server software behind a hidden service. Or even write it's own exploit. If that are all of the attacker's capabilities, then the Tor user is still safe. From there he would still have to exploit Tor. Or alternative, from start, he could also simply ignore all the VM/server software and directly exploit which Tor. Tor inside another system is safer, depending on the thread model.
For an adversary controlled machine, which can only exit traffic through Tor, if Tor can withstand or not, I don't know anyone who has ever researched that yet. After all only a minority uses the "Tor box" approach.

A survey doesn't make much sense either. It's never really representative. Not all people participate and those who are up to something most likely also abstain from it.
Exit node sniffing is also not very effective due to https everywhere and end-to-end encryption for .onion.
Google and perhaps the hidden wiki are in power to do an interesting, but still not representative statistic.

I don't think that's a clean and easy solution. Your tool laying around on some third party server and barely anyone being aware and using it.
Possible solutions:
- As a intermediate fix: Simply change the Windows behavior, not to close Vidalia/Tor when Firefox is terminated. (Like already on Linux and OSX.)
- Add an option to Vidalia "Do not close Vidalia/Tor, when Tor Browser gets terminated".
- Or simply provide two start scripts: start-tor-browser-bundle; start-vidalia-tor.
The two start scripts seem the most easy and clean solution to me. One could (auto)start start-vidalia-tor for relaying (or SocksPort for other applications). And start tor-browser later. Finally close tor-browser and keep Vidalia/Tor running.

No good assumption. Using unix doesn't make you a geek. Ubuntu is one of the most widespread AND newbie friendly distribution. Computers come preinstalled with Ubuntu.

Thanks for hosting an exit relay.
I don't see for what you need polipo or privoxy. They are not supplied by Tor by default anymore and if you are now the only one using them, they can harm your anonymity.
nph-proxy? Reference? Cgi proxy? You don't need that.
Do you know TorBOX already? It's an example setup using the TransparentProxy. You don't have to use it, but it contains a lot information you should know, if you want to go that way.
In any case,
you shouldn't connect to TransparentProxy / TorBOX over insecure networks (=internet). Because the connection between you and the gateway wouldn't be encrypted. (Unless you add OpenVPN to the connection setup, and there are no instructions how to do that yet.)
You are better off, if you do not install the proxy on a remote server. Better use a local transparent proxy. If your client is connected to the proxy by (virtual) wire, it can not jump onto other networks.

It's interesting for Chromium, Firefox (download in the clear), Tor Browser and wget.
Wget Has --ca-certificate  switch, but I don't know how to create the ca file. I read that it's possible to self sign a SSL public key, even if you do not have access to the private key or certificate signing request.
I didn't even archive to get torproject.org's public key. That's what I used.
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect  >/tmp/x.cert </dev/null
But it doesn't contain the begin public key block. I am not sure what to use from that file or if I am on the complete wrong path. If you can help out with it, that'd be great!

4) go back to your Thunderbird/TorBirdy profile and check if you can add your account, which you added over Tor
If it's not working then, it's an issue with TorBidry. If it's working then, it was an issue with misconfiguration Thunderbird.

Here is my torsocks.conf:

local = 127.128.0.0/255.192.0.0
local = 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0
local = 172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0
local = 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
server = 127.0.0.1
server_type = 5
server_port = 9050
default_user = "something"
default_pass = "something"
(Also tested to change the default_...)
And here is what I typed in shell:
export TORSOCKS_USERNAME="zzz"
export TORSOCKS_PASSWORD="zzz"
(Also tested to change it further...)
Exit IP remained the same, when changing default_user/pass or TORSOCKS_USERNAME/PASSWORD.
To narrow down the problem I of course made sure I am using the correct torsocks.conf. (By supplying a wrong server_port =, which of course made it completely defunct as expected.) I also made sure that Tor's feature IsolateSOCKSAuth works, which was the case.
Either I my configuration is wrong or this is a bug in torsocks. Do you have any ideas?

- saves exit bandwidth
- will continue to work even if all exits are shut down
- exit policy/ports do not matter
- more diversity
- more legitimate hidden services
- Tor to Tor encryption is an alternative to SSL root CA's
- maybe: the server's ISP can not find out if the incoming/outgoing traffic is for the domain or from something else, i.e. a filesharing client over Tor
Well, using a hidden service ensures that the server does not know the users IP, unless the user run some bogus setup like vanilla Firefox with Java/Flash. That's not so safe, since people can still connect insecurely using tor2web.
There is some use, see above.
That advice is to stay anonymous. Not everyone has this goal.
While SSL root CA's have been compromised at least twice in past (Comodo, DigiNotar), Tor's .onion have never been impersonated by breaking the encryption. Some argue .onion domains are to short (weak hash) and the encryption keys are to weak as well.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to force redirect each application through separate 
Many applications, such as wget, apt-get, gpg, etc. do not speak socks, are unlikely to speak socks anytime soon, but support http.
Privoxy or polipo are of no help. They provides only one http port, with the one big drawback: all http connections will be presses through the same SocksPort (identity correlation [1]).
torsocks is of no big help either. I think it has been designed, when identity correlation wasn't a big topic. By default torsocks uses /etc/torsocks.conf and also presses all applications started with usewithtor  into the same SocksPort (identity correlation again [1]). To me it also looks like torsocks is practically unmaintained, there is a critical bug open,  IPv6 can leak real IP, no progress for a very long time. [2]
In an ideal world, Tor wouldn't only offer multiple SocksPorts, but also multiple HttpPorts. That's for some reasons, either not going to happen anytime soon. [3]
What other options left, to route, let's say, wget through port 9052, apt-get through SocksPort 9053, gpg through SocksPort 9054 and so on?

Excuse me, if I misunderstood. It doesn't look like anyone done that ever before (and documented that online). And for that reason, it were nice, if you could create two examples.
You suggest tagging the applications by user agent and forward-override? That sounds like a nightmare. I wouldn't know how to find gpg's user agent, other than digging into the source code. And if they decide the change the user agent with the next version of gpg, the function gets broken.
Many polipo config files with separate proxyPort and socksParentProxy instances... Might work. It's still not a very "clean" or "user friendly" solution.
I'd prefer one configuration file, were you can setup multiple listen ports, were each of them, get's redirected to it's own SocksPort.
If there are any other solutions, I am all ears.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Force VirtualBox through Tor on Windows XP Host? 
Short answer:
Not recommend.
Long answer:
You can not simply torify VirtualBox with torsocks or so.
Easiest thing to use two Virtual Machines. One works as a gateway, the other one as the client. The client may only connect to the gateway through a virtual internal wired network. The gateway has two network cards, one for communication with WAN, the other one solely to communicate with the gateway. It's possible to do that using a Transparent Proxy. [1]
Windows is not designed to offer strong privacy/anonymity or to be torified. See Transparent Proxy Leaks. [2]
Even when not using Windows, using a Transparent Proxy does not only have advantages, there are also disadvantages. TorBOX documents these pros/cons. [3]

Imho it's very improbable, that a significant amount of people will be able to do it that way. It's also complicated and error prone (human mistakes).
I am working on an anonymous operating system (TorBOX [1]) and made a modification to torsocks, called uwt [2].
Using uwt breaks down to "sudo ip=127.0.0.1 port=9053 uwt apt-get update" or "ip=127.0.0.1 port=9054 uwt gpg". It's also possible to create wrapper scripts, which do that in an automated way. (Documented under [2].) It's only a hack and a clean solution is much desirable.

- time zone (of virtualized operating system)
- username (of virtualized operating system)
- hostname (of virtualized operating system)
- mac address of virtual machine
- mac address of host (if using bridged networking) or mac address of gateway (if using virtual internal networking)
- virtual disk uuids
- Some information about the real CPU, depends on VM software. There might be options to further hide information about the CPU.
- Installed software packages.

Sorry, I have to update the start page. We don't use TransPort much anymore. Only for user installed applications, misc things, subject to be removed as a whole. Due to the valid criticism of identity correlation we stopped mixing everything into one TransPort.
Most applications are now configured to use SocksPort (Tor Browser...). The ones which only support http, not socks, these are the ones because I created this thread.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Operating system updates / software installation behind 
I was told, to ask this question here. [3]
Tor's transparent proxy feature is at the moment a bit complicated to take advantage off and therefore unpopular. That might change in the future, because a) documentation improves [1]; b) in the future (depending on the outcome of this bug) there might be per-configured, ready-to-use packages; c) you discussed to give TorRouter such a feature  [2] as well.
You ask the user not to use Bittorrent over Tor, as the network can not handle the load.
What about operating system updates behind a Transparent Tor Proxy? The same goes for the installation of legitimate software. No warez. "apt-get install gnome"
The transparent proxy feature is great, it offers to reduce the risk of leaks and offers an anonymous torified operating system. Operating system updates behind Tor are a dilemma. It's several hundred of megabytes.
Once users have an anonymous
torified operating system, they use "apt-get upgrade", they won't bother with offline updates, as they are complicated and possible leaks (creates signature).
So what do you suppose to do with the Transparent Proxy feature? How do you want to solve the operating system update dilemma? Can the Tor network handle the load?
Resolutions possible:
a) Propose a solution.
b) Leave it complicated, a nice addon for power users only.
c) Encourage people to extensively use it.
d) Leave the situation as it is. Tell me, not to release a easy per-configured package for an anonymous torified operating system.
e) Remove the TransPort feature, make it even more complicated to use. So we have to use transsocks again if we really want.
f) Propose more, better solutions.
rransomsaid [3]:
installers are likely to leak information about the software they are trying to update, whether due to malicious design or due to lack of consideration for users' location privacy.
proper: This is the reason why we want to make them over Tor. Those information would stay anonymous. The reason not to do them over Tor is the network load as described above.
rransom said [3]:
proper: I think it is. Solution e) would be handled by Tor Client. If someone were to promote an easy-to-use per-configured anonymous torified operating system, this could (I don't know, that's why I ask here.) overload the network. This someone could be me. I won't do it if you tell me not to do it, because I don't want to kill the network I use. And someone else is probable not up to it. The demand
for such as thing is there, but no one started working on it for years.

If that were not the case... The same traffic over a single http server wouldn't be such as problem?
Why? I see a risk for Tor bandwidth. But what's the risk for anonymity when downloading
updates over Tor? Of course, the downloads have to be verified, Linux and Windows do that by default.
I respect that project very much. It's not a full operating system with transparent proxy. It's a Live CD and it doesn't have persistent storage (yet). Applications are socksified and everything else is dropped. As soon as an attacker gets root, they can find out the users real IP address.
In contrast this is not the case with a torified operating system behind a transparent Tor proxy. Even malware with root would still have to hack the Tor-Gateway. And no applications have to be socksified, all are working out of the box. Only application level
leaks (TorButton for web) apply for both ways.
Therefore TAILS can not be compared with a torified operating system. It's a different approach.

THAT is my question.
I am not concerned about it. In fact operating system updates behind a transparent proxy improve the isolation of the protected system as the system gets never to see it's real IP address. My concern is, that I am going to harm the Tor network, if many people
were to use the transparent proxy (TransPort) feature of Tor. Right now only very few people can make use of. But when that becomes equally easy as downloading, installing and using the Tor Browser Bundle, I am not sure, if that's okay for the network.
That's not possible. Everything behind the transparent proxy, root or regular user, has only two options, use Tor or nothing.

be able to do anything anyway, as UDP traffic is dropped, Tor can not forward it anyway). Automatic updates are disabled. If you know any other background network activity please share.
Time zone is UTC. We recommend (soon) to switch identity before/after manual updating.
If there are remaining issues, please share.
I think I understood what you mean. If the user starts piding or chat with a pseudonym and starts the Tor Browser afterwards,
the exit node may link all that to the same pseudonym. What I don't see here is, how does this affect specially transparent proxying? A user with who uses what most users do, a normal Tor installation with SocksPort and socksified applications, then the same thing may happen.
Feel free to throw some problems. I'll try to find solutions and afterwards I'll create a user friendly howto to handle all that stuff.
Application level leaks are problematic. We have a page which describes many of these problems including with workarounds (we recommend Tor Browser etc.).
You are right. We are unable to review
the source code of all applications for protocol leaks. On the other hand I don't get why this is a problem should be more acute with transparent proxying compared with socksifying.
Anyway, transparent proxying should be still safer then socksifying.
Something like this [1] can not happen with transparent proxying. The transparently proxied operating system does not know it's real external IP, only it's Tor exit IP. And can therefore never leak it's real external IP. (An adversary would have to to break into the transparently proxied operating system and into the transparent Tor proxy afterwards, but that is a different story.)
All other application level leaks may also happen when socksifying applications. When people do not like to socksify, they don't know how or when it's impossible they use torsocks/usewithtor or the leaking [2] windows alternatives. Also here transparent proxying
is not more unsafe. Actually it's safer. DNS / UDP leaks are impossible. Real IP may also not leak, the operating system doesn't have a way to find it out.
No cron jobs for auto updating. Answered above.
Of couse we should not if we can not raid all the drawbacks. I am interested if there will remaining drawbacks after answering and if we can raid them.
Isn't that the current state? What most Tor users do? They download and install Tor,
use one SocksPort and socksify all their applications to use that one SocksPort?
We could recommend to use the non-Torified protected system only for one task (example: hosting a hidden service). And assign different SocksPort to other machines.
That's difficult for many applications. That's why torsocks/usewithtor exists. Dunno if that also counts as socksify for you? So why transparent
proxy has been implemented?

I think we did a good start. It's now much more clear than before with the wiki article transparent proxy. All the issues and (if possible) workarounds we come up here, will also be documented (and possibly fixed).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Obtain real IP behind Tor transparent proxy; 
This is an very interesting and important question. I'd like to see more replies.
There are three ways to torify.
Torified through http/socks-proxy settings and "about:config", certainly not. (DNS leaks depend on "about:config, which malware wouuld not honor.)
Torified through usewithtor? usewithtor ifconfig anyone? I don't know. It's probable a redirector, not a jail.
Torified through TransPort and DnsPort... You can look into our setup. IP-forwarding is disabled, iptables default forward and input is drop, when Tor is disabled, not network connections
are possible. Iptables redirects to TransPort and DnsPort. No leaks possible *.
We have also a sub page TorBOX/LeakTests and all went negative. Additionally, Skype, which is known for it's ability to punch through firewalls was not able to non-torified connections. What I don't like to advertise is, that also Bittorrent doesn't leak the IP (there is an online bittorrent leak tester). I am against Bittorrent but for leak testing it was welcome.
* and here comes the "trick". Our implementation, TorBOX, does not protect against attacks against Tor. That is easy said and it is simple. 1. We don't try to defend against network attacks, the usual things discussed, like a massive amount of evil nodes. We leave that to the Tor developers. If I could help against such attacks, I would help, but I can't. TorBOX is based on Tor. Any successful attacks against Tor, does also work against the transparently
proxyied operating system. This will result in 2. if SocksPort and DnsPort, which TorBOX heavily relies on, can be exploited, then it's also game over.
I haven't found any reference, that there is a "feature" to obtain the users real IP address through either SocksPort or DnsPort. Neither there seams to be no such known bug. If there were such a bug found in the future, which is possible, then we would hope, that the Tor developers fix that bug. We hope that compile time hardening features will be added (bug  and  Additionally we are working on AppArmor profiles.
There are other attacks thinkable, which we can not defend against. For example, if an adversary controls your entry node and has access to the transparently proxied operating system. He can simply use "morse" (5 seconds much traffic, 10 seconds no traffic...) And then observe it's incoming connections. Then it's game
over as well.
IP protocol leaks, like this [1], Skype or Bittorrent are not possible. This already justifies for me to use a "no non-Tor connections possible" approach.
When you go ahead now, and ask in a cracker forum, they probable won't spread a simple method to get the real IP of the transparently proxied operating system. On the other hand, if you run an intelligence service and have 100.000 $ left over, you can announce something like "find a new exploit in Tor's SocksPort and get 10.000 $". Qualified people start looking into it and might find something.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Awareness for identity correlation through circuit 
The users awareness for identity correlation through circuit sharing [0] is almost zero. There should be more clear warnings about it on torproject.org.
People are frequently told to extensively use Google. They do so and will be affected. If you google the term [1] you will see that it has been recommended all the time. The version spread at this time was version 423 or below [2]. It didn't contain any warning that it's for advanced users only and no sentence about identity correlation through circuit sharing. There are so many instructions, howtos and blog posts. Everyone suggest to point all applications they want to torify to 127.0.0.1:9050. Originally a Tor developer brought this to my attention. [3]
Also tails, which is listed on torproject.org, uses only one SocksPort [4] and mixed all activity into the same SocksPort.
How to mitigate identity correlation through circuit sharing?
- do not use DnsPort
- do not use your local DNS resolver (like always recommend), deactivate it while testing
- use an unique SocksPort for all applications you do not want to be liked to one pseudonym
- tell your application to use remote DNS resolution,
- if that is not possible, use a wrapper such as torsocks/usewithtor
- a local DNS resolver who catches all DNS requests and redirects them through Tor will probable also not help, as many applications will share the same exit for those DNS requests
Unfortunately torsocks/usewithtor [5] also seams to have only a single global configuration file /etc/torsocks.conf [6], which means you can use it only for one pseudonym. If you start more then one application through torsocks/usewithtor it may happen that they all share the same circuit/exit. There seams to be no option to redirect each application to a different SocksPort. It would
be nice if there were a feature to tell torsocks/usewithtor which IP:PORT to use trough command line arguments.
[0] If you redirect your (for anonymous use) browser, your mail client, your irc client, etc. to a single SocksPort (standard 127.0.0.1:9050) everything may be routed through the same circuit and exit node. Your real IP remains hidden but (most of) your activity can be correlated to the same pseudonym.

I am delighted that you as one of the original TorVM developers, is answering this thread. If you are still interested in this project, you are invited to join us.
Nothing is closed source. VirtualBox is used as virtualizer. Nowadays VirtualBox is fully Open Source. It was not in past, but now it is. There is a closed source extension package for VirtualBox with stuff like rdp, but that is not required. We use only the Open Source edition which is available for Windows, Linux, etc.
We do. It's secured through an internal network. You confirmed it in a cursory check.
If you see any issues with it, let us know.
Windows and Linux is supported as host operating system.
It's also our goal. We make it as easy as possible.
 TorVM would be renamed
I prefer the name. TorBOX
offers more
than TorVM. I believe it is the more appropriate name. Reasons:
- TorBOX can be run either in virtual machines
- or in a "box" (real hardware, "bare metal" as described in the article)
- and is also "a closed box", in meaning of that the protocol can not leak the IP as it's confined in a "box"

Fortunately they fixed that. Everything, internal, bridged, NAT. All networking is working out of the box in VirtualBox.
Many things became simpler over the years.
confirmed it in a cursory check.
Two things we have to compare here...
For the HowTo / manual setup:
- basic linux/shell knowledge is required
- it's a step by step tutorial, everything is explained
- The most important thing is, to give the Tor-Workstation an internal network and to rename it.
- If that was done right, great. Or if you forget a network card or mess up anything else, no connections will be possible. No leaks. Fail safe.
For the future download version:
- You would have to add from virtual networking to nat or bridged and you would break it. That would be stupid. We can not prevent people form committing suicide.
is misconfigured?
If you choose NAT/bridged for Tor-Workstation by mistake,
- check.torproject.org would show "you are not using Tor"
If you choose internal network or no network I can not think of any other more subtle leaks.
Perhaps if we were to fork VirtualBox (Portable(apps) Edition) and disable the critical configuration buttons, but that looks like a lot of work (patch it, keep sync with upstream).
One idea:
Other ideas welcome...
I though it's better to take over an old project, than starting a new one. Amongst other TorVM/JanusVM and their lack of progress motivated me to start TorBOX.
That would be great!

There are only spots for projects which are already in productive state, i.e. really easy, stable, mature. So highest chance to be listed there is only once the "1-click-installers" are ready.
Another flaw in my logic was to assume that TorVM is an official project because some files are hosted on torproject.org.
And I am not convinced
yet that we will have to hide buttons form Virtual Box. I mean, adding a NAT/bridged adapter to the Tor-Workstation is almost equally stupid like removing the proxy settings in the Tor Browser Bundle.
Actually we do not need the Virtual Box graphical user interface.
The gui is 100% independent from the core. There exists even an alternative php based Virtual Box gui. It should not be so hard to hack it. The php gui might not be suited for our needs, then we also would have to redistribute a web server.
I have not checked it in details, but it looks for me, like we can control Virtual Box only using command line arguments. Then all dangerous buttons are hidden. And the ones who add a nat/bridged network adapter to the Tor-Workstation with the command line, they can not be helped anyway.
it is based of
TorBOX license also shouldn't cause any problems.
Actually I believe it's X11 and since it's hosted on torproject.org, they have also ownership.
Yes, I am frequently monitoring that project. There are a lot similarities.

The FAQ entry is very questionable.
"Disabling JavaScript by default, then allowing a few websites to run scripts, is especially bad for your anonymity: the set of websites which you allow to run scripts is very likely to uniquely identify your browser."
I have to agree, that *theoretically* disabling Javascript is a anonymity set reduction, because probable most TBB users don't leave it enabled.
The problem is, it makes the false assumption, that the Javascript anonymisation in Torbutton is next to perfect. It's far from perfect. There are severe bugs open. If you go on ip-check.info you'll see, that with Javascript enabled, the site can still read how many and which fonts you have installed.
That's one bug I understand. I don't know if there are any other bugs open with such severe implications for browser fingerprinting.
That's way more severe than turning off Javascript at all.
Torproject probable also doesn't know, how many people turn off Javascript. How many people do use TBB? Or are they still using the mainline Firefox and torify like it was proclaimed years ago? Also if you look through some public forums, which discuss Tor, they also often still proclaim to turn off Javascript.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pittsburgh Bombing Threats and Mix-Master 
Tell me if I am wrong, but I think it's not worth to bother with mixmaster, mixmion, remailing, etc. anymore. It's practically dead.
Some remailing systems have been written by high profile people, some of them are now working on Tor.
Due to high latency, remailers are theoretically more secure than low latency Tor. There are too few users, too few servers and too few development. Project mailing lists are empty since years. Tor has much more of everything.
Never looked if it's still up to date, but there is a big wiki page about it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Technical Documentation for the TBB Update Notification 
I know Tor Button fetches  but I couldn't find check.torproject.org within the Tor Button source code.
How Tor Button comes to its decision to display  ?
The script start-only-torbrowser  which does not start Tor/Vidalia is breaking the Update Notification, while I doubt Tor/Vidalia plays a role for the update notification. Do you have an hypothesis why?
Can you explain please, how the TBB update notification mechanism is implemented?

@_subject: [tor-talk] anonymity: bridge users vs. entry guard users 
If I understand correctly, a bridge will be used as the first of three hops.
While users in non-censored areas can will use a certain amount of entry guards, users in censored areas get only three bridges per mail.
The entry guard users are more unlikely to suffer from unstable (goes offline) entry guards and blocking is also no issue. I read, that 80% of all bridges are blocked. Therefore I think it's safe to assume that 2 of 3 bridges, bridgedb gives out to users, are already blocked. And over time probable also that bridge will get blocked and the user has to request new bridges.
That means, that bridge users rotate their first hops more often than entry guard users. Is that true?
If that is true, that also means, that bridge users are sufficiently more vulnerable to attacks, which are circumvented by entry guards?

We like to understand Tor's stream isolation features better. For those who don't know, they will be included in Tor 0.2.3 and are already available in the Tor Alpha 0.2.3. See  for more information on the following flags.
The following questions are simply questions, because for want to understand the features better. No suggestions or criticism.

Could enabling it confuse servers are applications or is it because of performance/bandwidth?

@_subject: [tor-talk] apt-get over tor 
My very first considerations...
I don't think so.
1. Some are documented in the Torify HOWTO. [1]
2. Stale mirror attack. [2]
3. What kind of software you have installed. [2]
TorBOX [3] uses apt-get and completely isolates it (two machines are used and one can only emit traffic through Tor). TorBOX also prevents some other leaks, such as time zone, etc. [7] See it as an example, you can rip off all concerns for your own needs.
Might also be a good idea to switch your circuit when using apt-get, see [5].
Perhaps you don't want to go so far and/or don't want to use multiple machines. In that case you need to do some guesswork and still can get started at the transparent proxy article. [4]

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor 0.2.3 Alpha ready for redistributed projects? 
Is it safe to use the Tor 0.2.3 Alpha in redistributed projects for regular use? (Such as Tails or TorBOX.) Or should the alpha branch only be touched by testers and developers?
Tor Stable is already labeled as "experimental software" and "do not rely on it for strong anonymity". How much worse does it get when using the Tor Alpha? What does Alpha with "more bugs than usual" mean? Does it mean there are just more minor annoyances or real concern for anonymity? Is the Alpha actually a Beta?
Is the added security of Tor 0.2.3 Alpha, with stream isolation feature, worth the "more bugs than usual" or do you really recommend against it?
It doesn't look like  will be closed anytime soon. (No criticism. We are just asking, because we consider distributing Tor 0.2.3 Alpha with TorBOX and depend on your answer.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] email over Tor / anonymity sets vs. source IPs (was: 
As I Tor user, I prefer to use mail servers, who does not spill the source IP. Imho it's a gain in security, if only the mailserver has a better chance for an attack, or if everyone on a list has a better chance for an attack.
Your decision to consider the mail provider an adversary is good. I still recommend to use mail servers which are less likely to attack you.
I were nice, if it were possible to hide Torbirdy and Tor use from mailing lists.
Can you tell more please about these aspects?
What about choosing the language within the account configuration per account?

@_subject: [tor-talk] DNS and DNSSec Questions 
I know OpenDNS and DNSCrypt, but I haven't used the other products.
However, I don't see how they are related to your Tor use?
When you use the Tor Browser Bundle, all your DNS requests will be done over Tor, the Tor exit will do the DNS resolution for you. You really shouldn't mess with that.
If you use any of these products, they *should* (have only experience with OpenDNS) not touch your Tor DNS, unless they are doing some really fancy stuff. You can use such products, if you really must, they *should* only tamper with your non-Tor connections.
No, I've never heard any of these, but wait if others disagree with me. Tor and non-Tor traffic traffic, at the same time, is expected. People have their automatic updaters, instant messengers or even Firefox running next to the Tor Browser Bundle.
Of course, you can get more security by isolating machines. One machine/internet connection exclusively for Tor use and one exclusively for non-Tor use offers some advantages, but that's not expected.
I don't see why it were easily. Did you read [1]?
Being a relay, doesn't prove, you are a Tor user. For example there are Tor servers in the amazon cloud and it's unlikely, the the owner uses the same server as a client.
Please read [2].
Tor does not hide the fact, that you are a Tor user. You can do this to some extend, if you are using bridges, or better private bridges, or even better private obfuscated bridges.
Tor concept for providing anonymity is different, in the set of all Tor users, you look equal. If you were the only user, you were indeed not anonymous, but that's not the case. Perhaps [3] is useful as well.
I read, dunno if it's still valid, I don't find the link, being an relay (or was it an exit?), can also enhance your anonymity, since there is no prove, that it was you, who caused the traffic. There are also some drawback, see [4].
If you scare being a public relay for that reason, please consider hosting a private obfuscated bridge. It's published nowhere, is needed and you decide, whom you give access.
No. They make promises, which they can not held. Research them, you will find negative things. Their encryption is bogus, since the server has the ability to break it. Rather use GPG, which is well designed, since not even the authors can break the encryption.
Thanks for hosting a relay or bridge.

You should look around, if you can find a voice client supporting TCP.
