@_subject: [tor-talk] augmented browsing - "sed inside torbrowser" 
I wonder if there are more interested people out there to include a
"postprocessing" of the HTML code via  *sed*  type search & replace
expressions. A tiny sed copy could be included in the brwoser and a
domainbased list of expressions be given to sed that modifies the html
code(s) according to personal tastes.
   + this allows javascript-free augmented browsing
   + sed is very powerful & a  lot of tutorials are available.
   + sed is rather stable & tested
   - a sed-copy has to sit inside the browser,
   - I am not sure to be able to do this alone: I never coded larger
     projects, my C-knowledge is basic and tor-browser is a
     "sensible object" to start "playing" around :)
Thank you for comments / suggestions. Bernard

Thank you for your answer. I should have mentionoed that I have tried
Greasemonkey some time ago. But it is javascript based. None of the
example-scripts worked on a JS-deactivated firefox.  Am I wrong?
A sed / awk whatsoever is at least as powerful, more secure (code tested
for decades), and easy relatively to use, at least if you want
to browse JS-free.
- How to transform JS-enforcing codes like
   into  on the fly?
  Or codes like [link="[ into - How add a little openstreetmap into eBay or your favourite private
   local ads site that indicate the location of an object to sell?
and so forth. One/two lines of sed suffise in each case. Greasemonkey
seems to need JS activated (=security hole), and any of the above tasks
takes 30 lines of code.
Privoxy did the job, but it is nowadays useless since not really SSL
compatible. Somehow the "local postprocessing proxy" must sit inside the
browser. I still appreciate any help / comment!
thanks, Bernard
