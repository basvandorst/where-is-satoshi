We aren't talking about the net a source of amusement. It is an
essential means for news, information, communication and political
speech. Consider what some people use Tor for. As it is, access in the
US is controlled by a few powerful telecoms, and if one of them
arbitrarily decides to preclude Tor or other anonymity programs, it will
have wide effects.
I would not use Comcast, wouldn't trust them given their history (e.g.,
BitTorrent). They're under-handed, lying and basically corrupt. To the
OP, consider changing services.

I've been trying to get Tor/Privoxy to work on an openSUSE guest in
VirtualBox. I have the Tor and the Privoxy daemon running, but get and
"internal error" in the Torbutton test, and a 503 error trying to access
a Web page. It's actually working in the factory guest. I don't have a
clue what's different. Firewall is the same, so are the config files. It
also works on the host. Do you have any guess what I'm overlooking?

I'm trying to get Tor working in Firefox/Torbutton on openSUSE 11.2.
There's something about the privoxy settings that it doesn't seem to

"Internal error" is kind of vague. There's nothing in the privoxy log. I

This usually happens when I've been logged onto the site for an hour or

 Are you referring to
the Google cookies that Torbutton uses to avoid having to fill in CAPTCHAs
every time you load a Google page? Those are the same across Torbutton
users, so they won't identify you.   Now that you mention it, I haven't
seen that in a while. Nice feature, I wasn't aware of it.

"The Washington Post reports that the Obama administration is seeking to
make it easier for the FBI to obtain internet records of users without a
court order. If Congress approves the plan, the FBI would be able to
secretly issue a National Security Letter to an internet provider and
obtain who users send email to, the times and dates of e-mails sent and
received, and possibly a log of every website visited. Kevin Bankston of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation said, "Our biggest concern is that an
expanded [National Security Letter] power might be used to obtain Internet
search queries and Web histories detailing every Web site visited and every
file downloaded.""
This makes me wonder, what information could an ISP provide about Internet
activity through Tor? My provider is more trustworthy than most, but this
would give me cause for concern.
