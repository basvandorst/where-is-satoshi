@_subject: [tor-talk] Java not working with tor 
Good day
I tried to use tor at my office which has a proxy and firewall (websense).
the tor browser is working fine except for any Java applications (i.e chat web sites) like below sites
I'm getting a message that Java is not installed, however it's already installed ( Java (TM) 6 update 26 and Java (TM) 6 update 6)
kindly advice
