@_subject: Why is Vidalia trying to launch dwwin.exe? 
Vidalia apparently tried to launch dwwin.exe, which is apparently the name of Microsoft's Doctor Watson error reporting tool.  Does Vidalia utilize Doctor Watson to report errors that occur during its operation?  If so, how much information about the computer on which the error occurs is transmitted?  Moreover, will Doctor Watson necessarily transmit error reports via Tor or could it transmit error reports directly via the affected computer's IP connection?  While these questions are specific to the Vidalia/dwwin situation, they raise the larger policy issue of the arguably lower threshold for "spyware" in anonymized communication systems and how legitimate feedback such as error reporting can be communicated in a manner that won't be considered to be "spyware."
