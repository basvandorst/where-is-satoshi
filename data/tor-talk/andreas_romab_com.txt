@_subject: TBB in a sandbox (osx) 
Hi List!
I've been working with Erinn to sandbox the TBB much like chrome and
ironfox are on osx, but now I think we need some opinions regarding
where to go next.
See this page for more information on what the sandbox is enforcing:
 For those that hate clicking on links;
Issues in need of discussion
    * TBB is not allowed to read the users preferences. This can man the
browser look different than other windows (as it will use the default).
    * No plugins - maybe we(or the user) wants flash etc?
    * Should we allow users to add extensions?
    * Are We allowing cut & paste?
    * Are users allowed to write to disk? where?
    * Only system fonts are allowed ( privacy )
    * Uploading files is tricky if users are not allowed to read any
directory visible in finder
    * Certain operations can trigger NSCF errors, which will be present
in the systemlog. This needs testing
Also, as we need to maintain two different policies (as the Sandbox have
different limitations on 10.5 vs 10.6), there might be some limitations
on what we can accomplish on both platforms.
Obvious things left to be done is to sandbox polipo and tor itself (when
they launch from vidalia).
To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with
unsubscribe or-talk    in the body.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Does tor browser bundle can goes on Mac App Store? 
There are a few reasons that will make it very hard to distribute the
TBB via the Mac appstore.
The first reason being the license, in that apple decides on the license
for the software in the app-store (not 100% sure on the details, maybe
there is a way?)
The second is the app-sandbox. The policy enforced on the application is
declared in /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/application.sb, and while
extremely liberal, isn't really the issue. (oh btw, you have zero
control over the app-sandbox. like it or leave it. ).
if ( tldr; )
like native osx app. will result in many problems, especially with
saving/loading stuff to disk.
When an application is using the mac app-sandbox, it gains it's own
directory in $HOME/Library/Containters/bundle-id
This will be shown to the application as Its home directory. Access to
the users home outside of this is denied by the sandbox, instead the
application must call on pboxd to gain access to users files. (pboxd
then temporarly copies the file to container directory, allowing the app
to work with the file).
This is done automatically if you have a cocoa app and turn the right
knobs in xcode. Firefox is not a native cocoa app, so saving files to
disk will not work. Will mostly result in FF crashing iirc the last time
i played with it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] OSX sandbox available for tbb3 (10.9 only) 
Hi list,
There is now an initial sandboxed tbb3 ready for testing. Currently,
only OSX 10.9 is supported, but making it work all the way down to 10.6
is not unlikely.
Downloads and uploads:
only from your downloads-directory
Stuff not working in this release:
You can get the release here:
The specific 'release' so to speak is available here:
To use the release you will need to have TBB3 somewhere, i tested with
TorBrowserBundle-3.0-beta-1-osx32_en-US.zip. Will probably not work with
older releases.

@_subject: [tor-talk] FYI: TBB Process sandboxing & current mozilla development 
Hi list,
The discussionss about sandboxing TBB, and how to this properly for all
3 major platforms (linux, windows, osx) have been something that we have
wanted to do for quite a while.
However, as mozilla is moving to a multi-process model (like chrome),
sandboxing also becomes a sane alternative for them, and they have the
same target platforms.
Without having tested, simply by reviewing what they intended to do, it
seem like they are well on their way to implement this without hacks
from me (wrapping ff in a huge sandbox).
For those interested, this is the bug to track:
It looks like they are interested in having some of this available
around FF28.
