The IP you're sending to and the IP you're receiving form don't match. The
glibc stub resolver probably trashes these.
Also: tcpdump output is way easier to read. Please include that (if this
doesn't fix the problem).

Actually, the UDP datagram probably never gets received by the stub resolver,
the OS trashes it since no one is listening on it.
