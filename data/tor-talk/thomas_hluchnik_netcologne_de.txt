This is your opinion. Im am not here because of any filesharing. I decided to provide bandwith when I read whats going on in the EU last week.

Maybe you are sitting at the wong horse here.
My question to other members of tor who have tor servers running: why do you do this. What is your intention to give away bandwith for no money?

Exactly this happened to me, too, yesterday. I am running a dedicated host by Strato, providing unused bandwith for tor (nickname baphomet) which is configured as a exit node.
This host is unavail since 9:00 MEST yesterday. The guys at Strato gave me the phone number of a public prosecutor. I spoke with him, and though he wasnt allowed to tell me details by phone, we has some conversation. When I told him that I provide some bandwith for tor he knew about tor and told me that it is NOT FORBIDDEN in germany to do so.
He asked me if it could be possible that my server has been hacked and been Unfortunately I have not yet received any letter from them so I dont know what's the real reason. I think, two things might be: some illegal activities have been made through tor and unfortunately my host was exit node in the "right" moment.
Or, they are searching for hidden services. Perhaps there are nodes within tor that provide content that is unallowed in germany and they start confiscating all tor nodes and search for unallowed content. If so, some more of us will get troubles soon.
My personal opinion: I have no hidden service. I have no unallowed content at my host. It is allowed to run tor in germany. I will go on running a tor node. I tell anybody here to do so, too.

I am not a lawyer but I think they have a contract with you. You paid them money and they have to provide you a host. Very simple. If they shut down your server without any comment they broke the contract. So you can go to judge and force them to fulfill your contract. If they did not even tell you why they shut it down any judge should be on your side (German: "Einstweilige I think they try to go the way of least trouble. Hosting providers get lots of trouble through the police. They just seize the complete servers for months and force the providers to do lots of bureaucracy. This costs money. The problem here is the police. They could make a copy of the hard drives, this would be enough. But they take away the complete hardware. The Hosting Providers think it would be too much trouble to to go to judge against that behaviour. They think it is less trouble to just shutdown the customers host.
It is a question of pressure. Who makes more pressure? The customer or the police? If you force them to fulfill their contract they might start thinking about going to judge preventing police to seize a complete server.

Hi altogether,
today there came out a article in the german newspaper "Spiegel" regarding anonymizing services. They wrote about tor, also in a positive way. So I decided to send them a mail asking them to run one or more tor-nodes. I think this would be good for the tor project when journalists start running tor nodes by themselves. It is one thing only to write about that and another thing to become active within this project. Thats what I wrote (german lang):
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
es freut mich sehr, da? Sie in Ihrem Magazin das tor-Netzwerk positiv erw?hnen, beteilige ich doch mit zwei Knoten an diesem Netzwerk. Das mache ich nicht zuletzt, um Journalisten oder politisch Verfolgten die M?glichkeit zur un?berwachten Kommunikation zu bieten. Eines ist jedoch unabdingbar wichtig: so viel Leute bzw Institutionen wie m?glich sollten sich an diesem Netzwerk beteiligen, indem sie einen tor-Knoten beisteuern. Nach meinem Kenntnisstand betreibt der SPIEGEL zur Zeit noch keine(n) tor-Knoten, was ich sehr schade finde. Bitte ?berlegen Sie sich, sich mit einem oder mehreren tor-Knoten an diesem Netzwerk zu beteiligen. Immerhin bietet dieses Netzwerk auch den Journalisten des SPIEGEL interessanteste M?glichkeiten, an staatlicher Zensur vorbei zu kommunizieren.
Mit freundlichen Gr??en

Without such a board a system creates "only" pseudo random numbers. Right now I am very interested in questions regarding crypto and randomness.

The Sun Studio C/C++ compiler has the -xmemalign option, which can be used to adjust the behavior of the UltraSPARC CPU when there are unaligned memory addresses that can be determined at compile time.

@_subject: What about private & Public Keys 
Maybe this subject has already been discussed here.
Given, an attacker succeeds to break into a large number of tornodes and gets a copy of the secret keys from all those nodes. This would increase the chance to decrypt parts of the traffic that goes through the tor network. Am I right?
So would it be of advantage for the to network to change keys from time to time, like one should do with his passwords? Lets say, each month? Would this be of negative impact to the tor net?
What is your opinion?

@_subject: System time in anonymity oriented LiveCDs 
Without understanding details of the tor design, did you mention that tor knows the "real" time? So why dont you let tor set the right time. There could be a torrc setting like "when connecting to tor set system time according what tor says". This would enforce to run tor as root, not as unprivileged user, but this is a Live system, so this might be no problem(?).
Would this be a nice tor extension to help the LiveCD users?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor 0.2.2.34 crashes 
Hello tories,
after reading this mail I started to upgrade my two tor nodes which ran stable for years. I never have seen my tor process disappearing from the process list. Unfortunamtely, after upgrading to 2.2.34 on both nodes tor is crashing within a short time.
I started tor in debug mode sending its debug log into a file. The crash always happens at the same point.

My tor runs in a chrooted environment. Together with tor I upgraded libevent to the latest release (2.0.15).
Any ideas? Where can I start searching the bug?
Thanks for any hint in advance

thanks for your response. Couriously I find no corefile. But I did that nice command:
root# strace -f -o tor.strace.02 /usr/bin/chroot /chroot/tor /bin/tor
The tracefiles have between 7 an 10 mb, with gzip 500-850k. Are you interested in having a look at one?
They end up with these lines:
15811 time(NULL)                        = 1320171090
15811 time(NULL)                        = 1320171090

My opinion: to be honest we all assume under normal circumstances that a piece
of software is trustworthy until it is proofed that it contains a weakness or
With regard of security the opposite is true: we have to assume a piece of
software to be broken until the opposite can be proofed. And this is the
fundamental error of all closed source software: you cant use it in environments
where security is imperative. Everything else is an illusion. Unfortunately,
most people I know are not aware of this simple law and I work for really large
companies (crowded with thousands of illusionists).
Now I find this software project where security is absolutely imperative. I
understand that the TOR project guys want to have a widespread community of
people working with TOR. So they do support for Windows. But this is like
someone mentined here: like implementing a high security door in a house with no
walls. This is not really true, its more like implementing a high security door
in a wooden barn.
Me personally would never use tor on a Windows host. Currently I am playing with
OpenBSD because even Linux is getting too large for my taste because while
having so much code its more easy to hide something inside.
I was really happy when finding tails. This should be considered as the future
for TOR: it doesnt matter if any DAU (german word for computer beginner) has its
Windows computer full of backdoors and viruses. He just starts from USB or CD
having an acceptable level of security.
So my mind: stop supporting Windows and even stop MacOS. Stop support for ANY
closed source OS. In former years I played with tor on Sparc based hardware
until I got aware that Sun is not willing to publish the sourcecode of its
crypto libraries. This smells funny, isnt it?
If you drop Windows support you have much more time and energy developing save
versions of tails and Whonix and this will improve the reputation of TOR.

I he is willing to put off his wonderful blind-making glasses it is much more likely that he will not stumple even in dangerous terrain but this is no guarantee. You know you can be very prudent while hiking and stumble nevertheless.
After this is clear, would you say "you crazy guy can keep on wearing your silly glasses because there is no guarantee to not stumble when you put them off" ?
Using open source is like putting off the silly blind-making glasses. You have the change to not stumple but no guarantee.
Thats true. Lets found a company selling such hardened CD's. But from a view of our customers: can they trust in us? Will we distribute them with backdoors or not? Maybe we are even members of the NSA? This must be clear since Orwell's book 1984. Security is a relative thing.
I disagree. I personally have my experience since 15 years trying people to convince using PGP/GnuPG, Linux and tor. Most of them are ignorant. They would use none of them even if you would configure everything for them. They are completely ignorant and brain-fucked. Nothing will help except they find their banking account empty one day.
Others are more interested but have no technical background. They were willing to protect themselves but are dependent of experts help. In their eyes WE are the experts and we show them: you can use Windows in a secure way. In effect we are betraying those people inadvertedly.
I think our goal should not be convincing people using Linux in first order. It might be an acceptable scenario that Windows lovers use their Windows by default but when they want privacy they reboot their host into LiveCD or USB mode containing tails or something equal.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Silly question regarding private keys 
Hello all, please help me understanding this:
supposed, the NSA were able to break into a large scale of tor nodes, stealing the tor private server key. At the same time they were able to gather all traffic they can get. Wouldnt this increase the likelihood that data from complete circuits can be decrypted and traced back to the original sender?
Maybe this is paranoid, but this arises the question for me: what would happen when I stop my tor node once a week, throw away my keys and restart tor so that new server keys were generated. So NSA would have to break into my system again, but this would make it harder for NSA agency to decrypt circuits where my host is involved.
What were the disadvantages for the tor network? Would this confuse the tor director in any way?
Would it be able to keep the nickname or would it have to change also?
Would this have effect on the onion address if I had a hidden server?
Please enlighten me regarding these questions

@_subject: [tor-talk] Off topic. What's the extent of the spying 
This is exactly what I ask myself since one or two weeks. First it must be clear that a large amount of tor nodes is located in Germany. Next it must be clear that the biggest IP Exchange is in Frankfurt and that this will be snooped by BND and | or NSA. It is a fact that they work closely together and dont care about german laws. It must be also clear that there should be no technical problem gathering all traffic caused by the tor network. Its just some thousand nodes.
If you were a NSA member: would you NOT try a lot getting as much of these data as you ever can get? Wouldnt you try to make a deal with all your partner organizations getting all data they snoop so you can fit them together? Wouldnt you try to steal as much private onion keys as possible from tor servers in the net? We all have seen the cowardly behaviour of mustly any government in the world regarding the asylum requests of Snowden. If so, which government will refuse collecting tor data and handing them out to the NSA?
I think its time to assume in any tor related security discussion that they can and that they do.
I even ask myself why the tor network is existing at all. If the US wants to get rid of it they just would do. They just would say tho the governments of their cowardly "friends" that this is criminal and all these cowardly governments would shut them down immediately. Because this does not happpen I think two possiblilities are likely:
- They have already broken tor but dont confess, being happy to gather even all traffic from those who believe they would be anonymous in the net.
- They say: OK, we cant get that network under real control but its useful because we can benefit from that, so keep it up accepting that some are able to hide their activities.

Tor is too slow. The better solution will be VPN located around the wold. There are lots of VPN provider all around in the world.

What is your concern when using Truecrypt? Some say the Truecrypt Project has courious licenses, incompatible with the "normal" OSS licenses. This might be a reason not using TrueCrypt. But I have not yet heard that using Truecrypt were a SECURITY risk. So what are the reasons one should not TrueCrypt except the license issues?
BTW: There was a newspaper article in germany some years ago, a police officier was interviewd regarding the "Bundestrojaner". He stated some islamic terrorists who tried blasting a railway have encrypted their hard drive. The german police tried to crack that hard drive but didnt succeed after 2 years. He said that tools like Truecrypt are such strong that there is need to install keylogger, gathering passwords.
So again, is TrueCrypt broken or not?

@_subject: [tor-talk] HS again: Portscan? 
Hello everybody,
have a question. These days, there were discussions about scanning the TOR universum for hidden server which would mean 2^80 possible hidden server. So lets assume they try one specific HS which is existing. How can they determine it's existence? I would guess by trying port 80 and maybe port 443. But what if the HS owner decides to run his service over port 389 for example? For clarification, that's what I mean:
HidenServicePort 389 127.0.0.1:80
This would require using URL with Does this help making a HS more invisible? Would this require a surveiller scanning not only all 2^80 onions but also all 2^16 possible ports?

Hello Paul,
when dear god in heaven decided to construct earth, he implemented the sun in such way, that it shines over the good and the bad ones. Think about that. All criminals can do their bad things with help of the daylight. The sunlight is completely neutral, shining for everybody.
What you are asking for is some kind of sunlight which is shining only for the good ones while the bad ones should be kept in the dark. But that approach is childish and unwise. Technical things are always neutral and can be used in any way. TOR is no exception. Use it for good or for bad things.
You talk about pornography. I talk about hitmen, offering their services by hidden servers.
If god decides to remove the sunlight from earth because there are some people not worth to receive sunlight, do you think this were a good idea?

Bonjour Christian,
it was me, not Paul. I am not talking in myth, I am talking in imaginations and I feel free to use dear god in my pictures. Who can say this is right or wrong? You? Me? Dear god himself? I am free and I am painting my imaginations in my way. You may like it or not.
About good & bad, right & wrong: fell free to discuss this with your murder if he comes cutting your throat and kidnapping your daughter for selling her as sex slave. It's not just TOR which help him doing such, it's also the sun, spending it's light.
TOR isnt bad and TOR isnt good. It's a tool for the wise one and for the foolish.

Hello ja.talk,
if you are a man, then block yourself. The main distinction between men an animals is that animals can't choose, they have to suffer their being as they are. Men have always the choice. and are able to change themselfes.
So don't spread you stupid "I am an asshole". Think about what you want to be: a human or an animal. It's your choice.
Excuse my bad english

You have. You might consider that intelligent services have large amounts of resources. If this is a planned attack from a group of interested people, they are able to do so.
Did you read Harry Potter's stories? Harry was in a comparable situation, don't forget that.
Exactly what Harry's enemies wished, too.
Me too, and I cant justify because I have no background in any way which would enable me giving any kind of justification.
Same mind like from Harry's enemies.
Excuse me, that's completely wrong. It's a pure propaganda lie from Hitler which is falsified for long years meanwhile. Why don't you know that? Is your justification over Jake from the same quality?
For the Kraut's, some links in German language:
Wrong. We have a legal system and a generic rule: someone has to be assumed not guilty until the opposite is proofed. Doing not so is immorality.
