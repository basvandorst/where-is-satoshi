Hello Eugen,
Client as server by default... That would be a bad surprise for dial-up users.

@_subject: Resolving IP address 
Hello or-talk,
This message looks confusing to me
Resolving the IP address? Is that normal?
PS: Where is it appropriate to post bug-reports (if any) -
 or-dev or or-talk?

Hello Oliver,
I don't understand your explanation about the server ip checking but
anyway I use TOR client.

@_subject: same exit node when retrying new circuits? 
Hello or-talk,
Couldn't connect to the site for a long time. Looked at the logs. And
what I see. TOR tries to connect using the same exit node for 10
minutes... I thought that after 'Retrying on a new circuit' it should
change the exit node...
Using tor-0.1.10-alpha on WinXP
PS Does anybody know how to make majordomo send my letters to me
from the mailing list?

@_subject: same exit node when retrying new circuits? 
Hello yGREK,
Yes. I used TrackHostExits. So now it is a little bit understandable.
But anyway it should probably choose another circuit if it can't
connect for so long...

@_subject: strange warning 
Hello or-talk,
Tor 0.1.1.9-alpha (as client)
Several times noticed follwing message :
Though my torrc doesn't contain Pascal in it.
I've added to it only the following lines
Is that warning normal?

@_subject: Firefox through Tor 
Hello Mike,
Why not? It works quite well for me. If the cookie is generated by the
server-side script or is embedded in the page (anyway it comes from
the external world) - it is surely catched by Privoxy. The other way
to get the cookie - if it is generated at the browser-side (Javascript
etc) then Privoxy knows nothing about it ofcourse (but maybe it is
possible to somehow tune the browser to disallow cookies from
Javascripts), and the only way is to block java-scripts by url or
disallow JS fully (for some nasty sites at least).
IMHO - for the limited set of sites which one visits regularly it is quite
easy to configure Privoxy to block ads.

Hello Ringo,
Privoxy is more universal. For example I personally prefer Opera browser.
No. Action files are checked for each request.
And the question is - why Privoxy "is not a reliable privacy tool

Hello Anothony,
I have built it on Win32. You can take it here - Actually I had to edit a code a little to compile.. So use it on your
own risk :) The archives contain only tor.exe and tor_resolve.exe
My GPG key is in attach.

I see the changes I have done to the code already in the SVN (probably
somebody also built it and had to correct the same issues), so I think
now there is no need to post them.

Try it   Looks like torsec injects some JS and/or redirects to adware sites
