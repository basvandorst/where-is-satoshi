pratical examples to configure torrc to use MapAddress and  TrackHostExits.

Oh, thanks Adlesshaven!
It works! But how you make to run two Tor client, and it is possible on
windows? The option MaxCircuitDirtiness 0 worked for me. At each show ip
site it show differents ips! But I need other normal client to use web
browsing , because if not, the sites have problems with cookies(?), or
other things, you know?
