You might instead want to find out what your bandwidth limit is and use the AccountingMax option in your torrc. More info at the FAQ:
 From the tor man page:
"If you have bandwidth cost issues, enabling hibernation is preferable to setting a low bandwidth, since it provides users with a collection of fast servers that are up some of the time, which is more useful than a set of slow servers that are always 'available'."
