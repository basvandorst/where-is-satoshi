@_subject: Blocked by Websense 
I've looked at websense before while using tor and then looking through the logs.  Some of the exit nodes are categorized as proxies, while others arent.  I'm not sure if Websense categorizes based on traffic or its simply over time the websense makers identify exit nodes and categorize them as proxy ip addresses.

@_subject: tor banners? 
Does tor have banners that can be linked on a webpage?
I've not been able to find any reference to tor banners through the or-talk archive or on the eff campaign banners URL.
