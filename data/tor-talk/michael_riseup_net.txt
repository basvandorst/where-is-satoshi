1. what about the logs?
2. I have the following in my iptables.rules to be notified what was blocked
-A INPUT -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: " --log-level 7
3. `netstat -nat |grep :53` or `lsof -i :53` shows listening on port 53 ? 4. Did you try host (dig, nslookup) on the router?
5. Doest `dig  google.com` work?
6. You could also try watch into the DNS traffic with ` tcpdump -vvv -s 0 -l -n port 53`

What's in the logs?
Did you check what does iptables DROP, REJECT?
To check DNS resolving try `dig  google.com`
