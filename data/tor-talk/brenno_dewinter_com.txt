@_subject: Small Sister Privacy Project 
Dear all,
Apologies if this turns out to be off-topic, but I'd say this would be the mailinglist for this e-mail. Two weeks ago I started an open source project called Small Sister. The aim of the project is to make privacytools more user friendly and people more aware of privacy issues. The main trigger for the project is European regulation on Data Retention (storing who's e-mailing whom and who's calling who). One of the key features is setting up an infrastructure for anonymous e-mailing without creating a freehaven for spammers. Without doubt Tor will be one of the key components of this project, since we don't want to reinvent the wheel.
So I want to point you at the project and hope to get useful input or even contact with the folks behind Tor to see how we can intelligently use what is available already. You can find the project at  - Again I don't intend to spam this list.

Well the issue in Europe isn't really the connection with the
mailserver. Due to data retention governments will get access to the
serverlogs of providers. In the Netherlands providers will sent the info
to a central database that stores all the information linked to the
responsible person. So if John Doe connects to his server it is only
interesting in a few cases where the connection started. In most cases
the central database knows who's e-mailing whom. Therefor you need a
different solution. That is why I'm working on the tool to offer an

My name is Brenno de Winter and I once worked on a project dat delivered the outline of such a system:  the software works, but hasn't reached the wanted level of service. But hopefully it helps. I love to help out.
