Ok, then there is a node at your IP, right? Did you set Vidalia to
be a node or just a client?
This statement conflicts with what you stated above.
Could it be that your Tor Button for some reason is not rerouting
Firefox through Tor? But your IP does host an (exit?) Tor node, then
you do appear to exit from the Tor network, even if FF is connects
Consider also that there's a certain lag in the node lists
published on web pages, so if your IP hosted a node 'til 10 minutes
ago, you still appear to exit from a listed node.

Hash: SHA1
Sometimes it happens to me also, with 0.2.1.26. My relay gets
ignored for a few days after a new IP assignment. Sometimes the
problem goes away restarting tor.

Being on a dynamic IP range, I often change IP. I've noticed that it
takes quite a long time to reappear on the lists, more than one day.
So if you came back online yesterdayafternoon, I wouldn't worry 'til
tomorrow at least. A few releases ago it used to be much faster.

Can you see your node on the public lists?

@_subject: BIND down, weird IPs pop up on tor.log 
Hi, something really weird has happened to my tor node.
I was restarting BIND, wich serves as dns in my LAN, on another machine.
Around the same time I found these two lines in /var/log/tor/tor.log:
Mar 22 10:29:18.806 [notice] Your IP address seems to have changed
to 182.219.88.104. Updating.
Mar 22 10:29:18.832 [notice] Your IP address seems to have changed
to 182.219.55.216. Updating.
I wonder where these IPs came from, and how this could be related to
BIND being down at the very moment.
$whois says that those are IPs from Down Under, but I'm almost
exactly at the other side of the world. Moreover, I can't see any
line later on saying that I went back to my real IP.
Everything seems to be working normally.
Thanks a lot.

@_subject: How does TOR deal with mac addresses 
If you want to have a data link, yes. :-)
Probably he even knows your street address. Don't you get billed for
your connection? So why would you worry about him knowing your MAC
address? If you use Tor correctly, he can't figure out what site you
are connecting to, and that's the whole point.

@_subject: BIND down, weird IPs pop up on tor.log 
Thanks downie!
Briefly, I've found out that I have the "weird IPs" in the tor log
each time BIND has some temporary failure. This started happening
when I moved BIND to another pc in my LAN. It never happened when
BIND was running on the same pc as Tor.
I have this line:
Address something.dyndns.org
When my IP really changes, I can see correct entries in the log. The
problem doesn't seem correlated to my real IP changes.
I'm still running 0.2.1.24.
Have I missed it, or there's been no announcement going around for
.25? I can see it now at

Afaik, there's no such law in Italy. Ask them which law it is.
I've been running an exit node for a few years on ngi.it. Never
heard from them. My node has been down for a few weeks for hardware
problems, but I plan to put it back on line soon.
According with  almost any major ISP
in Italy connects some exit node. Kiss Seflow goodbye and be happy. :-)

That's interesting, because it means that running the node away from
home doesn't affect the chance of being harassed at 5 AM. :-(

I think it's something related to the exit node you were using. I've
just tried to access FB through TOR, and it worked.

@_subject: [tor-talk] using TOR without any browser 
Do you mean through an ssh connection to a remote server? In this
case, having Tor running on my local machine and connect.c compiled,
this is the command I use:
~$: ssh remote.server.of.yours -o ProxyCommand="connect -4 -S
localhost:9050 %h %p"
Disclaimer: I use this trick only to connect to my server after my
IP has been banned for entering the wrong password, so I'd recommend
to wait for more qualified opinions about its effectiveness in terms
of anonymization.

I think I don't understand what you need to do. Do you need to logon
to a shell on a remote computer of yours? In this case ssh is the
way to go. Or you just need a proxy for general purposes, or
something else
