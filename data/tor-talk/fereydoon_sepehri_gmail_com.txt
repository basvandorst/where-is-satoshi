Dear Farbod,
It's good to see my people using TOR.
first of all I suggest getting fresh TOR Bridges every other day.
Also you can install TOR on your own Server and have a private bridge.
Best regards,

Dear Farbod,
You can email to this address: "bridges at torproject.org"
and put this line in subject and the body of email: "get transport obfs3"
the ofs3 bridges work reasonably good in Iran.
