@_subject: Geting Started Questions better said as "Help" 
Good morning all,
Please forgive me if this is a stupid question but I am quite new to
operating a Tor server (started this weekend).
I work a lot of hours behind a computer writing documents, designing
operator devices, systems, drives, etc. Most of the software I write
is specific to the programmable logic controller it will run on, for
example RockWell ControlLogix. This is typically in the form of relay
ladder or control block languages. More "real time" type of control
software. The PC is my interface to these specialized computers and I
freely admit I know much more about them than PCs or the networking.
That I leave to my young engineers that were trained on them in
college. I guess I know more about the process and sequencing of the
equipment I write software for rather than the platform (a PC) I use
to write it on. Though I spend so many hours each day behind a flat
panel, my friends tease me that I can't read a paper because it isn't
backlit, I actually am a bit PC illiterate. For me, it is just a tool
and interface into the "real time" world of industrial control
Being a bit concerned about privacy, I have used PGP and the anonymous
remailer system for many years. I have been using Tor and Privoxy with
Firefox as my web browser and JBN2 as my e-mail client. Having taken
advantage of those services  freely provided by others, I feel that I
owe some measure of payback to the rest of the privacy community.
Since I have very little personal time available, I thought running a
Tor server would be a nice way to help payback the community.
Getting the sever up and running was a bit of a challenge. I had
completely forgotten about a wireless router I had put in years ago.
After a great deal of frustration, I received some very kind help and
realized I needed to add port forwarding. I was able to get the server
up and running on Saturday.
Yesterday, I was back at the office and my adult? kids:) were over to
visit. They always like to play on the Internet since I have a cable
connection and neither of them do. When I got home, I realized the
server was shut down. I guess they shut it down not knowing what it
was since I was not running it as a service.
So, I decided to run it as a service to prevent "accidents". At the
same time, JBN will use Tor in the first hop of a remailer connection
if Tor is running out of the same directory as JBN.
So, I reinstalled it to the same directory as JBN, opened up the Exit
Policy a bit and fired it back up as a service. The first thing I
noticed was that the published Exit Policy was not the same as I had intended, even though the router.desc I
received back was the same configuration as I intended. I uninstalled
it as a service and ran it normally and after a couple of hours,
 description matched my intended
Exit Policy. All was well.
At about 3:00 AM I woke up for a trip to the bathroom and was pleased
to see all was well. So, I fired it back up as a service, and got the
router.desc back which matched the configuration as I intended. When I
checked on it this morning, shows that my configuration is nearly the same as what it was when I first
registered it with tor-ops at freehaven.net.
Is this just because I registered it with one fingerprint and the new
configuration as a service has a different fingerprint? Somehow I
think that is the case. I will send a message to them that there has
been a change to the serve fingerprint.
Just wondering if that might be the case or am I doing something

Good morning all again
I just did a refresh and in the time period it took me to write the
first message, my published exit policy and key got changed to the
correct ones. Amazing. I had also sent an e-mail to the ops about the
server fingerprint change.
Thanks all for reading though.

One small question for everyone, I am running Tor as a service on an

Is there any problems doing that? Thanks!!

Chuckle, how about making the list of Tor servers a hidden service
only available to registered and active Tor server operators? :)
The old saying, if you can't beat them, join them?
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
Or, only list the country of the server and not the IP address.  Seems
to me, I would only be interested in the country the server was
operating from if I wanted to route through all foreign servers.

Seriously this time, could the cached-directory be encrypted to a

For those wishing to use foreign Tor servers, provide a simple text
file of the server nickname and country. The Tor client could then be
pointed at the server nicknames.

 Rats!!! On the bright side, traffic through my server has been up. I
 hate wasting $40 a month on a Comcast connection that I am rarely
 home to use. At least now I get some service for the money.
 An odd thing happened to me when I returned home from an out of town
 job site. The Internet connection to Comcast was dead. My wife
 mentioned it to me when I got home. I tried a system restore to the
 last good point I knew the Tor server was working. That didn't help.
 I pulled the power cord to the Comcast modem for a minute or so and
 everything was fine again. I don't recall that happening before
 except when Comcast was installing new services. I hope it was just a
 fluke or some change on Comcast's end.
 I'll be in town for a few days so at least I can watch it.

Hello all,
  First, my warmest regards to those that helped me get a server up
  and running.
  Sorry to ask some probably very dumb questions. Please forgive me
  for my naivety. I am by no means a computer expert. For me, a PC is
  just a tool to accomplish something like writing a document,
  programming a process controller (PLC), E-mail, etc.
  Just wondering what the meaning and terms are for my server as shown
  at:   uptime 222195
  I suppose that means how long the server has been up. I don't
  understand the units of measurement.
  bandwidth 2097152 5242880 119386
  Could someone please explain what the 3 numbers mean? I know what
  bandwidth is but don't understand the measurement.
  opt write-history 2005-08-14 20:26:52 (900 s) 29722622, etc, etc.
  opt read-history  2005-08-14 20:26:52 (900 s) 22469916, etc, etc.
  Here, I haven't the foggiest clue as to what that means.
  Again, I apologize if the questions I have were answered somewhere
  else. I did a search of the FAQ (TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ - Noreply
  Wiki)for each of the terms but found no explanations.

Hello or-talk,
  Roger said "Find more volunteers"
  Well, you are going to have a tough time finding them.
  I am out. I'll have no more part in this project. Unsuspectingly I operated
  a Tor node with the default settings. I thought I was doing a "good"
  thing. I was acting in good faith.
  Then I found out my IP was blacklisted or whatever that means because
  someone misused the service.
  Then I was publicly criticized in APAS because I had a DHCP instead of
  several static addresses, like one for Tor, and one for the re-mailer.
  Your instructions say a Dynamic address is fine. So why does Alex D Joode
  criticize me? In public? I followed your instructions to the T!!!!
  I thought it was a good thing, now I realize I was wrong. I will have to
  encourage any potential volunteers to think twice. Apparently you must
  have a couple of static IP addresses to partake. At some point, it is not
  worth the effort. I now decline to participate. Public humiliation is not
  worth it.
  And Alex, your blacklisted on my re-mailer. So were even!!!!

Thanks Sam,
I only have the single IP too. My problem is I wanted to make a PC dedicated
to Tor and the re-mailer system. I was running some test e-mails and my IP
was blocked by some organization. (The message is on the other computer).
I was reported by one person and blacklisted. The topics of the messages
showed up as "Testing Sockscap 4", "Testing Sockscap 5", something like that.
It gave my port number so I knew it was out of Tor.
The big problem is that to run a re-mailer, you have to be able to
communicate with other re-mailers. If they are using blocking lists, I could
be a middleman in a chain and the message by someone wouldn't get through.
That shakes the reliability of the entire network.
The worst part is, the remailer that blocked me is operating a type 3
remailer in addition to type 2. Both Roger and Peter have contributed to the
design of that network. So here is an interesting result. I am going to set
up a type 3 remailer but I won't be reliably able to communicate with some
other type 3 remailers since I was a Tor exit node and got blacklisted by a
few of the many organizations out there.
I'll have to find a way to automatically not chain through those other
When I start Tor back up, it will be middle only.

I think it is the same IP I have had for the last year and a half. I'll give

Only 2 re-mailers have me blocked. Apparently while I operated as an exit
node, someone abused the service and got my IP blacklisted. Only 2
re-mailers are using black list filtering. That is not very good if I am
a middleman of a chain. Someone's mail won't go through :(
One of the 2 re-mailers that has me blocked is also a Tor node operator. I just

I do have a cable modem. I also have another router that's been sitting in
the study. When I had it installed, I had the cable modem and router hooked
up and turned on at the same time. Could be either I guess. Wonder if I
changed out the cable modem? It has frozen up on me a few times with heavy

No, far too slow for spam. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Normally
it can take 30 minutes to a couple of hours for a message to go through.
Definitely not a spam network. Besides, the messages have to be formatted
before they can even get in to the re-mailer network. That requires keeping
up with re-mailer keys, encryption to the re-mailers before sending and the
software itself looks at the message MD5 and if it sees 2 or more message bodies
that are identical, it will discard all but one. It is also all plain text
messaging, no pictures of Rolexes and sizes are limited. I tried it my self
on my re-mailer. I changed the subject but left the body the same. When it
hit the re-mailer software 7 out of 8 test messages were deleted.

Yes, I sent off an e-mail. Hopefully he will understand. After all, all we

Last night and this morning, I did some checking around. I am using Comcast
as my ISP. I did a search and found the following site:
Basically Comcast uses DHCP leases. The lease is good for 4 days at a time.
I opened up my router last night and sure enough, that is what it showed. I
hit the reset button on the router and it returned that I had a 1 hour
lease. So I shut off the modem and the router.
I tried putting in the other router this morning but couldn't get it to
connect. Same type of router, a Netgear wireless but the slower version so
the menu was the same. After trying to get it going for a while, I had to
give up. When I put the old router back in, I got the same IP back. So
apparently the lease didn't expire or is somehow tied to either the modem,
the router, or me as a customer.
Interesting was a comment I found on the page I listed above. The following
is a quote:
I've been a ATTBI/Comcast sub for 3.5 years. My IP has only changed 3 times.
"Once with a new installed router (MAC change), the second when they switched
me from the ATTBI servers to the Comcast servers, and when I upgraded my
router to a WRT54GS last summer."
Seems to me that a router change may be an answer. I need a new one anyway
since I have one of the very first Netgear routers released. I think I read
some of the newer ones have better encryption features. We were using the
same type Netgear router here at the office but it caused a lot of dropped
connections so we upgraded it to a newer different model. A Linksys. That
stopped the dropped connections.
A second real possibility is the MAC  address of the modem. That may be a
little more complicated to setup. Some additional reading showed that to get
the service to work, Comcast needs the MAC address of the modem.
Hmmmmm, maybe I'll send one more letter out and ask the other re-mailer to
unblock my IP. I Have not heard back from the first yet.
I might give that all go and and do some shopping this afternoon.
Thanks for all your tips. Maybe I'll get lucky.
PS, anybody know how to get off these lists?

Well, I am an unfortunate victim of vandalism done through my Tor Exit Node.
Have a look at:
Notice the the sentence toward the bottom line of the page:
"You will not be removed from the database without a donation to a
charity/good cause for the time spent reading and dealing with the
Right!! and offering up free bandwidth as a Tor Exit node isn't charity?
Needless to say I am teed off about it.
Sorry, I had to vent. I have spent several hundred dollars on a new cable
modem router (different MAC address) and am off of the Internet at home for
4 days at least until the DHCP lease expires.  Comcast uses 4 day DHCP
Hopefully, after 4 days, I'll install the new modem and go through the
hassle of setting it up with Comcast. I know it will be more hours wasted.
What if I get the same darn IP back?  I hate these blacklisting outfits.
I feel like suing them. I have the financial resources to do it too.
The statement about contributing to charity is extortion. The company I own
and founded spends in excess of $15,000 a year on charity. The boy scouts
get nearly $5,000. Then there is all the others. Community days, though I
don't live in this community, awww hell, I can't even think of everyone we
give to. In reality, that $15,000 comes out of my pocket in the end.
Then there is the personal donations to our church, every school kid selling
candy bars, supporting the High School Cagers club, you name it.
Sorry all, just mad at the blacklisters and abusers.
