I subscribe to a vpn service, can tor run with this service on, or should I not get tor, or what?

Will using a APN service and TOR together hide my ISP and my browsing activity from all, or just use one of them?

Thanks, but my original question was can I use tor if I pay for a VPN service?
I wouldn't touch your IP range a single time. I'd just set up a lot of
DNS to point there, and have lots of pages point to those domains. Then
the googlebot whould try to fetch all the 404 pages, and get blocked.
It doesn't. It's designed for a different problem set.
Problem is, no one really can tell.
I spoke of the 'for days'. I don't see why blocking the script kiddie
again for an hour when he reappears wouldn't equally help.
Just think what would happen if you did. (I got that idea watching the
sustained and stuipd ssh login attacks.)
Seriously, what kind of 404 page do you have that can't handle requests
at line speed?
No; if you can't figure out what's funny about the suggestion, I won't
go explain the joke (further).

For some reason this didn't post the first time.  Trying again.
Perhaps it is not so much a matter of rudeness as not realizing that is
what that link is there for.  Tor moved beyond the technical crowd only
a long time ago.
Suggestion for the mailing list administrator:
Perhaps the link to the list could be preceded by the words
"To unsubscribe or change your subscription options please visit:"
or similar.
BTW, I just visited that page and I had to look several times before I
spotted the unsubscribe option.  My eyes were not immediately drawn to it.

Hi Maimun,
this is a fine question.
Actually, what you find on metrics.torproject.org *is* the estimated
average number of Tor users per day, not the total number.
Here's how we calculate those numbers (simplified): we sum up daily
requests by Tor clients to the Tor directories to fetch the network
status document, assume that an average user makes 10 such requests per
day (some make just 1 or 2, others 15 or 20), divide the number of
requests by 10, and have our estimated average daily user number.
But we don't have data to say whether two requests were made by the same
client or two different clients, mostly because clients can send their
requests to hundreds of directories which cannot exchange data on
requesting clients for obvious privacy reasons.  That's why we cannot
calculate total users per day, just averages.
For more details, see these reports:
I wonder, why did you think metrics.torproject.org shows total users per
day, and how can we make it clearer that these are in fact daily averages?
