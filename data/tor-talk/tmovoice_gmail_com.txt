Cheating is always easier.  What about discouraging the number of exit
routers and salting the network with compromised servers?  That could and
probably already has been done.. So cracking tor becomes relatively trivial
from a government standpoint should they decide it is needed.
Now about message content, one must consider that the job of the NSA must
include designing secure systems for friendly side communications.  If you
are really being honest
with yourself, the modern weapons of today's world are the sphere of
nations not hardly an Individual.  You best bet is common sense.  Even
though you might desire some privacy
damn little is available to you so just get over it. Ever tried to rent a
motel room without an I.D.  Even all the latest James bond movies, the
other guy always knows who he is.  And about half of them knows what he is
up to.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Removing viruses from the BIOS Chip to Vladimir and 
What the guy was talking about was to use your own custom loadable driver
to handle access to Interrupts 21 and 9.  There are drivers already in
place in the bios that normally handle this function.  At the hardware
level in the bios though if these routines happen to be malware then any
use of the keyboard can be monitored through Int 21h and any access to
hardware, like disk drive access ect could also be interfered with.  If
every bios and computer is rigged then there is no escape except to rewrite
those routines and check on a regular basis so that they don't get replaced
by the built in ones.  Some types of malware have built in defenses.  As
far as ANT goes the Idea has been around for a long time.  I have noticed
that even with network sharing specifically disabled some stuff would crawl
around in the network from box to box and you had to swat them one at a
time with all other boxes disconnected until you cleaned them all.  I knew
one guy who found the stuff hidden in the printer character memory.  The
company replaced all their computers with new ones and of course still had
expletives coming from their printers.  A former employee had his revenge.
Another software developer from another company had gotten gypped out of
payment for his work.  You have no Idea what that cost them and their
customers.  Now we call such software windows and pay for "upgrades" that
are as defective as their predecessors. Xp was found to have a class ID
named NSAkey buried deep in it's code..  Now I wonder what that could be
for?  Windows is hopeless.  Old Motorola 68000 based Amigas and Macs might
be ok.

That 800 number of users was years ago at a very very early beta stage,
which means that Tor has had attention drawn to it by some fairly
intelligent people for a very long time.  Just using it may give you .
 some extra attention.  The only "trick" that only works some of the time
is to stay legal except that area seems to also be somewhat malleable with
invisible edges.  You buys your ticket you takes your chances and your
mileage may vary.  We live in interesting times.

Tor was broken in beta long before it mainstream.  What would you day if I
said there was a list of every tor user and relay and that list was started
when there were as few as 800 users???  Saw the list way back when.  the
government is willing to spend 7.55 billion to get into our shorts at the
What makes you think they wouldn't spend a couple million to make a bunch
of tor relays that don't  play by the rules and swamp the system with a
bunch of Tor Spybot relays?  Who needs vulnerabilities.

Dross my ass it's true.  I kept getting pinged when running Tor right when
ir was first in beta.  My firewall was set not to respond to pings.  I
could register where they were coming from
.  So I did a back trace and it led me to a machine at Harvard.edu. Ftped
straight in and a few levels up was the list of 800 Tor users.  Where does
grant money come from for computer science projects? Figure it out.  It's
too easy for you I know.

Been there done that. The Idea was so cool that when the company I worked
for needed a little help reducing the prototype down to a single circuit
board and their result came back, "made in japan"  they settled out of
court for $1,000,000.
The contract stipulated that all finished products were to be made in the
USA.  The trouble was started by the company trying to cover the products
origins up.  The argument was ended by The department of defense criminal
fraud division.  Total production run was 6 boards plus spares.

What if the majority of the relays or even a large fraction are not playing
by those rules?  Why not 4 or 5 hops?  Will too much traffic will over
burden the network and slow it down?

Well, It is possible that particular project was ended on that particular
machine.  I left after seeing the list.  Some one who left the front door
wide open might not like regular visitors and complain about it.  I might
have a backup of the eight hundred laying around though.  I think they were
only counting relays.  I also don't know why but every time I started Tor
it got pinged on a regular basis.  As a bare minimum I would suggest always
using tails so you at least have a chance of starting with a clean  OS.
Applebaum who knows more than most about Tor's Innards than most is
concerned about exploits that can be implemented.
and this is old very old

the scope of the NSA and GCHQ?s surveillance and information warfare

It?s fairly long, and somewhat technical, but in short, every paranoid
fantasy that we in the IT security world have had, appears to be true, and *it
gets much much worse?"*
