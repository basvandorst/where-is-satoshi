How would one operate as a middleman node?  I want to contribute my
bandwidth, however I don't want to be an exit node, does a middleman
node help much?
So is reject *:* the only that requires for middleman? Do I even have
to set my incoming iptables rules to allow tcp ports 9030 and 9001?

Thanks for the reply :)
So do I have to get my node authorized if I run it as an entry/ middleman node?

How do I browse hidden servers? Like the one on the wiki link from
tor's front page?
I keep getting these errors from mozilla "the proxy server you have
configured could not be found".
While tor works perfectly, when I try to set up a hidden server for my
apache at home, everything seemed fine, untill browsing, I get that
error again.

I don't want to use privoxy, however I'm trying with socat.
The url on tor's page that's supposed to help me setting up so that
can view hidden servers is itself a hidden service 0_0.
And since I can't get to it in the first place how do I view it?

@_subject: What happened? 
I tried it last night and it seemed incredibly slow too.
It might be that I was connected to a slow node.
Just wondering if that has anything relates to the graph.
