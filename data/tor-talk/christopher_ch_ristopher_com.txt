I don't see a difference between regular downloads and operating system
updates.  (I am speaking of Debian here, I don't know how other
operating system or distributions handle package installation and
updates.)  Are regular downloads of 'several hundred of megabytes' not
encouraged by the Tor project?
The point of Bittorrent and Tor is, well, it's really a lot of traffic -
a lot more than just a few hundred megabytes.  On top of that, UDP is
involved and clients leak information due to the protocol design.
If you are concerned that operating system downloads may compromise your
regular Tor online activity you could set up a dedicated tor instance
just for operating system updates.  You can easily do so by separating
traffic at user level (root vs. regular users).  Why do we need a
special package for such a simple task?

As I said, setting up two Tor instances, that is two running tor
processes with different TransPort's, solves that problem.

I'd hotpatch all Winsock functions.  Patch the prologue; do not patch
the IAT - this is not enough!
        Detours are pretty much the easiest and most applicable means to achieve
traffic redirection in user mode.  Unfortunately a hostile application
can easily defeat ordinary detours by bypassing Winsocks or loading its
own copy of the Winsocks dll.
Filter drivers, anyone?
