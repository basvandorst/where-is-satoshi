I started a wiki page to track the ongoing discussions on this list about the status of different email service providers
when it comes to tor friendlyness (mainly during signup).

Dear anonymous wiki editor submitting this change:
Would you mind discussing why you think creating that wiki page is bad idea?
I doubt that email providers in i.e. Germany (and elsewhere) can be ordered to force new accounts to be created only with valid phone numbers (SMS verification).
