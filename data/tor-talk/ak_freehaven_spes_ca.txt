@_subject: how to autostart tor on osx? 
I spent hours on this, several months ago. I never got it to work. Which seemed impossible, really. Like you, I even tried adding a line to the Privoxy script in StartupItems....and Privoxy would start, but Tor would not. I tried running it from a StartupItems script alone on a single line; then mixing with other scripts, then with/out sudo, and then both with/out setuid/gid...I forget what all.
Nothing. Nada.
I intend to try again, but for now, I just go to the 'Accounts' PreferencePane and point directly at the bare 'tor' binary -- by default '/usr/local/bin/tor'. It leaves an ugly TERM window open, but it works, every time. (At one time I made a wrapper script, and pointed at that. But there is nothing I need which can't be done in the default '/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc' config file. YMMV.)
Other problems were placement of 'torrc' and the logfiles....but those are just *nix permissions problems, and can be fixed/setup any way you Looking at the website, I see interest also in a OSX package of MixMinion. I guess I could try doing both, if there were interest? Assuming that this approach is possible -- and it (almost) must be. (Right? )
PS: Do we get copies of our own "sends"? This is my second attempt.

OS: 	Mac OS X v10.3.6
CPU:	G4, with 512MB RAM
1) UNINSTALL
(a) Uninstalled the version of tor already in use (v0.0.9rc3). Ran
'script' before beginning, in case anything of interest:
(b) I had in non-standard dir.
(c) Uninstall seemed to work effectively, albeit with an error re:
Win32, likely irrelevant.
(d) Output of uninstall:

(e) Manually deleted '/Library/StartupItems/Tor'
2) INSTALL
(a) Opened and mounted 'tor.dmg' without problem.
(b) 'ReadMe.rtf' contains stock info, which in release version for OSX
will be poor info:
See the INSTALL file for a quickstart. [...]
(c) D-click 'tor.pkg', select all default buttons, success.
(d) 'ps aux | grep tor' shows no tor process running. No
'/Library/StartupItems/Tor' directory visible. Try a restart to experiment.
3) REBOOT
(a) No auto-launch. 'ps aux | grep tor' shows no running process.
(b) Download and install 'torstartup.zip' from address below. Change foldername to 'Tor' and place into '/Library/StartupItems/'
(c) Reboot. Again, no auto-launch. 'ps aux | grep tor' shows no process. Ran 'ps' as both user and sudo.
(d) Checked installation:
    (i) /usr/local/bin/tor [yes, installed]
    (ii) wkstn:user$ tor   [yes, in path]
wkstn:~ user$ tor         [yes, works for 'user']

Dec 06 00:26:34.438 [notice] circuit_send_next_onion_skin(): Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like it's working.
(e) Once again, nada.
4) GO TO BED
(a) Seems to help the human, anyway.
