Hi there. So a few days ago I joined the list on another alias with my name however I decided it'd be better to use an email address matching my name so I unsubscribed and decided to use this email address with a matching GPG key instead. I am still active on Tor's IRC Channels under the username "deatives" and will continue to do so.

I understand that the chats on that network ARE NOT private. I utilize XMPP+OTR for that (or Signal for friends and family). That being said it's a fun place to hang out and talk about Tor with like minded people.

As previously mentioned I'd recommend putting a 72 hour delay on stats. Also just post some information. Don't be too revealing. Just list the amount of traffic (round the number) and leave it at that.

You make a good point. As Dave said "Is it any different than participating in a public surveilled mailing
list?" I don't see a difference. The NSA can and probably does look at

Is it configured to connect to Tor Browser's "tor" binary or do you have a separate "stand alone" "tor" binary?

What happened to disconnect.me? Did they get acquired? Or are you asking if it's safe? Also just use DuckDuckGo they've improved over the years.
Thank you for reading,
