message-ids and I just subscribed.)
I'm the lucky engineer that owns tlsdate-in-chromeos. We absolutely do use it,
and have been using it since late last year. Our local clone of it is here:
Our integration code is here:
The (slightly outdated now) time-sources design doc is here:
I am happy to answer any questions people have about this.

Did you get a stack trace?
Also, yes, tlsdated is not very well-written. I wrote it in a great hurry and
now don't really have time to undo the worst of the hacks :(. Patches gratefully

In that case, nothing good happens (we don't detect that we now have "real"
network connectivity because the available routes don't change). For Chromium OS
specifically, there is pending work to be done to have the network manager cause
tlsdated to poll for time right away when we escape from a captive portal, but
in general tlsdated doesn't handle this case properly right now.

Even if not, there are other easyish ways to distinguish a Chrome OS device,
such as the autoupdate behavior.
We are supposed to be using it, but are not yet. Open bug :)
