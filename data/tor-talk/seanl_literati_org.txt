RMS is a war general: great to have around for a fledgling movement
constantly under threat of destruction, but a liability after you've won
the war. Werner is right to consider breaking ties with the FSF, but
whichever way things go, I don't think GnuPG is under threat. And even
if it somehow went away, there are alternative implementations such as
NetPGP that have far less restrictive licenses, not to mention actually
being a LIBRARY instead of a monolithic command line tool.
RMS is an extremist and always has been. If anything, the success of the
free software movement has only hardened his views. I think it's a waste
of time to try to get him to negotiate. I say this even as an avid Emacs

@_subject: [tor-talk] M.Hearn adds privacy depriority to Bitcoin XT, 
The feature is very clearly described on the BitcoinXT web site, and you're
mischaracterizing it by saying BitcoinXT downloads the list "for
blacklisting." It is a DoS protection feature that ONLY comes into play
under overload. And yes, BitcoinXT considers Tor connections "less
important" than non-anonymous connections during attacks. You may not agree
that that's a good heuristic, but if that's your problem with it, say so.
"Anti-DoS attack improvements, by Mike Hearn. It's currently possible to
jam a Bitcoin node by connecting to it repeatedly via different IP
addresses, as there is a fixed limit on how many connections a node will
accept. Once full, no other peers or wallets can connect to it any more and
serving capacity for new nodes and P2P wallets is reduced. If the attack is
repeated against every node, the entire network could become jammed.
"This patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise
could not accept new connections. It labels and prioritises connections
according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and
the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make
room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular
IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most
users/merchants don't use it. In normal operation this new code will never
run. If someone performs a DoS attack via Tor, then legitimate Tor users
will get the existing behaviour of being unable to connect, but mobile and
home users will still be able to use the network without disruption."
Please specify how that is "misleading" or "downplaying."

I am fairly sure Freenode allows access through Tor if you are registered
and authenticate with SASL. There might be some additional step required
beyond simple authentication; I recall Tor users complaining about the
requirement. But they may have just been complaining about Javascript or
the need to use a valid email address? Not sure if SSL is required to auth,
but you should really be using it. You need to use port 6697, 7000, or 7070
for SSL.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using SDR 
Radio is being used right now to provide anonymity, but it's being used[1]
to hide endpoints similar to the duct-taped payphone trick depicted in
Hackers, in order to avoid attacks like the one used to capture Ross
Ulbricht without giving him a chance to wipe his computer (they snuck up
behind him and pinned his arms, but they would have just rushed him had
that not been possible). If you use a device like the ProxyHam and you sit
somewhere where you can see it, there's a reasonable chance you'd spot
someone who's trying to find you, giving you a chance to hit your panic
button and escape.
The older, lower-tech version of this trick is to use a high-gain antenna
like the Cantenna or a Yagi to use a public wifi AP from a stealthy,
defensible location. The problem with this is that this presents no
challenge to RDF (radio direction finding) equipment designed for WiFi.
That's the big advantage of the ProxyHam, since whoever is looking for you
probably won't know in advance what frequency you're using. And solving
that problem in a general way requires MUCH more expensive gear than just
locating WiFi clients.
If you're concerned about someone coming after you with much more capable
RDF equipment, you are now talking about LPI (low probability of intercept)
communications. This could be something as simple as a longwave infrared
optical link, which won't show up on regular CCD or CMOS camera even
without an IR filter. With SDR you might use some form of non-sinusoidal
spread spectrum with extremely high processing gain so you'll be well below
the noise floor and your carrier won't be recoverable using autocorrelation
techniques. Some UWB techniques fall into this category, though because
"legal" UWB is required to be confined to a narrower bandwidth, it's
probably detectable.
It MAY be possible to use SDR to achieve LPI while still remaining within
FCC Part 15 just by using very low bitrates relative to the bandwidth
allowed to you by law. There is a minimum energy per bit dictated by the
noise spectral power density (W/Hz) no matter how much processing gain you
have, which means there's only so much wider-bandwidth modulation can do to
prevent you from being noticed as a source within whatever bandwidth you're
using. To go lower, you have to lower your bitrate or use a higher gain
Actually, that gives me an idea: MIMO precoding[2] (versus spatial
multiplexing, which is useless for your purposes). MIMO precoding devolves
to beam-forming in the absence of reflectors like buildings, but in an
urban environment, you get a complex combination of signal paths, with only
a part of the signal following any given path and coming together only in
the vicinity of the other station, but from multiple directions. I would
think that would make RDF extremely difficult without fooling the target
transceiver into talking to the wrong radio. This is state-of-the-art
stuff, though, requiring multiple transceivers, a decent amount of
computing power, and someone with a lot of knowledge in the field. But it
would be a really neat project with a lot of practical applications.
MIMO precoding requires a "training" phase where they discover one another
by transmitting some easily "locked-onto" signal so that each receiver can
find the other transmitter independently. This doesn't have to make them
easier to detect by an outsider, though, even during training: with
synchronized clocks and a secure PRNG, the search space the "friendly"
radio has to search through can be made small, while anyone who doesn't
know the random seed or clock offset would still be stuck trying to use
autocorrelation to find the carriers.
Now that I think of it, though, it's possible that plain ol' direct
sequence spread spectrum using an effectively infinite pseudorandom
sequence and a rake receiver[3] at each end to deal with multipath would
probably be good enough. It won't stop you from being found once your
adversary is close, but multipath should make it hard to track you once the
base station is found. You'd still need to have some way of knowing the
base station has been discovered, though.

@_subject: [tor-talk] hierarchy anonymity 
A naive, probably inefficient approach would be to have everyone tweet
fixed-length encrypted messages encrypted with each of the others' private
keys, including the teacher's, at the same time every day. Everyone would
also download everyone else's tweets and attempt to decrypt all of them.
All but the teacher's message would be random garbage with a broken
signature or message digest. Provided you always sign, then encrypt, and do
not leak any information about the recipient's public key in the
ciphertext, it should be impossible to see who's sending valid messages.
I'm thinking a cipher like curve25519-xsalsa20-poly1305 so that the
ciphertext fits in a tweet, at least if you strip the
 off the front.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using SDR 
Indeed. Having a spotter there is probably the best solution.
This is why you use an attenuator. I wouldn't think law enforcement DF
equipment would be fooled by such a thing, since for example FCC will often
be looking for people who are outputting too much power, which on the ham
bands is going to be multiple kilowatts (I think they've mostly given up on
CB except when it starts interfering with licensed users).
Perhaps, but I'm not about to suggest that anyone break the law.
How do you train out of band? By modelling the environment? That's an
interesting thought, and I suspect Google Earth has enough data to be able
to do it in a lot of places. Are you aware of free or inexpensive software
packages for doing this?
Aren't you just talking phased array for something like this though? Or do
you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer
your beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360
degree view with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some
blind humans can use clicks to get a picture of their entire environment.
(I use humans and not bats because I think bat sonar is pretty directional,
whereas human ears can localize sound quite precisely without any need to
turn one's head.)
This is definitely an area I'm interested in, so I'd love to hear more of
your ideas, as may Jeremy, so if it's beyond what is generally tolerated on
this list, private email would be fine, or if you have a list in mind I'd
be happy to subscribe if I'm not already.

Sorry about that. I had initially considered including a reference, but I

Geolocation data for IPs is of varying quality. Facebook's likely comes
from a combination of commercial and open/free sources, along with some
machine learning based on features of people coming from those IPs. For the
most part, I doubt Facebook is trying to look at/parse the whois data
directly, since often the address of the owner of a block has nothing to do
with the actual location of a block.

Yep, a dead-man switch of some kind is a good idea regardless of what other
techniques you're using.
Sure, but if you have a very long (or effectively infinite) PN sequence,
your carrier needs to be structured enough to recover some large counter.
GPS qualifies, as probably does WWV and its non-US brethren.
Sure, if you don't care about MIMO, there are lots of ways to steer your
beam using relatively cheap circuitry. You can have multiple
transmit/receive antennas and just adjust their relative phase. AIUI this
is how the LoJack locators operate. Switching reflectors on and off
independently as you suggest here would allow multiple beams, though their
relative phase would not be adjustable. It all goes toward the goal of
minimizing the amount of energy you emit that isn't directed toward the
receiver, though.
Thanks for posting the latest version of your slides. I read what I think
was an earlier version previously. I am working on upgrading my amateur
radio license, so soon I will get some experience with some of the weak
signal modes you talk about.

Agree with the need for decentralized architectures, though ZeroNet is only
part of the way there. It's fine for small, static sites, blogs, and small
chat rooms, but the mail and ID services are each controlled by one
individual, and all their data are flooded to all users. We really need a
platform on which to build decentralized apps, more like Freenet or Gnunet.
As for centralization in Tor, it wasn't clear to me from the article that
the related sites were actually legit as opposed to, say, clones. Since
they found sites that only linked among themselves, they must have just
been mass scanning onion addresses. But what we really care about are the
sites a lot of people actually use. For such a purpose, finding and ranking
the sites by spidering from a few well-known seed sites would be more
useful than enumerating all the hidden sites. They talked about a bunch of
sites being hosted by the same hosting provider, but given that they had
identical SSH host keys I'd guess they were all actually the same machine,
since it would be criminally negligent for a hosting provider to use the
same key across all its machines.
