@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle vs Pluggable Transports Tor Browser 
Hi All,
After reading  I'm curious why the Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle is a different package/download than the Tor Browser Bundle? As we can see on for example  , the Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle need to be updated/packaged 'manually' by the maintainer(s), with an older Tor version (0.2.4.15-beta2-pt1 vs 0.2.4.16-rc). And when visiting check.torpoject.org, my Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle says I need to update because of security issues, but there is no newer Why not building the Pluggale Transports like obfs2 and obfs3 in the 'normal' Tor Browser Bundle?
