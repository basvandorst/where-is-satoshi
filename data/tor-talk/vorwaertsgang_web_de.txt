@_subject: simple user question - someone please reply! 
Hello TOR community members,
this question might seem stupid to you, but it is essential for TOR usage, and with my knowledge as a user-only, I couldn't answer it with the TOR documentation/FAQ.
Why is it that when I enter a non-existant URL in Firefox/TOR (e.g.  ), I receive a screen ( from MY internet provider saying the requested site couldn't be found AND containing the requested URL in a search field?
This means that whether I'm using TOR or not, my provider always knows the URLs of the sites I access (or try to access), right?
TORs "exit node" is a step in front of my provider, so my provider can log which sites I access, and, in case I don't use encrypted connections, even all content I access. And he knows WHO's accessing it. How else can it be that I receive that screen containing the URL I tried to access?
Please answer or tell where I can find an answer I can understand without a lot of technical knowledge.
Thank you!!
