is torservers.net able and allowed to run this hidden service? a trusted organization is needed to run web-tor relay and hidden service.
right, 20 mails a day will do. the service does not need to be free.
your effort is very much appreciated.
how did privacybox.de get around that?
i am not capable of coming up with this system on my own. anyone else in on this? Jake? codeman?
what about enforcing tls so metadata is reduced? this violated RFC 2487. we are living in dark and dangerous times. maybe two relays could be used, one requiring tls one does not.

everyone is tooting about pgp these. pgp encryption doesnt solve the problem of tla surveillance. pgp encryption does not touch metadata (recipent, sender).
how to secure mail communication?
i was thinking about pointing the mx record of the tld to a mail server that is shared with other individuals. the server is configured to drop incoming non-tls smtp connection from other mail server. On a per account basis, every message that is not encrypted to the public pgp key of the address is dropped, too. users use pop3/smtp over a hidden server to download/send messages.
what do you think? the setup is easy to maintain. if inbox size is limited to a few mbs any cheap vps thats like 20$ a year can be used to service hundreds of thousands of accounts. a trusted umbrella organization is needed to maintain the server as anonymity is increased by increasing users count. is the tor project or torservers.net interested in running such a service? i would literally pay money for that, so would others.

============================== START ==============================
StartMail/tormail does not solve the problem of metadata either. i do not want to hide my identity. i want to use my real name and communicate with people i know in real life. its about *enforcing* content encryption and secure communication so an outside observer cannot easily correlate my social network by snooping on mail traffic at net gateways.
