Hi there,
I am new and searched the archives to find this before I asked but couldn't
find the answer.
I ask your forgiveness please if it is somewhere there but I couldn't find
it. Thank you.
I am just wondering, I have the Tor IM Browser Bundle with Firefox and
Pidgin and am taking it off my old computer before I give my computer away.
If I just delete the Pidgin folder that is self contained in the Tor Browser
folder will that be enough to delete my Pidgin chat logs that I saved?
Or are they saved in another place?
Also, is there any browser history that I might need to delete?
Again, I am very sorry that I couldn't find this answer and I very much
appreciate any assistance you could provide.
I would like to give my computer away to someone who doesn't have a computer
and if I could delete these pidgin chat logs first that would be great.
Thank you,

Thank you very much for this info about wiping the drive. I will do that.
For reference about deleting the logs so I can know this for my other
computers as well, if I just delete the entire Tor IM Browser Bundle folder,
will this delete all the Pidgin Chat logs and web history from the Tor
Or is there some extra step I need to take to delete all of these Pidgin
chat logs and web history?
Thank you for your expertise. There are many intelligent people on this
list, I appreciate your knowledge.
