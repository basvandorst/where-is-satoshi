@_subject: [tor-talk] Flash, Linux and Tor 
Hi! Let`s say main linux user A is cut off from Internet with iptables,
user B starts Tor. If I run TorBrowser by user A, connect it to Tor
(which is started by B) with socks and turn on flash plugin, is there
any security/anonimity leak in this scheme? Thank you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TB download improvement 
Hey there, Tor devs :) IMHO present torproject.org is very difficult
for average internet user. For those who don`t know english well, it
is almost impossible to find proper link.  I think it is the question of resources - to provide multilingual
website up to date, which Tor team just doesn`t have. So I have two
suggestions that require minimal effort:
1. Easy one. Make a static link like
2. A bit harder. Make a page for each language and OS with script that
starts downloading latest release:
" for example. Advantage of this
method will be that you can provide some message, like version or
other important stuff.
People like one big red button DOWNLOAD and nothing else, so
if you couldn`t provide it due to any reason, you can shift
explanation and marketing stuff onto volunteers that can speak on the
target group`s language. Without static links it is almost impossible to
make people to "go there, click here, than choose there, don`t click
anything else"...

Andrew Lewman:
No, but average user need to click on it, then choose language (btw
the list is barely seen) and then click "Download" again. I was talking about descriptions outside torproject.org for
non-english-speaking people. Imagine blog post that describes benefits
of Tor and a link to page that starts downloading right away (or after
few seconds). And compare it to the same thing but with a link to page
that only leads to download by several (obscure) clicks.
It is not my imagination, people keep asking me to pass a right link
to TB, because they just can`t understand what and how they need to
find and click to start right download. I was talking about something like this. (just random link from main
sourceforge page)
You see, I can click on it, the page has info about what would be
downloaded and downloading is started.
Maybe I`m wrong, I don`t know, but imo the main problem for users now is
not running and using (it is pretty easy, thank to devs), but finding
and getting TB.
Ok, I am not going to argue with you anyway, you`re the boss :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden server path 
Hi! I wonder, is there a way for some malicious node (or someone except
client and hidden server) to spy upon path part or GET request of .onion
service? I mean "path/to/somewhere.html" part in
 url, not
physical location. Thanks!

So path can be seen by client and server that hosts hidden service,
malicious or not. Are you sure? :) I mean as I know SSL connection via
https protocol is done like "Connecting to server -> Establishing
secure connection -> After that go to target page, make requests,
download all things etc. ". So global observer cannot see what is
transferred (what I`d like to know for sure is path and GET request),
only the fact of connection and some encrypted traffic
- is this somewhat valid for onion-land? Thanks!

Hi! Did I understand right: if a page has a link (or image), then with
clicking on that link I give the _whole_
 as referer? Or
just part of it - domain? Thanks!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Cookie management in tor-browser 
Does it work for you? I mean in new TB it works well once before I
delete some cookie and close TorButton cookie manager. Then it just
doesn`t see any cookies and "Protect new cookies" is on and can`t be
changed, even whit TB restart. This behavior is on my 86_6x Linux
desktop and in Tails.
