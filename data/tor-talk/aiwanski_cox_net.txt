Can someone please help me.  I have lost access to all my files.  I do not understand any of this and need to access my stuff.  I can be reached at 480-688-1048.  I tried following the directions but it didn't work.

I'm screwed.  But it they ain't getting my money.  My files weren't that valuable to me or anyone else.  We can never let the terrorists win.  If Joe is right about the cause, no.
His stuff is encrypted, and he needs the passphrase.
