@_subject: [tor-talk] Ubuntu Tor Packages 
Canonical keep fix releases package version, only when there is a newer
version for this fixed one available  (minor patches) they going to upgrade.
I see the problem here, but it's always recommended  to use the
official  repository from Tor in Ubuntu.
Hope that this succeeded  it would reduce the effort to get Tor running
on Ubuntu. In my experience  with packages and Canonical there try to
avoid work in such way.
I just see a little hope that this will be happening, but just my humble
opinion. Thank you for the work and good luck.
Best regards.

Hi Just my 50 cent to this.
I consider blocking of the network as an act of last resort.
Instead you need to make the life for the spammer more difficult.
Having a moderator might be a better idea. Maybe moderate just the incoming posts from suspect IPs.
Blocking implies always to exclude legit traffic as well. This removes the freedom of a user. In my experience there are chances that he find another way around. Then you need to update the list again....makes your life more difficult.
Hope this can help you.
best regards
