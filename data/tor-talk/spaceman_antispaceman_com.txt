@_subject: [tor-talk] Harvard student used Tor to send bomb threats, 
1. They knew when the email arrived give or take (from headers).
2. They knew who connected to Tor at that particular time (from
network logs).
Even on college campus there might be a couple of Tor users. I would
have used SSH to get to a 'unmonitored network', Tor and then mixmaster.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Darknet Sites Shutdown 
Does anyone know if this was user or operator error, or vulnerabilities in application used that the FBI know about and are actively exploiting?  Basically does anyone how they managed to take so many 'hidden' services?
I can't believe that 400 sites all made stupid mistakes thus revealing their identity. Therefore they must have had an exploit that they are using to take down all these sites (either in tor or some other application).
