@_subject: [tor-talk] Bandwidth Observed of Relays 
Dear All,
I would like to know, How can we know recently bandwidth observed of relays?
I try to find on torstatus.blutmagie.de and torstatus.all.de
both of them, give different information about recent write/read bandwidth history. and also, both of them give information not actual information, however bandwidth information from yesterday.
is it possible we can know actual bandwidth of relays (Bandwidth capacity and bandwidth usage? if yes, how?

Hi All,
I confused about bandwidth in TOR, there are Bandwidth Max, Burst, and Where I can get information about them?
When will we use three of them?

You are right when we configure multi nodes with fingerprint it will take time.
Or have you try to use ExitNodes with country code?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Nodes 
Hi all,
I would like to know, is there possibility to use just only one node in tor network?
I just think about to use middle node is vpn.
so the concept
caller ---- tor node ----- vpn server ----- tor node ------ callee
if there is possibility, how to configure it?
I have try to use two nodes, and succeed. and I try to use one node, tor network establish, but application which will use tor node rejected.
thank you,
Best regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Nodes 
OK, thank you for your explanation,
other question:
1. is there a way in tor relay to set stable bandwidth which we want to use it?
because I need stable bandwidth around 35 kbps for transferred and received.
2. How to know, how many user in relay that used for the relay which we pass through?, so if we know the user of relay, so we can predict how much bandwidth we will get it.
currently, I try to find relay with high bandwidth, and configure it as entry node and exit node.
I have test VoIP call with using 3 nodes and 2 nodes of TOR, and I got some result with latency lower than 400 ms. That mean, in TOR network, there is possibility to make anonymous VoIP call. in my test, I need stable bandwidth at least 35 Kbps.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Exclude nodes? 
instead you use country code, better you use fingerprint, you can find finger print in vidalia software, just copy it to you torrc, or u can find relays which fast, stable, and high bandwidth in ExcludeExitNodes $fingerprint,$fingerprint,$fingerprint,...

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to Control middle Nodes? 
Hi all,
I want to know how to control middle nodes in TOR?
Currently, I want to do voip through Tor network, i have tried make 10 test call, but only 2 test call with latency less than 400 ms, so, my plan to control nodes in tor which through by voice packet.
I did "EntryNodes $fingerprint,..." and "ExitNodes $fingerprint,..." in Torrc to control entry and exit node. But i can not control middle node. So I want to know, is there a way to control middle nodes? If so, how?. Perhaps, with control all nodes, i can decrease latency.
I am looking forward to hear from all of you,
Best Regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to Control middle Nodes? 
My test, based on windows, so for VoIP clients I use Phonerlite, it use UDP. because of TOR is TCP based, I will use openvpn to transferring udp packet through TOR network.
Caller and Callee know each other. so this concept will anonymous to third party only.
I will use tor network only without hidden services.
I have make calling test with default tor configuration, from 10 calling test, I got 2 calling test with latency less than 400 ms. so, in my mind, there is possibility to transfer voice packets through tor network.
in this test, I need tor bandwidth constantly about 30-34 kbps. and then, I configure Entry and Exit Nodes with high bandwidth. I did calling test for this configuration. but did not calculate yet the result.
for Entry and Exit Nodes, we can configure in torrc files,
we can use "EntryNodes $fingerprint,$fingerprint,$..." for specific entry nodes and "ExitNodes $fingerprint,$fingerprint,..." for specific exit nodes. but for middle nodes, I don't know how to set it up. Reducing latency in this case, I should configure all nodes (entry,middle,exit) in same Continent and try to find nodes with high bandwidth and low user. to connect openvpn and tor i use privoxy as socks5 proxy.
in windows, is there TorCtl file?

I would like to know about degree of anonymity in TOR network.
Where can i find documentation for this?
Right now, I can describe only probability of attacker with some condition.
what is correlation between degree of anonymity and probability?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Daily TOR relays data 
Dear All,
any one knows how to get daily TOR relay data such as CSV file on I need daily relay data from January 2010.
So I try to predict how many user, relays, and Bandwidth for future on TOR network.
Just FYI, i did research VoIP over TOR, on December 2012, and the result is only 24 % acceptable call for 3 TOR Relays, and 31 % acceptable call for 2 TOR relays.
So, I need daily relays data for my research, where is I can find? and how?

@_subject: [tor-talk] VOIP over Tor 
I have researched VoIP over TOR, I use openVPN to communicate voip client with tor network. I test with default tor - 3 nodes and modify tor with 2 nodes. With 3 TOR nodes, from 100 call, only 21 call which have acceptable quality call, whereas with 2 tor nodes, i got 36 acceptable quality call.
We should concern with recomendation for real time voice communication. ITU G 114 recomendation, maximum latency should be less than 400 ms. Others recommendation are jitter (less than 30 ms) and packet loss ( less than 5 %).
I did test only for nodes in european.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Number of tor users 
Dear All,
I would like to know, where i can find data average number of tor users? As I know, number of users in metrics.torproject.org are total number in a day. So how can I know a average?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Number of tor users 
Hi Karsten,
Thank you for fast reply.
So, now more clear for me to understand.
I try to calculate average Bandwidth per User based on Data from metrics.torproject.org and I got around 30-40 Kbps/user. but it is total bandwidth/average daily user. if I want to calculate end-to-end bandwidth, the result i divide 3. with assumption we have 3 relays to establish connection (Entry, middle and exit). each relays have equal bandwidth (only assumption, in the reality, total bandwidth for 3 relays are different). then, average bandwidth connection is 10 - 15 Kbps.
in VoIP case, we need 30-35 Kbps (iLBC and Speex codec) to have good quality calls.
then my next question, does TOR ensure the bandwidth for users? at least each user can get minimum bandwidth around 30 Kbps.
Thank you before,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Number of tor users 
I have test VoIP call through TOR, we have 54 % acceptable call for 5 % packet more than 400 ms. this result was for voip call with 2 tor relays.
but now, I do not how to explain, correlation between acceptable call and available tor bandwidth. because of that, I try to calculate bandwidth per user based on data from metrics.torproject.org but my professor said it does not make sense. So I need to make test end-to-end to get bandwidth network then measure average.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Increasing TOR Users. 
Dear All,
I just surprised,
just a view minutes ago, I read TOR user statistic. and i found, TOR users are increasing madly. On July, when i did VoIP experiment on TOR network, at that time, TOR users was around 500000 users, but now more than 4 million.
who can explain this? what happen with TOR network? is it botnet attacks?
next week, I plan to make another VoIP experiment, I will analyze effect of increasing tor users to Quality of Service VoIP call.
I am looking forward to hear from you all.

Dear All,
Does some one calculate degree of anonymity of TOR network? I would like to know degree of anonymity of TOR network, using 2 relays and 3 relays. How to explain, using 3 relays are more anonymous than 2 relays?
I have try to calculate using Shannon Entropy, but the result, with 2 relays is same with 3 relays.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Current attack of TOR to break anonymity 
Dear All,
is there any attack can be break anonymity in TOR network? if so, how?
I assume, if I want to break anonymity in the TOR network, I should take
control all of relays which are used by sender and destination as a
transmission media.
with this assumption, It is easy to show the differences attacker
probability in TOR network 2 relays or more relays.
some papers explained that TOR network can be broke by attacker take
control in entry and exit relays. so what differences if we use more relays
on path-link?
even there is attacker only need entry relays to break anonymity in TOR
network. so the path-link does not affect the level of anonymity.
where I can find the source explanation the kind of attacks that related
with path-link of the TOR network?
or how can we show it, with less relays on path-link will have less
if no differences, why TOR network use 3 TOR relays instead of 2 TOR relays
in path-link?
Thank you for advanced,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fundamental differences between Onion Routing and The 
Dear All,
Where I can find information about the fundamental differences between Onion Routing (OR) and The Onion Router (TOR)?
what I know is The OR allow repeated use of router, for example, Routers used as entry relay can be used again as the exit relay when the path length of the network is more than two relays. However, this does not allow in TOR network.
and also, TOR network has been added perfect forward secrecy, congestion control, directory servers, integrity checking, configurable exit policies, and practical design for location-hidden services via rendezvous point that all features were not formerly found in Onion Routing (OR).
How about selection of the routers? TOR network select relays on TOR users side (vidalia), so the user can select multiple relays to be used as an entry or exit relays. the OR?
