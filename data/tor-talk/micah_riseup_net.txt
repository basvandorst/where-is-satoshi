@_subject: [tor-talk] Replacing a dirauth: Welcome longclaw 
Thanks Mike for all the work running turtles as a DirAuth!
I just wanted to clarify that this DirAuth is happening thanks to Riseup
Networks[0]. Riseup has been a long time supporter of the Tor Project:
running exit nodes, handing out bridges for BridgeDB, hosting the Tails
project issue tracker, and more. Its a natural fit for Riseup to also
support a DirAuth!
0. riseup offered for this dirauth to be run on their infrastructure, thanks and more power to them"
