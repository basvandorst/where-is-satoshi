If you connect to Tor first, then visit hidemyass or similar and then
register, if you do that only once, I see no problem with that as long
you only use it for registration and not entering identifying data.
Note that hidemyass or similar will know the whole content of the
transmission because it's a web based proxy. Therefore change your
secret answer, alternate e-mail and passwords after setting up the account.
The question remains if after account creation you will have less
trouble over Tor or if hidemyass or similar isn't blocked for
registration as well.

Jerzy ?ogiewa:
There are options. Provide a free SSH, VPN or proxy. Or for simplicity
provide a web based proxy such as hidemyass is using. That's called cgi
proxy and I think I've seen free open source implementations.
Then allow only a few outgoing sites. You can also allow only Tor users
to connect (and show non-Tor users a notice).
Be prepared for abuse, you can not know if they user your IP for
registration, bomb thread or other kinds of abuse.
You can post your suggestion into the Tor trac as well. Don't expect any
or fast progress. Before they ever implement such stuff they check for
anonymity issues and they require loads of research before they add
something. In meanwhile you are probable better of providing the cgi
proxy I suggested.
But if you ask me, forget about "gmx and others" and use "riseup and
others" and GPG or e-mail alternatives.
That said, home users are probable a better help for the Tor project if
they volunteer a bridge, relay, documentation, translation, code, and so
on, see torproject.org volunteer site.

Got it. Good point. There has been very few research done on that subject.
Always makes sense to use a trustworthy mail provider as an activist
instant of a non-trustworthy. Even if you use GPG. They can still try a
targeted attack on your browser of tell who is communicating with whom
and sell some metadata like when you logged in etc.
Riseup has been recommend by (imho) trustworthy and honest people.
Tormail is anonymously run, could be run by evil or honest people. Who
knows. 50/50 chance I'd say. If they are honest, they can not be forced
into cooperating with an adversary. In that case they were even better
than Riseup. Or they are already run by your adversary and then you are
left with the protections provided by Tor (and gpg).
On the other hand riseup hosts servers in US, thus they are subject to
US laws.
Other then using a well motivated and known mail provider you could try
a different approach. If your whistleblow is about country X, use a mail
provider in country Y. Any countries (almost) in war with each other are

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor: lobbies vs lobbies - Who will prevail? 
There are various lobbies.
- Some "Pro-Tor" (also pro privacy, pro any anonymity network).
- Some "Anti-Tor".
"Pro-Tor" lobbies:
- journalists
- - Perhaps mostly notable: Tor was originally designed, implemented, and
deployed as a third-generation onion routing project of the ***Naval
Research Laboratory***. It was originally developed with the ***U.S.
Navy*** in mind, for the primary purpose of protecting government
communications. [1]
Strong "Anti-Tor" lobbies and arguments:
- anti cp
If they Use-Tor-right, especially the only-downloaders, the they can
never get caught. Unsatisfactory.
- anti drugs [2]
Silkroad runs and runs and runs for a loooong time. Unsatisfactory.
- copyright infringements
If they Use-Tor-right, especially the only-downloaders, the can download
and download and download and never get caught. DMCA for the exit node
and again and again. "We can do nothing." in response. Unsatisfactory.
Solution for anti-Tor lobbies? Propose anti-Tor, anti-anon proxy law.
(Forbidden to develop, forbid to provide download, forbid to download,
forbid to use, forbidde to host servers, etc.) Could happen in any
"free" country, including US. Then send lots of donations to politicians
and beg for it, send even more donations. The typical lobbying.
So who has more power in this fight? I think the anti-Tor lobbies are
not to be underestimated and I seriously fear that Tor is going to loose
the battle within the next years. The political climate with laws like
ACTA, PIPA etc. makes that plausible for me. Glad if you can prove me wrong.

Hash: SHA512
There are not only technical attacks against the Tor network. Another
strong attack against Tor are legal attacks (i.e. attacking with laws,
not saying the attack is legal). The adversary tries to put Tor into
the worst light and tries to convince politicians to issue laws to
forbid Tor.
Recently it has been discussed to create statistics about for what Tor
is being used most. There are claims and discussions, that Tor is
mostly used for "bad" things.
Many powerful groups would gladly see Tor and any anonymous proxy
dead. Even whole countries are blocking Tor. (China, Iran, etc.) Also
other groups were happy if there were no anonymous proxies. (anti
copyright infringement, anti drug abuse, etc.)
Exit nodes:
- - by Tor design, don't know who is requesting the traffic
- - resolve DNS
- - obviously must know the IP of the destination are asked to connect to
- - can log the amount of traffic transfered
- - can log at which times how much traffic was transfered to a specific IP
- - can even log a curve, how much/less traffic was transfered, when it
The attack:
- - The adversary writes a program, a robot.
- - He keeps the source code of the robot secret.
- - He either rents anonymously a few virtual servers or a state-wide
adversary can also force a few local internet service providers to
grant many different IP's in different subnets and self host the servers.
- - He uploads only an obfuscated version of the robot to the servers.
- - Additionally he could put something legitimate on the servers for
distraction of the real purpose.
- - The robot will fetch "bad" www or .onion websites and imitate a human.
- - Imitation will be done by imitating mouse clicking, perhaps by
imitating using Tor Browser Bundle (for traffic fingerprint), by
randomizing the time between "mouse clicks", by randomizing the time
"viewing" a site, by randomizing how long he "stays" on the website,
by randomizing or imitating etc.
- - From one IP/connection the adversary can run many instances of Tor
or build many Tor circuits.
- - At the beginning only a very few robots will do that, to avoid the
fraud being detected. The amount of "Tor users" (which are actually
robots) from the attacking country will grow slowly, so it looks
- - Optionally, to strengthen the attack, the adversary could also host
or support "bad" hidden services. Run an exit node as well and push
for "creating Tor statistics" to "prove" Tor is mostly used for "bad"
things to get a reason to ban it.
I am sure, if the robot and attack is well designed, neither exit
nodes nor anyone else are able to distinguish between robots and
humans. They also can not find out that such a attack was run from one
specific country.
In conclusion, even if we had a statistic, they're possibly or likely
manipulated by a (powerful*) adversary who wants to see Tor shut down.
*powerful: The actual programming of the robot can be probable done
even by a low skilled programmer or otherwise cost very little (below
1000$) compared to a powerful adversary who can easily spend a lot
money. Perhaps also running the attack is cheap, it would have to be
tested how well many circuits and robots scale on low cost vps to have
a significant impact on the statistics.
Best defense against this attack is to develop the robot, to test-wise
run it and to prove it's working. That would make any statistics about
Tor less credible.

The lockdown part is too shortly described. How? Iptables?
Yes. Just a few things coming to my mind...
You should not use Firefox. Use Tor Browser. [1] How to you use Tor
Browser without running Tor over Tor?
What you basically need, is to use a similar concept like aos. [2]
Even if you can prevent IP and DNS leaks, Java and Flash can leak more
information than that, such as your time zone and system time. [3]
Who checked if Java or Flash do not use your MAC address to correlate
with your previous activities? Flash is a black box and Adobe is not
known for putting much value into users privacy. The VM can see MAC
address of your host. It's possible to prevent this. [4]
Apart from MAC address there are other caveat. Even the name of the user
account could be used for correlation.
Also forcing the whole system through a single Tor port opens up for
Identity correlation through circuit sharing. [5] Your operating system
update mechanism inside the VM might go through the same Tor circuit
including all the stuff flash already reveals.
It your guest operating system is Windows, it gets worse. They send a
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) while updating. If you send it once in
the clear and once over Tor, mixed up with flash traffic... [6]
System time correlation is also at risk. [7]

Tor Browser does indeed not care, but flash does. Tor Browser does not
modify flash in any way. You are right, worst thing that may happen is
that flash can obtain timezone and system time, so be sure to obscure it.
How do you get all the operating system updates?
It's not about the ISP. There are applications, which do read the MAC
address of your computer. Some copyright protection tools and anti
cheat tools do so.
Ok. Recommend reading aos standpoint about (random) macs in public
networks. [5] Just read and consider if it applies to your threat model.
Sounds good.
So far so good. How do you install the updates then?
Like I wrote in TorifyHOWTO [1], a wrapper (torsocks etc.) is just a
redirector, not a jail. You can't simply use a warpper to torify Java
Inside a VM, well, the operating system does not know the real
external IP address. What one does not know, can one not tell anyone.
Interesting idea. Good luck with it. We created leak tests [2] for
aos, it can be useful for other projects as well. Some tools need
alternative windows applications or just skip those tests.
Since you are not using a transparent proxy, but host-only + wrapper,
most things transparent proxy leaks [3] probable do not apply. Reading
that page anyway can't hurt.
I'd also ask coderman [4] for feedback on that setup.
One more concern: you an only be anonymous within a big group of
people. The amount of users who use Windows + Flash or Windows + Java
anonymously must be pretty low, since there are few discussions about
it and the setup is quite complicated. Also due to the browser
fingerprinting stuff it's safe to assume you are only pseudonymous,
rather than anonymous.

My review:
I really think before you activate IsolateDestAddr/Port for web, Nick's
or Roger's option is required.
Overall looks pretty well for "basic" stream isolation. For "full"
stream isolation, also ssh, apt-get and any other (preinstalled)
application with network traffic should be stream separated.
IsolateDestAddr/IsolateDestPort for iceweasel we ship: nowadays, loading
a mere web page often requires fetching resources from a dozen or more
remote sources.
browser may create very uncommon HTTP behaviour patterns, that could
ease fingerprinting.)
Safe to assume.
identities. If you connect with all of the accounts at the same time,
they'll all get the same circuit, so the identities can be correlated.
While Tails does not formally support using multiple contextual
identities at the same time, Pidgin generally opens very few network
connections, so the performance impact of using IsolateDestAddr should
be small. Given how cheap it is, it looks like it is worth having Pidgin
use a (not necessarily dedicated) SocksPort that has IsolateDestAddr and
IsolateDestPort enabled.
True. Difficult to document.
"Multiple accounts are separated, if they are on different server IP's
(not DNS entries). They can get correlated if they share the same jabber
server IP. If your internet connection gets lost for any reason, your
system crashes for any reason, or you disconnect all accounts at once
(close Pidgin), all accounts will go offline at the same time. Therefore
if an adversary controls several IP's he can still guess they are all
owned by the same pseudonym."
Good thoughts on that page.
And to make the fingerprinting issues a bit more complicated... Someone
using stream isolation can probable be fingerprinted form someone not
using stream isolation. Example: view sourceforge.org with a torified
webbrowser, look at the ssh documentation site. Ssh to sf.net over
another stream. Now it's clear, someone is using aos (or similar
project, or stream isolation,) or Tails with "full" stream isolation.
But I think that's fine. You already trust sourceforge.org by connecting
to it with a webbrowser and ssh while giving the exit node less
information. Very theoretical, right now there are more urgent
fingerprinting issues with the web browser.
If you link your implementation, I'll review it as well.
I initially proposed the feature for Tails and now I am considering your
improvements for aos. Nice!

Let alone the neglected torsocks which is affected by so many serious

buggy proxifiers as well.
And all the people messing up correct torification and using leaking
applications and endless discussions and uncertainty if there are leaks

Compare this with the i2p network and applications designed for the i2p
network. The i2p network has arguably a different threat model and
security features but one thing you will (not) be missing in the i2p
community: discussions whether applications do leak or do actually
correctly use i2p.

For other apps with socks5 support... If you ask the developers if

application is more than proper socks5 support.
Look into the TorifyHOWTO.
It's a real mess. Read the disclaimers in TorifyHOWTO. They seem to be

information leakages at the protocol level should be considered as ?

Who ever audited applications and protocols for Tor safety? TBB,
TorBirdy and TorChat... Any others? And even if they did, further
updates of the application would require new audits. I think it's
better to have applications designed for Tor from scratch and by purpose.
I think if a Tor library and instructions how to design a protocol
and/or application Tor-safe from scratch would have been created in

Me neither. On the other hand the "protocol audit" mess is even worse.

Yes, that's why there is now the Tor Browser Bundle.
I am also interested. What happened to him?
I and (at least) two other people used to do it.
Old article page (now deprecated):
Some interesting versions...
Very first version:
First version using Virtual Box:
At one point we had three installation methods. A installation tutorial,
a shell script and a binary distribution.
All historic versions are still alive:
The more questions answered, even more new questions came up...
"We have a middlebox now. But how to add a hidden service? ... Are we
allowed to download operating system updates through Tor? What do we do
against identity correlation through circuit sharing?"
See the Dev page and the Dev archive for things we discussed:
The more security added, the more optional configurations added, the
bigger the tutorial became. After a becoming a documentation project, a
shell script to help with the many configuration scripts was created,
because that was still too difficult for many people, binary builds
(downloads) were created.
History of Whonix:
I don't think there can be something like a noob friendly HOWTO. The
TorBOX developers were very serious about it and ended up with a
software project instead. Whonix:
A secure HOWTO, would be too big and therefore no longer noob friendly.
It's all too complex.
Yes. Advantages, disadvantages and differences:

Not that simple. See Stream Isolation:

do van den Heuvel:
I recommend using a Tor-only environment to protect yourself from leaks:
Whonix. Can't hurt to learn how it works and to build from source.
After you do no longer need to care about correct torification you can
choose any server software, which relies on TCP since UDP is not
supported by Tor.
I find the SquirrelMail (what tormail also uses) quite good because it
has a webinterface independent of javascript.
It would be very difficult to offer communication with regular clearnet
e-mail accounts. That requires clearnet servers, they a hard to get
anonymously for a good price and and they are constantly harassed.
This will be difficult. Enhanced hidden services for anyone and an
active TorChat development were everything is decentral gives even less
power to admin. But you asked for hosting, not for development ideas.
Cryptocat maybe?

Not sure what you mean by set up. You just need to import them.
Install help screenshots:
Install help video (html5, no flash player required):
I think that's simpler than any guide. The hardest remaining part is the
social engineering part. No anonymity setup can spare users from
educating themselves. Example:
There is space for improvement. The next huge step to make it even
simpler would be a Whonix USB installer, which takes care of installing
the host operating system (maybe OneVM).
Or if we don't want to go that far the setup of importing two virtual
machines could be made simpler by creating an installer doing that task.
Also the Virtual Box controls could be simplified.
We had that running as well:
Actually we had a complete guide which included a one file shell script.
I never liked it because you end up with different instructions for
different host operating systems. That's contradictory with the goal of
making things simpler. Due to the difficulties to deploy it, much less
users can profit from it.
Feel free to takeover OneVM.
Good luck with your journey. This field of development needs more
people. Whatever path you will choose, it will be an enrichment.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Interested in a Tor Browser update script for Debian, 
Downloading and gpg verifying Tor Browser each time there is an update
gets really tiresome and I think many people either never gpg verified
or don't do it sometimes.
What if we had a Debian package which contains a Tor Browser updater?
I could eventually provide something like this:
sudo apt-get install torbrowser-updater
torbrowser -update
No manual download and verification would be required.
I wrote a script to do it. It can do everything automatically. It
renames the old TB folder (after success), downloads, fetches the gpg
keys from the keyservers, gpg verifies and extracts it. Start menu
entries and icons are ready. Also an update checker is basically done.
Anyone interested?
Just details have to be sorted out. And a Debian package has to be
created. Anyone willing to help?
Open questions:
Do we download the Tor Browser archive in the clear or through Tor  have
an option for that?
Download the Tor Browser signing keys dynamically from the keyservers
(more prone to errors when keyserver is down) or ship the public keys?
If the signing keys change the package needs to be updated so or so,
because there is no package with the signing keys. [3]
Alternatives [1] [2].... None?
[1] Debian package with Tor Browser
Tickets  "Make a deb of the Torbrowser and add to repository" [1[
and  "Get TorBrowser in Debian" would only solve the Linux issue
and are totally unrealistic. [2]
Disto policy is a blocker. Tor Browser is too much of a hack. Too much
writing into the home (profile) folder. Distro policy wants to prevent
code duplication and does forbid to write (the profile) into the home
folder. The policy or packer advice is for such cases is "put the
functionality upstream".
Exactly this won't work either. According to distro policy it would be
best if the Tor Browser specific changes to Firefox could be activated
with a command line option. Ideally it could look like this...
The iceweasel package would look like:
- depends on iceweasel-bin
- depends on iceweasel-starter, i.e. normal iceweasel (Firefox) starter,
start menu entry and iceweasel icon
A Tor Browser Debian package would look like:
- depends on iceweasel-bin
- depends on torbrowser-starter, i.e. Tor Browser starter, start menu
entry and Tor Browser icon
This won't happen. Mozilla is generally disinterested takes ages to
merge patches. Getting Tor Browser into Linux distros (with Debian-like
policy) won't work.

I think you get more answers if you write the name of the application.
Not directly. Only by using special setups. (Transparent Proxy
Anonymizing Middlebox or Isolating Proxy)
I recognize the term Transparent Proxy has according to it's wiki page
different meanings and can therefore lead us to talk about different things.
Transparent Proxy Anonymizing Middlebox does not prevent getting your
local IP, but you have great freedom to choose from loads of different
local IPs.
Anonymizing Middlebox or Isolating Proxy can prevent the machine behind
it from getting knowledge of it's clearnet IP address, but you didn't
ask for this. I am just adding this to avoid confusion.
The important thing, the clearnet IP is safe. Many information about how
safe are available on the Whonix page. But you didn't ask for that.
The virtual local IP address of Whonix-Workstation is 192.168.0.11 for
all Whonix download users by default. Different form the host operating
system, if the host operating system doesn't use the same by chance.
Leaking... Well. There are to my knowledge no applications installed,
which read and send this IP address somewhere else. But if there where
or if you would install extra software they could indeed read
192.168.0.11. Whonix does not implement protection against it. I never
tried. What is the point of protecting the local IP address behind a
Anonymizing Middlebox / Isolating Proxy?

countries, which is unaccaptable. [links to source in [3]]

In this particlar discussion I meant "no need to use any CAs". (In
general I would be happy to see a widespread replacement for the CAs
as a whole.)
It doesn't exist, unfortunately. It's also a critical security
vulnarability in all major operating system, not only for Tor users,
for anyone. No one cares about as long as no one uses it for a big
scale attack. If an attacker moves back the time several years he can
use revoked certificates.
It's certainly possible but almost no one is using it. I found two
guides about adding authenication to NTP.
(Over TCP is possible as well, Google tells.)
As Tails pointed out...
The system can not be adapted since you will have a hard time finding
public, free NTP servers, which support authenitcated NTP. And even if
you find a very few, you can not rely on a small amount of servers. A
big pool is required for distribiuted trust.

Ok, I am sorry, I messed up. There is no way to run NTP *directly*

We could run NTP over Tor, if we tunnel UDP over OnionCat. Due to
usage of hidden services, Tor would provide authentication. (NTP
autokey could be added for another layer of authenication.) But it
were NTP over TCP over UDP, which wouldn't be (according to the posts
above) exact as ordinary NTP over TCP.
I don't know how less accurate it were and if that is a good idea or
not. Or if we find willing people to run it. Please discuss. If there

So it still depend on the flawed root CA system.
(Don't take this too harsh. Although there is space for improvement I
seriously consider adding tails_htp to aos. Thanks to the distributed
trust model, I think it's currently the safest method.)
If I understand correctly, you pick three random servers. One from each
pool. And then build the mediate of the three.
What's the point of asking the foe pool? (Servers which generally do not
care about privacy.)
Why doesn't tails_htp ask more than three servers for the time and build
the mediate? Like 6, 9 or 12.

Hash: SHA512
Katya Titov:
Neither Tor nor Tails fall into the category "designed for free wifi
networks". If Tails where focused primary at public wifis, their
planed mac changer feature had much more priority. [1] Tor provides
anonymity and circumvention, Tails is a LiveCD/USB designed for
privacy and anonymity. If you use them for their purposes, they are good.
But do you rather risk Tor exit nodes sniffing your traffic than
public wifis? Either you are aware of risks of transmitting data over
insecure networks, which is the internet, and take yourself care of
end to end encryption or you don't care at all.
If you are in an uncensored country, Tor/Tails are not so good for
your general surfing. Slow speed, many youtube videos are not
available because they are blocked in Tor Browser, Google will ask for
captcha, Google mail will require phone authentication, I've read
reports, some accounts such as paypal will get blocked if you access
them over Tor...
At least with iptables I know it's be easy to limit yourself to a few
outgoing ports.
You falsely assume that a free wifi hotspot is less secure than a
regular internet access point. You should configure your system in a
way it doesn't matter if there is a man in the middle. (signed
updates, patched correctly configured software, etc.)
If you believe the free wifi hotspot is less secure than your regular
home/cooperate network, you can build a VPN tunnel to your regular
network. That is also safe and routes all your traffic through it.
Alternatively you could use a VPN service.

Polipo has to listen on your local lan on some Windows or Linux machine.
It must not only listen on 127.0.0.1, but also on the internal LAN IP.
Do not let it listen on WAN. Polipo should then forward the traffic to Tor.

Let's suppose a polipo http listener gets opened on 127.0.0.1:9104, to
which Tor parent socks proxy port should it be mapped? http 9104 to
socks 9105? Any better ideas?

@_subject: [tor-talk] torsocks is broken and unmaintained 
as far I know, it has never been stated like this. Reasons:
1. critical ipv6 bug:
No progress on it for almost one year.
There is a workaround:
But I guess very few people are aware of it.
2. Robert Hogan hasn't participated in any public discussion for a long
3. another annoying bug with patch available:
Patch has been accepted in many Linux distributions including Debian.
Still isn't merged upstream.
4. torsocks not available in torproject.org trac:
Only on google code, which makes collaboration difficult. (You can not
post anonymously to the google code tracker.; You can not have an
anonymous google account, since it requires verification.; Google code
is not accessible from some countries.)
5. I tried to reach Robert Hogan, he replied once, but not again.
uwt (a modified usewithtor to improve Tor stream isolation) has been
written by me:
Basically adds support for adding proxy type, ip and port by command
line. It's generally working well and would be useful to have it
upstream. Either as a separate script or merged with usewithtor. I'd
patch it to his liking but he doesn't seem to have time to discuss it.
Thanks to Robert Hogan for creating and maintaining torsocks! Now it can
be considered broken and unmaintained. Please disagree if you believe my
conclusion is wrong.
What are the consequences?

Joe Btfsplk:
Yes, there is far greater scientific research and no action was taken.
This one doesn't need numbers to quantity the performance gain. It's too
obvious. Just like the earth isn't flat. There is no more proof
required. Almost everyone who ever used Adblock will have felt the
performance and user experience boost.
It's a question if torproject want to go the "web cleaning way". It has
pros and cons.
Torproject also didn't want to go the "clean protocol way", i.e.
creating a Tor-Firefox bundle. They were forced to do so. "Tor in theory
worked somewhat reasonable well enough", but browser fingerprinting
destroyed all the anonymity. TBB was created to address these issues.
Will TBB due to ads ever be that slow that the anonymity given by Tor
and browser fingerprinting defense (TBB) alone just don't make it? If
yes, they will probable go the "web cleaning way".
Adblock-like addon pros:
- Obvious, fewer traffic, faster loading times, better user experience.
Adlbock-like addon cons:
- Would Tor put into a light that they are anti commercial, while they
need the commercials to succeed. If many big ad companies start a
campaign against Tor and talk their clients into banning Tor also for
reading, because "Tor is bad", it's virtually game over for Tor.
Torproject does well by not challenging far bigger players.
I think the right way would be to give people the freedom of choice and
let them decide to opt-in for an ad blocker.

This is very similar to case 2 and (somewhat?) similar to end to end
correlation attack. Tor does not defend against such things by design.
 at lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html
"I haven't given up hope on end-to-end correlation resistance for
low-latency flow-based designs like Tor (but papers like [4] don't make me
optimistic for a quick fix). It's hard to see how we could end up with a
large enough and diverse enough population of Mixminion users to let it
fulfill its potential. Stay tuned to PETS [5] and related conferences,
but be patient."
Right now there are no low latency networks (like Tor) defending against
this attack. Not even theoretically. Mixminion (high latency) could
theoretically defeat it. Practically not due to unsolvable usability
issues noted in the mail linked above.
Is in my opinion also an open research question:
Easy, yes.
 at lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html
"The way we generally explain it is that Tor tries to protect against
traffic analysis, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate,
but Tor can't protect against traffic confirmation (also known as
end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries to confirm a hypothesis
by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Whonix ALPHA 0.4.5 - Anonymous Operating System released 
Hash: SHA512
Hi everyone,
Whonix ALPHA 0.4.5 is now out.
Whonix (called TorBOX or aos in past) is an anonymous general purpose
operating system based on Virtual Box, Debian GNU/Linux and Tor. By
Whonix design, IP and DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with
root rights can find out the user's real IP/location.
This is because Whonix consists of two (virtual) machines. One machine
solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway.
The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a
completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.
This is only a very brief introduction. See Security [1] for a more
comprehensive description, security features and threat model.
Whonix is produced independently from the Tor (r) anonymity software
and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality,
suitability or anything else.
    Applications: Can torify almost any application safely. [13] [14]
  Bridges: (Private) (obfuscated) bridges can be used the same way
they could be used with vanilla Tor. [12]
  VPN/Tunnel Support: combining Whonix with VPNs, proxies or ssh in
any combination is possible. [11]
  Hidden Service Support: You can provide any kind of hidden service
with a greatly reduced risk for IP leaks. [10]
  Windows Support: Whonix-Gateway can also torify Microsoft Windows or
any other operating system. [9]
  Flash Support: Although recommend against Flash, people point
Mozilla Firefox, Flash and socksifier at their feet and pull the
trigger. Whonix is currently the safest method to use Adobe Flash. [15]
Homepage with documentation:
  Or a shorter homepage url:
  Call for help:
  Please test and leave feedback. Since I am currently the only person
developing Whonix, I could need some help.
General content anonymity caution note:
  Whonix uses the best of both worlds, the Isolating Proxy concept [2]
and the Transparent Proxy concept. At the moment there are no known
anonymity leaks or proxy bypass problems. The principal design is less
vulnerable for any kind of leaks. At time of writing (October 2012) I
have been working on the theoretical concept and practical
implementation for 9 months, the basics have been developed by (at
least) three people, adrelanos, smarm and anonymous. [1] [2]
  Although Whonix has been developed with greatest care, a negative,
being leak free or being free form mistakes in the extended project
description [1], can not be proven. This is Whonix's first release
announcement. I hope skilled people look into the concept and
implementation and fail to find anonymity related bugs.

Abel Luck:
UTC is fine. Afaik Tails, Liberte Linux and Whonix are using UTC.
Awareness is fine. If the things which can leak are spoofed, randomized
and/or shared with others, they are less severe.
Setting it to UTC is ok and another time related suggestions is coming
in an extra mail.
I think it still makes sense. Let's say you are using an extra SocksPort
for web and an extra SocksPort for IRC.
After closing the browser it's still useful to issue a new identity to
unlink the sessions before the circuit changes after 10 minutes
I am not a expert on that topic, but from observing stream isolating
doesn't lead to circuits being used longer. All circuits switch after 10
minutes and if you want to do it earlier manually, that's still useful.
Interestingly circuit creation is internally implemented in Tor so well,
that if you have 30 SocksPorts, that won't result in 30 circuits. Tor
still only builds the required regular amount of circuits. Only if you
were to use those 30 SocksPorts all at once you had big amounts circuits.
If users understand it, new identity is a good thing. The bigger problem
are users who don't understand it:
Maybe it should be better renamed to "switch Tor circuit" rather than
"New Identity"?
Persistence will be answered in the other mail along with Tor.
Rest of it sounds pretty good.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Review request: TorVM implementation in Qubes OS 
Abel Luck:
Tor Browser Bundle users are using persistent Entry Guards.
Final goal should be to share the same fingerprint with them (web
fingerprint, traffic fingerprint for local observer). If you manage to
use Tor Browser in the AppVM and Entry Guards in the TorVM, the
fingerprint should be the same. Except, that you added strong security
by isolation for the case of a browser exploit.
Whonix uses persistent Entry Guards and Tor Browser.
Persistent Entry Guards are planed for Tails.
Tor Browser is planed for Tails.
Persistent Entry Guards are considered for Liberte Linux:
Please see recent thread "[tor-talk] Location-aware persistent guards".
So the answer is yes, I in most cases I recommend persistence for Entry
Guards and Tor's data dir. The same goes for Vidalia, since it can be
used to configure Tor and bridges.
Some further thoughts on persistent Entry Guards:
On the other hand, non-persistent Entry Guards are more amnesic. So if

@_subject: [tor-talk] Review request: TorVM implementation in Qubes OS: 
About Vidalia again... I was quickly reading my dev ticket again (
), why it's not yet integrated into Whonix.
"One drawback with Vidalia 0.2.15 remains... As soon as you edit torrc
with Vidalia (i.e. add non-obfuscated bridges, all comments in torrc get
lost, i.e. comments how to add obfuscated bridges get lost.).
Solved in 0.3.2-alpha. I am waiting for 0.3.2."
Another issue was, that Vidalia is explicitly not designed to manage a
system wide installed Tor. Vidalia can not start/stop a Tor instance, it
has not started itself.
Vidalia will also not be able to edit /etc/tor/torrc out of the box,
because Vialia gets started as user, while /etc/tor/torrc is owned by root.
I am not sure how to solve it best...
Running Tor/Vidalia as user is also not the best option, that would
prevent "sudo service restart tor" (probable also the Fedora
equivalent). Breaking "sudo service restart tor" and running Tor as user
is bad, since it can not be updated with by the system apt-get (or the
Fedora equivalent). (Imagine long running servers.)
I guess the best might be to have Tor managed by the system (apt-get...)
and to start Vidalia as a user. To edit /etc/tor/torrc, Vidalia needs an
exception to have write rights on that file. Vidalia's start/stop Tor
feature will break, I don't know how that could be solved. You still had
a Tor which is partially managed by gui and partially managed by cli.
Relaxing permission on Tor's data dir further for Vidalia broke Tor.
However, in qubes-os that all might be simpler to solve. Tor/Vidalia get
updated from dom0?

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Identity button for multiple TorPorts? - was: Review 
Abel Luck:
Maybe the Tor developers could elaborate on that?
The whole stream isolation and switch identity works very well.
You can open "100" SocksPorts (or TranPorts etc.). When you look into
arm, no matter if you have "100" or "1" SocksPort, Tor will not create
any more circuits.
One SocksPort with two different socks auths is actually (internally)
two TorPorts (circuits).
Or one TransPort with three different client addresses is actually three
different TorPorts.
Only if you have "100" SocksPorts and "100" client applications actually
using them at the same time, Tor will open "100" circuits.
All (dirty?) circuits are changed every 10 minutes.
I think Tor has some logic to remember, which circuits were recently
used and are now dirty. From testing: if you issue new identity, this
will switch circuits for all internal TorPorts, which are considered
dirty. Maybe also the idle one (clean) circuits get switched.
The ones, which were not actively needed recently ("100" SocksPorts) are
neither created nor switched.

think this is a good solution.
I don't think so. It's only a hack. Doesn't work on Windows. It can be
sufficient for distributions such as Tails or aos. For end users it's
much too hard to use torsocks for stream isolation. A clean solution is
much desirable. Reasons:
It has an IPv6 leak bug.
A patch flooding all console output (and therefore breaking applications
based on console applications) is still not merged upstream.
Fortunately intrigeri merged it into Debian.
Torsocks / usewithtor does not support choosing to which Tor SocksPort
you want to redirect. We need this to utilize stream isolation. I wrote
a hack.
It's far from perfect. Still requires a wrapper. How else people could
transparently use apt-get with stream isolation, without issuing
torsocks themselves. I mean, without a wrapper they had to use 'torsocks
apt-get' instant of a simple 'apt-get'.

Whonix is about explaining exactly this. Your own workstation.
Torification for anything and no IP/DNS leaks possible. (See security

The source code is essentially a collection of configuration files. (+
putting them all together unattended + distributing binary images
because there are so many configuration steps)
For example just go into the whonix_gateway folder. It contains all
configuration files. (Configuration files used on gateway and
workstation are in whonix_shared.)

to build anything selfmade...
Tell me what you need any of these for?

Did you read that link? Just use Tor Browser to share the same look as
all other Tor Browser users. If you use some speedup configuration
(polipo) you look less like others and are therefore less anonymous.
pdnsd? Needed for what? Don't cache your DNS requests. Most people don't
do it. If you do it, you behave different and web servers might detect
that and therefore you're again, less anonymous.

If I understand correctly, this would be like "emule regular public
network and high id over Tor", i.e. open a server port at an exit node
and let it forward through Tor to your Tor client. Tor does not have
such a feature. It needs sender and recipient to be aware of using Tor,
can only be done with hidden services.

Are you sure about this? Why not?
Confusion exists indeed. So much that no one else replies.
I don't understand that trouble with DNS. Can you give a *practical*
example, what you want to do?
For example: "I want to resolve .bit domains over Tor. On Windows XP.
What's the simplest method? Which method involves the least amount of tools?
What's wrong with Tor's DnsPort?
Tor can listen on specific interfaces. Examples:
TransPort 192.168.0.10:9040
DnsPort 192.168.0.10:53
SocksPort 192.168.0.10:9100
will listen on 192.168.0.10 only. Yes, but only on "one" port.
Redirecting traffic from a whole network interface to some other
ip/port, can only be done using firewall rules. Iptables on Linux and no
idea how to do it with Windows. Yes, that involves more software again.
Tor has no "create-a-virtual-interface" feature. Perhaps you could
create a virtual network interface, but yes, that again would involve
more software.
I think if you need to listen on port 1 - 65535 at once, you are doing
something wrong. Never saw anyone in need to do this.

anonymous browsing, circumvention and so on for the next years.
It's also questionable if the Tor project should try to get a big share

this opens up the project for a lot negative press. That increases the
risk for a new law to forbid the whole network in even more countries.

Bad. You'd be one of the very few people not using TBB. There are much

Answered below.
You're lucky, I've been working on something similar for a while. [1]
Tor Browser without Vidalia/Tor is used in Whonix on one machine. Tor is
running on another machine. Both machines are connected through an
internal network. Also fails closed. (The machine running Tor has two
network cards.) Tor Browser is configured to use a SocksPort listening
on the machine with Tor.
That is the same what you describe, just simpler. (No need to patch
TBB/Firefox, beside the TBB startup script.)
The startup script was modified only start Tor Browser, not Vidalia and
Tor. (Tor Browser = patched Firefox + Tor Button)
- Firefox proxy bypass bugs (ex: [2]) was circumvented.
- More advantages... [3]
- higher hardware requirements
- more difficult to set up
- ... [4]
Security comparison... [5] Attacks comparison... [6]
I'd rather recommend an isolated proxy design (Two machines, one runs
Tor, another one runs Tor Browser. Tor Browser can only access Socks
ports on the machine with Tor.), instead of a transparent proxy design.
Otherwise operating system updates (and other applications, software
updater you are not aware off) still use the same circuit.

On the other hand Mozilla Firefox + Tor users are not important. They

Hi Alex,
these are interesting thoughts. I wrote something related a while ago.
Tor: lobbies vs lobbies - Who will prevail?:
Alex M (Coyo):
Good idea in general. (Although I don't share your reasons for it.)
I am interested, where did they say so?
Why assassinations? I've heard the some mafia style groups have a better
method than violence. They catch a child after school, make up some
"Your parents told me to catch you today, I am your Uncle Sam." story,
aren't violent or threatening at all and go into some Disney land copy,
bring back the child afterwards. Not sure if that happens in reality,
but I am sure that works better than violence.
Other than that, it seems obvious to me that killing people isn't
effective as turning them around. Why wouldn't they rather use violence
to force them to put a backdoor into next Tor version?
As far I know no Tor developer has been harassed for Tor yet. (Please
tell me if I am wrong.) Jacob has been harassed like in a totalitarian
state because of his connections to wikileaks. I also wonder how Jacob
could stay so calm after all what happened to him, not being already a
broken man. I admire the Tor developers for doing their work in such a
dangerous country (US), knowing about waterbording and that stuff.
If that happens, that would be the worst case. I think without Tor
servers in the US and without the Tor developers, there is more Tor
network, since most Tor servers are in the US. Most other Tor servers
are in countries which the US can pressure as well. When the US decides
to take down Tor, it's pretty much over anyway.
Maybe they don't have to. When I understood Jacob in his speeches right,
he doesn't believe that Tor does defeat the NSA. Why should they break
Tor if it's an open book already to them already anyway?
Only in case they can't easily break Tor already anyway.
I don't see how that helps after hosting Tor servers has been made
illegal in US and most other countries.
Answered above already.
As far I understand, Dr. Paul Syverson works for Naval Research
Laboratory and can be told to stop working on Tor and work for something
else instead.
The others, already covered that above.
I value pluggable transports in general, but I don't see how they help
against the attack you are describing. Pluggable transports help
obfuscating connections from Tor users to Tor bridges. Bridges alone
won't create a Tor network. Who hosts relays and exit relays once Tor
developers are in prison, Tor servers get raided and/or illegal?
A nice to have, but I don't think it defeats your threat model.
How do you propose to obfuscate connections between relays and (exit)
relays? The list of them is public, that's the basic Tor design.
Therefore a state can take them easily down as soon as they made them
I don't think Tor can ever defeat your threat model. Tor is build around
the idea, that there are free countries where Tor is legal. If there are
no countries left where Tor is legal, Tor will surely cease to exists.
One important step to detect if developers have been threatened are
Deterministic builds. (Which would allow third parties to check if
downloads The Tor Projects is providing actually match the source code
the Tor Project claims to have used for compilation, or if they where
forced to include a backdoor while keeping the extra source secret or if
the build machine has been compromised.)
In conclusion, the threat model you are making up isn't unrealistic.
However, Tor can't defeat it by design. Friend to Friend networks such
as RetroShare could defeat it, in theory, all that's missing in
RetroShare are pluggable transports to obfuscate traffic to friends.

Griffin Boyce:
Indeed. One can even make its own (private) Tor network. It will require
a considerable amount of learning, though.
It would be interesting to see several competing Tor networks. May or
may not happen in long term future, if Tor can attract much more users
and relays.
Alex probable won't be up for creating an alternative Tor network with
that threat model. As soon as you host a relay or directory authority,
it's difficult (impossible?) to stay anonymous, you move yourself into
the target line by doing so.

Competition and more people involved always pushes projects forward faster.
Keep your time.
I don't know if Jacob has children and it's none of my business. Instead
of mentally breaking a mastermind like Jacob, they rather threaten it's
loved ones to make him stop working what he is working on it or to make
him even working for them.
Why it's not simple? It's well inside their budget.
Let's assume that's true -> no danger for Tor core people from the US.
What about other countries? Tor gives network access to many people in
countries who censor Tor. Couldn't they get totally mad if their
technical fight fails and switch over to a secret service violent operating?
If that's your opinion, all you can do with Tor is learn from it, take
the source code and improve it. Someone should lobby for a competitive
anonymity network solving all issues. That someone could be you. I don't
think it's realistic to see any alternative, better anonymity network
showing up. Demanding things is one thing, but who does the actual work?
I'll agree the law isn't necessary, it certainly makes things easier to
sell to other citizen. Making a law against Tor is easy going. A law
"hosting a Tor server = 1 month in prison" would already minimize the
amount of Tor servers.
I don't think so and I don't know how you came to that conclusion from
my writings.
Not sure what you mean, but quite sure you got me wrong. :/
I don't remember having seen such complete redesigns in any open source
project. People have too much habits and are too stubborn. It's much
more likely, that a new project will be created and handle your threat
How should that work? The IS the very advantage of Tor. The Tor client
has the list of relays and decides itself which path it creates. If you
know only a very few relay servers, certain attacks get even easier.
I don't find that convincing. Approaches like friend to friend networks
(RetroShare) with pluggable transports and creating a new internet using
wifi hardware seems more realistic to me.
Very few users will do that.
First time I hear that. However, that doesn't sound like something which
couldn't be fixed with a patch.
In conclusion, I don't believe any software can defeat a state who
imprisons and tortures every contributor of some anonymity or friend
network. Software is much too fragile against serious attempts to take
downs. Traffic obfuscation is weak. In your threat model the ISP is
certainly evil and logging big amounts of traffic. Once a bug or
weakness in the traffic obfuscation code has been found, every
participant of the network is known. Software can certainly play one
role in preserving freedom, not the only one.

What in case the directory authority is not reachable (censored area)?
Is the parasitic approach future proof anyway? Won't that cost the

What if the remote server admins install some "intelligent" filter,
which blocks Tor? (for other unrelated spam/ddos issues)
Why trust and get the time of some remote server admins who are not
really willing to run a network time server? They most likely get their
own time over unauthenticated NTP. Getting time from TLS is more a hack
than a replacement for non-existing tcp, authenticated and distributed  NTP.
Instead I can imagine a better approach. The Tor network and Tor client
itself are a good base for an alternative, safe, non-SSL-CA-dependant,
Tor-safe, authenticated time server network.
Parse Tor consensus approach... Well, what if that format changes in
future? Why not build the required features into Tor itself?

If Chrome OS where to connect to Tor because of the new time sync
feature of Tor, that makes connections to Tor less suspicious and adds

My point is, even if the answer is at the moment "we fail that test",
it's hopefully "possible to fix" as well. And, we should try to prevent
adding new factors, which could worsen the current status, if that
appears (already) attractive and doable.
Of course, the already existing (or new) operating system fingerprinting
by ISP issues could still get fixed when they get real world issues. For
example, Tails could mimic a mainstream operating system, by running one
untorified in a VM or chroot; and letting pluggable transports doing the
obfuscation for Tor traffic.
Potential censors, yes. Other, I don't have an answer.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Tails-dev] secure and simple network time (hack) 
Jacob Appelbaum:
Yes, but... While making this point up, I saw pluggable transports as a
tool which can be thrown into the mix and make this a non-issue.
(In theory obfsproxy and alike tools can hide the fact that someone is
using Tor, which will be required against trying-hard-censurers so or
so. This assumes, that pluggable transports will win the arms race
against censors.)
The plan is...
When using VMs (as most people do), there is still a host operating
system people start first - so there is not only Tor traffic. Tor usage
can be hidden by using pluggable transports.
When this becomes an issue, there are two workarounds:
- running Tails in a VM (naturally requires starting a non-Tails os
beforehand) using pluggable transports to hide Tor usage
- booting a second computer with a non-Tails operating system behind the
same router, wait a bit, run Tails using pluggable transports to hide
Tor usage
And one possible fix: boot the amnesic system, simulate "this is Debian"
(or other mainstream distro) by running it untorified in chroot or in a
VM; fire up Tor using pluggable transports to hide Tor usage.
The point I wanted to make is, I can very well imagine, not to fail this
test, i.e. pretending to be a mainstream distribution, having non-Tor
traffic and obfuscating Tor traffic using pluggable transports. Perhaps
it can be prevented, that tlsdate introduces new operating system
fingerprinting possibilities for ISPs.
I tried to picture solutions to that above.

I know. It's absolutely non-trivial. From my distro packager perspective
pluggable transports are just some magic boxes to throw into the mix,
which get a job done. Great minds do all the thinking and coding.
Yes, I wouldn't claim that in documentation, of course. When I said "Tor
usage can be hidden by using pluggable transports." in this very
context, I assume, that this magic box is working well. It's very clear
to me, that this is a very strong assumption and that this involves a
lot work done by other people creating that magic box. (If we wouldn't
make that assumption, we probable wouldn't have to talk about
fingerprinting issues.)
It's all about censorship circumvention. I thought, when we assume that
this magic box works reasonable well, it would be a pity if we now added
something which could render the achievements by pluggable transports

@_subject: [tor-talk] What's different in torbrowser? 
Martin Kepplinger:
Its all possible with some hacking.
First, learn how to start Tor Browser without the bundles Tor/Vidalia:
Then let system Tor listen on 127.0.0.1:9150 as well (because TBB
doesn't use the system Tor 9050 default).
For TBB Alpha:
 Deactivate tor-launcher,
 a Vidalia replacement as browser extension,
 to prevent running Tor over Tor.
  export TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1
The TOR_SOCKS_* variables unfortunately currently doesn't work.
 The following TOR_SOCKS_HOST and TOR_SOCKS_PORT variables
 do not work flawlessly, due to an upstream bug in Tor Button:
    "TOR_SOCKS_HOST, TOR_SOCKS_PORT regression"
     (As an alternative,
    /home/user/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/user.js
 could be used.)
 TOR_SOCKS_HOST="192.168.0.10"
 TOR_SOCKS_PORT="9100"
Probable not required for your question, unless you are going to use a
 TOR_TRANSPROXY=1
If Tor is running on another IP than 127.0.0.1, you could also use
rinetd to catch up 127.0.0.1:9150 and forward it to somewhere else,
where Tor is listening.
And if you are interested, you could also make TorButtons access to
Tor's control port (for new identity in stable, for Tor check in alpha
and for who knows what else in future versions) work.
export TOR_CONTROL_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export TOR_CONTROL_PORT="9051"
export TOR_CONTROL_PASSWD="password"
(Also requires setting the control port password in /etc/tor/torrc.)
(Not tested, should work.) Extract TBB somewhere. Use a small script in
profile has to be copied into the user's folder beforehand.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is Tor still valid? 
Because The Tor Project (TPO) ships the Tor Browser Bundle, which
includes Firefox.
TPO is being blamed for leaving javascript enabled by default. And for
not shipping a hardened text-only browser. And for not shipping the
most secure operating system (yet to be implemented).
On the other hand, if TPO focused on security in past at cost of
usability, the people complaining know maybe wouldn't even know that
Tor existed.
See this attack as an reminder and reality check. Tor is not as safe
as many people kept preaching. We need safer anonymity networks, safer
operating systems, more educated users and probably a lot more stuff.
To make it happen, it needs your contribution and/or your money.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR bundle on hostile platforms: why? 
Thomas Hluechnik:
How can one proof the absence of backdoors/vulnerabilities? How can one
ever proof a negative?
This needs trusted distributors shipping Tails on USB or CD. With a
strong threat model you have in mind, you can't use a version of Windows
infected with trojans and backdoors to securely get Tails. [Oh, that of
course also goes for any other Linux distribution. Whonix isn't an
Tails/Whonix/any operating system could be perfectly secure and so
forth. Without anyone knowing about it, no one could take advantage of
it. In order to get people actually knowing about the project, at lot
publicity is required. And you can't get this if users of most popular
operating systems can not use it.
Using Linux distributions inside Virtual Machines is one fine way to get
in touch with Linux. After users learned the basics and due to
educational efforts, they may get up some form of dual boot or entirely
switch to Linux. I think the hard way "use Tor on Free operating systems
or get lost" will attract less than more users and open up for
competition (forks) doing a worse job making it available on non-free
operating systems.

I wouldn't use fake and poor software in the same sentence.
Poor is subjective and may be the result of good intend and low skill,
while fake software includes malicious intend, which is much worse.
I also don't think tormail fails in the category of poor software or
poor service. They are offering squirrelmail and pop, and from my
experience, it works  reliable. (Not so much for mailing lists.) For
being the hidden service they are providing a stable service and I am
not sure how they finance the mail exit servers.

I don't agree, that tormail is trying to confuse users.
I never thought tormail is affiliated with The Tor Project. They have a
disclaimer at the bottom of their page and before I think any project is
affiliated with the original one, I check that with the original. That
is simply common sense. Not doing so is just bad practice and failing
into such obvious traps, they will mess up anonymity one way or another
Fighting anyone having the name "Tor" in their software or domain name

project with their contribution to the ecosystem.
And if you want stick with enforcing that policy, please inform projects
as you first notice their name, that you preferred a different name. In
the beginning it's easier to change the name, they are more likely to do
it. It might be initially more workload, but there are not *that* many
projects with Tor in their name. Waiting for a long time, then

We don't think it's likely your web site site will be censored, because
censored users don't have to reach it, so the censor doesn't have an
interest to block it. Only flash proxies on the free Internet have to
see it.
A badge doesn't use any extra bandwidth or resources on your host, so
you won't get in trouble because of that. But if your host restricts the
kinds of JavaScript you're allowed to run, then maybe.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Debian bureaucracy [was: Tails Mac support [Was: 
Maxim Kammerer:
As maintainer of Whonix, I also like this join this discussion. First of
all, don't get this wrong. I still believe Debian was and still is the
best choice from all possibilities.
I must say, I am sometimes also disappointed by Debian bureaucracy.
Two examples...
1) Tor Browser
It can't make it's way into Debian due to "no code duplication policy".
I couldn't agree less. This "no code duplication" may have been useful
when when disk space was expensive 20 years ago or so. By blocking this
due to politics, they increasing workload in a lot projects based on
Debian. ( Tails specific Tor Browser patches,  Whonix Tor Browser
download,  torbrowser-launcher)
The answer for such cases is "merge your patches upstream" - yes, but if
upstream isn't interested? Creating the patches in a way, that they
won't duplicate code, is like "10 times" more effort - and might break
if upstream changes something. Creating the patches is something the Tor
Project with full time employees managed, but creating them in a way
that upstream accepts them in a "if this mode"-approach is much more
difficult. And their review process takes so long, that it can never be
done. With this "no code duplication policy", Tor Browser, no matter how
many users it will have, will never find it's way into Debian. (Unless,
Mozilla somehow just starts to care.)
2) The MATE Desktop
GNOME developers failed to make their users happy when they changed from
GNOME 2 to GNOME 3. Many people prefer GNOME 2. Others created the MATE
Desktop. It's a fine fork of GNOME 2. They where willing to offer Debian
packages, actually they offer them in their own repository already. They
just got them into a state, that many people like it.
They didn't make their way into Debian, also because of the "no code
duplication policy".
There are other applications, which didn't make into Debian repository,
because of that policy...
In conclusion...
I think the correct question to ask isn't "does it duplicate code?", but
"won't it break something?", "is it well maintained?", "is upstream
generally ready? (not too many bugs)".
Having a policy is a fine thing. But after some time it should be
re-checked if the original reasons for that policy still apply and if
that policy is still worth to be enforced or if it does more damage than
anything else.
Sometimes it's better to start fresh. For example, Ubuntu started fresh
and attracted more users than Debian. Or Chrome started fresh and
attracted more users than Firefox. That goes for may projects. When they
start, they are great, but overtime their own policy slows them down.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Debian security / porting support and embedded 
Neil Williams:
I get your point. Generally, I understand the goal of no code
duplication. Sometimes it just doesn't work if upstream and alternative
upstream are too different.
My point is, in this case, what you propose, is only more secure in
theory, but not for the users who are actually using Tor Browser on Debian.
A big threat for Tor Browser users is, that an adversary compromises a
SSL certificate authority and spreads infected copies. Proper gpg
verification is beyond what most mortal users are capable off (just look
at the download statistics or try to explain that someone not into
computers), especially if you want to do it right with the trust path.
That threat is real, an SSL CA compromise already happened.
It is also my understanding, that security isn't a top priority for
Debian. Not judging my reading the policy, but my looking on which
security aspects people focus on. As far I understand, there is no
effective way to verify, that a binary package was build from the
proclaimed source code - not back doored. (By effective, I mean to
easily rebuild it and to come up with the same check sum.) For an
adversary, it's an effective way to target the build machines or the
people who administrate those build machines. And no, I doubt that
people running the binary packages in a debugger all day to see if they
have been back doored. That may be possible for some skilled people
after suspicion, but won't happen for the majority of package updates.
Deterministic builds are the answer, but I don't see anyone care or
talking about.
In the Tor Browser case, alternative upstream (The Tor Project) could
also be packager at he same time. I'd prefer, if the question, whether
the alternative upstream really lags behind original upstream with
security fixes or does a good job at this would be raised instead of
assuming that they automatically lag behind. "Tor has a staff of 14 paid
developers [...]" [1] (Ok, not all working on Tor Browser.) I think it
would be worth giving it a real chance.
In conclusion, from an outsider perspective, Debian users who are using
Tor Browser are in reality currently less secure, because they have to
download it from the torproject.org website manually and could be more
secure, if they could download and update it through the Debian mechanism.
And if the Tor Browser download (torbrowser-launcher) makes it into
Debian, that will result in the same practical consequences. Users will
have code duplication on their system. The torbrowser-launcher doesn't
solve the code duplication security issues, it only work around the
policy. - Is that really necessary?
As for porting, they currently have Linux 686, Linux x86_64, Win 32, osx
i386 and osx x86_64 builds. Not sure if their linux builds also work on
BSD. I am not much into porting to other platforms. I doubt that adding
Tor Browser to Debian repository would make it available to fewer
platforms than right now. So blocking it for this reason is only a
policy thing as well.

Do remailer already have exit policies?
Perhaps many Tor relay operators just don't know about high latency
networks but if they knew they were willing to run the software in
parallel to Tor (as non-exit).
Remailers need more up to date documentation and perhaps some improvement
as well. Mixfaster description sounds nice.

@_author: adrelanos@riseup.net 
@_subject: [tor-talk] On the Theory of Remailers 
Please don't easily dispose remailers and look at their potential.
High latency networks are not tied to port 25. They could use any port.
Even if the Tor exit operators don't want to be in an exit position for
e-mail traffic, they could still be a middle node.
Neither remailers are tied to clearnet spam. If we assume that remailers
can not be used to mail people in normal internet because of spam, they
could mimic "hidden services", i.e. internal mail addresses only known to
the people who should know them.
Pseudonymous reply address for remailers:
Remailers aren't tied to messaging as well.
Nymserver can also fetch websites with high latency. In theory high
latency networks complement low latency networks such as Tor and can
provide strong anonymity.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Gmail and Bitcoin? [OT] 
Yes, it's very difficult to use it safely anonymously.
I tried to grasp it. Here is my summary (a tiny bit Whonix specific but I
guess replacing the terms Whonix with Tor wouldn't be too difficult):
I don't consider them very anonymous.
Quoted form my Whonix money page
^a^ Cash codes are printed once bought and could contain a code tied down
to the exact shop location, perhaps date and time. I don't know if that
already happens. If so that would be non-anonymous if they also keep
camera recordings and/or bought by non-anonymous means (ex: credit card).
The country code is already encoded into the cash code of Paysafecard and
Ukash. A country code and/or city code already decreases anonymity.
^b^ Anonymous credit cards and gift cards are not anonymous if you need to
leave your real name and/or address or if you can't buy them with cash.
Footnote ^a^ also applies.
One can buy prepaid cards at a lot of newspaper stands, gas stations and
supermarkets anonymously using cash. In Germany there is a limit of 100
?/month due to the Gesetz ?ber das Kreditwesen (Banking Act)
Outlets selling cash codes (paysafecard, Ukash etc.) close to you may be
found with the "Find sales outlets" search on the website of the provider.
In order to a guarantee a smooth and anonymous deployment of cash codes
you should consider the following advices:
Refrain from checking the cash codes before using them. Use the codes
immediately. Due to restrictive security settings cash codes are blocked
automatically if they are entered from more than one IP address.
If your cash code got blocked automatically, you could try writing an
email to the support of the provider. If you provide a copy of that cash
code they may give you a new one which is unblocked.

Unfortunately, not possible. It leads to identity correlation through
circuit sharing. Won't only press all stuff one user does but anyone using
that router through same circuit.
There is also exit node eavesdropping and man in the middle attacks
(sslstrip) and accounts (paypal) will get limited if Tor is used to log
in. People who don't understand Tor basics shouldn't use it or have a good
chance to get harmed.
See TorRouter.
For that there is TBB, Tails, Whonix, Liberte Linux...
Tor Router could do that all. You could check, what's discussed, what's
planed and what's implemented already.
There is a open trac ticket about this issue in Tor trac.
This sounds like making it more complicated again.
It won't work in all cases. What if they have a SSL protected website as

I think the Tor Router project can answer this.

I'll make a simple example to demonstrate the point.
Alice lives in country with few Tor users. Let's take Uganda as random
example from the Tor metrics page. There are between ~40 and ~120 Tor
users per day from that country. [1] Alice likes to read a local forum
and she posts in her local dialect.
Behavior A:
Alice always starts Tor every day around the time of xx:xx:xx and checks
a forum and posts.
Behavior B:
1.) Open a Tor connection.
3.) Transfer some cover/dummy traffic. The longer the better?
4.) After some time check doing the stuff. (Ex: check mail, go on
irc, post on forum) - Or at some random days, not doing any stuff,
supposed to be hidden.
5.) Transfer more cover/dummy traffic. The longer the better?
6.) Close Tor connection.
Adversary skills:
- Forcing the country's ISP's to log when and for how long someone
connects to the Tor network.
- Surveillance of the local forum, watching the forum post time stamps.
- The adversary compares the time stamp with the the public viewable
time stamp of the forum post.
- The adversary can watch the amount of encrypted traffic between Alice
and the entry guard.
Isn't it significantly more difficult for the adversary to find out who
is behind Alice's actions, when choosing Behavior B? It gets more
difficult than just comparing time stamps?

China doesn't succeed to 100%, but that's not much of a win. Look how
many users used the Tor network before any Tor-network censorships and
how many people figure out using bridges. The goal of preventing many
people from gaining that information and slowing down the flow of
information works very well for them.
Don't forget the assumption behind Tor: there are enough free
countries, which tolerate volunteers hosting Tor servers. If that
assumption breaks down, Onion Routing doesn't work.
Also keep in mind, that there are no Tor servers in China. When the US
starts banning Tor, it will be almost the end of the Tor network. The
core developers live in the US, when they get told, to take another
job, it will be difficult to find new developers. Without Tor servers
in the US and a few other countries with a noticeable amount of Tor
servers, there is usable Tor network anymore.

Whonix specific, since the confidence of not leaking anything comes from
the Whonix design. Many other points are portable though, it also
includes using Voip clients/ZRTP.
I recommended using a hidden service as mumble server.
This is a general problem when using pseudonyms.
Yes, and a voice recording of yours leads straight to you (voice
recognition)? I assume the voice of every person has made a
non-anonymous call and been sampled at least once (PRISM), probable a
sane assumption. Comparing that with a voice sample from the anonymous
server, and its no longer anonymous.
In conclusion, I think the only safe use cases for Voip or Tor are
location hiding while not being anonymous; hiding who is talking to
whom; and talking to people you trust while hiding that you are talking
to them and your locations from outside observers.

They are neither interested in helping out Tor Browser by getting its
patched [5] merged.
And this is causing lots of trouble and additional work for many people.
Patches can break when new versions of Firefox are released, which takes
up time from TBB devs. Updating TBB is less safe for users, since its
not an automated verified process and very few people use OpenPGP
TBB can't become a Debian package. Debian's answer is "get patches
merged upstream" and Mozilla isn't interested to get patches in fast.
These policies clash. So just updating TBB in Debian/Linux requires even
more overhead, a separate updater. [1]
Maybe meeting them at a conference.
And when Tor staff reports bugs / patches at
 and get replies, communication should have
top priority. Answers within a week. Not letting too much time pass.
Anyhow, I don't think they can be convinced anyway.
"Almost 90% of the total income of Mozilla Foundation comes from
Google." [6]
Google is interested in user tracking to get money from tracking. If
Firefox becomes a privacy by default (no more browser
tracking/fingerprinting) it gets next to impossible to track users for
advertising. And if Firefox becomes an anonymous mode, google can't
track anyone and make no more money with user tracking. Mozilla isn't
going to get ride of its primary sponsor by destroying their business model.

I understand, that the Iceweasel maintainers are not interested to add them.
[1]: "On the Debian side, Mike Hommey said he did not want to be
accountable for issues related to the TorBrowser patches and so he does
not want to include them in the main 'iceweasel' package."
If thats the case, I could understand quite well, why they are not
interested. If they are only interested in Iceweasel and not interested
in Tor Browser, why bother with lots of patches, required for a
derivative project, which possibly break later.
I'd be interested, but that task appears too difficult and obscure to me.
Its not like not having time or being lazy. After all, I wrote a
torbrowser updater in bash [2] and Micah Lee wrote one in python. [3]
And Tails developers, as you know :), implemented their own solution for
getting Tor Browser patches in Tails. So much overhead.
I have a quite different viewpoint here. There are people willing to
contribute, but no one able to do it as policy dictates. Policy is
blindly enforced while saying "for security reasons". While in reality,
with a torbrowser-downloader like solution [3], security is actually
worse. Extraordinary problems require extraordinary solutions.

I hope you are interested in the results of a little experiment.
Q: How many users downloaded OpenPGP signatures with the old design of
download page? (You can see the design here: [1] [2])
A: 1 in ~30 users.
Q: How many users downloaded OpenPGP signatures after adding a colored
download table, which indicates, that http downloads without OpenPGP
verification is the least secure method, to the download page? (You can
see the design here: [3])
A: 1 in ~11 users.
Note: This is only an approximation. No experiment meeting scientific
standards. However, while the number of downloads didn't decrease, the
number of signature downloads significantly increased. Which is a good
thing, isn't it? Downloading a signature doesn't imply, the user
successfully managed to use OpenPGP verification or that the user
couldn't be tricked or just ignored an invalid signature error message.

I think the mailman interface, if you never saw it before, and never
managed to get through it, doesn't look very welcoming and newbie friendly.
In a forum, its contents advertise itself and they get well indexed by
search engines. Things are sorted by topics. For a mailing list you have
to click on archives to see if people are using it at all and about what
kind of topics they are talking.
High traffic mailing lists have the disadvantage, that you also need a
decent mail client (another question first to be sorted out for newbies)
and/or decent filter rules to ignore threads you're not interested in.
In a forum thats different, you only participate threads you're
interested in.
The arguments most times are (not necessarily mine):
E-mail is more difficult to register when using Tor.
More eye candy.
People can more easily make just a single anonymous answer or thread
without any registration or other trail. On the other hand, one could
argue, that its a feature of a mailing list, that it encourages
pseudonymous rather than anonymous use.

With one account you can use the whole stack exchange network.
Serverfault, superuser, askubuntu, Tor, etc. They support OpenID (many

For example general Windows / Linux questions can be moved to other
pages within the stackexchange network, see [4] for details.
I don't think so. [5]
Something like that. For example, serverfault has multiple tags (linux,
apache2, windows, ubuntu, networking etc.). If you click on a tag, you
may get questions which are of interest to you.

You can also get e-mail notification about tags. [3]

@_subject: [tor-talk] What would Tor v1.0 look like? 
These are interesting questions. Software versioning is difficult. Many
developers seem to forget, that version numbers are for users, not for
developers. Food for thought. [1] [2]
Many free software is still 0.something, while development still
finished/stalled for years, the software is very stable and used by
thousands of people for years. And on the other hand Mozilla, Internet
Explorer and Opera are rushing version numbers because some users think
a higher version number must be better.
Using the date instead of a version number doesn't make much sense
either. I found one comment interesting:
"So, do you have Windows September 12, 2008 yet?"
"No, but do you have Internet Explorer October 9, 2004 yet?"
I found the Liberte Linux versioning simple and useful, 2012.3.
Tor being 1.0... Tor does everything claimed in "Tor: The
Second-Generation Onion Router" design? Well, time to call it 1.0? Or
perhaps not... Does having small version numbers attract more
contributors and founding?
I'd rather look forward seeing something like "Tor: The
Third-Generation Onion Router", Mixminion / Remailer (high latency)
and alpha-mixing [3] getting implemented.

There is also a paper on about padding in anonbib:
See also:
Some terms you could use in a search engine to find older discussions.
host:lists.torproject.org end-to-end correlation attack

In *theory*, high latency networks can defeat it, but they come with
problems on their own:
 at lists.stanford.edu/msg00022.html
At the moment their is no low latency network defeating this attack.
Unfortunately, there is no real alternative to Tor (legally available
to ordinary citizen, defeating that attack, low latency tcp, access

@_subject: [tor-talk] Whonix Anonymous Operating System Version 7 Released! 
Hash: SHA512
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and
security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux
and the principle of security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible,
and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.
Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a
gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call
Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only
connections through Tor are possible.
Download: Users of Whonix 0.5.6 and below:
There is no upgrade path from Whonix 0.5.6 to Whonix 7. You have to
manually download new Whonix images.
Call for Help:
If you know shell scripting (/bin/bash) and linux sysadmin, please
join us! There are plenty of ways to make Whonix safer. We are also
looking for an https direct download mirror.
Whonix 7 Changelog:
* Updated Tor to 0.2.4.
* Installed obfs3 by default. (for obfsproxy bridges)
* New Identity button on Tor Browser is now functional thanks to the
Control Port Filter Proxy (
* Tor Browser is now the system default browser ( In addition,
when opening a link or an html file it will ask for confirmation to
avoid accidental linking. (configurable)
* Graphical Whonix-Gateway ( Optionally, if you reduce
Whonix-Gateway RAM to below 500 MB, let's say to 128 MB, you
automagically end up with the usual non-graphical Whonix-Gateway.
* Whonix now includes an updater. It can not be promised that you will
never have to download a new image for next stable releases, but we
are on that way. Interested testers may have to download images of
testing releases from time to time.
* Tor networking is disabled for the first start of Whonix-Gateway.
The connection wizard (whonixsetup) will automatically start to help
enabling Tor or setting up bridges. This is useful for people using
bridges to connect to the Tor network to hide the fact that they are
using Tor.
* The current Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) Alpha, which will soon become
the new TBB stable, will work out of the box in Whonix, even if you
download and install it manually from torproject.org. This is useful
for the case that the Whonix Tor Browser updater breaks due to changes
on torproject.org. Tor over Tor situation will be automatically
prevented on manual installs.
* Boot Clock Randomization.
* Time Sanity Check.
* Higher console resolution: 1024x768 (without X).
* Disabled the throw-keyids option on gpg.conf due to usability
issues. Enable it manually if you need it.
* Fixed uwt. To do certain tasks such as installing the Adobe Flash
plugin or running update-command-not-found you no longer need to
"chmod -x /usr/local/bin/curl".
* Deactivated the kgpg tray icon by default ( not perfect, but
less confusing, since it will now start in foreground by default and
no longer as tray icon (which was automatically and confusingly hidden
by default).
* Downloading Tor Browser and signature from idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion
instead of torproject.org for better security when run inside Whonix.
* Time Privacy wrapper (optional).
* Enable "apparmor=1 security=apparmor" by default (didn't enable
enforce mode or add any useful profiles yet).

You may be interested in Whonix (self-ad) which also torifies all

Maxim Kammerer might be, although often right, a bit harsh. I personally
enjoy getting his refreshing point of his statements but think he puts
off too many people.
The Tor Project sponsors Tails (see Tails's financial report) and feel
free to look around to what extend they otherwise cooperate. (You can
see public interactions on mailing lists, maybe IRC, Tor trac once
you've learned the names of the core people. No idea how much
private/real life meeting activity exists.)

New hypothesis:
This is an attempt to shut down the Tor network once and forever.
Might this be an attack on the Tor network with the goal to make it that
slow for everyone, that no one will use it anymore? (DDOS)
Doing this using a botnet and only taking up a portion of their
individual botnet member's bandwidth?
If the botnet owner would force their botnet members to use all of their
bandwith, the DDOS attack would be more effective in the short run, but
the owner of the infected computer might notice it much easier and clean
its computer. Using only a negligible part of their botnet member's
bandwidth ensures that unwanted connections go unnoticed for a very long
time, thus making this not a short successful DDOS attack, but an ever
lasting one.
Roger Dingledine:
Even more users. And counting. I think now it's very unlikely that this

Without deterministic builds, and TrueCrypt isn't deterministically

from source code. The ones who compiles, uploads and distribute the

infected the build machine with a backdoor are in position to add a
backdoor without the distributor being aware of it.
And even in the source code you can add subtle backdoors. Source:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Indirect Tor question 
Speaking as a maintainer of Whonix...
Before answering this, there is some prerequisite knowledge. There is a
difference between:
- Free Software and free software
- Open Source and open source
When I am using capitalized Open Source, I am referring to OSI approved
[1] licenses (by the Open Source Initiative). When I am using
capitalized Free Software, I am referring to FSF approved [2] licenses
(by the Free Software Foundation).
I try to prevent using the terms "open source" (which could refer to,
you can get the source code, perhaps for no charge) and free software.
The terminology is seriously messed up, but that's not my fault and no
one is listening to me.
Praedor Atrebates:
We're probably all hosed anyway. Already for other reasons, backdoors in
plain source code. (I will address the concern of about being
non-opensource mail below.) Another reason is, when it comes to C and
C++ code, even in the source code you can add subtle, difficult to spot
backdoors. And I quote Ken Thompson:
"The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally
create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like
me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you
from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind
of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any
program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even
hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs will
be harder and harder to detect. A well installed microcode bug will be
almost impossible to detect." [3]
1) Let's ditch decades of effort in writing C code.
2) Create an operating system with minimal C code.
3) Freeze the C code base. Only allow most critical changes.
4) Re-implement all other software in higher level languages. Accept the
performance penalty or wait for faster hardware.
5) Also somehow get trustworthy, backdoor-free hardware. [Really Hard (tm)]
I am not in position to suggest such changes.
To my knowledge, VirtualBox does not include portions where no source
code is available for download.
VirtualBox is in Debian contrib, because it requires a non-free
(according to Debian DFSG [4] and FSF).
The openwatcom compiler is considered non-free because it's under the
"Sybase Open Watcom Public License version 1.0". FSF says
"This is not a free software license. It requires you to publish the
source code publicly whenever you ?Deploy? the covered software, and
?Deploy? is defined to include many kinds of private use." [5]
I think Debian also does not use openwatcom compiler, because that
compiler is not in Debian due to packaging difficulties. [6]
According to the Debian VirtualBox license file [7], "Upstream provides
pre-built BIOS images which is used instead."
There is also a VirtualBox bug report "Compiling BIOS requires Open
Watcom compiler" [8], which won't be fixed, but still contains
interesting information. It says,
"By the way, we provide alternative sources (assembly) of the components
that normally get built with OpenWatcom, so VirtualBox can be built
without it. There is nothing missing, we even use them ourselves when
build the Solaris distribution of VirtualBox. For some reason this seems
not to be sufficient for all distros." [9]
I don't know if the Debian VirtualBox license file refers to this
assembly. The thing Debian (rightly so) complains about might be, that
it's not nicely-commented and formatted assembly source code, but
assembly binary code?
Anyhow. Realistically, lets assume it was nicely-commented and formatted
assembly source code. I like to refer back to what I wrote above subtle
backdoors in plain source code.
Your concern is a valid one. For too long, the rumor, that Open Source
provides strong security and prevents backdoors has been spread.
There is also just another issue. A non-deterministically build
operating systems.
Open Source does not automagically prevent backdoors [12], unless the
user creates its own binaries from source code itself. The ones who
compile, upload and distribute (also the webhost) the binaries could add
a backdoor without publishing the backdoor code. Nothing prevents one to
claim, that a certain binary has been build from a clean source code,
while the binary was actually build by the source code plus the backdoor
code. Also the ones who may have infected the build machine with a
backdoor are in position to add a backdoor without the distributor being
aware of it. Deterministic builds can detect backdoors. For more
information on deterministic builds and why this is important, see:
- liberationtech mailing list: Deterministic builds and software trust [13]
- gitian.org [14]
- Quote Mike Perry: Current popular software development practices
simply cannot survive targeted attacks of the scale and scope that we
are seeing today. Source: Deterministic Builds Part One: Cyberwar and
Global Compromise [15]
- Debian wiki about their progress and development efforts to implement
Reproducible Builds [16]
That's why I said, we're hosed anyway. Against an adversary with as much
resources as are available to the NSA, Open Source security is fatally
Scrutiny is a good thing. I suggest using the vrms tool to find non-free
software. [10] [11] Parts of this non-free software may come without
source code being available. From a quick curious look into the Tails
source code greping for "nonfree", I found "firmware-linux-nonfree".
There may be more good reasons to add such packages than against adding
such packages. (Because not adding those may result in such poor
hardware support, that there aren't enough users in the first place to
even theoretically provide anonymity.)
The development version of Whonix (we'll probably make a new release
soon) includes a check using vrms (while building from source code),
which provides safety against installing non-free software.
(Tails aiming to be run on hardware may not be so easily be able to drop
all non-free packages. It's much easier for Whonix when aiming at
Virtual Machines - I am not saying this solves the problem - it leaves
the user alone with the decision to install such non-free packages on
the host.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Should Whonix ship Tor 0.2.3 or 0.2.4? 
Hash: SHA512
I hope this is the right place to ask questions from a Tor centric
linux distribution packager perspective. Asking as a maintainer of Whonix.
Next version of Whonix will be based on Debian testing (jessie).
[Pretty much ready for release. This is one of the last questions to
be sorted out.]
Torproject's jessie [1] repository still contains Tor 0.2.3.25-1,
while experimental-wheezy [2] already contains Tor 0.2.4.17-rc-1.
Due to the botnet issue, 0.2.4 provides a much better user experience
than 0.2.3. Now I am wondering which apt repository should be enabled
by default in next Whonix version.
I could temporarily add experimental-jessie during the build process
and after installing Tor, reset it to jessie. That doesn't seem like a
good idea, because when experimental-jessie gets a security update,
chances are bad, that this security update also comes through the
jessie repository. As long as the Tor version in the jessi repository
wouldn't be higher than the installed on.
Tails will use 0.2.4 and I have no objections against 0.2.4 in its
current state either. But Whonix can't be compared with Tails in that
way. Tails is a Live DVD and has a planed and working release cycle,
while Whonix is conceptually an installed operating system and
releases are less frequent, Whonix can be updated using apt-get [and
time is rare, and no else willing to regularly create builds].
So when next Whonix version comes with the experimental-jessie
repository enabled by default, it would later be difficult to
downgrade that version to the jessie repository.
Another option I would like to avoid is uploading Tor to Whonix's own
apt repository. I am hesitant doing this, because Whonix doesn't have
any packages containing binary code yet [they are fetched from Debian]
and, because that could look fishy and because it add maintenance
burden, since I would have to keep up with torproject's releases.
None of these options looks good. Any recommendations?

Ask yourself, why does FSF recommend gNewSense? Their top priority is

anonymity/privacy/security. I aggree, that software freedom is

proven, that Debian, which is in my opinion totally Free as well, is
more anonymous/private/secure than gNewSense, but does not fulfill FSF's
high standards [1] [2], FSF would still recommend gNewSense over Debian,
I think.
So if anonymity/privacy/security is your top priority, FSF might not be
the most suitable institution to look for recommendations.
I agree.

Even using Tor Browser for clearnet activities would make sense. It

reduce tracking by commercial trackers (google analytics etc.) and this
has value in my opinion.

"Use Tor Button -> Preferences to set it Transparent Torification. Which

Linux, probably useable for Windows as well) should be used here.
As well as the TOR_TRANSPROXY=1 environment variable might be useful.
Not at all. As long as users are clear what they are doing.
Would be a great way to boost the number of Tor Browser users and
developers. Many users are interested to improve their browser
fingerprint, installing all sorts of add-ons, discussing this all over
the web forums.
It would be best if Tor Browser was maintained as general "privacy
browser", usable by clearnet/i2p/Tor/JonDo/Freenet etc. users.
Wouldn't be hard to strip Tor from Tor Browser or to make Tor optional
or to make the anonymity service configurable. I can't take
more projects, though.

Hash: SHA512
Hi Rusty,
this is an interesting concept.
Do you know Whonix [0]? (Full disclosure: I am a maintainer of
Whonix.) It is an Isolating Proxy [1] with an additional Transparent
Proxy [2] (Anonymizing Middlebox), which can be optionally disabled.
Rusty Bird:
What's the threat model here? As I understand, it's ensuring stream
isolation for one workstation while another workstation is
compromised. Please correct me, if I am wrong.
In comparison, Whonix's threat model is that applications running on
the workstation are not to be trusted. Even malware on the workstation
with root rights shouldn't be able to find out the user's real
external IP address.
With corridor, the workstations are allowed to contact any Tor relay,
The problem is, anyone, including adversaries can run Tor relays.
Since the corridor gateway will allow the workstation to connect to
any Tor relay, an adversary "only" needs to set up it's own Tor relay
and once an application on the workstation (such as the browser) is
compromised, can find out the client's real external IP address.
I am wondering if the advantages of corridor and Whonix can be
combined. Without running Tor over Tor, which is recommended against. [3]

I think the topic Bridge Firewall is also related here:
(The topic didn't move there yet, but it's all very similar ideas
we're discussing here.)
Getting the guard flag isn't really difficult. It's an documented and
automated process.
When using the public Tor network:
If TunnelDirConns is set to 1 (which is the default), quote Tor manual:
"...when a directory server we contact supports it, we will build a
one-hop circuit and make an encrypted connection via its ORPort..."
Some guards and directory mirrors are hardcoded in Tor.
See also:
- -
- -
When using bridges:
You'll get consensus from the bridge.
(Please someone correct me here, if it is wrong.)
Yes, a misunderstanding.
Corridor's advantages:
- - streams from different workstations can never share a circuit
Whonix's advantage:
- - malicious software on the workstation can not find out it's real
external IP address
I am wondering, can we get both advantages using just one gateway?
Whonix-Gateway could be modified to only allow connections to Tor
relays [guard flag, bridges, etc.]. But all the Tor clients running on
various workstations would itself be tunneled through Tor by
Whonix-Gateway. That would be a combination for corridor's and
Whonix's advantages. But it would also be Tor over Tor, thus
recommended against [reference in my last mail].
Another idea would be to leverage Tor's IsolateClientAddr option.
Quote Tor manual:
"Don?t share circuits with streams from a different client address.
(On by default and strongly recommended;..."
Whonix-Gateway profits from this. The problem is, any
Whonix-Workstation behind Whonix-Gateway - once compromised - can
claim to be another Whonix-Workstation, thus not being stream isolated
This could be solved, when there was a defense, that prevented
impersonating other workstations. VPN and/or Static ARP entries and/or
OpenSSH could be used for that purpose.
I wrote quite a lot about this topic already:
- -
- - Documented some workarounds (multiple Whonix-Gateways or using
additional (isolated) network interfaces). These are inconvenient and
probably only used by a very few people.
Considering Whonix-Gateway would authenticate Whonix-Workstation's and
thus better enforce stream isolation, would this be a substitute for

Interesting consideration.
You didn't imply, but I am conditioned to believe all Tor-gateway like

The nice thing about corridor is, that it's still quite simple.
Something I still have my Whonix todo list. (Providing minimal

Entirely untested! This is only useful if you have a developers mindset!
This is the first time .qcow2 images are available (as .tar.gz, qcow2

We have unfinished(!) instructions for KVM:
There are still a few blockers before using Whonix with KVM can be
considered sane:
Please help out solving them. Whonix also needs a maintainer to
support using Whonix with KVM.
If you want to upgrade existing Whonix version using Whonix's APT
Sorry, upgrading from existing Whonix version (0.5.6, 7, etc.) to Whonix
8 is not be possible.
Updating from the previous testers-only version 7.7.8.6 or 7.7.9.8
should be possible when you have Whonix's (stable) APT repository
enabled. See:
(Whonix 7.7.9.8 is the same version as Whonix 8, just a different
version number.)

See Physical Isolation users
See Changelog between Whonix 7 and Whonix 8
* Whonix is now based on Debian stable instead of Debian testing.
* In new installations, automatic updates of Whonix's debian packages
are disabled by default. During first start, users can decide if they
want to enable Whonix's APT repository or want to leave it disabled.
* Fixed Whonix's Tor Browser download and start script for TBB 3.5.
* Fixed physical isolation build script.
* Verifiable Builds. Whonix now has a feature which allows the community
to check that Whonix .ova releases are verifiably created from project's
own source code. Also made ade Whonix's APT repository verifiable (even
deterministic!). Please see
 for details.
* Made Whonix build script configurable (can now build terminal-only
Whonix-Gateway's and/or Whonix-Workstations; 64 bit builds and more)
* Improved Whonix News's security. All Whonix News Files are now inside
one tarball, which is signed. This stops leaking how many users are
using a particular version.
* whonixcheck's Whonix News download now checks if Whonix News are still
valid (currently up to 4 weeks) and therefore detects indefinite freeze
and replay attacks.
* whonix_repository tool now has a graphical user interface; added more
command line switches.
* Set default locale to en_US.UTF-8.
* Simplified custom user installation of TorChat, thanks to dummytor.
(Protecting from Tor over Tor.)
* Removed apper and synaptic from default installation, because they are
too confusing / have too many bugs, do not always work in all cases for
all users,  can still be manually installed if wanted, see also
* whonixcheck: more configuration options, any function can now be
disabled, this is useful for users who wish to disable control port
filter proxy, they can disable the check_tor_bootstrap function
* whonixcheck: added protection against possibly malicious strings from
check.torproject.org (in case of a bug, compromise of check.tpo server
or CA compromise), IP strings are now max 50 characters long. User will
be warned in case the limit is exceeded.
* Whonix-Workstation: no longer installing Tor Browser by default, this
simplified implementing verifiable builds ( installing iceweasel
by default, which can be used to download Tor Browser, added local
iceweasel browser homepage saying that iceweasel should not be used for
anything other than downloading Tor Browser, unless one knows what one
is doing.
* Removed galternatives from whonix-workstation-default-applications
because galternatives has been (temporarily) removed from Debian testing
* Building Whonix from frozen repository, from snapshot.debian.org to
make the build script more resistant from upstream changes and also to
make Whonix verifiable.
* The Whonix Team can now use separate keys for Whonix's APT Repository
and Whonix News.
* Added technical documentation about keys in Whonix
* new man page: man/whonix_shared/sdwdate.8.ronn
* Deactivated Maximizing Windows by dragging them to the top of the
screen to prevent users from accidentally maximizing their browser
window when they are using resolutions higher than 1024x768. See
 ;
 and
 for more
information. * added udisks to whonix-shared-packages-recommended for mounting
removable drives
* KDE settings changes, set to oxygen as suggested by scarp in
"[Whonix-devel] Plastique kwin style & Widget Style"
* whonixcheck: increased timeout for the tor bootstrap.py utility from 5
to 10 seconds to make it compatible with slow systems as per bug
* whonixcheck: Whonix News File is now deterministic
* whonixcheck: Whonix News added timeout for gpg and tar
* added secure-delete, because it contains sfill, which can be used to
zero out free space, which is required for disk shrinking
* Deactivated running update-command-not-found during build, since not
deterministic (verifiable). Manually running is of course still possible.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: removed the "deb
 tor-0.2.4.x-jessie main"
repository, since that repository has been removed by The Tor Project
(Tor is now in their Debian testing repository, which is already added)
* fixed a bug reported by scarp,
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_disable_kdm_autostart: was
not disabling other display managers other than kdm. Now using the more
generic /usr/lib/whonix/display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke.
* msgcollector: fix race condition not always closing progress bar when
it reached 100%
* Whonix-Gateway: Workaround for
Set in /etc/default/tor:
USE_AA_EXEC="no" Can be commented out when that bug gets fixed.
* optionally (opt-in) building qcow2 images, first rudimentary
implementation, build target (VirtualBox or qcow2 or both) should
probably be configurable in whonix_build script (
* Whonix News Blog Download / Whonix News: Whonix News Blogs (Whonix
Feature Blog and Whonix Important Blog) are now deployed over the same
mechanism as Whonix News.
* Whonix-Workstation: better implementation of dummytor using
config-package-dev (might break compatibility with Whonix 7)
* removed adrelanos' old key; removed
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_legacy (breaks
compatiblity with Whonix 7)
* Re-implemented uwt and dummytor using config-package-dev instead of
custom dpkg-diversions. Breaks compatibly with Whonix 7.
* Removed rawdog and pandoc since no longer required.
* moved misc scripts (Scripts for managing Whonix's offical repository
and Whonix News; debug scripts; developer documentation and deprecated
code) to * whonixcheck: do not show output of gpg for Whonix News verification
* whonixcheck: do not start whonixcheck, if whonixsetup hasn't
finished yet
* whonixcheck: new --verbose / --debug options
* whonixcheck: Check that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and
shooting their own feet.
* whonixcheck: Whonix News can now optionally be signed with two keys,
as long as either one is still valid, will be accepted
* whonixcheck: whonix_shared/etc/init.d/whonixcheckd: on stop, give
whonixcheck time to gracefully shut down so it can close any still
eventually open progress bars
* whonixcheck: fix, exit cleanly (close progress bar) when killed by
other instance of whonixcheck
* whonixsetup: start whonixcheck at the end of whonixsetup on
* torbrowser: hide output of gpg import; ask "Start Tor Browser yes/no"
after upgrading"
* torbrowser: added timeout to gpg to prevent endless data attacks
* torbrowser/whonixcheck: alternative method detecting locally installed
Tor Browser version. When $tbb_folder/Docs/version does not exist, i.e.
when the user manually downloaded Tor Browser, try to detect version
number from ~/tor-browser_en-US/Docs/sources/versions.; comment
* desktop: higher resolution icons for whonix_repository, whonixcheck,
contribute and donate, whonix gateway firewall, tb recommend, important
blog and torbrowser
* ram adjusted desktop starter: fixed lightdm (/usr/sbin/...) auto
* qcow2 images: added metadata preallocation
* qcow2 images: added "-o cluster_size=2M" to "qemu-img" for better
* build script: fix "sudo: unable to resolve host debian"
* build script: added --no-options to gpg to avoid conflict with user's
gpg config files
* build script: added benchmarking
* build script: whonix_build_both: support extra parameter
* build script: got rid of grml_config by using grml-debootstrap's new
environment variables feature
* build script: skip backup-img-after-grml-debootstrap and
backup-img-after-meta-package-install build steps by default, can be
re-enabled by builder
* build script: allow running build-steps.d/2400_convert-img-to-qcow2
without root
* build script: improved error handling, when error is detected, wait
until builder presses enter before cleanup and exit to make it simpler
to read error messages when building in cli
* build script: fixed update-locale bug
build script: Avoiding "perl: warning: Setting locale failed." as
suggested on  and
 by setting
export LANG="C"
* verifiable builds: new build step build-steps.d/2350_cleanup; Get rid
of /dev folder inside the vm image. This is only required for verifiable
builds. Otherwise this could be skipped. For example, "sudo
sha512sum /dev/xconsole" or "sudo sha512sum /dev/initctl" would run
forever. The /dev folder gets recreated by the kernel upon first boot.
* Improved messages.
* Lots of smaller fixes.
* Code refactoring.

BM-2cTjsegDfZQNGQWUQjSwro6jrWLC9B3MN3 at bitmessage.ch:
It is. From my experiences with Whonix user questions, I recommend to
always write down the connection scheme, i.e. user -> Tor -> JonDo.
Otherwise there will be confusion.
user -> JonDo -> Tor
For that case you'd have to configure Tor to use the proxy ports JonDo
is providing. Haven't tested the following [at least I don't remember
right now]. Try and tell us if it worked. Set https proxy, port 4001
in Tor's config file (torrc) (or tor-launcher settings).
And I quote "Please note: free services can only contact destination ports 80 and
443, which are used for the HTTP and HTTPS protocol. You can use these
services only for web browsing and ftp downloads. All other web
services you can use only with premium services."
Therefore setting "FascistFirewall 1" in Tor's config (or using the
"This computer goes through a firewall..." setting in tor-launcher)
would still be required.
And let me add, that only the premium users of JonDo can use socks.
If the above doesn't work, configuring JonDo to use Tor's socks proxy
should have a better chance of working.
Vidalia has been deprecated in latest TBB (but the new tor-launcher
addon seems to support changing proxy settings in Tor). Not sure if
Vidalia is able to change proxy settings for system Tor.
We tried to collect the arguments of all sides here:
There is no clear answer. It depends on your assumptions and threat model.
When using JonDo free, you'd have to limit what entry guards (or
bridges) you could use to those running on port 80 / 443.

@_subject: [tor-talk] giving up pseudonymity after collecting experiences with 
You may have noticed that I, previously known only known under the
pseudonym adrelanos, decided to give up my pseudonymity. It was an
interesting experience to pseudonymously maintain a Linux distribution
(Whonix). I've learned a lot during these ~ 2 years.
I didn't have too bad luck in the lottery of life and are won a
citizenship, which is at low risk compared to less lucky ones. Living in
a country, where pseudonymity for this kind of activity isn't crucial.
Fortunately, according to latest press, neither the US nor Germany are
killing their own citizen for criticizing "the system". That is, the
mass surveillance police state, the military industrial complex, the
system of economy, that needs exponential growth to prevent imploding.
And so it doesn't become even worse, and better for the less lucky ones,
it is important to speak out in public and to take action.
Staying pseudonymous for such a long time became more and more a burden.
For me, it is not healthy for psychology. When pseudonymously working a
a project, you cannot tell anyone about it and they're wondering with
what you never tell much. You need to constantly second guess every tiny
action. Concentrate on not messing up. Also you'll never know if you
already messed up and if "they" already know who you are. You only need
to mess up once, and you're always linked to that project. Lucky me, I
wasn't forced to stay pseudonymous for ever.
I am looking forward to continue contributing to the awesome Free (as in
freedom) Software community. Being no longer pseudonymous allows me to
speak at conferences, to attend key singing parties, to meet up with
other developers, to voice chat with other developers, to chat on IRC
without fear of leaking too much information, to be less paranoid,
sometimes even running searches in clearnet if that is more convenient,
and so forth.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Open source firewall. 
Citation required.
I guess Windows firewall does what it promises. You can have some
services reachable on lan, but not on wan. Which is the original purpose
of a firewall. You're probably looking for filtering outgoing traffic?
That is flawed concept. You can not reliably stop untrustworthy software
such as spyware, not to speak about malware from communicating over the
internet while having internet connected.
But before I reinvent the wheel demystifying the myth of outgoing
filtering, see this article, explains it quite well:
Someone should do it almost never works.
If not you, now, who and when?
I don't think so. On Windows, Windows firewall is enough. Seems futile
to me to invest into a closed source operating system. If you cannot
trust the foundation and also can't improve it, why bother.
It can't. See above.
That's how the internet works nowadays. Fetching loads of resources from
loads of different IPs. Some websites have more than twenty tracking
services running on them.
They have teams of people working full time on this. They're not
manually looking at all these connections for everyone, they create
filters to get rid of the noise.
Does anyone actually trust closed source operating systems?
Sometimes also no time. And often thoughts such as "Who would be
interested to break into my computer?!?", "I have nothing to hide!".
Most don't know what a back door is. When someone asks, "What is
best Antivirus, what must I buy to make my computer secure?" I don't
even know where to begin. Starting with compartmentalization, threat
models and security concepts? Forget about it. They want to have a
certain service, namely computer security and are willing to pay for it.
Problem is, we're far away from computer security as click, install and
subscription service.
All the best,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Windows firewall [citation] 
It has already been said, that firewalls by concept won't work against
attacks from the inside since there are too many ways to circumvent
In my opinion, Windows personal firewalls attempting to filter outgoing
traffic are only cash cows. Good marketing. No sensible security concept.
Let's imagine for a moment someone wrote an Open Source Personal
Firewall (application level firewall) for Windows. Now someone writes
proof of concept code on how to circumvent that firewall. A new bug
against that firewall gets opened. But... The bug can not be fixed due
to limitations in Windows API and architecture. And since Windows isn't
Open Source and Microsoft doesn't care about strong security, the
underlying problem can not be solved. The bug persists, no chance of
ever getting fixed.
See also:
Thinking about it some more... An application level firewall is similar
to an attempt to create a generic AppArmor. An application similar to
AppArmor, that doesn't need profiles, because it somehow understands all
applications it's designed to confine. We don't even have this in the
Linux world were source codes are available. Forget about even thinking
about implementing this for Windows.
If you are interested in innovative security technologies, look into
Linux, AppArmor, grsecurty, Qubes OS, etc. You could have a lot fun
writing profiles, which restrict everything but white listed things.
Windows is in this regard too limited. That's also why what you are
asking for doesn't exist and why no one is working on it.

I would consider it a bug. But since transparent torification is not in

When using transparent proxying, it currently is up to the user to (not)
fix Tor Control Port settings and access.
A lot progress has been made on these packages. The packages have been
created, are currently being tested in Whonix, seem to work fine so far.
But I don't think a lot people have tested them outside of Whonix, such

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions about NSA monitoring of Tor users. 
Mark McCarron:
Nice graphic. Looks similar for any country! Exponential growth of
debts. But not because mainly more and more money is wasted, it is the
money system itself that is broken. One of the biggest frauds ever. Who
has the right to create fiat money out of nothing? How exactly does
money creation work? Why is it that almost all countries are indebted?
And those not indebted, have minor funds in comparison to others debt,
don't hold the balance that others owe to them. If you take a balance of
all governments worldwide, debts are exponentially growing. To whom do
they owe the money?
In the fiat money system, amount of money in circulation equals debts.
Yes, even if you personally don't have any debts, all paper and book
money is only in circulation, because someone else made a debt. Pay back
a loan, and money gets literally destroy. If everyone could pay back
their loan, there would be no more money in circulation. One problem
with this system is, someone earns interest for the money in circulation.
So I can only encourage you to learn about the money system. Get
information from official sources. Read different opinions on how to
interpret it. Then try to conclude if it is a fair system or a fraud
system where few get richer at expense of everyone else.

Because it's about different threat models and use cases.
Usually bridges are used by countries that are "unfriendly" with US -
for example China. US services gmail / yahoo won't cooperate with China.
That may or may not be true, but for the use case at hand, that is
simple censorship circumvention it works.
On the other hand, your use case is interpreted by me as "I live in some
western country (ex: US), recently read the news, that using the public
Tor network will mark you as extremist in NSA database. Bad. Bridges
hide Tor, no? So isn't it an oxymoron to ask for gmail / yahoo accounts
then?" - Oxymoron on first sight, but there is none.
Using private and obfuscated bridges alone doesn't provide strong
guarantees of hiding the fact you are using Tor from your ISP. Quote [1]
[2] Jacob Appelbaum:
it. However, they do not claim to hide that you are using Tor in all
cases but rather in very specific cases. An example threat model
includes a DPI device with limited time to make a classification choice
- so the hiding is very specific to functionality and generally does not
take into account endless data retention with retroactive policing.

Seems like the honest way "no funding yet, may or may not work out, send
your application and quote so we can sort funding out" is less effective
than the usual "let's just collect applications and then see how it
works out".

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make Whonix really user friendly? Looking for 
Future Directions - Where Whonix wants to be in 2 or 5 years?
Do we want Whonix to be for average users or just for those with unix
Whonix is a useful tool for some already, got many fans. How can we make
Whonix really user friendly to allow mass adaption by regular people who
need anonymity most?
It seems, Whonix limits itself by its two machines design. [1] It's not
exactly simple and user friendly to say "you first need to get
VirtualBox, then import these two VMs, then start Whonix-Gateway, then
start Whonix-Workstation or use physical isolation [2]". How could that
be improved while keeping Whonix's design?
In the last days many had great ideas. One was to create a hardware
appliance. Whonix running as physically isolated gateway running on
devices such as Raspberry PI or OpenWRT or creating a Tor WiFi Hotspot
(a WiFi hotspot once using it, torifying the whole connection). The
issue is, having a "route everything through Tor" approach alone doesn't
make it anymore nowadays. If someone would run their usual applications,
such as their Firefox or Internet Explorer browser they used for
non-anonymous stuff beforehand over Tor, they wouldn't be anonymous at
all due to (flash) cookies, browser fingerpriting [3] and so forth.
Saying "plug this hardware appliance between your router and your
computer AND install this client package" also doesn't sound exactly simple.
Another idea was to create a Whonix Live DVD. But even if we managed to
create one, it would still be clumsy to say "you have to burn this iso
to DVD, then boot it, then start Whonix-Gateway, then start
Jason Ayala suggested to create an Whonix USB installer [4]. It would
still be clumsy (as above), but installing Whonix would get simpler and
more encouraging to use a non-Windows, separate operating system. We
then would have to support lots of different hardware, but additional
support by funding [5] this would be possible. Users still would have to
figure out how to boot from USB, which is not entirely trivial due to
different BIOS implementations. Also "secure boot [6]" won't make this
Cerberus raised the idea to make Whonix fully managed. Perhaps he meant
to enable automatic updates [7] for the host, Whonix-Gateway and
Whonix-Workstation. Whonix-Gateway could then be fully managed and
hidden from non-advanced users. However, there are some settings that
need to be set up on Whonix-Gateway, such as settings for Tor bridges
[8]. Maybe a Whonix-Host operating system could ssh into Whonix-Gateway
to manage it.
Or maybe while we're at discussing a Whonix-Host operating system, we
should revive the OneVM [9] concept? In essence, we're shipping
Whonix-Gateway as VM package, because it is a simpler and more robust
implementation to support a variety of different host operating systems
and configurations. As long as Whonix doesn't provide a host operating
system, the two VM solution is more robust. But if Whonix is enters the
next stage of evolution, i.e. by shipping a host operating system, the
OneVM concept may work better.
The idea to add Whonix to the usual app stores, such as Windows / Mac
app store as well as ?sudo apt-get install whonix? has been raised as
well. This wouldn?t make Whonix less clumsy (still two VMs), but it
would make installation simpler and more secure.
In summary, we're not sure yet where the journey should go to. We'd
appreciate the input of the community. Please share ideas on how Whonix
could become really usable while not sacrificing security.

The Tor Project has yet to make a definite, official statement about the
use of BitTorrent over the Tor network.
Quote Jacob Appelbaum [1]:
    [...] I'm not clear that it will harm the network if Tails includes
a BitTorrent client. I think that the harm comes when someone runs a few
seeding boxes through Tor and doesn't bother to add any capacity to the
network at all. [...]
Quote Andrew Lewman [2]:
    [...] There are completely legitimate uses of bittorrent over Tor.
I've talked to people who want to get their ISO of Fedora or Ubuntu from
outside their country, so they bt over tor to do so. [...] I'm fully
aware that the tor codebase punishes me for doing large downloads over
Tor, so be it. [...]

Satori could download from  It's not SSL. But
also not censored yet to my knowledge. For now, I would be mostly
interested in the automatic hash verification.
And later, when censored, would you mind adding third party amazon aws
links? [Bought and payed by Whonix project.] When someone else foots the
amazon aws bill, does size still matter?

Interesting discussion.
For more inspiration, see also The Update Framework:
Especially their threat model given inspiration what other threats one
could defend against:
Open Questions:
How to download and verify the host program in the first place?
How to download the secure downloader itself in censored countries?
How to download files in censored countries?
Torify downloads?
I think it would be best if such a tool was built into operating systems
or browsers by default. Otherwise there will be always a big hole in the
security concept.
It might also be interesting to see why Tor Project's Thandy project was
never completed.
Why make this a Bitcoin specific software? The lack of a secure
downloader is something way too many projects are affected by.

When the .clearnet domain authenticates/advertises the .onion domain, I
think also the .onion domain should authenticate/advertise the .clearnet

They are not. As I understand, The Tor Project moved along from being a
proxy to shipping application bundles. Because they learned a thing over
years, that just setting proxy setting doesn't make it.
Best there is is this:
Discouraged. Without anyone checking, that really all traffic goes
through Tor, there could be leaks.
Unfortunately not.
That depend on the software. In worst case "account name", "password".
In best case, "someone made an encrypted connection to drop box at xxx".
Analyzing the source code of the application (or the disassembly if not
available), using network protocol analyzer. Difficult stuff.
Using a network protocol analyzer.
If not using any VMs and such, usually OpenVPN connects before Tor.
user -> VPN -> Tor
Most of the time. It gets worse. When OpenVPN breaks down, usually all
applications continue to connect in the clear. To prevent this, you need
something like VPN-Firewall. (
(Full disclosure: I am the author of VPN-Firewall.)
Absolutely not. OpenVPN encrypts only between you and the VPN server.
PS: Neither VPN nor Tor can automagically provide end-to-end connections
to targets, that don't support end-to-end encryption (such as http-only
IF dropbox uses Tor, then dropbox should only see Tor. Not the VPN.
No difference. Eventually when you have rare target IPs that few people
are using, the exit node could guess depending on latency and
throughput, that you're sometimes using a VPN and sometimes not. But
that's difficult stuff I wouldn't worry about.
For serious analysis a Tor test network may be useful.
There is no such place.
Best there is is this:
I guess it's still the place where more geeks like to hang out due to
entry barrier for less technical people.

@_subject: [tor-talk] General questions about Tor proxy 
The discussion "Tor needs a forum" is old.
I see two problems on that topic.
1) Tor has no competition
("In the NSA's "Tor Stinks" presentation, they call Tor "the king of
high-secure [sic] low-latency Internet anonymity" with "no contenders
for the throne in waiting" [you find that quote on search engines])
Let's just say necessity is the mother of invention.
2) Perfect is the enemy of good
The people in charge of the decision on finally getting a forum
installed on torproject.org have such high demands for what
quality/features the forum must have... So their perfection got into the
way, they ended up not having any forum at all. You'll find existing
discussions on that topic in the mailing list archive as well as in
That's at least how I perceive this problem.
And what happened?
There is the more or less (?) official q/a style forum on stackexchange:
Bad choice, since hosted on a third party page. Bad for privacy reasons.
Also constant risk of getting that page deleted. Because the page has
only 2,3 instead of 15 or at least 5 new questions per day.
( Therefore not
fulfilling the in my opinion irrational "beta requirements". The risk of
getting that page deleted doesn't motivate me to contribute.
In my opinion having askbot hosted on torproject.org wouldn't be worse
than stackexchange.
And there is the unofficial forum:
In my opinion having smfforum, phpbb or similar hosted on torproject.org
wouldn't be worse than torforum.org.

What about "Community Libre Software" or "Libre Community Software"?
I haven?t found any statements of him why he is not calling it "Libre
Software". "Open Source" is a bad term as RMS agrees. "Free Software" is
too ambiguous as well. I never liked the term. People not having heard
about it have little chance to intuitively guess the essence of what
