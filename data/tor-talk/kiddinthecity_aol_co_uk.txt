Dear TOR users/developers
I am a researcher from Goldsmiths, University of London (UK), currently doing research on users' responses to Internet censorship in Turkey after March14 block of Twitter. I would like to hear of anyone who can provide me with some details, descriptions, and direct experiences on using TOR in that instance (I already have metrics from TOR project). Some of the questions I'm interested to hear about: How did you find out about TOR? Was it difficult to implement? What result did you achieve? Will you use it again? What's your experience? Etcetera....
MAX confidentiality of course.
You can find out more about me at  and my email on the top of this thread.
Many thanks
Paolo Cardullo

Thanks for your advice, G?k?in. I will follow that soon  .
?Confidentiality? was meant as an ethical stance of social research:  never disclose participants' details if they wish to be anonymous. some participants do not mind at all. you would be surprised to know how many Turkish VPN users have already responded!
Anyway, thanks again for your advice, I will implement that shortly.

Hi Mirimir
Thanks for your suggestion. I find this a bit too difficult for me, maybe you could help me? Or rather, I have published my public key on the default server. Maybe you could use that for an email exchange?
Alternatively, I can give you the postal address for my Department, but you will have to pay for the stamp!
All the best and hope to speak soon.

Set up a hidden service for accepting users' stories. Asking them to
email you is far too error-prone.
