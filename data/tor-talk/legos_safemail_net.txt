Hi all,
I'm late to the party here on this, I know, but I've recently upgraded my torbutton to 1.4.0 from what was maybe 1.2.-something. I understand why it was done, but the way torbutton toggles now is positively infuriating to me. I liked being able to click on it once and it toggled.
Like I said I understand why it was done so I'm not complaining about that, but now I'm looking to use a hotkey to toggle torbutton without having to go through the process of clicking twice. I can't seem to find a way to set it in about:config, nor is there any way to get to this in torbutton preferences. I googled real quick and found no answers. This is really aggravating the piss out of me and any advice would be appreciated. Torbutton 1.4.0 in Firefox 3.6.18 running on a debian derivative.
Also, is there any way I can get this onion icon off of my browser up beside the url bar/home button icon? I already have a button at the top that displays quite clearly if I have torbutton toggled.

Apparently from: tor-talk-bounces at lists.torproject.org
Looks like malware to me.
