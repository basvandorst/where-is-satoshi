@_subject: Unique properties and realtime entry-exit check 
Hi or-talkers, yet another issue concerning "without Tor" vs "with Tor". Two hypothetical examples: 1. I?m using the normal Firefox (without Tor) with cookies enabled to log in on Yahoo email to make some stuff as my real identity. Then I close the normal Firefox and start Torpark Firefox with cookies enabled to log in on another Yahoo email to make some stuff as an fake identity. Now the question is, are the cookies capable to retrieve some unique information about my computer, that later is comparable at Yahoo head quarter, to figure out this two different Yahoo webmail accounts was actually runned from one same computer? 2. The same base as in the example 1 above, but with the difference that no cookies enabled anywhere and the webmail account is at Fastmail with complete https connection for everything. Now the question is, are there some unique properties by my computer?s https handling that appear the same on the Fastmail head quarter to make sure the two webmail accounts was runned from the one same computer? In neither of the 1 or 2 above, is java, script or images enabled. BTW, I?m not asking to do some criminality, just for curiosity :) To go in the same post... It would be nice to have something att the bottom of browser window (only a thin line, perhaps in the Firefox status field) that on the left hand show the IP and country of at the moment active entry node and on the right hand (in the same line) have the IP and country of at the moment active exit node in the circuit. This line should be in realtime refreshing, one saple at second or 5 second or something.

Thanks for your answer, and I always do a complete "Clear Private Data" in Firefox or Torpark before closing and switch to the other. Then no cookies left over to the next. BTW, the question was more of a possible collecting of identical data by both cookie-sessions. Torpark is inside a own folder on my drive, the regular Firefox is in it?s standard default installation folder. On Thu, 6 Apr 2006 01:09:03 -0500, "Mike Perry"

Good work your great Torpark is, an easy access to Tor for people of an easy effort style (such as me). Now I have, to be a tip for your next release, in my opinion would be a very very VERY :) important implemention to give the Torpark browser a line down below (perhaps in status bar). As an fictional example here, thats the basical need: Entry: 123.456.789.0 Germany - - - - - Exit: 987.654.321.0 USA Or, as an "de luxe" version, compacted to fit the browser: In: Dallas, Texas, Blablabla Company - Out: Switzerland, Bern, Blablabla
Not necessary to continous sample when idle, but maybe a special quick button to click the moment before go any website or email, to check where Tor in and where Tor out. Another tip: Let the Torpark by default go as an "super security freak" configuration (with javascript turned off, no plugins etc). Thank You very much!

"Tim Warren"  said:
I?ll put it this way, if you are registered as your real identity on your bank (and not going to hack somebody else?s account), then just log in by https directly from your machine/ISP. No need for hiding by using Tor. Then about malicious nodes. Since the Tor is be open source, it gotta be decompilable reversing ingengeering to whatever anybody want with it, such as example tap out data in between itself or log what in is what out to middle node and so on. If not, why not? A soution could be to set up a private "Tor police force" and let everyone that want to be accepted as a part of the system, sign a legally deal to let this international Tor police force (how about the name TPF or ITPF or TIPF) at any moment without warning run in to every Tor computer node/router room and get full access to everything in it. Of course the members of such "police force" should be hand picked by comprehensive test (lying detectors and lot of advanced stuff) to be legitimated. Every aproved Tor node runner should then be very happy to be granted vit such visit of the Tor International Police Force, because if they not find a compromised, modified, malicious Tor software, You?r clean! BTW, now I?ve also received a maybe fishing from "Hokata Japan Ltd" about some business and money transactions. Funny or not, the IP was from Italy! At last, I?m considerating to switch from Windows to Unix (Linux) and hope it is user friendly with Tor. Anybody knows about it?

Hi, is there anyone having the same problem, or only for me? My setup is now a Torpark with disabled images, cookies and javascript. I somebody wanna test this, please do the same. To check the new Torpark (my is pretty old by now), I?m trying download it, but faile to success. At one time I get redirect to a chineese google page (probably because the exit node was from china) but usually the things going as follow clicking sequence: On the last page abowe, click on the link "Download here" that have the locatione of: Then you wait some seconds and again get the same page as the one you clicked from, whit the URL: Then click again and again and again and again and... so on, until you suddenly get another page that says: "You have tried to access this page too many times. Access disabled for 10 minutes. If you have cookies disabled or blocked from this site, please enable it." And that?s it. Since enabled cookies don?t fit in a secure style of internet usage, I must suppose this text is somehow an error, or should you really have to lower the browser security to get a security program as Torpark? That sounds not quite compatible in my imagination. Any third party mirrors? Of course I?ll check the MD5 as on real site.

@_subject: Torpark and security 
Hi or-talkers! I?m a fresh user of Torpark 1.5.0.1 (only as end user, not running a Tor server) and have a few issues here. First I must admit that I?m not some "computer guru", so perhaps my questions seems foolish to IT experts. Also, excuse my pretty bad english. My platform is Win XP with F-Secure firewall, antivirus, antispyware (freshly updated) with the settings at level "High" and the portable Firefox (that is in the Torpark package) now configured to no javascript. However, the Torpark is not istalled on some external thing, but in an own folder on my machines C:\ drive. When running the F-Secure?s Internet Shield Packetlog in time of staying connected with Tor, it shows up some strange details. One thing is that some arp protocol is going between my real IP-number and a similar IP-number (maybe the IP of my ADSL ISP, doing some normal things). Below that, on the loglist, is to be seen my real IP-number:port-number doing tcp protocol with a different IP-number:port-number (probably a Tor entry node). Another thing (and now the strange begins, I think) is that when select a logged row of outgoings to examining it in the detail frame on the log viewer?s bottom, then it shows up that my network card?s MAC address is transmitted out every time something going from my IP-number. Not only with arp to ISP, but also in the tcp outgoings to the Tor entry node. Don?t know if it stops there, but anyway it seems somehow unsecure that the MAC address is being transmitted, regardless if it stops by the Tor entry node and not reach the exit node. The log detail viewer looks as below. For security reasons I don?t write its content, only the frame around it. The MAC address begins from under 06 in plain text (before and after is other pairs), but under Ascii is only random garbage when connected to Tor. Offset 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f Ascii
0000                     (here is MAC addr) Next thing I?m concerned about is if maybe the Tor tunnel effect also works as a "pipeline" for hackers or malware attacks on the Tor exit node?s IP-number to be transmitted all the way into my computer, bypassing my F-Secure firewall because I?ve given the Torpark firefox access throug it and such as encrypted between, the firewall don?t take notice? Hopefully still the antivirus/spyware detect if some stuff comed in, but perhaps any "clean" hacker style tampering in my computer content going on undetected? What?s made me concerned about this, are that almost now and then the ADSL modem indicator lights flashing alot of time (more than before) but not correlated to the firewall?s alert log of blocked intrusion attempts, and even when the browser is idle. Also some more hard drive rattling is to be heard than before. As far as I know, I?ve disabled every auto-updatings in every program on my computer. On the network adapter is only "QoS Packet Sheduler" and "Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]" enabled (no "File and Printer Sharing" or "Client for Microsoft Networks") and a bunch of risky services I?ve also disabled. Maybe you know if that is a natural behavior for Tor/Torpark? Finally a couple of external concerns. Is there any possibility that a hostile ISP who already decided to look special on some particular users, may setup a kind of "simulated URL trap" that make the user believe it is connecting to Tor (or whatever else the user want to connect) and serve to the user an "image" of the supposed Tor server or website? One step further, on the Tor entry node, is there a possibility that somebody running the entry node, make some mod?s to the Tor entry node software in a way that allows separation of the incoming secure connection from the outgoing for next Tor server and there inserted a tapping af the data in unencrypted form, some sort of MITM "insider" attack? And of course the whole thing relays on how safe and uncrackable the encrypting itself is. Some people maybe know how to decrypt it, at least if they are in the right business. Just a guess.

@_subject: Torpark and security 
Thank you very much for the good answers! Another question, if an user wanna connect a https website throug Tor, is Tor then encrypting the encryption as well, or is it just letting through unmanaged, thus the SSL website will know the user?s real IP-number? Then I have an theory about how someone may get traced, without any big organization needed to monitor all Tor servers. This scenario depends on if the involved Tor servers make logs or not. An angry website runner (or somebody monitoring it?s flow of data) checking the list of Tor signed-directory for the IP-number of interest and there finding the email address of the Tor server contact. Then just sending an email to that contact requesting what in it?s outfaceing log of a given time (if the clock is well syncronized) or of a given exact size of data to/from the website?s IP-number. Then asking what at the same time/size shows at this Tor server inbetween log and the IP of the Tor server next before. Then again check the signed-directory and so on, until the very first Tor server log telling the user?s real IP-number. Now that?s a theory, in practise it will perhaps be more difficult as some (or many) of the Tor server administrators refuse to tell it, or make the logs dissappear if there was any. But the possibility exist?

Hi, another issue about security. When running Torpark, it appear in Windows XP?s default temp folder (Documents and Settings/.../Temp) as this: nst2E.tmp     <-this is a folder ~DFF991.tmp   <-this is a file Into the folder is this items: ExecDos.dll FindProcDLL.dll newadvsplash.dll splash.gif System.dll Now that may be due to I have the Torpark folder on the same drive, or what? If Torpark was running from another (temporary inserted) drive, would it then have to create the whole path to an own Temp directory on it?s own drive? I?ve not tested with Torpark externally. Maybe this thing is corrected in the release 1.5.0.2 (I?m running 1.5.0.1), otherwise it probably are a bug that can be taken care of in a future release, I hope.

Thanks for your answers. As you say, that execdos.dll remains after every session, in different named folders. I recently find out by that when once examine the temp before I run the shut down routine (computer cleaning and system restore) and the temp was full of such folders with execdos.dll. Another issue I fell over when occasionally taking a speedy look on my packet sniffer logs, was that a Tor entry node had send unencrypted udp protocol to my real IP, that?s in the ascii of the log appear (among random garbage) an email address, ending with " (but in capital letters with . inbetween). How should that be possible when all the communicates with a Tor entry node is supposed to be cryptoed? The IP of the entry node was "83.245.15.87:isakmp" (oh yeah, it had that "isakmp" instead of a normal port number).

Hi again, just forget to tell one more important thing, that is: When checking my Tor IP against some http IP checkers (such as  and similar), it give an IP that?s not my real and that is OK. Then I checking my Tor IP against another IP checker that is https and get another IP that?s not my real, probably also OK. Then get back to the first http IP checker and hit Reload and the first IP shows up as before. Then get to the https IP checker again and get the other IP again. The conclusion of this will be that Tor switch between different exit nodes for http respectively https connections. Correct?

Seems to be somehow random if it occur or not. Please test it all yourself, that who is interested, in different Tor setups and versions. The URLs i used when it occur yesterday and also when it not occur today, is: Then something else... Recently I?ve read a notice somewhere on the net about a computer make "records" of used domain name resolutions to have it?s own (faster) way to get an URL resolved. Is that correct, and how is that managed in Windows XP with Tor? Also wonder if this possibly record file is "live checked" against the normal DNS servers to get updated or not, and how to reset it manually? Thanks.

@_subject: Suggestion to beat the bandwidth abuse 
Sometimes the Torpark works like a heaven, with the only limit as my internet connection speed. Other times (regretably to often) it works like complete different. A couple of bytes in, half a minute wait, then one byte more, a minute of wait, then another three bytes... Have to close Torpark and restart it, sometimes several times in a row, before getting a decent speeded circuit. Probably that is caused by to many people sharing heavy files of warez, CD images and such. Therefore I suggest implementing some exit node file size detector, that cut of a stream after let?s say 500 MB, or already refuse the file in beginning if it detect it?s bigger than 500 MB. Maybe accomplished with an automatic message backwards from the exit node that tell the end user the file is exceeding the maximum allowed download size. That will probably defeat files of CD size (don?t know how much impact this have on the bandwith, depends on how commonly such files usually is) but still left very many possibilities for good downloads of smaller files, just cuts away the possible big abuse of giant files traveling across Tor for no reason of common sence, if that?s the case (you maybe know better)  will not have any impact on standard surfing usage, not even heavy surfing usage with a lot of mp3?s and even movies and big program downloads. The smarter one?s hovewer going to split the big files if they absolutely want them traveling in Tor, but the rest of "garbage usage" without particular thoughts and specific missions, would get rid off.

An alternative solution that work, is to put the whole existence of Win32.Trojan.Agent into another of F-Secure?s excluding lists, but this is for me by far passed the limit of common sence (maybe my guts is not good enough to playing revolver russian roulette game) so I have to copy with that warnings window clicking every time I close Torpark. Therefore, a good solution would be if either the F-Secure did investigate killprocdll to see if it easily could be passed, or if you at the Torpark manufactoring did some code changes that plays clean with F-Secure (maybee as easy as some unnessecary danger looking text string is into the file, I know some antispy progs react on such simple things, I?m gonna soon examinate it in hexeditor to see, but you maybe already know if so are).

Your security should be an overall matter, where Tor is only for your internet security. The approach for safing the computer place differ according to the environment (that you shouldn?t reveal here). Several floor above ground in a concrete building, or a wooden house at the contryside, lonesome or full packed with people around. However, a simple solution to know if someone whitout traces (or even after a regular break in) had tampered with your computer, is to mount a hidden surveillance camera exactly up behind a corner of the room (a lined pinhole type, not a cordless broadcasting one). If it?s your own house of wood, it can be done from above the inner roof. You then somewhere have a surveillance recorder that start with moving at the time you aren?t there. The recorder could be between inner and upper roof, or below the floor in another room. Be sure no visible parts is around and not accessible without open some small screws to reach it (if under the floor, you may place a table or a piano above). Of course it?s not good enough with a webcam by the computer, recording into the computer.

That I don?t know, not my country. I may add that if anyone try my advice of installing surveillance camera and hidden recorder in the roof or floor, it?s very important to make the place around clear, or else the equipment could get over heated and put on a fire (IMHO that?s overkill for get rid of a keylogger). The more air cirkulation, the better. If any isolation material fill the space above roof or below floor, throw it out before you put equipment there to make a few feet of free space around.

For your knowledgement, after my last F-Secure update, the warnings not appear anymore. Perhaps a result of your colleague?s effort?

Another thing, that may seems off topic, but isn?t because the structure of Tor system. I don?t understand why internet connections around the globe is possible at all, in particular with Tor that go between extra middle hops around.

Hi, to some https super gurus maybe on this forum!

When I check at the  trough Tor, I only see the Tor exit node IP and not my real. Same thing when cheking my SSL webmail accounts log of login IP and also in the headers of emails send from that https webmail, it only shows the Tor exit node IP. The question is then, are that perhaps any hidden information streams into the SSL connection, that is able to get the real IP, but only make the last IP (Tor exit node) visible to user? Or is it that simple, when the Tor IP is showed, then it?s the only IP the https website collect? Thanks for any answer of knowledge.

Keep cool men, I don?t think you put trojans in Torpark, Tor or Portable Firefox, however since I last week updated the antivirus and antispyware database in my F-Secure firewall, I always get this warning when closing Torpark 1.5 (build on Tor v0.1.1.12) but never when I start the Torpark. This warning appear even when I first mechanically disconnect the line from internet before closing Torpark, so it must be something already in the computer related to Torpark closing: Virus & Spy Protection has detected Win32.Trojan.Agent malware in your computer. It?s not possible to see into where the thing is (the warnings "Included in" line is empty) and when I then choose either Quarantine or Delete, I get a new warning telling this: Scan ended unexpectedly. There was an error reading an item. Because it occurr right after I done my weekly F-Secure update, it must either be an false alarme, or a detection of something freshly discovered that maybe not was detectable before (and in consequence perhaps not at the time when this Torpark version was created). Hope somebode find a solution, if there is a problem at all.

Thanks for all your feedback, and that "dead cow" stuff sounds really creepy. Someone have a good explanation? I?ll test that alternative .bat start Tor later on reformatted drive in resetted computer on clean Win XP install, to see how it goes. Concerning my original malware warning problem, after deeper digging I found a better F-secure log file wherein is to see this: C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\*****\LOCAL SETTINGS\TEMP\*****.TMP\KILLPROCDLL.DLL
User name and last folder are here replaced with ***** but the last folder temporary created by Torpark, always consists of 5 characters period tmp, that vary random for every time Torpark is running (note that, despite the folder name ends as an file extension .tmp, it are in fact an folder). My theory is that file "KILLPROCDLL.DLL" are what trigging the warnings. When afterwards examinating the last folders, this file is always gone. Probably it?s purpose is somehow to close Torpark, I suppose. Now the question will be if something had infected the creation of that file. As an test, I?ve completely deleted all Torpark stuff and then reinsert the Torpark from clean, but the same warning occurr anyway. I?ve also did a full computer manual search (whit Torpark closed and internet shut down) but this "Win32.Trojan.Agent" wasn?t to be found.

Do you mean the UK?ers had modified Tor to see everything, not only the usual unencrypted exit nodes? On Mon, 13 Nov 2006 10:09:39 +0100, "xiando"  said:
Shouldn?t it be some security precautions builded into the Tor system to disallow any circuit to have both entry and exit in the same node? In case, that would be on my (and probably everyone?s) christmas wish list. Good if it also disallow both entry and exit in same country. Anyway, I suppose it already are top secret tapping of all Tor runners in the world, serving it to a dedicated "antiTorifying" computer in realtime calculate analysis and present advanced graphical visualitions with maps, speedy zoomable to country and towns, with entry/exit relations and after a few picoseconds washing out percentage possibilities of let?s say this user in on Australia = this datastream out of Africa, to a level that in practise make for sure every one is identifiable at any moment (the rest is only as simple as to check the ISP lists of what IP is to who, a piece of cake for runners of such a tapping). This is for now my hypothesis. Btw, thanks Xiando for being a bright star of the list, I really like your revealing style :) Good work, though guy!

Yup, it didd da trick! Now I?ve added it to the F-secure exclude list (quite lonely there). About that "dead cow" thing, hope it wasn?t more than a grafitti tag sort of, or an old fashing "kilroy was here".

@_subject: To sniff the real data 
Maybe somebody already had a look on this problem? I?d like to know where and how to put in wich packetlogger to get as close as possible to the border of encryption at my user computer side of Tor, to watch exactly what?s going in and out (not only what?s visible in the browser). My firewall packetlogger only takes the already encrypted stuff that looks like random garbage, thus it are a little to late to see the actual content of it. In my theory, the possibility may be that if someone running running an exit node (or even a middle or entry node?) and tamper with it, this may be an firewall free entry into the user computer to hack it or do what ever whitout be stopped by the user?s firewall. What is your opinion about this?

Was?nt this solved several months ago, in Torpark (Windows)? That must be wrong. What do you mean by "Tor headers"? As far as I can see in packet logs, the "Tor headers" only appear when a circuit is established initially (such as in the startup process) and don?t contain anything about exit destination, unencrypted. The rest of session just looks like random garbage (encrypted) also with DNS request in it, not in clear visible.

My version of Torpark get it in one large file, "cached-directory" around 2400 KB in size. Did you refer to that one as inaccurate? If that?s the case, how risky is it to still use my old Tor vesion? I?ve tested a new one that get it in somehow different parts, but this new Torpark I don?t manage to run proper on my computer.

How about this; Using PGP or similar to make an encrypted file (txt or word or something). Then attach it to an ordinary webmail upload function, to send it over to the recipient that alreday are informed of my public key (and who?s key I have). All this whitout any need for Thunderbird or anything in computer. Anyboby tried this successfully?

Maybe a different approach, but how about this scenario. Real life practise, far beyond regulations and bureaukracy... Somebody contact his old fellow (out on a walk whit no bug mics around) saying: Howdoyoudo my friend, hear you was in some company with access to a storage of very secret certificates, huh? His buddy answer: Yeah! That?s top secret, peoples bank business would crash if that gets out, but sadly it also protect alot of criminals with secure connections, such as the Tor network. Somebody: Yes, it?s terrible with all this internet criminality going on. Hey, you know what! I?m nowaday running my own ISP and many of my customers are in fact using that Tor so I can?t spy on them. Buddy: Oh shit! How diguisting! Is there anything I can do to help you? Somebody: Ehm... let?s think... we agree about this terrible Tor network, so if you please just give me a copy of the secure certificate of the Tor "cached-directory" server, then I?m gonna set up a fake spoofed virtual bogus copy of that server for my customers, but with the real certificate, to make them download my very special version of a "cached-directory" file. Buddy: Wow, that?s great! Then when your customers try start Tor circuits, they get only your very special Tor nodes. It?s all in your computer. To fool them, you are connected to the real Tor network on the outside, but eavesdrops everything between it and your customers. How do you want it delivered? Somebody: Well, i?ve finally decided you may borrow my yacht for your holliday vacation, and just by coincidence you take some work with you and by accident you drop a disk behind, when you leave. Buddy: You are a genius! Thank you, thank you, I?ve allways wanna borrow your yacht, that?s fantastic! Later on, all between friends, more and more copys get out and finally somebody on the embassy of some very anti-freedom country get one, hand it over to their computer police, saying: Splendid, now we can execute internet users in millions every day! Now, what you think, fact or fantasy?

Maybe slightly off topic (btw, is "OT" = "Off Topic" or "On Topic"?) but because I newer had anything to do with eBay and still get this, perhaps other on this list also received it as some strange effect of being into this list, where any member see all others addresses? The following email appeared two times (25 and 26 octobre) sent from members at ebay.com with a subject of "Security Service Notification". Both have exactly the same content, except for two different email addresses when looking at the full headers. One ends with  and the other ends with  (if this is some mistake or illegitime use off innocent addresses, I should?nt expose them here). The headers also show different IP?s than the one in the email text. I don?t really understand what it says, but did?nt click on the links. The mail body is as follows:

Hello or-talkers! I see your activity had gone up rapidly since last time. Probably good, I suppose. Well... what I?m up to right now, is looking for the very ultimate secure email system that?s fully compatible with Tor and don?t require cookies, javascript and other things that somehow may be insecure in any way and may expose (or collect) the real IP of the user. Preferable it should be a webmail, offering full end-to-end encryption (no open email storage at the server) and free accounts sign up. Once upon a time, the hushmail had it (however with Java etc) but when I recently checked the site, they still want javascript and now offer antivirus checks of the content. How can that be possible if end-to-end encryption? Figure... There are others (for example cyber-rights, safe-mail and fastmail) but so far I?ve not discovered one that don?t require javascript (at least when sign up) except fastmail, who had been almost perfect if it not storage the emails unencrypted. About the usual garbage (hotmail, yahoo etc) I should not even mention it here. So, if anybody knows a webmail system that at least offer SSL full sessions, not storage it in open (readable for any snoops in the staff, or someone simple hacking the server), not in any circumstances demand javascript or whorse, and have a free account version, then please tell about it. Thanks in advance! "TP"

Thank you very much, that will do the trick I think, but still; have to get an email accout somewhere to put into it, to serv. Then to use my standard ISP supplied account would spoil the idea with anonymity and Tor usage, so the second trick will be to find an very best to use free account for Thunderbird, upsignable without javascript and cookies (the reason for not wanna have these, are the j thing may do to much, and the c thing may collect the "Computer Name", I think).

@_subject: Block directory authorities, is it possible? 
Two explanations: 1 - They need it for own use, field agents inside china to field agents in foreign countries. An easy way to not have to go by embassy that probably have other secure ways but more local and also more watched by foreign surveillance authorities. 2 - They have very unusual skilled people, find in their huge population, that have ways of cracking it or intercepted entry connections. When they have cop snapping steel wires by bare fingers and kids smashing concrete slabs with their heads and other almost supernatural features, no big deal if their headhunters find real super nerds. You know movies such the Rainman or the Mercury Rising? People like this may be in use there to crack Tor and then is a easy way to allow Tor to have it all going one way. Just my two cent, nickel or dime...
