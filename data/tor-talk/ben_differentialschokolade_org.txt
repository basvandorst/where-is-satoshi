Tor does not use your local address resolving facilities because doing
so would mean leaking the pages you request through Tor as DNS requests.
Also, exit nodes that falsify DNS requests like you do with /etc/hosts
will be marked as BadExit and not used as exits anymore.
If you want to block advertisements in Tor Browser, consider installing
the Adblock Plus extension for Firefox.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Exit Operator convicted in Austrian lower court 
IANAL, but here is how his lawyer and the ISPA lawyer explained it at
the meeting (I'm going to translate German legal terms as best I can, so
probably incorrectly):
If someone downloads child pornography through your exit node, you have
objectively facilitated the distribution of child pornography. That in
itself is however not criminal, you also have to act intentionally.
There are three types of intent: you could be acting deliberately ("I'm
going to run an exit node so people can download child pornography"),
you could be acting knowingly ("Hey, I'm gonna use your exit node to
download child pornography." -- "OK, fine."), or you could act
acceptingly ("I don't care if someone downloads child pornography
through my exit relay.") -- "dolus eventualis".
Because of the chat logs that were found on the confiscated equipment,
the judge found that the defendant's actions amounted to dolus eventualis.
However, even given both objective facts and intent, that makes an
action not automatically criminal. Additionally, possible legal grounds
of justification have to be considered, and in William's lawyer's
opinion ?13 ECG would be such a legal ground of justification (which
grants exemption from liability to operators of "communication
networks", an unfortunately not too clearly defined term). The judge,
not being familiar with the technical details and generally just
presiding over a lower court, did not go to the trouble of considering
any possible such grounds.
In order to force legal clarity, we would have to find a cooperative
Austrian exit node operator through whose exit node someone has
downloaded child pornography (not something you would actively want to
be looking for) and whose actions would also satisfy the criteria for
dolus eventualis. Only then would a court be forced to consider ?13 ECG
as legal grounds of justification. This seems difficult.
