@_subject: [tor-talk] Location App 
Hi all,
I am trying to create an app that allows you to choose a location for your
end point, to that end I'm trying to get the location and fingerprint of
endpoints from a torstatus server. I'd like to use something like curl or
wget to get the data.
I'm open to suggestion, and ideas on how best to make this app.
I'm not sure if the data I want can be extracted from a torstatus server...
so HELP!

I know I will need to supply the exitnode fingerprints, I was looking for a
way to get the list of fingerprints form a tor status server and automate
the whole process....

I'm currently working on an automated way of doing that... I have several
test scripts that seem to do the job, but a bit slow and they are a bit too
messy at the moment...
good luck getting this working it is a fun coding project
