@_subject: Tor on Windows CE 
Did anyone try to port Tor to Windows Ce yet, since OpenSSL 9.8a has "extended Windows CE support"?
Has Tor any other dependencies which might make problems?

Is it possible to access hidden services using SSL? Does this make sense at all?

Thanks guys for the speedy answers. I think I see now.
So there is not even one node which sees cleartext messages, not even the rendezvous point, because there is a DH handshake.
That means there is not really a need for another encryption layer.
And authentication of the hidden service doesn't make sense. You can already trust to be talking to this .onion, because you use its public key.
What would the benefit be that I can be sure to talk to some .onion.

Hi Lexi,
which crypto library do you use. We were thinking about doing a Tor port to Java using the cryptlib library.
Is your code accessible?

@_subject: Anonymity on mobile devices 
developing on a project which uses Tor, I hope to get some opinions from I'm working with the mobile business group at my university in Germany. We are developing a platform for location-based and context-based applications. We also want to provide security and anonymity to the users of these locaion- and context-based services. Beside using pseudonyms, we want to apply an anonymizing service like Tor.
Our tests with some quite fast mobile devices (PDAs) showed that Tor could not (yet) be applied directly on the client. In the first place performance of the PDAs is too low for the (many) publice key operations, and secondly setting up a circuit causes much traffic which takes long and costs money; e.g. the OR list is quite big.
So we switched to a different architecture: now there is gateway to which the user connects to and which does all the anonymizing for him. This means we have a single point of failure, but we only need to connect securely (TLS,VPN,...) to the gateway.
Additionally we want to enable the user to choose the way of anonymizing, e.g. using Jap or Tor. Because of this and because we use the gateway for some other things, we had to design our own protocol which is similar to Socks, but has some additional parameter for the anonymity configuration.
So our architecture looks like this: the mobile client connects securely (by VPN) to the gateway, then it sends a Socks-like connect request along with the configuration parameters to the gateway, the gateway sends a request to the chosen anonymity service (e.g. talking socks5 to Tor on port 9050) and after the connection has been established the gateway forwards all incoming data.
What do you think of this architecture and of anonymity on mobile devices in general? There was a system called mCrowds which implemented Crowd's Jondos on WAP-gateways. Does anyone know it?

I just want to ask for some more opinions. What do you think of anonymity on mobile devices and of this architecture? Who would you try to solve the problem?

Thanks for your contribution, Matt.
I agree with you, but may I ask why exactly the wireless connection (from the mobile device to the the provider) is the biggest weakness?
We wanted to apply Tor directly on the mobile device, but there were two 1. the device can't handle the many heavy cryptographic operations
2. the OR list is quite big and cost the user more than 1 euro each time
To improve our gateway architecture, I was thinking of the following (partial) solutions for these problems:
1. the mobile client negotiates a key with one OR which he wishes as exit node, he encrypts a single onion skin for this OR and sends the cell/skin to the gateway, the gateway adds the additional onion skins and sends the cell, therefore the gateway doesn't know the final destination
2. therfore the client needs the OR list, which could be stored on the device permanently; each time the client connects to the gateway he loads just the status of the ORs and perhaps some updates to the OR list (new onion routers)

We want to protect against an external adversary and against the provider snooping.
And we don't want the destination host to get more information than the user wants to provide, of course.
We are still considering where to locate the gateway, more precisely the we leave it open where the gateway is running. Perhaps it is no good idea to let the anonymity gateway run on the broadcast gateway of the ISP.

The idea was as follows:
A normal Tor client which wants to use the ORs  in the order
[Client <=> A <=> B <=> C <=> RemoteHost]
encrypts onion skin C, wraps onion skin B around C, and finally wraps onion skin A around B.
Each OR on the way to the RemoteHost unwraps one skin.
On the way back after C received the reply from the RemoteHost, C wraps onion skin C around the reply.
B wraps onion skin B around C, and A wraps onion skin A around B.
Finally the client unwraps all the skins.
The mobile scenario would look like this: [MobileClient <=> Gateway <=> A <=> B <=> C <=> RemoteHost]
The MobileClient wraps its request in an onion skin for C and sends this cell to the Gateway.
(Before that a handshake between MobileClient and C takes place to negotiate a secret key.)
The Gateway wraps skins B and A around the cell and sends it along the The onion skins are unwrapped at each OR like above.
Also the way back from RemoteHost to the Gateway works as usual.
But the Gateway doesn't have the secret key to unwrap the final onion skin from C.
The Gateway sends the cell with the final onion skin C to the MobileClient.
The MobileClient unwraps skin C and finally has the reply.
Actually I wasn't thinking of a different handshake, but just wanted to keep the client from doing so many public key operations.
So the MobileClient does only one Diffie-Hellman handshake with onion router C.
But if you have some good ideas for other handshake schemes which are lighter to process for the MobileClient, I would like to hear them.
We are trying to hide to which services the user connects to, and I think also his identity/location.
Getting the list of Onion Routers costs the user 1,88 Euro for example,
if he connects in Germany by GPRS which costs 2 Cent per KB.
And the OR list has a size of 941 KB.
This would be the case if the OR list would be updated completely each time you want to connect anonymously.
I hope my remarks are clear.

I like the idea of Tor as a OpenWRT package in mesh configuration.
