@_subject: AW: Circuit failure after IP changes 
I can confirm this problem for tor 0.1.0.17, 0.1.1.15-rc, 0.1.1.16-rc,
and 0.1.1.17-rc.  My tor server is running irregularly, just when my PC
is up.  Typically, after a couple of minutes (sometimes more than an
hour), I get:
Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the
outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
Afterwards, my local tor clients typically need about 50-70 Minutes to
learn the new IP address.  Removing ~/.tor helps almost immediately.
Just my observations.
P.S. By the way, once in a while I get the following message although
nickname and fingerprint are registered:
0/2 name-binding directory authorities recognize your nickname. Please
consider sending your nickname and identity fingerprint to the tor-ops.

@_subject: German laws and tor 
Hi there,
this question is essentially addressed to German tor operators:
What does German law state about liability of tor operators for
traffic routed through their nodes?
I'm hoping that ?9 of Teledienstegesetz is applicable which would
imply that tor operators are *not* liable for tor traffic.
Do you agree?  Any references?
Alternatively, what do you think, is there a possibility/threat that
tor operators might also be classified as "mittelbarer St?rer"?
(This is a term used, e.g., for someone running a public message
board, where anyone can post possibly illegal content.  Sadly, such
guys are liable for content posted by others...)
Thanks in advance

@_subject: Tor 0.1.1.20 servers no longer handle dynamic IPs? 
I've always had trouble running a server with dynamic IP address.
(With 0.1.0.17 I had to remove the client directory in ~/.tor to
establish circuits through my node.  This does not seem to work any
Actually, I don't think that my server ever supported a single
circuit for somebody else so far.
I'm afraid restarting doesn't help either:

@_subject: tor+torbutton without privoxy doesn't work 
What's wrong with the last link (imperialviolet.org)?  For me that
one seems to work just fine.  For German readers, more detailed
instructions concerning further browser settings and background
information are available at:
Just to add one point:  In my case, Torbutton configured Firefox to
use the privoxy port 8118 for HTTP, SSL and so on and *also* port
9050 for SOCKS...
