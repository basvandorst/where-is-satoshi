@_subject: [tor-talk] ARM equivalent to see who used my bridge 
Hello all,
Sorry if this was asked before but i couldn't find it here.
I have set up a tor bridge on Linux and want to know how many people
already used it.
I can find it out with Vidalia with one click ("Who used my Tor bridge ?")
Is there any option to make this visible the same way in ARM ?
Maybe its only a log flag i disabled (i currently enabled NOTICE - ERROR
and CLIENTS_SEEN because the other entries flood my log).
Any ideas ?
Thank you very much.

Thanks for your answer.
I think it must be the option, seems to be bridge specific as I cannot see
it on my normal relay.
I tried. Result is: "Usage stats aren't available yet" (after 2 d uptime)
So I guess this means no one has used the bridge so far ?
Anyways, thank you ARM team. It's more than just a "top for tor", it
completely replaces vidalia for me:)

I only see the circuits.
And on starting up I get a log message that ARM disables netstat etc.
, which i thought is normal.
I would be fine with arm not showing me the details but as the bridge
gets very little
traffic (according to ARM about 15 MB until now) my only concern is
that it is not working at all.
I think I will check the transferred traffic over the next days via
vnstat and compare it with the arm output.
