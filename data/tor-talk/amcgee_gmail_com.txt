@_subject: [tor-talk] OS X: Version Info + 64-bit 
I've contacted the OS X packager before about this, but it seems to
continually get messed up, the version reported by the bundle on OS X has
reverted to 1.0. Is there some reason why, that the issue of the plist info
version string being set correctly in the .app bundle can't be permanently
Also, I know that for some reason, with the latest version 3.5, the OS X
build is only 32-bit. Yes, I know that Erinn has said that they will
eventually get around to making 64-bit OS X builds again, but why has this

It seems to be the kind of query that springs from a nexus of ignorance and
paranoia, in the mind of someone too young to realize that the foundation
of the Internet itself was originally a government funded project.
That person sounds like a victim of poor education about the history of
modern technology development, that a lot of it came about as a result of
government money and research, rather than the contemporary libertarian
capitalist fantasy of it manifesting whole cloth from people's garages. No

people in the world actually work for the government in some capacity.
If you're worried about the integrity of Tor, you need to get off the net.
