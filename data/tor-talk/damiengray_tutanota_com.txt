@_subject: [tor-talk] displaying Tor streams 
I want to better understand behavior of circuits and streams, on both onion and client sides.
Using carml monitor, or the Linux onioncircuits package, I see circuits for onions that I connect to (client-side circuits). I also see circuits for onions hosted on the machine, when clients connect to them  (onion-side circuits). However, I only see streams attached to client-side circuits, primarily HS_CLIENT_REND circuits. I see no streams attached to onion-side circuits (HS_SERVICE_HSDIR, HS_SERVICE_INTRO or HS_SERVICE_REND).
Does this reflect limitations in the Python libraries that those tools use? Or perhaps in Tor itself? Where ought I look to learn more about this?

I naively expected to see streams in both HS_CLIENT... and HS_SERVICE... circuits. But after reading   more carefully, I believe that I understand. As Tor documentation defines "streams", only HS_CLIENT_REND circuits carry them. HS_SERVICE_REND circuits must also be handling TCP streams, because Tor is forwarding them to onion-service apps. However, Tor documentation doesn't refer to that cell traffic as "streams". Basically, traffic on all circuits except HS_CLIENT_REND is just referred to as "cells".
