Isn't it how I2P works? [1], with maybe the exception for bootstrapping where you need data from an existing (trusted) node.

Actually according to [2]:
"We currently have not implemented any particular technique to address Sybil, but do include placeholder certificates in the router's and destination's data structures which can contain a HashCash certificate of appropriate value when necessary (or some other certificate proving My 2 cents,

Even if there was some ways, who would then decide what a bad guy is and what a good one is, what is legal and what's not? What's moral and what's not?
Who? You? Your government? Your religion/belief?
BTW, Have you ever read this:

Hi Paul,
WTF god has to do in this story? We are talking real life, not myth.
Having said that, I think we all converge toward one thing: Nobody can decide what is right and what is wrong. It is by definition a biased thinking.
Tor is a liberating technology, it provides freedom of speech independent from whatever power-that-be, may it be a local gov, an LEA, a dictatorship, a well-
thinking "we're always right" dogma, whatever.
Freedom is an absolute concept, like Anarchy, you have to accept everything, from your own definition of bad thing to your own definition of good thing.
There's no compromise. Period.
What we have to fight is hypocrisy.
As a French national,  I can't stop thinking about "Tartuffe" by Moli?re, written in 1664 [1] and "L'Origine du monde" painted in 1866 by Gustave Courbet [2]. If you're still reading me, check Jacques Brel spitting on the army in 1966 [3] and L?o Ferr? singing about "pissing, ejaculating and crying" in 1969 [4] ...
Tell me again, what's right and what's wrong?What's moral and what's not? Where pornography starts and where does it stop? What is art and what is not? Who decide and who cannot?
[1] [2] [3] [4] PS: I used to run an Tor exit node, I then turn it into a relay node because of heavy pressure from the "We are the law" mother fuckers. I had to deal with DDOS attack report, network scanning complains, "illegal" content access, random insults in random "social media" places, and the list goes on and on... But I will strike back, fuck them! DEEP! Mais, la solitude...

Lol! That the same kind of arguments the proponents of death penalty use ... Justifying the worst using treat and fear as a sole argument.
