@_subject: [tor-talk] What happened to Tormail? 
Ever since Tor got upgraded to a new version I have been unable to
retrieve my Tormail email via Thunderbird or go to the Tormail web
interface via the web. Any thoughts? I'm sure I have email waiting and I
can't get to it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is Tor still valid? 
I'm curious as to why everyone is so intent on blaming Tor itself? Tor
was not exploited. It was a hole in FF 17 in conjunction with the
application running behind the hidden service. It's like saying "My car
got a flat tire! Should I ever drive again?" I agree that the exploit
was a bad one and in turn it's a big security issue. But if we're going
to point fingers let's not point at Tor. Let's focus on the underlying
issue(s) that caused this to happen. FF 17 was the target, not Tor.
Mozilla has addressed the issue. How did the exploit occur? Let's look
at the application(s) that were running behind the hidden service.

It they are having communication problems because Tormail is down then

@_subject: [tor-talk] Simple Question 
If I run Tor through a VPN and set it as a exit node will it appear that
the exit is located at my true IP address or the IP address of the exit
point of the VPN? I'm using PIA as the VPN client.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Running an exit node thru a VPN 
Hash: SHA1
Hello Folks!
I have excellent news! My VPN provider has sent me email as well as a
FAX granting me specific permission to run a TOR exit node through
their VPN service! They have no problems with it. So my next question
is where is the best place for me to set the VPN exit point? Where do
we need it the most? The choices are:
Various places in the US
Various places in the UK
Or does it even matter? Should I just pick one and go?
Are there any recommendations on port-blocking to minimize grief?

This may not work. I can open an exit relay using my normal IP address
on the router with no VPN active. All works well and it gets published.
But if I try to run it through a VPN the Tor client will eventually
connect but the logs show that it never gets past
"Oct 08 11:31:56.073 [Notice] Now checking whether ORPort
xx.xx.xx.xx:443 and DirPort xx.xx.xxx.xx:9030 are reachable... (this may
take up to 20 minutes -- look for log messages indicating success)"
I've waited well over an hour for this phase to complete. Does anyone
have any ideas what to try next? Again I'm using privateinternetaccess.com.

@_subject: [tor-talk] More Questions 
Hello Everyone!
Ok! I've conquered the issues getting port 443 to map to a forwarded
port. It turns out that only certain VPN gateways support
port-forwarding. So I've changed things around so now Orport is
forwarded to the VPN and I can "hear" it according to the logs. But what
about Dirport? I'm only allowed a single port forward. Does the fact
that I can't port forward 9030 cause the network decline me as a exit
node? Do I need to be listed in order to be nominated? If so I guess
this experiment is bust.
Any comments are welcome.

So if I can live without Dirport then I guess I have an exit node!

And another nicety is that I can change the exit node on a whim. All I
need to do is select a different forwarding VPN and point there. Right
now I have it set for Toronto Canada because they have the best
published bandwidth. But I can make my node report that it is in Romania
if needed. :)

Well when I signed up for the service I used Tor to get to their
website. I paid for the service for a year using Bitcoin. I used shared
sending on the Bitcoin so the path would be harder to detect. Finally,
the email address I used to register the account is a Bitmessage address
that I only access via Tor. I used a VPN solution because I multiple
devices that can benefit from using a VPN.
It's not perfect but it ain't too bad either.

I've been using them for a month so far. I really like the service and
even though they log for 2 weeks I use the VPN to enter the Tor

Wow! Someone sure has their panties in a twist! You're reply was 3 times longer than the original post. Also you are FUDing the group. Can you please provide any proof whatsoever of your claims as to the new DOGED being a scam? Your attacks are baseless.
All I see is that you are a self-appointed "sheriff" to the group. I didn't ask for or need your "protection".
I'm not defending DOGED but I DO feel that any senseless attacks against any poster to this group are unwarranted.

Gee... That's a tough question. How hard is it to catch the flu? How
hard is it to get hit by a car? It depends on who your ISP is, what is
specified in their TOS, what monitoring equipment is located at the
particular node they are connected to, what the courts have authorized
them to monitor, how interested they are in investing the time and money
in monitoring you, etc.

I just set up a new hidden service for Tor. I'd like to make it

Actually I've been doing exactly that for some time now. I rent a VPS
instance for $5/mo and host my own email server using iRedmail, Prosody
for XMPP, and a Dash wallet all with hidden services on all the
necessary ports (110, 143, 587, 9999 and others). I connect to my mail
server to the hidden services ports and all that good stuff.
I'd be happy to help anyone reproduce what I've done on their own
instance if interested.

Hello Everyone!
      About once a week I go in search of TOR hidden services that may be of interest to me. I found one this morning that I think is really great! I purchased a Ebook reader a couple of weeks ago and have been looking for sites to download books on the cheap (free). I found The Reading Room this morning at  I don't usually promote ANY website but I think whoever did this site deserves a pat on the back (or a donation). I downloaded several Ebooks with no problems.
      Pardon my posting this if you are offended but I'm SO happy to find a website that will help feed my Ebook addiction!
