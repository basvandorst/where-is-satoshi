I could mention JAP[1], and that it supports TOR[2].
You should mention it because of the following two statements on
their site:
"AP ist eine Entwicklung im Projekt Anonymit?t im Internet, das von
der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft und vom Bundesministerium f?r
Wirtschaft und Technologie (BmWi) gef?rdert wird. Das Projekt
arbeitet eng mit dem Unabh?ngigen Landeszentrum f?r den Datenschutz
Schleswig-Holstein zusammen. Mehr ?ber den Datenschutz erfahren Sie
auch im Virtuellen Datenschutzb?ro." (bottom of the site)
"Anonymity is not a crime"(top of the site)
1.) 2.)

@_subject: Analyzing TOR-exitnodes for anomalies 
I don't have Vidalia, so I wasn't able to find out which exit-node I
used, but I found something really interesting. "wiki.noreply.org"
and "wiki.ubuntuusers.de" got replaced by
I just saw a empty page, but the sourcecode was:
Because I use NoScript with Firefox it was an empty page for me. But
the page "forum.ubuntuusers.de", " and
" weren't modified in any (visible) way. Some more
tests: https to the corrupted pages resulted in the 404 error. Going
to " instead of "wiki." resulted in the normal pages. And after
a while, I got advertising instead of empty pages. The URL was no
longer changed but exactly what I typed in("
and " The site for noreply.org had
advertising fo the keywords "homes, for, sale, apartments, dating,
services, chat, rooms, airline, tickets" and the one for ubuntuusers
with the keywords "ubuntu, dedicated, linux, server, training,
operating, system, fedora, web, hosting". My Firefox made all
DNS-Requests through TOR. After a while, "wiki.noreply.org" appeared
normal but "wiki.ubuntuusers.de" was still advertising for a while.
What information are important for you to figure out what's going
on? (If it happens again)
