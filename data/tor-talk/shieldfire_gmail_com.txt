It's not free, but anyway - Just fyi.
Else I was planning on setting up Kolab on my own server but it is simply not allowing me to do it as the DS installation dies every time I try =(

Thanks, it's now up and running.
Thought I had actually installed tor that way, but obviously had too many beers yesterday ...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Performance 
I've set up a Tor and Privoxy chain for our organisation, especially
for our courntry offices, of which some work in high risk countries.
After some brief tests I notice performance issues (it's somewhat slow
opening new pages). is there any suggestions for performance
improvements that is generally agreed on?

Basically this (or Firefox, or Chrome as it might be). This is the
scenario for our office in Stockholm, where the main part of our users
are. For the users in our foreign offices the Torbrowser (which may or
may not be considered hideously slow) is obviously an obvious
Also, we are considering running (a) hidden service(s) on the server
in the future.
Is there a document somewhere that describes the differences between
what I've been doing and using the Torbrowser?

Apart from the quoted docs, I was more thinking a detailed
how-to/why-for kindof thing.

I am planning to use it as a proxy with services for the offices. Not
as a VPN to our own office.
The thing is that the offices almost totally lack any local IT
resources and expertise. They are also situated in countries, or work
with countries that are Democracy and/or Human Rights challenged, or
with stone age laws regarding Sexual and Reproductive Health or
vulnerable to third party military forces. And so on.
Therefore there are reasons to protect the browsing habits of the local offices.

The above may also relate to our partners, which definately shouldn't
access our office through VPN.

Considering the responses in this thread, I am now testing the Tor BB.
However the startup time for this is monstruous. Running through the
initial setup routine, the thing just seems to hang on connecting to
Tor network. What could be wrong?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden services, what is recommended 
I've been approached by some people at our office on IT security
issues. Our organisation is increasing our cooperation with partners
in "democratically challenged" countries and regions, so the awareness
is (finally) rising.
Today I've had a conversation with colleague regarding email
encryption, encrypted telephony and hidden services on the Tor
network. In regards to the latter, what - in your opinion - would be
suitable services to put on Tor (.onion) sites? Would you for example
put PGP keys exchanges on there? There might be interest in running
chat or other communications or document sharing.
Any comments welcome.

Which would too a part describe our organisation too ... good to know
it's being done.
We run an ownCloud server so I have experience with that. Unless
anyone knows anything to deter me I'd use that, but still, again, good
to know it's being done!
We're pretty small so it might work (150 in organisation + partners
then and not many would be using it at the same time) - only
experience I have with Mumble though is as a game communication tool
for Eve Online =)
Thanks for your thoughts!

@_subject: [tor-talk] hidden key server access 
I've set up a hidden key server on Tor.
I can access it well enough if I use Lynx on the local machine, but
from an external browser accessing port 11371 I get "Firefox can't
establish a connection to the server at ADDRESS" and "The site could
be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments."
What should I check first?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fail to connect to hidden service 
Apologies if this is doubled - got a weird error on first attempt.
I've setup a key server on Tor.
After installation I manage to connect to it using Lynx on the local
machine (lynx localhost:11371 gets me to the intended page). However
when trying to access it from  the network I get "Unable to connect
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ADDRESS" when
using the Tor Browser.
The main address (:80) shows the site as expected.
What should I check first to get this working?

Now we changed the public (not internal) IP address on the firewall
through which access to the Tor service is NAT-ed. The internal
address is unchanged, confirming that the relevant ports are open
correctly. Now I keep getting "unable to socks5-forward your request
ADDRESS through 127.0.0.1: SOCKS5 host unreachable" even on the
standard :80 port that was working earlier.
I've started tor, privoxy and the web server by now.
Any suggestions on what I am missing here? (I think I've been
tinkering with this for a tad too long).

I use Privoxy for users who don't want to use the Tor Browser. We are
a very mixed bunch of people here, and using the Tor browser may be an
insurmountable obstacle for some.
I'll disable it as a test tomorrow.

Finally, I found the source of my incompetence now it works.
Problem was in the torrc file: it lacked a HiddenServicePort stanza
for the service. ..... =/
Adding it, restarting the tor and service and now it is up and
accessible for the world at large.
Thanks for your time though =)

@_subject: [tor-talk] socks connect 
I've been trying to connect to a hidden IRC server using Pidgin and irssi.
I can connect using
torify irssi
torify pidgin
then connecting to the server, but setting up a direct connection
through socks5 and proxy settings fails with the error message
"connection refused".
The torrc on the server says
SocksPort 9050
SocksPolicy accept *
but still refuses connections it seems.
Any ideas?

"From the Tor side" do you mean on the server side or something else?

I don't know if that is anything to do with the problem?
I'm not getting any errors, only warnings in the /var/log/tor/log file.
