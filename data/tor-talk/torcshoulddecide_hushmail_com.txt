@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB redesign of purpose? 
Thanks for all these years,
If TBB current "default" policy and strategy - is for obfuscating the
user for the portal to the point it is known that it is Tor user using
- that is not productive after all:
1. Site administrators (like freenode and wikipedia did) block Tor
users (that aren't using bridges, which are disabled by default by the
2. Massive fingerprinting is still here as trackers like ghostery.com
blocks (BTW are there more reliable, FLOSS alternatives?) may track
the full continuous activity even so the IP/cookies are
Am I correct?
If TBB "default" policy could be more than Anonymity Online, more like
an Internet community (project stats estimate 500k of people) decided
to oppose the surveillance, it would be more productive for all of us.
In other words, the change from policy of acting like a "normal" users
to the policy of a proud worldwide community could do the best for the
1. Users which need the anti-surveillance would easily right out of
the box, use the kinds of Ghostery, RefControl, D-N-T, etc., it would
be "new normal"
2. Users which are more concerned about fingerprinting comparison to
"old normals" could disable these add-ons, add more profiles (for
profilers, likely these "tracking Ads companies") of "Tor Users" but
for some people which don't settle the trackers on sites, they would
be more like "old normal".
Is it plausible?
Regarding the "tracking Ads" opposition I have written a few
propositions on the
 comments,
starting with "Thank you for the information, Ultrasurf as a brand is
a scam, I think."
