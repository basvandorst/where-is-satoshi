@_subject: [tor-talk] [Question] Onion router's bandwidth 
I am junior student in Sungkyunkwan University,South Korea
I am studying Tor for my paper
In my research, onion router has to report its bandwidth by sending
descriptor to authority directory.
and then authority directory verifies onion router's bandwidth
[Question 1]
I hope to know the way how authority directory verifies bandwidth which
came from onion router.
I was told that authority directory had bandwidth verifying tool called
bandwidth scanner.
How can I get source code of bandwidth scanner ?
[Question 2]
I made my own onion router, I configured my onion router's bandwidth 100kB/s
But, In updated cached-microdesc-consensus file, My onion router's
bandwidth was estimated at 20kB/s and there is "unmeasured=1"
It means my onion router's bandwidth had not been estimated.
what is difference between measured router and unmeasured router ?
Thank you for reading my question
