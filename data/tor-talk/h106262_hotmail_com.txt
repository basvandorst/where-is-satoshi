@_subject: Meaning of HUP signal and question about directory fetching 
Hello !
About the signals sent by Tor-Control-Port, according to the manual:
 ::RELOAD    -- Reload: reload config items, refetch directory. (like HUP)
I wonder what's the exact meaning of HUP signal, is it exactly the same as RELOAD signal or there is a little difference ? Refetch directory means retrieving an updated directory from the main servers ?
About directory fetching:
I have another question about the Tor client's directory fetching.
When Tor starts, it retrieves a directory from Tor servers right ? Once loaded, when will the Tor client retrieve an updated directory ? On next start or after 2 hours for example ?
Best Regards,

@_subject: Question about Tor/Proxy server and connection type 
I'm currently building a school project about the Tor network, I intend to set up a live demonstration but I have some questions:
I currently use Tor with Privoxy, I noticed that all the connections made to a Web server are "close" instead of "Keep-Alive" for common HTTP/1.1 connections.
I read a thread about it there: It seems that using another proxy (with or without Privoxy ?), Polipo, allows you to connect to a server using Keep-Alive connection type.
So, to sum up, the connection type is defined by the proxy server used with Tor ?
I would like also to show that is possible to do it, is there any tutorial or something similar to set up that ?

@_subject: Is it possible to establish a Keep-Alive connection ? 
Hello !
I would like to know if it's possible to establish a keep-alive HTTP connection-type using Polipo with Tor. I'm currently using Privoxy with Tor, which can only provide close connection-type according to the HTTP Headers.
Thanks !

@_subject: Distribution of bridge information 
I think we should implement a captcha ASAP on bridges.torproject.org. I don't know why it hasn't been done it's a big security hole for the whole network.
I was playing around with an idea of how to distribute bridge information on a mass scale without censor groups being able to automate the process of collecting and filtering the bridges.  I came up with a pretty simple script that contacts bridges.torproject.org, grabs some bridge info, and obfuscates it using the same methods that CAPTCHA systems use to obfuscate images. Now people can read the bridge info, but machines can't(most of the time).
I've put this together as a Wordpress plugin that is available at What this plugin does is grab bridge information, cache it, and obfuscate it for display on your blog.  Since that bridge information won't update for that IP, the plugin only contacts the site about once a day for new information.
My goal here is to allow people everywhere to help distribute bridge information without increasing the chance it will be filtered.  This will hopefully help people in firewalled countries be able to get on the Tor network a little easier.
I'm interested in your thoughts and comments and criticisms.  Is this a good idea?  Do you think people will use it and it will be beneficial?  Is it good but needs improvement?  Also where else could bridge information be grabbed from(rss, twitter, etc)? Thanks for any comments! 		 	   		  Nouveau! D?couvrez le Windows phone Samsung Omnia II disponible chez SFR.

The main point is a machine is faster than human to crawl. Captchas don't stop crawling but reduces the time needed to gather the information. Moreover, using Captcha's may prevent the rise of generated block-lists everywhere, it's always easier (and tireless)  to write a script than add manually top a list 3 IP addresses a day.

@_subject: French 3-Strikes Law 
As I live in France, I think I can give you some insights. There is some points to be enlighted in this law.
The law stated that you are responsible of your connection usage. It simply means, legally, that if someone (undercover or not) else use it, you could be disconnected. They called it the "n?gligence caract?ris?e", meaning you didn't take any countermeasures to prevent someone else from using your connection to breach the intellectual property. The government is currently unable to define this concept and the carelessness's level, technically spoken (your grandpa knows about WPA right ?). Deeply, it is the same problem with the Hotspots (FON for instance), now integrated in our "boxes", a multirole modem (TV, Phone and ADSL). The government stated the bandwidth is too low to share files (not really the case tought). You could say "hey, I won't be fined because a guy connects to internet via its account and the FAI knows it". Well, but your culpability is based on your IP address, that isn't always public (Neuf Wifi for instance). Just pay a FON access and you won't be worried about Hadopi 2.
To me, they didn't think too much (or they don't know about TCP/IP and so on). I won't be surprised if the law proves to be inapplicable.
France's constitutional council has finally accepted the 3-strikes law. Can anyone who's read it comment on what it means for those who operate exits in France? Would operators (likely) be successful in such cases? Would they have some protection from the cases in the first case? Any insights would be appreciated! 		 	   		  Nouveau !

Can you give more information about this provision? Is an ISP responsible for the actions of their users? Is a message board owner liable if someone posts unauthorized material? What about an email service provider? What about foreign sites, or corporate sites? If someone on Blogger posts unauthorized material, would Google's French connections be cut off? Would Larry and Sergey be blacklisted?
As far as I know, the ISP is NOT responsible for the actions of their users. The user supports the whole responsibility, that's why Hadopi2 targets ONLY subscribers and not ISPs. Legally the subscriber is responsible of its internet access, even if it's itself or not. That's why the law states you need to protect your access, so the Hadopi instance will be sure YOU get illegal content and not your neighbor, but they don't define how to protect it.
The law isn't about country-based content filtering. To put it in a nutshell you can still do what you want with your internet access and the connections aren't restricted, but if they prove you share/download copyrighted content (mostly via P2P, they didn't care about streaming), you could be disconnected after 2 warnings.

I agree that if something goes wrong, you need to know who is responsible because the society needs to know. The problem is this system could turn into a kind of "management by terror/pressure", a kind of fake freedom: You can do whatever you can, but we will know in a second if you do something bad.
Though, I don't think anonymity will decide someone to commit a crime or not, it's just easier. It's not because you can you have to do it. The point is if it happens, we (the society) need to find someone to sustain its structure.
This is the darkest point, they just have to say you did something wrong without tell you why and the guiltiness criteria aren't defined. Plus, how does a newbie could be find guilty to use WEP instead of WPA ? 		 	   		  Nouveau! D?couvrez le Windows phone Samsung Omnia II disponible chez SFR.

To tell the truth, I don't believe in this law for the reasons explained before (FON access point, crypto bypass and so on) and I'm not the only one. From an advanced user point of view, how could a minister mixing an office suite and a firewall software fear us (see youtube) ? I think it partially explains the current "soft" protest.

Everyday some people make some steps against anonymity (freedom in fact) while some do the opposite. This law may be a starting point, we have to ring the bell about the risks, but very few people are ready to go back to these methods and reconsidering the human rights. This law exists mainly for economical reasons. 		 	   		  Nouveau Windows 7 : Simplifiez votre PC ! Trouvez le PC qui vous convient.
