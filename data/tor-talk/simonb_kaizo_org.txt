@_subject: Tor Network response slowing to zero 
! I don't know if this is related at all, but I have received personally
! unconfirmed report of the fact that one of Japanese magazine which is
! released on 1/8/2005 covered Tor, and I actually heard that it
! promoted use of a one of domestic file sharing software in that
! article (with some detailed how-to's for accomplishing it), and that's
! like 3 weeks ago.
Do you know what file share program it is or any details ? I guess
it would have been nice had the magazine writers included a "next
set yourself up as a server... section ;-))
