@_subject: exitnodes 
I'm using the lates stable release for Mac Os X
I always restricted my exitnode to the UK, by setting strictexitnodes and having an exitnodes line followed by a list of UK exit nodes names and that works fine.
Recently I tried exitnodes {gb}
and Tor cannot connect.  Shouldn't this work? Am I missing something?
Also, where exactly is the torrc config file I am suppossed to edit on the Mac with the official installtion package?  The one I found and used was blank.

But is?
exitnodes {gb}
supposed to work also? Because it is not for me.
