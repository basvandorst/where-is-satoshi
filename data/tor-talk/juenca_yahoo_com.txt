I see some hidden services name like "name47ghg7i.onion" and I wanna have my own onion address with "name" in front. how can I do this??sorry I looked in list archives and docs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] hidden service on same location as public service 
i'm wonder if it makes any sense to allow users to access a public web server access normal at same time as hidden service on same machine?
The idea not about hiding the location of the server but protect user so server can't know where user comes from (yes, I can also disable logging)
the hidden service docs advise: make sure server isn't view-able on regular internet, but isnt' there still some use?
also wondering if the use of hidden service like this will help fix problem of man-in-middle attacks on SSL like here:
actually, does Tor's encryption fall victim to this?? if not, is HTTPS over hidden service redundant?

also adding plausible deniability that users ever used the website?

ok sounds good.?these r mostly alltrue-istic reasons but my question is more about if it will HELP the user or possibly HURT the user if they have a choice to access the same website on the same server by regular internet or tor hidden service??
sounds like maybe at least it cant hurt
well it's a little bit about USER anonymous (also pausible denialbility), not server.?does this still make sense?

@_subject: [tor-talk] CA cert MITM vulnerability in Tor? (Was: hidden service 
well I think that vulnerability is about using forged CA certs, no need to break the encryption.? there's also the null-byte trick in CA certificates that was discovered to forge CA certs to look legit.
so I wonder if Tor is susceptable to this or if Tor?is a SOLUTION to this problem???
(if not accessing hidden service, traffic at the exit is still vulnerable but if access to hidden service, maybe a complete solution to this problem as long as Tor cant be hacked by this MITM trick?)

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTPS to hidden service unecessary? 
Tor encrypts all traffic, right?? By TLS?? So if running a hidden service, is it redundant to serve it using HTTPS/port 443??

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTPS to hidden service unecessary? 
ok thank you.? yes it's very convenient not have to worry about certificates and .onoin domains so my web site as hidden service can be HTTP but still fully encrypted!? nice

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTPS to hidden service unecessary? 
good point. but don't most regular users install Tor on their PC so it's local, no gateway?
these two things are really esoteric arent they?? i mean, good technology, but not used very often?
good point, although the domain will mis-match so you might still have a problem of user needs to confirm security exception

ok good that was actually my other question, why run exit enclave if you run a hidden service.
i guess you answered my question.? they service different purpose.
are there no security-related concerns of running both ways?
(actually three ways; regular i-net, hidden service &?exit enclave, all on same server for same site content)
only problem is docs make it sound like you have to be more careful setting up for exit enclave
actually docs say this about exit enclave "A great idea but not such a great implementation"

oh that's an interesting idea.? hmmm.
i guess not a security problem as long as the idea is NOT to hide the location of the server
to do that for web service, I'd have to learn how to direct port 80/443 out the exit to a special port locally that the web server can asssign as a virtual host and give permanent redirect to the .onion address
thanks a lot your help.?all the ppl here are so kind

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTPS to hidden service unecessary? 
OK, you're right.? I think in 99% of cases it will be redundant, but you're right I guess.
Problem is now have to understand how easy to serve a special cert for the .onion domain for HTTPS over hidden service (already serve cert on public IP address for the apache virtual domain).? Any howto's out there on HTTPS for .onion?

@_subject: [tor-talk] hidden services 2.0 brainstorming 
But wait.? This isn't even true.? In the thread I started "HTTPS to hidden service unecessary?" only one or two day before this thread, it was shown that there are cases where it is NOT end-to-end if you still don't use SSL.
But no one answered the thread I started "CA cert MITM vulnerability in Tor?" so I am curiously to learn this is not a problem in Tor's encryption....

@_subject: [tor-talk] Transparent re-writing packet destinations to hidden 
I was playing around with "TransPort" in torrc what seem like a very nice feature. Thank you!
My question what if I want to transparently re-route traffic on one port to go to a hidden service but do it transparently? So user thinks talking to example.com but really traffic goes to abcd1234efgh5678.onion.
Is there some linux software or trick that can do this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Transparent re-writing packet destinations to hidden 
Hi sorry to bother, but can anyone make a comments about this? Is should I explain in different words? Key idea is I thinking to make transparent _reverse_ proxy to hidden service.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Transparent re-writing packet destinations to hidden 
thanks for suggestion but its not http. i think http is only protocol with good tools to do this. i know socat could act as reverse proxy into tor SOCKS? interface but its not efficient so i thought better solution maeybe find a way to rewrite packet destinations and use tor TransPort
i guess not? thanks a lot that you replied

@_subject: [tor-talk] Transparent re-writing packet destinations to hidden 
correct me if i'm wrong:: traffic packets have destination IP address in them. i can reroute the IP address but nuthing else because at this layer i don't know a thing else about the packets. so its impossible to re-route to hidden service because .onion address does not resolve with DNS to a IP address right? what DOES hidden service .onion address resolve to? just internal inside tor it flips a switch to use special tor logic? nothing that can be meaningful to put as the rewrite destination in a iptables DNAT command?
is my understand correct?

@_date: 2012-07-19 14:13:00
@_author: Juenca R 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Transparent re-writing packet destinations to hidden 
Maybe? Just think ANY service except HTTP. HTTP has good tools (not just socat) to transparently rewrite destination domain and forward to needed place. Any other service not really has quality tool for that.
If I understand correct, you cant really do it at packet level, you need application level tool that sees unwrapped packets and is designed to allow rewriting and forwarding (to SOCKS or anything else).
That's interesting idea, not quite helping here because with Tor transparent proxy interface (I guess SOCKS too), you still have to get inside the packets and change them from example.com to abcd123.onion so Tor knows what to do with them. Thank you.
