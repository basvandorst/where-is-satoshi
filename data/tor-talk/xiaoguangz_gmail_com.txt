@_subject: [tor-talk] cannot start tor after the 1st time 
Installed tor on Linux Ubuntu 10.04 in Beijing, China. The 1st time everything
ran smoothly and connection to outside world is great! But after awhile there
was no connection any more so I tried to stop and restart tor, and got this
error message:
~/tor-browser_en-US$ ./start-tor-browser &
[1] 1953
~/tor-browser_en-US$ Launching Tor Browser Bundle for Linux in /home/XG/tor-browser_en-US
Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are
and tor failed to connect. I tried to remove the installation completely and
reinstall, but it still doesn't work. Help!

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor not working 
Earlier I posted a question about running tor bundle as a user on a Linux Ubuntu
10.04, running from Beijing, China. Now I have installed tor and vidalia as
root. It still is not working. I have obtained several bridges and input to
vidalia. Below is the log file:
