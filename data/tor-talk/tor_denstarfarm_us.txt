Hello Tor-Talk,
      I am using 31.3.0 (Tor Browser 4.5-alpha-2)
  If  I  use  regular  FireFox,  I  can  type-in  a  local  device, like
  192.254.1.1  . And I get to the device.
  With any versions of Tor, I get a message:
  Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 192.168.x.x
  Am I missing a setting someplace?

Hello usprey,
Thanks for a reply.
Lead me thru this then. I type 192.168.254.16 into the regular old IE8
or Firefox, and I wind up on a local, home, weather-reading device I'd
installed a year ago.
If I however type that into the address bar of my nifty Tor Browser, I
get the aforementioned error message, and not the weather-device. Which,
BTW, hasn't a resolvable address anyway.
That I know of.
Please help me then understand where the Wiki pages tell me how to get
to my device by typing something different.
Again OB, thanks though for answering. I just need a little steering on
this one.

Hello usprey,
many many thanks for the informative reply. NOW I see why I shouldn't
have been willy-nilly allowed to exit to my router, and so forth.
I should find a Tor-List designed for the less-informed User and not tie
this one up. Is there such?

A typo, by me, I'd say.  ..192.168.254.0/24 and so forth.
Thanks again.

Hello l.m,
Pity, that.
I  had  been  enjoying  being  able  to  read, daily, news from a dozen
sources  WW  and  not  worry  somebody  was  profiling  what  I saw as
'germane' .  Albeit to me.
I  did  try changing identities. After numerous "tries", I was successful
onto  FoxNews.  Then shortly that too changed and I was backed to being
I shall give them a try. tnx
I'll report back.
