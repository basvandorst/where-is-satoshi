I'm using Tor Browser 3.6.2-MacOS. I have a site that uses a free class
1 SSL cert from StartCom . Recent versions of
Chrome and Firefox don't seem to have this problem, but Tor Browser
gives the untrusted error. Is there a reason this CA isn't included?

Huzzah! That was the problem (hadn't attached the root and intermediate
CA certs). Thanks for your help.
