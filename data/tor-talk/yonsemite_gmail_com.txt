Greetings! Can VoIP calls, eg., with (2014) majack (magic jack or mj plu$),
obi, ooma?, others or alternative be secure? It'd be wonderful to provide
clear and secure phoning (say, on android, iOS, unix, BB?, windows, chrome
and/or apple's os-s), especially at no cost or below rates of current
providers. It'd support your org possibly too. I've thought of (apps exist)
encrypted voice and decoding on either end too. This earlier concept,
secure communication over net, came as I examined just pay phone apk and
kept force closing upon "enter(ing) lawyer information" (phone number) in
English version with every ani (phone  I could think of. Examples:
+19876543210, 1987654321 or 9876543210 ! Can you write a version also that
uploads crash reports in shorter time periods than overnight? TY

Nathan, thank you, thank you! If you might say which, plumble sounds it, is
easier due to difficulty I've had with sip providers not providing free
instructions during sip configuring. I am an engineer and it follows that
your help could be very appreciated with either method of this selection,
ostel.co or plumble, recalling I don't have sip provider...not yet...
unless you consider vox mobile.Can you please recommend a provider
considering the cost and simplicity of provider if I'll need that (say, one
isn't automatically provided)? I've thought I'd find out your input to save
my reinventing the wheel! Could you also write, second in importance as
possibly, I think, it's only for someone who is in jail, what just pay
phone is about? Ciao!
