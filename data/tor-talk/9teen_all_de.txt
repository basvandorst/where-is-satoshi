@_subject: RelayBandwidthRate Groups ? 
I'm running a tor server close to a peering-point, where I could set the   RelayBandwidthRate parameter for each peer differently, since I have different bandwidth limits amongst the different peers.
I could find an announcement for setting different limits for external and internal networks in the TOR Development Roadmap, but that would be two fixed groups and not enough for our scenario.
Could I have this feature added this to some wishlist ?

worst case: you might get your home searched or computers taken away (for some time).
At least you may need to write letters again and again explaining to some officials, that you run a TOR server and hope they believe you.
But bridge-relays or non-exit nodes are also fine and and help the TOR network as well.

@_subject: TorStatus tells me I shouldn't be there? 
I get this message, when I run a non-exit tor server on my local machine
and access the Torstatus page directly without using tor.
Check your proxy settings ...

So this probably means, that you used the Tor server on this IP, while
the configuration was changed from non-exit to exit-node and the
torstatus page was not yet updated, when you checked.
The "last updated" information is at the bottom of the torstatus page
under "TorStatus Server Details".
Currently the tor node seems to be offline, but here is a profile (last
updated yesterday) which shows, that the node is an exit node:
