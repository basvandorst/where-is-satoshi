I have installed tor rom the sources via ./configure / make / make install. From what i see it went well. I have enabled?
Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
in my torrc. When i start tor i get the error?
Mar 03 10:43:56.377 [warn] Couldn't open file for 'Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log': Permission denied

Ok, the folder doesn' t exist. I` ve created the folder /var/log/tor
drwxr-x---  2 root        staff     4096  2. M?r 11:00 tor
This is a 755. On my system the standard would be a 750.
Anyway, on next startup i got the same error message. So i created a notices.log with a chmod 742 (!). Now i am getting notices.
BUT is this the normal way to install tor from sources? I assumed that tor would create a log folder and a log file. Maybe i simple ./configure wasn' t enough?
I haven ' t tried it, but is a make uninstall possible?

Thanks, but sorry, i can' t get it working. Thought it was a simple automatic process to install tor from sources with the right user and logging etc.
I have
cat /etc/passwd|grep tor
but from the make install i have
drwxr-sr-x  2 root staff 4096  2. Mar 18:48 tor
drwxr-sr-x = 777 (should be 750)
drwxrwxrwx  2 root        staff     4096  3. Mar 13:07 tor
drwxrwxrwx = 777
Maybe i ve set the user tor wrong.
How can i start tor as user tor from torrc, if? I don' t know if that is possible, but from the docs i can' t read that, maybe i overred that.
Actually i am logged in to my ~/ and type tor to start tor.
