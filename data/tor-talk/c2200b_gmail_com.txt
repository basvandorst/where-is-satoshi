@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended method for routing all traffic through Tor 
Hi! I've got tor exit relay running on a dedicated host! About to upgrade
it in a week too! High five to everyone making this project a reality.
I'm wanting all my apps on my desktop to use tor, what is the recommended
method? polipo or privoxy + tor? Do i really need nph-proxy?
Is this if you are just running polipo or privoxy without nph-proxy?:
Thanks, looking forward to routing all my traffic through Tor!
