@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Services Questions (mostly) Please? 
Bare with me as I ramble my way toward hidden services.
First a plain server connect:
Assuming a simple web client using Tor to contact a normal web page, NOT
HTTPS for simplicity.
Client <=> Node A <=> Node B <=> Node C <-> HTTP Server
Node "C" (exit) sees unencrypted traffic to the server and can monitor
Assuming I set up more than 3 nodes in a circuit, can any of the nodes
determine how many nodes I'm using?
Now Hidden service:
Client <=> A <=> B <=> C <=> Rendezvous <=> D <=> E <=> F <~> Hidden Server
I assume that unlike the non-HS, "C" is not equivalent to an exit node and
C <=> Rendezvous is encrypted?
Does "C" know it is the last node before connecting to a Rendezvous?
Is the F <~> Hidden Server connection encrypted or not?
Does "F" know it is the last node and connecting to a Hidden Service?
Thanks for helping to educate me!  8-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service and exit circuit questions? 
I set up a test Stealth Authenticated Hidden Service Web Server.
I noticed examining the logs that the default behavior is for Tor to
establish several "exit circuits". Since the hidden service (HS) does not
need an exit node, I thought to try eliminating all exit circuits.
I added the following to the torrc:
   ExcludeExitNodes 255.0.0.0/1,1.0.0.0/1
Thinking that this excludes the entire Internet as an exit.
Based upon a brief test, it appears to work. I can still contact the HS and
there is no "exit circ" in the log, although it seemed to take longer for the
HS to become known.
This leads me to a couple of questions:
Is excluding all exits a reasonable or good thing to do?
Given that exit circuits are normally pre-established, is it theoretically
possible for an exit node to use its pre-established circuit with my HS to
establish a connect without having the HS encryption cookie, or even without
knowing the "onion" since the circuit already exists?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service and exit circuit questions? 
My primary question is about the established "exit circuits".
If the exit circuits are established, as they are by default, can an exit
node initiate contact with my HS without ever going through a rendezvous or
even knowing the onion address by simply using the pre-established circuit?

Yeah I understand that's the way it's "intended" to work, but:
          ... 1.11. Creating streams
   ...From then on, Bob's OP treats the stream as an
   ordinary exit connection.
   [ Except he doesn't include addr in the connected cell or the end
     cell. -RD]
   Alice MAY send multiple RELAY_COMMAND_BEGIN cells along the circuit, to open
   multiple streams to Bob. ...
Since there is already an established circuit between the machine running the
Tor service and an exit node, I'm thinking that the exit node may be able to
use the existing circuit to access the HS port over the 3-hop circuit without
ever going through the normal 6-hop rendezvous?
Can an exit node initiate a stream back? I understand that the newest nmap
will support scanning through Tor. Will exit nodes be able to scan back?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Getting de-anonymized with SSH (J. S. Evans) 
It can be complicated. Tor itself provides a multi-hop anonymizing TCP connection, however what your application may or
may not do outside of Tor is uncontrolled, this is why the Tor Browser is recommended for use instead of simply proxying
your regular browser through Tor, TBB is designed to minimize undesired side channels.
Your question really is asking about undesired side channels, so the answer is, "It Depends". I'm not trying to be
flippant, it can be complicated. For example if you client application checks server SSH certificates for status (CRL &
OCSP) then you have two immediate concerns: (1) is the OCSP check routing outside of Tor, thus potentially
de-anonymizing you immediately, (2) Even if the cert check runs through Tor, do you ever access it outside of Tor,
creating a potential for correlation. This is why there is still ongoing discussion of whether one should use certs
within Tor.
Another common side channel is DNS. Does the address resolution happen outside Tor (unfortunately a common error), in
which case you're immediately de-anonymized. Even if it takes place within Tor, do you ever use it outside of Tor, again
creating a potential for correlation.
Then there is more esoteric concerns such as the potential for traffic analysis. Does you application create a periodic
pattern of traffic bursts that could be correlated? This would require some pretty heavy effort, but not impossible. Do
you have a Hidden Service that comes up and goes down in sync with a public presence?
Last but not least, there are many executable products that run on your local machine, like JavaScript, that may
de-anonymize, intentionally or otherwise, that are not obvious, such as: PDF documents, MS Office documents, and others.
It's important to set your routing rules to allow ONLY your expected Tor connects and disallow everything else.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor-talk Digest, Vol 88, Issue 13 
This is terribly misrepresented in the press.
There is no problem with the encryption!
The issue is that mail clients are insecurely designed or insecurely configured by users to accept HTML commands to send
out clear text content after decryption. This falls into the more general category of, "Stop being stupid!"
Set your mail client to TEXT ONLY and stop automatically processing someone else's commands on your machine.
If you absolutely can't live without colored fonts and pretty layouts in your email, at least limit the HTML processing
to local content only, in Thunderbird this is called, "Simple HTML."
Full HTML processing (Thunderbird "Original HTML") will reach out to the Internet and do things you may not like,
ranging from confirming you opened the email, exposing your direct IP address, to sending back your now un-encrypted
full content.
Many email clients even support running Javascript or other embedded code. If you enable these features, you may also
wish to roll yourself in butter and seasoned breadcrumbs.
Again, PGP/GPG is just fine, stop doing foolish things.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Disable executable files on a usb from running in, 
Executables on USB block storage devices have not auto-run on Windows for many years and never have on Linux, assuming
you have not changed to an unusual configuration.
There was a time when a U3 Thumbdrive would autorun on Windows by presenting itself as two devices, one of which was a
virtual CD which could invoke the Windows autorun features of a CD. Now, even CDs don't autorun on Windows.
If you are referring to not running even though clicked on and manually OK'd, stop doing that.
The above refers to block storage devices. It's possible to have other usb devices like keyboards that will autotype
when plugged in. Some of these physically look like a thumb drive. Stopping them would be the same as stopping a keyboard.
