@_subject: Vidalia GEOIP file problem... 
Using Vidalia 0.2.6 (PPC) under Mac OS 10.5.8 - when trying to create/ use a bridge, I get this strange error message that reads:
Dec 26 13:53:21.352 [Warning] Failed to open GEOIP file /Applications/ Vidalia.app/share/tor/geoip.  We've been configured to see which  countries can access us as a bridge, and we need GEOIP information to  tell which countries clients are in.
About over half a year ago, the TOR bridge worked fine for about a  month, but then it seemed to fail and not work (sometimes the settings  would tell me that the bridge wasn't running, most of the time no  traffic, etc. - had tons of traffic if I set it to be just a relay).   Until I upgraded Vidalia to 0.2.6 today, I never had a clue as to why  the bridge would fail until I got this message.  What does it mean and  how can I fix it???
Thank you so much!

It should be (?)... 0.2.6 released 02 Nov 2009 - downloaded disk image  name "vidalia-bundle-0.2.1.21-0.2.6-ppc.dmg".  It seems like it points  to a directory and file within the Vidalia package which doesn't exist  (similar to Ticket  on the Vidalia TracReports website???).  The  bridge is pretty much dead.  I tried both solutions offered earlier  unfortunately without success.....
