But this is what your project *is*.   So crack on, and stop being lazy :) If you need to know conceptually what TOR does, read the FAQs. To understand it from a source code perspective, hopefully being a computer science student you know about source code, loading it into an IDE and so on .. so ... steam on!  Others have, and not for a school project either. Now , if you'd said "ive got the TOR source code on punched card format.. where do I start?"  .. that WOULD be a tricky one.. :)
