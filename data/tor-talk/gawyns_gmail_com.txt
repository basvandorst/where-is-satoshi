@_subject: Possible to have "favorites"? 
While it feels like it kinda defeats the purpose with tor, is it possible to have "favorites" to connect through?
Sometimes I need a US ip, sometimes another country. And it feels redundant to click the "new identity" till I get one that is.
I just started using tor, together with foxy proxy, havent used anything else before. windows user.
