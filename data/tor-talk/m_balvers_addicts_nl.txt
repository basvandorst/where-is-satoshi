Hi Tor server operators,
I would like to ask you all a question.
Could you please consider running your server at ports 443 and 80 (if at
all possible) ?
I need to access the Tor network from behind a very restrictive proxy,
and at the moment the performance is regularly worse than in the
'normal' situation. I guess it has something to do with the limited
number of servers running on the mentioned ports.

I was using the setup described here:

I signed up for a mailing-list, and got an automated reply that someone
with my IP number signed himself up far the list. That was correct, i
did sign myself up for the list, the problem is that the request
shouldn't have come from my IP address, but from a Tor exit node.
I stopped squid and only connected through privoxy and signed myself up
again, this time I got the mail with a Tor exit node IP.
Seems to me that the described setup doesn't always use the Tor route. I
verified this by using the old config (with squid) and opening
It said I was using Tor.
After that I stopped Tor and opened the privacy-knoppix page again,
instead of an error, the page just opened, but now it told me I wasn't
using Tor.
Squid probably uses some kind of timeout value to connect to the parent
proxy, if the timeout is reached, it tries to get the page for itself. I
was unable to change this behavior so I stopped using Squid altogether.

@_subject: exit node only server 
My server uses about a 100 kb/s but i guess a big part of the bandwidth is
used for middleman or entry node activities.
Since there are an increasing number of server ops that change their
server from an exit node to a middleman node, the stress on the remaining
exit nodes increases.
Maybe the latency of the network can improve if we have exclusive exit nodes.
I have no idea if this will work. I don't know where or what the current
bottleneck of the network is.
I was just wondering how much traffic my server would generate if it were
only used as an exit node.
There are times that I?m so frustrated with the Tor network that I stop
using it because it is almost impossible to load any page.
I guess that if we have 1000 servers instead of 100 it will all be better,
but that will take a long time... (But then the number of users will have
increased proportionally, so...)

It looks as if you have to set the following config options higher:

    A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth on this node to
the specified number of bytes per second. (Default: 2 MB)
BandwidthBurst N bytes|KB|MB|GB|TB
    Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) to the
given number of bytes. (Default: 5 MB)
If you look at what the routers advertise (I assume masquerade is yours):

You are right, performance usually sucks. You can get lucky sometimes, and
pick a route that actually has low latency, but that doesn't seem to
happen very often.
Keep in mind that latency will always be higher than without tor, you do
have to connect through 3 additional hops to get to your destination. If
every hop happens to be on the other side of the planet, it can add up.

altogether (i know this is bad for anonymity, but i'm ok with that). I

I noticed that i still have very poor performance sometimes, even with
fast (as in bandwidth) nodes. Some nodes taht i found to have high latency
are blutmagie,chaoscomputerclub23 and kyirong (drops most connections).
gpfTOR3,SEC,dotplex1 and Tonga seem to have low latency.
It's not a static thing though, sometimes the 'slow' nodes perform ok and
sometimes the 'fast' nodes perform poor, but overall it seems there are
'good' and 'bad' nodes.
Maybe it's some hardware/network issue of the particular nodes.
