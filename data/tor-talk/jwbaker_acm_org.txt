phpbb is probably the single most dangerous thing you can install on a
computer.  They should rename it "defaced".
Quite a leap to blame tor, although I can see how it might have
attracted attention.  It's much more likely that they found your phpbb
via Google.

Can you use a standard network monitoring tool like MRTG?

@_subject: Why TOR Operators SHOULD always sniff their exit traffic... 
If you seek actual legal advice, you should retain an attorney.
If the larger Tor operator community wants to engage in a high-level
discussion of these matters, perhaps we should try to involve to legal
players, like the cyberlaw center at stanford.

@_subject: Banned from Slashdot 
I'm new around here, and this may be covered territory or flamebait, but I think this is really great.  "Problems" with IP-to-human mapping will eventually become burdensome, and webmasters (far and away the most technologically backwards people using the Internet today) will use the well-designed end-to-end cryptographic features of their chosen medium.
It is ridiculous that you can't use Slashdot over SSL.  In as much as your reputation (on Slashdot, and perhaps in wider geek circles) might be impacted if your account is used for purposes other than your own, you would expect the Slashdot admins to come up with a way to prevent your cookies from being hijacked.  But, of course, they don't.  Instead they rely on sending your identity in the clear, and cooking up mostly-broken mechanisms to regulate behavior based on packet routing information, which is oblique at best.
I think of tor as a kind of gigantic open wifi network.  You wouldn't want to be sending your login information in the clear over some unencrypted 802.11b link, so why would you want to send that information in the clear over another network where it can be observed in transit (by which I mean any and all networks)?  Furthermore, why continue to assume that an IP address maps to a person or behavior, in a world where I can use any one of literally hundreds of 802.11 access points that are in range of my home (and anyone can use mine), and any person can use tor and have their packets popping out all over the planet?  Indeed, the notion of IP banning is triply ridiculous in a system where I can use my ISP's website to provision a new IP address and reliquish my old ones.
I hope I haven't strayed too far from the topic.  My main point is that I hope we all get banned from Slashdot someday, to finally prove the absurdity of banning IP addresses.

@_subject: Memory use 
Is there a way to reduce tor's memory usage?  My node that does nothing
but tor and sshd ran clean out of 32MB memory and 64MB swap after only
1.5 days.  What is the steady-state memory usage like?
Ideally I'd like to be able to deploy tor on devices as small as WRT54G
or Soekris net4501.

@_subject: Memory use 
There are clearly memory leaks of some kind.  In 1.0.8-rc1, tor has
exhausted all memory (192MB) and some swap (37MB) on one of my nodes,
after being up for only 49 hours.
I think I may just reboot my nodes daily.

For what it's worth, 0.9.9 has the same memory behavior.

@_subject: Slashdot banning Tor? 
That's rather the same as Saudi Arabia being worried about too much sand
coming over the border from Yemen.  Slashdot has tons of crap, they need
to blame it on someone, and it may as well be Tor oeprators.
The inability to reach Slashdot is actually a feature.  Maybe Tor could
list it on the website somewhere.

@_subject: Prioritizing from source ip? 
You don't know the source IP if your node is the exit node, that's the
whole point of tor.
