Hi guys, I wonder where can I download that interesting flood software for DDoS that I saw in one of the videos about Anonymous Incident in 2010-2011. And btw how can I react rapidly if the HiveMind is going to attack some new targets? I mean, how to connect to the chat or whatever it is in order to know wtf is going on?
Great thanks,
