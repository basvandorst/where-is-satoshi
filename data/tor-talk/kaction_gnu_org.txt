@_subject: [tor-talk] Another tor exit node operator arrested in Russia 
Bad news, everyone.
Dmitry Klepikov, who was witness in my case[0], and Tor exit operator
was arrested by Russian officials[1,2]. His exit node went offline day
ago [3], and it is the same exit node, that was mentioned in my case[4]
(note fingerprints). "Trial" about his detention is due tomorrow. Sorry, links in russian.

Not everyone have resources to run hidden HTTP server 24/7.
Not everyone want.
So things got more complicated, like some cache service, that serves
last version of Bob page, while he is offline.
This is just my humble impression.

[2018-03-11 09:49] Udo van den Heuvel Wild guess. You are aware, that port < 1024 are so-called privilleged
ports, and require root to open (at least with Linux), do not you?
