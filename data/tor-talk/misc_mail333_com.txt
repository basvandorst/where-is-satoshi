@_subject: Exclude nodes from certain countries 
I'm using Tor on windows I prefer to avoid tor nodes from certain countries. I know that I can manually add nodes into ExcludeNodes setting in Tor Config.
However there are over hundred different Tor nodes in one country I want to exclude. And they're constantly changing (news ones pop up, old ones disappear, etc). It's impossible to do such a task manually using ExcludeNodes setting.
Didn't anybody find a better way?

I understand the part about running squid on localhost and routing web
brouser through it. I can route the traffic from the brouser to squid and
then into tor.
But how can I route Tor client through localhost proxy? Tor client has to
make an encrypted connection to Tor entry node. Do you mean putting squid
in the middle of that encrypted connection? How would you do that?
Plus, that will only filter the entry nodes by country. But I want to avoid
EXIT nodes from certain countries. The entry nodes do not see my traffic,
so I don't really care about them. However the exit nodes can see all my
traffic in clear text, so it's the exit nodes that I want to filter by
country (sorry if I didn't make it clear in my original post).

So your server can see all the traffic in cleartext before it enters Tor
network AND where the traffic is coming from. In other words users do not
have any protection from your server.
If you have not been approached by N$A/C1A/echel0n/etc yet, it will happen
sooner than you think.
Do you realize that fairly soon you will have a choice of various
unpleasant consequences versus obediently logging everything that goes
through your server and submitting the logs to proper channels?
That is, if you don't work there already >:(  Do you, Wesley? This smells
to me like a honeypot...

Scott, anybody who is browsing to  to use Tor there would
OBVIOUSLY use SSL ( SSL support was the first
thing I checked when I went onto their web-site. (If they didn't support
SSL, I probably would not have even bothered replying to that post).
The connection to  would be encrypted with SSL, then the
traffic would be decrypted at  and redirected into their
Tor client, where it would be re-encrypted. Therefore the ONLY party
knowing the author IP and the contents of communication will be
 (unless you use anonymous proxy-chain to connect to
I'm aware of those ISP rooms sucking the traffic from internet backbones
into N$A. So I can only imagine how much pressure this particular
web-server operator will be under, if that's not a honeypot from the start.

I researched it more and everybody is saying squid goes between the browser
and tor:
Browser -> Squid -> Tor
Please explain how can you route Tor through squid?

I know how to filter entry nodes. I can do it with Protowall or another
firewall. That's easy.
I wonder if Tor makes an initial connection to all nodes from which it
later constructs a circuit.
If Tor is never allowed to connect to certain nodes, and therefore "doesn't
know" about them, can they still be used as exit nodes?

But if I click on "network map" in Vidalia I see various Exit Nodes there.
So obviously Tor knows about them.
Also, to determine if a node is an entry or exit node, Tor has to exchange
some sort of traffic with it, right? Since there is no centralized place
where Tor can get a list of all entry nodes, wouldn't it have to poll all
the nodes to determine their status?

That brings back the pain of reading it the first time :)
I must admit I gave up after first few pages. I found it was too technical
and overwhelming, even though I'm not a computer novice.
Now that you pointed me to specific things to research, it's a bit easier
and it's a place to start.
Is there some sort of "in-a-nutshell" documentation without excessive
technicalities that you can recommend?

Thanks Scott,
I understand now that Tor client downloads network-status documents with
descriptors of available onion routers and then chooses the routers for
building circuits from that list. I understand that tor client connects
directly only to entry nodes, and never makes a direct connection with
middle or exit nodes (unless they're later used as entry nodes for
different circuits).
I understand that I can use firewall to control the entry nodes used (the
firewall would prevent connecting to bad IPs, certain countries, etc). But
I still do NOT see how Tor connections to entry nodes can be controlled
with Squid.
It would make sense to use Protowall (with a blocklist from bluetack.co.uk)
to prevent connections to bad IP ranges. That way entry nodes run by
various "bad" organizations will not be used.
But I'm still left with a problem of how to avoid nodes from certain
countries. What especially bothers me is when ALL THREE NODES are chosen
from the same bad country. I would really like to avoid that. I hope solution for Windows will come soon.

How can I put this list into "no-mail mode" (so that I do not receive any
e-mails from it)?
I'm accessing it using the newsreader, so I do not need hundreds of e-mails
simultaneously going to my e-mail account.

Thanks Roger. I guess I was expecting to find an automated way of doing
this. With Mailman one can just send automated commands to the list-server,
in the body of the e-mail. E.g.
"set delivery off"
to put the list into no-mail mode. I've gotten a list of commands that Majordomo at seul.org understands, and
it's surprisingly small. They're still running Majordomo 1.94.5. Apparently
"nomail" is a majordomo 2 command and is not supported with 1.94.5
So you have to add each user who wants no-mail/delivery-off mode to a
white-list manually, er? That sucks! Are those folks at seul.org planning
to upgrade majordomo 2 anytime soon?
Sorry, I've never seen your e-mail. My mailbox was total a mess. I set up
all types of filters and deleted a whole bunch of e-mails on the server
without downloading them. But I was keeping an eye on this thread in

I'm using Tor 0.2.0.22 and it's very slow.
Is there a way to tune TCPIP parameteres in Windows to better work with
Tor? I'm talking most about values in this registry key:
For example, should DefaultTTL be increased, so that packets don't expire
in transit? What TCPWindowSize is better suited for Tor?
My browser connection constantly times out, even though I set timeout to
1200 (as opposed to usual 300). Any suggestions?

Thanks. I'll leave those settings alone. But is there anything else I can

I do not see any difference. In fact, it got slower.
I'm tired of hitting "reload" button in Firefox after constantly getting

Is everybody suffering like that or am I doing something wrong?

NoScript disables javascript.
Total Recall uses Javascript to retrieve most of the information about
firefox addons and other unique settings.
So why wouldn't NoScript be a solution to this leak?

@_subject: GnuPG through Tor 
Is it possible to run GnuPG through Tor? (when connecting to LDAP and HKP
servers to exchange keys)?

@_date: 2008-10-21 11:21:51
@_author: misc 
@_subject: GnuPG through Tor 
You hit it right on the money! If you download the public key without Tor
and then email the person through Tor, it doesn't take a rocket scientist
to put two and two together: that the person who downloaded the key is
probably the one who emailed "anonymously" later. That's a no-brainer, esp
if nobody else downloaded that key for months :)
I have a real problem downloading public keys of Hushmail users. I don't
want to install java, which is required to download their keys through the
browser. They don't propagate their keys to public HKP servers (which I
indeed could assess using Tor & Privoxy). They have their own free LDAP
Is there any way at all to get keys from LDAP server through Tor?

@_date: 2008-10-21 11:45:00
@_author: misc 
@_subject: GnuPG through Tor 
GnuPG only has options for HTTP proxy. But LDAP doesn't work through HTTP
I would imagine for LDAP I would need to direct traffic from GnuPG directly
into Tor (without Privoxy). But how can I do that? How can you run command-line applications (like
GnuPG) under a sockifier like TorCap?

@_date: 2008-10-21 21:28:04
@_author: misc 
@_subject: GnuPG through Tor 
I really don't want to install java. It is a bloatware, it is a security
risk, it's a buggy and useless mountain of code that I won't need for
anything else other than downloading these Hushmail keys. I don't have a
single other application that I'd need java for. No, I'm definitevely not
going to install java.

@_date: 2008-10-22 00:45:53
@_author: misc 
@_subject: GnuPG through Tor 
Absolutely! Do yourselves a favour guys and don't use java on your
anonymous systems. If you have to have java at work, because your company
requires it for something, that's another story. But putting java on your
private system (where you're trying to do everything through Tor and be
anonymous), that's like shooting yourself in the foot.
So any solutions for LDAP key download issue?
