@_subject: Finally: Tor on Android W/O Rooting! 
Hash: SHA1
The latest beta of Firefox 4 on Android (and Maemo) is quite nice. You
can get it here: However, it is lacking the ability to even manually set proxy settings
through any sort of usable interface. Android also lacks the ability to
set system wide proxy settings, which has been a real problem with
getting Orbot (aka "Tor on Android") working for normal users.
I have taken the first step towards porting TorButton to Firefox on
Android, and created a very simple add-on which exposes the proxy
settings. This means you can use Orbot on Android 2.x devices and route
your web traffic through it without needing to root your device! Also,
since I know understand how Firefox mobile add-ons are built, I can now
start engaging with Mike around a full port of TorButton. For now
though, if you are eager to play, you can find "proxymob" here:

This is a bag of curiosities... first, you shouldn't have any issue
acting as a relay with a non-rooted device. The port you are trying to
open is high enough, and there are no iptables or other root related
permissions required for this capability.
The message that stands out for me is:
"Unable to stat resolver configuration in '/etc/resolv.conf': No such
file or directory"
Perhaps the ReachableAddresses setting somehow stops the check for
resolve.conf? I also need to verify whether it is standard or not for
Android to have a resolv.conf in that location.
I will do some testing on my Nexus and a Motorola Droid (Milestone) and
see what I find.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [liberationtech] Not another Haystack right? 
I wrote the block of text attributed to Eugene below, and total agree with you, Andrew. Much of the activist tech support I do is for Tibetans inside Occupied Tibet, and as we know Tor in China right now is quite a difficult proposition. Traditional VPNs can and do work, especially when the user simply needs circumvention, and has enough of a risk safety net that they won't be questioned or detained for simply using a vpn.
As the primary developer of Orbot as well, I also deal with mobile latency issues quite a bit as well, and this has led me to think quite a bit about how the real time browse and click model of the web is highly incompatible with the realities of Tor.
I think the solution for users who want both strong anonymity and circumvention via Tor, and are operating in a high latency environment, is to use applications like offline web cacheing tools (from pay per minute, dial up era), RSS readers, Twitter clients, Podcast apps and even Mail clients, which support synchronization and offline content access. These types of apps minimize the latency a user has to experience, while maximizing the amount of content that can then be shared via sneakernet or LANs.
In summary, I think we should try to expand the way people use Tor, as opposed to pushing them towards less safe solutions.

We ( are looking to widen our test group
for Gibberbot, the Jabber/XMPP client for Android we have developed,
which includes support for true OTR encryption, TLS and Tor integration.
If you have an Android phone and some spare time, please install the
build below, or find it in the Android Market by searching "Gibberbot".
You can talk securely with other users of Gibberbot, or anyone running
Pidgin, Adium, or another OTR-enabled client.
To use Gibberbot with Orbot to route through Tor, you must first start
Orbot, then enable the "Use Tor Network" preference in the Settings
menu. You will need to sign out, and sign back in again.
Finally, by far the coolest feature of this app is the ability to scan
key fingerprints as QRCodes. Fun but very useful, and a great user

Almost there! Thanks to all of you who have contributed your time and

A new build of Gibberbot has been posted:
This is the first release candidate build for our v.0.0.3 release that
we intend to push into the Android Market. We still will build and post
debug/dev builds to Github, but we do plan to being updating the Android
Market on a regular basis for all of our apps.
This build focused on cleaning up the account wizard screens, and
providing a bit better experience for new users coming into the app with
very little knowledge about OTR, XMPP, etc.
We really need as much testing of the OTR/encryption feature as
possible, on many different device and OS combinations. You can download
it from the link above.

Thanks, Chris! We are definitely working to find the right balance in
the security options, but the goal is "security by default" such that it
always tries to OTR, it always uses TLS, and if there it always uses Tor.
Yes, it is. The ORlib library we offer provides some of this capability,
and we should definitely integrate it. There is already a "start Tor"
intent available in Orbot today, as well, that is not very well
documented or utilized.
That is a new idea! Definitely along the lines of what we want to do -
gentle pushes to more fully secure the everyday comms of life. To take a
step back, we should definitely help the user install Orbot if they
don't already have it as well.
Thanks for the feedback, looking forward to more.

Sathya (our fantastic GSoC 2011 dev) has been working on improving the
display of information that we can glean from Tor via the control port
You can see the results of his work (including an initial screenshot) so
far here: We would like feedback from Tor/Vidalia and Orbot users out there on
what data from Tor that you feel is useful and necessary both as a
general case, and perhaps what might be more relevant in a mobile context.
One case to consider is that in mobile, we are constantly losing our IP
connection, switching from 2G to 3G to Wifi to no service at all. What
information does Tor produce that can help the user understand better
the state that Orbot is actually in?
We are also trying to consider three modes of display: the main screen
"dashboard", a full screen detail view, and background notifications
that alert the user to important state changes.

I mentioned this at the Tor Dev meeting, and now we have a build out.
The big news is that you can use this on any Android device without
root. Just install Orbot, connect to Tor, then install this, and you are
ready to browse like an onion.
The main issue we are concerned about tracking down is DNS leaks with
how we are proxying. We have to use HTTP/S proxy support for now, but it
does seem to be resolving names via Tor, since .onion addresses do work.
things we can do to further lockdown webkit, which is the basis for rweb.
You can grab the direct binary and sig from:
Orweb v2 (0.2.1) - now supports Android 2.x and 3.x
Use with Orbot on any Android device without any complex configuration.
It just works right out of the box.. err, market! Also blocks flash and
optionally javascript, and other malicious downloads. Integrates
directly with DuckDuckGo.com's search hidden service for private,
anonymous searching.
updated market page:
Directly binary download:
Source and project:
Orweb is a privacy enhanced web browser that support proxies.
When used with the Orbot (Tor on Android) app, this web browser provides
enhanced privacy features. Through Tor, it prevents somebody watching
your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents
the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets
you access sites which are blocked. It also blocks cookies, keeps no
local history, disables Flash, and requires only Internet permissions,
keeping you safe from malicious content. Finally, beyond Tor, it can
support any HTTP proxy server.
What's in this version:
- added Android 2.x and 3.x support
- new localization / languages
- integrated DuckDuckGo.com search engine
- new icon!

@_subject: [tor-talk] embedding tor into apps? 
I think the model we use for Orbot (always running background service) doesn't port well to the iOS model for multitasking/threading. I think that for the iOS world, creating a TorBrowser app with everything in it makes the most sense. There already numerous examples of third party browsers that have made it through the app store process.
How so? Do the ToS forbid you from creating proxy apps?
tor-dev would probably be better at answering this, but it seems like a somewhat-sane solution to simply fork & call
tor_main(int argc, char *argv[]) from or/main.c, which is basically what
tor is doing (from what I can see) in or/tor_main.c.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot 1.0.5 Release Candidate 
Based on feedback from our core test group in the Guardian Project, it
seems like we have a solid new version of Orbot that includes Tor
0.2.2.25, as well as improved handling of transparent proxying. This new
build also includes our own version of iptables, and proactively checks
if the device has netfilter/owner support in the kernel. This should
lead to overall less support requests from confused users who have
"root" but still can't transproxy.
We have a few UI tweaks to make, and need to make sure all of our
translations are up-to-date, but otherwise, the app feels very ready to go.
I invite any of you with a few spare cycles and an Android device handy
to try it out if you haven't already. As this is a dev build, it is not
signed by the official Tor distro key, so you will have to uninstall any
existing Orbot official release. The final app we release to the market
will be signed by the Tor key, and users will get an automatic "updates
available" message from the Android market.

TextSecure does a great job at secure SMS over GSM-only situations. It

end-to-end encryption as it does text requires a lot more work,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-fi: risks of mobile hotspot feature in Orbot 1.0.6 
Orbot 1.0.6 has a new feature that allows someone with a rooted Android
device that offers wifi or USB tethering, to route the traffic of the
tethered device(s) over Tor.
This means 1-5 devices connected over wifi, or just 1 device (a laptop
most likely) over USB.
While is definitely a feature that has a cool factor to it and will get
some attention, I want to make sure we have thought through the
risks/downsides of utilizing this feature, so that we can communicate
them in any blogs, websites or tutorials. I also wonder if similar
thoughts or documentation has been created within the TorRouter context.
For example, Bob's iPad connects to Alice's Android's Tor-fied Wifi
connection, and uses all sorts of non-https apps that leak enough
information about Bob (google map location data), that reveals Alice's
real-life location.
I keep saying this is no different than TorRouter in terms of risk
profile, but am I wrong?
Here's the important bits of code:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia for Iphone 3g 
I agree that the CovertBrowser approach makes a lot of sense for reaching that maximum amount of iOS users in a usable manner. It was only recently that Apple began allowing alternate browsers and so this approach of embedding Tor in a browser app would not have been possible before then. In addition, the iOS model for background functionality is quite different than on Android, and do not believe it can support long running processes like Tor or Polipo. Hence, this single app, single process model is the only viable one.
The Guardian Project is focused on Android, but we are glad to see Tor brought to mainstream iOS.

You can run the same Tor, cross-compiled for ARM, running on a rooted
Kindle device. The Linux running under the Kindle UI/apps is
surprisingly standard in many ways, more so than Android even. However,
I have only been able to do this over wifi, and have not attempted it
through the 3G connection.
I ultimately don't think the 3G connection would work, as the proxy used
is an HTTP one, and not SOCKS. Until you can tunnel tor inside of HTTP,
then it won't really be possible technically.
In addition, I think Amazon is fairly stringent about bandwidth usage on
this 3G link, and I doubt you would get much use out of it for things
beyond their intended purpose, before you were shutdown.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: [guardian-alpha] CACertMan app to address DigiNotar 
-------- Original Message --------
Organization: The Guardian Project
guardian-alpha at lists.mayfirst.org
As I expect many of you are aware, there was a major compromise to a
Dutch Certificate Authority named "DigiNotar" recently, where they
allowed SSL certs for domains like *.google.com, *.torproject.org and
even *.cia.gov as well as *.*.com to be issued.
It was brought up to the contribs of CyanogenMOD that they should
probably remove the DigiNotar CA cert from the built-in Android OS
keystore (located at /system/etc/security/cacerts.bks). Since they have
500k+ users, and can be more nimble than other ROM/device distributors,
it was seen as a way to quickly address the problem, at least within
their community. It turns out that it wasn't as easy to convince them to
do this (even though Mozilla, Google Chrome, IE, etc already had). You
can read the thread, but it is still an open issue:
In the meantime, I decided to do something proactive about this, and
took two approaches:
1) Create our own curated cacerts.bks file which rooted users could
install using 'adb' from their desktop and/or the 'Root Explorer' app
available in the market and elsewhere. Our version of the CACert file
removes DigiNotar, as well as CNNIC, a Chinese gov't-managed cert
authority who we have reason not to trust. Our goal is to continue to
audit, update and distribute our own cacerts file for users who trust us.
Install info:
Guardian's CACert:
2) We also wanted to create an app that let the user decided which certs
they wanted available, and which they didn't. Beyond this one CA
problem, there are potentially many more, and every handset manufacturer
or carrier can also place their own CA certs into the system. We need an
app to address today's and future CA threats.
I have been hacking away on a solution to address this, and an initial
test release is available for you. 'CACertMan' is a simple app that
loads up the system cacert store, allows you to back it up, search for
certs, delete them, and then save it back to the system. You can always
restore from your initial backup, as well. In the future we may allow
for a cert to just be disabled, but for now it is delete and/or restore.
Here is the first alpha build for testing. This does require root, as
well as a device that has the 'grep' command on it. This is basically
CyanogenMOD, but most likely any other custom ROM. If the 'save' doesn't
work, then you will need to use 'RootExplorer' to make you /system
parition read-write.
You can find the source project here:
Once we get confirmation that the app works for most people, we'll place
it in the market, and on or site for wider distribution.
Through these two approaches, we hope to mitigate the threats facing
Android users who might encounter man-in-the-middle attacks enabled
through the DigiNotar exploit. While many of you are presumably in
"free" countries, we do know that may of our users of Orbot, Gibberbot
and other software are not, and we hope this message can reach them.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Basic Orbot question 
This is a tricky issue in that what you are seeing is just the Orbot background service loaded in memory, but without it actually doing any thing at all. Android will always start the service on boot, but by deselecting the check box for auto start, the Orbot service knows not to start the connection to the Tor network. It is taking up minimal memory, and not able to access any other data or services, so in fact, it is nearly the same as not running. However, I do understand why you may expect it to not run at all.
We can take a look to see if it is possible for us to entirely stop the background service after the boot sequence. If possible, it would be in the next minor update in a few weeks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Sonic Firewall, Iran related? 
I have been in touch with an Orbot user at a university somewhere in a
relatively free country in Asia, who just a week or so ago found that it
no longer worked for him. He was unable to connect to the Tor network
either directly or with bridges, and it seemed like SSL related errors
were occuring.
He wrote me today saying this:
"Today I had a talk with the head of computer department, he said that
the sonic wall blocking policies are automatically updated and they
can't do anything with that."
While I do not know who "automatically updated" their firewall rules, it
is interesting that this wasn't a targeted Tor thing by the local admin,
but some wider deployment, perhaps directly from Sonic corporate themselves.
On a hunch, I sent him the new Orbot+OBFS bundle to test out, and it
worked like a charm. He was very excited, and has promised to be a loyal
tester. It indeed seems like they were doing a similar SSL/TLS DPI
block/filter as what is happening in Iran.
Now the timing of all of this, and the similar approach to filtering
made me curious if this could perhaps be related... could some ISP or
national NOC in Iran be running the same product as this university in Asia?
Regardless, it seems like the SSL/TLS DPI might become a standard
tactic, and the needs for obfsproxy will be growing rapidly.

This one is really going to be FINAL. I just know it.
Primary features to test:
- moving Orbot to external storage/SD card and ensure it still runs
- does the wizard properly detect that you have root (or not)?
- using transproxying all vs transproxying app-by-app
- "Tor-fi" usb and wifi tethering over Tor
- exit/entrance node values with Strict Mode (to ensure geoip file is
unpacked "on-demand" the first time you use this feature)
- reduced data folder size by making geoip file only installed on demand
- added options for turning off persistent notification
- enabled access to localhost ports for SOCKS, HTTP, etc even when
transproxy is on
- improved handling of tor and privoxy binary upgrades
- updated openssl to 1.0.0f to address recent SSLv3 threat
- check for root mode uses "which su" command and does not look for
- changed tor binary res/raw storage mechanism to use the "mp3" file

So to get back to the start of this, it seems like this ANONdroid app is
gaining traction, and I am wondering if the Guardian Project should
endorse it or not. We don't have much interest or time in getting
involved in its development, but on occasion people come to us asking
for a solution to work in places where Tor is not working so well at the
moment, and perhaps JonDoNym is.
I suppose the answer is "read this thread and decide for yourself" or
"create a threat model for mobile users in X country and compare Orbot
and ANONDroid", but if someone can just tell me the right answer, I can
go back to lying on the beach all day drinking beer.

Great post+effort by our new intern "Patch", and generally good outcome

"I decided to take on the challenge of auditing Twitter+Orbot to gain
more insight (and hopefully trust) into their new support for proxying.
I logged some traffic on my Nexus One using the proxied Twitter
application to see what was going on. To eliminate excess traffic I used
Droidwall to permit only traffic from Orbot and Twitter. This still
allows the Twitter application the option to leak data while blocking
other traffic we don?t wish to see.  I began logging with Orbot off and
attempted to update my Twitter application. So far so good, it was not
able to retrieve any tweets. Once Orbot was running the application
worked great, I ran some searches and made a test tweet. "

Interesting.. was considering this exact feature for Orweb. At the very

background thread, so that the primary content on the page loads faster.
Another take on this whole "no ad" / faster experience, is something
like Readability ( which renders a web page
as a well-formatted, print/type centric experience. Obviously people use
Tor for more than reading lengthy articles, but this does establish a
user-focused standard to content access, as opposed to a publisher
driven preference.

-------- Original Message --------
Organization: The Guardian Project
As a test, I just made this "NPToR News" based on the NPR open source
news/podcasting app... NPR = the U.S.-based National Public Radio
service. They offer their app and API as open-source/open-protocol code
I am happy to report that listening to the radio over Tor is a pretty
decent experience, even over 3G.
I've modified the app to:
1) use HTTPS connections with the OnionKit's StrongHTTPClient and
StrongTrustManager. You will see a "Secure Connection Active" notify in
the notification bar, for example, when it connects.
2) use HTTP Proxying to Orbot's Privoxy/Tor localhost 8118 proxy
3) use the OrbotHelper to check if Orbot is installed/running and prompt
the user appropriately to resolve any issues
4) removed all Google tracking, advert display in the app

I understand. If you have a rooted device, you can run Orbot with

Otherwise, the apps that support Orbot/Tor on an unrooted, stock device

and Firefox with the Proxy Mobile add-on.

Hash: SHA1
After previous fits and starts, we've stabilized Orbot v11 now with
the RC6 release. Our core testers and public users via the Google Play
distribution are back to happy and stable states of being.
The latest version can be found:
1) In Google Play:
2) In our F-Droid repo:
3) Our via direct APK here:
As always you can file bugs on trac.torproject.org or the guardian
tracker: A few things I learned during this latest Orbot effort:
- - 0.2.4.*-alpha is not stable yet on Android, causing a variety of
to-be-debugged issues. Based on that, we rolled back to 0.2.3.23-RC
for this release. We may still do a final/stable v11 release once Tor
0.2.3.* is declared stable.
- - Android has a "Strict Mode" feature that can sometimes cause halts,
exits at various points based on certain types of undesirable
behaviour, like accessing the network on a main thread. The new
up/down data stats inadvertently accessed the localhost Tor control
port on the main thread. Most devices just have it set to log a
warning to the debug output, but on a few devices it made things go boom.
- - We needed to rewrite our iptables rules quite a bit to use a
separate user defined chain "ORBOT" with a jump point in OUTPUT chain.
This allows us to easily flush all ORBOT rules. We realized this was
necessary because as some devices switch between 3G and wifi
connections, iptables rules are reapplied automatically causing
multiple instances of the same rule. Only a flush can clear all of
instances of these out easily. Second, we can't do a global iptables

While we don't need a very complex p2p design (in short, we are mostly
just talking about simple HTTP servers running on each device, behind
a hidden service .onion), I am concerned in the long run about
scalability and reliability of this. It is not unheard of for apps
that work well and do something cool to suddently have 1M+ users, and

I can tell you that based on prototype code I have created, SMS and

latency is not bad, especially since the apps are coded to be

someone to respond does not bother users.
Hidden Services as a globally anonymous NAT'd networked is an amazing
opportunity for this type of application. We just need to solve the

Regarding the Tor security advisory
I've been considering whether this exploit or a similar one could be

Orweb has Javascript and Cookie support off by default for all sites, so
I expect a Javascript exploit would not work at all. However, if we
enable both (which many users do in order to login to sites with
captchas), could that open Orweb users up to this deanonymization attack?
I hope to replicate this in a test environment shortly, but if anyone
has insight related to Webkit vs Firefox/Gecko in terms of this exploit,
please share.
In addition, if anyone is motivated to do their own independent auditing
of Orweb along these lines, would love to have your help.

Thanks for the update from a happy birdy user! It has been very useful on my recent global travels, since many of the "free" networks I come across actually block non-web ports. Also as the person who does all of the GP email support, I am happy to not broadcast my actual IP in mail headers.
At one point in India, the network latency was bad enough that I had to disable TorBirdy because it made managing email unusable. I tried to sync at night and do everything offline, but couldn't quite get it to work. Perhaps it was more of a Thunderbird issue, but the sync/offline model of use seems the most appropriate as opposed to expecting realtime speeds.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Another Hidden Service question 
Does the fact that my actual IP address has changed (say my Tor client
moves from a 3G to a wifi connection), or by extension, by Tor client
has stopped and started, have any impact on the availability of a Hidden
Service I am hosting?
What I am seeing is that I can initially connect to a HS hosted on my
Android phone from a remote computer when the phone is on wifi. However,
when I switch to 3G, I am unable to connect from the same remote
computer anymore, and the same issue when I return to wifi.
I understand that HS were designed for "servers", but this research I am
doing is using them more in a client mode, similar to TorChat, though in
a manner I hope doesn't trash the Tor network or otherwise cause
scalability issues.
I am currently testing this on 0.2.4-10-alpha.

That is the rub, obviously. A FirefoxOS phone is built around the concept of JavaScript as the primary application programming language. If JavaScript is off, then the phone might as well be bricked.
What I was suggesting was to explore the possibilities of a JS version of Tor within the limited bounds of what would be possible with that context, I.e. not strong anonymity or defense against remote JS exploits.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using Mumble with Tor 
If you are on the otr-dev list, you might have seen some discussion on
improvised support for a data channel in OTR v3, to use with the ability
to generate an "extra" symmetric key:
"OTR version 3 defines an additional symmetric key that can be derived
by the communicating parties to use for application-specific purposes,
such as file transfer, voice encryption, etc. When one party wishes to
use the extra symmetric key, he or she creates a type 8 TLV attached to
a Data Message (see above). The key itself is then derived using the
same "secbytes" used to compute the encryption and MAC keys used to
protect the Data Message. The extra symmetric key is derived by
calculating h2(0xFF) and keeping the entire 256 bits, using the same
definition of h2 as above."
We are actively developing this as part of our OTR implementation in
Gibberbot for Android, v12, and have most of it working
Our plan is to use this to implement media sharing, and even a
push-to-talk feature, that is all securely tunneled through OTR.
So, in short, there will soon be such a thing as OTR for voice, video
and files. :)

The issue with using the voice/SMS encryption on the cell network is
that unless you can get an unregistered SIM card, then all of the
traffic analysis "metadata" is easily tracked, stored and analyzed.
This is why I have been motivated to focus on IP-based voice and
messaging solutions, particularly those that can work over TCP and Tor.
Our app Gibberbot currently supports XMPP over Tor, and we are currently
adding push-to-talk voice messaging as part of that chat session in the
Fall sometime.
I understand your motivation towards wanting a non-IP encrypted voice
and SMS solution, but it has its own problems, and honestly, from my own
personal hands-on experience using them, they are very, very hard to
make work properly. Specifically, you need the CDPD network service (aka
the GSM "Fax" channel) to be available for use, and that just does not
happen very much any more.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot and Orweb (take two) 
The main reason we keep them separate is that Orweb can be used with any HTTP proxy server, not just the one provided by Orbot.
In addition, many apps can use Orbot, beyond just a browser, and it runs all of the time in the background.
OnionBrowser is forced to bundle due to iOS restrictions with background user processes.
In the end, is it really that big of deal or a user impediment to have two apps?

@_date: 2013-05-27 17:45:35
@_author: Nathan Freitas 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot and Orweb (take two) 
Yes, we have considered it. Definitely for the new user, having a simple, single app experience does make sense.
 From a security perspective however, if a website can somehow compromise the Orweb browser webkit component, they would have greater access to the integrated security of the app, then if Orbot was a separate app and process. Still, these are things that Tor Browser on the desktop already deals with successfully.
We are working on it, but it does not easily map directly into Tor's transproxy or socks proxy ports. The VPN api really expects an app to connect to a single known remote IP/port, while Tor connects to many different IPs and ports. This makes marking the more dynamic Tor traffic as "dot not send through VPN" a bit tricky.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Financial Transparency 
Hey Juan. I feel like I have something to add to this discussion, even though generally, as others have said, this is not a new discussion.
This is the same as saying that any safe or vault can be opened by someone with a powerful enough laser or explosive, yet we still use safes and vaults to safeguard precious possessions and sensitive documents, don't we?
This is a basic security metaphor that must be understood. There are no absolutes. It is about how hard you make your adversary work. This is the real world of humans trying to get some digital advantage against very real, well funded adversaries.
For combating mass dragnet activities, Tor is fantastic. For circumvention, Tor is fantastic. For always defending 100% against the alpha dog surveillance organization on the entire planet? Maybe Tor has some trouble there, but I don't consider it a flaw, unless you can show me 100% total correlation of all in and outbound traffic, such that it is *worse* to use Tor than not to.
With my work on Tor for Android, there are obviously a million horrible eventualities that could come about by expecting privacy on a smartphone with a SIM card. Yet, many people use Orbot, and are very happy with the protection and freedom provides, even though they understand Google may know something about them, or that the telcomms do know many things. Tor gives them a small window of freedom, and if configured properly on a secure phone, a great deal of freedom.
Tor is used by a wide variety of people, and it is designed with many user stories in mind.
Yes one user story is "I want to remain anonymous from the US government" for sure.
Another one though is "I want to access a website blocked in my country" and "I want to make sure the admin of the network I am on cannot intercept or track my email traffic, so they won't be alerted that I work for X human Rights group".
When you get out into the real world, the antiseptic stance you are taking doesn't matter quite so much. Saying Tor is flawed because it doesn't withstand the worse case scenario crypto-armageddon is just not an interesting a discussion to have for the fourth or fifth time.
Finally, one of the most promising uses of Tor are around whistleblowing services like Globaleaks, which require a Tor hidden service to access. In that case, the global adversary problem does not exist, as the Tor exit and the web service are on the same box.

Overreach maybe, but I do not think I veered into the "quite dangerous"
territory. Still, when you start trying to reason through discussion
like these, you can easily go down that road.
Right, but you can hypothetical talk about nanobot atom-disassemblers,
who can safely chew through the safe, and how the safe was not designed
for that potential eventuality, and so it is flawed.
I personally assume, that someone could always open the safe, and access
the contents within. What I consider is, are the requisite resources to
do so equal with my value as a target? Will the adversary even know I
have the safe in the first place? I don't think most normal humans on
the planet have access to thermic lance proof safes.
Agreed. I am not saying be complacent. I am just trying to counter the
perspective that because Tor cannot do something, that it is
fundamentally flawed, broken, or without value.
Okay, but that is different than the entrance/exit correlation that most
people speak about when they are discussing global adversaries.
Anyhow, I've made my one comment per month, for better or for worse.
Considering the private email response I have received from Juan, it
probably was not a useful effort on my part to engage.

@_date: 2013-09-12 09:33:44
@_author: Nathan Freitas 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Financial Transparency 
My response was not a general truism. It was an important lesson for
users of any system, that there is always a weakness, always an exploit,
even if Tor were engineered itself to protect from all adversaries.
I remember when the FBI arrested one member of Lulzsec by sitting
outside a potential suspects house, sniffing his wifi (potentially by
cracking it?), and seeing that there was a lot of traffic to Tor
entrance nodes. If he had only uses ethernet or a VPN to wrap his Tor
connection, it would not have happened. This is not a flaw in Tor (that
Tor does not do a better job in obfuscating entrance nodes), this is
just the reality of atoms and flesh.
When I work with Chinese and Tibetan activists, and they can actually
get an obfs3 bridge connection working inside of China, they are happy
to have it, but know it is only a matter of time before the IP is
scanned and blocked. I am eager for all of the various pluggable
transport R&D to help expand this time window to days, weeks and months,
but I am under no impressions that any implementation will solve the
problem forever. It will just force the Chinese surveillance system to
spend more processing power, more money, more energy. That is NOT a flaw
in Tor.
I think you have something useful to contribute, and seem like a
thoughtful person. I am just became interested in trying to push the
conversation to somewhere different than the usual territory. If you are
not interested in that, then EOM.
If we are still at the point where you are calling Tor a "US military
project" then I am not sure I can make any case that would satisfy you.
Google is a US Military Project (see USG/DARPA funding of Standard
Digital Library research in the 1990s), yet you are using Gmail, you
find value in it. If you have a mobile phone, that is largely the result
of a US Military Project (World War II), and is clearly a tool for mass
surveillance and logging. Perhaps you do not use one? Maybe.
Ultimately, I come at this as an activists looking for tactics and tools
to help me win. I am not a cryptologist, I am not a mathematician. I
believe myself clever enough, and the people I support, to use these
tools in a way that provide maximum benefit, and outweigh their risks.
Tor does a better job than any other technology product that exists to
maintain my faith that the technology does what is says on the box. That
is the best case I can make for it.

It comes down to what are you afraid of?
If it is dragnet surveillance, logging, censorship and other
networked-based threats, then using Orbot, ChatSecure, TextSecure,
SilentCircle, RedPhone, etc, makes a lot of sense. If you are living
in Turkey, and you are trying to get to Twitter, using Orbot on your
phone and setting the Twitter app's proxy to localhost:8118, solves
your problem. If you don't want your SMS message history logged by
your telco (or a state-sponsored surveillance system), then using
TextSecure or ChatSecure solves the problem as well.
However, if there is any chance that you are under threat for a
targeted attack, then the requirements for "secure" are many orders of
magnitude higher. In this case, as others have said on the thread,
using a non-baseband mobile device (like a Nexus tablet) with as open
firmware as possible (replicant, omnirom), and without Google
Apps/Accounts, gets your pretty far.

Remember how Tor doubled its user base in Turkey in the last month?
Well, at least ~18,000 of the 30,000 were Orbot users:
which I believe was driven directly from the fact that Twitter for
Android includes very easy proxy settings, and that Google Play itself
was not blocked. There were a number of articles, tweets, in Turkish,
that laid out the easy process to install Orbot, enabled Twitter proxy
settings, etc.
It would be nice it had been 30,000,000 new users (considering the
population of Turkey is 74 million), but it might be good to think about
Turkey's Twitter block as a "censorship-lite" event, not unlike the UK
or Indonesia, and then figure out how we can encourage more adoption
next time.

No they are not, but for most of these user's, their goal was to be able
to access Twitter, simple as that. Not every censorship-state is a
totalitarian police state and not everyone's threat model includes
baseband/backdoor attacks and torture.
In addition, within the context of what Tor offers, there is no feature
related to physical security of the device it is running on. Tor leaves
passwords, cookies, keys, caches, etc all written without encryption to
the machine it is running on. In most desktop systems, any app you run
as a user, has access to this data.

Yes, that is exactly the issue with stock VoIP clients. It is quite
difficult (impossible?) to get Jitsi, CSip or Linphone to send the RTP
stream over TCP. Perhaps it is also our server (Kamalaio) or media proxy
configuration... something to dig into.
Skype on other hand seems (or seemed to) magically just try all possible
means of busting through the firewall/iptables rules like oil spilling
out of sinking tanker, and so the TCP only route over Tor was fine for it.
BTW, it also seems Google Hangouts+ uses TCP, or can use TCP when routed
over Tor.

Hello from the Tor dev meeting. I'm working on trying to help come up
with some better narrative around the types of features, functions and
actions a user of Tor-based software might want. The goal is to get
beyond "anonymity" or "better privacy" as an answer to what Tor does.
This will also help shape feature decisions in apps like Tor Browser and
Orbot, as well as influence long range roadmap type thinking and discussion.
If you have a Tor trac account, please contribute the log of user
stories here:
or just reply to this email with some of your own, that I can add.
A few examples....
A blogger in Uganda wants to document and publish local personal stories
related to the fight against anti-homosexuality legislation, but is
worried about being persecuted, or having the subjects of their posts
A journalists wants to communicate with a source using a chat/instant
messaging on a web or mobile device without exposing that they are
talking to the source, or having anyone log that they were talking.
A student at a high school is searching for information on this history
of abortion law for a paper, but the schools internet filters block all

TOR First Trojan for Android

Topics: Threats to mobile devices , Google Android
Virus writers are creating Android-Trojans, traditionally used as a
sample functional Windows malware. Now, another "trick? Windows Trojan
malware is implemented under Android: we found the first Android-Trojan,
who as a C & C uses the domain of pseudo-zone. Onion. Thus, the Trojan
uses the anonymous network Tor, built on a network of proxy servers. In
addition to providing user anonymity, Tor allows you to post in the
blast zone. Onion ?anonymous? sites accessible only to Tor.
Backdoor.AndroidOS.Torec.a is a variation of the popular Tor-client
Orbot. Attackers have added your code in this application, the Trojan
does not impersonating Orbot, it simply uses the functionality of the
Trojan can get to the C & C the following commands:
start / stop intercepting incoming SMS
start / stop the theft of incoming SMS
make USSD request
send to C & C data on the phone (the phone number, country, IMEI, model,
version of OS)
send to C & C list of installed applications on your mobile device
send SMS to the number specified in the command
Using TOR has to intruders its pros and cons. Among the advantages that
such a C & C can not be closed. The disadvantages include the need for
it is worth the additional code. To Backdoor.AndroidOS.Torec.a could use
Tor, it took much more code than for its own functionality.

Well that might be - you can use 3G on your phone still through Tor,

also sent through Tor.
In theory, but it starts to get pretty complicated with all the

Orbot v13 release candidate 1 is available for direct download:
APK: sig: and later today, our F-Droid repo and Google Play.
As mentioned before, this release is built on Tor 0.2.4.20, OpenSSL
1.0.1e, and XTables v1.4.21... all the latest bling across the board.
In addition, some important fixes to the Orbot service, to ensure it
remains running in the background, and the active notification keeps
working, as well. Finally, we've changed the way the native binaries
are installed, making it more reliable and clean across devices.
This has been tested on devices ranging from an old Samsung Galaxy S
running 2.3.6 to a Galaxy Note 3 on Android 4.3 with KNOX, as well as
CM10 and some other OS variants.
We will do not have X86 or MIPS binaries built-in, but are considering
adding them, as there seem to be a huge amount of Android X86 devices
coming out of CES this year!

I would be more than happy to direct Orbot users who want this functionality to your app, once its stabilizes, and as long as we can assure a fairly streamlined user experience.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor implementation in JavaScript / FirefoxOS 
Since FirefoxOS = Android with Gecko/HTML5 skin
we know that the Tor binary port that is part of the Orbot build process
should all but work on FirefoxOS. I have been hoping to have time to
attempt either a manual install of the binary, and a custom build of the
OS to verify this, but have not had time, or found some with the right
manually or via transproxy) would be applied to the system. From my
initial review of FirefoxOS from a user perspective, it is apparent they
have not built in even basic HTTP/SOCKS proxy settings capabilities at
the system-wide level.
Now, each Gecko/HTML5 app may be able to specify these options using the
same types of config settings available within Firefox add-on
This would be a good thing to research and confirm.
Based on his work in Tor Browser, Mike Perry has conceived of a whole
heap of problems related to privacy and anonymity based on whether apps
are treated like tabs in a single browser, or whether each app is its
own browser instance (or at least that is my poor man's interpretation).
I hope we has time to write these up publicly to get feedback from Mozilla.
I think the Tor in Javascript idea is fascinating, once we all start
trusting Javascript from crypto. I feel like we all don't trust some
language (C, C++, Java, etc) so perhaps that hurdle is not as big as it
might seme, especially if we can get Tor support on a $25 FirefoxOS phone.
That is all I have for now!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor implementation in JavaScript / FirefoxOS 
Great, thanks! I think there is a feeling that it is somehow an
"enterprise" feature, and so is often left out.
Otherwise, will dig more into porting Tor to "Gonk":
and perhaps providing Tor native as an optional update package:
The real question is, can Tor run in the background as a general service
to multiple apps (as on Android), or will it have to built into each app
(like on iOS).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor implementation in JavaScript / FirefoxOS 
Impressive work!
If today, I wanted to build an HTML5/JS/REST app, say something like
Globaleaks or Crypto.cat, that had note-Tor built into it, that should
work fairly easily then? Both of these apps make single JSON-type HTTP
connections to a single server, so the need for general purpose
web-browsing is not necessary.
Yes, agreed, and on mobile devices the option for proxying seems to be
never there by default, at least as part of the browser app.
The issue will be (and I am sure there are many more) that when your
Gecko/WebView container loads up the page you request, all subsequent
requests for content for embedded images, js, etc will also need to be
routed over this new API, and all standard HTTP connections blocked.
It is pretty exciting to see that Tor now has viable implementations in
C, Java and Javascript.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot v14 alpha: obfsclient, Tor 0.2.5.3-alpha 
Yes, it seems that when Polipo was removed from TBB (since it was no longer needed for Firefox proxying), that around the same time (2011?) there were some serious security bugs discovered, and development on Polipo was dormant. This led to Tor switching back to recommending Privoxy as the HTTP proxy for those that need one.
However, Polipo is being actively maintained again, and the known issues addressed. I wanted to explore its use with Orbot because it does seem to use less memory than Privoxy, and is a bit faster as well. It is also cleaner to integrate due to the project being available as a git repo.
If there is conclusive evidence or a community decision that Polipo must not be used, I am willing to follow that, but for now, we are experimenting in alpha-ville.

Yes... Bridges are applied via the control port, and Tor will still bootstrap if the config settings fail. Maybe we should not do that on further thought.

I just want to say how gratifying it is to have another person in the

see Orwall get to 1.0.
My main critique right now is that the UI is quite complicated, and has
way too much text. I know your starting point was to automate the
instructions from Mike's blog post, and you have achieved that. However,
if we want to reach my goal (remove all root/transproxy features from
Orbot), we need to still support the one or two-tap capability that
Orbot now provides.
Perhaps you could add a default "easy mode" which starts with this, and
then hide the current UI under an advanced mode?
These are all great, and go way beyond anything we have in Orbot!
all the best!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: [guardian-dev] Progress on OrbotVPN 
The work below would remove the root/transproxy feature from Orbot, and
replace it with using a Android VPN/tuntap interface capability routed
through Tor's SOCKS via tun2socks. This means anyone can enable the
"send all apps through Tor" feature even without needing root. When the
VPN mode is on, we will also by default only allow secure ports (443,
etc) through in the torrc configuration, as well. For users wanting to have root/transproxy capabilities (including app by
app proxying options), they will be able to still use Orwall.
Feedback is welcome, especially from anyone with experience using Tor
and tun2socks.
----- Original message -----
I have successfully gotten the Psiphon version of tun2socks working with
Orbot. You can see the code here:
The trick with Android VPNService is that you have to mark sockets
"protected" in order to not have them be sent through the VPN. Tor opens
a ton of sockets all the time to many remote servers, so it is hard to
track those at the Android/Java level, since those are happening in the
Tor native process. Instead, I set Tor to use a mini outbound SOCKS
proxy I am running in the TorService class, and then I mark all the
sockets outbound from that proxy I mark protected. Seems to work without
much performance issue.
Aside from UI integration, the main outstanding issue is getting DNS to
work. When you create an Android VPNServer instance, you can only set
the DNS host "127.0.0.1" but not the port. Since Tor's DNS service is
running on 127.0.0.1:5400 I somehow need to get DNS packets to go there,
and drop the rest of the UDP.
My idea is to use the udpgw_client feature of tun2socks, and then run
the udpgw daemon on the device. I have already modified the tun2socks
code to change all DNS packets to use 5400 port, before they get sent
through udpgw. I did also have the idea for a bit of setting up a ton of remote udpgw
servers that Orbot users could randomly connect through, because that
would allow for UDP to work over Tor... I really don't like
running/managing servers however, but maybe Tor exit providers could
start running udpgw instances?

Anonymity on the Go: The Possibilities and Problems of Tor on Mobile
This talk discusses what possibilities exist for communicating more
freely on a mobile device. How can we stop telcos, ISPs, and our
governments from tracking the apps we use, the sites we visit, and the
people we communicate with, all tagged with our location data? How can
we ensure that we have open and unthrottled access to the services we
need, no matter where we are? While not a panacea, Tor is one project
working to address these questions, and for five years, has been
supporting mobile devices, as well.
Speaker: Nathan Freitas is the lead developer of Orbot, Tor for Android,
and the Orweb and Orfox privacy enhanced mobile web browsers. He also
founded the Guardian Project, a five year old effort that creates
easy-to-use open source apps, mobile OS security enhancements, and

@_subject: [tor-talk] using UDPGW and tun2socks over Tor 
Is there any reason we shouldn't consider supporting UDP over Tor with
Orbot, by tunneling the packets using the combination of badvpn's
tun2socks and udpgw ("udp gateway") feature? This has come up as we are
implementing the Android VPNService, and discovered how easy to
implement and well performing the badvpn UDP tunneling capability is.
It does mean that someone would have to operate the
gateway/infrastructure portion of udpgw at a capacity necessary to
handle all udp streaming traffic sent for all Orbot users, but I would
consider that to be feasible. Perhaps udpgw instances can be run along
side all Tor exit nodes?
This means we can support SIP calling over Tor, video conference and
streaming, among other applications.

@_author: Nathan Freitas 
@_subject: [tor-talk] using UDPGW and tun2socks over Tor 
Thanks for the feedback. We aren't using OpenVPN itself really, just
standard SOCKS for TCP, and then UDP tunneled inside of that SOCKS
connection using this udpgw-client/daemon system.
The VPN code that is part of the solution is more of a local loopback
capability for Android that allows us to intercept that packets.

I am working on improving our ability to do more thorough and

come up with a simple filternet configuration based on OpenWRT, running
on a TP Link MR3020.
Currently, I have this working:
- Use Dnsmasq to block high profile target domains (torproject.org,
google, facebook, twitter, whatsapp, etc)
- Block all HTTPS traffic (port 443)
This simulates most of the common DNS poisoning and port blocking types
attacks, though Tor can still easily connect at this point.
I would like the ability to simulate a more severe environment, where
for instance, Tor itself is targeted, and bridges are required. Any
thoughts or experience doing this?
- Block IPs/domains for known Tor Authority nodes
- block based on Tor protocol characteristics: ssl certs, common ports, etc

Yes, that page is very out of date and needs to be updated. It wasn't a
bug originally, but when Mozilla started moving more code over to
Android/Java domain, they introduced it. I am making it a priority to
make sure it is accurate. We have also removed the Proxy Mobile add-on
from the Mozilla Add-on store awhile ago, when the favicon leak issue
was discovered.
We have also had a variety of issues with successful proxying of
third-party web browser / engines on Android, including various bugs
with WebView/WebKit proxying depending upon the Android OS version or
device type you are running.
Hmm... "Tor Everything" should work if you have a rooted Android device
with a kernel that supports iptables properly. Also, if you haven't seen
Mike Perry's post on Android hardening/tuning, please read it:
Which Android OS are you running, and which version of Orbot? Have you
tried the latest "Apps VPN" feature that tunnels all device traffic
through Tor without root?
Yes, for Wifi connections this will work reliably.
I think running CyanogenMOD or a similar rom, and using transparent
proxying, either by app or all, on boot, and optionally with Mike's
extra hardening, is the most complete solution. If you don't want to go that far, then the Apps VPN feature feature
should do, or manually setting the wifi proxy as you have.
Finally, if you use Orweb (super basic) or Lightning Browser (most
features you want), there is no favicon or other leakage.

2) Add more clear documentation about when WebView/WebKit apps like
Orweb or Lightning are safe to use (on Android 4.3 and higher, etc)
That is the way to do it (click Apps first, then start Tor). Make sure
to disable all root, transparent proxying options, and also flush/remove
all transproxy rules in the "Debug" section of Orbot settings.
No root is needed for this method.
You don't need any proxy config, correct.

We are still working our way through all the permissions that Firefox

The above permissions are mostly related to the Firefox Marketplace
"Apps" they offer which provide a way to run HTML5 apps directly from
the Android launcher. We don't plan to support these in Orfox, so we
likely remove these permissions.
These again are related to some new enhanced wifi behavior that Firefox
has been working on, that doesn't make sense for Orfox. These will
likely go away before we reach RC.
Still sorting that out, but I think that permissions is for importing
old browser bookmarks into Firefox. I thought that one had been removed,

for your device, or just for Orfox/Firefox for Android? I think it is
the latter, and it is not a leak.
Trust me when I say that the work we have done here is way beyond Orweb
in many ways. Orweb didn't allow us to change the user-agent and accept
headers fully. With Orfox, we are using the fully compiled Gecko engine
from Tor Browser source. The few areas that differ are ones like this, where we made a choice to
have mobile web access be the default, based on this user-agent.

We could definitely implement this for the Orbot VPN via the tun2socks

to the hardware-isolated TorSocks mode for sure, which I think have been
lost with some of the poor implementations out there and focus on the
Transparent proxy type setup.
These kind of trade offs are also something we struggle with on Android
with Orbot, and we are looking at configuration choices like these to
both help the novice user get connected, without unintentionally leaking

He specifically points out that very issue with transparent proxying in
the post, and actually recommends the TorSocks mode, which blocks all
traffic that isn't specifically using the Tor SOCKS port.
His premise is sound that by physically isolating the Tor runtime
process away from the average person's insecure laptop, smartphone or
tablet, you are decreasing the likelihood that Tor can be tampered with.
I think we all need to stop thinking that "Tor on a hardware device"
automatically means Transparent Proxying of all traffic.

We chose not to do this, because you can use Orbot standalone for many
other apps. You don't want every app on your phone that wants to use Tor
to have to run their own instance, as it would eat up battery and
network. We are seeing more and more apps, like Facebook, DuckDuckGo,
OpenKeychain, Conversations, ChatSecure, etc support proxying through
Tor with Orbot.
In addition, Android provides a very good inter-app
communication/coordination mechanism through intents and remote
services, that isn't really possible in a cross-platform way on
desktops. On iPhone there
Onion Browser has to build in Tor because iOS doesn't allow for
background services generally.

I would call that an unofficial formal project, but yes, really happy
that project is happening. I think it is the right approach.
Most of our energy got taken up with Orfox / Tor Browser and Pluggable
Transport porting, as well as work on the secure camera project, and our
new effort on mobile developer infrastructure,
deterministic/reproduceability and so on. All of this ultimately
contributes to projects like TOMY and MIA, but for now the idea of
booting a TAILS-like experience from an SD or USB drive is still not
widely practical.
A few more related, interesting ideas:
No secrets, just many smart people chipping away at a very big problem.
I think some of us have also been thinking about whether Android is the
best solution to build upon, or if we should look towards booting TAILS
on Windows Mobile hardware, or an Ubuntu mobile type solution (Qubes
Mobile?), or even maybe something based on Pi Zero or Project CHIP
device. Thanks for keeping hope alive, and keeping the interest going. I think
MIA on a Moto, Nexus or 1+1 is the best turnkey option right now.

Thanks for the report, Dash, and sorry you are having issues. It does
seem your setup is pretty complex (Droidwall plus transproxy AND a
VPN?!), but if it worked before it should now.
We didn't radically change anything with how the Tor ports are setup
between the Orbot v15.0.x branch and this one, but I will take another
look to see if something subtle was modified.
Orbot still uses 9050, 9051 and 5400. Not sure why you aren't seeing
those as the defaults.
I really don't understand how Orbot or Droidwalls iptables rules are
co-existing with Android VPN. This is really a new one for me. I will
make sure transproxy is working on Android 5.1 though, so that at least
we can be sure we didn't break anything.
That is strange. It shouldn't ignore that. This is configured in the
Orbot individual settings values, or through torrc entries?
Can you just clarify what you mean my your configuration? Is that via
Orbot settings, or a torrc file somewhere?
Point taken.
There is GeoIP but it only unpacks it from the APK if you specify rules
in Orbot settings that need it. Again, you are hand modifying the torrc
file which isn't our expected method of use. We are trying to save
space, and made an assumption. If you enter any value in Orbot's exit
nodes field, it will notice that and unpack our bundled GeoIP files.
This is not an Orbot specific issue though, right?
Again, Tor and not Orbot, but yes, that would be useful!
Thanks for the very detailed notes. I will try to reproduce what you are

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Orbot v15.1.0 Alpha 1 
That's great, and yeah, we should probably improve our transproxy
feature, though with things like Orwall and Droidwall, as well as our
VPN feature, it has become less of a focus recently.
I've made changes in Orbot now so that if you don't have the transproxy
feature enabled, it won't write any related settings. This means you can
override it with your own now more easily.
DNSPort is also now not specified unless you have Orbot's transproxy
enabled. This means you can override it.
There may have been some bugs in the last build that were causing this.
Again, it now won't set DNSPort or TransPort if you don't have
transproxy enabled, and you can manual set them in the "Torrc Custom
Config" field, or even modify the default torrc file on disk. I have
also made some changes related to using the Orbot settings properly, if
you do have transproxy enabled in the app, but that shouldn't matter for
you now.
Okay, this is now changed, as well. Since we now show an easy exit
country selector option, it is more likely these files are needed
Agreed that Tor's ability to deal with network changes is quite
admirable, and one of the many reasons why it makes sense on mobile
networks and devices.
Stay tuned for our next beta update.

too quick to push people who only want circumvention, and not anonymity,
away from using Tor. Also, increasingly with DPI / traffic

China, and thus the VPNs are adopting traffic obfuscation methods like
Meek and ObfsProxy as part of their software.

New users of Orfox (Tor Browser on Android) say that it feels faster
than the normal web. This is true, on mobile especially, because by
default, we block all javascript with no-script. This indeed makes the
loading of a web page faster, if you have a reasonably well performing
In addition, many mobile apps use an asynchronous data fetch model, that
removes all connection between the user experience and the network stack
- Facebook, for instance, being one of these. If you enable the Orbot
routing feature in Facebook on Android, you hardly can feel any
difference, since the time it takes to sync new data into your timeline
is hidden from the user.

Glad to hear.
We hadn't considered that people would put their own files into that
directory. When we upgrade, we like to ensure it is in a clean state. We
can consider instead deleting files one by one.
Could you provide these in a pull request or via a safe download link so
we can upgrade Orbot for everyone?
Right. We didn't consider people would use the torrc to modify values
that Orbot itself manages. Are you writing your own torrc.custom on
disk, or adding your configuration to the field in Orbot settings?
It takes time for us to test tor binaries on Android to ensure there are
no unintended issues with performance, battery life, memory usage, etc.
It isn't automatic.
That said, you are free to compile it yourself. All of the information
is on the code repo:
That said, we should be getting to the latest tor RC/stable soon.
Bloody hideous? It is just a small version of the larger icon we use on

I'm sorry your emails were lost in the mix. You sent them when we were
all at the last Tor Developer meeting, and then I (who respond to most
of the Orbot support emails), got quite sick for the next week.
Otherwise, making statements like "does not seem to be supporting Orbot"
are never really helpful. Regardless, I will do what I can to help you
It seems like your RCA tablet has general issues with installing
software. I am not sure what the factory resets were for, or why you are
downloading the APKs directly, but I assume you don't have Google Play
installed or are not using it? That's fine, but at least you should use F-Droid, a free decentralized
open-source app store system, which will help you get the right
software. You can get it here  and if you open the
menu, you will see a repositories menu where you can enable the Guardian
Project official releases repo. Refresh the apps, and you can find Orbot
and Orfox in there.
Otherwise, direct download is fine, but then you have to remember to
upgrade the apps manually yourself. You can find the APK here:
or Right. Your traffic is routing through the Tor network, but you are
using it with the standard browser on your Android device. They are not
contradictory statements. Your IP is being protected at the network
level, but the browser could be exploited through Javascript, plugins or
other attacks if someone was targeting you. We offer the VPN mode for enabling apps that don't know about Tor to be
able to get through firewalls and filters on the network.
If you want to browse the web through Tor, please use Orfox.
The answer is use Orfox. Don't use the system browser. This is an issue beyond what we can offer. What we support here is using
Tor on Android, not securing the entire operating system.
I think I have covered this above.
You can also install apps like DuckDuckGo, Courier, ChatSecure,
Lightning Browser and many others that support the use of Orbot or other
proxy servers directly as part of their options.
To be honest, you seem to have bought a tablet that is cheap but not
very popular. If you want to run a device with a more secure version of Android, then
you should either get a Nexus 7 and follow this post:
or get a Nexus 5, 5x or 6P and install Copperhead on it:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Could Tor be used for health informatics? 
I think the benefit of being able to run Onion services deep within a
firewalled network without exposing public Internet IPs is an
operational security value that outweighs the strength of the crypto. If
you add in the extra hidden service authentication feature, it also
means the Onion service is not even reachable unless you have been given
the extra special secret cookie/token through another channel.
It is these aspects of Onion services that have drawn me to them for use
in IoT applications, and I think they are relevant to the exchange of
sensitive health data, as well.

now in plaintext... (sorry new install of Thunderbird had HTML enabled)
Since I first announced the available of Orbot: Tor for Android about 8
years ago (wow!), myself and others have been working on various methods
in which to make the capabilities of Tor available through the operating
system. This post is to announce that as of the next, imminent release,
Orbot v15.5, we will no longer be supporting the Root-required
“Transproxy” method. This is due to many reasons.
First, it turns out that allowing applications to get “root” access on
your device seems like a good idea, it can also be seen as huge security
hole. I am on the fence myself, but considering that the ability to
access root features hasn’t been standardized as part of Android, which
8 years ago I hoped it would, it means there are a whole variety of ways
that this capability is managed and safeguarded (or not, in most cases).
At this point in time, given the sophistication we are seeing mobile
malware and rootkits, it seems like a capability that we did not want to
focus time and energy on promoting.
Second, for those who do want to use root features, and know what they
are doing, there are a bunch of other apps that do that job better than
Orbot did. I admit, we let our code in that area degrade a bit, as the
dev team themselves moved away from phones with root features. So,
instead, if you really want to do cool things with iptables rules, you
can use AFWall+, available on F-Droid and Google Play.
In order to make AFWall+ work with Orbot, you can follow Mike Perry’s
excellent “Mission Impossible Android” guide in which he provides
“DroidWall Scripts” necessary to enable automatic Tor routing on boot.
You can also check out the sadly no longer maintained, but useful,
Orwall app which was meant to take on all the root features of Orbot.
Third, we really, really think it is a bad idea to just send all of the
traffic of your device through the Tor network. While it sounds like a
great idea in theory, much like many “magical” Tor router kickstarter
projects, it turns out that unless you can be assured an app is using
TLS properly, then there is a chance that bad things could happen to
your traffic as it exits the Tor network. Rather than promote some kind
of auto-magical “enable Tor for my whole device”, we want to focus on
ways to enable specific apps to go through Tor, in a way we can ensure
is as safe as possible.
For instance, we now have an excellent browser app, Orfox, that is based
on Tor Browser, and works perfectly with Orbot. If you just want to
access the web and onion services, like the new New York Times onion at
 then just use Orfox. There is no
need for any fancy rooting or transproxying. There are also many others
that supporting routing through Orbot directly, such as
Conversations.im, Facebook for Android, DuckDuckGo, F-Droid, OpenArchive
and many more to come! If you are interested in enabling your app to
work with Orbot, check out our NetCipher SDK, which makes it easy to do
just that.
Fourth, Orbot has for some time supported use of Android’s VPN features
as a way to tunnel traffic through Tor. You just open the left-side
menu, and tap “Apps VPN Mode” or tap on “Apps…” on the main screen.
Choose the apps you want to run through Tor, press the back button, and
then the VPN will start up, rerouting outbound traffic back through the
local Tor port. This method is 100% support by Android, and requires no
vulnerabilities or exploits of your device to gain root access.
Orbot Apps VPN view, home screen with Apps… button, and VPN sidebar
I know that even with all of these justifications, some users will be
disappointed with the fact we have removed root features from Orbot.
Perhaps that will motivate some to reignite development of Orwall, or
maybe help us make the VPN features in Orbot work even better. Another
route is to support the Tor’s Android phone prototype or perhaps
integrate Tor “root” features directly into a community Android OS
project like Copperhead or Legacy. We would be happy to see all of these
For us, though, removing root means we can focus on making Orbot more
streamlined, more stable, and more compatible with Android, for our 2
million+ active users, who are mostly focused on finding an easy
solution for unblocking sites and apps, and allowing them to communicate
and browse freely without fear of reprisal.

Nice work! Any interest on doing any performance test comparison against
the native/C tor daemon.
With Orbot, I've definitely been interested in having a extremely
lightweight minimal version of the app, that is pure Java. I know there
are also many still interested in tor-ifying their apps, but without the
3-7MB tax that using native code adds.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot v16 (16.0.0-RC-2) is out 
Hash: SHA1
Orbot v16 is out:
Orbot: Tor for Android has a new release (tag and changelog), with a
major update to the user experience and interface. This is the 16th
major release of Orbot, since it was launched in late 2009.
The main screen of the app now looks quite different, with all the major
features and functions exposed for easy access. We have also added a new
onboarding setup wizard for first time users, that assists with
configuring connections to the Tor network for users in places where Tor
itself is blocked. This release also continues to support users looking
to use Orbot to unblock specific apps, that may not be available on
their network or country. From the main screen, users can activate
Orbot’s built-in VPN feature, and easily choose which specific apps they
want to be routed over the Tor network. You can also refresh your Tor
identity, rebuilding all circuit connections through the network, using
the circular reload icon in the expanded notification provided by Orbot.
The update is rolling out on Google Play, and will also be available on
Guardian Project’s F-Droid Repo soon. You can also find Android APKs on

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anonymity and Voip 
Mumble works great over Tor. On Android, you can use Plumble, and it
works directly with Orbot, Tor for Android.
In general, the issue with VoIP over Tor, is that Tor only supports TCP,
and not UDP, which most voice and video services require.

@_date: 2018-05-09 10:59:03
@_author: Nathan Freitas 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Anonymity and Voip 
One important point though, is that Mumble does NOT have end-to-end
encryption. This means you need to trust whoever is running the Mumble
onion server. The good news is that, as an Onion, you can run it on a
laptop, anywhere, and don't need a fixed server.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Orbot 16.0.2-BETA-1 with Tor 0.3.3.5-RC 
Organization: Guardian Project
Orbot 16.0.2-BETA-1 with Tor 0.3.3.5-RC is out. Please test!
We are now using the "split APK" build method to automatically generate
seperate APKs for armeabi and x86, as well as a universal APK. We are
also now using proguard optimizations on the release builds.
This allows us to get the size down for the per architecture APK files
to under 10MB, which means it will be included in the Play Store for
Android Go devices. It is also just a general goal of ours to not follow
the trend of bigger and bigger apps, and to instead, be considerate of
those with the least amount of mobile data and storage.
Otherwise, this build includes:
- A new, more reliable method of installing all the various binaries
- Added "new identity" aka "newnym" menu button on main screen
- Improved language selector (no more random swahili)
- No more Polipo, now using Tor's build in HTTP proxy
- and all the latest improvements from Tor 0.3.3.5

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot: Over 20 Million Served, Ready for the Next Billion 
Orbot: Over 20 Million Served, Ready for the Next Billion
We recently published the latest release of Orbot (16.0.2!), and as
usual, we make it available via Google Play, as well F-Droid, and
through direct download on our website. Whether we like it or not,
Google keeps tracks of things like total installs and active installs
(i.e. not uninstalled), and reports on that for us through their
dashboard. While publishing this release, we noticed a milestone that
made us a bit proud… so pardon this humblebrag.
Since we release Orbot roughly 8 years ago, it has been installed more
than 20 million times, by people from hundreds of different countries
and walks of life. Even better, we have cross the 2 million active user
mark, with growing adoption in many “mobile first” parts of the world.
Of course, none of this would be possible without Tor Project itself, at
the core of what we do, and empowering us through the years, to pave the
way on free, open, mobile circumvention. We are also especially excited
about the direction things are headed with Tor’s new executive director,
Isabela Bagueros.
That is because Isa understands that the vast majority of the world,
including her home country of Brazil, accesses the internet using
smartphones, which essentially include surveillance, censorship and
privacy invasion as core features. Fortunately, she shares our optimism
that with the right software and service, we can fight back against this
and provide working solutions for human rights defenders, activists,
journalists and everyday people. We are really excited about Tor’s new
mobile initiative and their new stewardship of Orfox (soon to be Tor
browser for Android!). Also, if you didn’t know Isa is the one
responsible for Twitter adding proxy features into their Android app
many years ago!
With that global population in mind, we’ve focused this latest release
of Orbot on size and efficiency, with the goal of making the app less
than 10 megabytes in size. This 10MB limit qualifies Orbot to be
promoted to Android Go devices, which is Google’s attempt to serve “the
next billion”. You might have heard about lightweight “Go” editions of
apps like YouTube, that are both smaller in size, and have features that
enable data saving and offline use. With Orbot, we have started by
focusing on reducing our binary size (which adds up over time with
regular updates, etc), to reduce it by nearly 1/3, instead of just
letting it grow bigger and bigger with each release. Over the next year,
we will be working with the core Tor team to improve the core efficiency
of the service running on mobile architectures, and to implement new
features for data management, battery saving and more.
A deep, onion-infused thank you to the multitudes who have helped us get
to this point. We couldn’t have done it with out all of your patches,
bug reports, complaints, praise, donations and encouragement. Now, let’s
keep it up until we get to the billion install mark!

Agreed. It is good to celebrate milestones to ensure we keep our energy and optimism up. Most of the time, however, we keep our heads down, and focus on quality. I have been actively maintaining Orbot for 9 years, so keep hope alive!

@_subject: [tor-talk] How can Orbot for Android contact me? 
Hi, Seth. I can try to help you, but I am not quite sure what you are
asking for.
Orbot is an app that runs on an Android device, like a phone, tablet or
You can configure it through the app itself. It will tell you if you
successfully connect or not. There is no need for it to send you an SMS
or email.
If you want the most "fullproof" solution, use Orbot only with the Orfox
browser (or the new Tor Browser for Android currently in alpha release).

You can still do this today but with the Plumble android app and any Mumble protocol server. You can also do this with Signal over Orbot - voice calls don't work since they are UDP, but voice messages work just fine!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Nice to meet you! / WhatsApp by Tor? 
Since WhatsApp is executable code on your Android phone, it can access
information about your device directly. This includes accessing your
"real" IP address through local network information APIs.
Orbot was not designed to protect apps on your phone from accessing the
IP address of your device.
An app like Signal or Telegram, which both have open source clients, are
much more likely candidates to use as apps that don't lookup/track your
local IP address.

@_author: Nathan Freitas 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Nice to meet you! / WhatsApp by Tor? 
Agreed. What I am saying is that if your adversary (WhatsApp/Facebook)
can execute code on your device, in the form of the app, then they can
access your actual IP address, actual phone number, IMSI/IMEI and other
unique global identifiers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Heads up: Orfox "RIP" EOL is coming, moving to TBA! 
Organisation: 	Guardian Project
We will be officially announcing the end of Orfox this week, by
releasing a final update to the 1.2 million active users of Orfox on
Google Play and F-Droid. We haven't kept Orfox up to date with Firefox
or Tor Browser fixes, so we must bring it to a forced end. Besides, TBA
is looking good and working great, so anyone who wants Tor Browser on
Android should use it.
This "OrfoxRIP" app will replace the existing Orfox app:
If you have Orfox still installed, please try installing it over what
you have, and let me know if you have any issues.
Download the APK:
Otherwise, you can see the discussion and design work on this ticket:

Actually, this is the best place for quick response:
 or email to
suppot at guardianproject.info
That said, we will need more details. The beauty of Android is also the
pain - the insane diversity of OS versions, community ROMs, hardware
types, unexpected task killing background services, and more.
For the vast majority of Orbot users, it is working, but Hack3rcon at
Yahoo, we do want to help you, too!

If you are looking for some fantastic medium-length listens this week
that feature fantastic members of the Internet Freedom community, well,
search no more!
We've recorded three episodes in the last two weeks during our Clean
Insights Symposium Extraordinaire, that are available to you, free of
charge and free of surveillance (we host the feed and mp3's on
Mayfirst.org). You can listen directly via the links below, RSS feed, or
in your favorite podcasting app (which will potentially track exactly
what you are listening to, how long, from where, etc):

Project, Simply Secure and Okthanks"
Amazing designers talk about data, people and dignity!
May 20 "Clean Insights: Prof. James Mickens and Dr. Gina Helfrich on
Ethics in Computer Science"
Do Deep Fakes matter because they can fulfill childhood dreams of
photorealistic Godzilla or an Avengers movie starring Gandi? Is tracking
the heck out of your users fine, as long as it is you doing the
tracking, or should ethical analytics mean more than self-hosting? How
can we address the often myopic industry and academia to have fewer tech
blind spots? We discuss these things and more!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser for advanced users on Android 
This is definitely something we've been talking about awhile, between
the Guardian Project and Tor Browser team.
The good news is that with recent improvements of Tor "idle" features,
there should be very little battery consumption when tor is not in use.
No longer is the daemon constantly creating new circuits if you aren't
asking for them, for instance.
Similarly, with Tor Browser, you really only need the Tor service
instance running when the browser itself is in the foreground. Work is
underway and continues so that tor can bootstrap more quickly, so that
the user doesn't perceive any delay if tor has been shutdown when you
leave the browser.
Lastly, Hans from the Guardian Project team, continues to work on a more
invisible "Tor Service" daemon, that could be installed much like
"Google Play Services", and used by any app or service in a safe, shared
way. We have more work to do here on security risks and threats for
sure, but it is a promising direction.
? Nathan
