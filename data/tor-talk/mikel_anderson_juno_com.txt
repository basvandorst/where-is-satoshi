@_subject: tor-browser bundle on XP 
I've recently started experimenting with the tor-browser bundle.  I have successfully installed and used it on my XP administrator account but find it doesn't work on my limited-user accounts.  Specifically, the Vidalia control panel status reads, "connecting to a relay directory failed(no route to host)".  Is this due to the lack of administrator rights?  Is there a workaround?

failure is reported?
  vidalia.exe -loglevel notice -logfile log.txt
Thanks coderman, but I'm not running from a command line.  I double-click the "Start Tor Browser.exe" icon in my Tor Browser folder.  This start Vidalia, TOR, Polipo, and a special version of firefox browser w/torbutton.  However,  I can access and save the message log from the vidalia control panel.  Shall I attach the log file I saved or c&p it into my next reply?

:TBB is designed to work without admin privileges.  And by install, you
mean extract, as there is no installation procedure. If you "installed" it as an Admin and then tried to run it as a non-admin, you might run into trouble.
You're quite right, Andrew, I did extract it (see my reply to coderman).  I ran the TB executable from my admin account first to ensure I could program my NIS2005 firewall to allow access to all required components.

Thanks for the head-up about Xerobank.  It appears Xerobank is an improvement on TBB.  Here is a link to a review/comparison of the two products:
    Hopefully, this will answer many of your questions.  Note 1: I'm assuming TBB and TorPark are essentially the same thing.  Note 2: The linked review is over a year old, so further investigation is advised.

Andrew, this is incorrect.  Xerobank xB, preconfigured(in free mode) to use the tor network, is available for download at:  I'll defer to you on the rest because you were talking about Xerobank's commercial xB, preconfigured to use their fee-based onyx network.  I can tell you take a great deal of pride in TBB and I certainly meant no disrespect.
My biggest concern with fee-based products/services, in general, is trusting any corporation with customer data no matter how reassuring their privacy policy seems.  My biggest concern with TBB is the old version of the modified firefox browser may expose users to security risks.  That is why free-mode xB may just offer the best of both worlds.

Andrew, All in all, a very interesting discussion.  Thank you.

I understand and agree about getting too close to the bleeding-edge.  I look forward to TBB w/FF3, with anticipation.  Thank you for all your hard work.

Specifically, the Vidalia control panel status reads, "connecting to a relay directory failed(no route to host)". : How limited is this account?  I setup a non-admin user, started up TBB, it connects and works just fine.  Did you use the MS admin tools to further restrict the account?
As far as I know all my limited accounts are standard non-admin.  I did not use MS admin tools to further restrict them.  However, I set up NIS2005 user accounts at the same time and tied each one to its corresponding MS account.  My understanding is the NIS accounts are primarily for parental control but I suppose they could be interfering with NBB.  The two accounts that fail to launch NBB are both set at Adult level (only Supervisor level has less restriction).
: The problem is here:
: "Jan 15 22:12:10.843 [Warning] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 5%:
Connecting to directory server. (Socket is not connected [WSAENOTCONN ];NOROUTE; count 1;+recommendation warn)"
: You can't open a socket to even talk to anything, which implies something locally is not allowing the account to use tcp/ip.
Since it works on my supervisor account it seems unlikely tcp/ip is being blocked.  But I could be wrong.  I need to take a closer look at how NIS handles things.

Well I'll be a monkey's uncle!  Turns out both non-admin accounts had their NIS accounts set to the more restrictive Teenager level.  TBB was stalled waiting to be granted access by the NIS firewall.  Adult level users are notified about each request and may grant or deny each one.  Users with more restrictive levels are not even notified.
Even with the correct account levels systems like mine are going to leave tracks in the firewall.  TBB leaves a set of three tracks(tor, firefox, and polipo) for each user account on which it is successfully run.
Furthermore, this demonstrates how easy it would be to block the use of portable browsers on any kind of public computer.
