I dont think so.
Its a different namespace.
Books and an Nymip System...no chance to mix it.

@_subject: Polipo-20060823 native Windows binary 
I tested it under WinXP SP2 and it worked fine (even with SOCKS4a
support and Tor-upstream).
Although I am not using Windows regularly, I can tell it worked fine for
this short-term-usage.

@_subject: Announcement: 23C3 Onion Corner 
Hello guys,
a gathering of Tor dev's and hackers will take place at the 23C3 at the end
of this year in Berlin/Germany.
For more information about the 23C3 see
We want to discuss about Privacy-Enhancement Technologies and our
beloved toy, The onion router and its internals.
I will setup a place called "Onion Corner", watch out for large onions ;)
Infrastructure like switch ports, coffee machine etcpp is available
there. (suggestions are welcome)
There will be no special fee, all you have to care for is the
entrance to the 23C3.
See you there,

I have a connection problem with hidden services.
E.g. I try to connect to the Hidden Wiki ( or
to another hosted onion site (
Both wont work out.
I collected these Logfile entries:

Received response from directory server '86.59.21.38:80': 404 "Not found"

Resolves perfectly here at my site.
Try another DNS, e.g. 85.88.6.171

@_subject: confiscating middleman-tor-nodes 
They do, as do the authories in other countries, too.
Looks like the fun time for the law hackers and nerds started :)
Hopefully there will be a report afterwards on ChillingEffects.
On the technical side:
Operators should enforce the operational security on their nodes.

@_subject: Bandwith donation for some days ? 
The IPv4 Space will be something like that, correct.
It can be compared to the Congress, although the Bandwdith cannot be that large due to the location (outskirts of Berlin) and the wireless internet uplink.
