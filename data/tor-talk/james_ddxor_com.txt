Hello all
I saw a thread a while ago about a user trying to access Gmail IMAP via
Thunderbird+TorBirdy and getting connections refused.
A Google engineer replied and suggested two steps to establish a `known
good association` with Gmail+Tor.
I have the same issue - with connections being refused when using TorBirdy
- and followed those two steps to no avail.
Has anything changed with Gmail, or is that engineer by any chance on-list
and able to look at my Google Apps for Work support ticket regarding this
Many thanks

`using Two-Factor Authentication (mobile phone) and
assigning an Application password to Thunderbird`
I have used 2FA since creating my account and created an application
specific password for Thunderbird (icedove actually). Still, the issue

 using Tor browser I can
now connect to my account via TorBirdy.
Problem solved.

????? ???????:
Well, that's a good question.
Firstly I'll say that I don't mind Google knowing who I am. (In fact, my
domain name is registered in my own name, so trying to hide my identify
for any mail originating from this address would be pointless.)
So the question remains, what is the purpose of using Tor when my
service provider already knows my identity?
The answer is that I think that identity is only one piece of the larger
privacy issue. In my case I'm not trying to keep my identity private.
However, I don't particularly like the idea that any ISP I use is likely
logging when, where and how often I check my e-mail. So for the purpose
of avoiding some dragnet meta data collection, I use TorBirdy.

Isn't there merit to the idea of moving as much over tor as possible so as to work towards dispelling the myth of tor as a network that only transmits questionable traffic?
Irregardless of the political and privacy issues there are also technical benefits to using Tor for day to day traffic.

But, for a practical non-future-speculative use-case: what if you're
What's interesting to me here is that you've phrased this as a "what if"
question - and, my answer is, "if I want to do this, I will fire up Tor, or
some other Proxy Network"
I _really_ hope that people are better than thinking this is an
all-or-nothing, zero-sum game; that for one network protocol to live, the
other network protocol must die.
We can (and do!) have _both_ anon, and non-anon connections.
And that's _okay_.
That would be coolness.
So: who knows someone at Github to approach about setting up an Onion site
for them?
I'll help.  :-)

Just to play devil's advocate; I see you've listed the benefits, but to make this a more rounded proposal, what about the drawbacks?

Could you give a bit of background and context to the post? It's not clear for me what problem you're solving and how you're solving it. I mean, you outline some software and configuration, but what are you doing?
Also, there are others methods by which to bypass censorship [1] that do not require access to the torproject.org website. [1]
