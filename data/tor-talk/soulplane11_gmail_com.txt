Is it ok to use the Tor Browser without Tor? I don't need Tor but I like

Yesterday I received a security alert that Firefox ESR was updated to 24.3.
I am wondering if since Tor Browser is based on Firefox ESR it is now
subject to security vulnerabilities? When you release the Tor Browser
Bundle do you identify the version (24.2, 24.3,etc) of Firefox that it is
based on?
When Firefox patches vulnerabilities in the ESR product and makes a new
release do you do the same? I took a look at the git for Tor Browser and I
can't tell whether or not it integrates whatever changes are in Firefox

@_subject: [tor-talk] Newbie with a bunch of questions for Tor Cloud 
I would like to set up a Tor bridge in the Amazon cloud. I have read the
project page at cloud.torproject.org and I think I can do this at little to
no cost based on what I've read. Amazon just sent me a $50 credit because I
signed up to AWS but never used it so maybe I can use that to cover any
overages. Did anyone else get one of those coupons?
More questions:
Why is the only region available for the Tor images us-east virginia? I
thought I could use the free tier in other places. Wouldn't it be better to
vary the regions instead of sticking them all in one place?
And also wouldn't it be better to vary the OS and images in case there is a
vulnerability in one, the rest of the ecosystem using different OSs are ok?
I read in Tor Weekly News today that the obfs3 protocol is vulnerable to
active probing attacks and there is a replacement ScrambleSuit. If I setup
the AWS Obfsproxy image now does that mean the Chinese can detect it and
block it? Is that image obfs2 or 3 or both? Should I just wait until
ScrambleSuit is supported, or can I modify the config file to only use
ScrambleSuit, or is that not a good idea at this point? I don't want to run
something that nobody is going to be able to use because governments can
just detect it and block it.
Is Tor obfuscation specifically more likely to come under attack from
repressive governments?
How is security handled. For example suppose there's a known vulnerability
in Tor or Ubuntu does the server shut down until it's fixed and an update
is available or does the server stay up and risk being hacked? Is there any
notification sent to the AWS administrator in these cases? I would imagine
even a small window is gold for some state run group to break in.
How can I determine the integrity of the server and do I have any
responsibility to do that? Do you guys who are running these instances in
the Tor Cloud just set it and forget it or is there some oversight required?
I would take an active role in securing the instance if necessary but I
need to know what to do. What do you guys do?
Has anyone here built their own Tor setup in EC2 similar to what Tor Cloud

@_author: Soul Plane 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Newbie with a bunch of questions for Tor Cloud 
Thanks, I read the bug and the AWS thread and it looks like there is
something wrong with the image copy process. If I wanted to setup in a
location other than Virginia would I be able to use your build script to do
that or would I run into the same image copy problem? Also I noticed in
ec2-prep.sh you have:
curl -m 5 That address is invalid, what is the reservation id for?
Ok so after I do a build if I want scramblesuit I change this line:
ServerTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy --managed
to this:
ServerTransportPlugin scramblesuit exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy --managed
According to this here I need to update obfsproxy first? Is that relevant
Than regular tor bridges. Are obfs3 bridges special bridges that users in
repressive countries are more likely to use because other bridges are
blocked? Maybe I don't understand.
Ok. Let's say there was a security vulnerability being exploited in Tor
bridges. Is there any warning from Tor staff? Like when there is one in
Flash or Microsoft etc I will get a CERT or a security advisory saying "xxx
is being actively exploited", view such and such a page for more
information. In those cases I will just turn off flash or run the fix it.
Thanks I took a look at the script.
Is there any obfuscation benefit to using random ports, like changing
40872  to 1234 etc.

What happens when a new version of Tor comes out? You want to put this in
the hands of people who really don't know anything about security. To stay
secure wouldn't you or someone have to ensure that all those devices are
using the latest Tor? And how could you do that without access to the
devices? If you leave it up to the end user to do firmware updates most
people probably aren't because they are, like you say, not able to install
Tor on their own. I really don't know if your device is a good idea or a
bad idea but I cringe at what could end up as a false sense of privacy.

@_subject: [tor-talk] So much for using ixquick and Startpage: Now broken 
Does anyone know anyone at startpage, maybe you should CC them this. I just
tried the startpage search box in Iceweasel in Tails and I receive a
message directed at Tor users whenever I try to search. I will paste the
message below. Unfortunately it does not appear just once, it appears every
time and I can't get search results that way. I wouldn't mind answering a
captcha once in a while but I don't know how much that's going to help them
against bots since bots apparently use opencv and tricks to break captchas.
Here is the message, it's long:
Welcome Tor Users!
We are happy to welcome you to Startpage, the world's most private search
engine. Startpage now serves well over 2 million searches per day, making
us the biggest private search service on the Internet.
Like Tor, Startpage was private long before privacy was cool. We have a
fourteen-year company track record, and we are the only search engine that
can back up our privacy promises with third-party certification.
Here are just a few of our powerful, privacy-protecting features:
    We do not record anything about you ? not your IP address, not your
search queries, and we never use tracking cookies.
    We provide 100% Google results ? We submit your search anonymously to
Google and return their results to you in total privacy.
    We encrypt all traffic ? using HTTPS, so even your ISP can't snoop on
your searches.
    We offer a powerful free proxy ? that lets you anonymously view
third-party websites with every search.
    We're third-party certified and independently audited ? by EuroPrise
and Certified Secure, so you can take our privacy promises to the bank.
We love Tor!
We believe in the Tor project and its privacy mission and we applaud your
efforts to pursue serious Internet privacy.
As you know, Tor recently included Startpage as the default search engine
in the new Tor Browser Bundles. Thank you! We're honored to be associated
with all of you like-minded, hard-core privacy fanatics.
Just One Small Catch...
However, the avalanche of new Tor users has created an issue with the
algorithm we use to detect and reject automated screen-scraping programs.
When multiple Tor users are searching through the same end node, Startpage
may wrongly conclude that the searches are coming from a scraper.
The unfortunate result is that Startpage may occasionally not return
results with Tor. But don't panic, we're committed to fixing it.
Here's a Temporary Solution
We are reaching out to the Tor developers to find a permanent solution. In
the meantime, here is a workaround for Tor users:
    If you use the Tor Browser Bundle:
        Switching to a new Tor identity is easy and fast. Click the green
onion icon next to your address bar, then click "New Identity" and try your
search again. In some cases, you may have to switch identities a few times
for this to work.
We want Tor users to have a great private search experience with Startpage,
and we appreciate your patience while we develop a long-term solution. As
you use Startpage, we'd love to hear from you and get your impressions.
Meanwhile, thanks for supporting the vision of Tor and Startpage and a
completely private Internet!

Thanks, I know I can do that but I don't want to do that. Their help page
says  "Both Ixquick and StartPage are compatible with Tor, although use of
VPNs and Proxy services (including Tor) may occasionally trigger our
anti-abuse mechanisms. If so, you will temporarily be presented with a
small warning message, or a request to complete a CAPTCHA before continuing
with your search." [1]
I didn't get captchas and the warning didn't go away. So it seems broken.
It's a block unless you change identities until you get one that works. If
you have to repeatedly change identities doesn't that do something to
lessen anonymity?

I've noticed some websites are blocking or treating Tor users differently,
not always overtly, and while it may not be the most useful topic if that's
a trend that's increasing it may be worthwhile to talk about it and what
your organization is doing or can do about it.
I tried to pay someone using a payment processor in Germany, and they kept
denying my transactions but it was clearly automated and when I asked them
about it they put the orders through manually and the same thing happened.
I tried every payment method (credit card, wire transfer, money transfer
services, paypal) through several different IP addresses using the Tor
Browser just to see what would happen. I think the payment processor was
cleverbridge. There was nothing saying "Hey you're a Tor user you can't use
this method", but any order originating from an IP address connected to Tor
was not accepted. And they just wouldn't say it was due to Tor even though
I explained to them that was probably what was happening since I'd already
been through this with PayPal after they suspended my account for using Tor
(PayPal had cited "proxy services" are against terms of use and I hadn't
accessed any proxy except Tor).
