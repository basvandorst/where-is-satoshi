Hi Hasan,
very simple to receive to by mail. Please follow this
instructions by the tor site:
log in to your Gmail account and mail 'gettor AT torproject.org'. If you
include the word 'help' in the body of the email, it will reply with
instructions. Note that only a few webmail providers are supported,
since they need to be able to receive very large attachments.
Be sure to verify the signature of any package you download, especially
when you get it from somewhere other than our official HTTPS website.

@_subject: [tor-talk] PSI Jabber leaking the client hostname? 
Hash: SHA1
Hello folks,
Early today I was testing a ejabberd server under Tor Hidden service,
while testing the correct configuration of the messenger service
I was looking at the /var/log/ejabberd/ejabberd.log file to spot any
errors or strange alerts.
For the test I used a laptop with Ubuntu and pidgin installed and
a virtual machine with ubuntu and PSI jabber client.
User test1 pidgin
User test2 PSI
This session from pidgin looks fine for me.
Opened session for test1 at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion/41432302741318419318154500
This other session freaked me out, because foobar is the hostname of the
Virtual Machine.
Opened session for test2 at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion/foobar
I guess is not normal to have your hostname going to some tor end point,
is this leak related to PSI or maybe some other misconfiguration.

If you want to use tor at internet cafes, grab the latest
version of Tails and burn it on a cd.

Hash: SHA1
As the hidden services are running inside the tor network, exit-nodes
are not implicated in this attack, they just have exhausted the HTTP
process using some Slowloris attack in conjunction with sql injections
to retrieve the users credential that were using this web sites.

Hash: SHA1
The answer is NO!
anonymous guys have used SQL injection techniques to exploit poorly
configured web services, they didn't crack or exploit the tor protocol.
The claim looks like that every-time a web site is defaced, the internet
is broken or exploited.
I'm I right wrong?
