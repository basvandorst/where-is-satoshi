I'm writing about Tor for my Ethics module. Do you guys mind if you tell
me some malicious uses with Tor? Anything will be of great help. Yeah I
already know of the basic or common use cases. :)
PS. I know this is vague but please ask away for anything you guys are
not clear about or something.

Hi Kevin!
Onion Routing? You mean just not Tor? Do you like the idea of helping
each other out? Could you give me resources or something?

Are most hidden services bad? Are there more bad hidden services?

Which one? Also how do I know when I have to use bridges or pluggable
transports? I have used some before and I noticed my connection got slower.

I'm suppose to write about ethical, social, legal and professional
issues raised by my topic - which is Tor - based off of UK legislation
and standards in Information Systems.

How do I anonymize my phone? Yeah I have heard that phones are tracking
devices. I have to use my phone right now. If I have the money to buy a
replicant compatible phone, I will. I'm running on Android OS and I as
much as possible get my apps from F-droid. I rarely get apps from the
Play Store.

Oh man this sucks! Why isn't StartPage the default search engine anyway?
Can someone link me the back story?
