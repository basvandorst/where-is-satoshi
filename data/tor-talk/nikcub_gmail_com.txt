Blockchain.info has become the second site after Facebook to roll out
a Tor hidden service with a CA signed SSL certificate. You can find it
My blog post explaining some of the background and implementation
details is here:

A few reasons:
1. When they announced the first hidden site on Saturday which was
plain HTTP[0] there was a clone up within an hour and despite the
official blockchain twitter and reddit accounts linking to the onion
others spammed the clone link(s) which lead users asking to what is
2. User expectation - thinking a "legitimate" hidden service should
have a signed and valid certificate [2]
3. The users who were MITM'd on exit nodes weren't noticing they were
being ssl stripped, so the chances of getting them into a usage
pattern of checking a 16 character onion address felt slim -
especially when clones can match the first 10 characters and there is
no browser failure mode for not checking the address
4. To defend against the attack type where an attacker creates a clone
onion with close-enough matching address and then MITM exit nodes
where they s// in all pages the
user visits.
enforced HTTPS everywhere, including onion sites, solves a lot of
problems and keeps user advice consistent. HTTPS and signed
certificates doesn't have to mean paying a CA - i'd like to see TB
distribute a root for a voluntary onion-oriented CA.

We identified 276 onion addresses as being seized as part of Operation
Onymous. Of those, 153 were either scam sites or clones. A number of
phishing or clone version of websites were seized while the real
websites remain live. Full results and list of onion sites:
This suggests that the operation was less targeted than law
enforcement suggested, and was more a sweep of a number of popular
Tor-friendly hosts.

I'll have another post up about that soon, hopefully by early next week. We
have been speaking to a number of the administrators of seized sites to
work out what they had in common and what lead to them being discovered (on
that note, if you were or are the admin of a site that was seized and
haven't spoken to us yet, please get in touch - email, PGP and other
contact details are at A large number of seized sites were IP -> onion,  some were onion -> IP,
but the method involved isn't a new groundbreaking Tor break or something
that can't be fixed with better documentation and awareness.
Apologies for being vague and teasing out the details, but want to be
certain before freaking people out or reassuring them.
If you're interested in details etc. as they come about follow along on
