grarpramp,If Tor only consisted of hidden services, wouldn't this class of traffic-fudging problems go away? (I'm assuming the handful of centralized services most people use would just generate vanity addys.)
-Jonathan  From the exact same thread duplicated a month ago that is worth
reading for what everyone said there:
Assume you have a base set of some web of trusted nodes, which
is then easier/cheaper for an adversary on average...
A) Sybil up enough individual faces that can prove own their node
in person at meetups, give google checkable stories, are networked
in Tor/related communities enough, and pass the human bullshit
detector... to have an effective attack percent of nodes, maintained
as the "legit" node count grows.
B) Pay $/mo per IP to "cooperative" ISP's (or be a shell), to sybil
up nodes you have zero insight into other than an IP address.
Then consider which trust metrics you might use in your config.
Sure, many caveats too, if the above ancient question has an answer,
then so do you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and solidarity against online harassment 
Hi Gregory,Do you stand in solidarity with the Tor devs against online harassment?? A wish to refrain from deflecting a conversation isn't exactly the same thing.
I stand in solidarity with the Tor community against online harassment.? I also wish to point out that I have noticed online harassment of women is particularly ferocious.? It shouldn't be tolerated here or in any free software community.? Thanks for the clear stance in the blog post.
The intensity of the language such as "Further, we will no longer hold
back out of fear or uncertainty from an opportunity to defend a member
of our community online", immediately caused people in two different
communities I'm a member of to express concern that this was basically
a declaration of war and that the Tor Project and the signing parties
might engage in activities like releasing backdoored software in an
effort to return fire.
I was only able to respond that I didn't think that was the case, but
nothing in the document provides a strong basis to support that... and
also pointing out that these people could always be coerced and so
that risk exists regardless of any statements of intent, and so we
must audit and count on the auditing of others.
A counter argument given was that the auditing by others is not
worthwhile when they are also part of the "war".
Is there a similarly strong statement that the software will never be
intentionally backdoored by the same parties that I can point people
to?? I don't wish to deflect from the serious concern about online
harassment, but it seems this statement can easily be misconstrued
(perhaps maliciously) as a statement of abandoning prior values.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and solidarity against online harassment 
Hi Roger,
I'm afraid you're going to continue to hit up against this criticism for the foreseeable future, for the following reasons:
1) The NSA's betrayal of trust on the internet (and its standards) have all but removed good faith from the equation in the minds of a lot of people
2) practically speaking, Tor Browser Bundle _is_ private browsing mode for the time being.  There is no other game in town (at least in terms of usability and being gratis)
So someone looks on your resume and finds a summer at the NSA.  If the wider free software community was adequately funded to sustainably research and protect users privacy, that would be that. Tor would take a temporary hit and Privacy Software B's website would temporarily see more hits and development effort.
In the real world, however, there isn't a Software B.  It will be a long time before even a Debian user can apt-get install and easily use Gnunet.  Non-technical users see a world of NSA surveillance and a single usable, well-maintained piece of software available for anonymous browsing run by people funded by the U.S. government. Conspiracy theories flourish in that type of climate.  And until there are as many (effective) private browsers competing with each other as there are normal browsers, these kinds of attacks will continue to be (at least somewhat) effective.
Anyway, for those who are willing to listen to a little reason and live in a country where encryption isn't illegal, here's a Pascal's wager for Tor Browser Bundle use:
                         Something to hide    Nothing to hide
                         -----------------    ---------------
Tor is a honey-pot:     Tor use is BAD       Tor use is No worse than not using Tor
Tor isn't honey-pot:    Tor use is GOOD      Tor use is GOOD
Of course this doesn't work if Tor use simply lands you in jail, or gets you disappeared by government agents.  But if that is the case you have much bigger issues to deal with than private browsing.

Yes, with two caveats:
* only people with sufficient expertise in network security will audit the system in any meaningful sense
* it excludes the people with sufficient expertise who are under contract _not_ to release the results of their audit or knowledge of exploits to the public
How does the assumption that enough attackers aren't colluding hold up against revelations about the tactics of the Five Eyes?
Either way, it turns out to be extremely difficult to explain that design feature to someone, much less a general audience.  And I don't mean "explain" as in they nod, "oh, right, that's neat."  I mean explain such that they can repeat the essence to someone else and still be technical correct in their description.
Because of that, and because of the toxic atmosphere wide-net surveillance has created, there are a lot of potential Tor users/relay-operators who bail on the idea before even getting to that technical description.  They're not conspiracy theorists-- they're just people who don't get excited about programming cleverness.  We can try to think of more metaphors for them, and make more and more precision-guided arguments against the "I-dont-wanna-help-the-bad-guys" meme.  But we have to remember that isn't nearly as effective as, "you can use Network B run by this other group, and it works in a similar way," or, "even Facebook is using it for location anonymity."
Tor remains a single point of rhetorical attack here.  How convenient that the government-funded overlay enters the flow-diagram once more! troll the trolls.  My point is that the effectiveness of that troll only starts to go away once it is Tor OR Software B that can be combined to distribute trust.
Except when there isn't a viable usable free alternative, in which case the people choosing to steer clear of Tor most likely experience a decrease in privacy.  But as far as the dev effort tides, yes.
I write this restatement of the wager mostly for the people who have nothing to hide.  "I've got nothing to hide, so I might as well take a dip in the anonymity pool."

@_subject: [tor-talk] routing Pure Data messages over Tor 
Hi list,
???? I'm experimenting with sending messages over Tor using the program Pure Data.? Pure Data (or Pd) is a graphical programming environment.? It typically runs two processes-- a tk GUI process, and the "main" process.? The two communicate over the loopback device 127.0.0.1.? (Can't remember which port atm.)
Within the program, there are objects for sending and receiving messages over the net.? So what I can do at the moment is this:
1) run Pd in -nogui mode in conjunction with 'usewithtor'.? (In this mode, the tk GUI process never runs, so there is nothing to communicate over the loopback device.)
2) make a Pd program listen for incoming messages on a hidden service port
3) make a Pd program connect to any onion addy I choose while the program is running (or being built, since Pd is also a realtime IDE), and then send messages to it.
4) of course, make a program that does both simultaneously
That works!
Problem is when I run in gui mode, the GUI needs to talk to the main process over the loopback device.? But when I do 'usewithtor', the loopback device is tied up with Tor, and thus the main process can't communicate with the GUI.
hdm on tor irc kindly suggested using torsocks in conjunction with socat, but the solution required hard-coding an onion addy with socat, and that doesn't work for  above.? (I want the ability to make connections to multiple onion addys at once.)
Right now I'm just trying to chat with a few Pure Data users over Tor.? But Pd is a realtime audio language, so ultimately we might be able to prototype some voice chat progs for use over Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Giving Hidden Services some love 
tldr; this is why Facebook's hidden service is so important.
This has long been a chicken-or-egg problem.  A general audience (i.e., not digital security specialists) must know what hidden services do before they get involved in hosting hidden services (or even using them, for that matter).  But to know what hidden services do, a general audience must be able to use hidden services that interest them.  If there aren't any that interest them, then consequently there's no demand for anyone to create them.  So few people know what they do, outside of "hacking" and "omg darknet".
So yes, an Onion Land with publicly navigable sites that are predominantly shady and disgusting hasn't encouraged public participation.  (No matter how clever the tech is, btw.)  But an Onion Land with publicly navigable sites that are shady and disgusting, _plus_ a few well-known socially expedient services-- well, that's just another way to say "the internet".  Even if it's just the toe-dip of Facebook's location anonymity, that's enough for most people to develop an initial, practical understanding of what the readers of this list know to be one of the fundamental principles of 21st century civil rights.
That logic also provides a nice "golden rule" symmetry for free software privacy advocates.  If you truly grasp the theory behind online anonymity despite all the shady onion sites out there, then congratulations: you understand why a user of a shady service like Facebook also benefits by using it over Tor.  (And how the Tor network benefits from that use, too.)  So when faced with inarticulate skepticism, be lazy: tell people, "Well, Facebook uses it."  Then trust them to take the most important step: to exercise their freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
And who knows, maybe someday they'll modify their behavior and distribute that modified behavior to others.

We're probably talking at cross-purposes.  When I wrote "know what hidden services do", I meant a potential user should know what a hidden service can do to benefit them (or benefit their community). I don't mean that a general audience should understand all the technical details you mention below, nor that Tor docs should try (and fail) to explain those details to a general audience.
For a general audience to understand what hidden services can do for them, there ought to be hidden services available which interest them.  Then users can _use_ the services and learn (in a basic sense) how they work and why they exist.  Otherwise one must explain complex topics which are outside of the user's area of expertise, _plus_ contend with the reality that many of the widely-known hidden services are shady or disgusting.  If you've ever tried to explain the importance of online anonymity to a general audience, you'll understand what a difficulty these two issues present.  It's much more effective to show someone how to browse using Tor, and guide them as they learn for themselves.
If there were a hidden service that interested Dad, that doesn't matter.
Well, it's an anonymity overlay.  Security blanket is probably misleading, as using hidden services aren't inherently more secure, broadly speaking.
As in the above example, both the whistleblower and Dad have some degree of anonymity when the content is posted using a hidden service.  The whistleblower cannot easily post content anonymously on the regular web.
I don't know anything about Meganet.
Let's say you decide to run a relay.  Would you want to click the button that only relays encrypted data within the Tor network (encrypted from _your_ eyes, too), or should you click the button that makes your computer fetch arbitrary pages from the regular web for anonymous Tor users?  Which would you guess requires less risk on your part?
I don't know the answer to that question.
Oh, it most certainly does.  I don't care how accurate you think your map is-- when someone peruses the links on the hidden wiki, the theory behind Tor rubs up against reality and the map gets blurred. Keep in mind some of those links advertise content that can generate the most intense emotional appeals out there.
So please do peruse the myriad responses on this list to the inarticulate outrage over shady and disgusting hidden service content.  Find your favorite response and see how effective it is-- not in "winning" your side of the argument, but in actually reducing people's fears and enabling them to use Tor.  Meanwhile I'll use the end-run of "Facebook uses it", because practicing using a interesting hidden service is IMO the best defense against emotional appeals.
Anyway, if there were a hidden service tailored to the needs of ancient astronaut theorists I'm sure you could grasp all of this in less time than it took me to write a response.

The OP writes about widely known digital surveillance and political then seems to conclude that both are aimed at his own personal activity.
The missing threads that would otherwise connect the two plus the heightened

Mirimir identified one troubling idiosyncracy of this particular conspiracy
theory-- some of the language is not as hyperbolic as it appears on first

moral equivalency between the two, _and_ that it would an exercise in
self-defeat to wait until moral equivalences develop before daring to study

them for ignoring the prohibitive expense of the detour.  As Neil deGrasse
Tyson once said, for as much as it would have cost to fake a moon landing you
might as well just have spent the money to go to the moon.  It would be at
least as expensive to fabricate decades of independent vaccine research however many countries, or for the implications of an erronenous biological
theory to coincidentally be verified across so many disparate fields of But what would it cost the NSA to screw with the devices of a guy running and
distributing scripts for use with Tor?
Like the other respondent, I think it's unlikely the OP devices are being targetted
or exploited, and I suggest the OP seek out therapy to cope with the anxiety created
by believing that they are.  (As well as the vicious cycle I imagine coming from the
virtual smorgasborg of surveillance tactics one can read about from the past year
and a half of leaks.)
But I'd also suggest that after he goes, he comes back here and shares any coping strategies
he learned.  Because until it costs more than nothing to trigger targetted surveillance,
that's essentially what we're all doing.

That would certainly be unfortunate, but it's a publicly known and measurable risk on a public, unmoderated list.  However, if the list were to become moderated (especially according to your vague criteria) then the community would lose the set of evidence they need most (i.e., the moderated content) to argue in the other direction.  In practice, admins who feel the need to moderate are _extremely_ averse to meta-discussions about the guidelines, which makes things even worse.
But even with well-considered, clear moderation guidelines, the very act of removing content of a user on the Tor talk list in the current wide-net surveillance climate... well, I suppose it could decrease the number of button presses in your MUA.  But in the larger scheme I have no doubt the conspiracy theories you find unpleasant would not only proliferate widely but also focus their sights on Tor's tyrannical and hypocritical campaign of online censorship.  If it's a choice between that and you fulfilling a fantasy of Valhalla burning to the ground at your immolation, then the good news is that you only have to press one more button.

Any response from the devs/forum when you reported the bug?
For those unfamiliar with Bitmessage, it is designed so that everyone receives everything.
Within a two-day buffer, at least according to the white paper.
Why does it broadcast in this manner?  Imagine that you wish to read blog entries
of your 10 favorite bloggers, but you're afraid because 2 of the bloggers may be
considered dangerous by your favorite state-sponsored spy agency.
Let's suppose you can choose one of the following methods to read these a) read the blogs as web pages, accessing them through Tor
b) read the blogs by subscribing to Bitmessage mailing lists
If you choose Tor and the spy agency has a _full_ view of the network traffic, then they
can violate your reading privacy.  They could-- for example-- record you as a reader
of the 2 "dangerous" blogs, distinct from users who, say, only read the 8 "harmless"
If you choose to read from Bitmessage mailing list posts and the spy agency has
a _full_ view of the network traffic, they cannot violate your reading privacy wrt the
2 "dangerous" blogs. They can link you to "suspicious activity" due to using
Bitmessage.  But through traffic analysis alone they cannot separate your reading habits
from people who use Bitmessage to only read the 8 "harmless" blogs. To them it
just looks like everyone is downloading the same data.  And because reading a Bitmessage
mailing list doesn't require _any_ special request back to the network, there's no way to tell
from traffic analysis which lists someone happens to be reading.
Bitmessage certainly has its share of issues, but I'm unaware of any other extant piece of
software that has a feature like that.

It just occurred to me how obscure that sentence is.  Let me explain...
When Satoshi (or whoever) released the initial version of Bitcoin, posted to the Crypto List[1].  Hal Finney responded with posts that showed he
a) read the Bitcoin whitepaper, b) read some of the code that Satoshi linked, and
c) ran the Bitcoin daemon to see how it worked. Ben Laurie responded
by posting a link to a paper on the general topic of "proof-of-work" (like Hashcash,
upon which Bitcoin is based) and why he believed it cannot work.
While a general critique of Hashcash probably seemed appropriate at the
time, it completely overlooked central features of Bitcoin's design.  There's a
kind of bikeshedding in those early threads, presumably because it's easier to
discuss the failures of spam prevention than it is read and understand novel
code in C++.  (But even a casual glance at the whitepaper elucidates bootstrapping mechanism, which AFAICT had never been employed or
written about before the Bitcoin whitepaper was posted.)
Given the influx of post-Snowden FLOSS privacy/security apps, I think the only
way forward is to follow Finney's lead and strive for a kind of "proof of
comprehension" in our discussions[2].  Otherwise we're all just picking our favorite
slide from the Snowden leaks to reject 100% of the apps out of hand.  (And
then adding our own efforts to the pile.)

This is so important.
As things stand, it still accurate to categorize Tor as a functioning example of

In theory it shouldn't be an issue, so long as they can't somehow tie the
multiple cookies together.
The problem being there are a wide range of fingerprinting techniques they
could use to do just that. On the flipside though, if they're willing to go
to those lengths then the cookie doesn't add a huge amount of value to
their operation. The potential risks, really, are more a product of one
party being the endpoint for so many sites.
CF claim that cookie is used only to indicate you got past security -
- which is _probably_ true.
If they were setting a third party cookie (e.g. with a domain of
nottrackingyou.cloudflare.com) it'd be a slightly different story, as
they'd then be able to track you across domains, based on that cookie.
data on cookies & IPa's to tracking companies or advertisers.
They sure do. Some go even further -? a little while back Verizon decided
to add a unique (to the subscriber) HTTP header to any outgoing (mobile
IIRC) requests so that their advertising buddies could easily track their
users and generate some revenue. Completely transparent to the user, unless
you happen to take a PCAP at the other end, or visit somewhere that
displays the request headers it received from you.
It had the particularly "pleasant" side-effect, that if you deleted
cookies, when the advertising platform next saw you, it'd set a new one,
pull the UID out of the injected header and link your new ID to the old one.
Selling individual (first-party) cookie details isn't particularly worth
while, even for a large site, as advertisers generally see more profit in
profiling your behaviour as far across the net as possible. IP's are in a
similar position, though I suspect they have some value if you're able to
show one user always visits your site from IP 1.1.1.1 - indicating they
either use a single proxy as a matter of course, or they've got a static IP
on their home connection (ker-ching, easy tracking)
do - just to take a peek, or it won't work right.? Maybe that's because the
cookies can be turned into cash?
That's definitely a driver for some. But, back in the day, most sites were
static and users interaction was largely limited to reading. A lot of sites
today run on content management systems, so will set (at least) a session
cookie in case you try to do something that would require a statefulness
(even if there's nothing like that enabled on the site....). There's also
(IMO) an aspect of laziness/stupidity - you can find sites where the
developer has decided that controlling the theme and page layout is best
done by setting a shedload of cookies and then reading them back with

Hi Griffin,Two questions for the Tor project:1) Do most, some, or any of the core Tor developers espouse the opinion that they cannot or should not go to law enforcement if they are the victim of a crime?2) Is there any peer pressure within the Tor community to convince participants at any level to avoid going to the police for help?
Actually, I'd open up that question to anyone who has worked or  volunteered at Tor.  The Tor Social Contract claims inspiration from the Debian community, but I'm pretty sure most in the Debian community would answer a resounding "no" to both questions.  (Or if they didn't, Debian would view that as an enormous problem and take clear, transparent steps to ensure their developers don't become duct-taped into a corner as martyrs for the cause of freedom.)

Hi Seth,Seeing how the FBI/Apple debacle has given us a perfect laboratory with which to test this hypothesis, you might want to wait for the results  before opining.
You can use pinning with Let's Encrypt certs too.? The default client
behavior changes the subject key on every renewal, but I can add a
feature to keep the old key if you want to pin at the key level.
We don't know how large the risk of legally-compelled misissuance is,
but we have lots of lawyers who would be excited to fight very hard
against it.? I think that makes us a less attractive target than other
CAs that might not find it as objectionable or have as many lawyers
standing by to challenge it.
Remember that (without CA-level pinning) users are always at risk
from misissuance by any CA that they trust, not just the CA that
you specifically chose to use.? For example, google.com was attacked
(successfully at first) with misissued certs from DigiNotar even though
Google had no relationship with DigiNotar at all.
We also publish all of the certs that we issue in Certificate
Transparency.? You can watch the CT logs for your domain or other certs
that you care about.? If you ever see a cert in CT for your domain
that you didn't request, please make a big deal out of it.? Likewise,
if you ever see a valid cert in the wild from Let's Encrypt that doesn't
appear in the CT logs, please make a very big deal out of it.? At some
point it should become possible to get browsers to require inclusion CT
proofs for certs from Let's Encrypt, though we don't have the tools in

I was really hoping that Chaum had devised a way to use proof-of-work to impose a significant cost on deanonymization.? What I mean is that the nine servers would not only have to agree to unlock the backdoor, but that they (or some entity on their behalf) would need to expend a substantial amount of hashing power to actually recover the data that breaks one of the participant's privacy.
In such a system you'd "break the stalemate" by setting the POW to be difficult enough that the cost of breaking the anonymity of all participants exceeds the combined black budgets of the host countries by some factor.
But if math isn't going to be the warden of the system, I don't understand how it could be more secure than Tor.
Also, the bit about "distinct implementations" adding security to the system is a red flag.? Either his protocol is so trivial that it doesn't matter (unlikely), or the "distinct implementations" turn out to increase the attack surface through the complexity of subtle incompatibilities.? At least that's what I've heard from people who do security for a living...

Jon,If Haroon's simplification were to make sense to an audience of people who aren't UX experts, it would be trivial to understand the constraints.  For example, if I say, "explain like I'm five" and my audience uses simple sentence structure and/or pithy metaphors, then I was understood.  If instead they talk in a condescending tone and try to persuade me not to throw a tantrum, I wasn't At the very least, the question, "can my mum use this software?" has the constraint that "mum" is immutable-- her skills are what they are, and her time is limited.  The upshot is that the software, on the other hand, is mutable.  We love "mum" and want her to use our software.  If we imagine she isn't able to use it then it's the software that should change to correct that.  And here we have a respondent who does a complete 180 on the constraints.  Claiming that "mum" just needs to "invest the time" is to do exactly the opposite of what Haroon was implying.  Now it's not the software that should change, but "mum's" priorities!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Audio fingerprinting 
"Audio signature" seems a bit broad.? From what I can tell it could be doing about three things:1) Fingerprint the browser by looking at the antialiasing method its audiocontext implementation uses2) If the browser is branching the antialiasing method based on the machine/processor/etc., then the miner can infer that by looking at the output.3) Measuring the time it takes the machine to generate the output.
It's a javascript api, and if you have javascript turned on there are already way easier ways to get  and  Plus I doubt  would ever be the determining factor in positively ID'ing a machine.
But it's still another bit of data.? When GCC adds a line to output a caret showing the exact column where an error starts, I go, "Oh, that's very nice!" I'm sure the folks at the other end of your request do the same.

It's a bit off-topic, but it's worth keeping in mind what the greater free software community is good at-- like replicating data-- and what it isn't-- like hiding data.
For example-- if you've been afraid to look up something on Wikipedia for fear of typing "those words" into Google or Wikipedia, just download Wikipedia.? They have all the tools and docs to help you do that, with an archive format that probably fits very comfortably in your free hard drive If anyone does this, you'll immediately notice the benefit of the approach: that cover traffic isn't just random data-- it's Wikipedia.? You can use it for future queries regardless of subject matter, with a greater probability of privacy than anything a future cover-traffic network can get There are many other examples out there.? If you spend a little time each week thinking about this approach you'll find it changes how you use the web and internet.? Those changes will affect your values, and if enough people do this it obviously affects what we want and need out of a future cover-traffic network.

Those are solutions of a different kind.? What I'm trying to describe is an "everyone gets everything" private information retrieval approach, but where the "everything" stored on your machine has enormous value to you, outside of its role as cover traffic.
The idea of downloading the Wikipedia archives is pretty good since it doesn't note the content you were looking for. Another idea is to use search engines that protect your privacy such as ixquick or duckduckgo (they store search queries but they don't track individuals (I.e they don't store your IP Address, as far as we know that is).

Preferably someone from Tor can answer this: Why can't Tor use a funding model similar to Wikipedia?  For better or for worse Tor is currently synonymous with online anonymity (or the best semblance of it available), in the same way Wikipedia is synonymous with online encyclopedia.
If you just stood up and said, "Help us get out of this Faustian bargain," the people and organizations that rely on your software would certainly help find a way to raise the money needed to support your work.  Especially after reading a chat log that shows how aggressive and twisted the attacks againstyour work are.

This was an informative video, especially wrt unikernels.? Certainly this Haskell implementation can be a useful research tool.
However, the author strongly implies that it would/could be a "good thing" having this other implementation running in the wild, side by side with the current implementation.? But doesn't research suggest multiple implementations tend to widen the attack surface.
Unfortunately I don't have access to academic research.? Does anybody have relevant citations?? I only have a reference to a video of Patterson/Sassaman talking about it wrt langsec:
And here's the relevant snippet:
Meredith: ...another boundary that tends to be ripe for problems is when you have multiple implementations of the same protocol.? This was what we had a lot of fun with last year between nss, cryptoapi and openssl.
Len: Because you wind up with a situation where they're not all speaking the same protocol.? They're all speaking versions of the same protocol in-- in most cases-- mutually intelligible dialects.? However, if you can wind up with situations where one implementation of the same protocol parses the same input data in a different way than a second implementation of this same protocol parsing this same input data, you now have-- first of all-- proved that they're not identical-- and secondly you've got a point of weakness.? We refer to this as "differential parse string attacks."? We'll have a slide on that later, but this allows you to pinpoint the area where there's likely to be some manoeuvrability to build an attack.? This is where your attack vector is likely to be because you can confuse the recipient by crafting an expression of some sort of payload for this packet so it means one thing that's safe to the one implementation.
In x509 we had the problem of-- as we mentioned before-- openssl pretty much doing things correctly: parsing things as they were-- we've got string literals here, we've got this null character-- obviously that's a character and we're going to treat it as such and validate against everything after it. We were not going to ignore it.? The problem, though, was we got special rights based on that-- the signing of our csr.? And then we turned around and had a different implementation parse those same parts.? They parsed them differently, and differently in such a way that it escalated privilege for us.
So had openssl been doing things as identically but as haphazardly as the browsers, the attacks probably would not have been possible. Or, most of them.
Meredith: It's a little bit unexpected, but if everybody's doing something wrong the same way, then it's actually not as bad.? if one person is doing things right and everybody else is doing things wrong, then you actually end up playing them off each other.
