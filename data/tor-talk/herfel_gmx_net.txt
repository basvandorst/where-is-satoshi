@_subject: My ISP block Tor Servers 
IIRC there was a discussion about this a while back on the list, and as of yet there are no easily accessible end-user ways of working around this. (Please correct me if am wrong) I think what you are doing is pretty much what was suggested:
btw: Unless I am mistaken Mr.Death is writing us from the Emirates (at least that's what his E-Mail headers are saying), not from the US, so talking about the legal details in the US is not only offtopic, it's also useless. But go ahead, I am sure the UAE will be impressed when you tell them what you think and they'll stop filtering. Not.

@_subject: transparent forced dns-'proxy' on Exit-Node - is it ok? 
Where did you get that quote from? I don't think I wrote that, I certainly didn't mean that. Sorry for the confusion if my question was unclear.
This is about a Tor-Server that's currently running with reject */*. I could accept port 53 (dns), but only if it was ok to force-redirect everything to my own dns-server. (Or simplified: I do not want people to send arbritrary tcp-traffic out of my port 53; but I would be ok with answering regular old DNS-queries.) For the large majority of users that wouldn't be a problem. However certain people might be annoyed or [theoretically] harmed if they are doing very specific things (see my original post), when they think they are talking to a specific DNS server but actually are not. Or in case they want to use port 53 for something else.
So I am interested if there is a certain "ethical" policy to follow when running a tor-node that says "never touch traffic, even if it's with good intent" or "never say you accept exit-traffic on a port, unless you are willing to pass through all traffic on that port without modification". And if there is no such policy/ethical-code, I'd be interested in hearing opinions whether such behaviour would be considered good or bad.
I haven't tried that specific script, but I am using a similar setup with openvpn elsewhere. It's certainly doable and not terribly complex.
I don't which specific kinds of problems you refer to, but technically there are no hurdles to what I want to do. If in fact there is bottleneck in exit-nodes that handle dns-resolution, then my approach may be interesting to other middleman nodes that have local dns-servers, or dns-caches and help increase that number. But like I said, I have no idea if that is actually a real problem. (And the above question remains whether it would be considered ok).

@_subject: irssi+tsocks: can't connect to ssl-secured irc-server 
I am trying to use irssi with tsocks to tunnel my irc-traffic over tor. tsocks is configured correctly and tunneling plain-text irc works ok. I can also tunnel other instant-messengers via tsocks (ssl-secured connections, too) and it works ok (checked with lsof to see the conections).
However when I am trying to use irssi with ssl-secured irc-server, irssi will just sit there trying to connect and cpu goes to 100%. Can anyone confirm this problem?
To reproduce: $ tsocks irssi
(without -ssl there are no problems. Also without tsocks there are no problems.)
I didn't see anything mentioned in the documentation on this. So I wanted to hear from a few more people whether they can confirm this problem. How would one go about finding the source of the problem? Isn't tsocks totally transparent to the application? I thought so, especially since many other applications (even those using ssl) do not seem to have any problems.

@_subject: transparent forced dns-'proxy' on Exit-Node - is it ok? 
for reasons that are not relevant to the question, my tor-node 'cannot' function as an exit-node. However I was thinking that it would be possible for me, to use iptables to force-route all outgoing dns-requests from the tor-IP to my local dns-server, who would then make outgoing queries to it's upstream dns-servers etc. Since we have a fast server and plenty of bandwidth and reliable DNS (that do not much around with things), I think this ould be helpful (in a small way) for improving DNS-resolution on the tor-network. However I can see how some people could see this as a negative thing, because in cases where tor-users wanted to specifically talk with certain DNS-Servers, or wanted to use non-dns udp-traffic on port 53, which for some reason happened to look very much like dns-traffic, well, those people would be annoyed, because they'd keep getting potentially "wrong" answers, possibly in a way that they wouldn't be aware of right away.
Is there a policy on this? If not, I'd be interested in hearing opinions (with arguments) about whether you'd find this helpful or hurtful; or whether I should just forget about the idea.
Thanks and Regards

You haven't specififed the threat(s) you are trying to protect against. You should never try to build a solution without a clear description of the problem.
To prevent other people from tampering with data on a remote connection there is ssl. To prevent MITM Attacks there is ssl. If you do not trust the server, and want to be sure that a document is from a certain person, there is GPG, S/Mime etc.
It looks like you might be trying to reinvent the wheel, when you talk about defining a standard...
However integrating the possibilities of gpg into browsers would be a nice thing, but given that this thread started on the topic of injecting (mailicious) code into webpages, that's probably n entirely different threat model you have in mind.
And of course, let's not kid ourselves - the majority of users are overwhelmed/uninformed about how to make proper use of ssl (What are CAs? How do I verify a certificates? How to react to what kind of warnings?), so it's unlikely that something more complex that works on a document basis, or fragments of documents is going to be more successful in actually reaching its goals (i.e. appropiate use rather than just wide adoption with uninformed/dangerous use).

@_subject: Talks of hidden services and DNS 
It is explained here:
The reason for using cryptic fingerprints instead of human-readable names is described in [WWW] Zooko's Distnames: they are self-authenticating. If a client wants to connect to a hidden service he asks the directory services for the .onion name's service descriptor which includes its public key. If the hash of the public key matches the .onion name, the client can be sure it will encrypt data for the right hidden service.
"Zooko's Triangle" which is discussed in Stiegler's [WWW] Petname Systems argues that names cannot be global, secure, and memorable at the same time. This means while being unique and secure, .onion names have the disadvantage that they cannot be not meaningful to humans.  A naming system introduces costs and reduces benefits gained from the current system - and it doesn't offer much in return. I could rehash all the old argument, but it's already explained so well in the links above...
And yeah, a naming-schema/translator existed at one point (and there's nothing to stop anybody from offering such a system), but IIRC it was not exactly wildly popular.

@_subject: how much traffic does an unthrottled middleman draw on 100 MBit/s? 
Hello Eugen,
If you do not want to have constant use of 100MB/s you should use the Bandwidth throttle. I don't really see the point in leaving it out if you wish it was restricted anyway.
But as others have said, you _never_ get reliable 100MB/s with any of the affordable Servers anywhere - especially not, if they have large bandwidth allowances or worse "unlimited" offers. This is not even considering any Tor-related issues. For most consumer-level servers you'll get effectively anywhere from 5-30 MBit/s depending on the time of day and the route etc.
Check  with the filter (at the bottom)  "contains" 88.198. or any other of Hetzner's netblocks (there's 24 tor nodes on that /16 subnet).
I would also advise you to go read in their forums. Officials have stated that above 1 TB per month you either pay x cent per GB (you'll have to let them know well inadvance though), or by default they will throttle you to a 10MBit/s (half-duplex) connection until you show them that it was either a configuration error, or a hacker, and that you took steps to prevent that from happening again. They also mentioned that they keep a closer eye on servers that constantly use more than 0,3 MByte/s or 0,3 MBit/s (can't remember...).
I can't give you references since I don't have access to their forums anymore (customers only), but most of the statements were from within the last 6 months, if you want to search for them there.
So given that, you should either let them know you'll pay for Traffic above 1TB, or you should use Bandwidthlimits to make sure you stay well below that.
