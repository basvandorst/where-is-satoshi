I am very curious how a vendor is detecting Tor Project traffic.
My questions is what are they seeing to alert upon?  I have asked them,
but I was told "that is in the special sauce."
Is the connection from the users computer to the bridge encrypted?
Thank you for your insight.

Unfortunately, I cannot see their signature set.  They have it locked
down.  They claim they are not detecting it by IP address.
