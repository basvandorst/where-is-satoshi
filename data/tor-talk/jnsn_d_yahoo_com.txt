Thanks Nick,
But are you sure this doesn't need some testing or updating??
When was the last time you followed it?
Check out Roger's earlier message on this thread.  The build process
we use is documented at:

Hi Tormeisters,
How does orconfig.h get generated on windows when building from scratch?

Thanks Roger, I get it now.
One more question if you don't mind - where do you get your unistd.h from? (included from eventdns.c) My windows box appears not to have it.
Once upon a time, the answer was "manually" -- you can still see one in
 which I presume is useful for
MSVC++ builds or the like.
If you're using mingw, look at
 for
instructions that appear to run ./configure, and therefore probably auto
generate an orconfig.h file.
Hope that helps,

But eventdns.c doesn't have a  HAVE_UNISTD_H in it.
unistd.h is only included when HAVE_UNISTD_H is set; if your platform
doesn't have it, the configure script should not define HAVE_UNISTD_H.

Are there any instructions on the complete build process (from source) for windows?
