@_subject: Eventdns: All name servers have failed 
After several hours of searching thru the archives, googling, etc;
trying to find answers for what is causing this error and what to do
about it.
I could find a lot of bug tickets, and a lot of issues about it, but
didn't seem to locate a fix for it except there were several for the
Linux OS.
I did not find anything on the Windows Svr side of the problem. I had
this issues with Win Xp, but did not have it with Win 7. Now I am
having it with WIn Svr 2008.
Was there a fix or a solution for it, or was it determined that it was
not important enough to worry about at the time, since generally it
would correct it self with in less than a second most of the time and
continue to work till it happened again?
I have had 5 of these warnings now in 12 hrs today. To me that seems
kind of excessive, but maybe its just me.
The last 2 warnings were exactly 1 hour apart. But as I mentioned
earlier, it lasts for last than a second.
Any ideas or solutions?
Thanks for the help and assistance.

This has just started in the past 3 days. I first had a network drop
signal. Called the ip provider and they came out a did a signal test
and found it was low and fixed that.
However it did not fix my problem. Vidalia has been freezing up
several times in the past 4 days. With it progressively getting worse.
I have had to reboot the computer 2 times so far today and reboot
vidalia 4 times today.
In checking the logs, am not able to find any reason for it to
lock/freeze up. Naturally it has been frustration since it keeps me
from staying online. On the tor logs, there is a number of eventdns
issues, but that is not unusual as it corrects it self generally with
in less than a couple of seconds.
I have run out of ideas. Any ideas on what to look for?
I did notice that my inbound and outbound connections have increased a
lot and am not sure if that may be the issue causing the freeze.
I am on Win Svr 2008rc.  Also running Tor ver. 0.2.1.25  and Vidalia
ver 0.2.7 . Not sure what else info one might need.
Any ideas on what to do next?

And that is providing your ISP even lets you get to 3 strikes. From my
phone experience. tho it was not a letter DMCA and probably just a
scare tactic, but was told if I didn't resolve the problem of the
server being used for copyright infringements, etc, my account would
be terminated.
Even with the explanation, they didn't care cause of the complaints.
However, I said I would take care of the problem if you give me the
ports this was allegedly happening on. I then just blocked them and
have had no issues since then. By doing this, I still have a full exit
server running, and didnt lose the account and the ISP was happy.
Personally I don't trust the 3 strikes your out syndrome. Unless its
in the contract, I believe most ISP's can cancel the contract if they
believe their subscriber does not seem to want to take care of the
problem and the ISP has the paper work with the allegations, etc. But
I am not a lawyer.

@_subject: My relay never shows up 
How many days is your relay up and running with out going down and/or
having to reboot? I have found that if one keeps rebooting or the
relay keeps going down, it takes a while for it to be recognized.
Also I have seen where it may take several minutes for the network
status to populate before a relay shows up. The biggest issue I
personally have seen is if one can't stay on line for any length of
time, the relay probably will not show up.
I am sure there may be other reasons, but this has been my observation .

As with Mike Perry's post, I would also suggests to run a middle node
instead of an exit node and see what happens. I suspect you probably
won't have any more issues and should resolve QWest problems.
I also when I was called about the ' illegal ' stuff going thru my
computer, I just asked the ISP what port it was and then blocked the
port. Some users have found ways to use other ports that are different
than what we would block for exits. To get around that I just blocked
those ports. No more problems.
I have not had any complaints on DMCA for over a year now. ( fingers crossed ).

@_subject: Need for sane ISP's? 
I do not know if this will help or not. After I got my server up and
running, approx 10 days later i got a call from my IP
provider that they had received several complaints about illegal
downloading of copyright material. Shocked the hell out of me. I
figured if it was going to happen, it would happen later than sooner.
I did not receive a DMCA per say, but I was told that they had 7
notices and the issues needed to be take care of.
I explained what I was doing, but they, at least from tier 2 I think,
had no clue about TOR nodes. So Instead of
trying to act like an expert and they didn't know what was going on, I
asked about what ports this was happening
on and they told me and they slipped as to who the complainant was. I
told them I would take care of the problem and to let me know if any
more complaints came in.
So far as of this writing, I have received no more complaints. I had
to uncheck the Misc box in the exit node, which would cover the ports
complaint was on. Now if this would happen again, They may get a
little stronger action or force full about it. I will have to verify
this, but I believe according to the TOS of the provider, If I did not
comply and attempt to correct the problem , they would pull my
contract. I have not at this time sent a letter to them using the
Like I said earlier, the problem has been resolved as far as I know at

I don't know if this will help or not, but in the states, my ISP
provider calls me when they get a complaint. They tell me what the
complaint was about, I get the ports the issues came thru and what
they were. All except the last one were Torrents. The last one was
allegedly email spamming.
I started to explain, but realized that they would just turn off my
service for not correcting the problem. In my case the EFF legal
notice didn't work as they didn't care about it. Their main concern
wee the complaints recieved from my ip addy. ( It could also just be
their way of intimidation ).
What I did on the Torrents was to turn off the ' misc services exit '
( tho I would have liked to keep it running there and may try again
and see how many if any complants come thru with the ports blocked )
and block the specific ports that were reported. On the email, I just
blocked the specific port. That so far has taken care of those issues.
( fingers crossed )
I have yet to receive an actual abuse notice in the mail or via email.
Like I said not sure if this will help in your case, but it has worked
for me.

@_subject: New Tor Relay: Help!!!!! 
In my past experience with setting up several relays, both exit and
non exit, it takes awhile, especially with a new relay for it to be
recognized by the other servers on the list. You should notice an
increase gradually in several days, providing you have everything set
up properly.
One thing I have noticed in the past is making sure the firewall is
set up so TOR can be accessed.  That will cause you a slow down. Being
that you are a former TOR server, I would just wait it out and give it
several days for the others to know your out there and will get used
to accessing you.
I am a little concerned tho about the DNS hijackings, which is not
good. This may or may not also be interfering with the server working
properly. Might consider looking at changing to a different DNS server
or changing IP providers.  With that being said, maybe someone with
more experience can give you some ideas on how to go about and
correcting the possible DNS issues.
Welcome back as a TOR relay.

about only 80+ relay differences.

non exit relay is showing the higher number of relays.

@_subject: Full bandwidth is not used. 
Paul, I am not savy enough to explain on the ins and outs of tor, etc.
But what I can tell you, with both my servers running, I have yet
reached my full bandwidth. I read someplace when I was researching on
routers, that some routers actually had reduced the amt of bandwidth
going thru them. ie: person was paying for 10 mbps and was only
getting ( showing ) less than 5mps after going thru the router.
I suspect that if your full bandwidth was being used, your system
would possibly freeze cause of a burst of speed, etc., there would be
no more room for more bandwidth. IMO, i don't think one would really
want to be using it to the max. ex: you buy a car and want to see how
it runs, so you take it out on the road and open it up as fast as it
will go. To get the full usage out of the car, one would have to run
it wide open, which of course could cause problems and would be hard
on the car if done for any length of time.
Also in another message, it was brought up that if a server is turned
on and off a number of times and often, the user count of users using
your bandwidth would be down until it became stable again. Time wise ,
if I remember right, is a 24-48 hour period.

I can not speak for everyone else, but for my self, if I read this
right, imo, there is no difference or very little difference between
nagware popups and splash screens that have reminders or ads on them.
There is enough ' crap '  ware out there with those pop ups, etc. As a
relay operator, if i had to see this everytime an upgrade was done or
had to reboot for whatever reason, those screens/popups would be
enough after a while to stop being a relay.
I am not in the ' technically-minded ' user base, but I am among the
relay user database that donates time, bandwidth, money to the cause
here. As just like several hundred others.
Again, imo, I get the feeling beginning from the topic, that it
appears to be more to this then meets the eye. It seems to me that
some one other than TOR is going to benefit more from this.
I may be wrong in the way I am reading this, but sure seems like to me
that this is an entrepreneur proposition for some one to make money

That is normal right after you start Tor up. What your seeing is Tor
is still building circuits. After a short period, it does level out,
then you should only be showing several circuits. Your dl/up speeds
will vary during this and will level off shortly after.
After your connection has been up for a while ie: several days, your
speeds will pick up as the other nodes get to know your node.
Everything is normal of what your seeing.  :)

I had added the ' SafeLogging 0 ' to the file as per Tor-ops
message/reply. Twenty four hours later when I saw that it had not
removed the ' scrubbed ' and replaced it with the node/address, I
checked the file again and it was not in the file where I put it.
I just checked it now, It is still in the file, but the logs still
show the ' scubbed' and not the address as supposedly the '
SafeLogging 0 ' was to replace. Time wise it appears to be at a
minimum of once an hour. Which makes me believe it is the same address
that is being scrubbed.

a ' geoips vidalia ' address ( am not showing complete addy ).
Apparently for some reason it is not resolving or connecting to

I am going to have to agree with Sebastian here. I think that there

probably are not running in the high end as some of those relays that
are able to have company or some other type of backing. But they are
relays just the same and are part of the Tor network and are depended
on just like any of the others.
To pay out of ones pocket for the bandwidth for a dedicated Tor relay
is not cheap. So kudo's to those that are able to run their dedicated

enough, if it were not for the  individual relays from home, I don't

With the latest TOR version and the increased in nodes, with the new

that the volume load would have been decrease from what it was on some
of the nodes?
Maybe a better explanation I am trying to ask is before the updated
version, the amt of band usage was a lot higher than it is now. I
suspect with the more nodes we have n ow that might explain some of us
not being used like we were, but does the new balancing be making that
adjustment also by distributing the users thru out the nodes better?.
Hopefully that explains it better what I am trying to ask.

Yes, they will disconnect your service if it is against their TOS.
IMO: For a lot of people, $12.00 is a lot of money, especially
students. But if you look at this way, you are donating bandwidth and
your server to TOR and I believe if $12.00 is all you need to pay

I do believe some one sounds very paranoid. If you feel that way, you have

Running a exit node on DSL or Cable from home, is just as safe, I believe,
as running it through a provider from another country. There are options
one can use if they do not want to run a full exit relay node. As they can
run a middle node which cuts down the probability of legal issues arising.
