I like the double entendre: FreeBSD > Linux :)
Accurate and funny. Nice work.

Really surprising to see such hypocrisy in these circles.
I really didn't get the "rape" vibe from the graphic at all. Like you alluded to earlier, you see what you want to see.

No. I can't remember reading anything you wrote, let alone disagreeing with it.
I do agree with this.

Sure. I shared my favoured interpretation earlier.
Beyond that, I see Jefferson fucking Obama from behind (i.e. bucking of ignominious attempts to erode our hard-earned constitutional convention). It is very well done too. Picture perfect!

Indeed. The irony only adds to its appeal.
Tor empowers citizens to royally fuck Orwellian tactical planning, such as that which is implemented by the NSA.
The iconography and allegorical-themed narrative is rather accurate. The piece.. like a digital Rembrandt. Really :)
But, I do agree with your summary of the NSA and Tor's prophylactic utility.

There is no need. It has been read many times.
Not sure how your suggestion diminishes Tor's utility in circumventing Orwellian policies. Tor is an integral munition in the Constitution-defending arsenal; which would be much weaker without it.

No doubt :)
My statement was in reference to the original topic of the graphic and its (perceived) intended meaning.

I took another run at this and managed to get a bridge running under the free usage tier.
It works fine, but I have an Amazon problem (that some here may know how to solve).
I am trying to setup a Billing Alert[1] to notify me when I exceed my free usage limit. However, despite setting up the instance >12 hours ago and enabling Billing Alerts in account preferences, I am still receiving the following message in the Alarms panel {
No billing metrics found. If you recently enabled billing metrics, it may take up to 6 hours for them to appear here. If they do not appear please visit the Billing Console, you may need to adjust your preferences to receive billing alerts.
I recall a discussion not too long ago where the suggestion of Billing Alerts was made to avoid incurring unexpected fees at the end of the month. I was hoping someone knows what I need to do to activate this. [1]

Thanks, Katya. It has been sorted. I contacted Amazon, it was a delay on their end in activating the billing metric.

Thanks for reporting. This happens when directory authorities switch
signing keys and you shouldn't worry.
My guess is that your fingerprints read
which would be gabelmoo with a new signing key since 2014-01-11 16:26:31
It's actually a bit misleading that you replaced both fingerprints with
the same string. If they are indeed identical, there's something to
worry about.
You will see more of these in the near future as all directory
authorities are switching signing keys before schedule in order to
increase the key size. See
 for the progress on
this. We hope to have moved all authority signing keys to 2048 bits
within a couple of weeks.
