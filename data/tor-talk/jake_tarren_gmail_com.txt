A Survey on the Security of Virtual Machines
Info on browsers - based on Whonix
Running Tor in a vm isn't totally secure, as some software can escape the vm into the host os, but that's more in-depth than most, if not all, newbies need.
Honestly, the most direct route is to throw tails/whonix on a jump drive(rather a write protected DVD or an sd card with the write protection switch enabled). Boot up, and run Tor with no java/flash, and https everywhere, as configured by default in TBB.

This is interesting, it seems a lot of people don't really grasp the core concepts of Tor.  Someone should make a introductory video we can refer people too.  It should have an explanation of proxies, and how Tor is vulnerable to "big brother" attacks.
Would anyone be interested in doing this?

This is the wrong mailing list for you.
Go somewhere else.

I don't thin this is the right place for that...
Maybe try contacting her through one of her friends?
