Do you know when you will update your package (if you intended to do
it) ? ;-)
Thanks you very much for this tor package,

Do you have any sample of such testing page ? showmyip.com permit to see
problem with javascript. Perhaps another one with more plugins exposure
(flash, etc.) could be useful ?
Are people working on it ?

CircuitBuildTimeout NUM
        Try for at most NUM seconds when building circuits. If the
        circuit isn't open in that time, give up on it. (Default: 1
        minute.)
LongLivedPorts PORTS
        A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running
        connections (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for
        streams that use these ports will contain only high-uptime
        nodes, to reduce the chance that a node will go down before the
        stream is finished. (Default: 21, 22, 706, 1863, 5050, 5190,
        5222, 5223, 6667, 8300, 8888)
