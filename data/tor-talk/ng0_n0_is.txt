Not to derail from debian, but you might want to look at tor-ramdisk[0]
thought this might require building it yourself[1], last time I tried there
were problems with the pre-built images blueness put on the download location.
I tried to address this to blueness in irc, but they seem to be busy with
other things at the moment.

Assume that any information can be used against you, as laws have been
changed to what LEA want to work on, so what is harmless now can be
very dangerous in n years.
I don't fully follow that myself, but it's a possibility to consider.
Well actually not that hard.
For bridging the gap until there's something better, there's
bitmessage now, which can either be used through PyBitmessage
or bitmessage-daemon + bitmessage-client or other applications.
If anything positive to mention about it, its network is distributed
unlike the federation of email servers.
I once recommended A/I, runbox, and others for a good number of
years but I have seen the assumptions people make when they
switch to them ("now all my communication is safer than the
one I use on my gmx account and encrypted by default" - yep,
this really happens..) and the problems which occur with
providers where you have to put your trust in them.
I still have to see the transparency report I talked about
with someone from/connected to A/I 3 years ago when they
were working on it.
And you have to trust that they know what's best for their
systems. They have this Orangenbook out, but it is outdated
as the way they operate changed a bit.

Read this thread to find out why this might NOT be something you want to get into,
this is creating an equal situation in my opinion.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ProtonMail 
Keep in mind that ProtonMail is still in beta phase.
They fixed some problems, but they did not address all of my bug reports
so far, which might make it unpleasant to use for people who deal with
expect people to get angry at you because their
webinterface reply only knows 1 layer of comment block and you can't
even break this block.
This alone + forced html format and no way to hook into with an external
application are big minus for people who care about email as just text,
in my opinion.

There are other problems, but it's been too long since I reported them.
Some have been fixed, some don't. Occasionally I check protonmail to see
if something has changed, but I don't have time for that at the moment.
I can't recommend alternatives as I consider Email something which is
long overdue for replacement.
I'd say, register and see what the bugs are like.
For me it is too much of an annoyance to use.

You could get in touch with support to ask about the tor part of the question.

I have been using A/I for almost 10 years now, but when I wanted to recommend it
to someone who previously had no email account it did not work as they require
an existing email account for verification. There might've been also some
Javascript involved and although they have a .onion address for www,smtp,pop,imap
and other protocols, you can not register through this .onion
This year they changed to lets encrypt and faded out their own CA, so you
have to trust LE as well.
