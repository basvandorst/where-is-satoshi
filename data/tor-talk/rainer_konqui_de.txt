@_subject: DNS prob? 
I got a lot of entries in my logfile like this:
Nov 11 20:39:03.291 [warn] spawn_enough_dnsworkers(): 100 DNS workers
are spawned; all are busy. Killing one.
Nov 11 20:39:03.292 [warn] dns_cancel_pending_resolve(): Bug: Address
[scrubbed] is pending but has no pending connections!
someone know what the problem here is?
