@_subject: Tor on Nokia Internet Tablet? 
I've about ~768kbit/s upstream and an un-used Nokia770 internet
tablet, with an ARM9 clocked at 250mhz.
Do you think it would make sence running a TOR relay on it, and do you
think the ARM would be able to keep up even with this low bandwith.
Some performance tests suggested its about as fast as a Pentium-90.
Thank you in advance, lg Clemens

Good to know that ARM binaries are planned, maybe I'll setup the
toolchain up and try it myself too.
Btw. do I need a public IP adress to run a relay?
Thanks a lot, lg Clemens

@_subject: Relay running only 9h/day? 
1.) I have a 768kbit uplink with a server I plan to run a tor relay on.
However that server is only up 9h/day and I read short running relays
harm the network - would it still make sence to run a relay on it?
2.) Is there any way to shut down a relay properly, so all current
connections can be safely migrated to other nodes?
3.) Any experiences how much traffic a Pentium-90 can handle? Assuming
a mips-400mhz can do 250kb, I guess the P90 should be able to saturate
the 96kb uplink?
Thanks, Clemens

@_subject: Howto build static linux binary? 
I would like to build a statically linked binary of tor.
Is there an easy way to accomplish this, e.g. by passing a simply
command line option to configure?
Thank you in advance, Clemens

Hi Sebastian
Hmm, I would prefer to have all libraries statically linked (including
libc) - so that the resulting executable would have no external
dependencies (except for the kernel-syscall interface of course ^^).
Sad this isn't possible ... maybe I can find a way to do this manually.
Thanks, Clemens

@_subject: [tor-talk] Police was here - whats next? 
Today police was here and took all my cohabitant's computer hardware &
software with them, while I was alone at home.
Until a few minutes ago I didn't even know what happend, now he told
me he is accused of loggin into a <....> porn site.
I ran a tor exit node at that time, and I am confident somebody
mis-used our tor exit node,
as our WLAN is WPA2 encrypted.
Are there lists or logs available, which exit nodes were running on which IPs?
I am interested in a small period in March 2010.
Thank you in advance, Clemens

Hi Mike,
On that particular day, my reley is listed active with high probability.
That should at least help a bit to back my claim.
Thanks again, Clemens

@_subject: [tor-talk] After "Opening OR listener on 0.0.0.0:9001" nothing 
I would like to use my Nokia-770 as tor relay.
I've configured port forarding on my router for port 9001 (it is

I used the same configuration for another relay, so I think it is fine.
Any ideas how to diagnose it further?
Thank you in advance, Clemens
