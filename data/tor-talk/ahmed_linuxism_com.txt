@_subject: [tor-talk] Let's make Onion Addresses Meaningful To Humans 
Hello Folks,
I have a cool idea to make onion addresses memorable. That will have no
effect on its authenticity and security.
First, I need to define some terms I will use in this email.
?*_{e}: is any English (or any other language) word.
D*: is a set of all English words (or any other language again) in
D*_{N}: N means the location of element ?* in D*.
For example, if D* = { 'cat', 'hat' ,'rat' }.
D*_{0} returns 'cat', and D*_{'cat'} returns 0
max(D*): is a total number of words in a dictionary D*.
I hope you didn't get confused at this point.
Onion address needs to be converted to decimal instead of base 32 to
make it easier to implement.
Let's say I have already have a value of onion address converted to a
decimal. That number is 2025107508922. I will take that number and convert it to number in base max(D*).
If we have 51236 words in English dictionary, the result of that
conversion will be only 3 digits numbers. The numbers after conversion
are the following: Here is a wolframalpha conversion link
+51236 I used dash "-" instead of colons ":" to separate the converted digits.
It's easier to make it work with the URL (URL uses colon to separate
address from port) , and easier to convert to the original value.
We will take 711, 22133 and 48918 and return the ?*_{e} from D*. Where
?*_{e} is an English word, and D* is a dictionary.
So, D*_{771}: returns ?*_{e}', and D*_{22133}: returns different
?*_{e}'' and so on. At the end we will have something like that:
?*_{e}'  -  ?*_{e}''  -  ?*_{e}^(3).onion
If ?*_{e}' is equal to 'cat',  ?*_{e}'' ( '' means another word) is
equal to 'rat' and  ?*_{e}^(3) is equal to 'hat'. The final result will
be something like this
To convert back again to the original SHA hash value, all we have to do
is to return a number from D*_{?*_{e}} for each word, and convert it
back again to the original base.
Users will not have an option to explicitly choose onion domain name,
but they will have an option to generate a lot of keys, and choose
something they like.

The according to the onion wiki, the length of the onion address is 80
The largest number the onion address can get is:
1208925819614629174706175 That's because FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF is the largest number
(unsigned) in hex for 80 bits key length.
If we assume we have a dictionary that has 50K words, the maximum number
of words in the onion address will be 6 words.
Wolframa link:
For a 100K words dictionary, it will be 5 words
+to+base+100000 The average length of a word in English dictionary is 5.1 characters
according to this +word+length The larger number of words in a dictionary we use, the shorter the
address we get.
The end result will be something like this:
xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx.onion

and store that file where?
How that encrypted file will be updated?

OK, here are some real examples I got from a dictionary that has a 67843
words. I collected most of the words from the Bible and Gutenberg
I used Python to convert to decimal from base 32.
3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion = cowboys-slipt-pisanio-utgar-spinnt.onion Official Tor package archive
j6im4v42ur6dpic3.onion = merton-arkader-eozon-yea-russky.onion The last part means literally "I'm Russian" in Russian
 Hit listen in Russian
Official Tor media archive
 = puzzler-longis-fido-jipal-vilda.onion The size of the dictionary is 455K uncompressed, and 163K compressed by
Gzip. Hmm, What do you think?
Should I post this to tor-dev?

Not really. Users can synchronize their data with their friends when
they become online, and their friends can pass it to the offline user's
friends when they become online.

One question is still remain unanswered. How did they locate Silkroad
server before locating him?
They had full image of the server before his arrest.
