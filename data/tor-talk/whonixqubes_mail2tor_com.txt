@_subject: [tor-talk] New Announcement: Qubes + Whonix is now available! 
For those interested in Tor, Security, Qubes, Whonix, etc...
With the help of several kind people in the Whonix & Qubes communities, I
have successfully integrated the Qubes + Whonix operating systems
For those who would prefer Whonix as an alternative to TorVM in Qubes (for
torifying your VM traffic), this option is now available to you.
This initial Qubes + Whonix configuration is achived using current versions:
 - Qubes R2rc2 & Whonix 8.2
Qubes + Whonix currently exists as a customized dual HVM configuration:
 - Whonix-Gateway HVM + Whonix-Workstation HVM
A simple networking setup for Qubes + Whonix would look like:
 - NetVM <- FirewallVM <- Whonix-Gateway <- Whonix-Workstation
Where, for example, the Whonix-Gateway conceptually replaces TorVM as your
Tor ProxyVM, and Whonix-Workstation conceptually replaces your standard
AppVMs (AnonVMs).
You can get the Qubes + Whonix step-by-step instructions and more info here:
All suggestions and feedback are welcome!
I look forward to helping make Qubes + Whonix integration even tighter and
more seamless throughout the future.
If you're interested in the future growth of the Qubes + Whonix platform,
then please join in with us to actively further this goal.
For example, when ProxyVM support is added to the Qubes Debian Template,
we can take Qubes + Whonix beyond the current HVM limitation and utilize a
naitive ProxyVM + AppVM setup for Whonix.
Thank you again to everyone who helped me bring the first known successful
Qubes + Whonix configuration to the world...
Patrick, Joanna, Marek, Jason, Axon, cprise, and everyone else who has
helped! Thank you! :)
P.S. Qubes + Whonix 9 support is coming soon!

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Annoucement: Qubes + Whonix 9 and more! 
Since my original release of Qubes + Whonix back in late August 2014, some
interesting developments have happened that I'm excited to share with
Qubes + Whonix Primary Sources:
The primary sources of Qubes + Whonix information are located at:
- User Documentation:  whonix.org/wiki/Qubes
- Dedicated Forum:  whonix.org/forum/Qubes
Qubes + Whonix Summary:
First a summary of what Qubes + Whonix is about...
The Whonix OS (whonix.org), based on Debian, like Tails or TorVM, torifies
all of your internet traffic at an OS level, preventing remote leaks of
unique identifiers, such as your IP address, MAC address, hardware
serials, etc, designed with hardcore anonymous threat models in mind.
The Qubes OS (qubes-os.org) is a security focused, user friendly
virtualization platform, based on Xen, which offers hardcore isolation of
your system level resources and VM desktops, even helping to prevent
serious endpoint attacks, such as kernel compromises, BadUSB, Evil Maid,
Qubes + Whonix is the beautiful marriage of these two hardcore security
and anonymity focused platforms, for the aim of integrating the best in
endpoint security and internet torification. Qubes + Whonix runs as dual
VMs, inside of Qubes, isolating the Whonix-Workstation (user desktop
applications) and the Whonix-Gateway (Tor networking proxy), all within
one single host machine.
Inside Host: Whonix-Workstation --> Whonix-Gateway --> Torified Internet
You can even establish multiple Whonix-Workstations and Whonix-Gateways
for multiple independent and isolated Tor identity environments.
Qubes + Whonix News:
Now on to the news...
Whonix 9 was recently released which brought several system level
improvements over the prior Whonix 8.2, and helped us further streamline
our Qubes + Whonix implementation.
Qubes + Whonix 9 is now supported and available with step-by-step install
guides here:
New Whonix Qubes Forum:
Joanna Rutkowska (Qubes founder) has much appreciated our Qubes + Whonix
As recently annouced with their Qubes R2 final release, the Qubes team is
now officially working with an esteemed board member of the Tor Project,
privacy expert, Mr. Caspar Bowden, to further the adoption and
optimization of Qubes as a strong platform for privacy services and
And, along these same lines, Joanna has expressed interest to me for
wanting to integrate Whonix and TorVM as super simple clickable user
experiences, pre-installed and pre-configured, into the official Qubes OS
distro, for easy OS level torification.
Our above mentioned ProxyVM + AppVM development work with nrgaway will
likely be a big leap forward in further realizing this vision of Joanna's
for official integration of Whonix into the official Qubes user friendly
GUI installer.
So there you have it...
- Qubes + Whonix 9 is now available.
- A new step-by-step source code install guide, along with binay images.
- A new dedicated community forum for the Qubes + Whonix platform.
- A new paradigm of ProxyVM + AppVM architecture is being developed.
- Hardcore Whonix torification may be coming to a Qubes installer near you.
Very exciting times for Qubes + Whonix as a super secure Tor platform!
Join us! :)
