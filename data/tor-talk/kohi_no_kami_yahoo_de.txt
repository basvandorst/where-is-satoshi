Hey guys,
first of all. Thank you very very much for the Tor-Project!!! I love
you guys!
To the topic:
A friend of mine and me were fooling around what would be, if there
were a possibility to realize a kind of social network but safe
without any data abuse. Might you give me a short explanation if it
were possible and how the TOR-Project could be a big link to handle
that? Sure, it was a "what if", but we are seriously interested in
this to know.
Thank you in advance,
