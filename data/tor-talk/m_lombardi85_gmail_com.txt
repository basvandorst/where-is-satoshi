@_subject: setting up a TOR relay 
I have a little stupid question:
In the near future i will buy a little MIPS-based board running Linux
and i would like to set up a TOR relay with it.
The problem is that i have an extremely limited amount of RAM ( 64 Mb
) and i read
that a tor relay generally needs 768 Mb for a 10 Mbit connection.
Considering the fact that my bandwidth is limited to 30 Kb/s (240 Kbps)
can it works with just 64 Mb of RAM? (Maybe limiting the number of connections?)
What about 128 Mb of RAM?
Thanks for the help.
