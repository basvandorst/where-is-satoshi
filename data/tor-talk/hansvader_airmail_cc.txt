Dear TOR people,
I have a question regarding the updating mechanism of tor browser from within the browser.
These updates are signed I stronly suppose. I would like to know, does checking these signatures depend on external programs like gpg? Is the signature verification application for updates part of the browser bundle itself?
Thank you
Mr V.

You can use network.trr.mode to enforce the use of DoT. IIRC 3 is to enforce it and not using other DNS. When using network.trr.mode Firefox should not do any other DNS than DoH. This should adress your concerns.
The best way is to use DoT and to have it directly implemented into your router or locally on your machine. I don´t think the Mozilla approach is useless. It´s a better than nothing approach. Last, but not least you can use different DoH servers in FF. You are not tied to the default. Though the average Joe may not have the ability to use a custom DoH server in their Firefox.
BTW, what router manufacturer already has DoT implemented?

Thanks for explaining.
Have there ever been serious flaws in that signature verification Would you regard it safe enough for the paranoid among us or would you advise to better download the full package and do the standard pgp verification? I read from some people who only do the latter and don´t use the builtin updater.
