@_subject: Slashdot banning Tor? 
I still don't understand why so many sites seem to equate IPs with
users.  Or why they can't just ban UIDs and/or prevent *anonymous*
posting via tor.  But then, I can't understand how people can be called
editors and not edit for things like grammar, spelling, incorrect links,
and duplicates.
I guess once my login cookie disappears, I might have to stop bothering.
