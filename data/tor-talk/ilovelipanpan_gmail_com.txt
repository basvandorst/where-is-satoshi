Thanks.virtualbox xp system is host-only,I can use chrome and tor browser
to surf internet,I see the proxy is 127.0.0.1 9150,so I write this into
QQ's proxy settings,but the QQ can not log in,I did not know why,the
virtualbox xp system's firewall is off.
This is the phenomenon,help me,thank you.

I set the socks5 proxy in QQ as 127.0.0.1 9150 ,it did not work
another question:The netstat shows below,so if tor listening on port 9150
and 9151,why tor also listening on port 1349?Thanks for the answer
