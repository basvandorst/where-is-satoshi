I came home today to find a rather unpleasant e-mail sitting in my inbox.  It was a DMCA Complaint from the MPAA, for "CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, THE". I
scratched my head for a few minutes, trying to figure out if I had
downloaded that movie on my server. I was really quite sure that I hadn't
downloaded it, or any movies at all. I wondered if they might have
misidentified a legitimate torrent. Then it dawned on me - with the recent
talk about BitTorrent over tor, it probably was someone using BitTorrent
over tor.  I've temporarily changed my configuration to ExitPolicy reject
*:*, until I can figure out a more precise way of blocking BitTorrent.
I'd very much like to continue running a tor server, but I can't afford to do it if I'm going to receive DMCA Takedown notices.
Has anyone else had this problem? Any suggestions?

1) It was sent to my ISP, not directly to me.
2) It seemed real enough for them to pass it on to me.
Here's a snippet:

I'm wondering what the reasoning behind not including NNTP in the standard ExitPolicy is. Surely the same arguments that apply to open Web access also apply to open newsreading?
Can it be considered for inclusion in the ExitPolicy of future tor

We're talking about the installer .exe, not tor itself, right? Isn't it
possible that the compressed version of tor coincidentally happens to
match a signature in AVG's database?

It would be helpful to know where on your system you found the binary...

If anyone wants to hear what it actually sounded like, I've uploaded the clip. Unfortunately, it's a rather odd file... XviD inside a QuickTime wrapper. mplayer and VLC both play it correctly:
