@_subject: [tor-talk] [TBB] Can userContent.css change my fingerprint? 
Hi all,
I would like to create/modify the userContent.css file
( to overwrite
the stylesheet of websites, but I read all over the place that changing
settings of the tor browser is not recommend because can differentiate my
fingerprint from others tor users!
So I don't understand if this change can modify my fingerprint and/or if
an enemy (websites, governments) can see that
