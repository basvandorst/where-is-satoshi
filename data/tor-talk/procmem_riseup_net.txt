@_subject: [tor-talk] Fingerprinting of Media Players 
Hi I had a question on the safety of using third party mediaplayers
outside Tor Browser so I can document it for our users.
With Whonix, IP and DNS leaks are not a problem however can using VLC
leak information about installed codecs on a system to the site?
Does VLC have cookies that can tracked?
Can the media rendering speed of a machine be remotely detected? - This
last one is important in cases where people run opensource youtube app
alternatives thru Orbot.

Hardly. Tor Browser uses the Gstreamer framework too. Dear gk please
chime in about your experiences which are very relevant to this question.

Every Google reCaptcha feeds their neural network used by the DoD to

radioactive to Google.

Congrats. Tails is a great inspiration for Whonix and it's been a
pleasure to work with you guys! :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] v3 Onion Services that host Mixmaster SMTP Nodes 
Whonix dev here. Does anyone know of Mixmaster remailers that are hosted on v3 onions? v2
will be EOL at some point soon. The ones we currently have listed in Whonix are:
None of these have public pages that can inform users of upcoming
changes or developments. If you host a Mixmaster node or know someone
who does, please ask around if they are accessible via an Onion v3 address and let us know.

@_subject: [tor-talk]  v3 Onion Services that host Mixmaster SMTP Nodes 
Interesting, How could you tell?
What node is this?
This is precisely why we need them because direct clearnet access in
Whonix is not an option.
I'm not interested in webmail or s services where you need to register
to use. They are also a single point of surveillance/failure.
That's not why I'm asking...
The point is, many of them have pinger stat pages and I was wondering if
there are some you know of that list an Onion as alternative access on
their project sites.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Connection padding set to 1 vs auto 
Hi. I was wondering if setting the connection padding setting in torrc
to 1 instead of auto has any benefit in protecting against a passive
adversary outside the Tor network.

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Tor Browser without Tor 
Whonix now provides a hardened vanilla Debian spin (no Tor used) that
ships a version of Tor Browser that is exactly this. It is rebranded so
people are not confused about what it does.
