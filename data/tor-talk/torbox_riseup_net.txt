HS + SSL makes sense:
- stronger encryption
Not looking too long for a good source...
If you decide to run a hidden service Tor generates an  RSA-1024
keypair. The .onion name is computed as follows: first the  SHA1 hash [...]
Arguably, that are not the recent, most secure algorithms. I think they
have already a few tickets to enhance the strength of the keys.

I think the concept of hidden services has a lot potential. Not only
because they are hidden. Let's face it:
- You get a free domain for live.
- You get transparent, free end to end encryption. No flawed root CA system.
- That's something remarkable, isn't it?
With some modifications/improvements they could be potentially used for
any website, such as as e-commerce, google, twitter, facebook etc.
hidden services "1.0" as of July 2012 features:
- "optional" [1] client anonymity
- "optional" [2] server anonymity
- somewhat slow both, when client anonymity and server anonymity are active
- free live time domain
- no domain registrar can mess up
- somewhat [3] secure
- very few useful legitimate hidden services exist [4]
ideas for hidden services "2.0":
- Marketing: Free domain for live!
- Marketing: Safer than SSL!
- "optional" [1] client anonymity
- "optional" server anonymity
- add an option to let the server and/or client connect non-anonymously [6]
- somewhat slow both, client anonymity and server anonymity are active
- fast if only one uses anonymity
- very fast if none use anonymity
- establish new human friendly name system [7]
- improved stability, reachability, performance and dos protection features
- More legitimate hidden services. Better reputation for Tor.
- Real solution for the flawed root CA system.
- Say goodbye to the DNS hierarchy system, DNS spoofing etc. Free
domains, domain security depends on local security, not on registrar /
DNS system.
- Tor gets more known and gets more relay / bridge contributors.
- Safes exit bandwidth.
[1] Optional because if Tor2webMode is set to 1: Tor connects to hidden
services non-anonymously. As far I know it connects to the rondevouz
point directly, server of course stays anonymous.
[2] There are exit enclaves. The server acts as exit and allows to exit
to it's own IP.
[3] Please don't make that the topic here. What I mean is the domain
name may not be long enough, weak sha1 hash and the encryption keys are
not the most up to date, strongest ones.
[4] Depends on opinion, anyway, much more legitimate and useful servers
can not hurt. Let's not make this the topic here.
[5] One hop circuit or can you even make a 0 hop circuit, i.e. direct
[6] Non-anonymous domains could use something else, not .onion.
[7] There is already at least one proposal, pet name system.

Self-signed: no normal people will read and understand the warning
message and act properly.
Hidden service 2.0 domain: for example banking institution give out a
ultra mini USB device, similar to USB pendrive but much smaller with
only 100 KB space. It costs something like 0,01/0,10 $ and contains an
url which will be automatically opened. Would result in correct domain +
correct fingerprint + strong encryption. The user can bookmark it domain
So yes, they have to get the hidden service domain (0 hop) over a secure
channel, that can be the usual channels such as google, friends, real
world advertisements and letters, calling them etc.
The current real world problem with SSL root CA encryption is not to the
correct domain, it's hard to verify easily the fingerprint. And if we
can combine url + fingerprint check, that would be awesome.

If the software is good it can be integrated into any operating system,
just like direct x is on any recent windows or gpg is in any recent
linux distro.
I didn't mean this.

Optional client authentication could be also added for hidden services
2.0. There are some use cases. For what would we need a trust chain?
Certificate protection depends on local security.

It's a wide question. What are you interested in?
What do you want to know about? Server software, operating system
security, side channel attacks, Tor client security or Tor network
security? Or everything?
I don't understand the question. Please rephrase.

Maybe. Would require development which no one wants to take.
You can remove all proxy settings in Tor Button and connect directly.
You will get the Tor Browser fingerprint without using the Tor network.
Must be somewhere in Tor Button source code.
What you want to archive is very difficult. The list of Tor exists is
You could chain another proxy (or SSH, or VPN) behind Tor, i.e. Tor ->
proxy. The proxy must be private, not in some public proxy list. On the
other hand that's not recommend, since it adds a permanent observer.
And tweak Tor Browser until it looks like you want or tweak Firefox
until it adds the security features and looks you like.

Yes, but its even more. Also some addons are hard to make them work.
Adblock for example changes your fingerprint because you download a part
from a website but other parts not, the server can recognize that.
Sadly, if you do this as the only person, you stand out even more as
with regular Firefox. If you hide everything, you are in the group of
"people who hide everything" and if there are only a very few people in
this group it's very easy to identity.
BUT, if many people were to use Tor-Browser-without-Tor and if you are
on dynamic IP, that would even grant some privacy. And even some
"anonymity" * within your IP range within the set of
Tor-Browser-without-Tor users.
* For server's perspective: some anonymity.
* From providers / hackers / law enforcement perspective: As soon as IP
logs get deleted you also have some anonymity.
It would require a debate here, interested people and a campaign to get
lots of users for it.
See Tor Browser and Tor Button design docs, Tor Browser / Button trac
tickets, related discussion etc. There is much more which will be used
for tracking.
I see.
For your question it might be the easier to modify Tor Browser.

Depends on virtualizing platform and settings.
For Virtual Box...
cat /proc/cpuinfo
Power off VM. Restart VM. Then run:
VBoxManage modifyvm "VMname" --synthcpu on
check again:
cat /proc/cpuinfo
Hides some things but does not hide CPU frequency.
At high cost of speed, that may be different for full emulators such as
Bochs or qemu, if they emulate a whole cpu instant of virtualizing them.

My non-offical project supports [1] that. Java and Flash do not leak IP
or DNS.
There is some protection against hardware fingerprinting as well. [2]
Remaining issues (flashcookies, which can track you across multiple
sessions and so on) are also documented. [3] Don't hold your breath for
fixing the remaining flash issues, I am certainly not going to do it.
That would require a flash rewrite with privacy protection (project like
gnash, which isn't a big success yet).
You can build such system also from source or manually build it, it's
all documented.

Any threads which are not listed in the link I've posted?
Like written, consider the Flash / Java usage in TorBOX pseudonymous
instant of anonymous due to the fingerprinting / likability functions of
those plugins. Also a good option just for circumvention of censorship.
For people who really can't abstain from Flash / Java it's the best
option I know of.
Different thread model, target user group, history and features.
Tails is an respected, established live CD. Based on Debian and Tor.
When Tails gets rooted, the users real IP address can leak.
TorBOX is an anonymous general purpose operating system. Based on Ubuntu
and Tor. Persistent. Young project. In TorBOX's thread model the client
(TorBOX-Workstation) can be compromised and there will be still no IP or
DNS leaks. The only way to connect is through the TorBOX-Gateway. [1] [2]
[1] The way to hack TorBOX would be to hack the VM and to infect the host.
[2] If you want even more security (also more complicated) you can even
use Physical Isolation. TorBOX-Gateway and TorBOX-Workstation run on
different hardware.
Master thesis anyone? There is probable a lot to say.
- Virtual Box is free and open source
- nice user interface
- supports internal networks
- does not emulate (much), but virtualize (faster)
- cross platform
- fast

Actually the project does not market itself very well. Instant of having
a small front page we have too much technical and security related
information there. Developers are not the best documentation writers. If
you wrote it, some things are totally clear for you and you mess up
explaining them.
That will change with the next release. It will be as simple as
installing Virtual Box, downloading the two VMs, importing the VMs,
starting the two VMs, done. Perhaps I make a screenshot tutorial.
But what will never change is, the more anonymity/privacy/security you
want, the more technical knowledge you'll need. We'll continue to
provide loads of additional information to make it even more safe.
A simplified option, lacking many security features is TransparentProxy
Anonymizing Middlebox. [1]

Must be a "quite modern" system. Sorry, I can't go into detail, I
haven't made a comprehensive benchmark with various machines.
If hardware supports virtualization, i.e. the CPU features AMD-V or
VT-x, it works much better.

You can read [1].
It's not that simple. Using a tiny Linux would lead into less security
by default provided by TorBOX.
And finally TorBOX is simply a collection of Linux commands and
configuration files, automated with bash scripts. The concept works
anywhere with anything. After some work you can use any operating
system. [2] People with special needs can build there own images.
Unfortunately I've learned it's impossible to support all use cases at once.
If other people with knowledge from other operating systems would join
the project we could make the operating system choice an option.
