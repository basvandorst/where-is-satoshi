Good day,
I am new to this list, but not so new to TOR.
I was using  as a guide to create a similair case of transparant proxy. I used my own script though.
First I would like to point out that the following rules did not work for me:
~ iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
~ iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT --to-ports $_trans_port
Probably the REDIRECT part is wrong. I had to use DNAT insead:
~ iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to 127.0.0.1:53
I am not sure if this is a difference between the version of iptables used in the article and the one I am currently using?
* Article: iptables 1.3.5 or later
* Me: iptables v 1.4.21
Or did I miss configure my kernel? (I compile my own). I was at the point of updating the wiki article about it, including the incorperation of this warning:
But fist I wanted to double check if the error was not on my side.
