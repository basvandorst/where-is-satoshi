@_subject: Gentoo's response on them blocking access to their forums via 
I am a Gentoo Developer (I'm no demigod S.K. :) ) I maintain the tor
ebuilds. I am a forum moderator (altough in the past months i have not
used the forums much) And i followed this thread and the one in the
moderators forum with interest. I can now assure the Tor users that work
is being done to allow tor users read-only access to the forums (the
GET/POST idea would make the use of search impossible).

@_subject: Tor hogging cpu 
I'm running 0.0.9.4 on linux x86 (2.6.10 kernel with grsec and nptl
glibc) and have been running the server for a few days and now:
I'm going to stop the process and restart it.
There is nothing in the logs that acuses some kind of problem.
