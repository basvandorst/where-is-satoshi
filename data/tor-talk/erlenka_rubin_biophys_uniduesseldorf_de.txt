@_subject: Function of Tor 
Hy everybody.
I hope that I'm on the right list to post my questions. :)
I've installed Tor on my Linux system and I see, that there is a
tor-daemon running (/usr/bin/tor).
My questions are: a) If I'm browsing the web, Do I use the Tor-System,
and how could I test this?
IIRC the download speed should be much slower if I use Tor, but it
seems, that I got the max. speed.
Thanks a lot for your help.
