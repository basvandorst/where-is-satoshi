One of the things I love about being an IT Professional is, in general, being really smart. One of the things I hate about being an IT Professional is when the "really smart" look down their nose at someone who apparently can't do something simple.
    USENET from 1992 is pretty much finished and I would personally be gratified, not that it matters, if you just explained the proper command to the guy instead of proving to me, and everyone else, that indeed you have mastered Majordomo.
    I, for one, wasn't impressed. There's probably a good amount of "user class" subscriptions to this list. Try to remember that those folks actually get attention from women, and have what we, the IT People, only dream of: Lives.
    Yes, I've had a bad day. But please... be nice.

@_subject: Safe destinations 
Agreed.
    Agreed.
    Agreed.
    Disagreed. I'm not sure how a limited exit policy makes a defacto statement about the intent of the administrator. Any exit node could be used for cleartext snooping. Even a node with permissive exit policies can be snooped selectively.
    Gregory, while the behavioral outcome of what you are proposing is speculation, you would also have to expect that many (some) non exit relays would choose to exit to safe services. My guess is that overall network bandwidth would go up.
    A community maintained list, not associated with the Tor Project, might provide an answer. We could easily dig up all the IP/port information needed to create "safer" exit policies.
    I still like the idea of allowing administrators the ability to create a rule in the form of:
    Accept *.google.com:80
    Accept *.google.com:443
    From my standpoint it seems most functional from an exit node operator's standpoint.
    From a technical standpoint I have little idea what it means to the directory for additional rules like this to be included. At face value it may be trivial (please notice the word "may"). I'm also not a good enough programmer, so I really can't dive into the Tor source and be able to tell the issues involved with my suggested *.domain.tld:port     I've been doing a little code monkeying in python with the idea of being able to create a list of *.domain.tld:port lists with an automated output to torrc followed by a HUP. Sadly, in order to pull this off with any real elegance, I need to be able to get a zone transfer from the target domain's name server- which is not likely. However, it does work on my own domains and name server. So the concept at least works for local domains.
    At this point it's still easier to grope for the DNS information, and construct IP:port exit rules by hand.

Hi all,
    I've been watching the numbers of routers fluctuate between 1500 and 1800 for some time now. I've also noticed a correlation that my Tor surfing is a lot faster when there are 1800 relays as opposed to 1500.
    Anyone else notice this?
    Also, as a side question: At what point is a relay marked "stable"?

@_subject: General question about exit policies... 
============================== START ==============================
    Hi all,
    One thing I do not see is support for an exit policy such as:
    accept *.yahoo.com:80
    accept *.google.com:80
    Is this type of statement supported but undocumented, and what would people think of having that ability?
    From my standpoint, it would certainly make running an exit easier for me to handle from an abuse management standpoint. In this way server admins who might have servers in unfriendly environments could perhaps allow exits to hard to abuse locations that are high traffic sites. Thus increasing bandwidth overall.
    And while I know I can dig up the addresses myself with some degree of accuracy and provide exit in that manner, it would allow admins to ensure that the port that was opened, was actually being used for the protocol for which it was intended, by only allowing exit to an intended     This isn't a judgment about the people using Tor, but rather a tool that admins can use to provide bandwidth in a less risky manner.

@_subject: A Few Random Thoughts... 
Hi all,
    As one of those lucky souls with access to almost limitless bandwidth and the skills (or stupidity) to use it, I suppose an apology is in order:
    I'm sorry- after reviewing what *could* be the consequences, I have to whimp out based on professional risk factors... I can't run an exit node. So I have to leave it to other folks who have a different situation to do the heavy lifting.
    What I *am* doing is deploying a couple of heavy iron closed relays on OC3 or better bandwidth. The first is now deployed after a lot of up and down testing, and I'll get to the second in due time.
    I've been watching Tor for a long time and just recently decided to get involved. The Iran situation cemented that decision.
    Anyhow, here are some random thoughts:
    On the "Who uses Tor?" section of the website, I see no mention of IT people. I've used the Tor network for many practical uses as an IT Director. These range from bypassing my own firewall to test incoming connections, to helping my legal department do research on a pending lawsuit without the opposition *knowing* we even looked at their website. Having a random and easily accessible IP to initiate connections from is a priceless testing tool. Especially when dealing with niggling routing problems.
    On one occasion my ISP was having routing/DNS problems, and Tor was able to find an entrance node and allow me to work even though I couldn't get to my remote servers directly. This saved my client a lot of downtime, and might have saved me the account. Also, my employer's R&D department sometimes needs to look at things they don't want anyone to know they looked at (All quite legal mind you).
    Quite frankly Tor is an undervalued IT tool and it's capabilities should be trumpeted loudly on the web page. You might also find IT guys like me throwing up some relays in exchange. After all- who has the bandwidth anyway?
     And before anyone accuses me of it, I'm not nearly stupid enough to do a port scan over Tor. Phew.
    One of the issues I ran into when looking into running an exit relay had to do with not only the legalities, but identifying a server vendor that was offshore from my home country and friendly to a Tor exit. In order for me to run an exit node, I have to be completely shielded.
    As it stands now, I can probably run an exit for instant messaging- and that's it. However, if Tor itself had a relationship with someone who rents hardware, perhaps a partnership, Tor could get the exit nodes it needs, and the server vendor could get lots of cash. From my standpoint, it doesn't matter whether I rent or colocate my hardware. So if Tor as an organization had a partnership with a few server rental whores (in multiple countries), it would simplify getting more exits. I need servers, Tor runs with little impact on my server, I could care less where my remote hardware is provisioned from. Bingo- more exits.
    I read back about 6 months in the or-talk list and there were a couple of suggestions inferring that *everyone* should be forced to be an exit node. I think this is a very bad idea, and hurts the security of the person trying to remain anonymous by causing an identifiable change in bandwidth usage that could infer Tor usage (Information leakage).
    Simply speaking, on a default Windows/Vidalia installation, outgoing Tor traffic usually looks like https traffic, but on a forced exit, now Tor is identified by relatively matched traffic on port 443 both in and out of the client's connection (Unless it's entrance node is a *nix variant). This could mean death (literal) for a political dissident who is now identified as having an in/out matching traffic pattern assuming his entrance node is on Windows. It is more likely, that a country monitoring it's citizens would miss simple https traffic. But even myself as a lowly IT director, would have alarm bells going off if https was initiating in two directions from the same machine. Alternative ports can also set off alarm bells. But given the nature of Onion Routing, two way traffic needs to be avoided in the most sensitive sensitive situations. Forcing exit nodes is a bad idea for users. It will also drive away anyone who cannot provide an exit node.... that's chasing away bandwidth as non exit relays run for the hills.
    Long post. Too much coffee and too much time staring at routing tables.

@_subject: Suggested IT Text... Edit or destroy as fitting. 
Not to jump in with both feet, but here's some possible starting text ideas for the "IT People Use Tor" section...
    Ahem...
    "IT Professionals use Tor:
    * To verify IP based firewall rules: A firewall may have some policies that only allow certain IP addresses or ranges. Tor can be used to verify those configurations by using an IP number outside of the company's alloted IP block.
    * To bypass their own security systems for sensitive professional activities: For instance, a company may have a strict policy regarding the material employees can view on the internet. A log review reveals a possible violation. Tor can be used to verify the information without an exception being put into corporate security systems.
    * To connect back to deployed services: A network engineer can use Tor to remotely connect back to services, without the need for an external machine and user account, as part of operational testing.
    * To access internet resources: Acceptable use policy for IT Staff and normal employees is usually different. Tor can allow unfettered access to the internet while leaving standard security policies in place.
    * To work around ISP network outages: Sometimes when an ISP is having routing or DNS problems, Tor can make internet resources available, when the actual ISP is malfunctioning. This can be invaluable is crisis situations.
    * The CTO is an asshat: Your CTO is a golf loving moron who hasn't spent any time in front of a computer since 1988. He bought some crappy appliance, which sits at the edge of your network, tracking your activity, while you track everyone else's activity- including his. This Mongolian Cluster Fuck never seems to end. Root Cause Analysis sessions go on for days on end. Plans are made to DDOS his Comcast cable connection, one of your assistants claims he can bed the CTOs wife, and the accounting system is missing data (really- it's the CTOs missing porn collection). Cooler heads prevail... you just install Tor and read     Ok, maybe the last one isn't salvageable. I gave it my best shot.

Roger,
    Come to think of it I have a question about best practices. My first Tor server is racked in the same datacenter as apparently two other Tor servers, one is an exit. Should I name these as family in my config?
    I'm thinking yes. But since I don't own the other servers I'm hesitant. But at face value it might make sense to disallow building circuits through them.

@_subject: Question About Security Threat from Tor 
Hi Jim,
    Not so much related to Tor itself, but more toward general security. If a standard user account were to be compromised, that's the first step in getting control of a machine. Even with Tor running as an unprivileged user, if a security problem were exploited, that could lead to unprivileged access to the machine- then the attacker just has to find a suitable way to crack the box through an exploit, polluted binaries, or even a scripted dictionary attack on the box from inside. But you run this same risk from any internet facing service.
    The best first defense is to make sure everything is patched (Along with the standard fire walling, log analysis, and general paranoia).  From a personal standpoint, I usually recommend so called "enterprise" distributions of Linux or BSD variants. They don't always have the latest wizbang features, but from a security standpoint they have been bashed about enough that they might be a little more hardened than others.
    This is of course from the standpoint of *nix.
    On a Windows XP or earlier setup, most user servers are running with administrative privileges. You can guess where that can end up. It's better (a bit) on server versions of Windows.
    I can't comment on anything related to OSX, the last version I ran was developer release one. But the principles are the same.

Hi Bill,

    By using "ExitNodes" and "StrictExitNodes" you could specify which exit relay you would use for testing.

As an aside,
     This is true, assuming the upstream protocol uses ethernet signaling, wasn't there some old point to point protocols where the MAC was ignored?
     I seem to remember something like that. I know ATM, FDDI, Bluetooth, and PPP/PPPOE use MAC addresses. SLIP, if my old brain is functioning, did not.
     I think there were others too. But I'm too old and salty to remember them all.
     Xerox sure got some mileage off of ethernet addressing huh? I'm wondering if they made any money on it.

@_subject: Anonymity easily thwarted by flooding network with relays? 
Roger,
     I'm not sure as a career sys admin that I am qualified to really comment on this. But in order for this attack to work, you have to correlate the input data to the entry node to the output data to the exit node (as you have said). That can be done by measuring timing and size of the data.
     Getting around this seems to me to be easy. All that has to happen is the addition of garbage data from the client which is then stripped out on the exit node. That way the data going into the network has a false size, always larger than what is actually being transported, this happens in the first layer of the "onion". So the data in, never equals the data out and vice versa.
     At that point *timing* is the only correlating factor. And with the latency of the tor network, that would be very hard to track, with the perceived security going up on busier guard and exit nodes. Also, some slight random latency could be introduced (smallish factor, 1 to 10 ms) for all middle nodes, muddying the waters even more.
     Like I mentioned before, I'm not really qualified to comment on this. I use tor as an IT tool for security and offsite testing.
