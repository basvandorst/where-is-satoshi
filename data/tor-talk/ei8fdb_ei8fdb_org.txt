Is there a reason 1024 bit keys, instead of something higher is not used? Do higher bit keys affect host performance, or network latency?
Written on my small electric gadget. Please excuse brevity and (probable) misspelling.
a second guess would be going after 1024 bit keys.
there is also a video on youtube from a recent con about the feasibility of
factoring them, <"fast hacks" or something like that> at the end, jacob
applebaum asks about it and they advise him to use longer keys or elliptic
curves crypto.

That's what I was thinking, I just didn't know if there was another reasons.
I guess the key size is configured on the Tor node? I haven't found it anywhere in the configuration (I'm using TBB on OS X).
Is it possible to increase the size of the key, if say I've got a big server running as a node?
If there are nodes using different length keys, is the security relying on the node with the smallest key length?

But by then (presuming it took more than X months) would the information contained inthe encrypted messages not be "worthless/little?". Or is it the "the more data we have the better" approach?

Hi Roger,
Maybe a silly question, but what do the blue and red dots signify on the "directly connecting users from..." graphs?
Is help at rt.tp a public list anyone can join?
jobs@ is for jobs AT Tor? Or something else?
thanks a lot,

One curious question:
In Firefox there is an auto-update option under advanced preferences. [1] TBB is based on Firefox but the auto-update option is not present. [2]
It would have not "saved" the compromise of the THS services recently, but is there a reason why the Firefox update was removed?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Running a Tor exit node on a VPS: does location of node 
Hash: SHA1
Hello all,
I am researching running a Tor exit node on a hosted VPS. I am currently looking at a big list of VPSs ( - thanks Moritz).
Most are similar - bandwidth, RAM, disk, IPs, etc.
For me as the operator of the node, does the location of the node, or more importantly the location of the datacentre/s where the VPS will live have any impact?
As a European country citizen does it make sense to locate the node in the US/Canada/Asia/Europe?
NB: I have no intention of using this node for illegal purposes, but seeing as this is the Tor network I cannot guarantee illegal usage will not occur.
Any thoughts?

I could be very much mistaken but that looks like the list (and map visualisation) of Tor nodes worldwide. Each node location is plotted on the map.
I don't think there is any geolocation from the users POV. Maybe I misunderstand the question tho'?

When I first saw your list Coderman, it wasn?t clear if there was anything newer than July, so I?ve ordered them in reverse chron order.
Also, in terms of articles to add - is it just English, or are other languages also requested? I added on Danish article tagged as [DK] as it came up in my search. I?ll remove it if required.
However, maybe an idea to organise by other languages too?

Not telling the Tor people what to do, but that sounds like a good discussion to have with Safeplug?
I was thinking the exact same thing when I read about it.
If anyone does hear about a non-technical user purchasing one of these, I would appreciate if you could put them in touch with me. I?d like to do some user interviews to see their reactions and their experiences.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Exit node stats collection? 
I have been running a reduced exit policy, a slight variation on the mentioned approach here. [1]
Up until this week I've had no major issues, apart from one notice from the ISP, which was dealt with reasonably effectively.
My issue my is keeping the exit node online.
To answer the OP: how can we tell "malicious users" from "valid users". I understand your POV, but surely we can't discriminate? Or can we?

This is true, but people will use what they can if they have difficulties. Anything that helps people installed TBB must be useful, right?
I've had a look around, but I haven't come across any "official Tor Project videos" to help people get TBB installed on [insert OS]?
Are there any created? If not, I could try and do some short videos for Debian, OS X. Just using the "official" steps direct from TP website.

From your government's website? You mean adding the repo ppa:upubuntu-com/tor? If so, then true, the user has no clue about where the install is coming from. But possibly, neither do they know..
Fair point, but to counter this the user needs education *before* they download TBB from *whereever*.
If the user is already at the point of already having it on their computer, they have downloaded it, and their intention is to install it.
They need education of the best place to get it from, as opposed to from some (potentially) dodgy youtube video.
If a video shows how to do it insecurely, but a well-written, but technical FAQ explains the same, some people will choose the nice and simple video.
I don't agree this is right, but this is what people do.
There was no audio. Just some randomer hightlighting text in a textpad to show the step he/she was on.
If we could do some simple steps in the video for signature checking, they'd also help.
Ok, I'll try that this weekend.
Incidentally, is anyone on the list going to Open ITP's CTS? If anyone is interested in meeting up, I'll be there. Let me know on/off-list.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPN then Tor - is this safe? 
Hash: SHA1
Hi there,
Genuine question from someone today:
- - they use a VPN service (I think Witopio?)
- - they want to use Tor browser to surf safely
They asked can they "safely" use Tor through their VPN service. When
questioned they meant "will Tor give me enough protection to browse
the web anonymously".
My first answer was let me find out. My personal opinion was if they
connect to the VPN service *first* then connect to Tor it was safer
than doing it vice-versa. Correct/false?
Any helpful opinions welcome.

Hash: SHA1
Thanks for the reply.
In this person's case, they trusted the ISP less as it is a UK ISP and
so subject to the recent "Cameron Porn Filter", and all other filters
that are probably coming down the track.
Regarding the VPN provider, I don't know how trustworthy witopio is.
When you say "except when the VPN reconnects" you mean the VPN
end-point reconnecting to the Tor node, or the end-user reconnecting
to the VPN node? I presume the latter.
Good point. I will find out more.

We mean ?design? in the broadest sense, from user research, to interface and interaction design, typography, and usability testing ? all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges. Designers, and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.
What and how to submit
RECORDING AND LICENSING:
It is quite likely that the talks in the Open Source Design devroom will be audio and video recorded. By submitting a proposal you consent to be recorded and agree to license the content of your talk under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license.
30-minute presentations (we are leaving 15 minutes for questions and discussion).
SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
1st December 2014
HOW TO SUBMIT:
All submissions are made in the Pentabarf event planning tool at
When submitting your talk in Pentabarf, make sure to select the ?Open source design devroom? as the ?Track?.
