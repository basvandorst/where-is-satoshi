@_subject: [tor-talk] How does Tor REALLY work? 
I've got a bunch of notes from perusing the source code trying to understand it.
It sounds like it would be a great project for someone that is just
getting into Tor and already knows C (I hope I didn't just volunteer
myself for the project...)
My question would be, how likely is it that the architecture that you
just described would be changing anytime soon?
I think any documentation written to such an end would have to strike
a balance between being detailed enough to be useful and not too
detailed in that parts of it get outdated rather quickly.
I was thinking about doing this for the JTor implementation as I have
been digging into that a decent amount the last few weeks.

Right, so the methodology used in keeping the code doc updated is important.
Also, it wouldn't have to be a tome to start with. I think it would be
handy just to describe some of the high level functionality like you
just did earlier. So when someone wants to get started with looking at
the code they can at least get a high level overview of where things
live and how they interact.
Keeping in mind that nothing is ever going to replace just rolling up
your sleeves and diving in, but at least you wouldn't have to dive in
blindfolded. In my experience every code base has a lot of code that
while important, most people don't really need to look at or touch to
be productive.

It seems that the tor Doxygen isn't published anywhere? From this
it looks like it hasn't been kept up to date. Maybe that would be a
good first step? Getting the doxygen up to date and in  a publicly
accessible place?

I'll give the doxygen build a shot tonight or this weekend.
