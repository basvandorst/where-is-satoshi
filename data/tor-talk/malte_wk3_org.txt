I also like to email my providers and ask them to stop blocking Tor. Don't expect a positive answer (or any answer at all), but sometimes a little nudge can work wonders.

Just a guess, but maybe you can just copy
tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default/prefs.js and

This could be mitigated by configuring the mailserver to require TLS, couldn't it?
Also a thought that just came to me: Taking mailserver which are configured to deliver via hidden services as described in  but make the hidden services use HidServAuth and HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient to exclude spammers.

On the website it says that it is "non-SMTP", but naif's requirement was to sent out SMTP mail in the end, wasn't it? So how would that work?

a lot of what you described sound like different parts of

- SMTPoverTor (
Maybe you can extend on that (like: integrating pond into Thunderbird

to bring this topic up again. I encounter more and more domains/pages
which deliver the plain text message:
They seem to come from big hosters like hostmonster.com and bluehost.com
(or maybe just those, I did not look into too many examples...).
The blocking does not entail all exit nodes, so with clicking "New Tor
Circuit for this site" in Tor Browser you are usually able to get
through in the end, but it is annoying, and you need to be aware that
you this might lead to success.
So a good first step might be to ask them to expand their block message
to be helpful for unexperienced Tor users. Any suggestions?
Also someone started a second Etherpad next to the original CloudFlare
one to collect blocked domains:

I would add to the list, that offering read-only access would be nice.
So just delivering the cached content instead of the captcha, would be a
very easy solution in that direction.

Quoting Virgil Griffith (2015-10-03 14:14:25)
Exactly. In case no cached version existed one could think of more
elaborate rules to reduce captcha usage even more, as for example
(although I'm not very well versed in HTTP) GET requests which have
no variables involved should work fine as well.
I don't know other people's browsing behaviour, but for me being able to
read the cached content would have sufficed in 100% of cases.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question 
(And since we are talking about high school students, I would add Yeah. I imagine two monitors next to each other, one displaying the HTTP requests as the server receives them the other one being used by the attendees to use the same web page from different clients.
To visualize the differences you might set the first display up to who the last to requests, compared via "dwdiff -c -P file1 file2" (or something similar).
A second step could then be to go into the wild Internet and show people how website deliver different pages depeding on different features of the requests (user agent, language, country of origin of the IP, etc.).
This would also give you an angle to rope in people who are not interested in anonymity per se, but are pissed when they are discriminated against.

It's totally Tor-friendly and basically uncensorable.

Maybe this is a good opportunity to invite people to Diaspora again.
It's still not perfect, but it's running for something like 5 years now
without major glitches and is only getting better.
It is tor-friendly (some admins even run relays and exits) and not
censorable in whole (admins of a Diaspora instance can take measures,
though, to block posts from another pod or a specific user).
You can find a list of pods you can register on on  and the general
project site on Easiest way to find posts on topics is via hashtags like on Twitter. The
hashtag streams for  on three exemplary pods:
What you can see is that the contents are similar but not equal as the
federation of posts depends on who is following who. Larger pods have a
more comprehensive list of public posts than smaller ones. I rather
consider this a feature than a bug.
See you there!
PS: I am search- and findable under the same handle that is this email

talky.io is one of the many reconnaissance sites for WebRTC, which is exactly what that built-in video chat is. But it is deanonymizing to its core, so it is disabled hard in Tor Browser.
I heard Tox can be used over TCP only, which would allow its usage over Tor:  (formerly tox.im, but that domain belongs to a person which is not trusted anymore).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Spamhaus. 
Quoting blobby at openmailbox.org (2016-08-12 14:18:16)
As far as I can tell Spamhaus has a de-facto monopoly on email
blocklists. So maybe others don't have the Tor exits in their lists
because they don't matter?
Yes. This means you cannot host a mail server and make it deliver email
over Tor, similar how you cannot host a mail server at home, because all
the end-user IP addresses are listed by Spamhau as well.
(This is different from having your mail client (e.g. Thunderbird)
connect to your mail server over Tor, these connections usually are
_not_ blocked.)
To filter mailserver-to-mailserver connections.
No. web/HTTP(S) traffic is filtered by other companies. Most notoriously
Cloudflare. But there are others as well. What makes them worse, is,
that they usually don't just provide blocklists, but do
man-in-the-middle the whole HTTP(S) traffic.

Please be aware that ports 80 and 443 are very likely to be used to
access "copyright-infringing" material, as they are used for HTTP and
Ports 110, 143, 465, 587, and additionally 993 are used by mail clients
to connect to their mail servers. So they should be safe as connections
usually require authentication.

Subgraph OS ships with a firewall that works pretty similar to Little
Snitch. The OS is based on Debian, so the portability of the firewall
application should be pretty high in theory, but maybe there is not
enough contribution-power, yet, to make that happen.
I can highly recommend to check it out anyway, and the fact that
Subgraph only allows internet-traffic to go over Tor makes it a bit more
