Greetings All:
It's been a while since I participated on a mailing list, and I did see a
portion of the discussion regarding Windows servers.  Ironically, I joined
the list because I wanted to ask how I could setup a Windows Tor server
(based on a Windows 2003 Server).  One thing that may add to the complexity
is that the Tor server may have to be located behind a Microsoft ISA 2004
server (on the same box).  However, certain ports may be opened (my admin
said "if you ask nicely").
Any links to articles or help would be appreciated (looking forward to
joining one of the "unknowns" on that list.
It is quite interesting that a majority of Tor connections are ostensibly
from Windows machines, considering that there are so few Windows machines
serving as Tor servers:
zermelo.eecs.harvard.edu:~ % wget -O -
"  | grep -A 1 "^router" | awk '{print
$5}' | grep "[A-Za-z]" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
104 Linux
12 FreeBSD
8 Unknown
6 OpenBSD
2 NetBSD
2 Darwin
Note that Windows machines refer to themselves as "Unknown", so there are
probably eight of them. Closer examination reveals that four of the eight
"Unknown" routers are unresponsive. This suggests to me that perhaps Windows
users are running into the problem observed by spy1 on  and his
intuition that this may be an effective deterrent to the proliferation of
Windows Tor nodes is probably accurate.
