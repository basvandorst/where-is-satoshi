Joe - I may be of some help, as I am working on an ongoing project tracking
the methods and behaviors of Iranian circumvention tool users. Between May
and August, I independently noticed something of a similar trajectory of
adoption numbers by Iranian users. What I've found in part is there are a
number of concurrent threads that likely contribute to the increase in
traffic, but don't account directly. These include:
*Increase of public awareness of Tor:* There are number of organizations and
individuals that have been promoting Tor in the country to political
*Less competition:* A number of services such as freegate and gtunnel have
reduced their availability to Iranians. Users have moved from HTTP proxies
to Ultrasurf and VPNs chiefly, but Tor has also benefited. This is probably
the biggest cause.
During the initial results of our research, it appears that there is a
meaningful correlation between political activism and specific tool use.
However, that's deserves a deeper explanation off list.

This is likely the cause of the jump in usage from Iran. However, this is

Tor would not be validating the nature or security of the hosted site,
rather the JSON would be confirming attributes of the visitor. I cannot
imagine many scenarios where a malicious party stands to benefit from
forging these credentials -- or for that matter a manner where they could
not fake a confirmation themselves without using the API.

Haha, well, I decided not to say, so I will not.

While it is important in being good stewards of the Internet to recognize

are other actors in this space that need to be recognized. Vendors such as
Huawei face less onerous export restrictions than most American and
European counterparts, often provided/subsidized by governments as
soft-power initiatives and are certainly equipped[1] to do the level of
mass surveillance and filtering that we see in countries such as Iran.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make 100.000 bridge? 
Runa, could you speak to the expectations of the bridge strategy regarding
the stability and lifespan of nodes? More specifically, to ensure a healthy
and stable network, how long should a volunteer attempt to maintain a
bridge (days, weeks or months)?
In the case of Amazon Web Services, there is the additional option of being
able to cycle address quickly -- this is helpful against blocking but
creates frustration with end-users unaffected by country-specific action.
Should a user maintain the bridge as long as there is traffic, for the good
of the network, or is changing addresses in response to external events
While Fabio's suggestion is novel, I suspect any volunteer using an shared
host would quickly find themselves facing the wrath of administrators.
Given the number of well-meaning, but unprepared people, I would be
cautious as it would potentially introduce a large number of unstable

Hi Juan,
So, this is perhaps a privilege (or corruption) of perspective, but
governments are not monolithic. The best description about this is a
statement by Gen. Hayden, former Dir. of the NSA and CIA:
*?We need to pull the rest of American thinking into this in a relevant
way.  Secretary Clinton gave two speeches on cyber stuff while she was
secretary.  And if you?re you know you think of the world as security and
liberty she broke left literally both times in both of her speeches she
came down on on cyber freedom.  Society at the same time cyber communities
out there are trying to crack the nut on anonymity on the net because you
realize that?s the root of many many dangers out there as cyber communities
just chugging away at that. The secretary of state is laundering money
through NGOs to populate software throughout the Arab world to prevent the
people in the Arab street from being tracked by their government.  Alright
so on the one hand we?re fighting anonymity on the other hand we?re
chucking products out there to protect anonymity on the net.?*
Imagine that, the former director of the NSA accusing the former Secretary
of State of working against US interests by promoting anonymity. Even the
US Government is a large beast with competing interests, some parts are
bent on security and intelligence, some are just science research oriented,
and some have a material stake in the Internet privacy.

Hi Mike,
Embarrassingly, I went straight to the most romantic hypothesis and then
worked my way back elsewhere, IRC and Twitter. A few of these prospects
could be reasonably addressed through the trends of the top fifty
countries, illustrated here: August 19-20.
Few other points of conjecture that came up:
   - I would infer based on no increase occurring in Iran that the Tor
   version being run by the agent is pre-2.4; Iran continues to implement
   countrywide DPI against Tor's SSL handshake, which was fixed for the moment
   in ticket  Whether it's circumvention or malware, I would trust it
   would hit Iran.
   - As Runa notes, attempting to correlate with censorship is not strong,
   I would propose however that based on relative growth, a better indicator
   is level of development (ehem, piracy) and geography. I might be passing
   over someone, but it isn't until you get to Japan (40th) that you run into
   what is traditionally called a highly-developed state (all apologies for
   the terrible phrasing of this).
   - Pirate Browser with Tor was released when, August 11th or 12th? I
   would expect we would see a more gradual and less synchronous incline if it
   were natural adoption patterns (short of an autoupdater).
  A) The change in user counts for each country should be proportional
I would also look for piracy and software update rates.
I culled the list at 1,000 users on either dates, there were a few
countries that cropped up with new users, like Anguilla. Macedonia and
Bosnia are also interesting toward this, regionally and going from a
hundred to a thousand.
Look for Muslim countries in the chart.
It's not.
Like, Hack the planet, bro.
So I think we are left with one unfortunate, not Israeli conclusion. Is
there an example of such fine grain statistics of botnet growth tagged with
date and country? Seems like a pretty solid research dataset for someone.
