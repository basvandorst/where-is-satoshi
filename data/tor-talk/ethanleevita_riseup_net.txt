I agree, but what about the email client for Tails? Will
Thunderbird/TorBirdy be available in Tails in the future? Or a way to
torify that client?

Pop servers (I don't use imap) don't connect while using TorBirdy, nor
do SMTP servers. It just sticks at 'Connecting to
pop.someserver.org...', not even asking for user password. SMTP comes up
with Thunderbird didn't connect to SMTP error. TorBirdy did work until I
upgraded from v0.0.4 to v0.0.9 and hasn't worked since (currently on
v0.0.10). I've been trying to figure this out for some time, but after
playing with Thunderbird settings, searching online, and updating to
other versions of TorBirdy (trying again every few days), I've had no
success and had to disable TorBirdy.
Could someone share some advice on where to look for a solution? I've
not seen any mention via online searches, this list, or the bug tracker
regarding anyone else having this problem, so I suspect its something on
my end.
I only have copies of github versions, so if someone could share the
xpis 5 & 6, I could report on which version I started having problems with.

Jacob Appelbaum:
I've had SSL/TLS enabled from the beginning of my Thunderbird use, with
and without TorBirdy, so that shouldn't be the problem. I've been using
port 465, which I read was the proper port for SSL to work with. And
using normal password authentication. I don't think it gets that far
though as it shows no sign of any successful connection and when not
working, doesn't prompt for any password.
What exactly do you want to know? I have both riseup & Google accounts,
having followed their config settings for server names & default ports
(995 for pop & 465 for SMTP), which I've rechecked repeatedly.
I've barely touched the config editor.
- - Changed network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to true when I attempted to
torify Thunderbird before TorBirdy. It didn't work so I changed it back
to false.
- - mail.server.default.autosync_offline_stores to true
- - use_status_for_biff to false (I don't use imap, but tweaked this in
case I ever changed my mind and forgot this existed)

Thanks. I realize that I could've done that, but a major reason I'm on
this list is to understand the hows and whys behind the technology. And
despite perusing the tor project website and its various links, I had
missed that particular page on Tails, so I'm thankful that I was shown
the pros and cons to Claws being included on Tails. I had also given up
subscribing to Tails discussion list because the page I had found for it
(Getting Started) didn't link to the archives, but I was prompted into
looking again and found the page (Contribute). I like to read archives
before subscribing so I know what to expect.
That and I much prefer to trust an encrypted disk with my email than a
server owned by people I 'trust' comparatively more than other entities.
Looking into Claws more, I've even begun to start experimenting with it.
Still like Thunderbird + enigmail + TorBirdy (when it works) for the
easy set-up amongst other reasons, but sometimes convenience isn't the
best security. And yet security must be conveniently-accessible if more
people are going to use it. I know I've enjoyed sharing Thunderbird +
Enigmail with people who thought encryption was too hard; I can't wait
to do the same with TorBirdy when its a bit more stable. So thank you to
all the developers, testers, researchers etc. I only hope my few
questions can be of value. :)
And thank you Katya for sharing Tbird's nature as a portable app.
Perhaps there is someone lurking on the list who was unaware and who
would be helped by this discussion.

Have you looked at mesh net and similar technologies and groups? Off the
top of my head, I'd recommend looking into CJDNS/hyperboria, I2P,
FreedomBox, Telecomix, Freenet, GNUnet.

install TorBirdy 0.0.10 and then
Finally had a few spare minutes to switch over to the guest account and
try it. Installed current TorBirdy, restarted, manually set up account
(gmail), changing the pop and SMTP settings as necessary, disabling the
default add-ons, but the exact same issue. Disabled TorBirdy, restarted,
connected fine.
BTW, the xpi linked to from the TorBirdy Tracpage is corrupted, and
based on file size, is an old version anyway. Might want to fix that link.

Exact same as my usual gmail settings (elucidated in reply to Jacob).
pop.gmail.com, port 995. SMTP.gmail.com, port 465. SSL/TLS connection,
normal password authentication. The point of trying the reinstall was to
have a clean slate, so I touched only account setup settings.
I'll check that in a moment.

Well, good news. I think I've figured out the problem. :)
Previously, I had been launching start-tor-browser from the extracted
archive and then attempting to get messages. However, when you asked me
to check connections in Vidalia, I went to the app directory and opened
it directly (I usually hide vidalia when launching from
start-tor-browser). And it showed connections. And worked. I suppose its
related to stream isolation not being in TBB yet?

I'm enjoying the back-and-forth and the learning that's coming. I tend
to inherently agree with Joe on the issue, but I'm enjoying learning
more about how the TBB deals with these issues, as well. Both of you are
providing an excellent educational service. :)
Mike, as to the issue of having enough time to fix the issues and deal
with questions as to how TBB works, I have a suggestion. I used to deal
with similar issues for a dev team and their discussion list in a
'community manager' role, so the devs could work on actual code and the
community could have someone to explain the process. I didn't write
code, but I had enough understanding and access to be able to explain
processes and deal with questions.
Is there somebody with enough understanding of TBB, yet without the same
coding ability that they'd be more useful fixing bugs, that could serve
a similar role answering user questions, update FAQs, explain important
bug fixes, pros and cons of changing different settings etc.
