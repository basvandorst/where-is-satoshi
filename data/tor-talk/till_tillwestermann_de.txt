if the person only wants surfing the web, torpark is the best thing.  It can be found here: Something to the stuff I read here: Its great that you write howtos  for newbies with nice pictures and so on. But if you write a howto,  keep in mind what peaple want to do. They dont wanna set up a server.  They wanna _use_ Tor. So a good idea is to make simple and straight  howtos that only show how to install Tor (or Torpark) and set up the  Browser. The rest is only confusing 95% of the users.
I know the problem: If I write things like this, I always feel like  an idiot. But I learned to igonre this to get better relults ;)
Enigma, thaks for your work. its a nice howto!
