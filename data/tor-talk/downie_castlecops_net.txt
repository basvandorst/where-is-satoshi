previously, if I started Vidalia when Tor was already running, I would be asked for the password.
Has this changed in 0.2.0.32 ? The torrc's I use for Vidalia or for the command line are different (and therefore the passwords are different).

Should I raise this as a bug at Flyspray?
Vidalia can see relay status etc, and shut down Tor without the password being entered.
They are both running as the same user however.

No, just the one process, started at the command line. Then starting up Vidalia, it connects to that process and has control over it. It doesn't start a second copy. That was the behaviour before the change to 0.2.0.32 as well, but it did prompt for a password back then.

@_subject: Problems starting relay 
I'm not mirroring the directory server (yet) so I assume I don't need to worry about the directory port.
I did enable UPnP on my router (temporarily) and tried the Test button in the Vidalia Relay setup page, and it reported 'Success'. However, on examining the Port Forwarding page, there was then no sign of a rule for Tor or Vidalia.
I disabled UPnP after that.
I'm using OSX 10.3.9.
I went into the Firewall section of 'Sharing' and added a rule for Tor:
"This is your firewall entry for Tor: it is currently on and all TCP network traffic on port(s) 9001 is being let through".
Yet still I get
"[Warning] Your server (xx.xx.xx.xx:9001) has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc"
My Port Forwarding rule (added manually) says
"Protocol TCP
Port Start 9001
Port End 9001
Port Map 9001"
  Is there a way I can check the Port Forwarding independently of Tor?

two questions:
I renamed (with 'mv') the file I was sending Tor logs to whilst Tor was I actually moved it to a different directory.
The log data kept being written to that file. How?
Secondly, does sending a USR2 signal to Tor 0.2.0.31 (r16744) switch on debug level logging as stated in the manual? I've tried it and it seems not to work - except I got some debug-level entries after I sent a shutdown signal.

@_subject: Problem with dynamic IP 
the Tor FAQs mentions bugginess with how Tor detects the IP of a relay when it isn't fixed.
I think I have this problem - the logs show Tor changing the IP it advertises to the world for the ORPort even though my IP has not in fact changed:
Nov 04 03:47:29.242 [Notice] Our IP Address has changed from xxx to yyy; rebuilding descriptor.
Nov 04 03:56:44.210 [Notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
Nov 04 04:17:58.142 [Notice] Our IP Address has changed from yyy to xxx; rebuilding descriptor.
Nov 04 04:19:05.460 [Notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
Nov 04 04:19:37.005 [Notice] Performing bandwidth self-test...done.
Nov 04 04:38:19.808 [Notice] Our IP Address has changed from xxx to yyy; rebuilding descriptor.
Nov 04 04:43:44.802 [Notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
Here yyy is the false IP - odd that it is supposedly reachable from the outside world.
The false IP is however on the right network, and could be one I had earlier in the day/week/month. Any idea how to stop this happening please? It's Tor 0.2.0.31 (r16744) MacOSX 10.3.9.
  Also, I'm advised to back up my relay's private key 'stored in "keys/secret_id_key" in your DataDirectory' . Where is that? I don't have a DataDirectory defined in the torrc.

I'm having trouble starting up a Tor relay.
Once I set up port forwarding (I've tried to set it up for TCP and UDP), should I be able to

b) Traceroute myself from a looking glass ?
At the moment neither of these work.
I get 'cannot confirm you can be seen from the outside world' errors.
I'm on a dynamic IP, Mac OSX, I haven't changed any of the defaults from the Vidalia bundle.

I downloaded the Vidlalia/Tor/Privoxy bundle all together.
I'm pretty sure my PC hasn't changed from 192.168.1.2 from the point of view of the router (there's nothing else on the LAN). It's a Safecom SWART2-54125 BTW.
Other than port forwarding, I have no idea what other settings there could be. I have software to prevent outgoing connections, but no software firewall to prevent incoming ones as far as I know - the router is supposed to handle that.

I'm trying to force the use of an exit node in France to view a site using .exit in the URL.
I get a 404 page with the exitnode in the error message:
"The requested URL /Images/.../ was not found on this server.
Apache/2.0.54 (Unix) PHP/4.4.0 Server at ..exit Port 80"
  This is the right Server identifier - I am getting through to the site but the hostname is being rejected because it contains the ..exit Presumably that should have been stripped by my Tor client or the exit I'm using Tor 0.1.2.19 OSX10.3.9

I have Privoxy, so that is possible (if anyone has the filter rule already I would appreciate it).
But if Privoxy strips the .exit bit, how does Tor then get the information about which node to use?

@_author: Geoff Down 
@_subject: Force exitnode oddness 
Those nice people at Privoxy have anticipated the need :)
+filter {hide-tor-exit-notation}
It looks like cookies are sent properly even though they are stored under the modified domain name.
It also looks like some page requisites (images etc) may be fetched from a different circuit i.e. not respecting the forced exit node. Could be a problem if the page contains absolute URIs.
It's an interesting problem. I suppose the only way to be sure is to edit the Tor config for strict-exit-nodes and restart it?
