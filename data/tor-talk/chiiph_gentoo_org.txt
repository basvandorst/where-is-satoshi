2010/12/8 Sebastian Lechte :
Which version of Vidalia are you running? I don't remember it changing
settings, since what it sets is passed through a parameter when it
starts Tor (i.e. the custom torrc file, controlport, etc).
To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with
unsubscribe or-talk    in the body.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia 0.2.14 is out! 
Hi everybody,
I'm happy to announce that Vidalia-0.2.14 is out, and yes 0.2.13 is too
(the changelog will clarify why two releases).
If you find any bugs or have ideas on how to improve Vidalia, please
remember to go to  and file a ticket for it!
You can find the tarball for this release here:
Here's what's new:
0.2.14  26-Aug-2011
  o Make the AutoPort setting default to false, so that it doesn't
    break backwards compatibility for people that aren't using Vidalia
    inside Tor Browser Bundle.
0.2.13  10-Aug-2011
  o Add a way to bootstrap Tor's torrc file (copy the torrc to a given
    directory before Vidalia starts) so that packages such as
    Bridge-by-default portable bundles for OSX don't violate the directory
    structure of the operating system. Fixes bug 2821.
  o Add the proper CA Certificates so that the "Find Bridges" button works
    again. Fixes bug 2835.
  o Update the useful links help page. Fixes bug 2809.
  o Reintegrate Breakpad, and make it available in platforms other than
    Windows. Resolves bug 2105.
  o Fix bandwidth assigned to relays on the Network Map. A lot of relays are
    displaying an erroneous bandwidth and since they are ordered by that
    value in the Network Map, it leads to confusion. Vidalia now specifies
    the bandwidth as the minimum of the three possible values (burst,
    average and observed). Fixes bug 2744.
  o Fix layouts in the configuration panel to make them look seamlessly
    across all platforms.
  o Add -no-remote parameter to Firefox so it allows another instance of
    non-TBB Firefox. Fixes bug 2254.
  o Add the possibility of changing the torrc path while Tor hasn't
    started. Fixes bug 3109.
  o Make the fact that bridges don't need a DirPort setting more clear by
    removing the content of the field when disabling it. Fixes bug 3119.
  o Improve command line parameter handling. Resolves bug 2965.
  o Fix layout in BandwidthGraph to display labels correctly in every
    language. Fixes bug 2500.
  o Updates README.debs to reflect the change in the packaging now that
    Vidalia uses Git. Fixes bug 3668.
  o Add a way to use the autoconfiguration for ControlPort and SocksPort.
    Tor can now autoconfigure Control and Socks Ports when the default ones
    are in use. This makes it easier to run several different instances of
    TBB at the same time. Resolves bug 3077.
  o Provide the necessary fields (Control password, ControlPort) to let     TorButton NEWNYM. Vidalia provides these in env vars when it launches
    the Firefox instance. Resolves bug 2659.

Hi tagnaq,
There isn't such documentation yet. It's part of my TODO list.
For now, all I can offer you is to join  and I'll answer your
questions or explain how to understand Vidalia's settings from the code.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia 0.3.0-alpha is out 
Hello everyone,
Vidalia-0.3.0-alpha is out!
We are going to be doing a series of alpha releases in parallel with the
stable 0.2.x to have a wider audience for some changes that are kind of
"core" for Vidalia, or they are really big to put them on the stable
before testing them for a while.
We need more eyes, but I want to be clear about the "alpha" part in the
version. The bundles that were just announced they also have an alpha
version of Tor, the latest libevent, the latest openssl, and so on, not
just this Vidalia release. So be aware of this while running them.
Here's the changelog:
0.3.0   06-May-2011
  o Vidalia has got a new GUI. Instead of separate dialogs, each
    functionality is organized in tabs arranged in a common main window.
    This new tab organization will give Vidalia a generic way of
    organizing the GUI plug-ins that will be available in later
    releases.  Resolves bug 2939.
  o When a Tor instance is already running and Vidalia doesn't know the
    control password, don't ask for the it but rather explain the
    situation and display the few possible choices the user has.
    Resolves bug 2132.
  o Add an option for setting up a non-exit relay to the Sharing
    configuration panel. This is meant to clarify what an exit policy
    and an exit relay are.  Resolves bug 2644.
  o Add a way to reload Tor's configuration without having to stop it.
    Tor can reload its configuration while it is running, Vidalia now
    provides a menu option for that, so, for example, relay operators
    won't be affected by the fact that their relay was down for a while.
    Resolves bug 2724.
  o Reintegrate Breakpad, and make available in other platforms other
    than Windows. Resolves bug 2105.
  o Fix bandwidth assigned to relays on the Network Map. A lot of relays
    are displaying an erroneous bandwidth and since they are ordered by
    that value in the Network Map, it leads to confusion. Vidalia now
    specifies the bandwidth as the minimum of the three possible values
    (burst, average and observed). Fixes bug 2744.
  o Minor change to the checkbox for starting Tor when Vidalia starts.
    It was suggested that the way the phrasing was done was missleading.
    Resolves bug 2806.
  o Add a way to bootstrap Tor's torrc file (copy the torrc to a given
    directory before Vidalia starts) so that packages such as
    Bridge-by-default portable bundles for OSX don't violate the
    directory structure of the operative system. Fixes bug 2821.
  o Add the proper CA Certificates so that the "Find Bridges" button
    works again. Fixes bug 2835.
  o Update the useful links help page. Fixes bug 2809.

That is how I use it, yes. Although I still don't understand exactly
what "manually connecting" means.
Also, I don't think the two outputs you pasted aren't really usefull
since one is on notice and the other on debug. What you describe sounds strange, since the actual link between the
start button and the functionality didn't change, just the button
position. If you keep experimenting this problem, could you please file
a ticket with the steps to reproduce it?
