Btw, about policy,
I'm curious what will happen if highly popular(equivalent web site has
dedicated server and utilize it) hidden service will be created. Could Tor
network carry such load?
(if site content for download is rather small files,less than Mb in general)

I think it's potentially possible to DDoS hidden service if it's dynamic
site and simple cannot server ENOUGH requests per second
(i.e. overload number of apache processes,etc)
of course sometimes it's possible to place hidden service on EC2 with
load-balacing and nodes autostartup on demand but it's costly...
Also issue of hidden service keeping A LOT of connections open - is someone
checked how this work will?
Is there any statistic on any even remotely popular hidden services

@_subject: is my server config sane? 
Hi,Want to 'play a little' with Tor for several reasons:
- I think I need hidden services (which currently won't be widely used and
won't be in public directories)
I have real IP so I currently configured server as:
RelayBandwidthRate 60 Kbytes
Relay...Burst 70 KBytes
MaximumAdvertisedBandwith 20 KBytes
Default exit policy for now
(I'm on 1 Megabit(both up and down) ADSL and want to have space for other
things too,both via my usage of Tor and non-Tor traffic).
Is this sane configuration?Is it possible to configure Tor so
relay/exit-node will eat for example 70 KBytes/s but if there is local
request-it's got a priority?
There is some traffic via exit node but sometimes there are problem that I
could not reach my own hidden servers for several hours after Tor server
restart, anyone know why this can be?Rendevuz descriptors must travel to all
p.s.Tor 0.2.0.30 r15956 on Linux i686

2009/10/23 Yes it is.
You could limit it's usage to (almost) zero if you ONLY allow ports 80 and
(Bittorrent clients _usually_ use other random ports for communication)
