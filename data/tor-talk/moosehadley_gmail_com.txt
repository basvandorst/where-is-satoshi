@_subject: [tor-talk] Mute a particular thread 
Is there a way to mute or unsubscribe from a particular thread without
unsubscribing from the entire mailing list?
Sorry, I'm not very experienced with GNU Mailman.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Two Questions about the TBB. 
I can answer the first question, but I can't say for sure on the second.
No, the Tor Browser does not use any blacklists of any kind. Sure, anti-phishing and anti-malware warnings can have great value to an inexperienced user.
However, they are a direct form of "good censorship".
As we've seen in some cases, any form of "good censorship" can be easily turned to "bad censorship" when control of a blacklist falls into the hands of someone without the users best interests in mind.
Because of this, the Tor Browser Bundle does not support these or any other filters.

If anything happened at all.
Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but this sounds very much like what happened to Assange.
It's possible that all the allegations are true.
It's possible that an organization (maybe government) wants to destroy his reputation to discredit him.
And we'll never know 100%.
Whatever the case may be, I think gossip and speculation on the personal life of a former member is a little too off-topic, and the kind of thing that makes people take sides and tear communities apart.

The impersonation vulnerability mentioned here is inherent; it requires compromising the victims system to steal their private key, or using brute-force.

Ahh, yes. Thank you for pointing that out.
Would you mind if I took the liberty to submit your findings to the
TorChat bug tracker for formal review?

Would it be feasible for a future release of meek to do this automatically?
Just cycle through subdomains till one works?
Google has quite a few subdomains...
[www, mail, images, news, video, books, picasaweb, groups, clients1,
docs, translate, earth, spreadsheets, ap, toolbar, partnerpage].google.com
That's not even a quarter of them.

I think a few did back in the late 1990's
Today, that sort of thing is kinda insane.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor entry and exit nodes 
Tor uses three nodes between the user and the destination. Each node only knows the IP of the point before it and the point after it.
For example, the entry node only knows the IP of the user and the middle node. The middle node only knows the IP of the entry node and the exit node. The exit node only knows the IP of the middle node and the destination.
An adversary would need control of all three nodes to be 100% certain of who the user is and what the final destination is.
If an adversary only controlled the exit or the entry node, they could make an educated guess by watching the amount of traffic leaving the user and arriving at the destination; but it would be impossible (or extremely difficult) to do this without extensive preparations beforehand.

The relay list isn't a secret at all, in fact you can view it here:
And sure, if you have a list of relays and you have a backdoor into the
ISPs, of course you can get a list of everyone who's ever connected to them.
That's why we take important steps to insurance privacy like using three
