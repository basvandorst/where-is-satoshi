I see this in no Tor MLs. What's the status with this issue?

Maybe Windows Security is blocking it for whatever reason. Probably a false positive. Try adding TBB as an exclusion by going Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security. Then under Virus & threat protection settings click on Manage settings. Under Exclusions  select Add or remove exclusions. Now select the proper folders or process or anything.
