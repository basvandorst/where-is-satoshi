@_subject: [tor-talk] I2P over Tor 
Newbie I2P contributor here, I've recently been playing around with the idea of running I2P over Tor for purely experimental reasons. I am thinking that some users could still participate in routing traffic by providing a reachable hidden service address and optionally a publicly reachable clearnet address. I am pretty sure that Tor can handle a few small I2P routers but I would like to make sure that it will not bother the Tor network. I am unsure of how much bandwidth it would use, in the long run it may use a lot if people like the idea of I2P over/inside tor. Would this bother Tor if this was a) done on an experimental level, b) done as an optional mode of operation for i2p, c) default for i2p.
case A is almost ready to go
case B is a possible possibility for the future
case C will never happen ever. Regardless, I'd like to hear thoughts on such systems for possible future ventures.
