But that requires I trust the first node. Since the crypto starts between the attacker and my node, the attacker can decrypt my data, assuming that it can fool me into thinking it did extend operations.
But if it is truly impossible (speaking in a cryptographic and code integrity sense) for a node to do a phony extend request, then I accept your answer.
So now my question is now this. How can nodes, at any hop, not fool me into thinking they did extend operations when they really did not? Does does my node have public key knowledge of ALL possible nodes it can route through?

That answers my question. So any attack approaching my scenario would thus require that enough of these nodes have fooled whomever we trust to publish the master list of permanent nodes. Or, in simpler terms, not

Tools which are used for good can also be used for bad, and you just hope the good uses out weigh the bad ones.
But even if tor were to be mostly for evil deeds (and we really have no way to determine if it is), I still applaud any mechanism that gives the common user a level of privacy that can hopefully compete with We've already seen how satellite communications plus the internet have weakened the ability of authoritative regimes to control what information their subjects are able to access, however they do so with risk.  Allowing oppressed people to speak and request information freely would have even a greater impact.
Ultimately, I guess it's about balance of power.  Anything to help keep the authorities in check.

How about prioritizing certain services over others?  Perhaps the bucket scheme used for bandwidth throttling could also consider the destination

@_subject: tor won't run for more than a few minutes 
Was running tor-0.0.9.2 successfully for days at a time until it started crashing.  Upgraded to 0.0.9.3, but it is having the same problem.  Did somebody figure out a ping of death to circulate around the network?

Your point being the strength of the anonymity depends on the number of nodes. If there were, say, 2000 nodes, then one would have to create almost 8 billion connections. It is encouraging to know the level of effectiveness increases geometrically with the number of new nodes

What if a hostile _first_ node from your node were to pretend to honor your extend requests and complete the connection to the exit point, yet capture everything that happens? Such a node would be able to determine that it is the first hop from a particular connection because it would be able to see clear text data. I know the data between nodes is encrypted, but if you are the first node then you have knowledge of what the encrypted data is. While it pretends to honor extend requests and handshake new keys, it's actually doing so with itself so that it can see the entire circuit.
If I understand the design document, data isn't spread out across different nodes so that each node doesn't have the complete data. Doing so would strengthen tor against such an attack. Some scrambling mechanism so that each group of bytes need to be put back together with complimentary information routed through other nodes. This way, ALL the nodes from the node under attack would have to be under control by the same attacker.
Since intermediate tor nodes have key pairs signed with their ip information which prevent subverting connections to hostile nodes, I see that it would be extremely difficult to run one master hostile node and divert all traffic to it from a node (or ISP or country) being attacked.
