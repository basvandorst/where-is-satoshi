Hi Eugen,
Can you expand on why you think using anonymous remailers will fail to
deliver messages?  Judging by the current stats the Mixmaster Remailer
network appears highly reliable.
The major limitation of Mixmaster remailers are that they only provide
anonymous, not pseudonymous (two way) communication.  If users can
live with this constraint then remailers offer the best solution for
anonymous email and Usenet posting.
