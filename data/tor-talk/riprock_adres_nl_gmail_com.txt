@_subject: New wiki 
I'd like to know if anyone can see nontrivial content at that link.
I'm getting nothing but 503 privoxy errors from the following links:
I suspect it's possible that these have content visible to the person
creating them but not to anyone else.
So if anyone else is able to read something at those, please tell me and
I'll see if I can't track down the problem.

@_subject: is this a bandwidth problem? my IP is a TOR exit, the client works and the server doesn't 
So  verifies that my TOR setup really is
working, and it shows IPs and machine names that have nothing to do with my
real IP and machine name.  That much is great.  However, when I try surfing
to .onion URLs, I get 503 or 404 errors, along with the not-very-encouraging
message that my request "could not be fulfilled, because the domain name *...
*could not be resolved....This is often a temporary failure, so you might
just try again."
I'm using Vidalia/Privoxy/Firefox/Torbutton and I usually don't run a
server.   And it's great for going to normal webpages but telling them some
other IP.
I tried running a server to see if that would improve matters, but possibly
my bandwidth is too low (I'm just on a home ADSL account).

I think the problem might be a lack of bandwidth.
I don't believe I have a firewall problem.
I imagine the worst-case scenario is that I'll be unable to resolve any
.onion URLs until I buy a huge amount of bandwidth, set up a dedicated TOR
server, and thus get enough traffic to be thoroughly connected.  In other
words, I fear that I might have to set up a miniature ISP in order to get
any .onion connections.
Is there any way to troubleshoot this, short of setting up a miniature ISP?

@_subject: is this a bandwidth problem? my IP is a TOR exit, the client works and the server doesn't 
Okay, the problem is my ports.  And  because my logs had lacked the error
messages described by Fabian, I guess I have socks4 where I ought to have
socks4a, although
I had thought that I had socks4a because my Privoxy config file has the
forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
But of course the little dot prevents the forwarding from being used.  So I
tried taking out the "." and LittleSnitch reported that Privoxy was now
trying to access the net when I tried to find the hidden service.
I now see that there is an error:
Jul 22 23:53:09:137 [Notice] Rend stream is 120 seconds late. Giving up on
ss '[scrubbed].onion'.
Now, the fact that I have that would lead me to think I have socks4a, but "
example.noconnect" leads to an identical error page, so maybe I don't have
socks4a, or maybe some other thing is going wrong with the 9050 mentioned in
the file and the 8118 mentioned on the error page.
Let me rephrase that.  The problem exists whether my firewall is on or off,
and it exists whether I activate or deactivate my "Little Snitch" program.
That address opens immediately with the message:
The hidden wiki is gone. If you set up a new one and post the link to the
or-talk list I'll link it from here. 06/07/07.
Some Hans Zaagman suggested in a post to
or-talkto use
 as a replacement. 07/07/07.
The problem comes when I try to open
which always takes at least 30 seconds, usually much longer, and results in
a  404 error.
If not, does it fail immediately (meaning you might not have configured
It takes about a minute or two to fail, never more than five minutes.  Thus
I think my network is too slow, thus I wondered if more bandwidth might be
So anyway I went into the config file of Privoxy and added the following
below the forward socks4a:
forward-socks4a / localhost:9050
forward-socks4a / localhost:8118
forward         192.168.*.*/
forward         10.*.*.*/
forward         127.*.*.*/
This was inspired by reading the faq/configuration file.  However, neither
the new hidden wiki, nor example.noconnect, show any new behaviors -- they
both show the same error page, except for the URL.
So I guess I am going to build the 3.0.7 version of Privoxy from source to
see newer and more interesting error messages.
Thanks for the hints so far.
Thanks in advance for any further advice.

I was shocked, and a little embarrassed, to see that
initially reported that I had errors because I had taken out the dots.
I had not bothered to check it again after taking out the dots in the
I must have gotten it working briefly by initially leaving the "."s in, then
I messed it up soon after that by taking them out.  I put the dots back in
to the config file and suddenly the
page stopped showing the errors.
Thanks to everyone for  helping with this.

I can't get it to load anything but a "503" error. It says I should try
again, but a large number of tries have yielded nothing so far.
I get very similar pages from:
