@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-Arm Menu Key? 
Hello guys,
I just installed Tor-Arm on debian; of which I have used many times before
and love the project. (
I cannot recall what the key is to access the menu interface.  Can anyone
tell me?

Hi Damian,
Yes I thought this was the case.  I downloaded the Python source version on
the Arm website and installed it on my system, as is normally the case.
The package in apt debian-back ports must be an old version because it does
not contain the menu key. (apt-get install tor-arm)

I am pretty sure this is not relevant,
But can someone tell me what the HttpProxy does in torrc?  Will this
forward outgoing traffic through a proxy server if it is defined for an
exit relay on others traffic?

Why can't there be some manner of anonymity such as remote VNCing to a
remote computer (say a web server desktop on Gnome running on an Amazon AWS
This way your true identity is an Amazon AWS cloud IP and say you are ssh
tunneled or connected via tor to it --- and running Firefox remotely on the
vnc desktop.
There are too many vulnerabilities to just have a browser be secure; IMO it
really needs to be the entire physical system?

"It's easy for lots of applications to bypass the proxy settings in the
browser, the operating system, and in some cases, the network."
Very well put -- especially the last 6 words!

Hi Joe,
Great questions.  I was also wondering how these claims on the New Identity
button works in this case.
If it is the case, which it may be, this seems to or would seem to exceed
my expectations just as it may yours.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pittsburgh Bombing Threats and Mix-Master 
I just heard that the University of Pittsburgh's bomb threats had been sent
in via Mixmaster.  I had never heard of this project until tonight and it
instantly lead me to think of Tor.
I had tried using Mixmaster myself but it rejects mail due to an unknown
source address (eg root at localhost) -- So I was wondering of tracking
capability of Mixmaster.  Is it traceable?  I may not have my postfix setup
My last question could this work *with* tor, in combination?

Yeah, There honestly seemed to be too few and far too static remail relay
servers to be highly anonymous; what if you go through only 3 and hack the
out box, to the previous, to the first, back to the original sender?

What is the HttpProxy configuration directive for in torrc?
What if I am an exit relay and I have:
HttpProxy 127.0.0.1:3128
(a Squid proxy running locally) -- Do outgoing connections process through
Squid then?
