@_subject: Gsoc Ideas 
I'm Li Dong and I study at Graduate University of Chinese Academy of
Sciences. I'm considering applying for project "*Tor Controller Status Event
Interface*" .
*Tor Controller Status Event Interface*
I had done some UI development with Qt in a project, and I had read most of
the Vidalia source code. So I think I may do this job well.
Approach: put a little blinking badge on Vidalia's tray icon that alerts the
user to new status events they should look at.
1 develop the UI part of a dialog to show recent status event to the users;
develop the slot to handle the status changing signals emitted by tor.
2 list the events and possible operation options and tips; this part may be
implemented in two ways: one is that tips are provided as signal parameters
by tor process; the other is to create a table to map the events to
3 according to the operations chosen by the user, emit proper signals to tor
What do you think of my approach?
Thanks ahead for replying,
Li Dong
