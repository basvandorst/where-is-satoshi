@_subject: [tor-talk] ISP CenturyLink Blocking Tor? 
I have had CenturyLink phone service for over 28 years.  I had their DSL for much of that time but I ended up suing them for not delivering on our basic contracted plan.  Century Link is nearly impossible to contact.  I took me 2 years of phone calls and on-line forms to get caller ID.  If anyone can penetrate their personnel firewall, please disclose to this group.  In most on my dealings, CenturyLink was too under-employed to respond to my requests.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service Hosting (Free experimental, offer) 
I'm interested but a slow mover.  Work sometimes gets in my way.  I am putting together pages for a hidden site but I don't think I can be ready to put it on line til month's end.  It will be a legal site everywhere.  This is a wonderful offer Thomas.  Hope someone takes you up on it.

Buy him a beer if you see him.

@_subject: [tor-talk] unbound DNS caching 
I've recently tried unbound for a number of business servers.  It works well for me.  I thought I would try using it with one of my Tor VPS exit relays  (DDC6 C968 B3DF D156 C97F D718 0875 8D25 1B66 DBB2).  However, looking at the unbound log I see my test activity with "drill" and "dig" but I don't see any request activity from Tor.  Nothing else runs on the I found lots of references to tor and unbound on the internet but all were unsatisfactory to my question.
Has anyone solved this and posted information?  Thanks for the help, all.
