I mentioned this problem a month or so ago, and Peter Palfrader suggested:
     Try 0.1.1.x, it's a bit more aggressive with retries.
That's the development release, and it worked for me.

Your settings look right, but if you remove the forward-socks4a line
from your privoxy config, does it work then?
What this does is only run your clients through privoxy and straight
onto the Internet. This way, you can determine if you've got the
client-to-privoxy-to-internet chain working. Later, you can add the
forward-socks4a line back in to see if privoxy is talking to the Tor
server properly.

@_subject: Tor limitation 
I'm in Beijing and I'm happy that Tor is there when I need it. In
fact, en.wikipedia.org is now blocked by my ISP, so Tor is almost
essential. But yes, it's pretty slow, though I'm patient. Only lately,
I'm consistently getting DNS lookup failures, and that's what's mostly
eroding my experience of using Tor all the time. (I know I should
change the config of my client to give more logging info so I can
track down this bad exit node, but I haven't made the effort yet.)

The organization that monitors Internet filtering in countries around
the world, including China, is the Open Net Initiative:
With regards to having a Tor exit node in China, I think many Tor
users would hate it, depending on their surfing habits---too many
sites and IP addresses are blocked. Besides, users in China such as
myself can only access Tor because the government hasn't blocked it
yet. I mean, the list of entry nodes is public (it has to be) so
blocking those IP addresses is trivial. I am hoping that Tor continues
to fall under their radar.
And thanks for the advice on upgrading to the experimental version of
Tor. I have upgraded now, and I will test its performance. Thanks!
