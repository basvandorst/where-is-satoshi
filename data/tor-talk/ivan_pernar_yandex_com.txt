@_subject: [tor-talk] Creation of TOR Linux distribution for relay or server 
I'm Linux user and I attempted to set up TOR relay or server but I'm too unexperianced to do that.
I tried to youtube to learn but as much as I understand, since end of Vidalia, there is no simple (graphical) way to set it up.
So, as an end user I came up to a fairly simple solution that would in the same time remove insecurity (Windows machines as nods) and in the same time simplify setting up Tor reley or server.
And that is following.
Creation of TOR Linux distribution for relay or server with everything preconfigured
For example, i run unconfigured Ubuntu, If I want to be a reley or server I just go to VirtualBox, start Virtualmachine - Tor Linux distribution for reley or server and bring up TOR reley or server with a click of a mouse. I need not to configure anything becaouse distribution has all precofigured, I just need to make it running.
On that way (with VirtualBox), you could run Linux Tor server or reley even within Windows machine.
What is your view on that issue? Do you think it would be to complicated to create such distribution?
All the best and good luck!
