I want do some programming with Tor, I've heared that Tor is developed on Linux platform, so I want to switch my OS to Linux. But since Linux has so many variations, I don't know which one should I install for programming Tor?

First. It is completely impossible for Chinese government to setup
censorship system out of its territory, especially in a democratic country.
If they were to do this, it would not only be against the law of country in
which their censor system located, but also seriously destroy their
Second. Even if such nodes exist, only they act as exit node can the censor
system works. Even in this situation, they still cannot trace back the
original user who breaks the censor rule since tor has so many relays.

I've been thinking about the recent threads involving our recent
contributor from China, and the idea of excluding nodes by country - in
this case, excluding Chinese nodes, for the purposes of circumventing
the Great Firewall.
However, such an approach relies on the ability to tie an IP address to
geography. This led me to something that while simple, could break this
entire approach:
What if the Chinese government were to open virtual server accounts in
other countries? Assuming they had massive connectivity (which some
locations do - there's such a place near me, which hosts among other
things, Google), malicious Tor nodes could be run on them.
Since excluding by geography would be useless, they'd only need to sit
back and wait.
Any thoughts?

@_subject: One hop proxy [Re: Can nickname be duplicate?] 
I do not mean to reduce tor to one-hop proxy. There is trade-off between speed and anonymous-preserving. For different user groups have different requirement of safety and anonymous, even one user's needs vary from different conditions he counters, sometimes he prefers speed and sometimes he needs more safety. My opinion is that to let people use their Tor more freely, for example, they can free to choose number of hops, they can choose a fixed exit node if they trust it, or they can let their Tor to choose path ramdomly or they specify a path they consider as reliable.

Why tor is banned in Finland? it's just unimaginable!!!
I am from China, where internet censorship is used by the government.
So we use tor to avoid censorship from the government.
But so far as I know, there is no internet censorship in Finland, I donot know if I am right?
If not for avoiding censorhip, why do you use tor? The Police should not have interrupted you if you had not done illeagal operate such as sending junk mails with tor....

@_subject: How to remove some useless nodes 
We in China use tor mainly for avoiding Great Fire Wall, which is a very strong internet censorship software operated by the government. So, if linkage with nodes within China is completely useless for us to break the censorship. Usually, we can cut off such connection in tor's graphic window vidalia manually, but it very bothering, we must keep an eye on whether there is linkage within China. I wonder if there is some way to remove nodes located in China.
If someone knows how to do, plz tell me, Thanks!!!

Inspired by the principle of tor, we intend to develop a distributed data base which could maintain privacy preserving.
But I still have some questions about how does tor work, especially how does it encrypt my data?
We know that there is an entrance node and an exit node in a path, cleartext is sent out from the exit node to the destination that we are aimed at. If so, my original cleartext could be revealed to the exit node? If my data is encrypted on my PC by the tor I runned, how does the exit node decrypt the ciphered text? How does it get the decrypt key?
Another question is what kind of cryptology algorithm tor uses, RSA? or others?
Thank you very much for replying!!!

@_subject: Can nickname be duplicate? 
Does Tor identify each node by its nickname? for example, in torrc, a series
of commands such as:
ExcludeNodes nickname,nickname,... EntryNodes nickname,nickname,... ExitNodes nickname,nickname,... But when we see at  (sorted by their names) we
can find a bundle of nodes with the same nickname "unnamed", see following:
If I want to remove a node located in China whose nickname also is
"unnamed", I just add "ExcludeNodes unnamed" to torrc. How does tor know
which node I want to remove, perhaps, it removes a node in Europe which I
want to keep.
Can anyone explain why?

If just for visiting those banned website by local ISP, not too strong
anonymous preserving is required.
Censor systems is not very high-tech, it adopt mainly two method: first,
domain (or IP address) deny, that is to cut off the connection when your
HTTP require bound to those banned websites' IP which is listed in ISP's
server; second: "key-words" filter, ISPs keep a set of "key-words" mainly
refer to pornographic, political related subject; when any data stream that
contains these key-words pass through ISP, it will be cut off. Seriously, it
will reveal your IP to the ISP.
Before tor is available, people often used proxy located abroad their own
country to visit banned sites, but this was a unstable way, such proxy
server was hard to find, once one of these proxy become well-known, it would
soon be listed on the banned IP list of censor system. Furthermore, it
cannot avoid "key-words" filter if data streamed from client to proxy (or
vice-versa) is not encrypted.
The solution is a proxy without fixed IP and can also encrypt data, Tor is a
good tool! But we just need such a proxy, thus so many relays is not needed,
and such relays will slow down the speed of communication.
So, my idea is to find a way to get rid of relays, what I need is just exit
nodes abroad my country and other totalitarian governed regions, I've found
that generally one circuit contains three nodes when tor is used to browse
website, that is to say my data is encrypted for three times. In fact, to
me, one exit node with a high bandwidth abroad is enough.
Of course what I have said above does not necessarily fit every country. In
my country, as long as you do not spread out those banned information, the
police would not bother you just for the reason that you browse them
personally. To secure your safety, you must be familiar with the law in your
country and adopt according safety secure strategy.
If anyone knows how to do, please help me. Thanks!

@_subject: What does "bandwidth" mean in cached-routers? 
When looking at network maps in Vidalia, we can see the bandwidth of the router denoted as "1286KB/s". But when looking up corresponding records in the "cached-routers" located in tor data directory, it reads in the form of "bandwidth 1024000 2048000 1316902". What does it mean? Does it have any relation with "1286KB/s"?
Another question about the bandwidth of circuits: I see routers in a circuit having different bandwidth, from xxKB/s to xxxxKB/s. Is the bandwidth of the circuit as a whole determined by the router with the lowest bandwidth? For example: a circuit containing 3 nodes whose bandwidth are 4328, 4317, 327KB/s respectively. Can we say that the bandwidth of this circuit is 327KB/s?
By adding "ExcludeNodes" to torrc to remove low-bandwidth routers, can we speed up tor?
