@_subject: Tor as a component of a cohesive anonymizing OS 
Sure, I do this with Debian, one privoxy talks to tor, the other doesn't. I
duplicated the /etc/init.d/ control script, diff as follows:
pipe:init.d/$ diff privoxy privoxy-tor
< NAME=privoxy
< CONFIGFILE=/etc/privoxy/config
Then there are the two config files, diff:
pipe:privoxy/$ diff config config-tor
< logdir /var/log/privoxy
< listen-address  127.0.0.1:8118
< # sasho:
<  / localhost:9050 .
Hope it helps

@_subject: squid - privoxy - tor problem 
I added a line to the squid.conf at the Wiki which forces squid to always use the parent proxy (privoxy). Squid does fail if privoxy/tor is not available.
