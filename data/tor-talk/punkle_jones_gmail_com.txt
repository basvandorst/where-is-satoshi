Google could absolutely do this in a reduced-bandwidth fashion: allow tor
freely, track anonymity trending, develop non-free tools based on said
trends at google labs, sell them back to you, and profit.  Google
Semi-AnonyDesktop.  Yuck.

Unlurking for the first time, I think.
Why not join forces with a popular freeware/shareware product like Aim or
Winamp, with an "uncheck to opt out" option and a description of tor.  Such
a bundle could be preset to relay, and there's got to be a magic bandwidth
that most western users could tolerate.  Is it ethically wrong to insert TOR
into the userspace of the less-informed by associating it with a popular
(hopefully not unsavory) download?  Does this concept fly in the face of
free will?  Is it just too sneaky?  It's not like you'd be putting five new
toolbars into their browser.

with the motivation provided up front and not during an installation..  Just
because it's installed doesn't mean it has to be used.  I imagined a
good-faith service that someone runs because they feel it benefits everyone
without necessarily needing it themselves.  The sketchy part is getting
folks to run another thing on their computer to help other folks out.
Unless a ton of new tor installations would be a burden instead of a boon.

@_subject: US Seeks Access to More Internet Data Without Court Order 
It's time, finally, for every website to start supporting SSL.  What reasons
are there not to support it nowadays?
Unless there are bad folks out there actively matching entries to exits and
making the info available to your ISP/the guys in suits (there's no reason
to entirely doubt this possibility - why not be paranoid?), there won't be a
whole heck of a lot of info if you're using TOR.  The standard warnings
still apply:  This is a very deep topic that IMO goes far beyond simply using TOR and
stopping conspicuous behaviors to stymie tracking.  I'm no expert on
breaking anonymity, so hopefully some of those will chime in.  Kyle
Williams, or coderman maybe?

Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not watching you.

NoScript may also have flash objects disabled by default (check settings).

Firefox w/o Tor network?
Language barrier fail.  The tor video in question is in ogg format, so
unless I'm mistaken it doesn't require flash.  It should be natively
supported in Firefox.
