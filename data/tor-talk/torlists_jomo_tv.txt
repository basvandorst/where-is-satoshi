@_subject: [tor-talk] Privacy considerations when copy/pasting images 
When you copy an image from a Website, Firefox copies the  element
and all its attributes, which might leak some sensitive data. I recently
filed this bug for Firefox:
 which I believe
might be interesting for Tor users/developers to follow, and perhaps
implement for Tor if Mozilla decides not to.
