@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor to VPN to Internet = Bad. Why? 
Recently, I'd come across some chatter that suggested that connecting to a VPN via TOR was not a good idea and, rather, the better idea was to connect to a VPN that then used Tor.  I've not found any articles on the net that really discuss this issue.  My concern stems from more of a curiosity due to an encrypted private web proxy I used to run for foreign activists.  While the proxy would have appeared entirely benign to anyone in their regime, a number used Tor to connect to it. My larger question is, if there is a security concern for using Tor to connect to a VPN which then connects to the internet, would the same concerns apply to people who use Tor to connect to an encrypted web proxy?  Thanks in advance for any replies.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Help users in Iran reach the internet 
I'm running into an issue involving obfsproxy.  I've followed the instructions provided by Jacob.  From a friend's machine at a different IP address, if I use Vidalia and point the bridge and the ORPort at 9001, it works without any issues.  However, if I point the bridge to the port setup by obfsproxy, I run into the following problem with Vidalia:
"Establishing an encrypted directory connection failed (done)."
When running Tor with the logging set to "debug" on my bridge, I've come across the following which I believe to be the culprit:
"Feb 12 13:06:36.000 [debug] tor_tls_handshake(): About to call SSL_accept on 0x7f51fda2ca80 (unknown state)
Feb 12 13:06:36.000 [info] TLS error: unexpected close while handshaking (unknown state)
Feb 12 13:06:36.000 [info] connection_tls_continue_handshake(): tls error [unexpected close]. breaking connection."
Am I missing a particular package?  Has anyone else run into this problem?

Hey, all.  I put together a quick how to guide based off of some of the resources posted here, and various others on the net, to try and make it easier for the less experienced to get an obfuscated Tor Bridge running for Iran.  It can be found at  at the moment.  If anyone thinks it needs any tweaks, or if anyone would like to use it, expand upon it, or pass it around, please feel free.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Obfsproxy Documentation/Help? 
I'm having trouble coming across documentation for the possible arguments that can be used with Obfsproxy.  My question specifically is whether or not there is a way to open Obfsproxy on a specific port via the ServerTransportPlugin call in the torrc file?  The reason I ask is because sometimes I need to bounce into Windows 7 for various multimedia creation.  I'd like to keep the same IP address and port that I sent to those maintaining the secret list of bridges, since I've already seen activity in my logs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia & Obsfproxy Bundle? 
Does anyone know if such a bundle exists or if there are plans to make one?  The reason I ask is because I know a number of people who would be down to run an Obfuscated Tor Bridge, but are a bit wary of installing Linux as they've either never used it, or are still dependent on a number of programs they use in either Windows or OS X. I managed to get such a set up working just fine via tweaking the Tor Browser Bundle that comes packaged with Obsfproxy.  I was thinking about writing up a quick "how to" guide for that approach on either Windows or OS X.  But, if such a standalone Vidalia bundle exists, it would weed out a couple steps (pretty much editing some text and repointing Vidalia to various programs and config files) that would make the instructions simpler for someone who isn't necessarily 100% comfortable with Tor or setting up something like it.

A lot of sites are incredibly "broken" if javascript is disabled.  NoScript would be one example of a "privacy plugin" that would thus cause a problem if enabled for some sites.  It's why I'm curious as to what the plugin was that you were using.  I haven't been using ixquick for very long, and still don't use it regularly.  It's one I started messing with scroogle was not always accessible to me for whatever reasons.  Having browsed the site with Mozilla Firefox + Noscript (scripting disabled) + Ghostery + AdBlock Plus + HTTPS Everywhere, + Cookies disabled, in addition to browsing the site via the Tor Browser Bundle + Noscript (scripting disabled) + HTTPS Everywhere + Cookies disabaled, and never having run into the message you describe, I'm curious to reproduce it.

Due to the way in which you've been acting, you are no more trustworthy than a fly-by-night website with a .cc domain.  Generally, when you make a claim that you've come across a problem, it's your duty to tell people how to reproduce it if you want people to take you seriously.  Since you can't be bothered to do that, why should any take you seriously? Interesting.  Ixquick.com has only been part of the "Tor Button" plugin in TBB for while now as one of the alternatives you can check off when hit with a Google CAPTCHA.
Then why are you even on this list?  Seriously, if you're so paranoid about your identity, to the point that you think telling us what plugins you use may result in your security getting compromised by one of us, why would you even bother participating here?  You could just point your Tor Browser to the list archive and lurk away without even being subscribed.
Nope.  But, at this point, given your childish rantings, accusations and cursing in your last e-mail, I wouldn't be surprised if you told me "LAMER" was there. :P
Anyways, enjoy your tirades and future flamebait or trolling.  I won't be tossing you any treats in the future.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Updated Instructions to Install Obfsproxy Bridge on 
I've updated the previous detailed Linux instructions in the Wiki to include a section that describes how to tweak the TBB with Obfsproxy to run as an Obfuscated Tor Bridge.  As a result,I removed the instructions on installing Linux via Wubi.
I was planning on adding a section for OS X as well.  Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to a Mac running OS X 10.6 or 10.7.  Thus, I could not run the TBB bundle with Obfsproxy that currently exists.  When I get access to such a machine, I will update the directions.  However, if someone already has a Mac running that OS, and would like to provide instructions on setting up a dedicated Tor Bridge via the OS X TBB bundle, please feel free to do so.  The Wiki entry was created with the Cypherpunks account, so it is editable by all.  Here is the link:

This isn't a bad idea.? Or, more specifically, why not use the existing javascript/no javascript routines in HTML on check.torproject.org to warn users of possible security ramifications from having javascript enabled?? That might be the easiest method to continue packaging the Tor Browser Bundle as currently done without dealing with any negative feedback claiming that people are uninformed of the risks possible through javascript exploits and, thus, are left insecure by default.

Thank you.? I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this allegation is unfounded.? Non-techies have been using e-mail lists for decades.? The most clueless computer users in my college who used AOL for practically everything still somehow managed to subscribe to majordomo lists through pine from a shell prompt.? Subscribing to this list is easy compared to that method.? Now, of course there is something to be said for "non-techies" choosing not to use e-mail lists due to the abundance and availability of services like Facebook or Google+.? Those services are promoted better.? But, the claim that the same people signing up to those services, which require an e-mail account in order to sign up for them, couldn't sign up to this list does not appear to be supportable in the slightest. For the reasons others have stated, I prefer e-mail as well.? Forums are a pain to navigate compared to e-mail.? They simply become too fractured.? I also got to see the implementation of one e-mail list that attempted switching over to a web forum while integrating the list into the forum.? People could make posts or reply to the list and it would also show up on the forum.? While a novel idea at the time, and I unfortunately have no recollection of what the software was named, it was an ugly mess in implementation and was abandoned in fairly short order.

Both my parents are grandparents and would qualify as technologically inept.? These are people who have called for help connecting to the net only to discover that, in order for that to happen, they needed to have their DSL modem powered on. ;)? Both have subscribed to lists for personal interests over the years.? In the 90s, I'd be more sympathetic to the Grandma Test.? But, with today's incarnation of the net, which is entirely point and click driven for common users, it's not an issue.? If someone figured out how to sign up to Facebook, they can figure out how to sign up to an e-mail list.
I've just yet to see a very elegant way to merge them.? The closest I've seen is Sympa.? Perhaps take a look at that?? It's a mailing list service where the archives can be used and accessed like a forum.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor's reputation problem with pedo, 
The New Yorker just helped out for some positive PR surrounding hidden services.? Last Monday, they implemented "strongbox."? It's a means of sending the New Yorker tips and information without fear of reprisal, since not even the New Yorker can know who someone is as a result of IP address logs. The fundamental tech driving that at the core is Tor's hidden services.
Sorry to resurrect an old discussion.? But, this thread came to mind as I was reading about Strongbox this week.? With a main stream publication like the New Yorker using Tor's hidden services in order to result in public good, this is a very good piece of PR for Tor that should be emphasized.? Here are some links.

Hi Chris,
I agree with you. Part of what we have done a poor job communicating
is that hidden services are a tiny fraction of overall Tor use. The
wikipedia article on Tor is mostly written by hidden service enthusiasts
(as far as I can tell), which further misleads people.

To the uninformed, Tor can conjure up the image of criminals or other scary boogeymen, especially if someone desires to push the discussion in such a direction.? That's why I posted this example of the New Yorker's system.? It's a real world example of a long and well known entity that doesn't exist on the fringe taking full advantage of what is offered by Tor's hidden services. For PR purposes, it's great because it is something they can be shown.? It provides a very good escape from the hypothetical or philosophical games that people play that speculate on both the "evil" and "good" uses of Tor.? Plenty of us have been playing that game for years where we try to mention the good people do with Tor's hidden services.? But, for those who have never even used Tor, it's hard for them to comprehend.? Now there is a very tangible and accessible example they can see.? Thus, it's good PR, especially when someone wants to talk about illegal pornography
 on which there is no true metric.

Except I think that in this case Tor is a bit more like a gun than a screw
driver. The good purposes aren't always obvious and the nefarious purposes
are on the forefront of public attention a lot more. It's not a perfect
analogy but I think you see what I'm getting at.
The purpose of Tor is to liberate people from state control and censorship.
Informally, the purpose of Tor is to help people break rules. We support
Tor because we want oppressive rules to be broken but ultimately it's an
anarchist tool, and that's something that's not going to sit well with the

The issue is the speculation on the uses, not what actually constitutes good or evil. There are no metrics out there used in these discussions.? The New Yorker's service, however, is a visible tangible service that doesn't require speculation.

----- Original Message -----
I can see why it would be important for preventing end to end correlation. Given the recent example of the massive grab of phone data from the DOJ, if they knew where the server was located and had suspects in mind, it would make end to end correlation a lot easier for the purposes of identifying a leaker.? So, if the New Yorker is actually serious about preventing that, and regularly moved the keys around to different servers, they could stay ahead of governments looking to use end to end correlation by merely monitoring the New Yorker's site in addition to anyone they fear may leak data.

Regardless of what you want to call it, it's a logical fallacy.? If the source code was proprietary and not available for review, that would be one thing.? But, neither of those scenarios apply.? You can download the source code and compile from source if you desire. Also, it should be stressed that it has been repeatedly stated that Tor probably not something that would hide you from the NSA, regardless of the presence of a backdoor or any other secret code, weakness, etc. that you may believe is present due to a funding source.
