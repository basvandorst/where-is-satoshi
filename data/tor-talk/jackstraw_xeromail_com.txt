@_subject: New Privoxy 3.0.8 with Tor 
I hate to sound lazy, but I find the new version of Privoxy somewhat confusing. And I know that it's me!!
Would it be possible for some kind soul to post 1)A sample user.action file 2) a sample config file designed to allow the browser to connect to My old useraction file and config file for Privoxy 3.06 don't work with I appreciate the help.

@_subject: How do we defeat exit node sniffing? 
I have a question about that, which has puzzled me for quite some time.
Perhaps I'm being too rigid in regards to this.
I have a Gmail account that was created through Tor.
I should say, that this anonymous account is a test account. I use it
for no sensitive communications, however I treat the account as if I do.
  I have only accessed that GMail account through Tor, and my Xerobank
account. Mixing it up. I have  been very cautious in adhering to that.
Well sort of... My bad.
A few months back, in haste, I accidentally accessed the account naked
from my standard IP address. Maybe 2-4 times. That's all. But it happened.
I felt that the account had to be abandoned as it was now "tainted."
But then I thought, "How so?"
Let's say hypothetically, I have accessed that account 1,000 times.
950 times I have logged in using Tor. 48 times I've logged in using my
Xerobank account.
On those few occasions, I've logged in from my home IP.
Logically, how would a potential adversary know where I'm coming from?
For all they'd know, I was traveling, and logged in using a friend's
computer as the access was less than a half dozen times. Unless I'm
missing something, that unintended access really tells them nothing. Or
does it? It may be suggestive, I'd think, but that's it. For some, that
be enough to abandon the account and I understand that.
I accept all that Fox wrote as "Best Practices" and should always be
adhered to. One doesn't want to take risks or play Russian Roulette.
I agree.
But is that account really tainted?

Scott, that was a brilliant answer. And I appreciate the time you invested in it.
I wasn't sure, and I wasn't trying to be defensive or protect a position.
But I could not logically parse, how Gmail logins from an overwhelming majority of random IP's with minimal logins from my valid home IP could possibly compromise the account.
But it is precisely that small number of tainted logins that with careful research would prove to be the most revealing or productive for an adversary. Often, the smallest piece of evidence turns out to be the most significant.
When it comes to security, one must always consider as the priority, the worst possible scenario, which you did.
I wholeheartedly agree. The account is tainted.
Thanks Again!!

Kyle, recently saw your latest contribution: TorVM.
Could you discuss the essential differences between TorVM and JanusVM?
Looking forward to giving this a try!!

Yes. Scroogle seems to be available once again.
I too, suspect it was a misconfiguration in their blocklists. And
perhaps some gentle nudging drew their attention to the matter.

No answer here, but I have been baffled by this strange behavior with
Scroogle, as well, the last week or so. Wonder what's up?
