You're right. I read that in Jens Kubieziel's German blog. (very old pages) Nicknames were allowed earlier?
Country codes are too error-prone. My exits are in Luxembourg. Tor Metrics shows it wrong in the US. :-(
Banning nicknames in ExcludeNodes is than a missing feature by me.

These 600 (and other) are easy to block in torrc:
ExcludeNodes Unnamed,default,ididnteditheconfig
But there are many suspect relay nicknames with just one letter or number. :-(
'ExcludeNodes' must become regex capable.
