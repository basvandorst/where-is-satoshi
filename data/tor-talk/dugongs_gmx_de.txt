@_subject: Could i use tor to login Paypal? 
I was logged in to ebay several times the last days, and yesterday they locked my account. In their message they explain, that they think a third person has logged into my account. Sure they can be right - but my password was a strong one, and this happened just after using ebay through the tor-network. For me it seems obvious, that it has to do with my tor-use.

@_subject: serifos down? 
Hi, on the tor-website there is published as a status page of the tor network... it seems to be down for weeks now?!? I think someone should repair it - or delete it from tor.eff.org

@_subject: tor and its speed 
as we all know, the tor network is not the fastest expierence of the world, but sometimes it's really really slow, that it's nearly impossible surfing the web.... Is there a possibility, to give tor the command to try a new circuit, when it's very slow? Like a firefox extensions, or something else? Thought, this could be very useful... because sometimes tor connections are very fast, sometimes they're unusable. Or is the only way to restart the browser?

Thanks for all this hints! Now I use fasterfox, and it really gives some more performance. The setting 'MaxCircuitDirtiness 300' seems to have no real effects here... anyway - I'll try it with fasterfox, I didn't know this extension until now.

Hi, I just found this scan-entry in my server access.log:
211.100.33.61 - - [04/Sep/2006:22:45:54 +0200] "GET  HTTP/1.1" 404 338 "-" "-"
I've seen this my first time by now... is this a 'normal' scan? Or do I have to be concerned about this?

Here I had to add the following line into the file /etc/dhclient.conf :
prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220;
after that my /etc/resolv.conf looks like this, starting my network:

@_subject: write access 
Hi all,
yesterday I recognized logs like this on my /var/log/tor/debug.log Sep 30 04:55:16.025 [debug] conn_write_callback(): socket 18 wants to write.
Is this normal? The socket number varies from hour to hour...
Why and which sockets have to write here anything? Thought, tor doesn't log anything by default... I'm running a tor-client and a tor-middleman-proxy.
Thanks for any hint,

@_subject: Puzzling behavior of Tor server. 
I configured a middleman-proxy...
...and my logs do look the same. What's wrong with it? It's building new
circuits - seems alright, doesn't it?
??? What do you want to log? I think as a tor-node you/we should log
possibly the traffic, nothing else - providing most possible anonymity.
Am I not right?

@_date: 2006-09-05 01:34:27
@_author: sigi 
@_subject: Puzzling behavior of Tor server. 
so, you don't want to log something special about you're tor-traffic? Possibly I didn't understand that right before... ;)
I think it could be the same thing why paypal and ebay accounts get locked to tor-users frequently: It can happen, that your IP-address changes while you're logged in to your account somewhere, because tor changes the circuit frequently. I know it from paypal and ebay, that they assume that there may be a unauthorised third person, who uses your account when this happens... I think, you can't do anything about that. I had this experience some days ago with ebay: They locked my account, because they thought there was an unauthorized person using my username. I think, it has nothing to do with your tor-server - it's normal. For me your logs do look OK.

@_subject: running tor on a vserver 
Hi, two days ago I set up a Tor-proxy on my vserver - and first it seemed all running ok.
But after some hours there appeared a lot of warnings in my log-file complaining about some buffer-problems:
Jul 08 13:36:55.420 [warn] Error creating network socket: No buffer space available
Jul 08 13:36:55.420 [warn] Error creating network socket: No buffer space available
Jul 08 13:36:55.421 [warn] Error creating network socket: No buffer space available
This messages come up again and again, several times per minute. Since this error affects all other applications on this server, which want to connect to the network, I had to shut down my tor-server for now. I tried to limit my BandWidthRate, with no effects. I tried to edit But I'm not allowed to write to this file. Is there anything, I can do about it? I got this vserver mostly, because I wanted to run tor... and no I have to see it's not working! :-|
If it helps: I was running tor version 0.1.2.14 on debian etch.
Thanks for any help! Regards,

@_subject: running tor on a vserver 
Hi, I played a little with BandwidtRate & -Burst, but the warn-logs showed up again everytime, two hours after restarting tor...
With some friendly help of another tor-user I found the option ConnLimit, which I put into my torrc - and 'ConnLimit 90' has solved the problem. My server is running longer than 2 hours for now, without errors for the first time.
OK, I turned the accounting off and calculated a little on my own. :)

And I thought, it helped, because this is the first time, my server runs a lot longer than 2 hours...
Do you have any suggestions, what I can do else to prevent the logs about the buffer?
Does this mean, I can't do anything about it but restarting my server several times per day?

As I'm running only a bridge-relay now,, is it ok that your suggestions only show three tor-connections? # lsof -iTCP|grep debian-tor|grep 9001|wc -l
In comparison to my middleman before, it's like nothing...
Thanks a lot Jonathan, for your answers!

Hi, I just updated Tor on my server to 0.2.0.24-rc and thought, the following warnings might be of interest: Apr 23 01:55:27.818 [notice] This version of Tor (0.2.0.24-rc) is newer than any recommended version, according to the directory authorities. Recommended versions are: 0.1.2.19,0.2.0.22-rc,0.2.0.23-rc

@_subject: problems with bridge-relay 
Hi, I switched from a middle-man-node to a bridge-relay on my vserver I installed Tor 0.2.0.23-rc on my Debian-system and set the following options in my torrc-file:
SocksPort 0
ORPort 9001
BridgeRelay 1
RelayBandwidthRate 50KBytes
ExitPolicy reject *:*
AuthoritativeDirectory 1
BridgeAuthoritativeDir 1
But with this setting, I get the warning-messages like: Apr 08 19:22:41.312 [warn] Your server (62.75.149.148:9030) has not managed to confirm that its DirPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
Nmap shows, that the ports are open:
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
9001/tcp open  unknown
9030/tcp open  unknown
Has anyone an idea, what's wrong with all this?
Thanks a lot,

Hi, for a year or so, I was running a Tor-middleman-relay, and the monitoring-sites on the net were fine for me. Now I switched to a bridge-relay and was thinking about how to monitor the connections and traffic going through it. I found a plugin for munin, as mentioned here
but this doesn't work, the plugin exits with errors. Now I'd like to get any information, how I can easily monitor my tor-relay: How many connections and how many traffic goes through it. Thanks for your help!

@_subject: ktorrent and tor 
Hi all, I always used ktorrent and tor with its option http-tracker-proxy set to 127.0.0.1:8118 and it ran well over tor...
But now for a unknown reason to me, ktorrent seems to ignore this setting and sends all its tracker-requests not through tor anymore. Does anyone of you use ktorrent and tor and sees this behaviour? If I set up konqueror to use tor, ktorrent uses it too, but for all of its traffic. I'd like to only route the tracker-requests through tor, like I did before.  Has anyone here a hint, where I should look after, or where I missed something? I'm running debian lenny/sid and tried with ktorrent Thanks,

sorry, I really don't know. I'm not using ktorrent very often - and I did some apt-get upgrades since my last use of ktorrent... Today I tried out tork for a while - but this should have no effect I guess, because it's already removed completly and I've restarted my system since then.

@_subject: ktorrent and tor 
I only wanted to use tor for my connections with the tracker-connections, since ktorrent has an option for setting a
http-tracker-proxy. That does not mean, that all download-traffic goes through tor. I think it's reasonable to do this, whatever files anybody wants to share - and it does not use a lot tor-bandwidth.
