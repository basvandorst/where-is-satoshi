@_subject: DNS block in place at 151.8.40.35 (molly) 
i'm running the server molly.
The server has on his second eth interface an experimental dns service to block porn sites.
I've no idea how slashdot.org could come inside, i'll fix it.
I hope this side effect is not too dangerous for tor users ;)

i think there is, now the tor traffic is not filtered. If it will happen again (i'll take an eye on this) i'll move the 2 services on different

- From the FAQ:
7.2. Can exit nodes eavesdrop on communications? Isn't that bad?
Yes, the guy running the exit node can read the bytes that come in and
out there. Tor *anonymizes the origin* of your traffic -- it does not
magically encrypt all traffic throughout the Internet.
I think it's a clear answer. The problem is that a normal user doesn't
read documentation, where to write this important informations?
The 90% of user will find the some news about tor across the internet,
click the download link and read nothing.
Back to  they write something wrong:
"... communication from client to entry node and exit node to server
will still remain as is. Pop3, telnet and others will still be
plain-text and thus subject to sniffing."

@_subject: My ExcludeNodes list...post yours 
Hash: SHA1
I don't use ExcludeNodes at the moment just because i don't trust some
router more than another
how good are (will be) US nodes? Any router from exit node to
destination can be bad....
because they say they're doing something that anybody else can do
without saying?
Isn't better not to use clear authentication at all?
