@_subject: [tor-talk] Why are all Snowflake proxies connecting to a single 
Why are all Snowflake proxies connecting to a single bridge (flakey) instead of connecting to a normal relay of client`s choice, multiple bridges or even connecting  directly to the middle relay so that it serves as a first hop in the three hop circuit?
Isn't this bad for the anonymity of Snowflake users since all users are connecting through the same bridge?
Shouldn't Tor browser circuit display inform users that their connection actually goes through 4 hops (This Browser--->Snowflake proxy--->Bridge (flakey)--->Switzerland---->Germany---->Example.com) instead of three hops (This Browser--->Bridge
