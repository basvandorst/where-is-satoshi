Well, I'm fine with the network load personally but I know people get hate
mail for network load.
I guess I'm a little confused as to what exactly you're trying to do. Can
you possibly draw a diagram such as this:
my client-->tor-->tor loop 2 --> internet
I'm a little confused here.
As for increasing anonymity, the attacks that work against tor such as
end-to-end or timing attacks simply won't be slowed down by routing through
more tor nodes since each node can't really reveal where your connection
came from (to my knowledge). It does work on normal socks proxy chains
because they aren't blind and many keep logs.

I don't really see anything wrong with it if you really want to do it. It

that tor2 sees the ip address of the tor 1 exit node.
I took a look at your other thread. It seems you're worried about your ISP
seeing your traffic, which could just as easily be done from the SSH server
or its ISP. Perhaps you should add cover traffic with a web spider or an
open project like grub.

Here's an example where cover traffic is good. If somebody has access to

cover traffic then those users will ALWAYS show up as the users who are

@_subject: Cover Traffic 
I know that the tor wiki suggests that people use cover traffic in order to
increase their anonymity. Since each link is encrypted, why don't servers
create their own cover traffic using a 1:2 rule. For every one packet it
recieves, it sends 2 blank packets. An adversary observing the connection
wouldn't be able to distinguish between cover traffic and real traffic
(perhaps cover traffic could even have a different private key)
Here's how I imagine it working:
you-->(one packet, two covers)tornode1-->(one packet, two new cover
packets)tornode2-->(one packet, two new cover packets)tornode3-->internet
Once the cover packet  is decoded by the next server, it will recognize it
as a cover packet and simply drop it and generate two new cover packets.
Does this seem like a plausable solution to stop timing and point-to-point

As long as you use the default configuration and set your browser to use a
HTTP proxy, then DNS leaks shouldn't be a problem. The problem occurs when
you tell programs to use tor as a socks proxy and they decide to resolve
their own DNS names. If you block DNS resolving with your firewall the
program might try to resolve the DNS name through tor. If you route a
program through freecap it shouldn't be a problem. DNS leaking was more of a
problem in the past and if tor is passed an IP address (which is a sign of a
DNS leak) it will warn you.

solitary JAP user even though it was against german law. The backdoor was
released as an urgent security update and the guy was nabbed.
As for the tor server, I suggest that you completely wipe those drives
securely, reformat, and reinstall everything. The best thing to do would be
to sell those drives and buy new ones because it could be that they put taps
in them. Also, they could have installed a keylogger. If I were you, I
wouldn't use any of that equipment again. At the very minimum, you need to
reinstall windows/linux/etc. and tor with a reformat because they probably
put in a trojaned version of tor.

Also, it would be more logical instead of having this convoluted camera
setup (which can be defeated by editing the contents of the tape) to get a
very cheap laptop to do all your questionable work on. Then, you can always
have it with you to ensure that the data isn't modified. I would also like
to add that I read somewhere that the power fluctuations when the laptop
charger draws power from the wall can be read and turned into characters
(which is just as effective as a keylogger). You might also want to think
about using a faraday cage to protect from tempest attacks. Sound like
overkill, it is and most of these strategies are. My point here is that
there isn't a bulletproof way to keep your government from finding you. The

I understand the attacks remaining against tor, this would make is
much more complicated to do a timing or deductive attack against the
hidden service even for a global adversary. This would actually act to
the disadvantage to a one-machine hidden service, but it would be a
really good idea for a redundant one. Another question is how do we
keep the wikis in sync without connecting to the other ones every time

It's very interesting and from what I can deduce, right. However, this
isn't new news. What *is* new is that it has been proved using math
and logic. I know that tor will eventually rise to defend this attack
as other applications such as freenet (i2p also?) have. Another
implication to consider of this is what if the same ISP controlled the
entry and exit nodes?

You're right about the ISPs. Again, I just skimmed the article and I

look as these huge communication companies like ATT it seems a little
more possible. If I'm not mistaken, ATT owns more than just a /16

I agree this is something that should be done with the tor controller.
Another thought for people is that they may be going through servers
that are known to be used by intelligence organizations or have a high
logging rate. One problem you might encounter when going through tor
servers on educational/corporate networks is the high amount of
logging that happens. Theoretically, it shouldn't matter but
realistically it does. I suggest windows users check out peerguardian
(peerguardian.sourceforge.net) to block these servers if you wish.
(Linux people check out MoBlock). I did notice that NATO C3 ran a tor

To my knowledge, tor doesn't make registry entries but rather windows

If you're worried about that kind of information, perhaps you should
consider making a "clean" backup and then every few days erasing your
HD and putting it back on. That way, you don't have to worry about the
data because it will be gone. I used this setup for a while and it

I absolutely second that. However, I believe tor should store as

possible. While I don't condone breaking the law generally, I
absolutely condone people bypassing the Great Firewall of China (for
one example). If these people were to be caught with incriminating
evidence, it could cost them their life, a lifetime prison sentence
(include torture in the ROC), or worse. I believe tor should be
helping these people, not hurting them. I don't think tor should go
around deleting parts of logs in other programs or windows, but users
need to be aware it is a risk (as it is with ALL anonymity programs).

You can't traceroute through tor because of the way it's designed.
Your best bet is to NOT chain through the HTTP proxy, go to
ipchicken.com or some other site, and then try it with the http proxy.
This will tell you if you are using tor, and then afterwards, if you
are using an HTTP proxy. Happy surfing.

It depends on how much traffic you are pulling. They will not be able
to decrypt the information, however that doesn't mean they can't
terminate your account. If you upload significantly more than you DL,
then you are technically a server. Chances are they have a "but we can
terminate your account if we don't like you" clause in the TOS so this
is all a moot discussion to have. Basically, if you keep it low
traffic and don't cause any troubles it shouldn't be a problem, but an
FTP server is a different story. I haven't personally had any
experience with Verizon and lots of people would appreciate if you
would post a little report after you've been running it for a while.

If Tor is never allowed to connect to certain nodes, and therefore "doesn't

AFAIK tor connects to an entry guard which then connects to the exit
node for you. This way, they can't take the logs from the exit node
and go "well.. the IP in question connected to you 20 seconds before
the alleged connection was made, so that's who it probably was". This
should be all explained in the docs somewhere.

As long as you don't submit your hidden service to any wikis and it's
not linked to from anywhere, nobody will be able to find out about it.

Did this change after you upgraded KTorrent or something along those
lines? ie What changes could have caused it.

I don't know much about Ktorrent so I can't help you, but hopefully
somebody else can. If you're open to alternatives, you can try azereus
which does have an option to specify http proxying ; /

That doesn't look like they're blocking. Have you tried connecting
through different HTTP proxies? Other versions of tor? Is the log mode
set on debug? Something more verbose could help.

@_subject: Tor On Private Network 
I am trying to set up tor on a private network. I used the python script
that was mentioned previously to make the torrc and the only changes I made
were adding my directory servers and changing the data dir.
I'm running these on OSX Darwin and there's no reason for them to resolve
hostnames because all of my directory servers are run on the LAN and the
torrc only references their IP addresses. I get the following error when I
start Tor.
[warn] Unable to stat resolver configuration in /etc/resolve.conf: No such
file or directory
[err] Error initializing DNS subsystem; exiting
I have run tor on these machines before and never gotten this error until I
tried running it over LAN with my own authoritative directory servers. I
looked at resolve.conf and it's just a shortcut pointing to a file that
doesn't exist. Is there a way to make tor not check this file? Any ideas?
Any help appreciated,
Comrade Ringo Kamens

I took a look at that document, and the only suggested options that seemed
to work were:
EnforceDistinctSubnets 0
ExitPolicyRejectPrivate 0
The rest said that they were unknown options, including
ServerDNSAllowBrokenResolvConf. Any ideas as to why this might be? I tried
setting the DNS settings to make localhost the DNS server but that didn't
seem to work either.

@_subject: Tor On Private Network 
I tried setting localhost as the DNS and it might have worked. Tor no
longer exists because the DNS resolving configuration is broken, but
watch what happens. Just for reference, my private network consists of
three servers who are each set up to be Auth Dir and exit servers and
inherently trust eachother. They are on 169.254.46.12*, this computer
is .125. At some point, Tor realizes that my DNS entry is fake but
thinks that the DNS server is hijacking requests.

Sorry for the incredibly long, detailed log but I wanted there to be
sure there was enough information.
My questions are:
1. Does it matter that Tor thinks its requests are being hijacked?
(Since I know I can trust the servers)
2. How come it says it can't get any network status documents?
3. What next?
Any help is appreciated,

Hash: SHA1
I have a quick question about how tor constructs circuits. Recently I
have started using Tor for my email (Thunderbird). IIRC the default exit
policy does not allow SMTP traffic. Let's say that I'm connected to Tor
server X for HTTP traffic. When I send a request to Tor to use the SMTP
port does it start a new circuit specifically for SMTP traffic or does
it start one that does SMTP and all of my other traffic (HTTP, etc.)?
Any answers appreciated,

Hash: SHA1
Thanks for posting that. It seems to me that having different streams
would make it easier to discern what types of data are being sent. Also,
in the situation where an adversary was watching both ends of the
connection or trying to deduce which computer was a hidden service, I
would imagine that dividing up the streams would make it easier. I don't
know much about network dynamics though, nor have I read the paper.
Regardless, that's some really good, interesting research and I like
seeing this kind of thought being put into Tor.

I have heard of Javascript breaking Tor but that might be speculation.

@_subject: Multiple Tor Installs 
Hey Tor users,
I've got a question that hopefully somebody can answer. I'd like to have
multiple instances of Tor running at the same time for different
connections/identities (that would listen on different ports). Is there
any way to do this?
The only way I can think of is to compile separate versions from source,
manually give them different configs, and then running all of them from
a shell script. The obvious problem with this is that when Tor updates,
I have to do a bunch of re-downloading and re-compiling instead of using
the deb package.
Is it possible to just call Tor multiple times while specifying multiple
configs? I figure this might work but I wanted to check in case there
might be anonymity/security problems.
I'm currently on Ubuntu Ibex.

I was talking about clients, not servers just to clarify. If multiple

there's a lot of traffic), it becomes harder to do traffic analysis and
pin one circuit to one user.
Am I mistaken in that conclusion?

I'm not sure why anybody would ever want to do this, but I did it just
as an experiment. Basically, I installed Windows in a Qemu virtual

to make sure that all of your connections as far as Windows Update goes
are done through the same exit node until you have a chance to restart.
Upgrading from a basic Service Pack 2 installation took me pretty much
the entire day on a high speed connection.
It's also worth nothing that in a situation like this, it really pays to
pick a fast, stable exit node.

to restrict it to one particular exit node but that could have been luck.

I would appreciate any feedback people have on this. This is just an
idea and it's kind of beta, so don't use this unless you know what
you're doing. PGP key at bottom of message
More Secure Tor Browsing Through A Virtual Machine in Ubuntu
Whenever somebody uses the internet through Tor using the standard
set-up, they are assuming that the program (such as Firefox) they're
using is immune to serious remote attacks such as code execution attacks
that could allow an adversary to run commands on their system. It is
possible to use Tor without making these assumptions, thus making Tor
use safer.
The basic idea behind securing Tor browsing through a virtual machine is
to put the user's programs in a sandbox. A virtual machine is the
ultimate example of this. Even if an attacker were to be able to gain
command-line access through a vulnerability in a program such as
Firefox, they still wouldn't be able to obtain the user's IP address,
look at their file system, or gain access to any other
personally-identifiable information.
As an added benefit of running a virtual machine, you can also allow
scripts, flash, and all sorts of other nasty code to run in your browser
as even if it tries to break out it won't be able to. You should be
aware that this will break your anonymity across identities through
things like flash cookies. We'll discuss that more later as well as
steps that can be taken to prevent it.
Unfortunately, virtual machines require a lot of memory, cpu time, and
disk space. If you don't have extra of these, you might want to consider
building a chroot jail instead. If you want to install a virtual
machine, keep reading.
I'll be using Xubuntu for this guide because it's an easy distribution
for newbies to use and it's relatively lightweight. If you're dealing
with less system resources, you might want to try doing this with Damn
Small Linux or installing Fluxbox. If you get it to work, please
document how it was done so other people can lean from your experience.
Part One: Download Xubuntu
The first thing we'll have to do is grab a copy of Xubuntu. If you have
lots of spare resources, you can use Ubuntu as the instructions will be
almost identical.
You can get the 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) version of Xubuntu at
 I strongly suggest you use the
Torrents they provide at
Part Two: Configure Your Host System
While we're waiting for Xubuntu to download, let's set up your host
system. The first thing we'll need to do is create a user to run the
virtual machine. Go to System>Administration>Users and Groups and add a
new user. You'll need to set a password for them, so make sure you write
it down when you do. Also, go to advanced and write down the user id.
I'm calling this user ?torify? in my examples.
I'm assuming you already have Tor/Privoxy set up at the standard ports
(9050 and 8118) if not, please install them and remember any
non-standard configurations you have.
Let's set up our firewall so the ?torify? user can only access localhost:
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner torify -j DNAT
--to-destination 127.0.0.1
This firewall rule will only stick around until you restart your system
(or re-connect to the network). If you want to make it persistent,
there's a guide at  which
explains how to even if you're using the Gnome or Xcfe Network Manager.
If you have any software listening on any port (even if it's only
accessibly from localhost) then the virtual machine will be able to see
it. This is not a risk if you're browsing Tor safely in your virtual
machine but if you allow flash, java, etc. then it could become a risk.
A common open port on Linux systems is port 631, which is the CUPS
service's web interface for managing print jobs. If you open
 in your web browser, you should be able to see if
it's there or not. You can temporarily disable it by going to the System
Monitor (in System>Administration), finding cupsd in the process list,
and killing it. This will only kill CUPS until the next system restart
(or possibly the next login).
Next, we'll install the software required to run the virtual machine.
Type the following command in the terminal (Start>Accessories>Terminal).
If your processor doesn't support virtualization, you should only
install qemu. If you don't know if your processor supports it, go ahead
and install it as you can always remove it later.
sudo aptitude install qemu kqemu-common kqemu-source
Once this is installed, you'll have to restart. Go ahead, I'll still be
Now that you've got Qemu/KVM installed, let's do the final step in
configuring your system. Remember where I asked you to write down the
user id? Replace ?id? in the following two commands with the id of your
?torified? user.
sudo adduser `id -un` libvirtd
sudo adduser `id -un` kvm
This allows your torify user (and virtual machine) to take advantage of
advanced virtualization features if you have them.
Part Three: Install and Browse
So you're almost ready to start browsing via Tor.  First we'll need to
make a hard drive for your virtual machine. I suggest around 8G
(gigabytes) but you can do more. To make a hard drive of this size in
your current directory, run this command:
qemu-img create -f raw file.disk 8G
Run this command to start installing your virtual machine. You can
change what's after -m if you have more or less available memory
(megabytes). Some processors have additional virtualization support.
Instead of using qemu, just try using kvm (same text after the command).
If you get errors or it doesn't work, you should probably stick with
qemu. Next, run this command to boot your torified operating system.
qemu -hda file.disk -m 512 -name TorMachine -cdrom
xubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso -boot d
Select ?try xubuntu without any changes..? and then double-click the
install icon on the desktop when it's loaded. The instructions are
pretty straight-forward. When it asks you for a network proxy, type in
 so it can grab updates.
Once Xubuntu is installed, be sure to restart and update everything
before browsing the web. It will automatically notify you of updates. If
it doesn't notify you of any updates, something may have gone wrong so
manually check by running the command ?sudo update-manager?.
Part Four: Using Your Virtual Machine
Alright, we're all done setting up your virtual machine. All of your
proxy settings in Xubuntu should be the same as in your host system
except that you should replace 127.0.0.1 with 10.0.2.2. I strongly
suggest installing TorButton and NoScript in your web browser but
allowing scripts is also a possibility.
Before you start your virtual machine, make sure you've applied the
iptables rules and disabled CUPS. Then, use this command from the
directory with your virtual hard drive to start your virtual machine. Go
in and tweak the settings just how you like them.
qemu -hda file.disk -m 512 -name TorMachine
In the future, if you're not planning on changing settings, saving
files, etc. or you're taking the risk of allowing active scripts to run,
make sure you add ?-snapshot? to the end of the command you start your
virtual machine with. This will stop your virtual machine from saving
any changes that are made to it, like flash cookies. Changes will be
stored while only you're using the virtual machine, so when you close it
and re-open it, it's like starting a fresh system.
If you have any suggestions for changes to this guide, feedback, or
questions please drop me an email at ringo{at}hackbloc.org.

@_subject: More Secure Tor Browsing Through A Virtual Machine in Ubuntu 
When I started working on this, I knew that projects like TorVM and
incognito existed, but I wanted to try something different. The problem
being that if an attacker is able to compromise the browser, the http
proxy, or Tor, the user could have their IP revealed, or at least that
was my understanding of it. I'm not sure what protections the current
systems have against this, but I'm guessing it's something along the
lines of a set of iptables rules that restrict certain
users/applications to localhost?
If we add that to the host of other problems that seems to come with
using Tor in a truly secure manner (updates in programs that break user
anonymity, people who want to run active scripting and remote code,
etc.), we're looking at a giant problem that can best be solved by
sandboxing the entire operating system instead of just certain
applications/users/parts of the OS.
In my model, the virtual machine can only connect (even as root) to the
host machine. I figure that anything running in a "torified" environment
should never need to access anything other than Tor, so I just removed
the possibility of that happening.
The problem with this model, as you state correctly is the high resource
usage and I think there's some way to bring this down but that's not
somewhere where I have a ton of experience.
I'm also working on a hidden service set-up guide using a similar model
and I did a little to lessen resource usage but much more needs to be
done. I think that for a browser vm, most consumer-grade computers can
handle a vm running damn small linux or some similar distro.

Hash: SHA1
Hey Tor Users,
I teach a workshop on privacy and anonymity and I've gotten some
questions that I didn't know how to answer. Maybe somebody can answer a
few of these.
1. If I have multiple Firefox profiles, one of which is exclusively for
Tor use, if I use another profile with javascript later on, is that a
threat to the data stored in the other profiles? Can add-ons see
information in other profiles?
2. If I'm doing my Tor browsing in one browser (say, Firefox) and open
up another one (say Ephiphany) that has javascript enabled, what risks
do I face? AFAIK javascript can see what's in your clipboard, which
would be bad if I'm using the clipboard with Torified content Is that it?
3. One of the common criticisms of NoScript+Tor is that a malicious exit
node can pretend to be any site it wishes. What about enabling js on
file:// urls? If I understand them correctly, the browser won't make any
external requests and then there would be no threat of an attack.
4. TorButton (wisely) disabled updates. Aside from the risk of an exit
node making you download it's own module, what other risks are there?
Does firefox submit any information that could identify you aside from
what plugins you use?

Hey Tor,
I've been hard at work on my hidden service LAMP setup guide. I've run

On my setup, I have a guest machine running in Qemu (ubuntu server) with
LAMP. I have set up and installed drupal and wordpress successfully from
 localhost, but when I access wordpress externally something weird happens.
My Torrc tells Tor to forward traffic to localhost:5022. In turn, Qemu
passes port 5022 traffic to the guest OS on port 80. When I visit drupal
on the site through the hidden service URL, everything works as expected
and my browser thinks everything is happening on port 80. When I visit
the wordpress directory, I get a timeout and Firefox tries to go through
port 5022. (Privoxy was unable to socks4a-forward your request
  through 127.0.0.1:
SOCKS request rejected or failed.) My guest OS should not know about the
host OS or what port it's forwarding on (in fact I think it sees the
traffic as coming from 10.0.something.something), so I'm baffled as to
what could be occurring. Here's the line I invoke qemu with:

@_subject: Question: Hidden Services, Virtual Machines, and iptables 
Hey Tor users,
My work to write a how-to manual for setting up and securing hidden
services is well underway, but I've got a question that's been getting
at me.
Obviously, hidden services are the 'most secure' when they're run inside
a virtual machine (qemu, vmware, etc. pick your poison). One could
certainly run Tor inside the vm and then have that torrc contain the
instructions for the hidden service. The problem then, is that the vm
has to access the web. We would only want the vm accessing the web IF it
was going through Tor, but we wouldn't want to just route all vm traffic
through the host's Tor client because then you could be running Tor...
over Tor.
One solution would be to create an iptables blacklist (on the host) and
then ban connections to any computers which *aren't* Tor servers. This
seems like it might be a little work to implement and an adversary could
always set up a Tor server if they could hack your hidden service and
remotely execute code (or cause your web server to fetch external content).
Of course, one could always run a hidden service on the host machine and
then redirect all traffic to the vm, but the pitfalls in this are
obvious. You've only got one layer of encryption and any serious
exploits found in Tor could be used against the host machine, revealing
the true IP address of the hidden service. Also, if somebody were forced
to reveal the encryption key to the hard drive, the game would be up as
opposed to running a vm from a deniably-encrypted truecrypt drive that
was mounted remotely via ssh.
Does anybody have any solutions to this dilemma or thoughts on ways to
restructure the model so this isn't a problem?
Also, anybody with hidden service security tips (particularly on
implementing a LAMP server) is welcome to contact me off-list for
obvious reasons. My PGP key is pasted below.

That's a good solution, but it sounds like it would take lots of
memory/cpu, especially if you're running both of these VMs from an
encrypted partition. If a serious exploit was found in Tor (or
implemented in Tor), it would still be able to break out of the main VM,
but at least it still wouldn't have a real IP address.
I still feel like there's got to be a simpler way to do this.

@_subject: Running a Tor Server as a Tax Deduction? 
I was thinking about how to get more companies/organizations to run Tor
servers and then it hit me that maybe the expenses associated with doing
so could be taken as a tax exemption. It's hard to convince a company to
run a Tor server, but if it's in their financial interest, you might
have a little more leveragee.
Do people think that running a Tor server could be seen as a donation to
the Tor Project (which is a 501(c)(3) charity IIRC)? Or is this kind of
like deducting mojitos as "business drinks"? Obviously I'm not looking
for advice from a CPA/accountant (although that would be great), just
wondering based on people's personal knowledge of tax law. If people
think it's worth looking into (or maybe possible), I'd be happy to hire
a CPA/tax expert and talk with them about it. I just thought I'd ask
here before throwing my money away ; )

"I'm not a CPA, but as I understand it, you need to give actual
valuables to a 501c3"
Valuables can include lots of things. I know of companies who have
donated inventory, labor, and all sorts of services and then deducted it
on their taxes. I'm not sure if a Tor server would fall within in,
especially considering both the donator and the Tor Project has to
maintain a record of this.
If it's possible to deduct Tor servers, maybe the Tor project can have a
"special donor" program for people/organizations/companies who donate
large amounts of resources, their internet connection, or other
quantifiable amounts.

Hey all,
Sorry I've been posting so much to the list lately, I've been working a

One thing I notice is that Torbutton sets no proxy for ftp/gopher. Is
there any particular reason it doesn't tell firefox that privoxy handles
this (which would just kill the connection). It seems to me like this

"Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe someone made HS

As far as I know, no such feature has been implemented. No security
would be gained by such a feature anyways. If you don't give your hidden
service address to anybody, nobody will ever find it. One could
theoretically guess addresses, in which case you can add a password

Remotely disabling Tor nodes is a slippery slope. So it sounds like
somebody is abusing the Tor network to do auction fraud, but that kind
of stuff occasionally happens with a system like Tor. Should we filter
exit nodes because we know this is going on? I wouldn't think anybody
would answer yes to that.
We already can disable nodes by marking them 'invalid'. I for one would
never run Tor if I knew that directory servers could run code on my
machine or tell my Tor client to shut down.
As for disabling these nodes because they're zombied, I again don't
think this is Tor's place. If somebody wants to contact the ISP or the
owner of the zombie machines that's one thing but I think as long as
there's a computer routing traffic for us that isn't malicious, we
should keep it. I don't think there should be a 'tor police' that goes
around determining if a node is legitimately obtained or not.

Hash: SHA1
Hey Torland,
I've got a question about the way Tor chooses circuits. Sometimes I use
Thunderbird to send mail via Tor (yeah, I know, DNS leaks) and I notice
some interesting behaviour.
It's my understanding that when Tor receives a request for a port that
the current circuits don't allow (like SMTP), it creates a new circuit
for it. I notice that I can keep trying to send mail for like half an
hour (once a minute) before it finally goes through. What's interesting
is that if I restart Tor and make that request right when it starts up,
it almost always goes through without any difficulty. I'm not bandwidth
limited so it's not like the other circuits are eating all my bandwidth.
Does anybody else experience similar behaviour? Any possible explanations?

Hey Tor users,
I'll be working on improving hidden service security and usability this
summer (starting in about three weeks). I'm currently attending the
Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA and am working on an 'independent
 contract' which is basically designing a program/class for myself. This
isn't a GSoC project but it's similar.
Tor's client interface is easy to use and well documented, but the same
can't be said for hidden services. Many of the people who need these
services the most like human rights organization and our beloved Chinese
dissidents probably aren't able to set up a hidden service due to the
level of technical expertise it requires. As far as I have been able to
find, there is no guide to setting up secure hidden services nor is
there any program that helps facilitate it. So that's what I'll be
working on.
Specifically, I will be creating a how-to guide for securing standard
LAMP servers as well as a script that will help Linux users set them up.
I have a few ideas for locking down apache, php, etc. but I would
appreciate any other ideas admins of hidden services have as well as
suggestions on how to implement them.

This is actually something that I thought about but I decided to go for
Linux for a few reasons. The first one being my own experience in Linux
is much greater than that in Windows and the second one being that
installing Ubuntu has become easy enough that I suggest it to
non-techies. If somebody is serious about running a forum for Chinese
dissidents, for example, then they're probably willing to install Linux
on a machine dedicated to it. I think that windows-only clients might be
more likely for personal hidden sites than sites that require constant
uptime. Since sites that require constant uptime usually require a
separate machine, it seems to me that encouraging people to run Linux is
probably a good choice especially given the risks that individual might
be taking by running a hidden service. I would rather have somebody use
Linux instead of Windows because there's no guide for Windows than the
other way around. I agree with you though that somebody needs to do the
same thing I'm doing but for Windows.
I haven't ever done any fingerprinting of hidden services but it would
be interesting to see how many/if any run Windows. As far as I can tell,
most of onionland is run by some dedicated techies who mainly use Linux,
but I could be wrong.
