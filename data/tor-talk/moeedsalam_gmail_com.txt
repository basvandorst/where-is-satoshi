Hello friends I'm new on the list. I hope you bear with my questions and
I just installed Camilo's version of Vidalia, and it seems i have a couple
of problems:
1) You can only exclude one country from the "invalidnodes" settings.
2) You have to exclude it every time you start vidalia (it does not save the

@_subject: Couple more questions 
Hey guys, a few more questions for the experts:
1) I noticed that the Tor-IM-Browser package uses GAIM, routed through SOCKS
5:9050. If I am using GAIM with TOR/Privoxy, should i set Gaim to use SOCKS
5:9050 or,  or HTTP 127.0.0.1:8118 and routing it through privoxy?
2) I am using Firefox routed to 8080 proxomitron routed to 8118 privoxy. Any
comments on this? I hope I am still preventing DNS leakage, as it seem like
Proxomitron gives me more filtering of scripts, etc than prvixy.
3) Should I change from privoxy to polipo? I am a windows xp user.
Thanks for all.

@_subject: Vidalia exit-country 
Ok, Camilo, let me get this straight.
1) Strict Exit Relay Management is for limited the exit node to one country.
2) Exclude Relay Management, is for excluding certain countries, but does it
exclude it as a exit node or as a TOR node?
Also, will it still form a connection yet not use it? Or should it not even
form a connection?
Here's my problem. I have excluded USA and UK from the dropdown list using
ctrl key as you said and added them, but i see that connections are still
formed with them as a TOR node and also as exit nodes.
NOt only that, I also noticed that it even routed my request through an exit
node through UK, specifically:

@_subject: same first hops 
Thanx Gregory  and F.Fox...understood the concept. Just one note though:
"Tor (like all current practical low-latency anonymity designs) fails when
the attacker can see both ends of the communications channel. For example,
suppose the attacker is watching the Tor relay you choose to enter the
network, and is also watching the website you visit."
When it says "watching" does it mean? I thought the info was encrypted
(except the last hop) and the IP invisible? Does it mean timing attacks?

@_date: 2008-10-09 06:50:49
@_author: M 
@_subject: same first hops 
ok understood, so in actuality he would have to be observing 3 things:
1) The user' s computer (timing and size)
2) the first hop ((timing and size)
3) the last hop ((timing, size and anythign else)
He would have to be observing the user computer, as there would be no other
way to correlate the first hop with the user, since the IP is hidden at the
first hop, correct?

@_subject: default setting in pidgin 
Hi guys,
I was wondering why the default settings in Pidgin in the TOR-IM-Browser is
set to* log chats and private messages*. I think this is quite contrary to
the main purpose of TOR, which is anonymity, as it may very well be
compromised if the if the USB, etc, falls into the other people's hands.
Also, i dont think most people go into into the settings to change them, as
they feel the setting are already optimized by the crew.

@_date: 2010-01-24 16:07:05
@_author: M 
@_subject: default setting in pidgin 
The pidgin also has an OTR addon, so the point is also privacy along with
anonymity, and one or the other or both will be compromised in case the usb
is lost, discovered, left in someones device, etc...
Anyways, yes, i can turn it off, but the hundreds of others may not explore
the settings, or they may not even understand them.
I fell the settings should be changed so that it does not log by default.

I think the default settings are actually done by the TOR programmers, as
the default proxy settings are routed to TOR.
and note that the *main* use case of pidgin is
I understand your point, but i dont believe the main use of Pidgin users
routed through TOR
is non-anonymous and will want to retain logs.

I have read some of the previous posts but fail to understand.
I have configured my portable thunderbird  to use TOR. In the proxy settings, i have entered port 8118, for http and ssl, and 9050 or socks 5.
I have added 3 accts: gmail, yahoo, and hotmail. i can access yahoo and hotmail thru an add-on called webmail. Also, hotmail allows pop3 if you change the type to hotmail asia.
When i connect, i can see that the connections are made thru tor from the network map.
I am unsure of the following:
1) DNS leak, as there is no socks4a
2) Several posts said that your outgoing mail will have my real IP. Is this true? and why when i am connected thru TOR?
Also, if these things are true, then how can i go about doing it properly? Any help would be much appreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] spam??/socks4a for mac 
Hey guys.. i have sent several messages to the list. but i hardly receive
any response!
I was wondering maybe it was landing in people's spambox.
If you receive this message, can you just add a note so i know that my
messages are going through?
Also a question.. does anyone know any mac software which can route programs
through socks4a?  i searched quite a bit on the net but could not find any.
thanks alot in advance!

?Filezilla on mac does not have socks 4a, so i want to route it through
something link sockscap. Also to route other  programs which do not have an
area to change the proxy settings.

Does anyone have any info about this program? Will it correctly route things
through TOR safely? Why do they claim to be " improved alternative  for
Tor+Vidalia+Privoxy bundle for Windows users".

would using bridges prevent the ISP from knowing that a person is using tor?

Hope it gets done sooner than later! Or else the many people who rely on tor
in Pakistan ,may face some problems!
