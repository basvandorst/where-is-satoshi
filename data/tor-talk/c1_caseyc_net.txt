It is definitely possible, but having gone through it, I can't really
recommend it. My device was a consumer Ubiquiti machine. Setting up
cross-compilation is a major pain (and the distribution packages are old
and unsigned), plus there's just so little ram. I think you device has
32 MiB of ram and only 4 MiB of flash. Tor is fairly efficient, and it
will work, but it's hard to simultaneously use and, say, do serious
configuration management.
I gave up and spent $35 (now ?30) on a Raspberry Pi and never went back.
The box has enough CPU to build tor itself, and the 512 MiB of ram means
it's actually useable. Plus, Linux supports 802.1q VLAN tagging. I set
up a separate VLAN on my network and used the Pi to do the translation.
A few more moving pieces, sure, but way easier.

Frankly, Tor's twelve-year delay in implementing RFC 3514* is a stain
upon its reputation.

Hi there!
I wrote something similar a few years back, but didn't publicize it widely:
It does the same basic thing, but uses golang instead of bash. It also uses the tor API port, rather than spinning up a new daemon. Some advantages, some disadvantages.
Ultimately, something makes me uncomfortable about the iptables rules that redirect traffic from the container's interface. I just don't somehow trust their ability to block everything. I'd really like a way to do this without a bunch of annoying iptables work.
I've been looking at two new ways that might be able to avoid this.
Have you looked in to flatpak's portals? On the one hand, Flatpak can do rootless / unpriveleged isolation. On the other hand, it relies on unprivileged user namespaces, which have been huge sources of nasty kernel exploits. grsecurity and debian disable them, and with good reason.
In the containerization world, the crazy people at Cilium have written a cool bpf program that connects two TCP sockets directly, without ever needing to be routed. They're doing it for performance reasons, but I think it would be even more useful for doing tor-style isolation.
Given that you can now attach bpf programs to individual cgroups, I feel like this might finally be the way forward.
