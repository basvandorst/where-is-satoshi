also, I realized that two of the posts I've made this this list have now
been reddit-related. Sorry about that. But I'd really like to know what you
all make of this. He doesn't give very many specifics, unfortunately. What
do you think his 'sidestepping' is?

Speaking of Tor on phones, has anybody tried the Shadow browser for Android
yet? I was quite impressed. Bin/src:

I was thinking about undertaking this project myself, but using a cTor
binary and JNI, but now you've done this. Good work!

I know there have to be some really interesting .onions out there, but I've
been having trouble finding them, so I started a reddit.com 'subreddit' to
do some of that web 2.0 magic and let the good ones bubble up.
 , if any of you have anything to share,
that'd be pretty cool.

Jacob - Are you aware of TorProxy / Shadow Browser for Android -
 - is this going to
building on that? Either way, I'm excited. I've gotten quite good at
Android stuff and would be interested in helping out, if you need a

Perhaps, that is a good reason FOR Tor to be on Android.
I'm a huge android fan (currently making my living off of Android
development, in fact) - and the reason that it is so interesting to me
is because it covers all of the major US carriers, numerous
international carriers, and it's available on both high and low end
phones. There is a huge amount of interoperability that you just don't
get by just developing for a single Nokia phone.

Dealing with Chromium devs on incognito integratio is a great idea.
While we're discussing the bundle, I'd like to mention something
that's been on my mind lately. I recently ran a Privacy Tech Workshop
at the Students for Free Culture conference in DC - and the general
conclusion is that Tor/FF is too hard to use and set up  (and I think
that this has been the conclusion from the folks at the
OpenNetInitiative at Harvard about the real-world usage of censorship
resisting tools in Iran and such) and that most people end up using
the first result on whatever search engine for "get around blocked
internet", etc, which ends up using a webproxy.
So - Tor needs to be easier to use.  The solution that we decided we'd
like to see is a stand-alone Tor client - essentially a version of FF
with Tor natively, invisibly integrated without any long-standing
background services (a single executable to launch all of the
necessary components and close them down when the browser quits). This
could be published as SafeBrowser or something obvious like that. As a
group we decided we'd like to work on producing that, although I don't
have much free time in the next few weeks and already have numerous
projects on my plate. Still, I do plan on following up with that, just
thought you might be interested in the idea.
