Ja, schreib auch noch an den BND und an das Innenminesterium. Mann, ich m?chte Dich nicht als Spinner abtun, aber Du schreibst bl?den Bl?dsinn. The SPIEGEL as a tor node hoster, booouahhhh! C' mon us-americans support the tor network and ask the CIA to open? more tor nodes. Thanks.
Regards Dieter
Hi altogether,
today there came out a article in the german newspaper "Spiegel"
regarding anonymizing services. They wrote about tor, also in a positive way. So I decided to send them a mail asking them to run one or more tor-nodes. I think this would be good for the tor project when journalists start running tor nodes by themselves. It is one thing only to write about that and another thing to become active within this project. Thats what I wrote (german lang):
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
es freut mich sehr, da? Sie in Ihrem Magazin das tor-Netzwerk positiv erw?hnen, beteilige ich doch mit zwei Knoten an diesem Netzwerk. Das mache ich nicht zuletzt, um Journalisten oder politisch Verfolgten die M?glichkeit zur un?berwachten Kommunikation zu bieten. Eines ist jedoch unabdingbar wichtig: so viel Leute bzw Institutionen wie m?glich sollten sich an diesem Netzwerk beteiligen, indem sie einen tor-Knoten beisteuern. Nach meinem Kenntnisstand betreibt der SPIEGEL zur Zeit noch keine(n) tor-Knoten, was ich sehr schade finde. Bitte ?berlegen Sie sich, sich mit einem oder mehreren tor-Knoten an diesem Netzwerk zu beteiligen. Immerhin bietet dieses Netzwerk auch den Journalisten des SPIEGEL interessanteste M?glichkeiten, an staatlicher Zensur vorbei zu kommunizieren.
Mit freundlichen Gr??en
Thomas Hluchnik

@_subject: Is http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu dead? 
I didn' t use tor for a year or so. So things might
have changed. I use tor with a shell script that
excludes tor from using specific european countries.
German and belgium servers for example. To run this
script i need router information. Got those from
But this link seem to be dead. Is there another source
to get router infos?

Thanks for the answers, i know most of the mentioned
urls, but how can i access a text file with all tor
servers? I never saw something like that on these
pages, not even a link.
I tried this:
and the result was a FORBIDDEN (You don't have
permission to access /exit.pl on this server.)

@_subject: ktorrent and tor 
NOBODY should reply to questions of this kind.
tor with ktorrent?
tor with azureus?
Tsss ...
All list members should be highly alarmed if somebody asks for help using azureus or shareaza. Both clients in the hands of experienced programmes can be used to spy the tor network. Yes, i know this is not the case this time. A kid asked for help in downloading ilegal (?) music via anonymous tor network, which is idiotic and no serious tor user should answer questions like this. But again, be alarmed if someone asks for help using shareaza or azureus. Both clients are used to spy the tor network.
well, if I don't find a solution for this, I think have to change my client to azureus... but I'd be a liitle sad, because I liked ktorrent a lot... Thanks a lot for your really fast answers!

@_subject: Need help for a friend who lives in the Iran 
He needs to get arround the exclemation mark problem.
I asked him to use a proxy. But it seems that all
known proxys - fast proxys - are more or less blocked
from the Iran.
I asked him to use tor or the more risky JAP service.
It seems that tor is a illegal software in the Iran.
But we don' t know that for sure. The problem is that
he doesn' t want to ask people outsite of the Iran,
because his provider filters email and connections
like they do it in Germany. Does aynbody know more

@_subject: I am at my wits end, I cant register for account at digg.com using tor 
Right. But be realistic, even if you are surfing the
CIA' s website or to top it the FBI (have more VEDA if
you know what that is), they wouldn' t sniff you. Why
should they? And if, what are the sniffed infos worth?
In most cases nearly NULL!
To me it is pure nonsense to use tor and try to
register with digg. That is idiotic to me!

@_subject: German Tor-Exitnode mailinglist (exitnodes@lists.ccc.de) 
Well, germany and tor.
I know that there are a lot of tor servers and i know
they are fast and frequently used. But i would never
ever use a german exit node. NEVER!
I for myself have excluded all german and belgium exit
nodes. I am unsure about the german authorities and
their wild activities against terrorism, copyright
issues and the whole internet, maybe the day will come
and germany introduces its own internet that is OFF
for the world and the world is OFF from germany.
Yes, i use proxies from china. :)

@_subject: German data rentention law 
Good overview Karsten, thanks.
Tor developers: I demand to ban all german tor server per /1/1/2009 from the tor network. Don' t trust the german regulators.
# Set one or another, but not both, alphabetical order plz:
 # Those countries will be rejected.
COUNTRIES_TO_ACCEPT="AR|US"; # All other countries will be rejected, those only will be accepted.
# Where to find a routers list:
# Location of your torrc file:
# Command to reload your torrc:
RELOAD="/etc/init.d/tor restart"
 No need to modify nothing after this line set -e
test -z $TORRC && exit 0
# create a backup of the torrc file
cp $TORRC ${LOCRC}.bak
# Remove ExcludeNodes line from torrc
cat $TORRC | grep -vi Excludenodes > $LOCRC
# Download routers list.
wget -O $LOCROUT $ROUTERS || exit 0
# Write list of actual countries to a text file for reference
echo -n "Countries " > $file
for i in `cat $LOCROUT | cut -f 1 -d " "| grep -v Tor | sort -u`; do
??? echo -n "$i " >> $file
echo -n "ExcludeNodes " >> $file
if [ "$COUNTRIES_TO_ACCEPT" != "" ]; then

# Have Tor to reload its config
I. part: A short overview about the data rentention law in Germany.
  1: ISPs have to log the start and end of a user dial-in with
     time stamp and IP address. They have not to log any content.
  2: Public provider of electronic mail have to log all connections of
     users with time stamp, IP address, login account and the email
     addresses of sender and recipient for every mail (send and
     receive).
  3: VoIP provider have to log all connections with timestamp,
     IP address and phone number of caller and recipient.
  4: Fon and mobile fon provider have to log all connections and
     tries with timestamp, phone number and location.
  5: Anon services have to log the rewrite of any information, which
     will be logged by a third party. (Thats all, not very clear.)
At the moment, it seems not clear, how tor is affected by this law.
I read some papers from the gouverment: "An anon service (like tor or
JAP) has to log, because the law will be useless otherwise."
Some papers of non-gouverment organizations like ULD: "Tor and JAP are
not affected by the telecommunication law, because it is not a
telecommunication service (in the case of law) and tor nodes have NOT
to log."
Together with the JonDos GmbH (JAP) the GPF try to get a legal
non-logging solution for tor, but the result is open and we are late.
(May be too late?)
II. part: suggestion of a technical solution
May be, tor can use geoip and divide the world in a logging area and a
non-logging area. If the target host is inside the logging area
(Germany), the exit node has to be outside. Otherwise a german node
can be an exit too.
In this case, we have two possibilities:
  1: the target host is outside the logging area -> no logging
  2: the target host is inside the logging area -> the exit is
     outside and writes no logs -> an german entry or middle man
     has to log nothing, because it routes to a not logging exit.
Because not all clients will update to a new version very quickly,
we need a feature for german exit nodes to reject all routes from old
clients, when the node is the exit of the route.
Or, if it was more simple for the developer, a feature for exit nodes
to define a country (based on geoip) to reject all exit routes. If all
german relays used this feature, it may work.
Otherwise, all german nodes have to switch to middle man.
It is only one suggestion, not the really best solution.

@_subject: Bittorrent 
Sorry, but the bittorrent stuff (remember that fuckin japanese magazine that told japanese girls and boys to use tor for bittorrent, wasn' t that two years ago?) breaks tor. Not the big servers with 40 MB u/d or so but the smaller servers.
Yes Scott Benett i agree with you, use tor to connect to the childporn world. You are right for 100% :). I agree, it is up to the owners how they use their tor servers. You' re right for 100%.
To germerhausen and Bonetti: Please don' t use or-talk's email for your flameware. I don' t know about germerhausen, but you Bonetti use this list very frequently. You write this and that, but if somebody ask a real life question you don' t reply. If you are such a big king, please, reply to my email from 8 or 9 months ago and help friends in the Iran to use tor riskless. You find my or-talk mail via google. Thanks.

@_subject: Help Iranian dissidents 
12 (?) or 15 months ago i ve asked the list to help people from iran with tor. I got no help. There were other questions "help me, i can? t login to google via tor" or "help me i can create a account with digg via tor". The questioners got their desired help. Thats dingy!
Anyway, if the provider shuts down, the internet is down. Nobody needs help with tor if the internet is down. Right? That was or is the problem with some providers today in Iran.
