Is your problem (i) how to tunnel the FTP stream through Tor or (ii) how
to use TLS / SSL with FTP?
(i) In FileZilla, select "Edit" -> "Settings" and then under
    "Connection" -> "Generic Proxy".  There, select "SOCKS 5" and -- if
    you have the default settings for Tor -- enter "localhost" for the
    proxy host and 9050 for the proxy port.
    Alternatively, you could try to start FileZilla from the command
    line via torsocks if you want a one-time thing:
        $ torsocks filezilla
(ii) There are two types of FTP+TLS: implicit and explicit mode.  The
     latter is more common today.  You'll have to find out what your FTP
     server offers.  If you are unlucky, it offers neither of them and
     you cannot use TLS unless you convince the admin to add support for
     it.  To open an FTP connection with explicit TLS encryption from
     FileZilla, simply prefix the host name with the string 'ftpes://'.
     So, to connect to the server at 'ftp.example.com', you'd type
     'ftpes://ftp.example.com' into the "Host" field of FileZilla.
     That's it.
Using Tor and end-to-end encryption via TLS are two orthogonal security
measures and you can combine them in any of the four possible ways that
makes most sense for you.
Unfortunately, it seems that some FTP servers are blocking IPs that
appear bogous to them, which traffic originating from Tor might do.
vsftpd seems to do that so, sadely, I could not even connect to my own
server when I tried the above instructions a minute ago.  I will look
into changing this in the vsftpd config when I have time for it.
Happy Hacking

I would very much welcome the Tor Browser Bundle shifting to use
Iceweasel or, maybe even better, GNU IceCat, as its base.  I am running
an operating system with exclusively free software and currently I
cannot / don't want to use the Tor Browser Bundle since many (all?)
libre GNU/Linux distributions (as recognized [1] by the Free Software
Foundation) consider the standard Firefox distribution as being not
100 % libre.
Mozillas decision to incorporate EME into its browser was a mistake in
my opinion.  However, it would be just great to take this as a chance
to make the Tor Browser Bundle even more libre and save many people the
headache of having to choose between a maximum of privacy and a maximum
of free software.
