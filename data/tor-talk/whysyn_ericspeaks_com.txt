@_subject: stuff making it around the exit policy? 
In troubleshooting another problem on my server this morning, I found
what is apparently traffic that circumvents the ExitPolicy...
netstat output:
tcp        0      0 66.219.161.166:42132    131.215.166.198:6882
ESTABLISHED 26815/tor
66.219.161.166 is a secondary address on my box that does nothing but
tor.  What gives?
Here is a copy of my ExitPolicy from torrc:
ExitPolicy reject 0.0.0.0/255.0.0.0:*
ExitPolicy reject 169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0:*
ExitPolicy reject 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0:*
