@_subject: [tor-talk] Client obfs4 Trouble 
I'm using Tails 1.4.
I try to edit the torrc file to add obfs4 bridges and I can not figure it
out. I keep having trouble with the ClientTransportPlugin.
I've also searched and searched and searched!
Currently I have  (I altered the Bridge address, not valid but a true
representative of a valid address)
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy -managed
Bridge obfs4 91.233.41.123:43546 2AEG55G3J4G3J490GJ934G34GG
When I try to save it, the settings menu pop up with a reference to see the
log. Which says...
"Message Log
[Warning] Managed proxies are not compatible with Sandbox
mode.(ClientTransportPlugin line was "obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy")
[Warning] Controller gave us config lines that didn't validate: Invalid
client transport line. See logs for details."
When I run it in the terminal I get this...
amnesia at amnesia:~$ /usr/bin/obfs4proxy --managed
flag provided but not defined: -managed
Usage of /usr/bin/obfs4proxy:
  -enableLogging=false: Log to TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION/obfs4proxy.log
  -logLevel="ERROR": Log level (ERROR/WARN/INFO)
  -obfs4-distBias=false: Enable obfs4 using ScrambleSuit style table
  -unsafeLogging=false: Disable the address scrubber
  -version=false: Print version and exit
Please help,
Thank You!
