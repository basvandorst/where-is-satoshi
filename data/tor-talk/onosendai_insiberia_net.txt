@_subject: [tor-talk] Upgrade and problems 
Hi list,I have some problems after an upgrade. I used tor v0.2.2.30 and earlier
without any problems.After an upgrade, with tor v0.2.2.32 and v0.2.2.33 i can't
connect to the tor network. I'm using slackware and installed tor from
slackbuilds.org, with v0.2.2.32 my last row in tor log is
[notice] Bootstrapped 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server.
and this is my tor.debug
what's the problem?
