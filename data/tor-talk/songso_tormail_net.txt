@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser standalone without videla/tor bundle 
I understand that the browser supplied in the browser bundle has been
preconfigured, patched and modified for improved security, anonymity and
so on. Therefore I'd like to use this one.
Unfortunally it seams not possible if one is either using the
Tor/Videla/Polipo bundle, as Tor/Videla will be already started then.
Rather it's also not possible if one is using Tor as a transparent proxy
or Vpn (JanusVM, TorVM...).
So if it won't be to much work I'd like to have a seperate version of Tor
Or as an alternative some instructions how to take it from there?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor transparent proxy implementation on Windows 
I am quite convinced of the transparent proxy approach. The concepts sound
very convincing. [1] [2]
A few old projects do still popup on Google. [3] [4] [5] But all of them
are outdated and insecure or the guest operating system is Linux [5]. Even
worse, for the Tor Windows transparent proxy implementations [3] [4] I
couldn't find any instructions how to build them manually.
I searched Google quite a lot and found nothing useful so far. A VPN
connection to Tor would (like [4]) be nice or a Tor user account under
which everything will be forced through Tor [3] as well.
Can you point me or post please some instructions how to build a Tor
transparent proxy environment for Windows? (Windows host, Windows guest)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor VPN Server selfmade 
Thank you for checking!
You were right. The minimal Ubuntu Server install hasn't done this.
That looks simpler. Unfortunately it's not that easy. Not all IP ranges
may be used in VMware. Only IPs listed under Virtual Network Editor, DHCP
do work, others are not routable. Might be possible to change this but I
thought not to change VMware is the least of the worse.
Yes, this is fortunately not the case.
I am sorry for that. I was hoping for some collaboration, community work.
Good idea.
