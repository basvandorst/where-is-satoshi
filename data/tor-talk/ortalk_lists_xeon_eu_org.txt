@_subject: 0.0.9.3 and hidden services 
Is 0.0.9.3 really making "hidden services less unbearable" for anyone
else? :)
I seem to started having problems since about slashdot picked up tor.  I
presume it's harder for the hidden rendezvous to pick the same routers
on both side when there are more hosts.  Until a few days ago, it got so
bad, that after a restart of a host (or update of tor version), I needed
to wait about half an hour before the restarted hidden host were visible
again (most of the time, without IP changes at all!).  Now, with
0.0.9.3, it got so bad, I have to try for hours to see a successful
connect to a hidden service, even if it's presumably such a stable host
as b19s.org hidden node.
Am I delusional or someone is out to get me? :)

Ok, I'm well trained in patience now :)  Thanks for the care!
Dubrovnik, now that's a nice place and quite far away...
I see the paper progressing in CVS (which may be not in accordance with
the distribution terms mentioned on the conference page, BTW).  I'd like
to mention a few words about my opinion in the bittorrent/wikipedia
discussion (but hopefully not restart it! :).  So, there may be a few
technical measures to invent to thwart abusers, but limiting privacy to
those "worthy" for it is always a political problem, comparable to
censorship, and makes the sleeping privacy activist in me unhappy (cue
Rev. Martin Niemoller here).
It's interesting to think if humanity will ever be so advanced as to not
needing privacy enhancement techniques to grant privacy for anyone, or
if we will always need some of us depending on Tor-like networks to
hinder the less-noble...

Ooh, I forgot to post it here since I got subscribed..  I solve the
google problem by visiting:
  Actually, I got into this habit when google localized in our country
too, and started forcing me to local domains, languages, etc :)
Of course that's nicer perl than I've hacked together instead of fighting
with privoxy :)
