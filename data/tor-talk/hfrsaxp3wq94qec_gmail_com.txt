I've read the FAQs, Wikis, related information on official and
external sites, discussions on the web and groups. My beginner
questions are as follows. Please humor me, I'm new. I'm running Tor as

7. Often when I am loading several web pages in tabs with Tor,
everything will come to a stop, and websites appear to hang without
loading until I stop and reload, or a Privoxy error page shows saying
it could not be resolved. Should I only load one page at a time with
