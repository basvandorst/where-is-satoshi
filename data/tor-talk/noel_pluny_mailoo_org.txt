I have only a little experience like system admin but I would like to set up an
anonymizing middlebox for a subnet; so I was reading the page
 but I can not
understand the funziont of the VirtualAddrNetwork option - it is not related to
the address of the subnet, right? It is only a functional address?
Also, I found in previous page the indication for the TransListenAddress option
but in man page of my tor (0.2.3.19-rc) it is marked as DEPRECATED: does the
page in the wiki need an upgrade?

This is exactly what I am trying to do.
In my idea this is not compulsory but could be an add on.
Yes, I would like to help.

Ok, I think to understand.
I read these articles but at this time I don't think they will apply to my
situation because this is a "friendly" one. We need only a way not to need to
save logs.
Thnaks the same.

Sorry for the delay but it is august.....
I don't really need a captive portal because I can talk by mouth to every user
of our access point. It is more clear?
What we are looking for is a way to loose every link between _every_ user of our
access point and the communication log, not forcing every user to install tor on
single device connected.
Yes, I used wrong words but sorry for my bad english.
