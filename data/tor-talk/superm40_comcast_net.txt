Speaking as a Wikipedia editor, this is a good idea in theory.  There would need to be a separate service for each language, just as there is a separate version of Wikipedia.  One important issue is copyright.  It is necessary to ensure that you comply with the terms of the GFDL and avoid copyright infringement.  The easiest way to do so is to clearly inform users of the "Wikipedia-proxy" service that contributions are released into the public domain.  This means you are free to post them to Wikipedia (or anywhere else...).  If this is unacceptable, you can let them post under the GFDL.  However, this creates attribution problems, so the public domain is better.  Another issue is that this will be a magnet for vandalism.  There will undoubtedly be constructive contributions, but also a mountain of spam.  Volunteers (and Wikipedia will not provide them) will have the review all the content; unlike pages on Wikipedia, they know that no one will read it until they are one.  Thus, it seems like dreary, hopelessly tedious work.  However, Wikipedia policies are not opposed to it, provided copyright issues are -Matthew Flaschen

As I said, I'm not going to do this.  But for anyone that does: You're right that some countries don't technically allow PD release (US included).  However, if someone saw a notice that they were doing so, it would be very difficult to sue the service later.  Just in case, the notice could add that if public domain release is impossible, you "irrevocably grant all your rights to it, including the rights of reproduction, distribution, transmission, use, and modification." (based on the text Wikipedia uses for this purpose). However, the lawsuit would be especially difficult considering the plantiff would have to prove they were the anonymous user who wrote it, which is theoretically very difficult if they're using Tor.  Similarly, they should be attributed simply as an anonymous Tor user, which is all the service operator knows

To the best of my knowledge, we've never blocked an entire ISP, largely because it is difficult to determine all the relevant IP ranges. However, when large range blocks are done, that may block an entire ISP or organization.  I would also note that ISPs have been very unresponsive to our abuse compliants.
You're right that he has made edits to the page.  Some have made himself look better while others have been neutral factual edits (see  for a record of all edits to the page). However, he now expressed regret for making any edits. More importantly, he made those edits from his established account, with no attempt to hide his identity.  It is wrong to imply he was trying to be secretive.
