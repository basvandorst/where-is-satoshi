Well, you could argue the same point about tails, or the tor software
itself. Somewhere you have the draw the line about paranoia. Unless you
are prepared to build everything yourself (and even then, as

"Most users would give up on Tor entirely if a website they want to use
requires JavaScript [and thus fails to render pages correctly because of
the default TBB settings], because they would not know how to allow a
website to use JavaScript (or that enabling JavaScript might make a
website work). (Additions in [] )

I'm sorry Gordon but I think this needs to be said. On a list devoted
to tor, recommending a VPN is not ideal. Whilst a commercial VPN might
buy you a geo specific location, at best it buys you /very/ limited
anonymity and privacy.
But, yes, if all you are concerned about is (say) a US IP so that you
can view Hulu, it might be acceptable. It depends upon your use case.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Appearing American 
I'd say yes, with caveats. Using a VPN implies divulging some
personal identifier(s) to the VPN provider at the least. You do not
need to do that when you use tor. However, tor usage flags you as
someone who cares a lot about personal privacy and anonymity. That in
itself can draw attention to you. (The old "what have you got to hide?"
chestnut.) Of course VPN usage can imply much the same, but for the
reason I gave above, it looks less likely.
The tor FAQ (at ../docs/faq.html) recommends against limiting entry
and/or exit to specific locations on the grounds that it can "mess up
your anonymity in ways that we don't understand." If the tor builders
themselves profess not to understand the implications, then I'd be
inclined to trust their recommendation against it.

It doesn't /have/ to be that way, but it is much more convenient (and
useful to a much larger population) if it is structured that way.
Arguably tor-talk (and/or other tor related lists) could be hosted on a
hidden service, encrypyted (by a key trusted by a large group - which in
itself is non-trivial to manage). But why? Usage of tor is not in
itself illegal in the US (or in many other jurisdictions). Tor's
designers and the relay operators (I am one) all want to see tor
widely used so why hide discussion about it? Having a publicly readable
archive of such discussion allows anyone interested in tor to follow
earlier discussions and make up their own minds about whether they
would wish to use tor. Hiding discussion would deny interested parties
that right and would end up in futile "choir preaching".

Hi Matt
No problem. However, whilst we do have the beginnings of very intrusive
network censorship in the UK (some ISPs are more pliable than others
when leaned on) we do not /yet/ have what you could call a a pan UK
firewall on the lines of that seen in more (ahem) repressive regimes.
It is interesting that UK users should be approaching the Tor help desk
for advice, and "use Tor" is certainly good advice. But you could
equally say "change your ISP to one with some balls". UK users should
stay away from the majors (BT, Virgin, talk-talk, O2, Sky, EE etc) and
use one of the multiple independents. BT in particular has a very bad
track record (see "phorm") whilst the likes of AAISP are truly
If enough UK users vote with their wallets, ISPs may be more inclined
to grow a pair. Unfortunately, the general UK reaction to the Snowden
revelations seem only to prove how apathetic UK users really are.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What are some free and private email providers? 
Johnny Carson Huh? I don't follow that at all. I can see you connecting to bitmessage.ch over Tor, but, how on earth do
you expect to get the bitmessage server to route a message to an
external recipient's MTA over the net, through a VPN back to
bitmessage.ch then back out over the net to a clearnet MTA? Whatever. The problem remains that if the clearnet MTA subscribes to an
RBL system (or has other blacklisting in place) it may simply refuse to
talk to a server identified as a Tor node, (or indeed to a system
identified as "mail.bitmessage.ch"). And there is nothing you can do
about that in advance.
SMTP was never designed with privacy or anonymity in mind. It is
iredeemably broken for that purpose. So any and all attempts at making
a hybrid system which /may/ work within an anonymising network such as
Tor, will almost certainly face problems when attempting to connect to
clearnet systems. The gateways between the two systems have to be
indentified. If they are identified, they can be blocked.
There are good reasons why the default torrc exit policy blocks port
25.

I agree that BT's domestic IP service is appalling. (If you are at all
interested you can read my experience with them back at the end of 2006
at  )
But just because BT owns the infrastructure does not mean that you must
use their IP service. "Unbundled" service providers aside, the
majority of UK ISPs deliver their domestic service over BT lines (and
almost all of them bar the largest will use BT's backbone ATM service).
You can take a service from any one of hundreds of smaller independent
ISPs. Whilst this means, of course, that BT has intrusive capability at
several points in the network, by taking an IP service from a good
independent that does not apply "family filters", or block or shape
certain services (e.g. torrents) you may have a much better experience.
Certainly I think it more likely that the independents are going to
remain Tor friendly longer than BT or the other large providers.
Personally I use vispa.net - purely by accident since they bought out
service from an earlier small supplier I moved to when I left BT. They
are one of a diminishing band of providers who give domestic customers a
fixed IPV4 address (essential to my way of working). But if I were to
move, I would go to andrews and arnold (aaisp.net  -see for example
 ). The owner of that ISP writes a wonderfully
irreverent blog at  For one of the reasons his
company is popular, see
 and
 That is outrageous. But I agree that mobile IP services are way too
expensive (and unreliable and they suffer from the problem of NAT
to the device). Unfortunately too many people are ditching their
landlines thinking that they no longer need them these days.
See above. I'd be inclind to give AAISP a call. They are smart people
and obviously Tor firendly.   Good luck

There are so many things wrong with this thesis that it is difficult
to know where to start. There is the obvious point that there is no
entity called "Tor" who can know anything about anything. There is only
a community of developers, researchers, system administrators, relay
operators etc, some of whom are known well (or partly) to others. So
there is no entity "Tor" which can undertake your "checks".
Nor is Tor just a set of software, processes and infrastructure. It is a
disparate community of people who place (varying) degrees of trust in
other people. Users trust that the software does what is supposed to
do, that the developers know what they are doing, that there are no
exploitable (deliberate or accidental) flaws in either the software
or the architectural model. And yes, they trust relay operators to
provide "safe passage".
To suggest that some (who?) set of the Tor community should subject
some other part of the community to some form of vetting which
includes (your words) "(regular, repeated) extensive personal
interviews, background checks, giving polygraph tests, injecting sodium
pentathol" is offensive in the extreme.

I think that might cause a few problems. Firstly, the obvious one of
definitions. Define "safe". Who gets to decide whch sites are OK to
cache and whch aren't. Definitions will vary according to the user's
location and the regime under which s/he lives (or the location or
regime under which the owner/operator of the relay lives.
Secondly, by caching (and thus later serving) data the relay ceases to
be just a neutral "common carrier" and moves into the realm of
hosting provider. I see lots of room for lawyers to get fat(ter) on the
back of legal argument about whether a relay providing a cached copy of
a document can be sued (for whatever reason). Look at the stupid
situation we already have where sites simply pointing to torrent
sites are taken down (while of course Google, which has fat lawyers,
doesn't get taken down).
Thirdly, the simple act of serving a copy from cache, rather than
transparently passing the request out to the end server, means that
the relay by definition is now intercepting Tor traffic (even if
only to "help" the end user).
Fourthly, the end user might not /want/ Tor to "help" in this way
(I wouldn't). What guarantee do I have that the Tor relay is giving
me exactly what I wanted and not some "tampered" copy. How can I
really trust a supposedly anonymous network which I now know to be
looking into my requests with a view to giving me a "better" or
"faster" service.   And how would I cope with SSL?

The mirrors are (of necessity) public servers. They contain copies of
the signature files. Inevitably those files will be retrieved at
times. It is possible that some of those retrievals are by search
engines or other 'bots trawling the web. But it is equally possible
that some of the retrievals will have been made by real people -
possibly people who simply wanted to get and compare signatures from
different sources.
The only certain way to ensure that there are no signature downloads
from the mirrors (and this applies to tails as well) is to remove
those signatures from the rsynch masters. If they ain't there, they
can't be copied to the mirrors.

And in the case of this specific extension it might be particularly
unwise. I haven't used this for a while, but ISTR that when I last
tried it it appeared to call home when in use. Others may be able to
confirm/deny this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Terminology: Deep v Dark Web 
Katya's wiki page nicely encapsulates some the definitions, but I
think the definition of "deep web" might benefit from some tweaking to
take account of such commentary as Sergey Brin's lament back in april
2012 (1)
According to the article referenced. Brin complained that Apple and
Facebook's networks were effectively "dark" to Google since he
couldn't search those walled gardens. I don't think many people would
consider such sites as part of the "deep web", let alone "dark web",
but if Brin is to be taken seriously, then it might be worthwhile
pointing this out. Facebook alone is vast. Including that as an
example of "deep web" might add some context to the discussion. After
all, the claim that the "deep web" is some 500 times the size of the
open public internet dates from 2001. Somehow that statistic doesn't
feel right to me.

And of course you will get a similar warning when connecting to a site
which uses a self signed certificate. Whether you trust that site
depends on your use case and trust model.
Personally I think the CA model is largely broken. I make my own
choices about whether to trust a site. Hell, most people are perfectly
happy to connect to /any/ site without SSL/TLS. Why complain about a
site which offers encryption, but doesn't conform to the wider CA

@_subject: [tor-talk] how many verify their tbb ? 
Is it safe to assume that a high proportion of those actually
bothering to download the .asc will then go on to verify? If not, why
would they bother to download?
I have just checked on my tails mirror and I get the slightly
depressing results below:
cat tails.log.1 | grep tails-i386-1.1.iso | grep -v .sig | sort -t. +0
-3 -u | wc -l
cat tails.log.1 | grep tails-i386-1.1.iso.sig | sort -t. +0 -3 -u | wc
which I make 0.68%
Note that I have used a different approach to Andrew because I think
his approach will overestimate the number of file retrievals. Certainly
in my logs I see multiple parallel connections from the same IP
address (with resulting HTTP status code 206 for partial content). My
sort above should strip those out. If I use Andrew's approach and do
not strip the multiple connections from the same address I get the
even more depressing results below:
cat tails.log.1 | grep tails-i386-1.1.iso | grep -v .sig | wc -l
which would give only 0.15% bothering to check the signature.
(Of course, since many connections to my mirror may come over Tor my
sort will remove any which happen to pop out of the same exit - so the
approach is far from perfect. That said, my awstats runs show answers
consistent with the approach I have used.)

And a similar check on my whonix mirror gives 1.39% requesting the
signature file for the gateway and 0.86% for the workstation. So -
equally depressing.
It would seem that there are an awful lot of very trusting people out

Doh! Sorry, I had completely missed that. The downloads of ~ 30,000 per month look a lot healthier. But it begs

Agreed he isn't winning many friends. But I think a threat of removing
him from the list (and thus removing his right to air his views) is both
wrong and ironic given that Tor is supposed to facilitate free speech.
Others on the list can choose whether or not to argue with him.

Interesting point. In many, if not most, countries the very act of
accessing such material is illegal. Yet, McCarron, in his post of 25
June, admitted on this public email list that he now had difficulty
accessing "the more serious categories, such as child porn and
violent sexual material".
That strikes me as stupid. Certainly it is not "low key" as you say.

With respect, I think there is a big difference between the
inclusion of YT video on a personal blog and its use in a website
promoting "Anonymous P2P inside browsers ... encrypted and untrackable"
and promoted (by you) on a mail list dedicated to Tor usage.
And there /are/ alternatives to YT if you are building your own promo.

To the OP (and others who may wish to try something similar) my strong
advice is "don't, just don't". I've been a network admin and sysadmin
on corporate systems. Unauthorised traffic on such a network /will/
attract attention, /will/ piss off the admins and almost /certainly

dismissal depending upon the terms of your contract.

Thank you once again Grarpamp. You may be OTT occasionally, but
nevertheless it is worth reminding people that security is not an
absolute. We all make assumptions about who, or what is trustworthy
and in what context. But those assumptions should always take account of
our own particular threat models. Best

Actually, that's not quite right. In an ideal world Tor browser (and
Tor itself) should not /need/ to exist. Unfortunately we do not live in
that ideal world.
Those "old white men" did the job they were supposed to do at the time
they were supposed to do it. And in this (old, white) man's view they
did a pretty good job. But as I say, unfortunately the world is not the
same now. I'd guess that if packet switched networking were being
invented now we might be seeing a rather different beast to the IP
stack we currently all know and love. :-)

In the UK we are truly blessed. Home Office Ministers in general are
not overly intelligent. I'm not entirely sure they are that way
before they get to the HO, or the HO makes them that way after they take
office. Either way they end up spouting dangerously delusional rubbish
