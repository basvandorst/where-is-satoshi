Hey folks!
I am an OSX tor router operator.  Today I had to restore the /Library/ Tor directory from my backup, and though I made sure all the file  permissions were right, including the key files, I get this when I  launch it;

And I cannot connect to anything via the client side of things.
However, when I revert to the client-only mode, I can connect just fine.
Any ideas?

Just a question or two, Jimbo...
Do you folks block all proxies?  Like anonymization.net and  If all proxies are to be blocked, how is somebody with sensitive  whistleblower-type information to be able to post it?
As an example, 20 years ago I worked for a nuclear utility that was  lying to the NRC about safety-related systems.  Had the web and  Wikipedia existed then, and had I wanted to post information about  this to a page about that nuclear utility, how could I have done this  anonymously?  The consequences of not doing this anonymously would  have been firing at a minimum and prosecution would have been a  distinct possibility.  IMNSHO, there HAS to be a means for  whistleblowers to achieve some safety if we want to encourage the  practice, and, as a civilization, I believe we do want to encourage it.
How does Wikipedia deal with large groups with NAT firewalls?  The  defacers of the page about me on Wikipedia were all from Ball State  University, from a NAT address.  Assuming the users from a particular  college were largely defacers (and I am not alleging that is the case  here, I am just asking about policy) would that whole domain get

Paul & Jimbo, et al,
The biggest problem I see is that if moderation is commissive, rather  than reactive, then if the original poster commits a crime (like  violating the Official Secrets Act) then the moderator who approves  the posting would likely be liable for the same crime.
This is not helped by putting the moderator in a different  jurisdiction from the poster, because some government, like the  United States, do not recognize that their jurisdiction ends at their  national boundaries, and reserve the right to rendition (aka  kidnapping) even where the national government that the moderator  resides in would never agree to a formal extradition.
The only solution I can think of that would allow Tor and Wiki to  interoperate would be to have a Tor-Wikipedia Moderation Team who  would actively look for Wikipedia vandalism originating from Tor exit  nodes, and revert out vandal's postings promptly.
The support we would need from Wikipedia would be minor;  Wiki would  have to implement a Watch function for postings from Tor exit nodes  that the Tor-Wikipedia moderation team would get email notifications  on.  There already are exit node listings that would allow Wikipedia  to create and refresh this list on a regular basis, and obviously  they can already do that as they have implemented a block.  Wikipedia  would have to agree that the Tor-Wikipedia Moderation Team would have  the right to revert ANY change from a Tor exit node without  discussion.  Once the vandals realize that they won't have any fun  using Tor to vandalize Wikipedia, the job of the TWMT would get quite  easy, as I don't imagine there would be more than a few dozen real  edits on any given day from the Tor cloud.
Or am I barking up the wrong tree here?

I would too, but I wouldn't want to put anybody else into that  position.  If you look at my web site you will see that my neck is on  the block if the fascists ever unmask, anyway;  http:// But the idea I propose of reactive moderation by a volunteer team  committed to Tor getting alerts for all Tor-cloud postings to Wiki  would not put anybody in the position of having to affirmatively  approve anything, and I am much more willing to suggest that others  volunteer to do that.

Can you put some numbers on the magnitude of the problem that  happened before Tor was blocked?
