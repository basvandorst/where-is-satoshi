@_subject: 0.2.14 unable to establish encrypted directory connection 
I recently tried upgrading Tor 0.2.13-alpha (which occasionally crashed
on startup) to 0.2.14-alpha. While 0.2.14-alpha no longer crashes, it
also fails to connect to Tor :-(
The error-message is
"[Warning] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 15%: Establishing an
encrypted directory connection. (Socket is not connected [WSAENOTCONN ];
NOROUTE; count 1; recommendation warn)"
I'm a bit a loss as to why I'm receiving this message. Clues would be
welcome :-)
Kind Regards,
Sander Holthaus
