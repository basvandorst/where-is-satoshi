Is there any attack vector by allowing this feature? (it is on by default)
I've read articles on malware replacing or altering [graphics card(s)]
firmware and since Tor users shouldn't use Flash [though some use HTML5 -
could this be abused by itself and/or with the H.A. feature discussed
here?] what are the pro vs. con to leaving this feature enabled vs.
disabling it?

"This has been a known "trivial" bug since 2006. Looking it over, it
appears that the security benefit of being able to reduce ones browser's
attack surface might have been overlooked. Or perhaps we've missed
The best way to get something done about this would be to create a
Bugzilla account and explain the necessity (don't nag - just explain the
need and the impications which seem to have been missed)
The bug is 331257. While you're there you might also be interested in

vicious bug which should be patched."
:: Firefox, Opera allow crooks to hide an entire phish site in a link
:: :: "Watch out for the tinyurl that isn't
::  By John Leyden | Security | 11/03/2012
"A shortcoming in browsers including Firefox and Opera allows crooks to
easily hide an entire malicious web page in a clickable link - ideal for
fooling victims into handing over passwords and other sensitive info.
Usually, so-called "phishing attacks" rely on tricking marks into visiting
websites designed by criminals to masquerade as banks and online stores,
thus snaffling punters' credentials and bank account details when they try
to use the bogus pages. However this requires finding somewhere to host
the counterfeit sites, which are often quickly taken down by hosting
companies and the authorities or blocked by filters.
Instead, the malicious web pages can be stored in data URIs - uniform
resource identifiers, not to be confused with URLs - which stuff the web
code into a handy string that when clicked on, instructs the browser to
unpack the payload and present it as a page.
It negates the need to find somewhere to secrete your malicious page, and
once shortened using a service such as TinyURL, the URI can be reduced to
a small URL perfect for passing around social networks, online chats and
email. Crooks may need to set up a server to receive data from victims,
It's a technique already documented by researchers Billy Rios and Nathan
McFeters - but now Henning Klevjer, an information security student at the
University of Oslo in Norway, has revisited the attack method in his
paper, Phishing by data URI [PDF].
Typically an attacker would first create a standalone web page, probably
using content scraped off the legitimate site it seeks to mimic before
making an encoded page and embedding it into a data URI.
URI-based attacks were previously documented by Rios and McFeters as part
of an attack Microsoft?s Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Klevjer's research
expands on this basic theme and gives it a modern twist.
Google?s Chrome browser blocks redirection to data URIs, and other
browsers have limits on the volume of data that can be packed into URIs.
Klevjer created a 26KB attack page that failed to load in Internet
Explorer, but worked on both Firefox and Opera.
As well as getting around the need to find a home for malicious web pages,
the data URI trick can sidestep traditional scam defences, such as web
filtering. Data URIs may also contain a potentially malicious Java applet,
a major concern following last week's Java-related security flap, a post
on Sophos's Naked Security blog notes."
Thank you for the bug report pages, this one appears to have a lot of
This appears to be a SERIOUS HOLE in FF/IW to me!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia Network Map list blank 
Tails 0.16 - Vidalia relays list is blank at start and with continued use
without a refresh.
Bug is identical in previous versions.
Functions without refreshing the list but with some errors in the circuit
build area.
I click refresh.
Vidalia loads relay list - around 3000 relays.
Circuits are rebuilt without errors.
What effect does it have if I run Tor without refreshing the list in Vidalia?
What effect does it have if I run Tor following refreshing of the list?
Why does Vidalia perform in this way on startup?

Look at this:
[notice] No AES engine found; using AES_* functions.
[notice] This version of OpenSSL has a slow implementation of counter
mode; not using it.
[notice] OpenSSL OpenSSL 0.9.8o 01 Jun 2010 looks like version 0.9.8m or
later; I will try SSL_OP to enable renegotiation
[notice] We weren't able to find support for all of the TLS ciphersuites
that we wanted to advertise. This won't hurt security, but it might make
your Tor (if run as a client) more easy for censors to block.
[notice] To correct this, use a more recent OpenSSL, built without
disabling any secure ciphers or features.
Someone explain this please. This coming from the distro which still uses:
network-manager 0.8.1-6+squeeze2
network-manager-gnome 0.8.1-2
