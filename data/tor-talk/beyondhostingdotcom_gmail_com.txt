@_subject: [tor-talk] LeaseWeb disconnects Tor exit node for forum "spam" 
I just thought I would notify the list that leaseweb is not a safe place to
host a Tor exit node.
Occasionally I would get a complaint from leaseweb but it would be marked
as priority "normal" (basically meaning its informational only and you
don't have to reply to it) but recently they are now null routing the
My node was running for about 8 months without any real problems.
Now it seems leaseweb has subscribed to lists from stop forum spam and
project honeypot and is not accepting Tor as an explanation.
I thought I was safe from complaints by only allowing http/https ports so
no p2p so I am curious if any other exit node operators had to deal with
this problem with forum spam.
This was a surprise to be treated like this by leaseweb which I am a large
customer with many servers and I have heard only good things about how they
stand up for their customers and don't respond to DMCA's and such.
Does anyone have any ideas how to prevent this or a better strategy for
responding to these type of complaints?
Also does anyone know if forum spam is really illegal under dutch law?
I was almost going to hire a lawyer since they pissed me off and it seems
quite clear that there is nothing in their contract that prohibits this but
I do not want to make an issue of it and have them cancel my entire service
since my business is based around leaseweb servers and there is no real
alternative at their price/bandwidth level.
I have included my full exchange with them below.
from me.
per month.
see the complaint at the bottom of this e-mail. We urge you to take
appropriate action to prevent future complaints.
SO WILL RESULT IN AN IP BLOCK OF THE MENTIONED IP.
