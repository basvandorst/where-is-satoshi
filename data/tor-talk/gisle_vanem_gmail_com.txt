@_subject: [tor-talk] What is "a.onion"? 
Trying the C-ares [1] program adig on some .onion addresses
on my local Tor/Windows, I get responses like (short output):
c:\>  adig -t A a.onion
         a.onion        .        60      A       127.247.163.198
Or c:\> adig -t A b.onion
         b.onion        .        60      A       127.207.1.12
What are these 127.a.b.c.d addresses and their relations to
'a' and 'b'?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unhandled OpenSSL errors 
I've been running Tor successfully on my main
PC for several years. Now, after trying Tor on another
machine (only a slow Intel Atom CPU), I get lots of these
error in the log:
   Oct 12 07:40:02.000 [warn] Unhandled OpenSSL errors found at buffers_tls.c:69:
   Oct 12 07:40:02.000 [warn] TLS error: internal error (in SSL routines:tls13_hkdf_expand:---)
   Oct 12 07:40:02.000 [warn] TLS error: internal error (in SSL routines:tls13_hkdf_expand:---)
The last is always duplicated. And these also appear after the:
   Self-testing indicates your DirPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent.
Anybody recognize them and what the cause could be?
These also causes entries in my Windows event-log. Seems the
OpenSSL function SSLfatal() does that via some BIO-log call.
