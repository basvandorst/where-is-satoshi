@_subject: [tor-talk] passive analysis of encrypted traffic and traffic 
Hi tor guys,
encrypted traffic analysis is an analysis apply to an encrypted session
in order not to disclose the protected data, but to detect the protocol
the IRAN attack in TOR was, more or less, an attack like them. (more or
less because was based on the HTTPS pattern, not in an analysis based on
packets size and packets timing, anyway this is one possible next step
in this challenge).
anyway, yesterday has been released a tool (SniffJoke:
 transparently scramble the traffic
outgoing from a Linux box and making nasty to be analyzed by a sniffer
or other passive wiretapping tool.
If someone interested in TOR deply, would:
1) try a blocked TOR version in IRAN, to verify if the session is
protected from the anti-TOR tech
2) study a scrambling pattern, I will develop a specific sniffjoke
plugin to protect eventually escalation in passive analysis from the
3) tests sniffjoke as additional protection in an exit node, protecting
from passive analysis the anonymized traffic
4) any other ideas :)
I want to offer my supports

I belive (or i hope, only the research will make a definitive answer)
Not. because sniffjoke use only plausible packets in the network,
exploiting the "ambiguity" that every sniffer found to face, when choose
if accept a packets or not as part of the streams under tracking.
so there are not a pattern of "fake packets", also because all the
"good" packets are modified too expecting to confound statistical analysis.
sorry, my documentations really sucks :) anyway the evening I've drank a
lot of yerba mate, and the sleep deprivation has results in a totally
new amount of contents.
in logic order:
p.s. sorry for my poor english, I wish the technical information will be
understandable beside the grammar damages :P
