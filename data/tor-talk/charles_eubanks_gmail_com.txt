@_subject: Can't connect to TOR from uverse 
I just installed TOR on OSX and I am trying to connect. My ISP is AT&T Uverse.
I never get past 10% "Establishing encrypted directory connection"
I do not have outbound ports blocked for 80 or 443
I have tried with and without ?setting bridges. and also with and
without restricted ports.
?Included is my log output.
Any clues for a total newbie?
