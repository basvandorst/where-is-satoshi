@_subject: Tor Browser Bundle for GNU/Linux 1.0.0 Released 
Just wanted to point out that maybe the Tor volunteer page should be updated
to reflect the fact that this is a 'completed' project.  It's still listed
as a good coding project for Google's 2010 Summer of Code.  Maybe at the
very least change it to "working beta has been released" so that any
applicants considering it know what they'd be getting into.
Thanks for the Linux Browser Bundle goodness.
