I do not see any need to share the source code if Olaf can easily
continue hosting it based on his own considerations. As far as I am
concerned hosting in Russia should not be an issue in any way.
Of course the source code would be very interesting but it is
basically up to Olaf.

As the Tor Relay software does not fully utilize multiple cores yet
the use of the parallel processing power is not that big. It might
help a bit but not as you would love to see it.
The choice is yours.
Beware though that running a Tor Relay from your home connection is
discouraged:

My bad, I should have explicitely mentioned exit indeed.

When you signed up all relay fingerprints with Tor Weather [1] you
should receive an e-mail once you earned yourself a t-shirt. Without
being subscribed to Tor Weather you do not get the e-mail you will
need to forward to the team sending the t-shirts.
There has been some delay in sending the t-shirts but as far as I know
the e-mail of Tor Weather is sent automatically without human action.

It is possible the "E-mail me when I earned a t-shirt" was not
selected on sign up or the sign up did not come through. Best would be
to sign them up again.
I do not know if Tor Weather looks at the time your relays are online
when e-mailing or actually uses the time they are monitored by Tor
Weather itself as measurement.
Thanks in advance. Kristoffer

Maybe someone of the Tor Project team can answer that. For me it would
only be guessing.
Thanks in advance. Kristoffer
