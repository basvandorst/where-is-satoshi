@_subject: [tor-talk] company devised process to disable Intel Management 
There have been public methods to disable Intel ME for a while now. (I don't have the links handy, but I did see both official "patches" and various other discussion threads, etc.)
I'm not sure if they workarounds are officially supported (i.e. those that disable Intel ME completely), and if they could brick your device, but there are public methods available.
Keep in mind that just because you have a laptop that uses an Intel processor, doesn't necessarily mean that you also have Intel ME enabled by default. I don't think my laptops support this feature unless I've missed something that someone can enlighten me about.
Best regards,

Interesting, do you have a proof of concept supporting that desktop PCs without remote administration such as AMT, can still be reached remotely via Intel ME?
Besides Intel ME there is also the AMD version, which people seem to forget about or even discuss.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Beware of insecure mobile Tor apps such as Orion/Torion 
A security advisory for the Orion/Torion iOS app has recently been released to the public.
The developer basically took Mike Tigas' iOS app and introduced several vulnerabilities to it that could be used to track users, and the developer also forgot to mention existing vulnerabilities that could also be used to identify users.
Last but not least it also contains several known issues in relation to the embedded Tor client and OpenSSL libraries.
The advisory has been attached to this email, and can also be found on the Full Disclosure mailing list and various other websites.

If you can use Tor bridges in China, then you can probably use Tor bridges in Russia :-)

The real question is, what are they going to spend that million on?
