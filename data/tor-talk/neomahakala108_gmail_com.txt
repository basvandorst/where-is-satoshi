i am an amateur hacker, but i wish to work in the Cyber Security in the EU
NATO Structure, probably in a small Company or a Corporation soon.
i've written an article about SSH Dictionary Hack over TOR, didn't check if
it works yet though (no time mostly).
i could use a constructive critic,
the article is there:
thanks in advance.

what do You (me at beroal.in.ua) mean by 'a formal definition of a hack'?
if You mean formal as strict code, then yes ... i'll provide working script
later - probably in the same article (will reedit if needed).
i think also that 'a hack definition' is 'something not done according with
design' (non-idiomatic coding), as well as 'a certain mindset', 'computer
takeover or disabling', perhaps more.
