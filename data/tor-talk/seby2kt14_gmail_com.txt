Wow. Thanks. GreyPony is so amazing, unlike anything I've ever seen before.
Could I tattoo it on my neck? Keep on going!!
I suggest to Tor project to change the logo and write under the onion logo
"powered by GreyPony". Wow
Is amazing. Running 2 relays. The king of onionland Conrad. Thanks for this
you are amazing.

GreyPony Consultants / Con(rad) now also runs a bridge at DigitalOcean.
It is not just any bridge, it is an obfs4 bridge. It also has IPv6 enabled.
All you mortals acknowledge.

This dude just won't stop harassing us with masked advertising, commercial
offers and monetary asks. Every time even the most boring thing needs to be
publicly shouted on these mail lists, every time he does something
extraordinary, something quite unusual that none of you mortals could ever
do like running a middle relay on a small virtual machine, or a 500KB/s
