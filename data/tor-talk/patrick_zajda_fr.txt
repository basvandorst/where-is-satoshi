Hi all,
I want to set an obfuscated bridge on my Raspberry Pi.
When I do sudo apt-get source obfsproxy apt notices me it needs
python-pyptlib which cannot be found.
How can I install python-pyptlib on Raspbian?
I know python-pyptlib is available on backports, but no backports exist
for Raspbian.

OK, thanks for clarifying this.
So on a Raspberry Pi Tor has to be compiled (using apt-get source tor
etc), and obfsproxy can be installed using sudo apt-get install obfsproxy.
I finally chose to use pip install obfsproxy even if installing it
using sudo apt-get install obfsproxy is easier and quicker, to have
scramblesuit features.
I did:
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install obfsproxy --upgrade
And set my torc file successfully.
Thanks all for your help,

Oops, thank you.
I re-compiled tor from the repos indicated by Lunar on tor-relays
list: tor-nightly-master-wheezy main
No I have Tor version 0.2.5.1-alpha-dev (git-2c0088b8aa360c8d+96972c4).
Now everything should be good, unless I missed another information :)

Hi all,
I have a rooted Nexus 5 with Android 4.4.2.
If I enable the transparent proxy for Wi-fi and USB, I cannot use Tor
anymore from others apps on the phone.
Is tor disabled for others connections than wi-fi and USB when
tethering Tor is enabled?
Or is it because it tryes to use wi-fi to connect so I should only use
other connection than wi-fi?
I though I could enable this option and use Tor as usual with the
phone too. But maybe I made a bad supposition?

I asked them by opening a support ticket ans I hadn't the same answer.
The person who replied just noticed me to be prepared in the case of
investigation, not instating me not to do it.
For relay, he told me there were no problem, still better than OVH who
stop servers for strange reasons, don't allow any tor, but if we look at
French spam/fishing headers, they come from OVH and they take a long
time to treat abuse requests ;)
I have set a relay on my Dedibox without any problem for some months now.

It blocks all traffic.
For example, check.torproject.org doesn't work at all, no connection
is established.
So I'll disable it and re-enable it when really necessary and will use
3G for others apps when it is enabled.
I'll be happy to test if if you want some testers on Android 4.4.
Thanks for your answer,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unable to set master password in tor browser 
Hi all,
I am blind and have to use a Firefox module to solve captchas.
The problem is as follow: to use it, I have an account and have to use
Firefox password reccording to log me in to this service.
I though it was optional to set a master password, but it seems it is
not the case with the Tor Browser because when I want to log me in, I
have the dialog box to set my password.
But when I try to set it, when I type it, confirm it then click OK, I
have a dialog box indicating the password couldn't be set.
If I press Cancel, I cannot log in.
Is it a known bug? Is there a solution?
Thanks in advance for the help.

Hi Matt,
Thanks for your answer.
I suppose there is an opened ticket about this, do you have the address?
Else I'll look for it latter.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser language 
Yesterday I had Tor Browser updated to 5.0.3.
Since this version, my Firefox interface is in English.
I agree to ask for English only when getting a web page, but how can I
have Firefox on Tor Browser interface back in my language?
Tor Browser settings (for security and tor) are still in French, only
Firefox is in English now.
Thanks and best regards.

Hi again,
Strange, the interface has switched back to my language by itself...
Does someone have the same problem?
I am on Windows 7 64-bits.
