@_subject: [tor-talk] observed bandwidth too low 
Did you get to the bottom of this? I'm in the same situation: after
cranking up the bandwidth, the effect rather seemed to be the opposite.
Here's the relevant config
   RelayBandwidthRate 1000 KBytes  # Throttle traffic
   RelayBandwidthBurst 2000 KBytes # But allow bursts
but I'm listed for only 91 KB at The log shows no problems and I *did* restart my tor after changing
config :-)
