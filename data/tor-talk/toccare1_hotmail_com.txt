@_subject: [tor-talk] Problem with TOR-browser on iMac 
I have a new iMac and downloaded the TOR-browser without problems.
But when I try to establish a connection with the Web I get the following message:
CANNOT FIND THE PROXYSERVER
FIREFOX HAS BEEN CONFIGURED FOR USING A PROXYSERVER WHICH CAN NOT BEEN FOUND
CHECK YOUR PROXY CONFIGURATION
CHECK YOUR NETWORK =  IS OK!
IF YOUR COMPUTER OR NETWORK IS BEING PROTECTED BY A FIREWALL OR PROXY, BE SURE TO ALLOW THE TOR BROWSER ADMITTANCE TO THE WEB
I ALLOWED the FIREWALL for incoming communication with TOR browser.
Note: when I switch off the firewall, what is stupid ofcourse, I still can't establish connection with the Web.
Can anyone help me pse with this problem?
Many thanks in advance and my eternal gratitude!

@_subject: [tor-talk] manual proxy config 
I noticed that my Manual proxy in the TOR-browser is configured as follows:
SOCKS v5 host: 127.0.0.1 port: 9150
(DNS via proxy when using SOCKS v5 checked)
Is this safe and reliable?
Thanks in advance for your kind assistance!
