@_subject: Attempts to compromiseTOR servers running windows? 
My ISP's mail server is getting bombarded with the same garbage.  All the
messages I am getting are from "defang at localhost", and try to appear (very
poorly) from official email addresses like fbi at fbi.gov or
webmaster at hotmail.com and so on.  They all contain a .zip with an executable
and yes, you guessed it, the sober worm.  I am wondering if some idiot is
doing this intentionally or if a machine has become compromised.  The
messages I receive are not even addressed to me.  I am getting around 3 a
minute, and had thousands yesterday.  Outlook's junk filters are handling it
quite well I must say. -----Original Message-----

 When I set up tor I gave this yahoo address as a contact address. Just
before the thanksgiving holiday I noticed a lot of spam with a zipped file
containing the sober worm as an attachment. I have since received about
three thousand messages and Ive begun to notice a pattern. It seems that
these are addresses that come from tor contact addresses. I have also
received error messages (from Yahoo?) that indicate that mail that I never
sent from my yahoo account could not be sent. Any ideas?

@_subject: Tor for BartPe 
I guess the question is, does Privoxy or Tor need to write to any files, can
these files be written to in a RAM drive, or does BartPE create a temporary
folder on the HDD? If they do not write to any files during operation, or if they can write to
the needed files in a RAM drive, then you should be able to include them
quite easily using the BartPE maker. Set everything up with the default
settings, then copy the Tor and Privoxy directories along with the necessary
shortcuts over into the BartPE image.  If BartPE uses a temporary directory or file on the HDD, (which I don't
think it does) then Tor and Privoxy needs to be able to find those files.
Set everything up with the default settings, point Tor and privoxy to the
files they need, then copy the Tor and Privoxy directories over into the
BartPE image along with the shortcuts.
I think the PE creator actually has a setting to include a program.  If not,
it should be relatively simple to inject the shortcuts to start Tor and
Privoxy, and the actual program directories themselves using UltraISO or
comparable.  The network components are already there so that?s not a
problem. You might want to contact BartPE's author and ask him these

WASHINGTON DC -- To many privacy geeks, it's the holy grail -- a totally
anonymous and secure computer so easy to use you can hand it to your
grandmother and send her off on her own to the local Starbucks.
That was the guiding principle for the members of kaos.theory security
when they set out to put a secure crypto-heavy operating systems on a
bootable CD: a disk that would offer the masses the same level of privacy
available to security professionals, but with an easy user interface.
"If Granny's into trannies, and doesn't want her grandkids to know, she
should be able to download without fear," says Taylor Banks, project leader.
It's a difficult problem, entailing a great deal of attention to both
security details and usability issues. The group finally unveiled their
finished product at the Shmoo Con hacker conference here Saturday, with
mixed results.
Titled Anonym.OS, the system is a type of disk called a "live CD" -- meaning
it's a complete solution for using a computer without touching the hard
drive. Developers say Anonym.OS is likely the first live CD based on the
security-heavy OpenBSD operating system.
OpenBSD running in secure mode is relatively rare among desktop users. So to
keep from standing out, Anonym.OS leaves a deceptive network fingerprint. In
everything from the way it actively reports itself to other computers, to
matters of technical minutia such as TCP packet length, the system is
designed to look like Windows XP SP1. "We considered part of what makes a
system anonymous is looking like what is most popular, so you blend in with
the crowd," explains project developer Adam Bregenzer of Super Light
Booting the CD, you are presented with a text based wizard-style list of
questions to answer, one at a time, with defaults that will work for most
users. Within a few moments, a fairly naive user can be up and running and
connected to an open Wi-Fi point, if one is available.
Once you're running, you have a broad range of anonymity-protecting
applications at your disposal.
But actually using the system can be a slow experience. Anonym.OS makes
extensive use of Tor, the onion routing network that relies on an array of
servers passing encrypted traffic to permit untraceable surfing. Sadly, Tor
has recently suffered from user-base growth far outpacing the number of
servers available to those users -- at last count there were only 419
servers worldwide. So Tor lags badly at times of heavy use.
Between Tor's problems, and some nagging performance issues on the disk
itself, Banks concedes that the CD is not yet ready for the wide audience he
hopes to someday serve. "Is Grandma really going to be able to use it today?
I don't know. If she already uses the internet, yes."
Experts also say Anonym.OS may not solve the internet's most pressing
issues, such as the notorious China problem: repressive governments that
monitor their population's net access, and censor or jail citizens who speak
out against the government.
Ethan Zuckerman, fellow with Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and
Society, works extensively with international bloggers and journalists, many
of whom live under constant threat from their own governments. He see
Anonym.OS as a blessing for some -- but not for those at the greatest risk.
"I think it's going to be tremendously useful for fairly sophisticated users
when they are traveling, but where it may not be as effective as people
would hope is in counties where the government is really seriously about
locking down the net, constraining internet access," Zuckerman says.
Because most people in the developing world use the internet from shared
desktop environments, services for them have to consider office place and
cyber cafe-based computer situations. "Rebooting isn't often an option,"
explains Zuckerman, who would like to see anonymity solutions move toward
minimally invasive strategies like the TorPark, a USB key that allows access
to a Tor enabled browser without rebooting, and private proxies matched up
one by one with dissidents.
But kaos.theory members say Anonym.OS is just the first step in making
anonymity widely available. Future versions, they say, may run on a USB
keychain. Additionally, they plan to implement Enigmail to allow encrypted
e-mail for Thunderbird and Gaim Off The Record, which allows users to use
instant messaging without their logs being tied to them.
David Del Torto, chief security officer of the non-profit CryptoRights
group, says projects like Anonym.OS are heading in the right direction, but
thinks the project overreaches by trying to be useful to everyone. "Grandmas
are not the ones that need this right now.... My instincts tell me that it's
a very small number of people (that can use Anonym.OS). You can't really
solve this problem by simplifying the interface. It's almost impossible to
anticipate everything a user can do to hurt themselves."

It has come to our attention that the majority of tor users are not actually
from china but are rather malicious hackers that (ab)use it to keep their
anonymity. We have released a tool to stop users from utilizing this tool to
protect their identity from prosecution by a designated systems
administrator. Otherwise this puts the administrator in responsibility for
any malicious actions caused by said user. Forensics is left with a tor exit
node.                                                              Recently our servers were hacked by a tor user and we were unable to
prosecute due to not being able to trace the source as the user was using
this malicious piece of software to keep his/her anonymity. To mitigate most tor attackers we've written an apache module designed to
give tor users a 403 error when visiting a specific website.  We suggest all
administrators whom do not wish a malicious tor user to visit and possibly
deface their website to enable the usage of this module. This may not get
all attackers, but hopefully it raises the security bar just a little bit
more to safeguard ourselves from hackers.

I need to agree here.  I was skeptical also, but Vidalia is running fine,
with no bugs, and is more feature rich and complete.  Makes it much easier
to run a node and so forth.  Good job on including Vidalia, and I can't wait
to see improvements.  By the way, I am running WindowsXP SP2 and Vidalia,
like I said, no problems at all. Oh yeah, and Vidalia Onions are absolutely delicious :P  I can't believe he

Can you describe these bugs?  I run Windows XP Home and Vidalia v.0.0.4 has shown zero bugs so far.  TorCP
on the other hand was pretty buggy, especially when you used it to configure
a server (it crashed everytime).
See my statment above.
When Vidalia starts for the first time it reads your torrc and imports your
config settings into a new 'torrc' file it creates.  Your original torric is
now called 'torrc.orig.x' (where 'x' is most likly '1').  The new torrc file uses all the settings from your original torrc (which
were imported by Vidalia).  When you use Vidalia to cinfigure Tor (ie. to become a
server) Vidalia updates the torrc file it created with this new
configuration setting.  Registry keys are also used by Vidalia in Windows XP to save configuration
settings.  When you configure Vidalia two reg keys are updated (along with
the torrc).  These reg keys only contain configurations supported through
Vidalia (eg. no 'bandwith rate limiting', this would be in the torrc).
Vidalia seems to use these keys as a 'master' config setting and as a
'backup' for the torrc.  If the torrc uses the server nic "A" and the reg
keys use server nic "B" Vidalia will use server nic "B".
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\vidalia I am very happy with Vidalia and I like where it is going; v.0.0.5 looks good.  The creator of Vidalia is open to suggestions and feature requests.  I requested a feature in Vidalia that shows your private (local) and public (exit node) IP addresses when you mouse over the system tray icon.  Within an hour the author of Vidalia wrote to me and said he would impliment this in v.0.0.5.
Tor is not stable and will not be stable for a long
Hell, the first Tor GUI I uses was called "TorControl"
and then came "TorCP" and now "Vidalia".  I must say
with each succession the GUI's have progressed leaps
and bounds.  IMO Vidalia is a great GUI with alot of
potential and an author who is very motivated. Vidalia is an onion.  Tor is a client/server program
which uses the Onoin Route II to anonymize/secure The connection lies in that Vidalia is an onion and Vidalia is used to control Tor which utilizes the
Onion Route II.

SwitchProxy lets you manage and switch between *multiple proxy

protect your computer from prying eyes.
That sounds cool, because you can have just additional proxy configuration.
I mean - TorButton should ensure that user's current proxy configuration
won't be overridden.

@_subject: (FWD) Re: Update: Torbutton 1.0.1 
Hey that's not a bad feature request!  A configurable start Tor option!  I
use the Tor/Privoxy bundle, so the button would need to start TorCP(which
starts Tor) and start Privoxy.  Others may want to just start Tor, or maybe
just TorCP, or an option to start both Tor and Privoxy, or all three. Put
the option in the configuration.  Then when the button is pressed, poof,
everything starts. Maybe an option to end Tor, Privoxy, TorCP when the
button is deactivated.  Talk about ultimate convenience.
As for the button being text only, it's perfect.  Simple and effective.
K.I.S.S(Keep It Simple Stupid) :) Reply-To: papercrane at reversefold.com
Quick question....how the heck do I use it? All I see is enable and disable.
Does it automatically run its own tor client? How do I set up the client to
connect to?

This really is not feasible.  The mechanism for running Tor is different for
every platform and varies considerably between users.  This is also
something that from a security standpoint should not be possible to do with
javascript.  I have addressed this feature request before:

It's a wrapper for IE, not an actual browser. You can go to
"options" then "proxy" then "proxy setup". If you are running the default
Tor/Privoxy configuration then hit the green "+" button at the top right,
Name it "TOR(Privoxy)", address is "localhost:8118" and speed is "faster".
If you want to use TOR alone without Privoxy(not recommended, less secure),
Name it "TOR(No Privoxy)", address is "localhost:9050", speed is "faster".
To use it, go to "options", "proxy", then select the proxy you want to use.
