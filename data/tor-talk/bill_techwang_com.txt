My take (on his take :) ) was that;
a) trusting a VPN for security is a bad idea because no VPN operator is going to go to jail for you (see HideMyAss and Sabu etc)
b) he assumes most VPN accounts can be tied back to you; almost no-one is going to bitcoin+tor every interaction with their VPN provider
c) given a+b, relying on a VPN as your exit is a bad idea for anyone with a FBI/CIA level opponent
This is a big generalization though; you could anonymise every interaction with the VPN, use a Russian VPN, chain VPNs together etc.

I think leeroy presented some compelling reasons why in his case 1 (easier to do correlation attacks on VPN over Tor etc)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking STUN Requests at Firewall? 
Hi all,
I've setup a Tor transparent proxy, as per the instructions here  (I'm aware of the security risks of not using the Tor Browser)
It's working well except it is vulnerable to STUN requests (as per  Does anyone have experience of blocking these requests? Based on the spec they can be TCP or UDP, so just blocking non DNS UDP doesn't seem to help. Maybe it could be achieved using DPI? Not much info on the net.

In case anyone is interested I managed to block STUN requests using an application level firewall on the router. Probably not 100%, but definitely an improvement...

This image explains VPN + tor quite well;
IMO this setup is a pretty sensible idea given the recent de-anonymisation attacks (e.g. CMU). If your Tor connection gets comprimised, all the Feds have (hopefully) is your VPN IP.
The best way to set this up is VPN at a router level (e.g.  then run Tails or Tor browser on your laptop.
