@_subject: [tor-talk] William was raided for running a Tor exit node. 
actually it is not a "similar case" but the case of William W. that
BBC reported. Though with some mistakes: the servers were not seized,
the hardware (drives etc) at his home was seized, William was not
charged (he says), police is just investigating.
And so far only the police know if "images showing child sex abuse"
were actually "found passing through them" as BBC writes.
The warrent posted at arstechnica.net
mentions section 207a, para 2, 2nd case, and para 4 no 2, lit b of
Austrian Criminal Code, which would be possession of a a pornographic
depiction of a minor person over 14, showing their genitals in an
obscene manner. (the text of the relevant section in German:
The warrent does not mention anything that refers to distribution or
transport of pornographic images. So, either police and judge were not
aware that it was a TOR server or they have/had a suspicion
that's not related to running a TOR server. Or the made a
mistake and quoted the wrong section. We simply don't know at present.
