Please make 64 default, 32 is historical by now. I'm talking about this page Currently is says "For Linux users (change 32 to 64 if you have the 64-bit package):
gpg --verify tor-browser-linux32-6.5.1_en-US.tar.xz.asc
     tor-browser-linux32-6.5.1_en-US.tar.xz"
It's just a little wrinkle but still needs fixing. So swap 32 and 64 (in text and URLs.).
