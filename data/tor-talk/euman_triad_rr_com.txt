if 'tor' is made to be respectable it shouldn't be blacklisted.
Anyone with ethereal can re-assemble packets so there goes the digital
There should be in place certain rules (what rules Im unsure of)
for instance on my box I allow 9001 for the Tor Server and 9030 for
the Directory service and Ive noted that any ip using ports
that aren't routed through the 'tor' application are auto-blacklisted
by me. I might be an open-proxy but I keep an eye on things so,
there should be a mechanism put in place for everyone that does
exactly what Ive described.
e,g: inbound tor or-port - destination 70.71.72.73 app tor [allowed]
     inbound tor or-port - destination 70.71.72.73 app null [denied]
doesn't matter what port the destination goes to as long as it's routed
through the 'tor' application.
How to implement this is beyond me atm with the exception of keeping a steady eye on your firewall.
Please inform me that I don't know what the hek I'm talking about and that I should just shutup...
