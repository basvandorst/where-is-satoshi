@_subject: [tor-talk] Shewstring v1.0.2 release 
Hi everyone,
Shewstring v1.0.2 is now being released!
Here are the major changes:
    * I2P has been fixed, and support has been dramatically improved
(with more than an order of magnitude increase in efficiency; wrapper
and jbigi work), thanks mostly to the I2P devs.
    * Fix a major bug where wireless did not work due to a problem with
    * Misc. XFCE improvements.
    * Pidgin is now allowed to keep 'pounces.xml' across reboots.
    * Added new Shew GPG key.
    * Misc. bugfixes, tweaks and updates.
Regarding the regressions in the previous version:
    * I2P has been fixed and improved to work better than before the
regression (see above).
    * The window lag bug is not reproducible on other test machines.
This suggests to me that it is a FreeBSD driver regression, and not
something that I can fix. Let me know if you experience it too.
You can find more general information, and the actual release, here:
A little OT, for people who follow my blog: I have made a small post
about the new F/LOSS movement taking place on one of the Onionland
forums. Also my key has changed. More info reachable through the main

@_subject: Shewstring v1.0.0 release! 
Hi everyone,
I have been working on this toolkit for quite a while, and I think it
is now stable enough for some general use. Enjoy!
Shewstring is a collection of Bourne Shell functions and scripts for
building installers of secure and anonymous FreeBSD distros. It is
primarily intended for developers of anonymity systems, administrators
of anonymous services (such as Tor hidden services), security experts,
etc., but ordinary users that have some skill in the art of security
and anonymity may find it very useful too. One use of it might be to
build an installer for easy to set up inproxies and outproxies for the
darknets; another might be to host a service across all major darknets;
or the user of the software might just want a secure desktop with
cryptography tools and access to all major darknets. Shewstring
abstracts away most of the complexities of building secure systems, so
an installer can consist of simple function calls and script
executions. Only customization or use of darknet features that don't
have functions yet would need custom shellcode.
Shewstring currently comes with one pre-built installer, the Shewstring
Shewstring Desktop is an installation which provides a very secure
desktop system with tools for encrypted and anonymized communications.
It balances between the storing of no information (thus leaving few
local traces of your activities) and storing information (enabling you
to have better continuous communications). It does this by segregating
all programs into different jails, and giving them each their own user,
and then separating the programs' files into write-only files,
temporary write files (changes are lost after shutting down), and a
very few read-write files. In addition, programs are chosen carefully
with security in mind and are further locked down in their
configuration. Anonymity is preserved by forcing the programs with a
firewall to only use the communications channels that are allowed for
their jail (one jail may allow only non-anonymized communications, and
another may allow ONLY anonymized communications).

Hi everyone,

Only customization or use of darknet features that dont have functions yet would need custom shellcode.
Here are the major changes:
    * Vidalia now works, thanks to the Tor community.
    * Fixed Tor hidden services.
    * Add anti-tracking entries in Adblock Plus.
    * Fixed a bug where calling some scripts with a relative path instead of an absolute one caused them to malfunction.
    * Added two scripts for users: scripts/backup.sh and scripts/restore.sh to create and restore encrypted 7z backups of your Shewstring files.
    * You can now install Shewstring using only one removable medium, instead of two.
    * Add ExcludeExitNodes entries generated by InspecTor.
    * Protect users of scripts/upload_ftp.sh from file modification time leaks.
    * audit.sh now securely wipes the trash folder in /usr/shew/data, if it exists.
    * Fixed XFBurn.
    * Many programs updated, and configurations tweaked.
    * Many small bugs fixed.
There are, unfortunately, some regressions. I will be working on these and I will try to release a fix soon:
    * Some window status changes are laggy.
    * I2P has stopped working.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Shewstring v1.0.3 release 
Hi everyone,
I have just released Shewstring v1.0.3:
Here are the major changes:
* Increased partition sizes, because they were pretty close to the
* GnuPG/GPA has been moved to its own user. Before it used the same
user as Sylpheed, but now the permissions problem has been fixed.
* Firefox should now recognize MIMEtypes that are openable by Abiword,
Evince, and VLC.
* Added a new user script scripts/maintenance.sh, which will maintain
and update the installation. It is only partially completed, however
(does not yet update ports, ExcludeExitNodes, or I2P). This fixed a
nasty problem where Freenet would eventually stop working, due to their
policy of blocking nodes with old versions from accessing the network.
* Use portsnap instead of ports tarballs. Advantages: nobody has to
deal with ports tarballs anymore; more secure method of getting ports
skeleton than tarballs. Disadvantages: devs can no longer ensure that
users are getting a specific tested version of software, which can lead
to problems with broken ports and software behavior changes.
* Misc. bugfixes, tweaks and updates.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy suggestion: block subject header when 
Hello everyone,
One of the problems with Thunderbird with Enigmail (and PGP mail in
general) is that when sending encrypted email the subject header
remains unencrypted. On its own this is just annoying, since you can
just leave it blank. However, Enigmail does not block or even warn the
user if they are sending an encrypted email with something in the
subject header. I assume that TorBirdy would be used in conjunction
with Enigmail for email over Tor, so I recommend that, if possible,
TorBirdy should block the use of the subject header when sending
encrypted email.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy suggestion: block subject header when 
I agree that Enigmail is the correct place to enact this, but a search
on the subject brings up this forum post:
in which the Enigmail developers do not seem very responsive to the
concerns of sensitive information in the subject header. The stated
opinion of several of the developers is that they wish to wait until a
specification for encrypted headers is published by a standards body
before they will do anything. Granted this is in the context of asking
for it to be encrypted instead of blocking it or warning the user, but
something along those lines was suggested and ignored. The final
suggestion was "There is a simple solution for this problem: don't
write anything sensitive in the Subject." rather than an
acknowledgement that this is a possible source of significant user
Of course the forum thread is in the context of some random users
bringing it up, but if it was in the context of something like TorBirdy
and possibly the Tor Browser Bundle things may be different: "We are
considering bundling your software in a major software package but we
have a couple of concerns. Could you work with us on them?"
P.S. Another thread here:
