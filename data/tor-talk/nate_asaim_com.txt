@_subject: ExitPolicy: ports 1024-65535 needed? 
Alright, I've got some questions. I've been reading, and I may not have all this down right, but I'll dive in.
 From my understanding, conencting tor clients get to pick their routes through the network. Suppose they were to pick an exit node whose exit policy doesn't support the port they want to connect to. Do they hear about it? How easy would it be for them to pick another exit node? A nice feature would be for users to be able to choose their level of exposure (web only, BT and smtp if they feel ok handling complaints, etc). What implications would this have on the anonymity and security of the network if this were the case?
I would imagine that even users with completely blocked exit policies (middleman nodes?) would be helpful contributors.

If you really wanted to throw off the trail, why wouldn't you actually use the network to conceal your efforts instead? The abuse potential is the same, whether it's actual or whether it stems from deniability. Not that this makes your concerns invalid.
This sounds oddly like saying tor really isn't as useful as you might think. At least, for concealing bad behaviour, anyway.

I tend to think that freedom of speech is best implemented not as a right of the speaker, but of the audience. Freedom of speech is the right to be heard by those who wish to hear, not necessarily the right to speak in exclusion.
By using this listener-rights model, it tends to clear up grey areas like fraud, since being lied to is, utlimately, a violation of the listener's consent to listen - no one wants to be lied to.
This is why I think TOR is important - it's among a vangaurd of projects that is capable of protecting publishers (ie, Internet servers) as well as audiences (clients/browsers). If you protect listeners, but not speakers, it doesn't do much good, because no one can safely say certain Because publishers and audiences of all classes and capabilities are enforced by the technical nature of the system into having equal status, there's less opportunity for consolidation of resources. Equality is enforced by the system's architecture rather than by the (too often lacking) good faith of the participating parties.

@_subject: exit node only server 
This is where I get to thinking that a balancing act between client use and exit use should have been designed in, much like the tit-for-tat algorithm built into bittorrent. Sure, anybody can build their own app to cheat the protocol, but the majority will just install what's easiest to find, provided it works for them.
Having users provide exit nodes by default would certainly have improved availability of the lean resources we seem to be suffering from now.

When establishing trust relationships, one always has to give away a little bit to get started. In order for a potential ally to establish a reputation of good stewardship with me, I have to give him a small amount of expendable resources, in order to determine whether that generosity will be returned. As the reputation inherent in such a relationship grows, the amount of resources can also grow.
This is the technique Bittorrent uses. greedy bt users don't get shut out - they just get very slow service. The fewer resources you need, the closer you get to not needing to provide any resources at all in order to get what you want. It's a function of the reosurce pool and the number of participants. If all you need is a little bit, then you should be able to get it without too much trouble, and without disrupting the bigger operations of the network.

@_subject: disappearing nodes 
All of the above. Yes, it's crashed while I wasn't looking. I also suspect (but can't prove) that a recent DOS attack that forced the entire server offline was in retaliation for something that went through the TOR exit node. I can't really afford that kind of downtime. I also get paged regularly by the server because TOR is using too much CPU. I'm looking toward getting a dedicated server to handle these kinds of projects. For now, they're too much of a liability, and I don't have the time or money to get it situated safely.
