The OP is presumably saying that the domain refered to in the

That's because it's been suspended by the registrar: tor-resolve returns

It's a Firefox Addon and it modifies/filters/inserts HTTP headers into
 the requests Firefox makes. Alterations can be enabled and disabled
 with a click, so you can disable them when not needed.
Headers sent by the browser control which pages are cached. See
Section 14.9 Cache-Control
and Neither could I. It may be entirely in memory. Nevertheless that was the
conclusion I came to. It's not the IP address being cached, it's the
response from the site I would say. Your new request is never being sent
(via your new IP) because Polipo is returning the cached version of the
page IMO.
Anyone have other ideas?

check or some other 'openssl' object

@_subject: [tor-talk] Socks port question 
Hi all,
 I've been experimenting with Tor's SOCKS port using a little PHP script
 to connect to an IP and send an HTTP request and print out the
 response, closing the connection. I've notice that if I send one
 request immediately after another (so I'm terminating the script before
 rerunning it (hence with a new process ID), and closing it between the
 two connection attempts), the two responses take different amounts of
 time - usually the second is slower.
 Is this an issue with stream isolation, and can I avoid it (when I'm
 connecting to the same destination both times)? I'm using the same
 UserID in the SOCKS4 logon every time. I've tried sending a
 'Connection: Keep-alive' header but that just stops End of File ever
 being detected when reading back the response.

So this is nothing to do with Tor.
That's not particularly unusual - the website you are visiting is seeing
accesses from different countries, and so may be serving slightly
different content to suit those countries.
It may also server slightly different content at different times.
 If you mean that there is no Whois entry for
 s3-us-west-2-w.amazonaws.com , for example, that is normal: Whois only
 provides data for second-level domains (in this case amazonaws.com),
 not subdomains of those. Also of course some Top-Level-Domains (.eu,.au
 for example) provided only limited information - which they are
 entitled to do.  I don't understand this, sorry. Can you give an example?

The trace doesn't take place through the Tor network: the malware placed
on the target person's computer can call home over the clearnet (this is
where Tails/Whonix/VMs come in as a second line of defense); or the

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN Clarification 
Yes, as long as the Tor *client* (Torbrowser) is running locally, the
connection *to* the Tor network is encrypted with Tor's encryption and
from that point of view it makes no difference if that connection is
direct or via a VPN ( VPN > Tor).
 If you run Tor > VPN, the connection *out of* the tor network is only
 encrypted with the VPN encryption and so vulnerable to sniffing by the
 VPN provider or a theoretical cracker of their encryption: if the
 traffic or the provider can identify you, you've lost anonymity with
 respect to the final destination.
 The worst case is if the Tor *client* is run remotely and you connected
 a normal browser to it via a VPN. Then you are entirely at the mercy of
 the VPN provider and their encryption from the point of view of
 deniability should you be investigated for some reason.

Hello all,
my current experience of Tor is very frustrating in that it generally
won't work for any length of time without changing identity, sending a
SIGHUP or completely restarting. Since I've tried various versions
(built from source), I assume the problem is with some other OS
component or dependency. The following unedited log extract typifies the
problem: identical curl requests to the Socks port which timed out
'Failed to receive SOCKS5 connect request ack' when the URL is fine over
clearnet. Using Vidalia to look at circuits, I often see many in the
'Building' state permanently, or even just 'Path empty', but completed
circuits will often not work either.
Using 'new identity' usually produces a complete working circuit after a
few attempts.
More logs available if anyone wants them - but since this probably isn't
a Tor bug, I won't open a Trac ticket.

Thanks both for responding. It's OSX10.4, the clock is synchronized via
NTP, openssl is the latest port, and the problem affects any application
using Tor - curl, polipo, tsocks and even tor-resolve time-out in a
similar way.I have seen messages to the effect of 'client request when we no longer
have a valid consensus' and also 'very long circuit build time -
assuming clock jump'. I think it more likely that Tor is freezing ( I
see no increase in cpu time at all with 'ps') sometimes and therefore
the clock appears to jump when it unfreezes. Is that a possibility?
