@_subject: Any GSoC news? 
I submitted my Google Summer of Code application and sent a couple of mails to tor-assistants at freehaven.net, as specified in the wiki page, but I never heard anything about it since: no comments or feedback.
Just wondering how are things going... :)

@_subject: Free Software and Torpark 
It just makes no sense to say "it's free except for..." if you intend free as in freedom. It's the same kind of idea of those who think that "Tor should be working for everyone except for criminals...".
About the "malware" problem, i just report this quote from the OS Definition page on wikipedia:
"Back in the 1980s, some software which was given away had license terms that specifically prohibited the police or military of the Government of South Africa from using the program because of objections to apartheid. While this is a laudable goal, it's not relevant to include it in a software license. Beyond which, such organizations might simply ignore the restrictions anyway."
What if the license was to block criminals from using the program? Would you still consider it free? What if the license was to block people that commited a crime in the past? What if the license was to block people that are more likely to commit a crime for their personal psychological Would you still consider it "free"?

I'm not sure if you're actually coding the program or not. If you do, then you should probably have a look at the ProxySelector class:
You can change the default proxy with setDefault() and handle problems with the proxy using connectFailed().
Hope this helps,

Actually, I've always been quite amazed by the fact that TorButton's
.xpi (binary?) files are not signed.
I'd really like to see this implemented in the future.

Sorry, but I have to point out that none of the proposed solution really
works, and both are actually quite bad from the security point of view.
"Fetch it over SSL" doesn't give the user any guarantee about the
authenticity of the file. Actually it does little about security. It
only verifies that the user is connected to the real Tor website, but if
the file is corrupt or, worse, has been maliciously replaced by some
malware version of it, you have no means of finding out. Since we are
talking in this very thread about Tor servers being attacked, I consider
this as a serious threat.
"Check the git/gpg sig" is a little better, but from a quick look at the
git repository I couldn't find the .xpi's on it (correct me if I'm wrong
here). This means that only the sources are signed, thus requiring the
user to recompile the package at every new release. This is time
consuming, but it also add some additional requirements on the user,
like having the right compilation environment on the box, having it
properly configured etc. All this for no security benefit. Finally,
checking the git's signature is not as easy as checking a simple .asc file.
So, I have to join Jim's plea. Mike, could you please put the .xpi's
.asc signature files on the TorButton website?
P.S. Are git connection to the Tor git's repository protected by TLS
against a valid certificate?

Wow, that sounds quite scary. Ok, probably it's no big deal for any
addon that is not security-centric, but it's still not nice to
arbitrarily modify someone else's code.
Thanks! I love the Tor community for always keeping up with expectations.

@_subject: [tor-talk] massive automated bridge requests: why? 
In Italy, a law (well, not exactly, a decree by the telecommunication
authority, AGCOM) about an IP blacklist for file sharing websites is
being discussed. A final decision was supposed to be made in July, but
was finally delayed, probably till next November. Some links in English
that discuss it:
Because of this, many links and short guides to Tor are being posted
around, mostly by inexperienced users that do not warn about the
potential security problems, and are in generally quite misleading as to
what Tor actually is and how it works. In this context, the idea that an
unofficial, and apparently badly built Tor bundle might be out there
only makes sense.

You clearly do not understand the general procedure stated in European
crime laws. In most EU countries, the police cannot arrest you, after
being charged, unless they can prove that:
- you are likely to escape;
- you are likely to commit the crime again;
- you are likely and able to destroy or conceal evidence or somehow
manipulate witnesses.
Let me say this again: *after* you have been charged. This comes from
the principle that you are considered innocent until proven guilty, that
is, until the last court appeal was unsuccessful. This usually means 3
trials, and years later than the criminal proceeding start.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Italy - third highest number users 
A major local filesharing website (hundreds of thousands active users)
was blocked at the DNS level in the country around that time. Among the
solutions to circumvent the block proposed by the admins of the site
through their twitter account was the usage of Tor.
It is also interesting to note that, after this, a sizable portion of
Italian Internet users now uses a DNS other than the one supplied by
their ISP, and usually a foreign one. This reduces the impact any
further censorship imposed at the DNS level might have.

MD5 is not collision resistant, and as such it shouldn't be used for verifying file integrity against tampering. A tampered file might be computed in order to have the same MD5 checksum of the original with a relatively small effort. See for instance
Attacks are particularly effective against .tar.gz, as they allow for arbitrary binary content to be added.
Use cryptographic signatures or, at the very least, a modern hash function like SHA-2/3.
