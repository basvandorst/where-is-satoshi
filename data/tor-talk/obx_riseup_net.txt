socat is overkill to do this. checkout connect-proxy.
Here's the ProxyCommand line from my ~/.ssh/config

I know this is the reason, but there are still captchas, right?
Also, I think this list needs to be expanded.
I'm not sure if gmail is safe against this recent adversary, regardless
of the protocol.

No, this is not necessary.
Not sure why they do this, but I assume it's to provide Tor to
applications that are unable to use socks5.

Do you intend to extend to other darknets networks, too?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Don't use sectoor 
Dear tor-talk, Dear sectoor,
I'm running a tor-exit at a small provider. Another customer at the same
provider complained they got blacklisted by sectoor for operating a
tor-exit. This customer doesn't run a tor server and didn't run a tor
server in the past.
Hence, they got blacklisted as tor-exit.
I did some lookups and it looks like you banned the whole class C.
There's no need to "guess" since the list of tor exits is public
Please understand that is level of irresponsible management on your
site, sectoor, can destroy the reputation of smaller providers.
I expect you fix this instantly.

Sectoor is no ISP. They run a DNSBL. Sorry if my message has been
The problem is, that the /24 of the ISP hosting my tor-exit has been
banned as tor-exit, regardless that I'm the only tor-exit on that
network. This is disrupting IRC and mail traffic. I assume this might
have happened to quite a few /24's out there.
*If* sectoor would be an ISP I wouldn't complain. But disrupting the
service of innocent neighbors that just happen to have a similar IP
address is irresponsible.

I apologize for my first mail, I should have waited to calm down a bit.
I've been looking into your website and figured out how to configure my
relay to not get listed.
I was allowing tcp/8000 since it's a common alternative http port. I'm
curious why you're listing tor exits that allow to exit to this port?
I'm currently waiting for the tor network to propagate my new exit
policy that shouldn't conflict with your listing.
Did you know there's an official TorDNSEL?
I hope you may understand my initial response since I was present in the
 channel while some customers where not satisfied about this.
This was unprofessional and I'm very sorry.
Sincerly yours,
Jane Smith

Thanks for your nice reply.
I've removed the offending port and it got accepted in the consensus
about 12h ago. Can you provide some information how long it takes until
the network isn't listed anymore?
Thanks in advance.
