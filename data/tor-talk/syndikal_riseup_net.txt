hey, sorry to bother you Thomas.
your signed message doesn't seem to be valid: i requested and refreshed
both of the keys quoted from keyservers and imported them directly from
your website ( it still doesn't
correctly verify in my email client or via GnuPG cli interface.
are you using a new key, or have you been compromised? your prominence
in this community makes me wary.

i'd be very interested in purchasing these if you were to share the
offers! finding hosts happy to allow exit nodes is tricky but it seems
like you've got it down.
