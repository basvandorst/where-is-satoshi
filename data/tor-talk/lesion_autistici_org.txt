@_subject: [tor-talk] torjail - run programs in tor network namespace 
You cannot run tor inside torjail.
Well, you can, but the tor instance inside torjail would exit through
the tor instance outside torjail (so using 6 nodes and not only 3 hops).
the whole point of torjail is to force all traffic via a virtual network
interface that's routed into tor's sock5 (tor is started by torjail
an use case could be an hidden service:
let's say you're running a website as an hidden service and your website got
hacked. without torjail an attacker could found the real ip of your
website easily.
thunderbird is another use case: if you got hacked, it's easier to
deanonimize you without torjail.
I hope this clarifies.
ps. if you think the project's name is a real issue, suggestions are welcome :)
