@_subject: [tor-talk] Connecting Vidalia with Private TOR Server 
Hi Everyone,
I want to connect my Vidalia software to my own configured Private TOR Directory Server, so how is it possible? Do I have to use TOR Bridge or is there any other recommended tool for connecting to the own private tor server.
Any help will be highly appreciated!!!
Many Thanks & Warmest Regards,
Faisal Rehman

Hi Everyone,
Which is the best tool with the help of which I can connect to my own private TOR network. Remember I have used Vidalia for it but I was un-successful as Vidalia is not connecting to the private tor network but it is connected to the Public TOR network.
So how it can be achieved, it is my last step please!!

Hi Andrew,
Yeah I had followed these steps and the tor process is also running for my private tor network, but I am very confused that how can I connect to it? So I tried vidalia for that purpose because I was thinking that may be it will be connected to my own private tor directory server.
So can you suggest me the best TOR client please so that I can connect to the server easily.

Hi Andrew,
Let me explain you in a bit detail, I have followed that link? I have successfully set up following all the steps given in that link & it is running as you can see from the below output:

Now it is running as my own Directory Authority & I have not configured any tor relay for this directory authority & also tor client. Yeah you also got my problem which is how can I configure a tor client that can talk to my own private directory authority, because simply firing up vidalia connects with the Public TOR network which isn't my requirement.
So I hope you got my point, any help would be highly appreciated!!!

I think there is a disconnect somewhere in our understanding of what
you're doing. When you say 'private tor network', I take that to mean:
- you are running your own directory authorities
- you are runnning your own tor relays which are configured for your
? directory authorities
- you have configured a client tor to use the directory authorities
None of the above involves Vidalia. Vidalia is a controller for tor
with a subset of functionality available in the torrc configuration
Once you have a tor client configured to talk to your private directory
authorities, then you just simple fire up vidalia and connect to that
tor client. What you see in the Network Map will simply reflect the size
of your private tor network. The tor client is doing the work, vidalia
is just a pretty display of everything.

Hi Andrew,
Okay I will run some more directory authorities but how these will be tied with each other via relays, sorry for asking very basic questions but I am unable to find help for it over the internet. So I hope with your help I will setup my own private tor network soon and launch it. Please also tell me about tor client.
Many Thanks & Warmest Regards,

You need to run tor relays that tie into your directory authority. And then you need to configure the tor client to point at your directory authority.
Running one directory authority does not create a 'private tor network'.

Hi Andrew,
I have found the solution for the tor client as well which I hope will be done using the same server and with the below link I think:
I hope this will solve my problem of tor clients & now one thing is left which is tor relays configuration :), I was supposing that it will be easy for me to use Vidalia for relay configuration as per your comments to no involvement of vidalia, now I am a little confused how can I configure multiple relays on the same server?
Many Thanks & Warmest Regards,

Maybe someone else can help out here, but everything you need to know is at  There are a number of lines where it starts off with "for each", this means you need to do these steps multiple times, once for each directory authority, once for each relay, and once for each tor client.? For a while there were people working on a script to automate these steps, I don't know what happened to the script nor their progress.

Hi Smith,
I think you too want to setup your own private TOR network but first of all you have to follow this link as your initial task:
Then we will be moving on because I am also not fully successful in its configuration and testing yet :)

I'm a researcher who just went through that wiki section to set up my
own (small) private Tor network, and would be very interested in that
script. If the people Andrew is talking about are on this mailing list,
could you please chime in and let us all know how you're doing? I'm sure
I'm not alone in wanting to see something like this exist.

These days I use chutney
( for templating a
bunch of Tor instances and launching them locally.? It's more suited
for testing Tor changes than for running a production network on a
bunch of machines, but you could probably adapt it to do what you need
if you know a little python and are willing to get your hands dirty.
It is still in an underdocumented and basically unsupported state: "if
it breaks, you can keep both pieces" as they say.
See also Sebastian's privnet scripts at

better if you prefer sh. Same disclaimers apply.

Hi Andrew,
Good Day!! I have established several Directory Authorities on my Linux server but now I want to move further I mean their connection or integration with each other so that ?a Small Private Network can be established so that it can be tested, I will surely donate to TOR once I'll be having that private tor network established and tested :)
Have a Nice Weekend!!!?
