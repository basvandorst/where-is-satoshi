@_subject: "cracks" via tor 
I just got a complaint from someone who said one of my servers (running a tor daemon) had a "hacker" on it trying to break into his website. He sent me some log entries, which had some pretty tame "foo.pl?user=bill" type of hits.
While this doesn't look like the crack of the century, it does pose an interesting question in that if someone is trying to do web exploits via tor, how can such a thing be prevented? I can't think of any way.
Could this have some dodgy legal implications for people running tor servers? I'm sure EFF has something to say about this. ;)
P.S. Fedora Core 3 tor RPMs @

@_subject: fingerprinting 
As many of you have probably seen, some CAIDA folks have come up with a method for fingerprinting machines on the 'net by calculating the box's clock skew.
Since the express purpose of tor is to allow people to use the Internet anonymously, this could be a direct "attack" on tor.
Thinking about it a bit, it appears to me that tor is not vuln to this as the "fingerprintee" would only be susceptible during it's first hop to the tor entry server. The middle & exit servers would then change the timestamp to their /own/ timestamp and then send that to the final web server.
Am I looking at this correctly? Does tor mitigate these fingerprint attacks?
That said, are their any other suggestions for preventing these types of fingerprinting?
 ok, i'm a bit embarassed to be linking to slashdot... ;)

@_subject: disappearing nodes 
I was pushing some huge bandwidth with tor, which was fine. But then another project needed /lots/ of bandwidth (like 25Mbit), so to stay under my monthly quota (which I think i'm going to blow past anyway), I turned off tor. When the other site's traffic goes down again, I'll re-enable it. :)
I have also gotten two complaints from people on the 'net about users that abused tor via my node. This wasn't why I shut it down (in neither case did the people request that I do either), but it has made me consider turning off being an exit node.
And...tor has crashed a couple times without me noticing for a day or two. I haven't written any script to automagickally restart it.
