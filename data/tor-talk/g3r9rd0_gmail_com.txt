@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB browser without Tor/Vidalia 
I'm trying to run the TBB browser separately* *from Vidalia, I want to star
using Vidalia as a relay. So far I've been using the TBB with no problems,
but for security reasons I use it from a encrypted area (mostly because of
the browser), and the relay consumes a lot of resources if I run it from
this area (the encrypted one).
I'm on windows xp, any help will be appreciated
ps: I already tried to run the tbb-firefox.exe directly - it just created a
new profile at %appdata%. Also tried to call it with "-no-remote -profile
[path to profile in TBB]", and, the browser did open, but it couldn't
connect to Tor (v. relay uses port 9050 instead of 9051, the one used in
TBB, I tried to change it in the browser with no success...)

Thanks Moritz,
I tried to run it but an error pops up:
"No se encuentra el punto de entrada del procedimiento _vsnprintf_s en la biblioteca de v?culos din?micos msvcrt.dll"
Sorry, my os is in spanish, but it obviously refers to the dll, which is installed in my pc - also tried to put this dll in different folders in the TorBrowser which resulted in the same error.
Is it OS related? Perhaps it doesn't run in windows xp (my os)?

You should try the 3.0 alpha releases, where Vidalia is completely gone
from TBB. I don't see how it could solve your problem, but it might.
Tor as a client should not consume that many resources, especially since
you're talking about disk encryption, and Tor does not touch your disk
much. I wonder what the underlying issue is here.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy question 
I recently stop using TBB in order to use a Vidalia relay, the problem is that TorBirdy uses the 9150 port to connect to Tor (the port that uses with TBB), and the relay uses the 9050. I tried to change in the config editor the value "extensions.torbirdy.restore.network.proxy.socks_port;9150" to 9050, but id didn't connect to Tor.... in the end, I changed the TorBirdy preferences, from "recommendede proxy settings" to "custom...", using the 9050 port.
Is there any way to change for real the port to TorBirdy in the config Thanks in advance,

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB browser without Tor/Vidalia 
I didn't understand... I'm looking for a way to run the browser that comes with the TBB without Vidalia and Tor, this two to I'll run them via a Vidalia relay; how can I do this?

Thank you all,
Actually, from the 3rd link, there is a very good recommendation:
Leave Vidalia Running while closing Firefox (Tor Browser)
...... Alternatively, you could also use a second Tor instance and let it listen on another port
TBB uses as ControlPort 9151 and SocksPort 9150, and, respectively, Vidalia Relay 9050 & 9051, so, it's possible to run both (since I only use TBB for little while, and V. Relay a lot more with Thunderbird+TorBirdy)
Thanks again!!!

Thank you both,
I'll wait for the update, hopefully I'll come with the option to configure the Tor port,
Keep up the good work!!!

Thank you,
I was referring to add the capability for the user to change the SocksPort in the "recommended proxy settings" (at least at the config editor), not in the "Use custom proxy setting", where is too clear it can be changed.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How much data does TBB write to disk? 
Hi every one,
I use a shared computer, so, to use TBB, y installed it in a encrypted area of the disk; the problem is, is quite an old pc, so is kind of heavy to run it from here. I'm evaluating to run it from a no-encrypted area, I just wonder if TBB (with no modifications from the user) writes *any* thing to the hd.
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: [tor-talk] best distro to use Tor 
I've been using Tor in Windows for a while now, mostly for practical reasons I couldn't change the OS, but I'm thinking now it's time to change to Linux, and I'm a little lost in what particular distro I should use:
  * Heard a lot about Talis, but I can't use a live cd for my day to day
    work
  * I think Whoinx in a VM could do the work
  * Is Ubuntu a good option as a guest (and maybe use here the TBB from
    time to time)? So far is the only Linux distro that I've used
Thanks in advance,

Thank you both for your answers, I'm at best a secure/user/wannabe ;-) but I also have the impression that there is no secure OS at all, as Adrelanos said, there is just so many aspects that remain unknown (from within the computer and trough the net) that I think the best option is that, to look for the best option.
Thanks again!!!

Thank you all for your answers,
Since I'm no to experienced, may be my best option is to stay close to where Tor is developed, so, I think I'll go for Debian, which also looks solid in terms of community, ethics, etc.
