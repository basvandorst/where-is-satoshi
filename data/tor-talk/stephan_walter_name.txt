@_subject: Running Tor on a v-server with limited number of TCP sockets 
I have rented a small v-server where I can spare about 400GB of
bandwidth per month for Tor. Unfortunately, the number of open TCP
sockets is limited to 128 and the operator is not willing to change
that. (Any good reason why they wouldn't?). So what I'm doing now is
running Tor as a non-exit server with "ulimit -c 130", limiting the
number of network sockets to about 100 (The other thirty are regular
files and UDP sockets).
Is this a bad thing to do? (Apart from getting lots of warning messages
in the log file?) Of course I don't want to cause any problems on the
Tor network.

It's not as bad as that, as the ssh daemon is listening all the time and
therefor already has its socket.
costs only ?5/month though... and is enough for everything else.
I didn't think that it would harm existing circuits, but I thought that
maybe it would cause a lot of connections to drop.

I've read this wiki article, but didn't find any final answer. It says:
"Unfortunately, since Tor currently requires you to be able to connect
to all the other Tor servers, we need you to be able to use at least
1024 file descriptors. This means we can't make use of Tor servers that
are crippled in this way."
Well my server seems to be working more or less (nickname
"dangerdiabolik"), I just wanted to know whether it's any use to keep it
