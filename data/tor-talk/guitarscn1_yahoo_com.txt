@_subject: Socksify on Mac OS X 
I installed the Mac OS X  Vidalia bundle from the Tor website and
installed the dante port. I edited /etc/socks.conf with:
resolveprotocol: fake
route {
        from: 0.0.0.0/0   to: .   via: 127.0.0.1 port = 9050
        protocol: tcp
        proxyprotocol: socks_v5
So I tried the command "socksify irssi" and connected to an IRC network,
but my real IP still shows. What am I doing wrong here?
