@_subject: Tor Diffie-Hellman question 
I just read through the design paper (Tor: The Second Generation Onion Router), and I have a quick question that I'm sure one of you can answer.
I might be missing something obvious here, but if the first half of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange sent with the Create/Relay Extend commands is encrypted using RSA and the public key of the onion router in which it is destined, why do Diffie-Hellman at all?  Why not just have our Alice generate the AES key by herself, and send it down the circuit encrypted with the destination OR's public key?
Thanks a lot!

@_subject: (Newbie:) Why use privoxy? 
The problem with not using Privoxy is that browsers will try to resolve the IP addresses of web sites you are visiting before requesting the page through Tor.  This means a request is being sent, unprotected, from your computer to whatever DNS server you use.  This request will have in plain text the address of the web site whose host name you are trying to resolve.  That defeats the purpose of Tor to a large extent.
When you use Privoxy, your browser won't try to resolve host names.  Those host names will just be sent unresolved through Tor over TCP, and the exit node will resolve the hostname.  DNS requests aren't made directly through Tor because Tor only handles TCP traffic and DNS is UDP, but since the exit node is initiating the connection just as you would if you were unprotected with the destination, it can do the DNS lookup itself.
I hope this helps.
