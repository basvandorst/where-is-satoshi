Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone,
We would like to announce a new release of Tor-ramdisk (version
20080606), an i686 uClibc-based micro Linux distro (about 3.1MB ISO)
whose only purpose is to host a tor server in an environment which
maximizes security and privacy.  Security is enhanced by employing a
monolithically compiled GRSEC/PAX patched kernel and hardened system
tools. Privacy is enhanced by turning off logging at all levels so
that even the Tor operator only has access to minimal information.
Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral memory, no information
survives a reboot, except for the Tor configuration file and the
private RSA key which may be exported/imported by FTP.
The aim of the project is to really make Tor server (ie. an onion
ROUTER) into a router, with no hard drives.  This may be of interest
to tor-operators who are worried about having their hard drives examine.
Tor-ramdisk is not for hidden services since it does not support the
other resources required, such as an http server and hard drive space
for a web page.
Two major changes in this release: 1) configuring network and
configuring/running/stopping tor is now menu driven.  2) torrc and
secret_id_key can be imported/exported via FTP.
To do: 1) reduce system tools even further to restrict the system to
just running tor, 2) consider adding RBAC rules to restrict tor's
running environment, 3) consdier adding iptables firewall, 4) create a
bootable usb pen drive image in addition to the ISO, 5) add some form
of time syncronization

Hi Scott,
First let me answer a related question which is why security is a high
priority for this project.  We've seen lots of talk on this list about
unscrupulous exit node operators.  I wanted a system for the
conscientious tor operator which would give a minimum amount of
information in order to preserve privacy while at the same time giving
enough that he/she could determine that everything is working ok.
Even an innocent utility like netstat, which can be used to make sure
that connections are being established by the tor server also reveal
what IP addresses are connecting --- my concern may be a bit
exaggerated, but I think you get the point.  But while on the one hand
minimizing information makes me feel good as a tor operator, it makes
me very nervous as a system administrator because I no longer have the
diagnotic tools that would tell me if something fishy is going on.
Its not a guarantee, but hardening the kernel/system tools lets me
sleep better.
Having said that, why GRSEC/PaX Linux over OpenBSD?  I run sereval
OpenBSD and hardened Gentoo servers with GRSEC/PaX Linux and I trust
both.  OpenBSD is impressively secure across the board, but I what I
like about GRSEC is RBAC which, when properly configured, strongly
restricts a daemon's capabilities.  For systems with a narrow goal, I
tend towards GRSEC.  (I haven't enabled RBAC yet in tor-ramdisk, but
that's next.)  I can also assure people that my student (Melissa) and
I keep our eyes on the upstream dependencies for any security issues
and will update tor-ramdisk accordingly.
I don't want to annoy the list, so I think if we want to continue
talking about the relative merits of the varoius hardening techniques
employed by both, stackgaps, ssp, w^x and the like, we should do so

The kernel right now is 1.6 MB.  A lot of its size is because we're
supporting all 100MB and 1GB ethernet cards in a monolithic kernel.
Anyhow, that's a good suggestion.  Size isn't the biggest issue, but
if it slims it down, why not.

@_subject: Time synchronization on tor servers and tor clients 
Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone,
I had an experience a few months ago in which I was running a tor
client in a virtual machine.  Because of the way I'd configured
vmware, the clock of the virtual machine drifted significantly.  After
a while it was off by days --- the machine had been up about a month.
Anyhow, I noticed that tor wasn't working correctly in that it wasn't
making connections to entry guards.  When I would restart the daemon,
I could tell that it was starting up connections, but after a while
these all died.
So, my question is, does tor depend explicitly or implicitly on time
synchronization?  Perhaps via the "published" line in the
cached-routers list?

@_subject: Tor grassroots advocacy 
Is there contact information? I too am a little late to the party and I haven't followed the thread closely.
Rochester has also been the center of unfair bandwidth caping by Time Warner Cable. U.S. Rep. Eric Massa (D-N.Y.) is considering legislation that would prohibit TWC from continuing this abuse. Massa is quoted as ?At the very moment when access to digital information is at the heart of economic recovery, they?re going to go for corporate greed.? [1]
There are more links to informative sites at [1].
I see in Massa's statement a place for Tor advocacy. Economic recovery would only be hindered if access to digital information is bought at the price of privacy. Without privacy, the internet becomes a playground for exploitive and greedy corporations, of which we've seen too many examples. Such a chilling effect would discourage the public from entering into this new economic arena and decrease economic growth.
I suggest drafting a letter to Massa asking that tor nodes be also protected under his draft legislation and cite recent abuses lodged at McCabe by TWC as yet another example of corporate greed run amok.

I hit this bug
    stack smashing attack in function command_process_cell()
when running the new tor-0.2.1.19 compiled for embedded x86 system,
static linking.  The toolchain is
    gcc --version => gcc (GCC) 3.4.6 (Gentoo Hardened 3.4.6-r2 p1.6,
ssp-3.4.6-1.0, pie-8.7.10)
    uclibc-0.9.28
    binutils-2.18
The stack smashing protector is triggered after tor is up and fully
running, ie after it has bootstrapped, checked that its ports are
reacheable, performed bandwidth-self test and started relaying.  The
easiest workaround is to disable ssp in the compiler which is undesireable.
I manually audited command_process_cell() and it looks fairly innocent. Any suggestions from the gurus before I start a full blown attack on
this bug.
This problem was not present in 0.2.0.35 and below.

@_subject: TOR is for anonymization; so how to add encryption as well? 
It is encrypted except at the exit unless you use https or imaps or
whatever protocol + s.
Let me illustrate.  Suppose you go to  via
privoxy+tor, then you establish a tunnel like this:
             --------Tor's encryption--------------
client         ------ clear http ------------->        Tor Relay ...
             --------Tor's encryption--------------
This continues until you get to the exit
--------Tor's encryption--------------
    ------ clear http ------------->         Tor Exit ------ clear http
--------Tor's encryption--------------
So sniffing is impossible except at the exit.   The admin at the tor
exit should never look at the traffic leaving his/her node.
If you repeat the above, but go to  (note the
http+s), then the above changes in that the clear http is replaced by
encrypted https.  Then even the tor exit node admin can't see your traffic.
Hope this helps and that my ascii art didn't get wrapped beyond readability.

@_subject: setting up a TOR relay 
Hash: SHA1
Ciao Maurizio,
I have (tried) to run a tor relay on a Linksys WRT54G board with about
4MB of ram.  It does not work well and runs out of ram quickly.  I
gave the details of how I did it on this list so you can search the
As  a reference for how much ram one needs, I do have experience
running tor in an "embedded" environment but on an i386 box.  Node
"simba" has been running for months and boots tor-ramdisk, a micro
linux distro which basically sets up a ramdisk root filesystem with
the bare essentials for a tor server.  I set aside 128MB for ramdisk
and that's more than enough for BandwidthRate 150KB with
BandwidthBurst 200KB --- in fact its overkill.  From memory I think I
only need 30 MB or so for ramdisk.  What I don't have a good feeling
for is how much paging memory is needed at those speed.  Node "simba"
has 4GB of ram and never comes close to using it all but I'm not in
front of the box right now and I can't say what its using right now.
There is no remote access.  (When I walk my dog to the lab later I'll
take a look and get back to you:)
I also run "bonob2", a relay node on an ordinary box --- its on our
lab's ftp server.  Its running at BandwidthRate 50KB with
BandwidthBurst 75KB.  As I write this, ps aux gives RSS of 448 MB and
its  DataDirectory holds about 21 MB.
I would really like to know how these two memory requirements scale
with BandwidthRate.   I'm teaching a course on embedded devices and as
part of our class project we're porting tor-ramdisk to a mips board,
probably the RB433AH.  This sounds like what you're trying to do.

@_subject: Running tor relay on a MIPS board (Re: setting up a TOR relay) 
Hash: SHA1
Since my last post, I fixed some annoying problems I was having
running tor embedded in a MIPS arch --- actually tor was fine, but
there were issues with linking busybox and configuring the kernel.
So, I've now pretty much ported my little environment (tor-ramdisk) to
MIPS and I'm running a relay only tor node "mufasa".  Its running in
QEMU but as soon as I get my board, I'll move it over.   Its status
can be seen here:
The biggest question we've had is how much RAM does tor need in these
embedded environments.  Eg. I believe Kyle Willams who built JanusPA
used 256MB.  The answer to this question will depend on how you are
using tor: client only (like JanusPA), relay only, exit.  I'm going to
try to address this question systematically for a relay-only node.
I'll plot RAM and cpu usage versus BandwidthRate on mufasa for a few
points.  I'll further break down the RAM between ramdisk versus paging
memory.  Since the emulated environment is probably not the place to
do this reliably, I'll have to wait until my board comes.  I'll also
proceed carefully. eg. leave a relay up for a week before tweaking the
bandwidth.  This will give me good statistics and also cause minimal
disruption to the tor network itself.
For what its worth, here's the current usage after running about 12
hrs: ramdisk 13.8 MB, paging 50.6 MB = total 64.4 MB
The mips branch of tor-ramdisk can be obtained here
    BTW, I noticed a lot of downloads after my first post while I was
still changing files on the archive so you may want to redownload to
get the latest.  I've frozen the binaries for mufasa as release 20090125.
Any wishlist or caveats before I do my little experiment?

Hello everyone,
For those not familiar, tor-ramdisk is an i686 uClibc-based micro
Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy.  Security is enhanced
by employing a hardened environment, and privacy is enhanced by
turning off logging at all levels so that even the Tor operator only
has access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in
ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP.
Release 20090105 is a minor update release. Since tor-ramdisk follows
stable Tor, we are following their upgrade to tor-0.2.0.32 to
accomodate the bugfixes and new features. We also took this
opportunity to upgrade the kernel to Gentoo's 2.6.25-hardened-r11 to
keep up with their changes, although none that we know of effect
tor-ramdisk. Finally we also made a minor fix to the setup script
which is the main menu run on tty1. Since ntpd is started from init on
tty3 before networking is configured and brought up, it doesn't reach
any servers and just sits there. When networking is up, ntpd stays
stuck and needs to be restarted. Previously one would do so manually
by switching to tty3 with Alt-F3 and hitting ctrl-C. With 20090105,
ntpd is automatically restarted whenever the networking is
reconfigured to make sure it updates to its new environment. We still
recommend checking by switching to tty3 and seeing ntpd's log output
and making sure that time is well synchronized.
As with all releases, this one is tested in a virtual environment and
in the wild. Node "simba" has been running 20090105 for about a week
as a relay only node with no problems.
As a side note: there has been lost of discussion of putting tor on
ARM and MIPS processors lately and so work is now underway to port
tor-ramdisk to more router specific boards.

@_subject: Best practice for DNS through tor 
Hi everyone,
I'd like to set up an situation where users on a LAN can optionally reroute just their DNS queries through tor.  What I have is a gateway router where bind9 runs on udp 53 (caching only) and tor uses DNSPort 5300.  I'd like the users to be able to "do something" on their local computers which switches DNS queries to the router on port 5300 rather than 53.  Any suggestions on a best practices?  Here's what I've tried:
1) I wrote a perl script to proxy dns from localhost:53 to router:5300 and then added "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in resolv.conf.  It works, but I would want to clean up the script or rewrite it in C before deploying.  This is my best solution.
2) I tried "nameserver 192.168.1.1:5300" in resolv.conf, but that syntax is not understood.
3) I tried redirection with iptables on the local host but I can't get that to work --- I'm not sure its possible.  On the other hand, redirection on the router does work by port forwarding with the PREROUTING chain, and I can distinguish on a host-by-host basis, but its a pain to set up something where the user just presses the "switch" button locally and then an iptable rule changes on the router.  I'd prefer solution  to this.
4) The -p option in dig works great, but I don't see how to wrap that in with ordinary DNS queries.
On a different note, there must be DNS caching in tor.  Is there a way to control that without jumping into the code?

Hi everyone,
About a month back I said I would email the list with some measurements
of RAM usage for tor in embedded systems running in the wild.  These
preliminary numbers might be of interest.  Here's what I did.  I ran tor
in a ramdisk environment with only 3 binaries (busybox, tor and
openntpd, statically linked against uclibc) on 1) a i686 box, 4 x
2.80GHz Xeon with 4GB ram (image at
 and 2) a MIPS board (Mikrotik RB433AH) with a 680 MHz Atheros AR7161 and
128MB ram (image at
 After booting, I waited until the systems established themselves as
relay only and directory server nodes in the network.  I then monitored
ram usage as time went on.  Here's what I found:
1) node "simba" = i686 box with
BandwidthRate 150KB
BandwidthBurst 200KB
Day       Total(MB)     Disk(MB)
7            246               30
9            247               31
12          249               31
16          255               31
19          258               33
21          261               33
Here total = total ram usage including paging and ramdisk, while disk =
ramdisk only (mostly due to DataDirectory files)
I did not systematically measure CPU usage, but it was very small.
2) node "mufasa" = mips with
BandwidthRate 40KB
BandwidthBurst 80KB
Day      Total(MB)
1           45
2           56
3           56
4           56
5           56
6           61
7           56
8           56
Given the different way in which the ramdisk was set up on the MIPS,
there was no easy way to seperate paging from disk memory.
Again, I did not systematically measure CPU, but watching top
occasionally, I never saw loads over 0.1 or cpu usage over 10%.
I realize these numbers are rough and incomplete, but they give a ball
park of what's needed.  I'm going to repeat these measurements, but
would like some feedback from the community regarding what you'd like to

used an initrd image in /dev/ram0 which is sized at 128MB.  Immediately
upon booting, "free" reports 133 MB of RAM in use just before starting
tor.   On the MIPS I used an initramfs image and "free" reports 5MB in
use at the same point.  It looks like my i686 numbers are messed up, too
high by 128 MB.

@_subject: Tor memory usage on embedded systems. 
Hi Andrew, this is one approach, but I want a system total, not just the
memory usage on a process by process basis.  It would be nice to be able
to answer questions like "if we want to run a tor exit and directory
server at such and such a rate on an embedded device, how much ram does
the device need?".   Tor needs some minimal OS in which to live.  The
least I could do is busybox + openntp + tor.  The memory requirements of
these processes must be added in.   Also embedded devices run purely in
RAM, so the filesystem contributes to usage and tor needs about 30MB in
its DataDirectory.  This also needs to be added in.  Rather than
identifying all the pieces and adding, which is not the easiest thing to
do without missing something or double counting, the approach I took is
to just ask the system for a total with free.  (Eg. pmap needs careful
interpretaion when adding up totals for more than one process because of

Yes.  I'm hoping in the long run to produce something like
RAM requirements on embedded systems = function of ( tor services
provided, BandwidthRate, other relavent parameters )
where the other parameters may include architecture, uclibc vs glibc
etc.  Not an exhaustive study, but something of a guide to the community

@_subject: Tor-ramdisk 20091123 (i686) and 20091124 (MIPS) released 
Hi everyone,
I want to announce to the list that new rleases of tor-ramdisk are out.
Tor-ramdisk is an i686 and MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux distribution
whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that
maximizes security and privacy.  Security is enhenced by hardening the
kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be
off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to
minimal information.  Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral
memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP.
These releases update tor to 0.2.1.20 and busybox to 1.15.2 on both
architectures.  Users are encouraged to upgrade since these updates
address issues which may effect the memroy-restricted ramdisk environment.
Nodes "simba" and "mufasa" have been running the i686 and MIPS versions
for about one week in the wild.

A new feature was added to both the i686 (release 20090926) and MIPS (release 20090927) ports. The setup scripts and busybox's configuration were modified so that the user can now choose to set up networking either by DHCP or by static assignment.  In all other respects, these releases are the same as their previous coutnerparts.

Thanks Andrew.
Let me just make it clear to the list that tor-ramdisk is in essence
just a Linux distribution, albeit an unusual one dedicated to one and
only one purpose.  Its life cycle is like what we do over at Gentoo,
which is grab source from upstream (when its ready) and bundle it
together into a working distro.
The big difference seems to be that I've never had to send bug
reports/feature requests back upstream.  The code base is well written
and compiles/links no problem on diverse arch's and against both uclibc
and glibc --- kudos.  The only problems I've hit have come from the
hardening with the compiler, but that's our problem in hardened gentoo.

To run a hidden service, you first need to run a service, like a web
page.  To run a web page you need to have some web pages and an apache
server.  You would further need php and mysql if you want a blog or
wiki.  On top of that you run tor.  See
But all the ramdisk image has in it is a kernel, 3 binaries (tor, ntpd
and busybox) and one ash script.  You can't run the service there.  I
guess you could run it on another machine behind tor-ramdisk.
With tor-ramdisk I was just thinking of running a relay or exit node
where you could just pull the plug and poof!  Nothing to see here ...

Hi everyone,
I've had lots of requests to add ssh support to tor-ramdisk [1] because
ftp is insecure.  I originally used dropbear, but after discussion with
Jacob, I switched to openssh.
I'm not providing images yet, but I've got the build scripts up on a git
repo [2].  They're meant to be run on a x86 uclibc system, but might
build on glibc and/or x86_64.  When I produce the images for
distribution, they are built with hardened gentoo, both toolchain and
kernel [3].  This give userland pie, ssp, _FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and the
kernel GRSEC/PaX.
Feel free to grab the stuff and contribute.  I'll throw a GPL-2 in there.

such methods may be inefficient, they may be good enough for some purposes.
It would be good to know what technologies these ISPs will implement to

Tor-ramdisk is an i686, x86_64 or MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced by hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be exported/imported by FTP or SCP.
This release incorporates major changes from upstream to all components of tor-ramdisk: tor was updated to 0.2.2.36, libevent to 2.0.18, openssh to 6.0p1, busybox to 1.20.0, uclibc to 0.9.33.2 and the kernel was updated to 3.2.11 plus Gentoo's hardened-patches-3.2.11-1.extras. The MIPS port also incorporated these changes, but only for this architecture was libevent update to 2.0.19 and the kernel to 3.2.5.

I mostly do gentoo development where I bring kernel and toolchain hardening to uclibc systems.  arm is definitely in sight.  I'm working on the beagleboard and Genesi.
Boot the vps from the iso image as if you're doing an install.  I don't know how rackmount nodes work, but I assume you can do something like that.
I can write scripts for transferring the iso to usb or sd/micro sd card.   Thanks for that link to a amd driven board.
In general, if I have (or were given) access to hardware or virtualization env, I can make a targeted image.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Linux + Tor 
This question has been discussed now a few times on the list.  I'm going to recommend Hardened Gentoo [1] or a derivative distro called Liberte Linux [2].  The reason is that one attack on tor is not to attack the network itself (which is hard) but to attack the client programs on the end user computers along the lines of AcidFox as discussed in Scheier's article [3].  Hardened Gentoo uses lots of user and kernel land hardening techniques to pro-actively prevent exploits, eg. our kernel is patched with PaX to prevent abuses of a process's memory space. Hopefully these memory protection techniques will frustrate even exploits that the NSA might know about that they don't share with the opensource community.  The process itself may have the exploit, but it will be caught and stopped by the kernel.
I am aware that nothing is guaranteed, but every little bit helps here.

We also add haveged, a daemon to help generate entropy on diskless systems, for a more cryptographically sound system.  Testing shows that previous versions of tor-ramdisk were operating at near zero entropy, while haveged easily keeps the available entropy close to 9000 bits. Upgrading is strongly encouraged.

This release updates tor to version 0.2.4.22, the kernel to 3.14.4 plus Gentoo's hardened-patches, and openssh to 6.6p1. The bump in tor adds an important block to authority signing keys that were used on authorities vulnerable to the "heartbleed" bug in OpenSSL, CVE-2014-0160. The bump in the kernel addresses the pty layer race condition memory corruption, CVE-2014-0196. Upgrading is strongly recommended.
