@_subject: Running Tor + Pivoxy from USB stick possible ? 
I want to install Tor + Pivoxy on an USB stick and run it on multiple computers on demand.
Is this possible?
I guess I have to install + start the Tor service on every new computer again.
How do I do that without re-installing whole Tor + Pivoxy again?

@_subject: Exit from Tor, Pivoxy and Vidalia with one click possible ? 
When I start Tor, then 3 icons appear in the SysTray of WinXP:
1 for Tor
1 for Pivoxy
1 for Vidalia
If I want to exit all 3 programs I have to exit them all 3 individually, one after the other:
Is there a way to exit them all 3 at once with only 1 click ?

Can I start Tor with a second, individual "torrrc" configuration file?
In general I want to use the original torrc. But occasionally I want to use e.g. specific exit nodes.
So I must use a modified torrc. Instead of always having to manually edit the one and only torrc
I would appreciate to have a second torrc which I can pass to Tor as starting parameter on command line.
Is this possible ?
Or is there a work around for this ?

@_subject: Problems understanding and using Vidalia Network Map 
Ok I established a Tor connection successfully.
Now I open in Vidalia the Tor network map.
On the left side there are the available Tor servers.
But what connections are in the mid column (below the worldmap) ?
Currently I can see approx 12 lines like
atari,blutorserver,croeso    Open
As far as I know I use only 1 connection at a time. Why are there 12 listed ?
Can I choose one of these connections ?
If yes: How ? I did not found a "select this connection" button/context menu
Is the rightmost server always the exitnode of a connection line?

@_subject: How to dynamically configure an US-IP as exit node? 
Ok, as well documented I can specify write into the torrc file
StrictExitNodes 1
exitnodes aaa, bbb, ccc, dddd
where aaa, bbb, ccc and ddd are Tor nodes located in the US.
The problem with this is that the nodes aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd are not constant over a period of time.
Nodes become removed or inactive. Furthermore other nodes are still alive but other nodes have a better bandwith and throughput.
So is there another way to specify just the country of the exit node and let Tor choose automatically a suitable
exit node from this country?
Alternatively Is there a way to dynamically update the list in torrc file?
I could imagine that there is a tool which searches automatically at startup of local Tor for nodes in a target country
and updates - if neceesary - the old list in torrc.
Is this possible somehow?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to specify exit node country for TorBrowser? 
Assume I downloaded and installed (under Win 7) TorBrowser package from here:
It includes as far as I know everything I need including Vidalia and Tor.
When I start the included TorBrowser (=firefox) then I can access successfully Internet through it
However I miss some configuration settings.
How for example can I define (for this package!) in which country the exit node should be (or not be)?
How do I call typical Vidalia setup?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to get the country of current exit node (+ current 
Assume I specified in the torrc file:
ExitNodes {de},{ca},{fr}
StrictNodes 1
So the real exit node can be in one of the 3 countries.
How do I find out now in which country the current exit node is located?
How can I get the current node chain?
For both answers I would prefer to call a certain special webpage which shows the information.
At least it should be shown in an Addon somewhere in Torbrowser.
I don't want to fiddle around in some local log files.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Use another "torrc" with Tor-Browser in Windows? 
In the (new) Tor-Browser package I have simply to doubleclick on TorBrowser (=firefox) to start the whole Tor architecture
with the default torrc file in
I like it.
However sometimes I want to use a different setup with a different torrc with other exitnodes and configuration.
At the time when users had to start Tor separately I could pass a second torrc by a command line parameter -f like
tor.exe -f E:\browser\Tor\myconfig\torrc123
Since users call/start Tor not directly any more the parameter passing is not possible.
Fiddeling around and editing torrc each switch time is not comfortable.
So is there another way of easily temporarily use a different "torrc" file when starting TorBrowser?
I can imagine that I can pass a torrc through TorBrowser/Firefox anyway like
firefox.exe -pass2tor_own_config E:\browser\Tor\myconfig\torrc123
Thank you

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why does parameter "StrictExitNodes" exist? 
Assume I specified in "torrc" file
ExitNodes {fr},{de],{ca}
According to Tor docs that means that the exit nodes should always (?) be in one of the three countries.
On the other hand there is another parameter "StrictExitNodes" which forces Tor to use an ExitNode
from one of the three nodes. This is confusing.
Why is "ExitNodes" not sufficient?
Is it only a case of probability?
So with only the ExitNodes statement above it could happen that the exit node is in US anyway?
This is strange.
Maybe someone could help me
Thank you

Ok, thank you.
But as far as I understand is now the new command. But the same problem applies here as well.
Assume I sepcify as already said:
ExitNodes {fr},{de],{ca}
BUT NO "StrictNodes 1" command.
Does that mean "You need not obey the ExitNodes" command?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Extend auto-IP-switching-time in TorBrowser (and 
Hello Paul (and others),
the problem is for example when I login into a remote mailbox through TorBrowser then the mail box provider
see my IP (=IP of ExitNode).
Since I often stay longer than 10 minutes in my remote mailbox an IP switch happens during my mailbox login session.
Unfortunately a lot of mailbox provider setup smart "security session procedures".
As soon as they detect an IP switch they force the user to re-login again (at minimum).
Even worse: Some mail providers consider an account and password break and force the user to "verify" that
they are really to owner of the account with a long-winded confirmation procedure.
This could happen when only changing the country as well.
Very annoying.
So the easiest way to prevent these situation would be to keep the current Tor circuit (or at least the ExitNode).
Why not offering the user such a (torrc) option? So its up to him if he wants an extended circuit-session-time or not.
