The browser bundle is for tor clients, not relays. If you want to run a
relay, on unixes, then install tor and configure it as a relay.
We make an assumption that if you are running some sort of unix, you
can handle your package management system, or compile from source, and
edit the torrc file.
You should easily be able to run both TBB and tor as a relay on your
system. TBB on linux and osx randomizes controlport and socksport to
avoid conflicts with tor's configured as a daemon via torrc.
If you are on Windows, we don't have a solution yet for running TBB and
Tor as a service. Well, to be more clear, we have the solution in
randomizing ports, but Windows' anti-virus/anti-malware programs think
tor is malware in this state for some silly reason. So because of these
anti-user programs, Windows' users suffer for now.

From what I can tell, it didn't look like this since 2010. Right. Tor Project's Tor Browser is a part of the Tor Browser Bundle.
And let me be clear, so there is no confusion, we actively encourage
people to take our source code (website, tor browser, etc) and use it,
remix it, and try out new things. This is why we use CC-BY and BSD
3-Clause licenses.
Personally, I don't particularly care if firefox, dooble, or some other
new browser is the core of the Tor Project's Tor Browser. We (as Tor)
want whatever solution is best for the users. Right now, we believe
Firefox is the best solution. With your input and empirical results, we

: - What can be done to stop botnets abusing Tor for concealing its
: infrastructure?
First off, remember hidden services are just an addressing and routing
scheme. They don't actually provide any service at the host. As we've
seen with the Dutch National Police and the Anonymous attacks on hidden
services, they focused on the software behind the hidden service
address. From reading your post, it seems this botnet is just using
hidden services for command and control. Since you can't find the c&c
host, you have to attack the c&c itself or the application running at
the hidden service (likely some IRC software of some kind).
: - What kind of impact would a large adoption by malware writers of Tor
: and Hidden Services have on the Tor network and its usability? Is it a
: serious threat to the project?
The constant churn of hidden service circuits would slow down hidden
services for all. One of the iterations of "torchat" created a unique
hidden service "identity" per contact. This meant a single user with 50
contacts had 51 hidden services on their machine.
: - Is there something the security community and botnet researchers can
: do to help out?
Help figure out the scope of the problem. It's entirely plausible that
this one botnet is an experiment to see if hidden services are reliable
and performant enough to handle a c&c service. One is not a trend,
it's a unicorn (even a brony unicorn).
I'd be interested if gnunet or i2p have seem similar usage by
botnets. Sure, it gets lots of press when someone mentions "Tor", but
at the same time, I can't imagine the entire botnet herder community
jumping into one solution to rule them all.
Overall, I think you'll see more of these types of c&c servers
hosted in decentralized tools and networks. As botnets
are taken down and squeezed out of the naked IPv4/IPv6
address space, the output is plausibly decentralized or
p2p networks. I said this as much to Interpol in September, see
or the source with comments at

Tails is great for this. I trust tor exit relays and hidden services
far more than I trust 'free wifi' and every ISP between the 'free wifi'
and destination. I bet liberte linux is a great choice as well.
In fact, when traveling I use tails exclusively. The new 'non-anonymous
browser' function works great to get through captured portals. If tails
could be installed on my hard drive, I wouldn't need to stand out by
booting off a usb stick and then plugging in my ubikey for passwords.
The challenges with forcing IPsec or a VPN is that you need to either set
it up beforehand or trust a 3rd party to run the end point. If you set
it up beforehand, then the 'free wifi' learns your end point and maybe
who you are (or are likely to be). If you trust a 3rd party, they get to
learn where you roam in the world and how long you are in each location.

bittorrent trackers are fine, it's the bulk download of GB of data 7x24
that loads up the network.
I do this all the time over tor. I trust tor exits more than wireless
networks in hotels, airports, schools, and other locations.  The latest
TBB release allows me to stream youtube html5 videos over tor. In fact, sometimes when I travel, I scp my virtual machines over tor
rather than risk a laptop search and seizure at a border.
I expect that tor the protocol and network should punish me for asking
to transfer so much data. I don't care if my apt-get takes an extra 10
minutes to complete. I don't care if my vm disk transfer takes all
night rather than one hour. De-prioritizing my bulk traffic is fine if
others get webpages, instant messages, and the like through faster.
The trick is, I like to think I know what I'm doing and that I'll
notice if apt-get or my VM image fails to transfer untouched. Whether
I'll actually notice a sophisticated exploit in deb packages or my vm
image modified in perfect way that gpg or sha256 hashes don't detect,
remains to be seen. If I pulled a random person out of a barcamp and
asked them to do a OS X or Windows update over transparently proxied
tor, would they notice if the package was modified in transit? What do
these OSes do in this case? What about freebsd ports? Or other package
systems? What about all of the other software that updates itself
automagically without a system package manager? The details from a central  are fascinating to see
how much stuff on my network uses cleartext data and protocols and
never even check for a sha-1/md5 hash, nevermind .asc code signed
packages. It's also scary to see what never checks if the ssl cert is

@_subject: [tor-talk] Status/progress of TorRouter? 
Torouter is still a work in progress. There are really two projects
here, the one we want to build and ship in scale and the one the
community is building already. The goal of the torouter is to increase
the number of relays and bridges globally. The secondary goal is to
make it easy to use tor through a dedicated device. Both projects are
still so young I don't have a preference for one over the other. My
goal is to get more tor relays and bridges globally. Whichever project
manages to accomplish that first, wins. There are benefits and costs to
both ideas.
# Tor's ideas
The current state is we're working on plans to build our own hardware
to handle the torouter needs. The excito b3 and dreamplug hardware is
great, but costs too much and includes too many other features not
needed in a torouter. Features like audio/spdif, hdmi, 1080p HD video,
bluetooth, etc are not needed and just increase the price of the base
circuit board. We are experimenting with the Freescale iMX53 board [0]
to see if the current ARMv7 chips can handle being a tor bridge or
relay. It also works well as a ARM-arch build system for debs and rpms.
We're working with Bunnie of Bunnie Studios[1], and he thinks the
next-generation Freescale chipset and board are far better options,
because of the ARMv9 architecture and crypto offload build into the
We think this is roughly a $500k project to get the hardware designed,
manufactured, and to create a highly usable, point and click web
interface for the system based on Debian's armhf distribution. We want
to be able to offer hardware torouters, fully packaged and ready to go
for under $75, while still covering ongoing support, maintenance, and
future improvements.
We're currently doing a beta-test of a web interface to Tor with the
excito b3 hardware and around 20 people. I'll let Runa talk more about
how it's going and summarize the feedback from the testers.
There are lots of people excited about this project, but finding
funding to get started has been a challenge. The base hardware we
create can be re-purposed for other 'plug computing' projects beyond
the torouter. We're pondering kickstarter as well as a for-profit
subsidiary to get some funding to turn this into a reality.
And finally, torouter is a poor name. Onionbox is the leading candidate
for a public launch.
# Community ideas
The Access Labs team[2] and others continue to work on their original
idea of a torouter based on openwrt with a luci/lua web interface for
tor. They've made great progress and have their system working on
current hardware on the market today. They are running into the
challenges of running tor in tight environments with limited cpu and
ram capacities. It's a fine challenge to solve, and they are making
progress. Having an actual embeddable tor, which is fully functional,
would be fantastic. It could open Tor up to many more devices.
It's probably at the point where they could start a larger beta test
to ship devices pre-configured with everything. The largest barrier to
adoption is integrating their tor into an existing device. The vast
majority of the world, including the technical community, wants
something that just works. Buying a Buffalo device, installing openwrt,
installing tor, configuring it all for transparent proxying, is more
work than many are willing to do. However, buying a device that is
pre-configured with all of this appeals to many more people.
The future is bright and waiting.

No. TBB disables disk cache completely. What's written to disk is
updated consensus and state files for Tor, temporary files for Vidalia

@_subject: [tor-talk] What's written to HD? 
: Thanks, but I'm still a little unclear. You say "no"- it's basically the TBB workings, but it seems an open question atm? So is there anything else apart from disk cache ...swap files..flash cookies (flash shouldn't be on but if it were, would it also leave traces that wouldn't happen with Tails, a liveCD or a VM?) You asked two questions. I answered both.  The first question
you asked is: "Does TBB write user content to disk?" The answer
to the first question is no, it uses ram cache only. The
second question you implied was similar to "what does the
operating system write to disk while using TBB?" This is an
open question, albeit one with a very old answer located here,
The details on what TBB does is here,
I suppose a third question you imply is "what does tails write
to disk?" If Tails is run from a cd/dvd-rom, nothing. It cannot
write anything to a read-only media. If you run Tails default
setup from a USB drive, it also writes nothing to disk, as
the USB filesystem is mounted read-only. Here's some more info,
Tails runs entirely in RAM with RAM filesystems.
: I'm thinking TBB has more users than Tails - which usually hasn't the latest Tor version either.? So is there anything that the TBB can run inside of e.g a liveCD of some sort, or Tails itself??
And now you blur TBB with Tails, they
are two separate entities. Tor Browser is here,
 Tails as of 0.13,
does not include Tor Browser, but a similarly maintained Iceweasel with
different addons and patches.
Hopefully this clears up any confusion.

These people should just use Tails then. It's simple, it works, and is
plausibly safer for computer novices than trying to explain TBB safety
on a compromised system. The biggest hurdle I've seen with this set of
users is actually getting and installing tails to a USB drive in the
first place. They would much rather buy a Tails USB drive or dvd than
download the iso and make their own.
In my experience, working with newbish users who want privacy and are at
serious risk of harm if they screw up, tails is the best and simplest
option they have today.

have flash enabled by default.
The flash plugin appearing or not is dependent upon adobe flash being
installed in the operating system. If flash is installed in the

the flash plugin in tbb. If you enable flash in tbb, you may lose all

Can they share the data about 'cyber-attacks' and why Tor is chosen as

My guess is they don't have any data and just bought some software or hired a

called 'proxies' which is selected by default. Within this 'proxies'
category are some long-running Tor exit relays. There was a period of

True, but the scenario is the same. In both cases, Apple is a gatekeeper
and gets to decide what can be run or not on your local machine. At
least for iOS, Apple has decided Tor cannot be in the store. There is
some app called 'covert browser' in the iOS app store, but only the
developer knows what it is and what it does. There is no source code
available and I don't believe anyone has, or can due to the ToS, publish
their analysis of the app.
In both cases, the terms of service are fairly hostile to the user and
the developer alike. If Tor is to get into some sort of store, it will
have to be with a separate company and probably some help from
insiders. This is an unfortunate reality with these walled gardens
becoming popular with mainstream OSes.

This is a false sense of security. I believe most of the time apple's cert
for updates and installation will be correct. If the national firewall,
or whatever resident malware, can fake the app store host and cert,
then all security is gone.
Users should not have to provide a verified identity in some way in
order to get TBB. Now this just means not only is my computer owned,
I've lost my identity and financial information too. The normal user is
not going to go through a bunch of steps to register with apple using
anonymous pre-paid debit cards and identity.
There are people reverse engineering the entire app store for osx,
in violation of the ToS. Maybe they'll publish how the app store
really works. And how it degrades when the url is blocked, or when
presented with an invalid cert (like a corporate proxy server). It will
also be interesting to learn how much data is sent back to apple, and how
often. Antivirus/antimalware programs seem to sending lots of usage data
back to their 'clouds' to aid in detection and protection of the user.
Of course, the alternative is to jailbreak your own computer to install
non-app store programs. Expecting users to do this will fail massively.

: : Icons. I wrote desktops. So you have to deal with windows, not icons.
Right. Gnome and Win7 seem to pile all of the tasks from 4 desktops
together on the task bar at the bottom. Now I have 2 vidalia green onions
and 2 tor browser windows, even though they are assigned to different
desktops. Yes, I can change this, but by default, all tasks and icons
are collated together on every desktop.
: Even in TBB?
Likely, the update checks just occur through Tor. I haven't investigated
personas on tbb. My approach would be to open the web console and watch
for all requests from an idle tbb.

@_subject: [tor-talk] flash and tor 
Adobe Flash apps can be written to ignore proxy settings of the
operating system and applications and stream data back to anywhere.
They have access to your hard drive, so they can read data from
anywhere on your system.
The keyword here is "can". Most flash apps work as expected and honor
proxy settings and will dutifully stream/work over Tor. The user has no easy way of knowing if the app is recording their IP
address locally or from their ISP and sending it back to some site, or
just connecting back to a site without using the proxy. For the majority of people, flash is a black box doing unknown things.
This isn't even addressing the exploits and vulnerabilities in the
flash vm (called a player). It may be playing funny dog videos for you
while it is ex-filtrating sensitive data.
Because of these reasons, we determined flash is too risky to allow by
default in tor browser. See  in

Actually, I've talked to cloudflare in the recent past. They don't

treat Tor. I can connect to cloudflare sites by forcing circuits to
exit through non-busy exit relays just fine.

Right. They only look for the attacks and not the 99% of traffic which
is non-attack. If they looked at total traffic from Tor, they'd likely
find the normal usage vastly overwhelms the attack traffic.
Getting some real data here would be interesting. I'm constantly told
by "network security" people with more letters after their names than
years of experience that "everyone knows tor is bad traffic", but when
you push them on it, they have no idea why or even where their traffic
originates at all.  And "everyone" turns out to be companies selling
products or their certification instructor. Protecting networks or hosts based on rumors and hearsay is a pretty
poor way to protect anything. Empirical data should rule the decisions.
Cloudflare, google, akamai, and others would have a pretty good view of
how much traffic from Tor exits can be classified as good or bad. If
only they'd share the data or summarized results. I'm interested in the
answer, no matter what it is.

    - allow to move questions between subsites (if allowed to do so)

  * Fix the display issue in the Ajax search box renders it unusable

  * Add multilanguage feature to:
    - allow users to change the language of the interface they see
    - allow to filter the content by the language of the questions
  * Add askbot to debian wheezy repos for easy installation
It came down to the decision of spending money on fixing and modifying
askbot and making a better tor. We chose the latter.
If some community wants to improve askbot, we'll consider using it in

between more tor or askbot. Again, we're always going to choose tor in

I do this now. I work with various victims of abuse who already trust me,

their own password. A few of these victims have told their advocates and victim's groups

is some website where they can buy such a thing, made by me or people I
trust, on demand. Right now, people hand me USB drives, and I hand it
back with Tails. This is clearly not a way to do business--but I'm not
doing business, I'm doing a service for victims. There is clearly a
market of some size for a trusted supply chain which produces Tails USB
drives for customers.
Right now, I am the dealer handing out sticks on dimly-lit street corners

Adblock whitelists certain advertising companies and ads themselves:
See  and
See  under
"No filters
Site-specific or filter-based addons such as AdBlock Plus, Request
Policy, Ghostery, Priv3, and Sharemenot are to be avoided. We believe
that these addons do not add any real privacy to a proper
implementation of the above privacy requirements, and that development
efforts should be focused on general solutions that prevent tracking by
all third parties, rather than a list of specific URLs or hosts.
Filter-based addons can also introduce strange breakage and cause
usability nightmares, and will also fail to do their job if an
adversary simply registers a new domain or creates a new url path.
Worse still, the unique filter sets that each user creates or installs
will provide a wealth of fingerprinting targets.
As a general matter, we are also generally opposed to shipping an
always-on Ad blocker with Tor Browser. We feel that this would damage
our credibility in terms of demonstrating that we are providing privacy
through a sound design alone, as well as damage the acceptance of Tor
users by sites that support themselves through advertising revenue.
Users are free to install these addons if they wish, but doing so is
not recommended, as it will alter the browser request fingerprint. "

One situation not helping the overall blocking situation is the censorship
companies enable tor blocking by default. Company A buys some equipment,
takes the defaults, and therefore blocks Tor. There was never a discussion
about what should or should not have been blocked. It's automatic in
the firewall/nat/gateway/perimeter device. Our own funders at the NSF
and State Dept have run into this exact situation. The Program Managers
try to visit torproject.org, or wiki.torproject.org, and are told Tor
is a proxy/circumvention site and blocked for that reason. The PM's sane
response is "yes, this is exactly why we fund them!" And then the PM runs
into the bureaucracy of IT and gives up. They then just bring to work
TorBrowser on a USB drive and circumvent their own IT censorship, like
millions of citizens do daily with their governments.

Hello Kus,
Thanks for fighting the good fight. I recently had a similar experience
in Egypt, where just about everyone thinks Tor is for criminals, etc. Yet,
most of them used Tor in 2011 during their most recent revolution.
The first step to the end goal of censorship is surveillance. The
Internet might seem like the ultimate tool for free speech, but without
tools to protect our privacy, unwanted surveillance online can post a
serious threat. Every day around the world, people are using Tor to
protect their online privacy, whether they're concerned about surveillance
by corporations, their government, or someone else. This is also true
for circumventing Internet censorship. Tor, like all technology, can be used for good or bad. Kitchen knives,
iPhones, and automobiles are used every day for both good and bad, yet
no one is advocating a ban of these technologies. If someone starts a
crime wave with crowbars, do you ban crowbars? Then hammers? Then tire
irons? The morality is in the user of the technology, not the technology
itself. The same Tor that's being maligned in the press is used daily
by law enforcement agents to successfully hunt down horrendous criminals
by protecting the identity and privacy of the agent.
Tell us how we can help Turkey defeat this attempt to censor the Internet.
And again, thanks for blogging about Tor in Turkey.

: talks, but was just wondering if this is written anywhere that can be easily
: referenced.
There was an unpublished study in Nevada by some grad students who setup
a few malware defense appliances on the end of a tor exit relay. They
found 3% of the traffic passing through their exit relay was tagged as
malware, by however the appliance was configured to determine malware
or not.
They never published their research because they either couldn't get
ethics board clearance at their university and/or because of the Univ. of
Colorado exit relay issue at PETS.
I read a draft of the paper, which was subsequently pulled from
publication. I've talked to a few organization who allow Tor exits, but
track good/bad traffic (by their definition) who say 3% sounds high from
what they have seen. None of these orgs will go on the record, but they
are some of the largest social network and ecommerce sites in the world.

It would be safe to assume details are still spotty. Until someone
actually publishes a their numbers, this is the best we have.

Hello Derric,
Thanks for joining the list and starting the conversation. Are there data sets or statistics which quantify tor usage at wikimedia? It might help to frame the discussion if we know the scale of the tor usage or the problem we're trying to address.
How does wikimedia handle other proxy and VPN users for logins and edits? Would these solutions work for tor users as well? I imagine the vast majority of tor users are just simply trying to get around Internet censorship of some kind; like that at a national level, public schools, restrictive businesses, or free cafe wifi, etc.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How does Tor help abuse victims? 
Tor is a tool in a toolbox full of options. It alone isn't going to solve all the problems experienced by a victim. Tor Browser, Tails, and Whonix do provide relief from the constant surveillance experienced by victims. They are tools which give back to a victim a small slice of control over their lives. It helps them feel safe for a period of time, when otherwise there are only risks, dangers, and threats.
When working with victims of abuse, the understanding and demystifying of technology is a big help. Helping someone understand how they are being controlled through technology is a huge confidence builder. Helping the person understand how their abuser is using technology makes the other seem far less omnipotent and powerful.
Abuse is about power and control. Anything which can return some power and control to the victim does help in immeasurable ways.
After the victim feels safe, then we can talk about ways to safely communicate with others, such through OTR-enabled chat, Tor Browser to visit survivor forums safely, and other means of safely using the Internet.

Hello Patrick,
Thanks for joining the list and starting a conversation. And thanks for caring how Tor is portrayed in the media, and trying to do something about it.
The first four places I send reporters asking about hidden services are:
1. DuckDuckGo
2. PubLeaks and StrongBox
3. Wildleaks, 4. The Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, There are others out there, but the organizations don't want any publicity at all.

Nothing wrong on this side. My script is this,

I think all of this pushing the website has left the webserver mirroring
process out of sync. Some webservers are up to date, others not.
I just forced a sync to all webservers.

Let the community speak about Tor and tell their stories about usage.
Let the Syrian woman who used Tor get on stage and tell her story,
augmented by technical details of what we've seen in Syria. I think this
is a far better use of an hour at 31C3 than another technical talk about
