Does anyone know a method of obtaining BitCoins anonymously, other than mining them yourself? **bitinstant.com has worked flawlessly for me - I have used it three times now for varied amounts of money. You go to bitinstant.com, set up a cash deposit ---> bitcoin wallet transaction (or Mt. Gox voucher if you so choose). Give them a tormail.org address if you're uncomfortable....they are in the process of setting up UK/Europe options now as well.
You can then go to anyplace that supports moneygram billpay, and use *cash*or any form of untraceable payment you used cash to get (i.e. prepaid giftcard). You are untraceable if you use bitinstant. Their system submits your funds to the specified address within 5 minutes. They even will give you a printable PDF with instructions after you submit the transaction request. They charge a 3.99% comission - that's it. They even cover the moneygram fee for you. The tellers I've paid are always surprised by the fact no fee is required :)
