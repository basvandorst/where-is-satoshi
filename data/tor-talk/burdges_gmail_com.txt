@_subject: [tor-talk] "Hidden Services" vs "Onion services" 
In other words, facebookcorewwwi.onion is an onion service, but it?s not terribly hidden. Private is always a nice word.  I don?t think the ?onion services? which are not so ?hidden? would mind being called ?private?.  It?s worth worrying about whether it?s too strong a word though obviously, especially if the server is some public facing site like twitter, facebook, etc.  Location hidden service is actually pretty good descriptor here in that hidden is less forceful than private.  I suppose you could always call them freedom services if you?re worried about raising funding from the U.S., maybe the moment for that has passed though.  ;)  p.s.  Robert Soare renamed the field of recursion theory to computability theory when the NSF turned down his grant one year.  Recursion theory, now computability theory, is the branch of mathematical logic around topics like Godel incompleteness and Turing degrees, meaning they study differences in how impossible it is to compute things, not anything that?s actually computable.

Adafruit?s Onion Pi is a Tor proxy for your home network, *not* a relay.  p.s.  Instructables has relay setup instructions though, which someone could comment on, but the wolrd has a lot more Android machines that Raspberry Pis, and they?ve much less bandwidth.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Servo 
Anyone looked into Servo yet? Servo is ?highly parallel" web browser layout engine developed by Mozilla.  There is not yet a full web browser based on Servo, so no extension framework, but..
A layout engine?s design could facilitate or hinder extensions like HTTPS Everywhere and Torbutton.  Or even make them largely superfluous. A priori, the Servo developers sound pretty sympathetic to tor's concerns since they work for Mozilla and use Rust for security.  It?s might be worth making friends.  Or even explaining what Torbutton and HTTPS Everywhere actually do. It might help avoid another situation like with Chrome :

@_subject: [tor-talk] Full integration with bitcoin (suggestion / feature 
Worse, it?s a catastrophic weakening of the anonymity provided by Tor, as Bitcoin is only pseudonymous, not anonymous.
If you want anonymous transactions then you want a blind-signing based currency like Taler    as opposed to a blockchain based currency like BTC.  I?m not in favor of paying for Tor relays using even that for political reasons, but blind-signing is necessary to build a transaction model that?s no weaker than Tor.
p.s. Leif talked about a proof-of-onion altcoin idea in which ?mining? required fetching data through onion routing nodes determined by the spinning nonce, etc. and both the miner and any nodes forwarding data earned mining payouts.  In this way, forwarding is paid for by the occasional fake mining circuits, not by users.  You need nodes to sign some traffic, which potentially creates new weaknesses, so not suitable for Tor.  It relevant if you?re trying to launch a different sort of onion routing network though, like maybe a high-bandwidth fail shortage/sharing network, as the coin speculators might help bolster the bandwidth and anonymity.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Full integration with bitcoin (suggestion / feature 
In an RSA blind-singing based currency, like Taler, a mint who issues the currency can track how much money a particular account sends or receives, but cannot discover the actual transfers.   And deanonymizing one transaction does not impact a user's anonymity overall.  In Bitcoin, et al., everyone can track everything about every account at any point in the past.  Accounts are pseudonymous and creation is distributed, but deanonymizing a single transaction destroys the anonymity of the whole account.  And advanced attacks can be brought to bear on identifying sock puppet accounts.  Yes, RSA blind-sinigng assumes the buyer remains anonymous to the seller, like say buying server time for an anonymous website.  Anytime you deanonymize yourself to a seller, like by buying physical goods, then you?re trusting them, this goes for Bitcoin too.  In fact, deanonymizing yourself like this is much worse in Bitcoin.

Just fyi, airport wifis commonly block vanilla ssh, which requires me to do pushes through tor.

I have not but I'm happy to read the article.
Is there a discussion group for onion router and mixnet design?  tor-talk
might be a big generic for this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] HORNET onion routing design 
I've no read much of the NORNET article, although not yet carefully enough,
very interesting.
Yes, sounds highly problematic.  I'd imagine one could add a bloom filter
for nonces like I2P has though.  It's nolonger zero state, but a tiny state
you can amortize anyway you like, including not checking every packet and
peers warning one another.
It's not clear to me that routers sending an extra 344 bytes is better than
routers storing only their FS or similar and some route identifier.  Would
this not depend upon application properties?
It appears possible to extend NORNET to handle both routes using an ADHR
and routes that store route information on the servers.  Applications could
select the style of routing themselves.
Or is there some property of large networks that makes routers being
stateless inherently better?

I couldn't even find the NORNET tech report they cite, just shows up as
"anonymoizedurl" in the paper.

Yeah, I've understood the difference now :
- Sending the full AHDR costs O(m^2) where m is the length of the
- Doing local look ups costs at most O(n log n), maybe less, but the n is
the number of clients using the router.
It doesn't matter that even the constant on the first line is much higher
too, being bandwidth, because m is bounded and n grows.
But in a real implementation, some kind of replay resistance would be
Appears there is no need to change the protocol to address this though.
It's an orthogonal problem to amortize those checks better as the network
grows using bloom filters, spot checks, warnings between routers, etc.
p.s.  Appears NORNET routers could tag the FSes they issue to connect
packets that lie in the same (directed) circuit.  It'd be an interesting
exercise to prevent this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser is already running 
I'd thought this worked if you ran :
cd ~/tor-browser_en-US
./firefox --class "Tor Browser" -profile
./TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default/ Appears not anymore however.  In fact, the "New Window" created by the
start-tor-browser.desktop file in launcher/favorites no longer works either.
There is perhaps a -no-remote option being set in the profile used or
something, or maybe the firefox adds it due to another option.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anyone actually using a local exitpolicy? 
There is a comment in the torrc man page that exit policies can target the
local machine or private networks, like say :
ExitPolicy accept 127.0.0.1:80
ExitPolicy reject private:*
Does anyone actually do this? If so, how does one use it?
There are no ip address limits specified in the consensus according to :
egrep "^p6? " /var/lib/tor/cached-microdescs | grep ':'
There are several possibilities for what this means :
(1) Tor does not bother to list such exits because their private.  duh!
(2) Private exit operators suppress inclusion using another option, or
(3) nobody does this.
Assuming the awnser is (1) then how does one use the access the local exit
created?  Is it perhaps : set Nickname not the server, set AllowDotExit 1
on the client. And access localhost.foobar.exit:80 or similar?

Fair enough, but if anyone asks me then I?ll still tell them how to use ssh over tor since that addresses protocol censorship more broadly.

As an aside, there is a broad tendency towards using sites that make discussions more efficient through a mix of search, organizing, and ?local topic focus?, ala stack exchange : Tor has one here : Although arguably it should use an open source platform :
