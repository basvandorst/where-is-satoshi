@_subject: [tor-talk] how to setup transparent proxy on FreeBSD using ipfw 
I want to setup transparent proxy over tor network on FreeBSD using ipfw
because its native to FreeBSD.Tor's wiki about transparent proxy says that
only PF is supported but in manual it's written in TransProxyType option's
description: set this option to "ipfw" to use FreeBSD ipfw interface. I
find any information or tutorial about how  to setup local redirection
through tor
using ipfw. Is it possible achieve what I want? Is FreeBSD ipfw interface
in working state or its still developed?
