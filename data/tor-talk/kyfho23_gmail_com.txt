Thank you for a singularly cogent explanation,Bob. It also explains why I get so little spam thru my gmail account.

@_subject: Wikipedia & Tor & ... moderators? 
A suggestion on this:  I just remembered the "hidden" servers....there was one listed on Privoxy's page, I believe, that can only be accessed by someone using a tor/Privoxy combination. Perhaps our possible Chinese dissident could post her/his edits and additions on such a server, have them reviewed by someone at Wikipedia, and if they were non-vandalizing type posts, they could then be added to the Wikipedia page.
    I realize that this violates Wikipedia's open-source, anyone can edit philosophy to an extent, as someone would have to read and review these entries. It would also put additional burdens on Wikipedia's staff. But it would allow both the free flow of information and the protection of privacy.
    As an experiment, this might be tried on Wikinews first.
    Ladies and gentlemen, I humbly submit to you that the rights of the individual (Tor) and the availability of fora for the expression of free speech (Wikipedia) are both measures of how a civilization's progress. If we can figure out some sort of solution to this, we'll have solved one of the great problems of our age.
Whereabouts Unknown ;-)

"How can we avoid discussing politics when it seems to intrude
That's the pernicious part of politics. As long as which ever group is in power has the ability to give goodies to whom they want, it'll keep up.
Not just money, either...many lobby's aren't seeking money, but having the rules made in their favor.
Power corrupts. Absolute power is kind of neat that way.

a creash is what happens when a crash fold,spindles and mutilates your
data. alternatively, you should have a nice creash in your trousers when
you're trying to explain to the constable that you haven't had too much
to drink.
Hope that helps. 8-)

First, thanks to everyone who contributes to this list, to the
development of Tor, the TorCP, Vidalia, and if any of the authors of
Privoxy are around, those fine folks. I've learned a lot just lurking.
    I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with BellSouth (the
FastAccess DSL service) and their policy towards running an intermediate
(non-exit) node. Alternatively, where do ISPs usually have this
information, (what search terms to enter at the site)?
    I mention this because I'd rather not get nasty letters about
"abuse", but also want to contribute, and with the new Vidalia control
panel, it seems a lot easier. I don't have money to contribute, but I
can run a relay node...my little blow against the system.
    Also...anyone who doesn't have a Gmail address and wants one, knows
someone who wants one, or knows some site thats passing them on...get in
touch with me: kyfho23 at gmail.com . Seems silly to have 100 of the
things, and no takers.
    Again...thank you all for the education & hard work (I know from my
limited experience that coding is tedious). And thanks for believing in
Christopher W.
