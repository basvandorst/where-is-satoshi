Ok, I think I know what's happening..
You need to execute:
Not just by /Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor
When your system starts, your system execute it with parameter "start"
automatically, and when it shutdown, it should also issue
It a script that takes three different parameters, either start, stop,
or restart. (restart pretty much executes start and stop

Same as yours...did you put it in /Library/StartupItems/Tor ?
It will not work unless you actually put in "Tor" directory. (In other
word, "Tor" file inside this archive must match with directory name.
After you install, what will have if you do:
sudo /Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor start?

Umm, actually it's tor-0.0.9.1...
I don't think I've seen trojan like that with previous Tor releases, though.

Oops, I'm sorry, here's a file (if attachment works...)
Put these files this into /Library/StartupItems/Tor
I'll upload the same file into appropriate directory tonight, as well.

Try Included is a set of script file to start up tor.
There might be some case it won't start up right after restarting, in
that case, you may have to manually issue command like 'killall tor'
(In my purpose, I've just put that line in stop section...

You should be able to run HiddenService behind NAT.
I used to do it all the time.
No, it's not requirement that you run as a server.

For those of your experiencing the problem with ZoneAlarm, you might
want participate in ZoneAlarm 7 beta testing program. It seems like
they would want to know about those crashes.

Tor was just covered in Japanese media. (NHK)
I haven't seen it yet (it won't be coming to Japanese channel in the
States until 20th...) but it'd be interesting to see how this will
affect Tor metrics.
Incidentally, I was actually interviewed by NHK about what Tor is
useful for, however, had to be cut because of time constraints :-(

As far as I know, Winny was (and probably is) still leading file
sharing client in Japan, followed by Share.
I think an issue of Perfect Dark was that it is relatively hard to
configure compared to Winny/Share, and given there are already some
prosecution cases with Perfect Dark, perhaps that really didn't make
it better choice than Winny/Share to users.
Note that after the introduction of the revised copyright law in Japan
that makes it a crime to download infringing materials, beginning
October 1st, it looks like some metrics are showing significant
reduction in active nodes.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: [PET] Japan to possibly/partially block Tor? 
As far as I know, Mainichi news press (the newspaper company who
originated this report) jumped on the gun, and it wasn't actually
accurate report to begin with.
As the English version of Wired News states:
[UPDATE 24/04/2013] This article, and its headline, originally stated
that the panel's recommendation that "the internet provider industry
and other entities" referred to ISPs being asked to block the use of
Tor. It has since been clarified that the NPA wishes for individual
site administrators to be responsible for blocking Tor users.
The case that involved Tor and caused a bit of controversy because of
so many false-arrests (and forced confessions) is ending with no
prosecution due to no material evidences; so I wouldn't be too
surprised that it is NPA's real wish.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Systemd error with v0.2.7.5 (git-6184c873e90d93b2) 
Hash: SHA256
I might have spotted some issue on the latest update through apt-get on
Ubuntu 15.10. (I used source installation through apt-get because of the
OpenSSL version mismatch error.)
Basic symptom was that tor was restarting every two minutes or so. (I
have, after this update was performed, started noticing intermittent
disconnection from SSH session through hidden service, then I found that
it was getting terminated at some interval.)
I do see "[warn] Unable to send readiness to systemd: Unknown error
- -13." that seems to be indicating the root of this problem.
I am little puzzled as I could not find any further information on
debug.log but it looks like Tor is having problem communicating with
systemd, and it seems to be tor at default.service is killing the process,
hence "Interrupt: exiting normally" showing on the log. I have further
observed that tor at default.service never transition to "activating" to
"active" on systemctl status query.
I could work around the issue by changing Type=notify to Type=fork on
[Service] section of tor at default.service. But I wanted to drop a note
here to see if there's anything I can check or try as it seems to be
searching for this error doesn't really present much of information
about this particular issue.
Thank you!

It turned out this was caused by AppArmor.
kernel: audit: type=1400 audit(1448884032.655:58): apparmor="DENIED"
operation="sendmsg" info="Failed name lookup - disconnected path"
error=-13 profile="system__tor" name="run/systemd/notify" pid=4903
comm="tor" requested_mask="w" denied_mask="w" fsuid=132 ouid=0
Which turns out to be reported ealier
 at lists.torproject.org/msg86057.html
Although, it looks like workaround by adding
to AppArmor profile is no longer functioning, so I ended up disabling
the profile altogether...
