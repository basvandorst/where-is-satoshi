+1. Enable unattended-upgrades and security updates for _all_ your
system components will be handled, which is much better than just
updating Tor.

Hash: SHA1
Indeed - sadly, the only workaround here if it's an IP you use for
common browsing is to run a bridge.
It's worth chasing up any sites/operators/list maintainers who list
relays and pointing out how guard/middle relays pose no risk to an
IP's reputation. Exit relays are another matter, of course, and most
of those lists *should* be listing those IPs. Sites/operators choosing
to outright block those IPs with no recourse isn't ideal, of course.

To an extent - dictatorships can also competently and systematically log
The UK is in a very similar policy position, assuming the proposed
bill for investigatory powers goes forward (which it almost certainly
will); anyone who is an ISP can be compelled to do practically
anything. This includes tampering, interference, etc, with data or
equipment, owned by the ISP or not. Tor relay operators in the UK
could be legally compelled to provide access to government and gagged
from discussing it, for one worst-case scenario. This is much worse
than the Danish model, as far as I know.
The interesting questions, at least to me, are around how this changes
the threat model, and how capable Tor is at dealing with attacks that
take advantage of a well-equipped, legally mandated adversary
attempting to deanonymize users. While this isn't the stated goal of
such legislation, it could certainly be used in this manner.
