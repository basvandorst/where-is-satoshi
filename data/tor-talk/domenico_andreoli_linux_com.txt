@_subject: [tor-talk] Revoking a hidden service key 
The unvoidable single point of failure is the loss of control on a

Isn't possible to require multiple nodes to sustain a single hidden service?
So that loosing control of a single node doesn't compromise the whole service.

Thanks for all those who spent effort in making this turning point possible.
The more exit nodes are available, the less they can be blacklisted.
