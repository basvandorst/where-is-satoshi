@_subject: all traffic through a VPN on top of tor, done! 
Can one use a node listing like this:
and then alter ones config to only connect, and build circuits with, nodes with greater than X bandwidth ?
Looks like there is 50+ nodes with greater than 1 MBps bandwidth ...
I suppose it's reasonable to assume that malevolent/compromised/government nodes will be higher in the bandwidth chart ?  So perhaps the top 50 nodes represents far less "anonymity" than a randomly chosen 50 nodes ?  Hard to Another option would be to build your own co-located network of 10 (or so ?) nodes, and use them as a pool to build at least two out of three hops with ?  That way you're getting high speed, but you "trust" the overall circuit because you know that at least 2/3 of your circuit is not I asked this question a month or so ago and did not see any answers - if one _did_ build a small (10 or so nodes) network of tor relays and used them as 1/3 or 2/3 of all circuits built ... perhaps allowing 80% of their bandwidth to be used by Tor proper, and (secretly) saving 20% for themselves ... is that a medium, low, or laughable amount of "anonymity" ?
If it's laughable, what's a good number ? 20 ? 100 ?

@_subject: all traffic through a VPN on top of tor, done! 
Yes, but back to my thread hijack :)
Let's say my protection model does indeed require Tor, but at the same time requires "more" speed.
Forcing Tor to only use fast nodes probably doesn't work, since those fast nodes are probably inundated just like the slow ones are.  This also suggests that organic growth in the Tor network is not going to solve much of the speed problem in the near term...  existing users will certainly use more and more traffic.
But lets say one sets up X Tor nodes in X different locales and configure my Tor to use one of those X for my entry, and one of those X for my exit ... I'm still throttled by my middle hop, but the odds are much higher in my favor, and I may only need to rebuild my connection once or twice to get an acceptable speed.
The question is, what values of X are required in order for correlation, etc., to not be laughable ?
(the assumption here is that I put my X Tor nodes on the actual Tor network, but reserve some percentage of their bandwidth exclusively for my own use ... so they look and act like actual Tor nodes ...)

Ok, that is perfectly sensible.

It's just a thought - I realize your problem is the real-world assurances that people need when they are really under survelliance, and not some rich white guys IT hobby.
Thanks very much for a very helpful reply - I appreciate it.  It will be interesting if you conclude that X is larger than (the current size of the public Tor network)  :)

This is a very, very slow node (46 KB/s in this mornings TorStatus) but it is interesting to see nonetheless - thank you.
So people are doing it, and packages exist, etc. - since my own interest is in private Tor networks, or possibly "virtual" private Tor networks (as we discussed a month or so ago on this list) I am particularly interested in whether there are performance advantages to be had in running Tor on dedicated network hardware.
Clearly not in the case of this r24k based system, but I wonder if there is an advantage to running Tor on larger pieces of network infrastructure that might have features like hardware AES and so on, vs. continuing to run on commodity x86 based servers.  This assumes several hundred to a thousand megabits/s of traffic ... otherwise, who cares.
There are some public nodes running at 100 (or so) megabits/s - I'd love it if someone could speak up about what that looks like on the system.  It might save some more of this "load" conjecture  :)

@_subject: hardware acceleration available for Tor ?  On FreeBSD ? 
You discuss the performance benefits of using the AES CTR in hardware below, but before I get to that, I wonder if you experienced the same as what is quoted just above:  that the real CPU load occurs during "the asymmetric-key processing (i.e., onion-skin encrypting/decrypting)" and that that is the only area where we can attempt to speed things up with hardware ?
Thank you very much for your testing, blog post, and this exchange.
So, if I understand correctly, the HardwareAccel option can be turned on by anyone, regardless of OS or hardware platform.  It will then (probably) just do AES CTR with OpenSSL (since most people use OpenSSL) and just get no benefit because OpenSSL won't do AES CTR through hardware.
So, even if I got a BCM5825 working with with the ubsec driver on FreeBSD, and used HardwareAccel, it would just be wasted with OpenSSL.
On the other hand, there are Solaris-specific routines (crypto framework APIs (PKCS built into Solaris that Tor can call instead of OpenSSL, which _will_ do AES CTR in hardware, yielding a huge gain in performance (you mention 25x).
Do I have all of that correct ?
If so, some follow-up questions that I hope will be of help to others:
- Are there analogues to the "crypto framework APIs (PKCS in other OS's ?  What is this layer called for Linux, for instance ?  For FreeBSD ? Or is hardware AES CTR with HardwareAccel something we're only going to see on Solaris for now ?
- How does the T2 (Niagara 2) compare to dedicated hardware such as the Sun Crypto 6000 which is currently available ?  Presumably the crypto framework APIs will use whatever is available, whether it be a SCA-60000 or a Broadcom based card or ... ?
- Am I correct that if a new version of OpenSSL appeared with AES CTR hardware support, an end user could just proceed blindly with card insertion, driver install, add HardwareAccel=1, and poof!  Yes ?
If I am correct in the above, it would appear that there is a nice, platform specific feature in Solaris to complement a specific CPU feature in T2 (and later, I hope) processors, and that the correct path for the rest of the world is to lobby OpenSSL to implement hardware AES CTR so we can just plug and play.

SCA6000 is pci-e, so it will not work in a e450.  The e450 does, however, have 64bit pci slots, so the old SCA-1000 would work there.
However, the SCA-1000 does not do AES at all, even with the v2.0 firmware, so my previous discussion (and ebay link) should be ignored.
The (also discontinued, like the SCA-1000) SCA-4000 does AES, but does not appear to do AES-CTR.
Finally, this page:
shows that the BCM5825 will work in Solaris.  I think this is the best option provided that the AES-CTR support it provides can be accessed in the same painless way that it can be in the T2 chips.  Wyllys ?
The BCM5825 board, off the shelf, costs less than half of what the SCA6000 does ( $462.50 at  (see "pxs2510) vs. $1350 ).  A cursory review of the specs shows that they both run bulk AES @ 1gbps and 12,000 RSA tps for the broadcom vs. 13,000 RSA tps for the sca-6000 ... smells like the same part, actually, but I can't confirm that.
... and since I'm dumping my brain here, we read at:
For our newest SPARC based servers that fill the same target area that many V240's are used for, particulary ones with an SCA-500 card (SSL web serving) the UltraSPARC T1 (Niagara) machines (T1000 & T2000) will do the crypto much faster, faster even than the new SCA-6000 can achieve. The key value for an SCA-6000 in an UltrSPARC T1 is the key store; which the SCA-500 and SCA-1000 didn't provide.
So ... with newer sparc systems, having a SCA-6000 or BCM5825 might be overkill - unless you're focusing on performance-per-watt, in which case a T2 system with a few SCA-6000s plugged in might raise the bar quite a bit.
But that begs two questions:
- Do the crypto framework APIs (PKCS efficiently use multiple compute sources, such as a dual-processor T2 system with four SCA-6000 plugged in ?  Wyllys ?   :)
- Is any of this useful for any conceivable Tor traffic loads ?  The fastest Tor node I have ever seen on the status page is (roughly) 100mbps, which is a lot, but ... more than a pair of modern quad-core CPUs can handle ?  It's conceivable that even at 200 or 400 mbps you wouldn't need any kind of crypto hardware to supplant a pair of modern CPUs...

Streams (ATi) under FreeBSD. :-(
Yes, it continues to be a disappointment that CUDA is not available on FreeBSD or on Solaris for that matter.
It's interesting to note that this is not idle chatter - it appears that CUDA is a reasonable platform for AES in hardware:
and further, Nvidia documentation provides instruction and sample code for doing just that:
They specifically mention CTR mode:
"The decryption for CTR can be done following the same steps. Thus we can encrypt and decrypt each cipher block independently, giving us the benefit of true parallelization."
I'll bet ops per watt and ops per dollar are all better on the purpose-built encryption hardware ... it would still be more fun to connect a few quadro plex external units to my Tor node.

I'd like to see some stats, or even some conjecture, as to the longevity of a bridge, and what it means for the bridge to be born, be used, and eventually be blocked.
I understand the mechanisms used to slowly feed bridge information to people who request them, but even that slowness can't keep them from eventually being discovered and blocked.
I would think there would be some kind of exponential falloff in utility of a bridge as it is extant for longer and longer periods of time.  You might be able to analyze this by looking at the relationship between the number of times a bridge IP is given out vs. the bandwidth it generates and then provide some guidelines to bridge operators that would give them an idea as to when to move to a new IP, or when to expect their bridge to have gone stale.

@_subject: Planning to build private network 
Does anyone have any comments or sugestions for the person that posted the below, about one month ago ?  I was very interested in this topic, but there were no follow-ups ...
I am currently planning to build a private TOR network for 50 users.  The goal of the network is to provide anonymous browsing and access to hidden services for the group while trying to avoid the low speeds seen in the public network.  The users will not be using the the network for file sharing or high bandwidth applications like streaming media.  The group currently uses the public network, and 12 are hosting relays.  The main complaint from the group is that the public network is too slow for comfortable use of some internet applications. (No big surprise)
I have a few questions.
1) Will a private network address the speed concerns if built properly?  I have read considerable amounts on the subject of TOR's speed, and understand that the number of relays is not the overriding concern.
2) If the answer to 1 is yes (i believe it is), what would be the optimum number of relays to ensure privacy and speed? Is there a formula that determines the number of relays need for X number of users, with a say a 3 hop path? What about hidden services?  If there a rule of thumb for determining the number of exits to relays?
3) What would the minimum specs of a individual relay be? How much bandwidth per relay should we strive for?
4) Assuming we build it properly, and do not abuse it, what kind of speeds can we expect from the network?

I am aware that I may run a private Tor network if the speed or latency of the public Tor network is unacceptable to me.
I am also aware that failing to reach a critical mass of nodes and traffic will leave users' anonymity much more vulnerable to attack.
I don't know what the numbers are, in terms of minimum acceptable nodes or traffic, but I suspect that I don't want to arrange or
maintain it.
On the other hand, I do control a fair amount of infrastructure and bandwidth in multiple locations ... so it's very tempting to leverage those resources in a way that gives me tor-like anonymity, but without the (sometimes terrible) speed and latency.
Is there a middle ground ?  Is it possible for me to simultaneously contribute network resources to the public Tor network, allowing me to blend in like every other Tor user, yet at the same time somehow leveraging the specific resources I control to achieve faster speeds for my own use ?

Hello David,
Thank you - that does help.  So you are always using your own exit nodes, and usually using public Tor for hops 1 and 2, but sometimes using yourself for entry ?
What makes the determination, for you, whether to use two public Tor hops vs. just one (the middle) ?
I suppose a converse of this is that you could put private nodes in your "route" so as to run your traffic over four or five hops (instead of the default three) without the typical speed/latency costs.  So, increased speed for three hops, or no speed loss for 3+X hops...
But that still leaves the undefined anonymity loss, which appears to be Thanks again - any additional comments you may have are appreciated.

@_subject: Some misc. exit node questions ... 
First, am I to understand that this list is referring specifically to ISPs that allow exit nodes ?  Presumably a relay node is not deteted and your ISP does not care ...
One problem with this list, however, is that it deals mostly with residential, end-user Internet connectivity, while I would think that IP transit service, or co-located service (or even VPS) would be much more useful to the Tor network.
Other than the reasonably good notes on rackspace, are there any other exit-node-friendly providers that are providing something more than a home cable/dsl connection ?  I wonder specifically about he.net, as I consider their ipv6 tunneling, and the running of the lightning.net irc server as very clueful and abuse-tolerant activities...
Second, what is the bandwidth (a)symmetry of an exit node ?  As it is an _exit_ node, I am assuming that a very large ratio of the traffic is outbound traffic.  However, I understand that just because a node is an exit node does not mean it cannot be chosen at any given time as either an entry node or a relay node, and therefore the traffic should become more symmetric.  So, if I run a fairly stock/standard exit node configuration, what percentage of my traffic will be outbound ?
Finally, any comments on running an exit node for only ports 22,80,443 ? These are the only ports I ever use, and the absence of port 25 and 6667 certainly removes a large amount of abuse ... if I throw a lot of bandwidth at exit nodes doing only those three ports, will that be a noticeable boost to the Tor network, or do people need more flexibility than that ?

If a full service datacenter gives a multi-rack ISP a /24 or /22, and then that ISP sells a half rack to a VPS provider who sells a VPS to an end user who then runs an exit node ... does a police contact ever even make it to the end user ?
Finally, what generalizations can be made about the behaviors that eventually lead to a police interaction ?  Is it a website on the public Internet that is either taken over, or run from day one as a sting, and they collect the IPs that connect ?  Is it news postings that appear to come from a particular IP ?  I don't see a raid coming as the result of a hidden service - where would an IP come from to point to that ?

No, no - I understand what the behavior in meatspace is like - I wonder what the behavior looks like on the network.
Take carding ... presumably that all takes place on 443, as carders use online merchants to either test or use the cards.  I'm guessing meta-carding (forums for trading, etc.) also take place on 443.
Spam is on 25.  System intrusion could be anywhere, I guess.
I assume that the child pornography is either in the same places as the piracy (bittorrent on well known ports and usenet ?) or also on 443 ...
And round it out with DoS and other foolishness on 6666/6667 (irc).
Are these fair generalizations, and thus I could start to guess about a "safer" exit node configuration ... perhaps 22 and 80 ?  I would think an SSH based BBS for trading pirated/illegal content must be very rare, if not non-existent, and nobody would be doing serious lawbreaking on plain old port 80 ?
In reality, I run more open than just 22 and 80, but I'd like to know if this line of thought is going in the right direction at all ... can we even make generalizations about TCP traffic policy decisions that will minimize police contact ?

@_subject: tracking locally originated traffic from an exit node ... ? 
If I run a relay with no exit policy at all:
reject *:*
and I personally, as a logged in local user of the system, initiate traffic (like, say, download the wikileaks torrent or posting on a website using lynx, or whatever), I suspect that traffic sticks out VERY clearly to an outside observer ... there's nothing but SSL encrypted traffic going to the ORport and DIRport, and then all of a sudden there is plain old HTTP going to non-tor relays.  Very clearly this is non-tor traffic and is "interesting" to an observer.
However, if I run a relay with a relaxed exit policy, and I as a logged in, local user of the system initiate traffic on ports that are open for exit, isn't that traffic very well obfuscated to an outside observer ?
Note that this is not the common "can I use fewer hops" question, which has the usual answer RE: correlation attacks.  That situation involves an observer trying to prove a positive.  This is the opposite - an outside observer would need to prove a negative: "this traffic I see coming out of the exit WAS NOT caused in any way by the tor traffic I see using it as an So ... if I've got a 5 or 10 mbps exit node with a healthy list of connections, can I use lynx locally to browse anonymously ?

Ok, I'd like to address both cases...
There's really no way they could see latency unless they had compromised the system itself.  I'm speaking of logging on locally to the tor node itself and using a console based application, so only I would see the latency ...
As for the speed, that may be the case, but I don't think it's _necessarily_ the case.  That is, it might look interesting that particular connections were high bandwidth, but is there anything implied literally in the code that would preclude that ?

And then later you alter that exit policy a bit:

My understanding is that this system will continue to be used as a non-exit relay, but will then also be used as an exit.  That is, it's not going to be monopolized by exit traffic only ... it will do both, right ?
If that is the case, is the distribution random ?  Or is there some expected ratio I should see between non-exit relay traffic and port 80 exit traffic ?
Have I complicated that ratio by having a very restrictive exit policy, or doesn't that matter ?

Running a Tor node is an all or nothing proposition - either you accept fully the ramifications of a personal identifier (no matter how flawed it is) being tied to this subversive activity FOR ALL TIME, or you don't.
If you don't, you have options - prepaid visa cards, coffee shop wifi, throwaway yahoo accounts, etc.  You can get that Tor node up and running in a completely untraceable manner without much fuss.
OTOH, if you _do_ accept it, then by all means, run Tor from your home Internet connection.
But the middle ground is off limits - you do not run Tor from a personally attached Internet connection and then:
a) complain about the ToS that YOU signed off on (a common thread here)
b) come up with lame workarounds in a misguided attempt to somehow otpimize this situation.

It has occurred to me that while I do believe that slapping the badexit label on nodes like gatereloaded is both bad engineering and an unsustainable administrative model, it's NOT necessarily a loss of function.
That is, if I do indeed have a bizarro use case, and can't talk about it, as we were arguing about, I can still use the "badexit" labeled nodes as I see fit, yes ?  Or do you drop badexits out of the directory after some amount of time ?
The obvious next conclusion is that, since the flags are simply human signifiers, you might reserve "badexit" for nodes we actually see altering packets, etc. (as has been the case), and implement a new tag ("nocrypt" or something) that is explained to end users as "don't use this exit node unless you know what you're doing".

I think these reasons should be worked around or ignored.
I think you, and others on that side of this argument have a very, very myopic view of the constraints and non-technical decisions that go into running a particular node - exit or not.
Rich white people in the north can just trade some dollars for co-location, exercise their free speech, and argue back at the police, as their equals, when they come calling.
That's not the case for everyone - and even in those rich, white countries, there are political and economic ramifications for running a Tor node, exit or otherwise, that seem to have not occurred to you.
No, there is no _technical_ reason to operate an exit in this fashion. There is no reason, from a myopic, borderline autistic view of the externalities involved, to run an exit in this fashion.
However, I can think of many, many reasons to:
- run a node with no contact information
- run a node with an odd set of exits
- run a node with plain (unencrypted) exits
- run a node with odd (non standard port) exits
You have absolutely NO FUCKING IDEA what a node has been deployed for, who is using it, and how many layers of subterfuge are being employed between the external function and the true function underneath.
Further, the power of a platform such as ToR is in the arbitrary extension of the base set of capabilities, and many, many different models of subterfuge, trust, anonymity, etc., can then be built - at arbitrary levels of complexity - and you are chopping those off at the knees.

Hello Gregory,
I am trying to suggest two things here:
1) We cannot know the answer to this (what is their reason, what is their scenario, what is their threat model)
2) There are uses of ToR, and roles that ToR plays, that are very, very different than the official, accepted use model.
So let me back up one step here and state some things that I am sorry are not obvious:
- you have no idea what kind of things run over ports like 21, 23, 80, and 110.  I know what _I_ use them for, and you know what _you_ use them for, and we know what's in /etc/services, but you are forgetting that anything can run over a TCP port.
- you have no idea what particular network activity, or services provided, is considered suspicious in a particular setting.  _I_ can run services on arbitrary ports and so can you, and so can most anybody, but you are forgetting that there are threat models wherein this is not the case.
- you have no idea what type of overall architecture someone has fit their ToR use into.  _I_ use ToR in the typical, accepted fashion, and so does most everyone else, but perhaps ToR is used as simply one component, and maybe not even the most important component, of a larger network - you have no idea what the overall goal of sending and receiving traffic on the ToR network is for a person or group.  _I_ use it like you do, to perform normal Internet functions anonymously - but others may have very different needs, ranging from simple traffic generation to plausible What frustrates me so much about this whole conversation is that the above items (and we could all come up with many more) are true in general, but are never more true than they are related to ToR.  Further, since we're all technical people here, it should be second nature to us that the POWER of an open system are the arbitrary combinations that arise from a simple, unrestrictive ruleset.  There are a small number of easily identifiable "cons" to letting an exit run like this, and there are an unlimited number of unknown "pros" to letting an exit run like this.  You should know this.
I am suggesting fringe, and possibly temporary use cases that imply actors that probably aren't going to pop in to talk shop.  I'll say it again:
There are a small number of easily identifiable "cons" to letting an exit run like this, and there are an unlimited number of unknown "pros" to letting an exit run like this.  You should know this.
Forgive me, but this is a near-perfect example of a straw man logical fallacy.  My not protesting these other items (which I may or may not support) does not suggest that my above argument is faulty.
Again, you are limiting your view to "free people who are donating resources for the world".  Yes, that is how I am involved in ToR, and how you are involved in ToR, but you completely discount the people running ToR nodes on the other side of the sword, so to speak.  They're not in it for you and me, and they're not in it for the EFF - they have an immediate communications need that has both purpose and constraints that you and I cannot imagine.
Ok - how about if we were all speaking Hebrew here, and you had only temporary access to trusted computing hardware, and the node in question was something you risked your life to dead-drop into your local CO ?
You'd have no problem doing a quick chat with us about your exit policy ?
I'm sorry - I really mean to be constructive and cordial here, but you're stuck in a worldview that not only views /etc/services as a set of hard, physical laws, but further cannot abstract farther out than your own, very lucky and very limited use of ToR.
Disclosure:  My bet is that gatereloaded is a "bad" exit and is doing something nasty.  I just don't think this small set of known dangers is worth throwing out an UNLIMITED set of unknown benefits for.

Hi Geoff,
That's fair.
Instead of stressing the boundless set of "pros", I will discuss a single, specific "pro", and that is the idea that open, arbitrary systems provide a foundation upon which to build surprising and unexpected combinations.
I wouldn't think that a group of technical people, much less a group of technical people immersed in network architectures would need this explained to them.
Then again, I didn't think we woud be referring to /etc/services as hard, physical laws, either.  You live and learn, I guess.

I was not aware that "the plan" had evolved into a 1:1 mapping between ports you usually use in cleartext and ports you usually use enciphered.
So, if my exit has TCP 19 open ... what will you accept as a suitably secure chargen ?  What about 37 ?  I don't know of a standalone time protocol that is encrypted ...
Since there is not a clear 1:1 mapping of cleartext and not ports (we _can_ agree on that, right ?) then I suppose some system of "weights" will have to be applied.  How would this weigh out:
21, 23, 25, 53, 1337, 2105, 5555, 32245
There are four TCP ports that you usually use cleartext, and four that you usually use encrypted ... is that exit policy acceptable ?  Or do you assign different weights based on how well you know the protocols ?  I've sure never heard of "MMTSG-mutualed over MMT (encrypted transmission)" so ... I'd assue a low weight.
But then what about the malicious operator that takes a few seconds to post to or-talk and "explains" their exit policy that didn't weight out properly ... then what ?  Is it a panel of three ?  A panel of five ?  Are there appeals ?
I'm going to abandon what I thought were slam dunk philosophical arguments against this notion and just sit back and wait for the implementation proposals.  For the lulz.

a) transaction costs and time overhead for this are extremely high - really, really terrible
b) it is VERY VERY quick and easy to nym-leak, even for smart people, even when they are trying hard
c) this strategy is an all or nothing one - either you get it completely airtight, end to end, every time, or you walk away from the identity.  You don't just sit on your couch and surf over to the remailer site.
