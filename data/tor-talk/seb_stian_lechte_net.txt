Hi everyone,
Please do not give money to node operators. This will complicate matters
and bring in the wrong people. I support sharing costs for a node in a
small group of people, but don't make it a way to receive money from
anyone - there will be people who abuse it.
It might also have legal implications. Receiving money for a service
might render it a 'business', to which other rules (like keeping
logfiles of forwarded connections or something) might apply that will
bring in yet other bad things.

@_subject: Asynchronous bandwidth limiting 
Hi everyone,
I plan to set up a tor node later this week and have been reading
documentation and different wikis. I have found how I can limit the
total bandwidth the server will consume.
My hoster only limits outgoing traffic, but as far as I understand, it
is not possible to specify bandwidth-limits separately for incoming and
outgoing traffic.
Would it be good to be able to specify limits for outgoing or incoming
traffic separately, or would that only complicate matters without
providing any benefit?
Do incoming and outgoing traffic/bandwidth even differ significantly?
Does this depend on the type of node and exit-policy (if any) one uses?
I have no experience and have not found specific information on this, so
I hope that the list members can provide information on this question or
provide directions for further reading.

@_subject: Asynchronous bandwidth limiting 
Hi everyone,
just a quick follow-up on what I've done:
I have disabled the directory on my server to
a) ensure maximum bandwidth and traffic are available to OR
b) ensure symmetry between incoming and outgoing bandwidth/traffic usage
I have currently established both limiting and accounting to see which
performs better. Depending on the distribution of load on my node I will
probably adjust these values.
It has been pointed out to me in a private eMail that I have mixed up
'asynchronous' and 'asymmetric' in the my eMail's subject line. For the
record, it should have been 'Asymmetric bandwidth limiting'.
Thanks for the help and hints.

@_subject: 27C3 on Tor 
And I thought this was why it says somewhere in DOCs or FAQ that a user
can better hide what she does if her own tor client also transmits relay
traffic. This is the strongest point of tor against other anon systems
with less users: The more people use it, the more likely it "wasn't me".
It would be interesting to experiment if a relatively low RelaySpeed
(e.g. 10KB/s) setting would already attract enough traffic to always
sufficiently hide the users own activities.

@_subject: 0.2.1.27 rebinding or-port on HUP? 
Hi list,
I've upgraded my bridge relay from 0.2.1.26 to 0.2.1.27 yesterday. While
rotating logs a HUP gets issued. The log shows:
Dec 08 03:10:06.854 [warn] Could not bind to 0.0.0.0:443: Permission denied
Dec 08 03:10:06.857 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to
bind one of the listener ports.
Dec 08 03:10:06.857 [err] Reading config failed--see warnings above. For
usage, try -h.
Dec 08 03:10:06.857 [warn] Restart failed (config error?). Exiting.
The config has "User tor", the daemon gets started as root. After
dropping priviledges, binding to <1024 might fail.
Is the rebinding of the or-port on HUP a new "feature"?
Do I have to update the RC script to include any new options to make
this work?
What else could have caused this, if anything?

@_subject: 0.2.1.27 rebinding or-port on HUP? 
I found the cause for this: Connecting Vidalia to this tor instance
modified the configuration. Since I did not configure this instance
inside Vidalia, it disabled the Bridge, causing tor to unbind the
unneeded listener. Reenabling the listener after HUP failed.
Can Vidalia be modified to connect to a running tor instance without
modifying that configuration?

@_subject: 0.2.1.27 rebinding or-port on HUP? 
I run 0.2.10 compiled from source, since the Gentoo ebuild wanted to
pull in tor as dependency ;) I did not specify custom build parameters.
I run tor on my NAT gateway, a headless linux box. I use Vidalia to
connect to it over my internal LAN. Vidalia's (partly default) config was:
[ ] Start the Tor software when Vidalia starts
[X] Run as a client only
and Control address, port and password on "Advanced" tab.
Pressing "(>) Start Tor" on Vidalia Control Panel connects to the
running tor instance. The following shows up in tor.log:
(timestamps removed and long lines shortened for readability)
[notice] Your ContactInfo config option is not set. [...]
[warn] You have a ControlListenAddress set to accept connections from a
non-local address.  [...]
[notice] Tor 0.2.1.27 (re57cb6b9762a2f94) opening log file.
[warn] You have a ControlListenAddress set to accept connections [..]
[notice] Closing no-longer-configured OR listener on 0.0.0.0:443
[notice] Tor 0.2.1.27 (re57cb6b9762a2f94) opening log file.
[notice] Closing old OR listener on 0.0.0.0:443
[warn] You have a ControlListenAddress set to accept connections [...]
[notice] Tor 0.2.1.27 (re57cb6b9762a2f94) opening log file.
[notice] Renaming old configuration file to "/etc/tor/torrc.orig.1"
[warn] Couldn't rename configuration file "/etc/tor/torrc" to
"/etc/tor/torrc.orig.1": Permission denied
It seems obvious that Vidalia configures the running instance via the
control connection. And that would be totally fine if that was the
instance that Vidalia spawned itself, but in this case I want to stop it
from happening.
I could try to mirror the tor configuration in Vidalia, so that no
changes occur, or divide bridge and client functionality to two separate
instances. I'd rather just flip a switch in Vidalia ;)

@_subject: tor and resolv.conf / ipv6 
Out of lurking:
I run a bridge, the same host has a resolving nameserver, so resolv.conf
had "nameserver ::1" as only line. I had to add 127.0.0.1 for Tor to work.
I think it might not be that common that a host would have ONLY v6

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor client pushing large amounts of data? 
My local tor client runs 0.2.3.7-alpha. Just now I stumbled upon this:
Heartbeat: Tor's uptime is 2 days 6:00 hours, with 0 circuits open. I've
sent 48.04 GB and received 992.41 MB.
I don't run a bridge and don't run hidden services. Nothing in my usage
makes me expect the large 'sent' value. Is the counter wrong or do I
want to investigate further?

How so? I'd expect much lower values, not higher.
I think it would help to post the bandwidth history:
Tor's uptime is 6:00 hours, with 3 circuits open. I've sent 4.01 GB and
received 419.10 MB.
Tor's uptime is 12:00 hours, with 3 circuits open. I've sent 4.02 GB and
received 696.57 MB.
Tor's uptime is 18:00 hours, with 1 circuits open. I've sent 4.03 GB and
received 831.90 MB.
Tor's uptime is 1 day 0:00 hours, with 3 circuits open. I've sent 4.03
GB and received 877.31 MB.
Tor's uptime is 1 day 6:00 hours, with 28 circuits open. I've sent 32.03
GB and received 880.58 MB.
Tor's uptime is 1 day 12:00 hours, with 0 circuits open. I've sent 48.04
GB and received 989.46 MB.
Is there significant overhead for many small packets, eg. HTTP requests?
