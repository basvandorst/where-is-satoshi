Is there a list available on the Tor directory servers that my script could parse and get the latest exit routers along with their fingerprints?
I've found this: it doesn't mention whether each one is an exit router
And this: doesn't contain which are exit routers

The script would fetch the the latest tor exit node fingerprints and loop through each one connecting to  via SOCKS5.A failed connection means the fingerprint is discarded whereas successful ones means it is added to a database of usable tor exit nodes.
I see a descriptors list with fingerprints and exit policies. If I understand you correctly then I would have to check the exit policy section of each tor router (accept / reject / ip / port) to determine whether it's an exit node and able to satisfy my connection request.
