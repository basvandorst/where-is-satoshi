@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems with TBB in Qubes and whonix in Qubes 
Dear tor talk mail list.
I have a problem with trying to install TBB in Qubes, I used Micahf Lee's guide: And almost everything worked fine, got TBB build in VM. But when I use the sudo yum install QubesIncoming/tbl-builder/torbrowser-launcher-*-1.noarch.rpm script, it says No package QubesIncoming/tbl-builder/torbrowser-launcher-*-1.noarch.rpm avaible. Everything up to then worked fine. Any suggestions to whats wrong?
My second problem is with whonix work station in qubes. Step number four in this guide it won't extract the libvirt to IMG Hope you can help me with these problems.
