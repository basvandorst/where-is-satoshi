@_subject: [tor-talk] What is going on with /var/run/tor? 
Why would you like to run tor as root? U mad bro?
Do the following:
chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/run/tor
Now tor shouldn't complain 'bout the wrong usergroup anymore.

@_subject: [tor-talk] socks connect 
HI That's because the DNS requests are not made through Tor, so Pidgin
can't resolv the hidden service onion URL. You need Polipo or Privoxy
running, configure it with tunneling everything through Tor (don't
forget the DNS requests!!!). Lastly you need to configure pidgin to use
the local privoxy/polipo port as a socks5 proxy.
