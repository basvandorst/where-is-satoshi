@_subject: Tor overwhelms my router 
I finally had to shutdown my Tor server because my Linksys WCG200 NAT broadband router can't keep up with Tor and 3 other clients on my LAN.  The router does not crash outright, but I lose DNS and pings become I have throttled bandwidth to 150Kb/s and that didn't seem to help.  I thought about limiting the number of connects but I read recently in this forum it is not recommended.
Can anyone suggest a suitable NAT router for use in a LAN that can handle Tor traffic?

Thanks, Adam.
The only driver update available for this product is for Windows USB, there is no firmware update.
