@_subject: [tor-talk] tor browser without tor 
Hi, I normally use Thunderbird & Firefox trough Tor w/instructions from "Toiyfy" & Tor button, the last update from Firefox made Tor button to send several message errors, making almost impossible to navigate at all.
I'm aware of the benefits of using the Tor browser, the problem is that I barely use firefox, the main use I have from Tor is with Thunderbird, so I have to use Tor (via Vidalia) almost all day long, which makes using Tor browser a problem, because it launches a 2nd instance of Tor.
Is there any way of launching Tor Browser without Tor?
Or... is there going to be an update in Tor button?
Thanks in advance

Tanks Sukhbir and Roger, I'll give Torbirdy a tray and see what to do about Firefox.
