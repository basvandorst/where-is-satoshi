Right, TorBirdy is not completely ready yet. But if you are using
Thunderbird with Tor, TorBirdy is a much safer option than configuring
Thunderbird manually.
Version 0.0.11 is available from Mozilla add-ons [0] and from GitHub [1].

TorBirdy requires that you have Tor installed. So, the best solution for
you is to use the Tor Browser Bundle, ignore the browser if you don't
need it, and use Thunderbird + TorBirdy.
We don't have any documentation yet (we are working on it), but if you
have any questions regarding TorBirdy, you can ask them here.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Towards a Torbutton for Thunderbird (torbutton-birdy) 
The Message-ID used by Thunderbird consists of two parts: the Unix
timestamp in hexadecimal format (which matches the time in the 'Date'
header) and a random number, the former being the reason why the
message-ID is considered 'harmful'. tagnaq's paper [0] discusses this
and proposes a time independent message-ID for Thunderbird.
[0] - Yes, there is no way to change this using the configuration settings.
It is possible to do this by setting the 'TZ' environment variable
[1], however that introduces a new problem: Thunderbird then uses UTC
as the dates on emails also and this may confuse/ irritate the users.
We are currently working on the date and the message-ID issue.
[1] - This has been taken care of, 'mail.smtpserver.default.hello_argument'
is set to '127.0.0.1' to prevent hostname leaks.
Thanks for helping us test this out.

Not done. Please explain why do you think this is useful, that is,
what type of information can be leaked? :)
There is no concept of 'toggle' in the Torbutton for Thunderbird --
the only way to enable/ disable it will be by restarting Thunderbird.
So IMO this is not required.
We are aware of this issue (tagnaq's paper [0], Section 3.6.5 explains
this in detail). Because there seems to be no way to disable this from
within Thunderbird, we are currently working to skip the auto
configuration wizard by forcing the use of the manual account
configuration. I think we should have something ready soon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy 0.0.13 now available from Mozilla Add-ons 
Mix+TB Test:
No, we don't change these. Any reason we should be closing them?
There are two preferences in TorBirdy that we need to change to allow/
prevent Thunderbird from checking for messages at startup; this is
because of how Thunderbird handles this. Both changes should be made
using TorBirdy's preferences as TorBirdy will override Thunderbird's
preferences on startup:
* The first is the account-specific preference ("Check for new messages
at startup") that needs to be enabled per account.
* The second is a global setting: "Select last accessed mail folder on
startup", which also needs to enabled.
Enabling this will select the last accessed folder (usually Inbox) when
Thunderbird starts and not 'Local Folders', thus enabling checking of
messages at startup for all accounts that have the first option enabled.
By default, we select 'Local Folders' (the second option is disabled) to
prevent Thunderbird from automatically logging in and checking for new

Mix+TB Test:
I think I could have worded it better.
No, we don't change these on purpose, but this is a side effect of
selecting 'Local Folders' on startup to prevent automatic checking of
messages. So when you enable the preference "Select last accessed mail
folder on startup" (disabled by default), you will find that the message
pane and quick filter are in the state you expect them to be, reflecting
the last accessed account.
I hope this is clear now. I know this is not as clear as it should be;
we will address this properly in the documentation.

"It's still quite experimental - of course. Use at your own risk and
especially if you're using it with Enigmail and GnuPG without a local

  TorBirdy now enforces the safest HTTP proxy usage possible with GnuPG
    TorBirdy attempts to disable all name resolution in GnuPG due to a
    serious SOCKS5 problem with GnuPG proxy options in how we invoke
    GnuPG; GnuPG only supports SOCKS5 when it is linked against libcurl

Like we have said before, TorBirdy is still experimental. The timezone
is not leaked, as we are setting it to UTC. Only the time is being
leaked in the message-ID and date field.
"General content anonymity caution note:
TorBirdy has known leaks in the Message-ID and in the Date header, we're
working on merging an upstream patch that will allow these leaks to be
closed. There are no known proxy leaks unless you use additional
extensions that do not respect the proxy settings of Thunderbird. If you
use GnuPG and Enigmail, we encourage you to use it with a local HTTP
proxy due to the issues mentioned[0] regarding GnuPG."
We have	 submitted the patches to Mozilla [0] and they are currently
being reviewed. Meanwhile, if you want to apply these patches yourself
to a custom Thunderbird build and then use TorBirdy [1], they will plug
the date and the message-ID leaks, as we remove the date header (and let
the MTA do the job of inserting that) and generate a time-independent
message-ID header.
[0] - [1] - Is TorBirdy completely safe? Not yet, but we are getting there! Is it
safer than manually configuring Thunderbird (or other mail clients) for
use with Tor? Definitely yes. I think you should give TorBirdy a try and
see if it matches up to the kind of anonymity you expect it to and then
perhaps make the switch to use it with your main account.
Also, please use 0.0.13 and not 0.0.11, there are many important bug
fixes. 0.0.13 will be available from Mozilla add-ons soon (we have
submitted it for review) [2].

There are two GnuPG packages in Debian: gnupg (without libcurl and which

 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.

 This package contains the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl,
So you need to install `gnupg-curl' which supports SOCKS. We will also

For future versions of TorBirdy, we will either ship it with shim (most
likely) or allow users who want to configure gpg with libcurl to specify
the requisite proxy settings.

Bry8 Star:
Yup, lots of people have asked for this and we should allow users to set
their own custom length and not enforce the 72 character limit.
I have opened a ticket for this: Yes, this is enforced. See:
Like we discussed before in tor-dev, this is related to:  where we are just fail-closing Enigmail. At this stage, I am not sure
whether we are going to support custom settings for this as we have
plans to ship our own HTTP proxy or shim, so for now, I suggest you just
change the port on which your HTTP proxy listens to 8118, which is
TorBirdy's default.
The design approach is that we enforce the settings we think the user
should not be changing. We have gradually allowed many settings to be
changed (like the `mailnews.wraplength' above) but I don't think we will
allow changing of all the security settings that we are configuring. As
bad as it seems, we think it is a good approach as one badly configured
setting might render the entire point of TorBirdy useless.
That's a good idea and we are working on this so that the operation is
more transparent. We have started updating the docs.

You should use port 993 (SSL/TLS) for all IMAP accounts if you want to

setting :)
No, it's not circumventing Tor, but the connection to the mail server
is being made over port 143, which in insecure and the exit node can
see all your traffic. The "normal" setting in this case is the default
setting of port 993 which you should not be changing.
PS: You should probably change your password, just to be sure. If you
think that you changed other security settings, a good way to restore
them is to reinstall TorBirdy. When it runs for the first time, it
automatically sets the recommended security settings for you, which
are the ones you should be using for communicating with your mail

Some feedback, mostly related to the UI/UX, so this may very well be a
personal opinion but I will still comment because I really hope we use
this to distribute the bundles.
- the background looks nice but we can probably use something simple
just to make sure that it is accessible
- the (A) and (B) for the download links should be redesigned. I
honestly was clicking on the name of the bundles instead of (A) and (B).
Also, the download source (Github/Amazon) can be reflected more clearly
- is it possible to use this without signing in to your Google account?
- checksums for some of the bundles was not working (the page would go
to the top instead of displaying the checksum)
- sorry, couldn't resist -- it's TorBirdy and not Torbirdy ;)
Very well done though! The hash generation takes the prize above all!
Please keep us informed about the development.
