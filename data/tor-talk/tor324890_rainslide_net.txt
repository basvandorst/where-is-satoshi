The green icon means Tor is enabled from your computer. Now you need to configure your web browser to use it. To do that, change its proxy to use SOCKS5 (sometimes just SOCKS) on localhost, port 9050 (unless you've changed the default port).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-unfriendly List 
Is there a list of 'things' (services, web sites, etc.) that do not work well with Tor? For example, connect to MSN using Tor and you'll find yourself being banned.  refuses to work with Tor. Such a list would be useful to check before trying to use such services, I think.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Debian Repository GPG Key 
When doing an "apt-get update" after adding
deb  squeeze main
to my apt sources list, I get:
W: GPG error:  squeeze Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 74A941BA219EC810
How do I get the public key?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Setting up Tor on Ubuntu 
I had problems with Vidalia seemingly randomly overwriting my tor rc file with its default settings, so I stopped using it. Now, I just run the tor proxy itself.
I'd do what you originally intended: keep it simple, you want to learn tor so just run tor alone for now. Get back to the position you were at when you just had tor, no Vidalia, and you've confirmed it's running with nmap. By default it'll run on port 9050 - nmap should confirm that, so you should set your proxy setting in your browser to localhost:9050. Set your browser to manual proxy for now, just to eliminate 'system proxy' from the equation.
When tor started up, its log file should have said something about confirming that it's running. 'telnet localhost 9050' should leave you with a blank line waiting for input (IIRC). That confirms that something is listening on port 9050.
Visit a web page in your browser. There's a test page that you can visit which detects and shows you whether your browser is using tor. I can't remember what page it is, but a simple search for it should tell you (search for it before you do all this, otherwise you might not be able to do a web search for it!).
Where exactly are you seeing the error? In the browser, tor log file, system log?

Nope, same symptoms.
Already running one. I think no matter what local DNS server I use, as long as it goes through Tor, it's not going to get the response I need.

I wonder if those could be related to my problem with connecting to their XMPP service (see thread titled 'DNSPort & googlemail.com').

@_subject: [tor-talk] DNSPort & googlemail.com 
When using DNSPort to resolve googlemail.com, I get the 'wrong' address:
$ host googlemail.com
googlemail.com has address 173.194.41.150
Host googlemail.com not found: 4(NOTIMP)
Host googlemail.com not found: 4(NOTIMP)
It should be something like:
$ host googlemail.com
googlemail.com has address 74.125.230.150
googlemail.com has address 74.125.230.149
googlemail.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:4009:801::1015
googlemail.com mail is handled by 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
googlemail.com mail is handled by 40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
googlemail.com mail is handled by 30 alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
googlemail.com mail is handled by 10 alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
googlemail.com mail is handled by 20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.

============================== START ==============================
Well, I don't know why, but whatever server that is, it won't allow me to connect to their XMPP service. Putting it in the hosts file doesn't work.
