Your home connection is not the bottleneck when it comes to tor.
Consider running a middle node!

An upgrade from 25meg to 100 meg won't give you improved tor speed because
tor cannot handle anywhere near 100mbps. Fastest I usually see is around
1.5 to 2 MB/s. Well within reach of your old 25meg plan.
However, faster speeds are always better! So keep the 100meg connection and
consider donating some of that wonderful bandwidth to the tor network. The
safest and easiest way is to run a middle node.
