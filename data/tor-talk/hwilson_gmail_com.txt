Hi all,
I'm looking for a good way to use Tor for accessing email on OS X.  It  seems like Thunderbird is working with the torbutton plugin.  But I'd  prefer to use Mail.app.  Is this possible?
Do the proxy settings that torify Safari apply to Mail.app?
What is my checklist to make sure Mail.app isn't leaking IP information?

That seems to not be true.   Right now Tor is not running, safari  shows the privoxy error page, and mail.app is still able to send and  receive mail from gmail.

I tried restarting Mail.app with Vidalia on and Tor disactivated.   Mail was still able to access messages.
Is IMAP through SOCKS?  I'm just using Privoxy, and not using a SOCKS  proxy.  I guess that's the problem?
Is SOCKS a solution?  I saw there was some issue about it having  identifying header information.

Hi everybody,
Does anyone know how to "torify" a desktop blogging tool like ecto?
Can I just point it to privoxy/blog.com and rest assured that all  communication is anonymous through tor?

Thanks for the suggestion.
What's my best bet for using it on OS X?  Can I use it with QEMU  running a Mac virtual machine on OS X?  I'm looking to create a work  environment I'd be happy using every day, so switching over to linux  or XP isn't really in the cards.
What about the Parallels virtual machine?
Would Tor VM make POP and IMAP email anonymous as well?
