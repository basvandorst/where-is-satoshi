@_subject: Firefox through Tor 
I'm happy to announce a new Firefox extension which is built with Tor in mind from the ground up.
FoxyProxy - I took the things I liked about SwitchProxy, TorButton, ProxyButton, QuickButton, xyzproxy, etc. and added a number of crucial features:
* Tor Wizard - now zero configuration to use Firefox with Tor
* Define proxy use based on URL patterns using wildcards and/or regular expressions: now you can route *.onion domains and web mail accounts (gmail, yahoo, etc) through Tor but not CNN and Slashdot, for example, without having to constantly change Firefox's proxy settings.
* Define multiple proxies
* No more wondering whether or not a URL loaded through a proxy: FoxyProxy includes a complete log of all URLs loaded, including which proxy was used, which pattern was matched, timestamps, etc.
* Temporarily or permanently dedicate all URLs to go through a particular proxy
* Temporarily or permanently disable use of a proxy
* FoxyProxy hooks directly into Firefox via XPCOM--this yields much greater performance than the de facto standard of updating about:config preferences programmatically (used by every other proxy extensions I could find)
* Lots more
I hope you enjoy it. I look forward to your comments.

Hi Mike,
Forgive my ignorance. What is I2P?
True, but I don't see how this is a result of FoxyProxy. IOW, doesn't
this problem exist when using Tor exclusively without FoxyProxy?
I'm not sure I fully understand the problem yet (please elaborate),
but if you're asking whether XPCOM allows one to use a proxy on/off
based on a page and all its components (images, css files, js files), the
answer is yes.

Hi Michael,
Now that I understand I2P, perhaps you can respond to the rest of my email?
The problem you identify does not seem to be any more or less exacerbated by FoxyProxy; the
problem, if I understand correctly, exists regardless of whether not one uses FoxyProxy.
So when you say "If you can't solve this problem automatically, you should be sure to
warn users of these side-effects", I'm not sure why I should warn them. Can you explain further?
Thank you,

Hello Michaels,
I apologize for the delayed reply. Please don't interpret the delay as
a lack of interest--it surely isn't.
Quoting Mike Perry:
I hope you'll both agree there's nothing FoxyProxy can do about this.
Unless you have a striking relevation which could solve the problem
programmatically, I'm just going to add this to the FoxyProxy FAQ as a
"be careful" warning in an attempt to educate.

Yes, I do now. Thank you.

I forgot to mention that if a URL doesn't match any patterns defined in
FoxyProxy, FoxyProxy *does not* default to a direct connection.
Instead, it defaults to the whatever proxy (if any) has been defined in
Firefox's Connection Settings.
By defining Tor as the proxy in Firefox's Connection Settings, Tor is
used as a "catch-all" for non-matches.
I'll shortly be adding blacklist capability to FoxyProxy (it already
has whitelist ability). That, in conjunction, with the above
"catch-all", should provide enough ingredients to come up with some
safe recipe for some of the problems both of you describe, no?

WSH might be easier for you:
1. Since you can use JScript and VBScript, the learning curve is easier than PowerShell especially if you already know those languages or Javascript
2. WSH does not require .NET so it will work on legacy Windows systems like Win98/WinME.
The main site for WSH is  If you choose WSH, you'll need COM or ActiveX objects which wrap the winsock API. There are literally dozens of such objects available for free, including at least one from Microsoft (Winsock Control). However, you might find COM objects specifically targeted for WSH easier to use, such as this one. Please do your own research and analysis though; I haven't used these objects and am not endorsing them. The nice thing about using the Microsoft Winsock Control is that many people probably already have it installed.
Here is sample code showing how someone used the Winsock Control with WSH JScript. I'm sure you can find lots more samples if you search.
 If you choose PowerShell, you'll want to use the classes in the System.Net.Sockets namespace. They are managed classes wrapping the native winsock Win32 API functions.
Good luck,

These scripts are free in the Microsoft world, too. There are many repositories of free scripts--just google. As for signaling being native to Unix for 30 years, that's like saying WM_CLOSE has been native on Windows since 1992. Why doesn't Unix support WM_CLOSE?
In other words, why would you expect Windows support a Unix-specific instruction. Windows is not Unix and never claimed to be. Do you expect VMS and other operating systems to support Unix instructions?

Hi clowndevil,
Your .vbs works very well, thanks alot. I took the liberty of modifying your .vbs to use the
SHUTDOWN and NEWNYM pesudo-signals.
I am going to write a Wiki entry for installing
Toolsack and using these verions of your .vbs: HUP,
SHUTDOWN and NEWNYM.
Toolsack runs on all versions of Win32 from 98 to XP
so this should prove very usefull to many, many
Windows users.
The only downside I see to your method is the
requirment of Toolsack.  Do you have any idea how
portable Toolsack is?  On second thought, I could just put Toolsack onto a
USB and create a .reg file of it's registry entries
(via. RegShot) to be executed on the local computer
(Win32 OS of course).  This way I could have Tor,
Vidalia, Toolsack and your .vbs on my USB for complete

----- Original Message ----
Sent: Saturday, August 5, 2006 10:45:19 AM
The short answer is that we don't want you to do that. The reason is that
you'd be building a new circuit for every request, and building a circuit
puts a non-trivial load on the Tor servers. If everybody tried to build
new circuits often, most circuits would fail to be built (because the
Tor servers can't keep up), all the Tor servers would run at 100% cpu,
which would ultimately cause the operators to stop running the servers.
We know this, because a few years back we experienced it. At that point
the default amount of time for rotating circuits was 30 seconds, rather
than 10 minutes.
While I'm at it, there's another point to make. Tor only rebuilds a
circuit if the previous one has been used. So we don't put any load
on the network except when we're actually browsing the web or whatever
we're doing. This lets the available Tor servers (700 or so) time-share
over the number of users (several hundred thousand, but not all active
at the same time). So the critical lesson is that we need to make sure
that the tools we write that help us use Tor don't make frequent requests
to Tor while we're not actively using it.
Hope that helps,

Steve, you can open sockets and send data down them natively in Gecko-based apps... and the XPCOM components are scriptable, so you don't have to write any C/C++. So, there's no need to write an command-line program to send the plaintext down the socket (only to launch it from Torpark). Let me know if you need pointers.

Okay,  so  i  COULD  send the plaintext signal to the control port and
have  success  under win32. I thought you said this, but questioned my
memory once i read the code.
The  reason I ask about winking nodes is that I added a button to kill
the  tor  process.  When  torpark  notices  that  there is no longer a
tor.exe  process,  it  restarts it. Occasionally the tor process would
instantly  exit  for  some reason, too infrequent/inconsistent to tell
everyone to log, but frequent enough to be an annoyance. The upshot is
that  if  you  want  to flush your tor circuit, you can simply click a
button  on  the  toolbar  and  it  gets  you a new circuit. I did this
because  often a user will be surfing and circuit fails for one reason
or another and they have to shut down and restart the browser to get a
new  circuit.  Because the process is so dirty, I am worried about how
it may affect the tor network.
I still have yet to heavily research making torpark actually talk with
tor.exe  instead  of  kicking it around. I wonder if it is possible to
pipe  these  plaintexts  directly to the controlport with some command
line program.

Although it's marketed for Windows Vista, it works with any NT-based OS (e.g., XP, NT, Server 2003, etc) and is a free download. WIth PowerShell, you have native access to any .NET and/or COM object--including socket wrapper objects.

I read the thread "Tor Question" and I am curious
about sending the NEW NYM signal (among others).
Could someone please detail or post links describing
how Tor pseudo-signals can be used with Win32 NT (XP)?
 I am physically disabled and would prefer the use of
command line (or other methods) if it is at all
I wish to make a batch file that will send a NEW NYM
pseudo-signal to Tor before the batch starts Gaim-IRC
(for example).
I read Rogers response to Arrakistor and was hoping
someone could shed a bit more light and detail:
How does one connect to the controlport and send the
string "signal new nym"?
I am also interested in a pseudo-signal for gracfully
killing Tor when I am running a node.  What signal is
used to gracefully shutdown Tor so the node does not
does not break any LongLived connections?
Thank you for any help given, Anogeorgeo

Isn't it more likely that rather than blocking it, they monitor who uses it (i.e., who connects to entry points?)

Secret rendezvous addresses for tor dir servers aren't necessary. In China, for example, all network traffic goes through government-owned firewalls and routers, just like the traffic at your workplace goes through company-owned routers and firewalls. The traffic can be sniffed and logged without blocking it. That way they know who's using tor. It's probably valuable to know who's trying to be a dissedent and what it is they think they're discussing privately.
As for a protocol to keep that hidden, SSL comes to mind. Personally, though, I don't believe you can ever be truly anonymous or secret, so I act accordingly.

Firstly, let me say that I'm by no means a tor expert. It would be better if Roger or Neil weighed in than relying on my opinions. I'm seeing this as a nightmare.  If it isn't possible to disguise the fact you're using or serving tor--and last time I did a tcpdump on my outside interface, it stuck out like a sore thumb--doesn't that undermine its usefulness?  I'd be willing to bet that In some countries the very act of disguising communication is as criminal as transmitting illegal payloads. In a similar vein, in some U.S. states, the penalty for refusing to take a DWI test administered by a police officer is often as harsh as the penalty for DWI conviction itself.  (And I assume you mean SSL could be used to encrypt content, not the destination of a tor server.)  Right. If connections could be posted in such public, mainstream, or embedded in innocuous ssl, that might prove well. Perhaps it could be retrieved from  an anonymous proxy service. Quite simply, it seems that you have to  launder the data and appear to be getting it from an innocent data source.
Two comments: (1) what's to prevent gov't agencies from detecting the IPs of the anonymous proxies by themselves using tor? (2) As I suggested above, I tend to think some countries illegalize the act of encrypting communication by its rank-and-file citizens. I don't know enough about SSL to know whether or not SSL traffic can be sensed by a third-party even if not decrypted. I would think so, however.
In any case, I can't imagine that none of this hasn't already been discussed -- probably ad naseum -- by the tor community in the past. I'm sure if we search the mailing list, these topics will appear.

To summarize: what if each configured proxy had its own set of cookies?
As you switch (manually of automatically) between proxies, the relevent
cookie set is used. Each cookie set would be stored in its own silo,
preventing the need for clearing of cookies and also preventing
"cross-over"; that is, cookies written when proxy "x" was in use could
not be read when proxy "y" is in use.

If you can't afford a new hard drive, be sure to wipe it using DBAN

@_author: Eric H. Jung

Everything I've read about the Guttman method suggests your statement
isn't accurate. For example, this is from the DBAN FAQ:
[start quote]
Q: Is the Gutmann method the best method [for wiping magnetic hard
A: No.
Most of the passes in the Gutmann wipe are designed to flip the bits in
MFM/RLL encoded disks, which is an encoding that modern hard disks do
not use.
In a followup to his paper, Gutmann said that it is unnecessary to run
those passes because you cannot be reasonably certain about how a
modern hard disk stores data on the platter. If the encoding is
unknown, then writing random patterns is your best strategy.
In particular, Gutmann says that "in the time since this paper was
published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique
described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil
spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding
techniques. As a result, they advocate applying the voodoo to PRML and
EPRML drives even though it will have no more effect than a simple
scrubbing with random data... For any modern PRML/EPRML drive, a few
passes of random scrubbing is the best you can do".
Read these papers by Peter Gutmann: Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory
Data Remanence in Semiconductor Devices
[end quote]
If you read these papers are others, I think you'll agree that most any
magnetically-stored data is retrievable (even if wiped and/or rewritten
with newer data). It largely depends on how much money one is willing
to spend, the types of resources available, and available time. A local
police department won't have the funds/resources/time to retrieve data
from a well-wiped drive, but large government agencies, if sufficiently
motivated (e.g., to decipher terrorist plans), certainly will.

I am the FoxyProxy Firefox extension author.
At  Scott Squires & Mike Perry write:
"[...] So far the author has expressed no interest in implementing [proxy-per-tab] ability."
This statement is patently false. I have repeatedly gone on record as saying "proxy-per-tab" is a
goal of FoxyProxy. I've made this at irc.mozilla.org ( and various other channels), the
FoxyProxy forums ( and even show it as a goal for version
2.8 at the FoxyProxy proxy road map at I would have added this feature a very long time ago if I knew *how* to do it. Unfortunately, it's
unlikely to happen even for 2.8 (as shown in the road map) because I'm no closer to getting it to
work than I was a year ago... even after much research.
If you have any pointers on how to achieve proxy-per-tab, I'd be grateful to hear them. I've asked
in mozilla.dev.extensions, mozilla.dev.tech.network, IRC, as well as some prominent Firefox and
SeaMonkey developers (Christian Biesinger, Benjamin Smedberg, Philip Chee, Michael Vincent Van
Rantwijk, etc.) Christian Biesinger and Michael Vincent Van Rantwijk had some ideas which
eventually panned out.
One of the problems with FoxyProxy as it relates to Tor have been documented here for a very long
time (linked prominently from the front FoxyProxy web page):
Note that FoxyProxy has a broader audience than people wishing pure anonymity and so this problem
is not an issue for all FoxyProxy users.
At the least, I'd appreciate if Scott and Mike change the torbutton webpage. Moreover, I welcome
you to contribute to FoxyProxy and/or help me solve the proxy-per-tab difficulties.

Thank you!
Yes. Mapping nsIURI instances to tabs (when applicable) is the heart of the problem.
I've had a look through this. Thank you very kindly. This seems to tabs to windows.
Excellent idea, and one that I haven't yet tried. I have some questions about cssblocker.js, but
maybe it's better to take them off-list?
In theory this would work, but I'm hesitant to change that part of FoxyProxy right now ("patterns"
mode) since it works very well. The nsURI to tabbrowser mapping would best be used in a new
FoxyProxy mode ("proxy-per-tab"). The user may choose to keep some tabs/browsers in patterns mode
and others in proxy-per-tab mode, in which case both of these algorithms would be in use.
It's not clear to me what you're getting at here. Once I have a tab associated to an nsURI
instance, isn't that enough to select the correct proxy?
Thank you. I also hope we can work together, too.
Looking forward to the document, and thanks for the invitation to borrow. Should we take this
