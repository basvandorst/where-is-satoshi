hi, i am principle developer of Rodi project.
i read your post on the
Tor maillist. i thought that probably you could check this project Rodi is an open source project. i am desperately looking for one-two servers
to run simple PHP scripts or a couple of rodi clients (Java code) on different
ports. Rodi application contains two separate parts - rodi engine (CLI)
and GUI front end. Interface between two is socket based and secured. Rodi
engine never runs above 1% and requires about 25M of RAM. Size of the binary
is about 350K. Memory footprint can be made smaller by removing debug information
if you need.
greatly appreciate your help, Arkady
