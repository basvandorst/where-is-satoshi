Hi There,
Sorry - not trying to be too critical here, but them sounds like weasel words - 'mostly taken' and 'can be'. Without having *all* source verified by cryptographic signatures or otherwise, you're probably increasing the chances of rogue code running, rather than mitigating it with binaries.
Reviews take too long - by the time a 'negative' review is out - it's too late, there will be systems that are running compromised code.
My first suggestion - all source / binaries being cryptographically

Yes, if those services are vulnerable whether they're running as a Tor service or not.
The other concern is that hidden services expose information about the system that the hidden service is running on, i.e. a http server that lists the operating system that it's running on, or a daemon that shows the location that the hidden service is running on.

I guess the question I have for you is "What's the benefit of turning every Tor client into a hidden service?".
To quote the hidden service FAQ , " If your computer isn't online all the time, your hidden service won't be either. This leaks information to an observant adversary.", so yes.
I guess this doesn't even cover the ethical (?) question of whether it's ethical to turn client machines into hidden services by default, without asking the user.

Or they could just revoke your developer certificate, and cause a lot of
grief for the users of tor that has been signed with your certificate,
as it will no longer run. This also probably wouldn't give tor a
terribly good reputation either for reliability..

Are they mutually exclusive?
With that attitude, you may as well propose that those who use Tor under
repressive regimes should 'get their priorities straight' and just up
and move to a different country - oh, and that the Windows port should
be dropped as well.

To what point will this be? I'd say the majority of SMTP w/ TLS servers are using self-signed certificates. It's arguable whether TLS with a self signed certificate is any better than just plaintext.

There's an interesting question on Quora about Tor at the moment - "Tor:
Why did the US government create and continue to fund Tor?", which can
be found at
So far, there are 4 answers including.. ..
"Bram Cohen, Inventor of BitTorrent -
Many other countries have countrywide firewalls to limit what their
citizens/residents can see of the internet. The US State Department
views this as a bad thing and proactively promotes Tor because it's the
tool of choice for freely browsing the internet from behind such a
firewall, which appears to be the main use which Tor is put to."
"Brendan Guinn, IT Engineer, History Buff, Fumbling Guitarist
The same reason they created it--Tor allows essentially anonymous web
traffic, and if for no other purpose than insidious action against a
national enemy--but ranging from the original intended purpose of
protecting international & domestic agents*, to the actual state of
unhindered civilian usage of the system--any government would have a few
compelling reasons to fund a system which performs the function Tor does.
However, it's worth noting that the idea of onion routing--encrypting
traffic and randomly bouncing it from node to node, encrypting further
and decrypting from node to node as well, adding another layer (Geddit?)
to security--is a DARPA-funded, U.S. Navy development*. Of course
they're still funding it--it's their brainchild.

EV certificates don't fix any problem. The validation of a 'legal
entity' is purely due to an agreed policy. A rogue, compromised, or
alternate CA could release certificates with EV fields that don't
'rigorously' validate the organisation that applies for the certificate.
Which contradicts with the point of hidden services in the first place,
that neither party knows the others identity [1].

This is a real success story for Tor, hopefully abating some of the negative publicity surrounding the use of Tor.
(from 1 Million People use Facebook over Tor
People who choose to communicate over Tor do so for a variety of reasons related to privacy, security and safety. As we've written previously it's important to us to provide methods for people to use our services securely ? particularly if they lack reliable methods to do so.
This is why in the last two years we built the Facebook onion site and onion-mobile site, helped standardise the ?.onion? domain name, and implemented Tor connectivity for our Android mobile app by enabling connections through Orbot.
Over this period the number of people who access Facebook over Tor has increased. In June 2015, over a typical 30 day period, about 525,000 people would access Facebook over Tor e.g.: by using Tor Browser to access  or the Facebook Onion site, or by using Orbot on Android. This number has grown ? roughly linearly ? and this month, for the first time, we saw this ?30 day? figure exceed 1 million people.
This growth is a reflection of the choices that people make to use Facebook over Tor, and the value that it provides them. We hope they will continue to provide feedback and help us keep improving.
