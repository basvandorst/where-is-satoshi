No, it is not just you.  I am getting the same error.  MacOSX v. 10.4  has the following permissions on /tmp:
sarah:~ peter$ ls -ld /tmp
lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin  11 May 13 19:47 /tmp -> private/tmp
sarah:~ peter$ ls -ld /private/tmp
drwxrwxrwt   6 root  wheel  204 May 22 10:01 /private/tmp
The final "t" is the "sticky bit."  From the MacOSX 10.4 man pages:
"A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only  directory, or, more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of  files is restricted.  A file in a sticky directory may only be  removed or renamed by a user if the user has write permission for the  directory and the user is the owner of the file, the owner of the  directory, or the super-user.  This feature is usefully applied to  directories such as /tmp which must be publicly writable but should  deny users the license to arbitrarily delete or rename each others'  So fink should be able to write to /tmp, but I am getting the same  error message.
Thanks Alexander.  So now that I have enabled CVS updating, will the  process work OK now?
