When I compile new versions of stable or alpha Tor, should I ensure I
have the latest version of libevent, or use the current, always
outdated, version of libevent from my Linux distro's repo? Are there
any disadvantages to not using the latest libevent from the official
libevent homepage?

I can't find an answer to this question anywhere.
In using Konqueror with Tor and Privoxy, should the SOCKS settings in
Konqueror's Settings->Configure Konqueror->Proxy->SOCKS be configured
in some way? It seems to work fine without the SOCKS section
configured, but leaving the "Enable SOCKS support" box unchecked
disturbs me slightly. Should this section need configuration if
everything appears to be working? Why are instructions for Firefox for
SOCKS always specified but when it comes to Konqueror, no one says
anything about the SOCKS configuration area?

Hi Roger, thank you.
I'm using libevent 1.3b-0 with the latest stable version of Tor, and
without going further into platform details, I would venture to guess
it's probably fine according to your response, I've seen no errors but
in compiling for myself I've grown accustomed to always having the
most recent versions of dependencies, but haven't seen anyone else in
their compiling notes mention using the latest version of libevent.
When looking at some of the recent updates in changelogs for libevent,
I was concerned not having the latest version would be an issue
somewhere, even if errors didn't crop up, as some of the updates in
more recent versions than mine look especially important.
Thanks for all you do!

Hi Roger,
Thanks for the link & info. I've visited dozens of the pages with
information on how to setup SOCKS in Firefox on Windows and Linux, but
nothing on Konqueror settings, as they differ in the SOCKS setting. In
the SOCKS configuration area within Konqueror, it looks like this:
[ ] Enable SOCKS Support
SOCKS Implementation
[ ] Auto detect [ ] NEC SOCKS [ ] Dante
[ ] Use custom library
Path: ____________________
Additional Library Search Paths (section with Path and fields)
Add / Remove / Test buttons
I'm not sure what to enter on this page should I enable SOCKS support
here. Enabling with the Auto detect item selected doesn't work, should
I enable the Use custom library option, what would the path be,
please? If this matter could be solved it would add to the official
FAQ some valuable information I've not found elsewhere.
I would guess it's rather uncommon for people to use Konqueror with Tor+Privoxy?
