Linus says he can do it in 2 tries :-)
All (four) IPv6 bridges assigned to the email distributor, and
assignments are persistent.
Linus suggests re-adding the static footer on
 at least until we have a lot more IPv6
I think that's pretty reasonable. I will also add my 2 IPv6 bridges to
the footer as well.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Verifying node operator identity (was: New paper : 
Security based on trusting the exit operators won't work; even the most
honorable operators are subject to upstream taps or could have their exits
broken into and backdoored. Disincentivsing people from helping the Tor
network by suggesting that in order to help you have to give up personal
privacy seems more likely to hurt than help.
A different approach would be figuring out how to increase the diversity
and numbers of fast exits, perhaps by strengthening protections for running
exits in countries where that isn't the case, and educating lawmakers and
enforcers so that perhaps some day our advice won't be "Don't run an exit
at home" [1] but look more like that of the Open Wireless project [2].
