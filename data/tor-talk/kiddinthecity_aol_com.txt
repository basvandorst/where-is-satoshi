This was an interesting discussion.
I was just thinking of starting a thread on why people use the
appellative 'dark' as for 'dark net'. I found it quite disturbing and
offensive, also in a racialised way.
For example I have recently had this argument on Twitter with the
author of this journal article:
Gehl, Robert W. 2014. ?Power/freedom on the Dark Web: A Digital
Ethnography of the Dark Web Social Network.? New Media & Society,
October, 1461444814554900. doi:10.1177/1461444814554900.
His reply was that 'dark' only means 'out of light', where 'light' is
obviously monitoring Google & co.
I strongly disagree and I suggest to drop 'dark' from TOR services.
Funny enough, only the day after the chief of London MET declared:
'internet has become a ?dark and ungoverned? space populated by
paedophiles, murderers and terrorists'. This also can be seen with a
shade of racism.
The full report of this is here:
(sorry for the ranting)

Katia, thanks very much for pointing to the discussion, which is simply
fascinating. I will read it more attentively.
Let me say that meanings are never fixed or 'stuck' and that the
struggle to shift them is always open. So between cosmic space,
night/day, hidden/open, there are plenty of shades and personalities
coming out.
I think the use of 'dark' is not neutral and it hides a moral geography
of the Net, which might appeal to some of the 'insiders' too. I also
think that the anti-terrorism, anti-immigrants, anti-whatever symbols
(all 'dark' of course) are serious attacks to Internet freedom too.
That's my 2 penny thought.

'Negro' was an accepted term till the Civil Rights Movement made it
queer, now no media outlet can use it any more. You are right that it
takes time, but this is not impossible.
A practical action I suggest is to start from the wiki on the Tor
blog/site. Something along the line: 'onion space/web/whatever' (what
media normally call 'darkweb') or a more clearer statement such: 'we do
not condone the use of 'darkweb' because...'
The battle on the name 'hacker' is also open, in my view. see for
instance this paper:
Alleyne, Brian. 2011. ?We are all hackers now?:
critical sociological reflections on the hacking phenomenon.

Hi Mirimir
Thanks for finding my public key, I was about to post it. I think that
is because aol interprets both domain as the same .com!
I will get there soon :D

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Reminder] Social research on uses of TOR in Turkey 
Thanks to those who replied to my previous appeal for help.
I am Uni of London researcher (Sociology - Goldsmiths, my website below
the signature) conducting a study of people's responses to Internet
censorship in Turkey during and after Twitter block in March 2014.
If you have a direct experience, a story, or some advice of how to
snow-ball this request please get in touch via PGP standard (my public
key is on default key server).
I am mostly interested in people's experience of using or helping others
using TOR as a means for circumventing censorship. How easy/difficult
ordinary users (that is, not experienced hackers) find it? Will they use
it again? What did they learn from this?
Many thanks again to those who already replied, I will share my article
on here when ready (before it gets sucked up by publishing copyright
Great stuff, the Source be with you!

Hi and sorry for the late reply.
Grace H., this is my key fingerprint:

I am new to encryption but I've read that this is the most secure way of
starting sharing keys, and not sharing key id 0x...
see here, Jacob from EFF suggestions:
Now, I still accepting responses on the research call on Turkish
practices, experiences, stories of circumvention of twitter censorship
in/post March 2014 (esp TOR).
Many thanks

Dear All
I just finished and re-submitted my research paper on Turkish censorship in March 2014. I would like to thank all list members that have contributed, directly and off-list, in plain or encrypted text.
You can download the final version here (please give feedback):
*?Cultural Practices of the Hacking Multitude?, journal article, /Big Data & Society/, SAGE.*
I take a chance to also flag out this article of mine that has just been published in Visual Studies on CCTV hacking in London (also available as final/published version on the same webpage):
*?Sniffing the City: Issues of sousveillance in innercity London?, journal article, /Visual Studies/ 29.3 , This is my modest contribution to Open Access Week (although all my stuff is under CC anyway).
