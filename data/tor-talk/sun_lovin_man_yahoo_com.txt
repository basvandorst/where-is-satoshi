@_subject: Gentoo's response on them blocking access to their forums via Tor 
I'm far from being a TOR expert...(rather, I'm quite
the novice...)
But, I see no way for a website operator to ban folks
using TOR from posting, but allow browsing...
As the website operator faced with anonymous
antagonizers...Would you force posters to authenticate
from a particular IP address(an unworkable solution,
if you want increased participation...)?  Or are you
suggesting that Gentoo implement only user bans
instead of IP bans?
Or is there another solution?
Just trying to learn here...

Just out of curiousity, how does being only an exit
server help this?
Is it because exit things are plain text and middleman
things are encrypted?
I am fairly certain it has nothing to do with the
ports used, right?  Because, unless I misunderstand
the TOR system (which is indeed quite likely) TOR
servers who are middleman are requested to keep open
all exit ports, to be able to contact other TOR
servers on those ports...

I may be missing something, but the response template
appears to be directed to an ISP, not a copyright
owner.  But, I read the letter as coming from a
copyright owner.  Thus, the template would not be
