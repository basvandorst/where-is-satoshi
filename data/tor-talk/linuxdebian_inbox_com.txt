IMO, only stupid idiot doesn't use https with gmail.
That's why I think all talkings about gmail and beeing hacked is useless.
Let him set "Use always https" in the gmail settings, then log out, log in, change password and secure q/answer and that's all.
This should be about Tor and Tor close stuff...

Hello Mr. Eugen,
  I do recommend you one cool hosting provider - His offer is very comfortable, good prices and if your offer on the page doesn't suit you exactly, you can settle more details individually. They're open to do the best for their customers.
Really, give it a try. They're reliable, can speak English.
As I can see now, their pages are not in English. Use google translator (translate.google.com) if needed and/or contact them directly, contacts are on the page as well.
  Turn to EUR prices in upper right corner on their page. The prices is 'IMHO' very nice ;-)
Hope, you will like it.
Goodluck !
