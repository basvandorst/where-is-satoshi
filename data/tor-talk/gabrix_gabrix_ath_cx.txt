It's a little time i 'm running a website.
It's still under development so most of the insides are still provvisory but the general idea is to concentrate on freesoftware,privacy,anonymity,underground networks ecc.
I will start advertise carciofo on my website so let me know of any news and i would like a sort of forum or chat where i can post questions about tor and family ....
I'm implementing a tor middle node and i would like also netsukuku but i get errors in the ./configure i hope you answer , ciao !

@_subject: Tor & dynamic dns 
On the gateway machine where tor is set as a middle exit policy i have to manually set the ipaddress cause the pubblic interface eth0 is connected to a router (2 gateways for my lan) .Tor doesn't manage to resolve gabrix.ath.cx which is my FQDN.
Apparently Linuxbox eth0 should have the pubblic ip my lan is so configured:
[router netgear]---[linuxboxTOR]---[switch]---[serverWWW]-[serverMAIL]

I invite everyone , who is trying , tryed or is actually applying a
chain of proxies for browsing,like manies  one after the other  , or unusual  proxies configurations  for anonymous browsing different from
the usual tor/privoxy duo,socat,anonweb,polipo,squid,wwwoffle, to let me

@_subject: tor privoxy squid 
I have installed squid on the gateway machine together with privoxy-tor .Squid is configured to have privoxy-tor as parent proxy. Iptables is set to redirect port 80 traffic to squid's port 3128 .I have tor-privoxy on each lan machine and browsers' torbutton , too.when i start a browser connections from a lan machine browsers are configured with the local privoxy-tor and with tcpdump on the gateway machine , http traffic doesn't seem to go to port 80 where iptables is supposed to redirect packets to squid 3128.
If i click on a port 80 url , because tor , traffic goes to tor network , let's say 9001 but it differs from time to time.How can i catch with iptables tor traffic coming from my lan?By port we sayd too generic, i tryied by --uid-owner debian-tor but it doesn' seem to work,neither!
Thank you !!!
My lan machines are debian sarge stable kernel 2.6 , my gateway machine is a debian etch 2.6,too.

Since i moved the tor server browsing and others is fine in my network.Shame cause i'm a tor sustainer but the cosume of bandwith is too high(and also adsl bill) and is proportional to the amount of bandwith someone has.I don't use tor as server and client.I have a tor aon each machine in my network and the one on the gateway machine is doing the server and just that i'm really sorry for me too but i can't sustain that.I think tor developpers should repair that.

I don't know personally much people using linux and between the people i know i'm the skillest ... i'm too lazy for reading but i do it anyway offcourse and i think i can learn more asking experiences around that , usually , are not written anywhere . I have to admit i know linux my way which is not always the proper , people experience is important .
I like proxy servers and all their forms and i'm also curious on tools like sockat for example and i can read all manuals i want but only seeing someone using it i can learn the proper way to look at  ... it's just the way i am.

Uahu !I already had this but i love collaboration and thanks!contact me at skype gabx666 or visit the website i'm building at  ,please keep in touch ok ?
What i'm trying to is:
I have tor+privoxy on each lan machine behind the gateway , now , i want lan http requests to go first locally "torbuttoned" and than ,before togo in internet,beeing proxied again by the gateway squid-tor-privoxy ... am i crazy ?It's fun!
I have this iptables:
Http requests once they leave my lan machines they don't go to port 80 but a tor-socks port so i was trying to get them to go through my squid gateway port one way ( --uid-owner ) or the other.

I corrected the iptables , i'm not using torbuttoned clients so direct to port , squid has default configuration, "just" added 'cache_peer      localhost       parent  8118    7       no-query default'  and 'never_direct allow all'.
http_access allow all ... as start !

and added this in my /etc/tor/torrc
The minimum possible , isn't?
I'm actually trying this guide
And i'm going to wait for a minimal iptables script that is going to
deal with this problem .Yes you got it! i'm waiting this script from you

and you saw my previous posts i tryied it.Sorry guys i hope you

An another question is :if  i announce port 110  and redirect traffic to 9090 which port shall i consider as priority in the above iptables  ?
Silly question isn't ?

@_subject: tor bandwith ratio 
As also the /etc/tor/torrc file says you can advertise a privileged port , clients see you listening on that port but in facts binding to an unprivileged one and  the syn packet get redirected by iptables to it.What confused me was an iptables i gave at the end of all rules ,a catch all ulog jump and i saw 'some' syn packets hitting the advertising port passing through all chains and not being redirected to the port where tor was really binding and than get dropped by my iptables,so in some way , some times,also the advertised port get involved ?Anyway this is a script i googled around that i modified it and using it.It's just from a little i'm into the 'mangle'  ,looks like  it works i will update you soon and wait eventual corrections some parts are a bit obscures to me ....

I want to be honest : i hate privoxy and his content filtering. i have
commented user.action file and default-action but navigation stops
anyway very often .I'm an adult person so babes or porno are allright
for me  . I don't need content filtering but fast browsing instead.I
never understood why squid never gets  on playing  unless in
congiunction with privoxy.Squid is the  father of anonymous proxism.it
makes top http header cleaning , powerfull caching and this is what
makes browsing fast,also in a way it makes content/website cleaning too
but around i have not found one guide saying how i can make tor , squid
parent.Well i know tor is not a http proxy and here it is my question:
How can i configure squid to work with tor without privoxy ????
Do i need socat?
How does socat work in this scenario ???
Thanks !

I had run an exit node as middle-man for about 5 mounthes and i never
got into any kind of legal troubble apart that normal operations like
browsing were impossible even bandwidth limiting
BandwidthRate 20KB and BandwidthBurst 20KBthe minimum possible.I hope
with new versions of tor , bandwidth limiting improved because when i
used it, it didn't seem much to work .My isp says i have a 2MB
connection in download but it never goes up 500KB-700KB most of the
time.I was really disappointed to stop my middle-man but i had to .Let
me know how you find bandwidth limiting  once you start because you
better start and try yourself , hasta siempre !!!
