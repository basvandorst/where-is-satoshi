Hello Nick Mathewson,
Thank you very much for letting me know about this upcoming change.
I will get TorStatus to work with this new version, and release an

Hello everybody,

I am wondering whether there have been any talks of running a DNS
system (outside of Tor) that would convert something like .hidden TLDs
into .onion.  This would allow server administrators to pick domains
that make sense, and would allow publishing things as hidden services
to become more broadly used.
It would not have to run inside of Tor, but would have to be
accessible to Tor.  I think most of the current tools for DNS (BIND
and such) would work relatively well, and might require only a few
hacks (we could even have everything just be CNAMEs instead of A
Am I missing something big?  I think this would make running hidden
services much easier if Tor gets larger -- and they will be much more
enticing to use for the Tor users.

@_author: Kasimir Gabert 
@_subject: Talks of hidden services and DNS 
This definitely sounds like it will work, and I cannot see it really
taking any extra or special coding.  I think it would work "out of the
box".  The DNS would work both in and out of Tor.  It would be running
outside of Tor, so users not using Tor would get back the CNAME
pointing to 1234abcd.onion and realize that they need Tor to use
.hidden. domains (or .hidden.int.).  It really seems to me like it
should all work well and integrate smoothly into the current system.
Then again, I am very new to Tor, so I could be overseeing something.
I do not see any major security holes that this would bring up.  It
seems to me like it would be the same as accessing google.com through
Tor -- the DNS is looked up through Tor and so it would not be
overridden by a malicious ISP or country.

@_subject: Talks of hidden services and DNS 
Hello HD,
I think that the only way it would work would be a first come, first
serve basis.  I do not think that authentication would be required,
although we could limit the amount of domains per onion address so
that we do not have one user taking up 500,000 domains or something.
The registrar could also run a program to make sure that there
actually is a website (or server) running at the hidden onion address.
 I think this way it would be too much hassle without any gain for
someone to destroy the DNS network.
The way that I see it would be all of the current hidden servers would
quickly get a name that they choose, and then as new servers come on
names should be readily available.
This all depends on how .onion addresses are assigned.  For example,
could one server have more than one .onion address?  Could it have
And also, should the registrar servers drop .hidden.int. or .hidden.
domains after a week or so of not being able to contact the .onion.?

It would be good if I could read, I am sorry for posting that I saw
the license as free.  Reading through it fully, it definitely is not.
The terms of the license are way too broad.  Trying to exclude malware
and spyware by licensing the program under a license which states that
it cannot be used to anything that restricts the rights of the user
will not work.  First of all, malware does not restrict the rights of
the user.  Second of all, malware doesn't care about licenses, and the
creators of much of the spyware and malware are not known to the
world, so even if they break this license nothing will happen to them.
Another thing that doesn't really make sense to me about the license
is that it restricts the right to modify the program if it uses a
commercial "connectivity service".  I am not a lawyer, but isn't my
ISP a commercial "connectivity service"?  It seems to me that this
program cannot be redistributed at all, because it can only be used
with a commercial "connectivity service", and therefore any
modification will break the license.

Hello Arrakis,
I believe that JT was saying that there are binary options regarding
whether you are properly using TOR, or not properly using TOR.  You
are arguing that TOR itself is not considered "Security".  He is
saying that people who have deemed TOR to be secure and anonymous can
either be using TOR properly or could have scripting, or other similar
things enabled, and thus compromising what they have deemed as secure.
And there is a *huge* difference between disabling all scripting and
using Lynx.  Lynx has no scripts, but also no images, not frames, no
color choices, and a very small screen size.  You can browse just as
"securely" with a properly configured Mozilla client as you can with
Lynx.  The security does not come from not downloading pictures, which
is the main distinguishing factor when compared with Lynx, it comes
from disabling scripting.
Just my two cents,

Another issue here is that surrendering the logs will actually have

The Overnet idea seems a tad silly.  If connections in between servers
need to be logged, I do not think the requirement of logging would
change were the connections to be for the Overnet or for the Internet.
And I honestly do not see a problem with engaging in illegal
activities to ensure the anonymity of Tor users.  What the government
is doing is illegal by any decent rational standards, and it will
[hopefully] never come to the level of abuse against us that Ghandi
and other active peaceful resistors were subjected to in order to
achieve their ends, so it is unlikely that standing on the sidelines
and shouting that more people need to join Tor will accomplish much.

You are definitely correct, I apologize.  Only when data is retained
across the world will hidden services not continue to provide the
anonymity that is currently provided... assuming of course that the
Tor servers are not all German.  It would be easily possible for the
government if the hidden server is German to track the connection from
a German user to it, however (after this law).
That is true, and we all do have until 20090101 to produce a solution.
 It would be bad, however, to lose anonymity for Germans for even a
few days after that date, especially because Germans, as a whole, seem
to be requiring it more and more lately.

A potential solution to this problem, which was brought up by another

You might be interested in reading With multiple problems existing, any that can be dealt with should be
dealt with.  There are large groups of Tor users in Germany who are
frustrated with these horrendous laws, and that means that it will be
much easier to deal with escaping data retention laws in Germany than
dealing with the numerous issues which you are presenting about ORs in
China.  This does not mean that they should not be dealt with, it just
means that when there is a movement to fix a certain problem it might
hurt rather than helps to claim that a similar but not necessarily
worse problem should be dealt with first.

giving myself two weeks at the end of this semester to get a new
interface that was designed for me implemented, redo the PHP frontend
code base, and push out a new version. :)
You can get the "actual" bandwidth code already, however.  I used a
moving average to calculate it.

Hello again,
I believe you're bandwidth is being calculated to be 14523 KB/s -- impressive!

(sorry for the top posting, I do not believe my phone can bottom post.)
Slightly OT but in response to the US ISP comment:
Until recently (my motherboard gave out) the ISP Xmission was great about my
server and dmca. I let them know about my tor node and the several dozen
takedowns I received afterwards were ignored by them---not to mention
everyone I have interacted with there has been very friendly and
knowledgeable (and my residental speed was $60/month for 50 Mbps full duplex
with fiber!) :)
I figure there are still a few small ISPs out there which haven't had the
chilling effect take hold.

In my opinion, more often then not DMCA takedown requests center around
file-sharing and also more often then not the takedown requests actually
have validity to them.
There are certainly instances where takedown requests are incorrect but
the frequency of them isn't high (again, my opinion).
My $0.02, after having processed many a takedown request.
If you want to exclude p2p, then I would bet that the amount of abuse
reports would plummet.

TorStatus is still in the SVN repository.  You can find the latest
release with SVN at
If you download this (or the trunk version), then you should be able
to follow the INSTALL file to setup a TorStatus page.
Let me know if you have any problems!

Hi Joe,
The US government is a very large group of individuals which extends
beyond the DoD / CIA / etc borders that I believe you may only be
considering.  For example, consider the NSF.  The NSF is a US
government agency that will fund large amounts of research which have
nearly or entirely no return to the US government directly[1]. I'm
very certain that many of the NSF projects can in fact be used by
anyone---the resulting research is published
internationally---regardless as to whether they are working in the US
government's classified world or whether they are working for US
Tor is funded in part by the NSF[2], but obviously not extensively.
The NSF is just a counter example to your claim.
I'm only discussing your use of the word ``[US] government'', but the
same idea will apply to nearly every relatively large subtree within
the US government.  Of course, if Tor was only funded from one
subtree, say the imaginary "US Monitoring Internet Communications
Agency" then you might have some reason to be concerned.
Take care,
[1] [2]
