@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Public Bridge Email 
When requesting bridge addresses via the email system, it only accepts
emails from gmail.com, yahoo.com, and mit.edu.
What's the process for adding domains to this list (or is there one)?
I'd love to see `gatech.edu` added. We have a large number of
international students, and many of them are from countries that
disallow access to US media networks. Having an easy way to get bridge
relays might be a plus for those students.

Looks like about 80% of bridge relays are blocked from China these
days (via the March 2012 progress report:
"We developed a tool for scans of bridge lists which attempts to
    either open a simple TCP connection to the bridge???s OR port or that
    will perform a full Tor handshake to the bridge. We tested the
    scanner by running a scan from Germany,
    and comparing results to bridge reachability information obtained
    from the bridge authority in The Netherlands. We also performed a
    scan from China,
    ,
    and found that over 80% of bridges were unreachable. We compared
    active scan results to passive usage statistics,
    ,
    and confirmed that bridges that were found as unreachable in the
    scan also reported significantly fewer connections from China than
    other bridges."
If you can't make a TCP connection to your bridge addresses, you may
need to just keep requesting more until it works.

Thanks for the tip; I've submitted a ticket (and CCed you on it).
The ticket is number 5655, and can be found here:

@_subject: [tor-talk] how does Tor generate IP Address 
By default you are not an exit node (ie someone elses traffic exits
from your machine and appears to come from you), or even a non-exit
relay. Tor will only pass other peoples traffic through your machine
if you configure it to.

Hash: SHA512
I actually already do this on my home network. Instead of a landing
page?which is always annoying and will cause the network to be
unusable by devices without a web-browser?I use a second
virtual-network for tor. So when I connect via my normal network name
I'm on the plain-ol' internet, but when I connect to mynetwork-tor I'm
on the Tor network.
If you own a coffee-shop, hotel, small business, etc. this works well
because people will have to come to you to request the password at
which time you can make sure they understand the benefits and dangers
of routing traffic through Tor. If they don't seem to know what
they're doing, tell them to use the normal one (which can have a very
strict access-policy, white-list a few good websites, etc.), otherwise
tell them to use Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] blocked exit node IP because of spam 
Yes, they always have, and probably always will.
Tor is designed to keep people anonymous; this works for both the good
guys, and the bad. This isn't something the Tor Project needs to fix
except through continued marketing and education. I'd suggest emailing
the administrator of the forums you're having trouble with (and
possibly the IP blacklist site) and explain what Tor is, a bit about
how it works, and exactly why it's beneficial for them to whitelist
Tor exit nodes. Maybe you can convince them to change their minds.
Good luck.

No, your node will build a circuit consisting of nodes that are not
itself, and not in the same family as itself.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Multiple Tor instances 
That's true, but you could equally have each application connect to
the same tor instance and the remote observer still won't be able to
determine that both sets of traffic belong to the same person.
