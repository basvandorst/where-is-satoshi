Not seeing that on my tor server, did have some other odd messages though.

Just started up my Tor client today and saw this
repeating in my log. Why are there signing keys made
up of zeroes? Is this a serious error, or just a
printing issue? It has been happening once or twice
per minute since I started it up. Dec 30 19:38:49.286 [Notice] We're missing a

@_subject: setting the minimum number of routers used in the network 
Does anyone out there know whether there is a way within the torrc file to
specify the minimum number of nodes to route through?  I note that the
default appears to be 3 (as the number of nodes / relays used on the network
map show as 3).   Is there a benefit in using more than 3? Other than a drain on the network,
is there a downside to using more than 3?
