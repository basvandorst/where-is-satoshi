@_subject: [tor-talk] FBI cracked Tor security 
The FBI reportedly cracked Tor's security to crack a child porn case with over 100 arrests of Tor users. I don't know how the FBI did it, and that's a good type of case for which to do it, but, considering that legitimate users need to evade high-end intelligence agencies that may be as skilled as the FBI and less friendly, it's worth discussing how the FBI might have done it. The news story didn't say what specific exploit it used. I forgot the news citation.
But one clue might be that the FBI can read Bugzilla posts for whichever browser Tor uses (Firefox now) to catalogue security flaws various people have discovered and reported. Some reports and responses are confidential but hacking those Bugzillas may be a priority for a hundred or more foreign intelligence agencies, most of whom are probably more skilled at cracking than Mozilla (or whomever) is at defending. It's also possible that a security flaw for another browser might be something to test for whether Firefox has a similar flaw.

Law enforcement agencies exaggerate and lie publicly in order to mislead people, such as unidentified suspects or to weed out claimants to notorious crimes who didn't really do it (there are quite a few), but the recent news report appeared, as I recall, to be based on a court or other official document about the FBI's work, not a news interview. It was vague, but probably not exaggerated or false.
If it was an attack through a website that then led to an attack on Tor, that's still an attack on Tor, and thus serious.
We should not assume attack methods won't be shared. An agency may share with other government agencies that have equal or higher levels of secrecy and with international allies.
I assume a website can know what browser I'm using and that if Tor allowed me to change its ID string a deeper method for identifying my browser is available and unpreventable. Already, some websites deny some functionality (like payments) or block access altogether (they might deny it but when entering captchas 15 times fails with Tor but, I think, never more than twice with non-Tor then they're probably blocking).
On whether to tell users about security methods:
--- I read the warning on viewport size and therefore I don't adjust my viewport; otherwise, I would be.
--- Fairly advanced security advice should be offered by considering two major groups of users: Those who are doing legitimate work requiring anonymity and who are working with or for someone who needs them to stay anonymous. Those who are doing acceptable work and mainly are providing cover for the first group. The first group will likely be told to read this information, and it should be in the browser, so bandwidth need not be used to read it and set up accordingly. We don't want someone watching how a main-legitimate user interacts with a security website. The cover-providing users have less security concerns and, hopefully, are using Tor to hide their music preferences from their kid sisters/brothers, and they won't be deterred from use because of a link being somewhere. The Mars intelligence agency will learn about something called "country-and-western" music but the Martians probably won't blow their cover.
--- More general security discussions should not be posted in Tor, but should be posted on websites. The Tor Project can decide which websites it trusts and list them on the Project's website, which can be or is linked to from inside the Tor browser. It's easier to update a website than to update Tor itself, and websites may have to be updated quickly and often.
Users and developers of Tor are likely more security-conscious on average than average users/devs of Firefox or, especially, whatever Microsoft calls their browser these days. Tor users will tolerate more info on the subject, as long as those who are relatively careless are not much slowed from jumping ahead without reading, if they wish.

Speculation: If evidence of Tor usage is in a header visible with full headers (a Yahoo display option), perhaps Yahoo uses that to waylay the email into a spam folder. The evidence might simply be an IP address associated with Tor usage. Maybe Gmail doesn't do the same thing.

In U.S. Federal law, the statute is at 5 U.S.C. 552 (choose from 2 URLs:  or  Some corporations are under it but only if they happen to be government agencies, defined inclusively; in one case, a parking lot organization was ruled to be such an agency because of its funding. But, generally, private organizations, including most nonprofits, are outside of section 552's reach. Many states have comparable laws, but, likewise, they probably are limited to government information. On the other hand, some of what the original poster wants are filed with government agencies and may be available there under these statutes regardless of what the Tor Project wishes.

A request has to be by a "person", not necessarily a national or citizen of the U.S., as far as I see in the statute. This came up as an issue during the Reagan Presidency because the Cold War-era U.S.S.R. reportedly made FOIA requests and I think they resolved it by the U.S. Attorney General of that time announcing that any agency refusing any FOIA request would have its position defended, but that may not apply any more.
By the way, anyone copying either of my URLs above from a quoted part of an email should be sure to get the entire URL, not just the part that is linked, and edit out the quote-signifying "> " strings.

@_subject: [tor-talk] if browser remembers URLs visited before shutdown even 
This replies to a September 26 post with the same title.
Thank you; I was unaware of the division. No, in the past I was using Tor as if it is a browser, so I was using the browser it comes with. I did not try to use it with any other browser.
I did not know if Tor's browser uses Firefox's security architecture and I don't know about esr versions. You wrote, "[b]y design, Tor Browser doesn't save data to disk across sessions." Firefox isn't supposed to but a computer shutdown allows only limited time for apps to clean themselves up and so, even without a crash, FF data may be preserved through a power-down and power-up, and I confirmed that it is. If Tor not only defaults to data erasure ("design") but is not hampered by a time limit during shutdown so that the data is always gone when settings call for it to be gone, then that's an improvement over FF. Consider the risk that many apps may have to clean up extensively and that there won't be enough time during shutdown to complete the cleanup, so that Tor may still leave data persisting through the next power cycling.
It took some effort to find the bug in FF, it took some more effort to convince people at FF that data is persistently stored, and a FF derivative is being used in Tor, so I would not be surprised if no one reported the bug at Tor before my question last month. The discussion at FF was going on for years. So the open question for Tor is not whether it's unreported but whether Tor behaves differently, and you and I have narrowed it down to the difference between design and behavior at shutdown time and similar times. If you or someone else knows the answer to that question, please post accordingly.
If the shutdown or similar time limit forces persistence of data, then that's a security bug.
And the UI language should be precise. "Never Remember History" is not that, given the persistence issue and if persistence is not to be ended. The people Tor is intended for, spies et al., are not full-time geeks and they can't make their use of Tor too visible by asking questions in the wrong places. So the UI issue is more sensitive for targeted Tor users than for most FF users. It's okay (not great but okay) to require using options but then the UI "Never" should be reworded so Tor (or FF) users are not misled. But if Tor doesn't present that "Never" language then Tor may not have a UI issue. UI language should be judged as most users would understand it. When, years ago, Microsoft wanted to discourage uninstalling its browser from Windows platforms, one of its techniques was to force people trying to properly uninstall to go through a nearly incomprehensible UI; I was geeky at the time and I didn't know what a couple of messages meant. And at least I knew it was incomprehensible. "Never Remember History" is easily comprehensible but, in FF's case, as most people would understand it, is wrong. A derivative of FF is in Tor. Thus, I ask about Tor's UI.

One need not use Tails to use Tor (I used to sometimes use Tor and never used Tails), so, while Tails may be a good idea, the question remains for Tor and its security architecture when not using Tails.

I think of how people actually use a product, which is usually not with all recommendations applied. There's good reason for using Tor even with an ordinary OS and Tor Project supports use with Windows and MacOS as well as Linux and Android, with Linux not limited to Tails ( or Whonix. I use Linux. I want an OS that runs on my hard drive so I can set/modify it more easily and I'm not sure abouot using an OS within an OS for a rare purpose. Probably many users add Tor to their existing OS for some of the benefits of Tor.
Exactly why the focus here.
I guess we can call it a crash but it looks like a normal shutdown. Shutdown normally limits time available to an app for self-clean-up. So, data persists.
It'll be good enough to correct the UI so it reflects what the program does. So, if Tor on most OSes keeps data, the UI should not say Never Remember History. Maybe it should say Never Remember New History. That's what Firefox needs and apparently Tor has the same relevant architecture so probably that's what Tor needs, too.

I understand Tor is based on Firefox. I haven't had Tor recently, but that was my impression when I did use it. If it is and if you don't read all of the Firefox Bugzilla bugs implicating security, please look at  and consider weighing in as appropriate.
It's about the Never Remember History setting remembering old history, meaning URLs visited. Some of us think that undermines security while some people think remembering visited URLs even after a reboot is what it should do. As an alternative, I proposed amending the wording "Never Remember History" to reflect what the program does, maybe "Never Remember Future History (Keep Old History)", but even rewording seems to be in dispute. That's in discussion at  but that's years old and still hasn't been implemented. If I were to try to patch it myself, patching might take hours and there's substantial risk it would be rolled back by another programmer. This is a security leak.
If it could affect Tor, please consider participating or patching.
I Googled all your mailing lists and I don't see this issue.
Best wishes.

It's about Tor, but I'll explain as if Tor is based on Firefox by describing the Firefox problem. Suppose it's set to Remember History. I visit example.com. Firefox remembers the URL. So far, no problem. Then I change Remember History to Never Remember History. I have no idea that it's still remembering example.com. Someone inspecting my computer can see that I visited example.com when I think they can't see any history. That's a security leak.
One could argue why I'd let anyone inspect my computer. However, Never Remember History is offered for a reason, probably as protection against anyone inspecting my computer.
The URLs are definitely stored somewhere. I proved that. Which file it's in, I don't know. It's stored somewhere available after powering down and powering up, i.e., through a cold boot. I tried identifying the exact location but failed. But it's somewhere there. I tested without networking or a removable (flash) drive ( Therefore, it had to have been stored on my local hard drive.
The complaint for Firefox is years old. It still has not been solved for Firefox. Thus, unless Tor people monitor most unpatched Firefox complaints (and there are many and most of them are unimportant), Tor people could have missed this one. A wontfix or invalid for Firefox might not be a decision appropriate for Tor.
Users could easily miss it for years. The user interface says Never Remember History. The meaning is unambiguous. The problem is that the UI's meaning does not reflect the programming inside Firefox. Most users would never test the truth of any UI. They would trust the UI. Therefore, in this case, most users would be misled.
The title was about Tor, albeit inspired by Firefox's problem. Firefox is definitely storing the URLs. If Tor uses the same design insofar as relevant, then Tor is also storing the URLs.
Clear History is not the complaint's subject. As far as I know, Clear History works. However, Never Rememmber History implies that the history is being cleared just by selecting Never Remember History. If a user should apply another step, the UI should not make a sweeping overclaim or else it should explicitly tell the user to take that step.
