@_subject: [tor-talk] Giving Hidden Services some love 
Hash: SHA512
Beside the nagging effort: A good portion of this list will probably host
one service or another that's publicly available (Pastebin, a blog, etc.)
- if more people would use Hidden Services for their private stuff
(Ideally on a different server) that would help too.
After the CCC we used the motivation given by the operators of
to set up our own XMPP-server, _solely_ as a hidden service (No shameless
self-promoting here.). So if we can do it, probably (or even 'most
likely') everybody can.
Yeah, it might not be Wikipedia or Youtube. But even the small steps count.
