Why kick of bad exits?  If you identify an exit that is gathering data or
manipulating data, then simply take them out of rotation and feed them
false connections so that they stay on line and wast resources.  Otherwise
they will shut down and be back up the same day.
If you can lead them on for a while it will make all tor users safer.

I would love to see an analysis of a 128 bit AES encryption VS a 10 exoflop
computer. How long to crack it?  Anyone got the math on this?
Andreas, your absolutely right, However we can do some estimating.
Just keep in mind... garbage in, garbage out.. but  this is a pretty good
So the fastest super computers use general cpus and Nvidia k20s. This is
important to note because they scale in a linear fashion based on available
space.   Now we know that Oak ridge national labs has about an acre of
space, 43,560 Sq. Feet,  for its super computer, the Cray XK7 Named Titan.
Which runs at 17.59 Pentaflops.  (yes PENTAFLOPS)
According to a Cray press release Titan can scale up to 50 Pentaflops.
Now the new facility in Utah will have over 200,000 sq. feet dedicated to
its super computer.
So If we assume, the a linear relationship between Square footage and
computing power then we can calculate that Utah will have 4.59  time more
space then Oak Ridge, so they will have room for at least 80.73
Several articles have stated that the center is designed to house an
Exoflop computer.  Thats a fast computer. Thats 10 followed by 18 zeros. Or
1000 petaflops.
There is more.  Lets look at our growth rate.   4.5 years ago Roadrunner
was the first super computer to brake the pentaflop barrier. Today we have
titan at 17.59 pentaflops. So if we can assume a growth rate of 380% per
year.  And that the center will be up graded with each new version of GPU
from Nvidia and CPUs from Intel, We can assume that we will hit one Exoflop
in about three years or 2015.
The power production at the new facility supports these numbers.
So what does this mean?   Any article that suggest that brute forcing
present day encryption is not possible should be taken with a grain of
salt.  While the article may be correct today, come September 2012, Utah
goes on line and we will be stepping into a world that will lead to exaflop
computers and may challenges to our present day encryptions.
AES is safe for a longtime, but other encryptions should be of concern in
the coming years.    Don't forget about tracking and fingerprinting
possibilities with these massive systems.
I would love to see an analysis of a 128 bit AES encryption VS a 10 exoflop

The good news, no one is going to care about your stuff... unless your
making waves.   Then the only safe encryption is a non mathematical method,
such as a  library code run on a system that does not go on the net.

I saw a lecture a while back, I think it was given by Whitfield Diffie of
public/ private  key fame although it was quite a while ago... , The
speaker said that the gov was storing encrypted messages that have been
intercepted from critical sources in hopes that quantum computing will
allow them to crack the encryptions eventually.
Basically he said that with quantum computing all bets are off and every
cipher today will likely be cracked. Quantum computing will require new
kinds of ciphers and only those with Qcomputers will be able to decrypt the
So a new class of people / government will emerge.   One class will be able
to decrypt or crack all messages sent with encryption.  And the other class
of people, those without Qcomputers, will only be able to decrypt ciphers
that they can encrypt.     One class can only view messages they create,
the other class can see everything.
I am guessing that the cost of Qcomputer technology will keep these
machines out of the hands of Joe public for decades to come...?

I think it is important to distinguish between Brute forcing the complete
cipher in a true sense, or as you say using an
"interesting attack".   You are correct new methods will be found and  many
of those methods will use Brute force as a component on some of the
variables in the attack.  So gobs of computing power + clever attack
strategies, will reveal new methiods.
So lets look at this from another view.   How fast does a computer have to
be to fully bruit force a 64,128,256 key?  ZettaFlops?  YottaFlops?

build a  safe flash player.  However, first we should focus on creating a

work as well as the Adobie product.  They are slow, tend to hang and

On the basis of patterns can be easily identified despite Tor users
anonymity than expected. The have Aaron Johnson , Chris Wacek , Micah Sherr
and Paul Syverson studied in a scientific study . The authors have
investigated here the data that go into the Tor network and compared with
those who come out . Especially users of BitTorrent or IRC via gate can be
exposed quickly . The problems , however, are known and Tor team has
adequately in their FAQs out .
Provided that both the attacker can also monitor the incoming and outgoing
traffic of at least one or more gateway relays the data can be analyzed and
assigned on the basis of comparative patterns of a given IP address . It
was only a matter of time , write the authors of the study, at least six
months , a user with up to 80 - percent probability 'll identify . For
example, since few users abriefen BitTorrent over Tor and a few relays
opened the ports for BitTorrent , they also stayed open long , so
decreasing the duration of a clearly de-anonymization .
Quickly identified by larger attack surface
The deanonymisation will accelerate when either the attacker complete
control over a portion of the traffic would , for example through an
autonomous system (AS ), or even an Internet Exchange Point ( IXP ) . Then
the period of identification partly reducing by half. A scenario that
classify the scientists in the context of the current discussion of the
work of the intelligence services to be realistic.
Additional tools that speed up the traffic on Tor network , increase the
risk deanonymization also , such as Congestion -Aware Path Selection ,
identified in the bottle necks and data can be redirected accordingly. The
higher the number of guards used by users , the higher the probability to
catch a guard, which is overseen by an attacker .
The four authors of the study but also give hints on how the
de-anonymization may be at least delayed , for example by the number of
entry guards would be reduced . An increase in the decay time of a Guards
could prolong the time until a user is identified. The study indicates that
the Tor team this measure have been used in version 0.2.4.12 -alpha. In
addition, users could manually reduce the number of entry , exit and
exclude nodes. This would indeed sent at the expense of speed more packets
of different clients by individual nodes , but they are less likely to be
assigned .
Although the results of their study are very pessimistic, the authors write
. But yet Gate means confidentiality over the Internet for thousands of
users . They were optimistic that the Tor team could offer the service and
continue to improve .

Would be interesting if someone created an app to test for the problem and
then published which big websites are slow to upgrade.
that would certainly be good for consumers.

I have had people contact me while i was in a technical chat room and tell
me not only what site I went to but the name of a file I down loaded.

I should add, this was the regular web, not a hidden service site.

Congrats.  It sounds like a fantastic addition to increase security with
Tor severs. .
With that said,  The name is kinda misleading.  As a Ramdisk refers to a
very specific devise or software function.    Might want to consider adding
something to the name that implies secure server functionality.
Just my 2 cents.
Congrats again.

Great, so now ALL traffic from a user of this product will be on
TOR?  Amazon, Facebook, looking at cute cat videos....
Have they have they set aside a few dollars of profit  to host servers to
match bandwidth demand?
You see my point?  Right.  Tor should be used selectively.

I agree.  I guess my real issue is that a for-profit company's should share
the wealth and help build the TOR network via server sponsership in direct
porportion to the incrmental bandwidth thier custermers use.  This is in
there own self interest in fact.  If the network slows down, thier
customers experience will degrade.  It would also be nice to see them
support development by donations.  In addition, perhaps even offering
bounties for wish list items the core team does not have time for.  (there
is an existing list)
Now in the interest of more annonimity for tor users, I am off to watch cat

Transparency is key at all levels and on all topics.
​Without transparency, Tor will end.  It will be a slow degradation.
Tor will loose participants and funding slowly at all level and in all
Development will slow and eventually, it will fade.
And who benefits?  Not Tor users.
If you wanted to destroy Tor, this is a perfect way to do it.
Create a separate mailing list if you want but all topics should be
free and open for conversation.
Openness and transparency is the life blood of Tor, without it, the project
is dead.
Its just a matter of time.
