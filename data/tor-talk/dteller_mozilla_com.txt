As a side-note, there is a will to make FirefoxOS very safe, but as far
as I know, very few people work on this actively at the moment. If you
are interested in contributing to this effort, I can try and find you a
good interlocutor.

Actually, that's not true. Maybe you checked on B2G Desktop, which uses
a single process. On the real FirefoxOS, each app runs in its own
process, with the following exceptions:
- the browser UI (i.e. the url bar) is part of the system process;
- dialer, contacts and First Time use are three view of the same
Each process has a distinct uid.
Investigating the issue. I believe some work is needed here, but that
doesn't look too hard platform-wise.
What kind of leaks do you have in mind?
By default, that is correct. What would you suggest?
I know that the system can detect attempts to access the network by an
app, so I suspect that it wouldn't be too hard to fully deactivate
network access once the app is installed.

Actually, in my mind, that's one point against safety of Node.js
applications. Redefining, say, Array.prototype.forEach is a good way to
introduce hard-to-track bugs. Doubly so if this is done silently by
importing a package (almost sure the latter is possible, but I haven't
actually checked).

@_subject: [tor-talk] New API for TorBrowser add-on 
We (Mozilla) are in the process of overhauling the Session Restore
mechanism of Firefox. One of the next steps is to get rid of
"sessionstore-state-write", as it forces us to serialize the entire
state of Firefox on the main thread, which is quite bad for performance.
As far as I can tell, TorBrowser is the only add-on that makes use of
this observer notification. I'd like to discuss if we cannot provide you
with a better API that would let us kill sessionstore-state-write.

I probably don't have nearly enough time to work on this, but I'm
interested in following (and possibly co-mentoring) any project on Tor
for FirefoxOS.
It might be good fodder for a Mozilla Student Project, too

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor implementation in JavaScript / FirefoxOS 
Well, I'm not familiar with that binary port, so if it is a device
driver, there might be ways to install it on FirefoxOS, but the equation
FirefoxOS = Android is generally false. FirefoxOS is the Android *kernel
+ device drivers*, plus a completely different OS stack on top of it.
On the other hand, it might be possible to compile the native Tor to a
JavaScript library through Emscripten.
At the moment, I don't think there is anything such. It would probably
be relatively easy to add, since Gecko itself supports it. I can open a
bug, if there is interest.
Fwiw, each app is a browser process.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox, Adobe, and DRM 
Hi Paul,
 It's actually more complicated than this. Since pretty much everyone at
Mozilla hates DRM, we took the least evil option that did not involve
project suicide.
Adobe will implement a sandboxed proprietary black box plug-in for
decoding DRM-ed data. We will provide an API to make it work and the
ability for users to download the plug-in (very streamlined, most likely).
The DRM code will *not* be part of Firefox. While the internal API
hasn't been designed or implemented yet, I suspect that toggling a
preference will be sufficient to remove the streamlined mode for
downloading the plug-in. I am pretty sure most Firefox devs will toggle
off that preference ? I am certainly planning to.
Alternatively, TorBrowser should be able to use IceWeasel, the entirely
free fork of Firefox. This fork doesn't offer h.264 and will certainly
similarly deactivate the DRM-related code.
 David
P.S.: I haven't heard about money changing hands, although I wouldn't be
surprised if we had to pay Adobe for that. Whether you decide to believe
me is, of course, your choice.

Hi Gerardus,
  I don't really know, I am not involved in this project at all. Also, I
am not a believer in DRM ? no matter how sophisticated, I am pretty sure
that a graphics driver can easily defeat it, and if such drivers do not
exist yet, I am sure that they will. Perhaps it can also be defeated in
other layers, I have not investigated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Upcoming change to Firefox internals that hopefully 
Hi everyone,
 We are planning to land a change in Firefox that has a small chance of
impacting TBB. The patch is here:
 .
Now that Firefox handles internally the non-saving of private
tabs/windows, we believe that this should have no impact. It would be
great if someone working on TBB could confirm that we are not breaking

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and JavaScript 
Well, there are many ways to use JavaScript to deanonymize you.
For instance, JS can be used to measure the speed of specific operations
on your computer, which already gives some information on what kind of
computer you are using. Firefox contains some counter-measures against
this, TorBrowser contains even more, but nothing is 100% safe.
Depending on your processor, there are also known attacks that work
inside a process or across processes that can be triggered in JavaScript
and used to read some of your memory. Again, your OS has
counter-measures, Firefox has counter-measures, TorBrowser has
counter-measures, but nothing is 100% safe.
Finally, JS has access to a number of APIs that can accidentally be used
to identify you (e.g. there are ways to find out your list of fonts, and
list of fonts are typically different from a computer to the other one).
Usually, these holes are plugged in TorBrowser, but there may be holes
that have escaped the attention of devs.
I personally browse with JS activated, because I have very low safety
requirements (I use TorBrowser as a VPN, largely to increase deniability
by people who really need this), but YMMV.

I haven't noticed this border, but torBrowser does add random borders
to windows to make it harder to fingerprint you. So what you're
