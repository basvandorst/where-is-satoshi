@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia and Tor: Controlling when the identity changes 
I'm performing some latency measurements over the Tor network. To avoid congesting the relays, each run of my test lasts about 15 to 20 minutes maximum, consuming an average bandwidth of 2 kbps.
Because of the way the relay works, my measurements get disrupted because the identity automatically changes every few minutes. I wonder if someone knows how to do these:
Alternatively, disabling the automatic identity change and allowing me to use vidalia's control panel to change identities manually
ExitNodes to an ipaddress, and StrictNode to 1, but after an initial connection to that specific exit relay and 1 http connection to the outside world, no subsequent traffic is routed out of tor.
My setup consists of ubuntu 12.04 lts, installing vidalia and tor using apt-get and firefox connecting to tor using socks via localhost:9050
My last option is to look into the source code and find the appropriate code segments and recompile from sourcee, but being a tor novice I won't know where to begin.
