@_subject: Google Summer of Code 2009 
Hi Everybody,
I want to start by saying thank you. It is an honor to be selected for
Google Summer of Code on the Tor Project. I only hope that this project
can be the start of my larger commitment to Tor. You've all placed your
faith in me to complete the project before summer's end. With my mentor
Matt Edman's assistance I intend to do just that.
My name is Stephen Tyree and I'm a second year PhD student in Computer
Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My research interests deal
with general cryptography, secure information processing schemes and
information anonymity schemes. The project I will be working on requires
three tasks. The first task will be the creation of a plugin API for
Vidalia. The end goal of this would be increased modularity in the
Vidalia codebase as well as an expansion of the developer community. The
second task will be the creation of a Tor Browser Bundle plugin for Mac
OSX. The purpose of this plugin is fairly self-explanatory. The third
task will be the creation of a plugin for HerdictWeb. HerdictWeb
( is a web application designed to allow
easy reporting of website availability and thus censorship based on ones
location. The security of this reporting is increased when coupled with
the Tor network making a Vidalia plugin for this a natural fit.
If you have any questions or comments about the project you can find me
hanging around  under the guise "tyree731". I want to say thank you
again to everybody involved for selecting me for this year's Google
Summer of Code. Let's Hack! ;-)
