@_subject: [tor-talk] Relay Only? 
New to Tor...
I have an Intel 64-bit machine with Fedora Linux that's not currently doing anything and I want to set it up as a Tor relay. It won't be used for anything else -- no client use. Is there a Linux OS that is best for a Tor relay? (A server installation, perhaps?) Does it matter?
Is there a Tor "relay" download or must I install the client to be able to configure as a relay? (Calling it a "client" infers that there is a non-client version as well.)
Regular relay or bridge relay?
All advice appreciated.

Personally, I've only recently become interested in Tor and I was *happy* to see that its community uses a mailing list rather than a forum. To each his own. No need to remember yet another log-in, and each posting s sent directly to me. What could be more convenient?
I'm not sure where you're coming from. Why can't non-techies use email?!? How is this mailing list preventing a lot of people from communicating?
You're clearly frustrated about something, I'm not sure what and, despite the length of your tirade, you failed to explain why a mailing list is (in your opinion) "ivory tower" and beyond the capabilities of non-techies. Okay, we get it, you prefer forum software of some kind, but why? Why is email so terrible? Why is a forum superior for those you deem non technical?

Bug reports? Email bug reports? Tor bug reports? That there should be a forum I am not questioning. I'm just wanting clarification on what's wrong with email. You asserted, numerous times, that email sucks for this community but never explained why. I fail to understand how reading old bug reports would clarify this for me. Newbs to what, Tor? Why won't they use mailing lists? Personal preference, lack of skill or something else?
Why? Just trying to understand the "barrier" aspect. And TBB is....?
Are you saying that newbs don't *like* email, preferring forum-type interfaces instead? Is there research on this? Or do you have only anecdotal evidence? Personally, there is enough variation in the mechanisms and functioning of the various forums to which I subscribe that I vastly prefer the consistency of email, filtered right into mailboxes I can peruse without missing a thing. No need to "subscribe" to threads. It just works. But do explain how email is a barrier to newbs.

So, basically, you want to protect newbs from ever having to learn to use email. Do you not believe that email is a valuable tool? Is it, in your opinion, an outdated mechanism? If they learned to use email, would they not likely find it a handy tool?
Yet newbs routinely figure out the intricacies of FaceBook. A proper email client takes care of threading. No one is "making it hard". It is what it is; if they want help, learn how to get it. If you want to make it easier, then do it. I'm brand new to Tor and, IMO, the developers should be working on Tor, not on ways to save newbs from having to learn anything. Seems to me that if these folks want to use this free product, the least they can do is put in the effort to learn how. Now, if you want to make it easier to find help, by all means, do. I applaud your altruistic motivations. But I do not applaud your initial rant which seemed a bit like the spokesperson for the "Occupy Tor Street" crowd demanding that the one percent work harder to give the 99% better free stuff. I'll make this offer: you do the research and choose the forum software you want (that runs on a standard LAMP server) to use and I'll put it on line and make you the admin. Create the forum of your dreams and I'll foot the bill. Fair enough?
Let the Tor developers work on Tor.

I wouldn't. I'd ask on Tor-talk and have an answer in minutes. I've done a fair amount of searching on various fora. Often it is a matter of knowing what something is called in order to find it. Often, the feature I'm researching is called something other than what I am accustomed to calling it. Fora come up short if you don't know what to search for. Also, many fora seem to "disappear" periods from one's search criterion and find nothing at all when I know the answer is in there somewhere. I've seen fora I like and some I don't. Some are crap. Some are fine. But my first source of info is searching my personal mail archive of mailing lists on my own machine.

And you are irrational.  I have not told you what to do. I have asked for clarification of your position. Do I need "cred" before I can ask questions?!? I offered to help you provide your forum. Is that a bad thing?!? Look, I'm new to Tor. On day one as a subscriber to this list, you posted a rant making assertions and demanding concessions, not to mention making an ultimatum.
I asked for clarification of the issue. Repeated requests finally coaxed some answers out of you and it became clear that you simply prefer forum-type communities to email and that you believe this to be true of most "newbs". I offered to set up a forum of your choice, gratis, for you to manage and you decided I'm a troll.
Is that ultimatum still good to go? Perhaps you should teach the Tor community a good lesson by making good on it. (That's right, I'm calling your bluff.)
