Hello everybody.
I Have a weird problem with Tor. Every once in a while when I'm happily
browsing the net with Firefox 1.5.0.1 using Tor 0.1.1.17-rc, I get this error
from Firefox, saying "Website Certified by an Unknown Authority... Unable to
verify the identity of  as a trusted site". The message
always warns me from the same site,  the strangest part is
that I'm not trying to access the site at all.
It doesn't matter what site I'm trying to access, or is Firefox only updating
my RSS feeds. I tried to sniff my traffic with Ethereal, but it didn't seem
that my host was accessing the hackshaven ip at all.
I noticed that there is a Tor node named "hackshaven", and it shares the same
ip with the site, so I'm guessing it's the same host=) I also tried to add
the node to the excludenodes list, but it didn't seem to do any good.
So my question is, what the hell is happening here? Sounds really fishy to me.
Could it be something involving the way the SOCKS proxy works? But doesn't it
interact with the Tor nodes in a "different level"? Is hackshaven trying to be
a man-in-the-middle, or is this something else?
Please explain this to me, I'm confused.

Yes, I know what a self-signed certificate is.. But the point is, that i'm not trying (or wanting) to access hackshaven at all. It doesn't matter if I'm on google, or anywhere else, the message still comes popping up from time to time. Actually, it doesn't even matter if I'm using a https connection or not.

I'm running Linux and the problem only occurs when I'm using Tor, so I don't think that's the case here. I also observe/analyze my network traffic, so I don't think that my host(s) are part of a botnet.
Any other clues?
