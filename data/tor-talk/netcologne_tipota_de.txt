@_subject: [tor-talk] fingerprint/IP 
Because no newer tor would run on my old hp-workstation, I installed
one on a NSLU2. OK, I installed several ones after another, and now there are several known fingerprints that correlate my (fixed) IP.
It seems, therefore the final relay gets not to be listed, although
client funcionality works fine.
Is there a need for further actions from here, or will this come to
work even without any selective measure?
