* They can't sue you for something one other did through youre node and they have to proove that it was you how did it
* They are allowed to confiscate your server and come to you house an confiscate your pc there if someone did a crime through your node because they have to check that not you did that crime and trie to blur your tracks by setting up a tor node before
* You don't have to log before 01.01.2009
* Well what do you think how :) People are encouraging others to set up a node too, and so the system and with it the speed and security gets better.

@_subject: Provider 1blu closed exit node torpaulianer 
Here's an answer from 1blu why they are closing the tor-servers:
Short in english:
1blu are saying, that if they are not closing the servers after a third-party contacted them about an abuse from this server, they would make themselves liable. So they take the servers offline and are forcing the owners to sign a forbearance-declaration.

@_subject: How to get the smallest OS possible to run Icecat(firefox) 
I will try to make a really really small OS. All it should do is running IceCat(Firefox) and maybe Sylpheed and Gajim. The reason is I wanna test a little bit with running this OS in a vmware and sending all traffik of this child-system over Tor. So the OS just needs to run within a virtual-machine and just needs to run 3 or 4 applications.
How shall I start with this project? Any idea?

I tried the Jabber-client Gajim and wanted to replace pidgin with it. So I configured my account and wanted to setup my Tor-connection and what did I see? Gajim just supports http-proxys? So I first tried it the default way with using Tor: 127.0.0.1:9050 with Gajim. I pushed connect and I got an error in my Tor-logs telling, that Tor is no http-proxy. If I try now Privoxy with it, nothing happens with Gajim. It nevern connects...

@_subject: Tor blocking german nodes 
because in germany fascist laws will force tor-nodes to log their connections I'm looking for a way to blog german tor-nodes. Is there any way to do this with Tor? I found ExcludeNodes just taking nicknames and no IP-ranges which is pretty bad. Couldn't this be implemented? I mean Tor knows the IP of the nodes so why not making it possible to blog IP-ranges with wildcards like 145.253.*.* ?
Then I found this old post:  which has a script which grabbs the nicks of nodes from a website and puts it into ExclueNodes. But first the website it takes this info from is down:  and second this is just a messy solution to the problem.
So why not implementing an IP-based ExcludeNodes? Much would be won with it and nothing loosed..
Is there any other workaround known at the moment to block german IP's?

On Thu, 22 Nov 2007 19:36:31 +0100
Thats my opinion of someone who has to do with law and as a german.
First this is a german problem and not one of the EU. The EU-guideline doesn't contain anything about the logging of anonymising services. This is just and only in the german implementation of this guideline into national law. Other EU-countries like NL didn't do this. So far as said only germany took hands on anonymisers and they are definitly not forced to do so by the EU. Second the problem is not only with Exit-nodes. All german nodes (entry,middle and exit) are forced to log who connected to them and what they manipulated on the packet. So if you are accidently just connected to german nodes they got you. There's afaik no way in tor to prevent that this happens. Maybe blocking all german nodes would be too much and as you said destroying the network but at least there have to be taken care that not more than 1 node comes from germany.

Yes an IP-based solution which identifys a node of a certain country would be a good solution to this.
On Thu, 22 Nov 2007 22:09:11 +0100
TorK allows you to choose the Country where the exitnode is. But its KDE-based and uses many of the KDE-libs... so I as fluxbox user am not happy with it.

I didn't want to spread panic or so. I know that the law is not in action at the moment and many things can happen. The BVerfG and the EuGH, both can stop the data retention law.
But maybe it's not unwise not to be unprepared if the law will not be dumped by any court. Anyway it should be a good idea to change Tor in its working so that a connection is always build through three nodes, which all come from different countrys.

What wanna Chinese do if they just have exit-routers? Phishing unsecured logins or trying to fake ssl certificates? Just with exit-routers you can't compromise the anonymity of the tor network. If the user doesn't act stupid...

No they are not by the EU Convention but just in the german law!
You mean ?113 TKG not StPO ;)
Indeed Raven did a good summary of the new german law.
I don't totally understand what you wanna do?? Simply create a new user-account with ssh-rights and give him read permissions on the IP-logs. That's all. The user can then read it realtime with "wait --n=1 tail -n 50 /var/log/iplogs" and has no access to any other things on your PC. Or what did you mean?
If you don't log IPs by default you gonna face the court the same as you don't give them real-time access. So trying to fool them brings nothing: giving them an account which can't read logs.. it would be the same as giving them no account at all.

@_subject: Maybe Firfox isn't the best choice for privacy? 
I found this article called "total recall on firefox":  it describes a method of calculating hashes for a surfer depending on which plugins he uses. While I think that this wouldn't allow to determine one person it could decrease the user-group in which you want to hide yourself.
What do you think about this?

Yes but the true magic of this method is working without JS, just with xhtml as I understood it? So it would also detect you using torbutton and calculate the hash on serverside for you.

Well I think/guess/believe/hope ;) if the police realizes that the IP-address has its origin in foreign countries they will know that it's very very complicated to confiscate this server and simply stop further investigations. With france that's something special because I think I can remind about some special agreement about the cooperation of their feds..

@_subject: Why is TorButton and not FoxyProxy so much supported by the tor 
I myself am using the foxyproxy plugin and not torbutton. With foxyproxy I simply make a blacklistrule which routes evertyhing through tor and only whitelist pages I'm really trusting.
With TorButton I see many problems:
 * People use Tor and surfe the web. They then wanna visit a page they trust and switch off TorButton. On this page they visit a link or so and forget about not using tor anymore and are possibly redirected to somewhere they don't want to be visible.  * Someone visits a webpage he thinks he can trust without tor but the domain went down before and is now redirecting to some jerks. Something similar happend with dl.am a few weeks ago..
 * Or some xss is going on and some hostile webserver gets their IP through an iframe and kinds of that.
 * Surfing two websites, one with tor and the other not at the same time is nearly impossible with torbutton. I know I can start loading a page with torbutton and then deactivate torbutton and start loading another page and the first one still loads to the end with using tor but at the moment I wanna click a link there I'm fucked...
All these are things which you don't have to be afraid when using foxyproxy. When you leave your trusted page willing or not or some iframe comes from another domain...you are still save.
What can Torbutton better? Okay I have to confess its a bit easier to configure but also this is no great advantage. The time developing tor-button could have been used to ship a default-tor config for foxproxy. So foxyproxy isn't that hard to configure in contrast to torbutton and you could as said make it even simpler by shippen a default-tor config.
The next thing I heard about in Roger Dingledines speach at the 24c3 is that they now are going to reinvent the wheel in torbutton :) They are planning to include the feature of noscipt,cookiesafe,refcontrol and modifyheader in Torbutton. First I have to say that I'm long time waiting for all these plugins being gathered in one tool, all sharing the same white-and blacklists and so on. But will Torbutton finally have the ability to black-and whitelist pages?

@_subject: Two little questions: Whats to preferr socks4, 4a or 5? And how to 
So my first question is: If an application like an IM gives me the choice between a socks4, 4a or 5 proxy, what is preferrable?
The second one is: In a lan I can set up one Tor-client and make all other pcs use it or? I found an old tutorial about socksbindaddress within torrc but I can't find it in the manual but just sockslistenaddress. But I don't understand sockslistenaddress totally:
SocksListenAddress IP[:PORT]
              Bind to this address to listen for connections from Socks-speak?
              ing  applications.  (Default:  127.0.0.1) You can also specify a
              port (e.g. 192.168.0.1:9100).  This directive can  be  specified
              multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports.
In the standard torrc is written if sockslistenaddress is 127.0.0.1 no other can connect to this client expect the localhost? So do I have for every PC in the Lan to take its IP and make a own sockslistenaddress-line?
Like I have 4 PCs with the IPs 1,2,3,4 . Now 1 is running a Tor-client I have to write:
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1
SocksListenAddress         2:9050
SocksListenAddress         3:9050
SocksListenAddress         4:9050
Is this correct? Am I winning something with using another Port for different PCs? And is there any difference between:
SocksPort 9050
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1:9050 ?
And can I setup my Tor-Client that every pc in the lan no matter what IP it has, can use it?

I tested pidgin 2.2.1 on linux and the DNS-Leaking is related to the plugins of the different protocols and not pidgin itself. So ICQ e.g. is not leaking the dns but Jabber is!

@_subject: Annoying polipo problem on linux 
I'm trying to switch from privoxy to polipo. But polipo seems to have an annoying problem. Polipo gets started as a service while booting, the same as I did with privoxy. But tor gets just started with activating Vidalia. The problem is if tor is not running when polipo gets started it doesn't use it! I mean if I start Vidalia+Tor and Polipo has been started before Polipo doesn't use Tor. But I can't start tor before polipo because I wanna use it with Vidalia. So I have every boot to manually start polipo with sudo /etc/init.d/polipo start. Has anyone a workaround for this?

No. If you have a NAT-router outgoing connections are allowed by default just incomming may be blocked in certain circumstances. But that's not interesting for you. If you are not behind a fascist firewall you don't have to change anything. Tor will run fine for you as a client.
UPNP (that's what torrent-clients do) is failure by conception and shouldn't be used by anyone.
Just check you're DNS-requests with tshark -S -i YOUR_NETWORK_DEVICE -R dns and look if it works for you :)
Yes with Privoxy I also have seen this problem sometimes. But never with Polipo so I think that's a Privoxy-Problem not a Tor one.
