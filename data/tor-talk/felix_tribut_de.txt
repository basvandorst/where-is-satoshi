No, what you apparently did was install the DDG extension for firefox. Which very cleary advertises the  feature you don't like: Which, btw is the reason I don't have any of their extensions installed. But you can hardly blame the extension for doing what it tells you it Also, not related to Tor.

That seems like a dangerous idea. Anyone could easily set up a transparent proxy behind a .onion domain. If I can convince your project to include that .onion (which sounds easy given that most site owners will not know about it) I now have active MITM capability against anyone using that extension.
You would have to make it very clear that it is a censorship-resistance tool, not a privacy tool.

Using Tor gives you a few properties that no other instant messaging solution can currently provide.
  - The IM server can not learn your IP.
  - A network observer can not learn that you are using IM (just that you are using Tor).
  - You cannot block the IM service without blocking Tor.
Furthermore, there are (in my opinion) still some serious problems with TextSecure, most importantly:
  - Only phone numbers as identifiers.
  - Sends your address book to the server in full (hashed, but that doesn't mean anything for phone numbers). No opt-out if you want to use the push transport.
  - Requires Google Play to be installed and uses GCM for notifications.
Though moxie has plans to address these problems, they currently exist.

not really. There are plans for a desktop client with email as identifier. Also, opting out of out-discovery of contacts (i.e. sending your whole address book to the push server) is both planned and Other than that I agree - the Tor use-case is a different one.

The release tags for onionshare in Git are signed, so to verify the current version use:
$ git tag --verify 0.7.1
If you are happy with the result, checkout the release
$ git checkout 0.7.1
and then continue with building your package.

Hashing the deb is most likely not going to work. Having a build process that results in a bit-wise identical binary is a hard problem (search for "reproducible build" if you're interested). You should use the verification tools provided, that is the detached signature for pre-built binaries and the signed commits when building from source (see my other mail).
