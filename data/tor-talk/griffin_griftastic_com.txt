============================== START ==============================
Hey all,
Got a weird error while attempting to install Tor on a fresh Ubuntu
lucid machine:
grif at grif-desktop:~$ sudo apt-get install tor tor-geoipdb
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       Reading state information... Done
Package tor is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
E: Package tor has no installation candidate
The browser bundle works fine, but I'm not sure that it would be
sufficient for hidden service use.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser question regarding NoScript 
Hi Ryan,
  You'd still be anonymous without it, but using NoScript has its benefits. There's a bit of a speed increase because you're not loading all of the extra scripts that most sites have (including visitor tracking scripts like Google Analytics).    ----- Original Message -----   From: Ryan smith   To: tor-talk at lists.torproject.org   Sent: Tuesday, November 29, 2011 3:21 AM
  Subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser question regarding NoScript
  Hi, If I am using the Tor browser bundle, does having the NoScript addon enabled offer any benefit? Would I still be completely anonymous if I used Tor browser with NoScript disabled?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google as default search engine revisited 
I set the default search engine to DuckDuckGo when not using the
browser bundle, and before that Yahoo was my default. DuckDuckGo seems
to be a bit faster than Yahoo, but both work better than Google's almost
constant search failure.
  Having a hidden service as the default search might improve speed even
more, but it's worth testing at least =)
