Does that imply that the exploited "weakness" is not yet fully

Also this point suggests that the "attack" has not been understood yet(?).

Should relay ops get ready to deploy a critical patch?
Should users get ready to update their Tor Browser Bundles soon?

Does this imply that you try to fix the issue with an confirmed "bad
relay" before assigning them the badexit flag?
(opposed to flagging them first - which means protecting users first and
then trying to get this fixed? - removing the flags after recovery)
from the comment reply to this sentence:
(yes, "a sufficient number of directory authority operators" is
probably more accurate than "we")
..but are you really saying that "every other day or week" the
majority of dir auth. operators are "removing a relay descriptor from
the network consensus"?
(making them "disappear" opposed to giving them i.e. the badexit flag)
If the removal rate is so high ("every other day or week") where can
we find a list of all relays that have been removed from the consensus
in the past so far?
This process should be transparent, no?
I tried to find 'rejected' flagged relays on the following page but
wasn't successful.

I raised this question already some time ago [1] but I guess the
discussion there ended with the busy PETS week ;)
I believe it would be beneficial if a broader audience can receive and
review bad-relay reports [2].
One important property would be increased transparency in the process
that might lead to badexit flags or in relays being completely removed
from the consensus.
It would also allow people that are worried about such malicious
relays to find out faster and protect themselves earlier (faster than
dir auth. operators might agree on something).
What would be the catch with making these reports and discussion
public? Would it help bad actors? They will eventually find out about
the consensus changes anyway, no?
In the meantime:
I you report a bad relay please send it CC to tor-talk or tor-relays
so we can still have discussions like [3].

Will dir auth ops make the list of rejected relays including its
reason for removal available to the public for transparency?
If I understand option AuthDirReject correctlty, a dir auth. is not
voting for such a relay with the 'rejected' flag*, it is simply not
putting that relay in its vote at all.
So there is currently no way to determine whether a relay has been
"disappeared" by dir auth ops or the relay op decided to discontinue
running the relay itself?
(I was not looking for BadExit relays - they are easy to spot in the
*) actually there is no such thing as a 'rejected' flag

You might find the proven approach used in other areas (security bugs)
a viable option:
Keep the discussion private until a decission has been reached, make
it (the discussion) public once the report has been closed (whether
with or without a flag or reject entry).
This allows for transparency while at the same time shouldn't
interfere with ongoing investigations.

I would have a question regarding the bw-flags graphs on metrics.tpo [1]
"guard bw history"
a) Does this include the entire accumulated traffic of relays having
the guard flag? (which would include the traffic of a guard relay
acting as a middle or exit relay - if it also has the exit flag)
b) Does this only and exclusively include the entire accumulated
traffic that *enters* the tor network via all guard relays?
(to actually do that the traffic accounting on relays would have to do
accounting accordingly on a per connection type level)
Which would bring me to the next question (which would be required to
actually do the required accounting for (b)): Is a relay able to tell
whether it is being used as first or second hop solely by looking at
packets (not their source)?
