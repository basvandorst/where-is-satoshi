1) It depends on the version of TBB/OS/AV. For example entry from TWN:
An anonymous reporter reported [11] a potential leak when using the Tor Browser Bundle 2.3.25-10 on Windows. If Microsoft Security Essentials or another cloud based anti-virus solution is configured, downloads will
automatically be sent to these external providers ? bypassing Tor ? once
The reporter suggested setting the
?browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone? property to ?false? to prevent
anti-virus solutions from starting without user interaction.

I am not sure about the idea how Tor would get involved but check out this list [1].I guess there are several projects you might be interested in.

Welcome to the ninth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the determined Tor community.
Orweb Security Advisory
Users continue to have trouble verifying package signatures. One user was confused when the signature was automatically saved as a ?.txt? file. Other problems included not being running the command from the correct directory, and downloading a signature that did not correspond with the downloaded file. Users sometimes write the help desk seeking clarification about misconceptions about Tor. Examples of such misconceptions include ?Is it true that Tor is illegal in the United States?? and ?Is it true that Tor has been compromised by the NSA??. Using Tor is not currently illegal anywhere. For information about the recent vulnerability, users are advised to read the recent blog post on the subject [20].

@_subject: [tor-talk] Literature on anonymity 
Hello guys,
I am doing academic research on anonymity online for my final thesis and
I was wondering if you know any good literature on this topic.
There are a lot of papers dealing with this
( and also inside databases
but are there any noteworthy books? Only one I know about is probably
Code v2 by Lessig but it is just one chapter regarding anonymity.
Thanks for any recommendation!

I am not sure what is the problem here but when using Raspian wouldn?t
sudo apt-get install tor
do the thing? For TBB I think you have to compile it from the source...

Tails 0.21 is out
One person asked why the lock icon on the Tor Project's website was not
outlined  in green. Sites that use HTTPS can purchase different types of
SSL certificates.  Some certificate issuers offer certificates that
supply ownership information, such  as the physical address of the
website operator, for a higher price. Sites that use  these certificates
get the lock icon by their URL outlined in green. The Tor Project  adds
protection to the validity of our SSL certificate a different way, by
supplying  our SSL certificate fingerprint on our FAQ page [23]. You can
double check that  fingerprint on any of the Tor Project's mirror pages
as well [24].
One person wanted to known why a website they were visiting over Firefox
was telling them that they were not using Tor, even though Vidalia told
them that Tor was running.  By default, the Tor Browser Bundle does not
anonymize all the traffic on your computer.  Only the traffic you send
through the Tor Browser Bundle will be anonymized. If you  have Firefox
and the Tor Browser open at the same time, the traffic you send through
Firefox will not be anonymous. Using Firefox and Tor Browser Bundle at
the same time is  not a great idea because the two interfaces are almost
identical, and it is easy to get  the two browsers mixed up, even if you
know what you are doing.

Welcome to the thirteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what's happening in the well-heeled Tor community.
Reimbursement of exit operators
Tails saw its 33rd release on September 19th [7]. The most visible change
might be the upgrade of tor to version 0.2.4.17-rc, which should result
in faster and more reliable access to the network after the sudden bump
in Tor clients [8].
Among other minor bugfixes and improvements, persistence volumes are now
properly unmounted on shutdown. This should prevent data loss in some
situations, and avoid a sometimes lengthy pause upon activation.
It also fixes several important security issues [9]. It is recommended
that all users upgrade as soon as possible [10].
    [7]     [8]     [9]    [10] New Tor Browser Bundles released
Small offsets in system time offer an attractive opportunity for
fingerprinting Tor clients. In order to eliminate unnecessary exposure,
Nick Mathewson has been working on proposal 222 [18].
Unfortunately, this process introduced a bug into the tor daemon which
became apparent after the directory authority named ?turtles? was
upgraded. The result was that relays started to warn their operators of
an implausible clock skew [19]. This was, of course, a false alarm.
The issue was quickly worked around, and fixed properly a few hours later [20].
   [18]    [19]    [20] Tor Help Desk Roundup
Jacob Appelbaum inquired with VUPEN about the Tor Project having the
right of first refusal for Tor Browser bugs, in order to protect users [23].
   [23] The proposed Tor page on Stack Exchange has now reached 100% commitment,
and will soon be launching as a live beta. Thanks to everyone who signed
up! [24].
   [24] sajolida reported on the latest Tails ?low-hanging fruits session?. The
date and a tentative agenda for the next online contributors meeting have
also been set [25,26].
   [25]    [26] As GSoC entered its final phase, Kostas Jakeliunas reported on the
searchable metrics archive [27], Johannes F?rmann on EvilGenius [28], and
Cristian-Matei Toader on Tor capabilities [29].
   [27]    [28]    [29] How can we provide Tor users an easy way to verify the signatures on Tor
software? Sherief Alaa raised this question on the tor-dev mailing list
when asking for comments on plans to write a ?small? GUI tool [30].

Welcome to the third issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Future of the geolocalization database used in Tor software
Alex reported [17] his bad experience with Hetzner when attempting to
participate in the ?Trusted Tor Traceroutes? experiment [18]. Paul
G?rgen reported [19] having similar troubles, even with a lower packet
per second rate. Relay operators might want to warn their ISP before
undertaking the experiment in the future to avoid similar misadventures.
   [17]    [18]    [19] Anupam Das reported [20] that they have ?received a good rate of
participation by relay operators to our measurement project? [18]. To
measure progress, there is now a live scoreboard [21] of all
   [20]    [21] The integration of ?pluggable transports? in the main Tor Browser
Bundle [22] is moving smoothly. David Fifield published beta images of
his recent work [23], and the initial implementation adding a default
set of bridges to Tor Launcher [24] has been completed.
   [22]    [23]    [24] Following up on last week call for help [25] regarding Tor Weather [26],
Karsten Loesing is organizing an IRC meeting [27] with interested
developers on Wed, Jan 22, 18:00 UTC. The meeting will happen in
 on OFTC.
   [25]    [26]    [27] As part of the website redesign effort, Marck Al proposed [28] an
updated visual identity. Lunar also highlighted a couple of tasks [29]
that could be undertaken to move the website redesign forward.
   [28]    [29] Tails? release calendar [30] has been shifted by two weeks because of
the holiday break from Mozilla [31].
   [30]    [31] Ximin Luo has been discussing with I2P [32] developers on how Pluggable
Transports [33] could be made easier to use by other projects [34].
   [32]    [33]    [34] Isis Lovecruft has sent late reports on her activity for October [35],
November [36] and December 2013 [37].
   [35]    [36]    [37] There are two weeks left to participate in the crowdfunding campaign
started by the Freedom of the Press Foundation [38]. Among other
projects, the money will support core Tor development and Tails 1.0
