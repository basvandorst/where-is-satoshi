Reply-To: bendrath at zedat.fu-berlin.de
Declan, something for Politech? Very bad news from Europe.
The European Parliament this morning voted in favour of a backroom deal
that had been made between the two big parties in Brussels and the Council
of Ministers, currently chaired by the UK. The deal completely ignored the
amendmends proposed by the Parliament's Rapporteur and by the Justice and
Civil Liberties Committee that was (well - officialy) in charge of the
process. After a hot debate and a number of signs of cracks in the party
blocks, a majority of 378 parliamentarians voted in favour of mandatory
retention of telecommunications data, 197 against, 30 abstained.
This is in short what we will get now:
- retention of telephone and internet connection data (including email
addresses) and location data for mobile phone calls
- no harmonisation of the retention period (6 to 24 months but longer is
allowed: Poland wants 15 years)
- no harmonisation of cost reimbursement for the needed investments on the
providers' side
- no limitation to certain types of crimes for which access is allowed
- retention of unsuccessful call attempts
- no independent evaluation
- no extra privacy safeguards
- follow-up committee without representation from civil rights organisations
Civil liberties organizations, consumers organizations and all the telco
industry associations as well as journalists associations had been
fighting like hell against this major and unprecedented surveillance plan
until the last minute. We did not win (the outcome is in fact the worst
possible, exactly what the UK home affairs minister Clarke wanted), but we
at least raised a lot of awareness and disturbed the conservative and
social-democrat party lines. But the UK council presidency had pushed so
hard after the London bombings that this directive will enter the EU
history as the one which took the shortest time ever from the first
Commission draft to the final vote (less than three months - normally they
need years).
The next steps will be the adoption by the Council of Ministers (before
christmas) and then the implementation process into national laws. There
will be challenges to this plan before the constitutional courts. I am
pretty sure that the German constitutional court will not like it, as it
recently had ruled unconstitutional a major eavesdropping plan on phone
calls - and that one was only directed at suspicious persons, whereas the
EU directive applies to every single communication of all 450 Million
inhabitants of the EU.

Roger, the current Tor experience is already terrible as it is.
It would be far more urgent to implement quality metrics (throttle abusers and favor people who donate lots of bandwidth),
and only then to limit the entry barreers (Tor plugin for
browsers, simple one-click installation, NAT penetration, whatever) to
draw in more users. Injecting chaff will only drive the network
into unusability for interactive use, so only abusers with robots
are left. Please don't go there.
The current directive (which is not yet even binding law, until
passed locally) asks for logs -- on the side of commercial providers.
So your ISP sniffs Tor traffic (it's a lot of traffic), and sends
the logs to fur-browed knuckledraggers somewhere. What are they going
to with it?
They're not TLAs. TLAs may very well consider Tor broken (in fact,
I've heard such hints through the grapevine), do I care very much?
Not really, it's not my threat model. I just want to maintain
some privacy online, and not be subjected to profiling and censorship.

I'm an unusually patient user. I can tolerate delays, and DNS
lookup failures, and periods where the exit node is b0rked and
I have to wait for a new circuit. I don't like it, but I usually
can live through it.
An average user tries it once, and gives it up. (This is not a
hyperbole. Try it with a statistically significant set
of naive users). Henceforth, his association chain is Tor=dog slow and/or unreliable. This is not a good association
chain. I see Tor primarily as a) hard to block (since dynamic and geographically diverse) and hard to sue (since noncommercial) list of anonymizing proxies b) something that increases the opaque (encrypted) traffic background. As such I would like to see more users, and a larger network. The only way to draw more users is provide a better experience, and market it. Adding crap nodes to degrade the network is a valid attack mode, so if the protocol can't handle it now, it should in the future.
It should be not just servers. It should be *good-quality* servers.
Each client should be also a server by default, and the protocol
should be able to tell the crap nodes from the good ones, and
route accordingly. Periodically probing exit nodes and benchmarking
them is possible, no?
Good point.
Can you make all clients servers by default, and use un-NATed
servers for NAT penetration?
Most legal attack modes are completely thwarted by 1-2 levels of
traffic indirection, even if it's cleartext traffic. The TLAs can already
most likely listen in, whether we like it, or not. Sure there is a
tradeoff between security and usability. But usability results in
more users and more servers, so the network becomes harder to attack.
The point is that this would require international cooperation.
The network is distributed across legal compartments. Tapping just
one compartment isn't enough. Claiming copyright infringement is insufficient incentive.
Sub-TLAs can't cooperate internationally, across several countries.
(This is an educated guess, of course -- if anyone has insider
knowledge, feel free to correct me here.)
Um, you don't want any patches from *me* (and most of my friends
who would fit the bill unfortunately are too busy working the $dayjob). Donating server space and providing commercial incentive for others
to do so is however a plan. We'll see how it goes.

Thanks for a demo of a typical P2P user mindset.  Tragedy of the commons all over again.
John, I personally don't care about your copyright abuse, as long the local legislation doesn't make me personally liable. So far,
it doesn't.
Tor is research. A work in progress. Due to nature of traffic remixing
traffic gets amplified several times (someone here suggested a
multiplication factor of six). Current Tor runs on resources donated by volunteers. In absence of P2P traffic, it would be quite useful
for browsing which is hard to track and blog. Think people
in religious and secular dictatures (U.S. is slowly getting there)
censoring and tracking users to lock them up.
By using P2P, you're harming those users. If the network becomes
abused, the volunteers stop running nodes, and you P2P folks will
have to roll your own anonymizing layer.

Like you, I am extremely concerned about the recent staccato of frankly awful legislation, whether it's coming to U.K., France, Germany, U.S.
or elsewhere.
Creating a usable global network for untrackable anonymous browsing currently
takes precedence over other concerns, such as anonymous open publishing. *Currently*. The future network may be both more robust and protocols
automatically deal with abuse. That time is not now, however. Currently,
Tor needs active means of discouragement for P2P. If you want to change this,
donate speedy servers and/or implement agoric load levelling in Tor.

There's no such thing as a perfect anything in this universe.
But spam filters for email are a lot more mature than spim, voip, irc
or blog spam. Despite publishing my email address about everywhere
and receiving hundreds of spam messages every day I see almost none
(and I don't even use grey/whitelisting, and do not tune my
filters manually -- I would have to do this if there's another
order of magnitude increase in spam volume).
I'm not an old hand, but I've seen a lot of sites vanish into
the great bit bucket in the sky since 1994 or so. Many mailing list
archives have been restored from indivdual's local mboxes. Distributed
P2P filestores are not common yet.
It doesn't matter how it's implemented. It is a widely deployed
technology, and it arguably works.
Yes, for me it does.
No. This means that a mature infrastructure is in place. It doesn't
matter what somebody can do, theoretically, maybe -- assuming the
rest of the world will adopt itt. Write a login or CAPTCHA-authenticated submission script, and publish
it on a web page. It would be a good idea, as I understand most
newcomers don't like email and prefer a web forum interface to
access and post content. It's easy to add that by an external
page, without touching a line of Mailman.
You might want to look into procmail and Beagle. (I personally
don't bother, screen+mutt works for me, I only use procmail
for killfiling).
You should be able to do online banking without requiring email.
Authentication by email-delivered one-time token works well, and is easy to implement. No wonder everybody is using it.
But IP-based authentication works very well, if yours is a static IP.
Sure, there's spoofing, but in practice you can just as well subscribe
to the list and sniff poster addresses, or spam the list directly.
Of course you can use signed mail and Turing tests for authentication,
should that become commonplace.

CPUburn is hand-written assembly language which thrashes your CPU to within
an inch of its life. Sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, there isn't a version
for the Nehemiah, but it still pushes your CPU temperature way over what any
normal flat-out use would be, so you can use it to check for temperature
stability problems. So, there's my "before" temperatures: 57?C under
SETI at home and 64?C under CPUburn, both after the system had been running for
hours, the CPUburn temperature reached after an extra 15 minutes.
A word about CPU temperatures: on older systems, where the CPU doesn't have
an on-die temperature sensor but there's one on the motherboard underneath
the CPU, the sensors under-read, as they touch the back of the CPU not the
hot part of the case. On that kind of system, a reading of 60?C or over is
horrendously high and something should be done to cool the CPU down before
the blue smoke comes out. Some manufacturers' BIOSes adjust the reading to
take into account the under-read, though, so don't panic so long as a cold
system reads somewhere in the high 40s. Anyway, more modern systems where the
CPU does have an on-die temperature sensor, you're getting the CPU core
junction temperature, and you're getting it correctly. VIA specify that the
Nehemiah can tolerate a case temperature of 85?C, which is the equivalent to
an on-die junction temperature of about 110?C with the standard heatsink and
fan, so getting a reading of 64?C is well within safe limits.

I'm not sure that nodes just going catatonic periodically is a behaviour to
encourage. Throttling traffic is something more predictable.
I understand the anonymizing services population is bimodal: you've got some
few really stable nodes, and lots of ephemeral ones. While a network should
be able to handle lots of coming and going, the stable nodes are important.
Does Tor make a distinction between stable and ephemeral nodes? (Trust
metric, if not agoric load levelling).

There's value in social contracts such as a web of trust between operators,
but the best solution is obviously just seeking safety in numbers. If Tor node density
in address space is sufficiently high, both the performance improves (it is not really practical for impatient users right now), and traffic analysis/exit node snooping becomes prohibitive for any adversary (save of the persons controlling

I don't see why it should 'ethically abhorrent' to use GPL software
in a paid for-profit service, e.g. in a private Tor network with a professionally administered, global network of machines.
You're charging the clients for a highly responsive private anonymizing
network, and you need to cover the costs for the hosting (traffic, juice) and administration as well as end user support. This is what the clients are paying for. You have other running costs, plus have to turn a profit
to make it worthwhile.
This doesn't violate the letter, and not even the spirit of the GPL,
provided that you give back any code changes you had to make in the
project, report bugs, etc.
(Of course if this turns out a viable business model donating to the individual
developers is quite desired, but that's strictly an issue of individual
ethics -- in fact this is not just a hypothetical scenario, as I intend

Allright, these are sleazy scumbags.
The problem is that you can't guarantee a given latency and throughput
with a network outside your control. Of course, one could also sell VServers connected with OpenVPN, with Tor/Privoxy which would participate
on the network, when in use. Getting users to pay for the traffic they're not
generating, even if it's relatively cheap (say, 0.20 EUR/GByte) won't be
too easy, though.
Do you think there's a business potential in a OpenVPN-based darknet?
Root server prices are quite low these days, as is traffic, and the trend
is further down.
A few commercial entities peering traffic (I'll route yours if you route
mine) would be quite immune against that attack.

anonymizing services. We'll see..

You have exchange interfaces between the peers (there won't be very many), and measure traffic there. Throttle dynamically to achieve equilibrium,
or charge for overtraffic. Equilibrium would be best, since requiring
zero cash flow.
The interface traffic passes through a node owned by you, and you
measure it using accounting solutions operated by you. The Tor traffic is encrypted, so I don't see how knowing "I pumped 100 GByte
today to A, and recieved 89 GB from A) could endanger anonymity.
Keeping egress logs is different, but nothing prevents Tor operators
from sniffing cleartext traffic today.
With multihomed commercial Tor, you'd require a tap at every point,
and sophisticated traffic analysis to boot.
If there are no exploitable flaws in Tor itself a Tor appliance
which does nothing else, running on a secure, hardended OS is
reasonably difficult to crack.
Single-owner operating multiple Tor nodes would have to jump through
more loops if the routes are dynamic. I would not rely on services of a

I've had a number of people contact me off-list, thanks
for the feedback. If anyone sees potential technical or liability
issues feel free to criticize.
The core idea is to have high-quality Tor servers in different
jurisdictions, owned by different legal entities or persons,
to manage their pool of authenticated users.
Operators charge their subscribers to cover their costs. It might
make sense for several operators e.g. in the U.S. to create
an umbrella/front organization to reduce the overhead of
accounting, marketing, etc. Marketing can be global, in fact (Yahoo or Google AdWords would come to mind).
Similiar could work for EU, or at least Germany.
It would be good to achieve balanced traffic flow (as much
traffic is entering your node as leaves your node), so that
there won't be a need for monetary compensation between
operators. Arguably, throttling traffic to a lowest
common denominator (say, 10 MBit/s) should take care of it automatically, given that each node has about the same number of users.
Whether each operator maintains their own authenticated
users pool, or there will be a common authenticated user
pool (this will require cash flow among operators, and
would violate the compartmentalization rule) is TBD.
I think each operator taking care of their own users
has less potential issues (costs and thus charges to
users will vary somewhat from operator to operator).
I'm suggesting that users authenticate by a server-side
prepackaged (containing the secret) OpenVPN installer. I think for starters we should just stick with anonymized
web access (at the very least definitely no mail and P2P
because of easy abuse potential).

How you would charge your users is entirely at discretion of the individual
operators. I suggest some low-friction payment scheme (PayPal, IBAN bank transfers
for EU users) to reduce entry threshold, but for the truly tin-hatted acceptance of anonymous payment schemes (cash, e-gold & Co) are almost mandatory, even
if almost nobody will make use of it.
For starters, I would limit the service to web browsing and assume a flat
fee (say, 5$/month subscription for basic anonymous browsing via Tor/privoxy).
This can be abused, but this requires some malignancy on part of the users.
Given that the first leg is encrypted but authenticated it's fundamentally
feasible to charge individual users for traffic by the GByte.
Paranoia and willigness to rely on anonymization services provided by
a commercial entity (and subsequent tradeoff in accountability) are somewhat
mutually exclusive. We'll see whether the market will accept it.

There's a tor package for OpenWRT IIRC. Latest Sveasoft Talisman
also supports packages (it would be trivial to convert an OpenWRT

Notice that both firmwares support IPv6 (via 6to4 or SixXS) which makes for more security by obscurity.

There are intrinsic problems with a number of RBL services
which have nothing whatsoever to do with Tor or Wikipedia. Basically,
some operators of RBL services ban whole networks indiscriminately.
E.g. you might find your IP banned just because they ban whole
networks where once upon a time was a spammer. Because of this
using RBLs as spam score functions is a good idea, blocking services
based on RBL presence is not. At work our customers got personally bitten
by this when GMX and a few other large ISPs would up on an RBL
which our hoster has silently switched to (we were not amused).
Some RBLs indiscriminately ban Tor exit nodes as spammers despite
SMTP standard port being blocked in the exit policy. Yes, RBLs can be quite useful. Operators of RBLs find themselves
in the position of some power, which some of them use classical
mobster tactic to ban services they don't think should exist.
We've been through this before. You using RBLs to block
Tor exit nodes to Wikipedia is good. RBLs declaring Tor
exit nodes as spammers despite blocked port 25 in
their exit policy is abusive.
FWIW, this didn't happen to me yet.

something against spoofing, correct?)
I don't. I understand that this is hairy, and just wanted to know
whether it is currently feasible to block specific protocols (such
as BitTorrent) in the ExitPolicy. It is not, so end of story.
It has to be a pretty smart firewall to track an entire BitTorrent
session sufficiently to be able to recognize it and to drop it.
Also, if I had such a firewall which would block outgoing Tor
traffic it recognizes it would not be reflected in the Tor exit policy, and the local Tor node would cheerfully send it out
where it will be chomped up by the firewall. This would violate
the expectations of any user.
So I gathered. Thanks.

Totally anonymous (one-time nym) has zero prestige by definition, this is readily normalized into negative range by relative comparison to
prestige of more persistent nyms (as most anonymous parties are jerks). If the infrastructure tracks the mana trail in a distributed, tamper proof, unfloodable fashion the sufficiently motivated target can make an informed decision on which prestige cutoff he will allow interactions,
and which will be denied.
Wikipedia uses IP addresses for prestige tracking as there is no further identification accessible to them. Known Tor egress IPs have become tainted with negative mana by abuse. Probability of defacement coming from non-Tor address space is sufficiently lower for them to go the easy route to blacklist Tor.

No question there. I perfectly understand why you're blocking
Tor. The current infrastructure does not allow nym reputation
tracking, and it would require changes on your end to query
reputation and classify the new edit by reputation score.
Once/if Tor catches on, and there is an easy way to query nym
reputation with the stock client, it might or might not make sense to change things on your end, provided it's at all worthwhile. Time will tell.
We're not trying to make your life more difficult. We know there's
lots of abuse going on, for a small fraction of legitimate use.
Unfortunately, there's currently no way to curb abuse at our end
without changes to the codebase (and I'm just a small Tor node operator,
not speaking for anyone by myself, in case that wasn't clear). It's good that you can block the Tor exit server, so that problem is not more severe than it is.
Not really, but you've found a solution we both can live with, for
time being, until a better one comes along.
I misstated. My point was that the current infrastructure is a loaded gun.
It can be used for both good, and evil. If you prevent all evil, you will
also prevent all good. Fortunately, the potential for evil is limited, and
can be shielded again (=bad neighborhood in address space).
Precisely. If you can filter the abusers by persistent traits (addresses),
thus limiting the damage on your end, please do so. I'm sorry if I have been
part of the conspiracy to complicate matters at your end, but unfortunately
for time being I think Tor is a worthwhile experiment, and needs continuing,
despite some potential for friendly fire.
Thanks for Wikipedia. You guys rock.

I presume you're already subscribing to RBL IP lists for blog spammers
and similiar, to increase rank classification as new edit as potential spam, requiring explicit human approval before inclusion. If you're not yet using them, you should.
If you're using them, you can just add Tor exit points into your
RBL subscription, in the unlikely case they are not already there
(trust me, they will be there).
As long as Tor doesn't support pseudonyms, and prestige accounting
there won't be a better way. Anonymity by definition is associated
with zero prestige. Current Tor is designed for anonymity, not
pseudonymity. A hidden trusted server could be used as a hack to
implement pseudonyms and prestige tracking. This would not scale,
and be easy to DoS, however.
If it is not to be a hack a distributed cryptographic filestore need to be added to the Tor client. It would require nym prestige
to prevent floods. This is not easy to get right. I hope I'm being clear. From your comments, I'm having the

If you don't include the pseudonym tracking into Tor, the overlap
of people who have both Tor and pseudonym tracking installed will
be very small, and thus have a negligible user base.
At the very least pseudonym tracking should be made an integral
part of Tor installation documentation (just as Privoxy), so that
most users will wind up with installing all of them (assuming,
most Tor operators also have Privoxy installed, of course).
There are two main problems with pseudonym tracking: it must be
implemented as a distributed cryptographic P2P file store with
traffic remixing, so that its operators themselves can't know
what's in the binary blob, and won't be able to modify it.
Another issue is denial of service by e.g. flooding the store
with bogus entries, or using the P2P protocol part to serve
warez, which current Tor tries to prevent. Pseudonym tracking would need pseudonym tracking and only track warm bodies, which would need a Turing test (CAPTCHa, or similiar). As I said, it's not easy to get right.

I see no problem with a customer running Tor as long as they
pay for the traffic. If the CPU load is considerable, it may
ask for a beefier host, which would put it into a slightly more
expensive class (say, 10$ instead of 5$). Of course you can
get a flat rodet physical server for some 30 EUR/month, but these

Seems like a reasonable law? Sure, if you've just put down the crack pipe.
A reasonable law should *protect* the operator.
If the abusive traffic *seems* to originate from your server, then
1) intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass is clearly evident from abuse
   complaint (emails, web server logs, etc).
2) the originator is suddenly you, until proven otherwise
The proof is usually associated with a search warrant, hardware
confiscation (the process is so slow you can consider that loss
permanent), and plenty of quality time spent with your lawyer, and in court.
I can see how this helps making more USians run Tor servers.
But misuse of anonymizing technologies is habitual. The current anonymizing
infrastructure doesn't allow persistent pseudonyms and prestige tracking,
so this is an inevitable side effect of providing anonymizing service at all. We could use a law making operators guilty until proven otherwise like another trepanation.

It's superficially good reasoning, but you have to take both

Depending on the average length of your circuit, you would
have to run many (5-10) servers in order to mitigate the damage you're
doing, and it would still have no impact on the worst case
experience (which can completely turn off people on Tor: the
user experience is one of unreliability).

The great firewall of China
In the space of about a decade, China's tech development has raced ahead to catch up with some of the most advanced countries in the West. But there are still stark differences, finds Richard Taylor.
With a rapidly expanding online population, it is tempting to see China as hurtling full speed towards digital nirvana, but all is not quite what it seems.
Somewhere along the way the idea that the Chinese people should be allowed to inform and be informed appears to have been lost.
China is proof that the net can be developed and strangled all at once.
Being online here is a distinctly hit and miss experience - fine if you want to access mundane content, but try to get into anything considered even remotely sensitive by the government and it soon starts grinding to a halt.
I tried accessing the BBC News website but to no avail. A government official told me there must be what he called "a technical problem".
In truth, those "technical problems" are afflicting more and more information sites in China, for example the open source encyclopaedia Wikipedia, perhaps because it has fallen foul of the government's recent declaration that news and information in today's China should only be what it calls "healthy" and "in the public interest".
One official from the internet publishing department, Kuo Xiao Wei, admitted the authorities consider the net a mixed blessing.
He said it abounds with pornography and gambling sites, and while it can be a source of good information, it also carries with it the possibility of spreading rumour and misinformation.
"With 56 ethnic minorities, we can't risk one slandering another", he added.
Amnesty International is aware of at least 64 cyber dissidents who are imprisoned right now just for peacefully expressing their opinions online, whether it's on an e-mail or a website
Steve Ballinger, Amnesty International
So Chinese netizens find themselves surfing in the shadow of the world's most sophisticated censorship machine, which is now more menacing than ever.
There is now an estimated 30,000-strong internet police force which, with the aid of Western-provided technology, is dedicated to monitoring websites and e-mails.
On a technical level the five gateways which connect China to the global internet filter traffic coming into and going out of the country.
Keyword blocking technology - much of it provided by western companies - is used to prevent access to offending sites.
Even the country's 110,000 internet caf?s are now highly regulated and state-licensed, and all are equipped with standard surveillance systems.
Increasingly, though, the authorities are relying on individuals to censor themselves or risk harsh and well publicised penalties if they dare to challenge the establishment.
Steve Ballinger, of Amnesty International, says: "Amnesty International is aware of at least 64 cyber dissidents who are imprisoned right now just for peacefully expressing their opinions online, whether it's on an e-mail or a website.
"Some of the offences they're accused of are signing an online petition, sending information to a foreign organisation, or disseminating information about the SARS virus."
Corporate China is also expected to play an active part in this self-censorship, keeping a close eye on content.
One website forum administrator was willing to talk to me, but did not want to be identified. Suffice to say, he is in no doubt what his job entails.
He said: "If you say anything against the government we've got to delete it, no exception, because it's a forum, it's a public place. If the government finds anything against them in the forum, that will jeopardise the company."
Finding a way
In spite of all this, many people here simply refuse to be cowed and they are finding some inventive ways to circumvent the restrictions.
The government doesn't know how to control the blog thing. Next year maybe they'll be able to but we'll find other ways of expressing ourselves
Michael Anti, free speech campaigner
One simple and effective way is to turn to other forms of communication, like texting from mobiles and instant messaging, which have proved successful in distributing information quickly.
Blogging is also proving a hugely popular alternative to websites, for individuals to find self-expression.
SOME PUBLIC WEB-BASED CIRCUMVENTION SERVICES
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites
Michael Anti has long been campaigning for free speech. His blog is renowned as being one of China's true sources of information.
He believes the cat and mouse game between the government and its people is set to continue.
"The government doesn't know how to control the blog thing. Next year maybe they'll be able to but we'll find other ways of expressing ourselves."
Equipped with the right know-how, some Chinese are already using more sophisticated technologies to beat the authorities at their own game.
Advanced software for example allows users anonymously to redirect their internet activity through a third-party computer known as a proxy server, which is out of reach of the Chinese authorities.

@_subject: WIRED: Anonymity on a Disk 
By  Quinn Norton | Also by this reporter
WASHINGTON DC -- To many privacy geeks, it's the holy grail -- a totally anonymous and secure computer so easy to use you can hand it to your grandmother and send her off on her own to the local Starbucks.
That was the guiding principle for the members of kaos.theory security research
when they set out to put a secure crypto-heavy operating systems on a bootable CD: a disk that would offer the masses the same level of privacy available to security professionals, but with an easy user interface.
"If Granny's into trannies, and doesn't want her grandkids to know, she should be able to download without fear," says Taylor Banks, project leader.
It's a difficult problem, entailing a great deal of attention to both security details and usability issues. The group finally unveiled their finished product at the Shmoo Con hacker conference here Saturday, with mixed results.
Titled Anonym.OS, the system is a type of disk called a "live CD" -- meaning it's a complete solution for using a computer without touching the hard drive. Developers say Anonym.OS is likely the first live CD based on the security-heavy OpenBSD operating system.
OpenBSD running in secure mode is relatively rare among desktop users. So to keep from standing out, Anonym.OS leaves a deceptive network fingerprint. In everything from the way it actively reports itself to other computers, to matters of technical minutia such as TCP packet length, the system is designed to look like Windows XP SP1. "We considered part of what makes a system anonymous is looking like what is most popular, so you blend in with the crowd," explains project developer Adam Bregenzer of Super Light Industry.
Booting the CD, you are presented with a text based wizard-style list of questions to answer, one at a time, with defaults that will work for most users. Within a few moments, a fairly naive user can be up and running and connected to an open Wi-Fi point, if one is available.
Once you're running, you have a broad range of anonymity-protecting applications at your disposal.
But actually using the system can be a slow experience. Anonym.OS makes extensive use of Tor, the onion routing network that relies on an array of servers passing encrypted traffic to permit untraceable surfing. Sadly, Tor has recently suffered from user-base growth far outpacing the number of servers available to those users -- at last count there were only 419 servers worldwide. So Tor lags badly at times of heavy use.
Between Tor's problems, and some nagging performance issues on the disk itself, Banks concedes that the CD is not yet ready for the wide audience he hopes to someday serve. "Is Grandma really going to be able to use it today? I don't know. If she already uses the internet, yes."
Experts also say Anonym.OS may not solve the internet's most pressing issues, such as the notorious China problem: repressive governments that monitor their population's net access, and censor or jail citizens who speak out against the government.
Ethan Zuckerman, fellow with Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, works extensively with international bloggers and journalists, many of whom live under constant threat from their own governments. He see Anonym.OS as a blessing for some -- but not for those at the greatest risk.
"I think it's going to be tremendously useful for fairly sophisticated users when they are traveling, but where it may not be as effective as people would hope is in counties where the government is really seriously about locking down the net, constraining internet access," Zuckerman says.
Because most people in the developing world use the internet from shared desktop environments, services for them have to consider office place and cyber cafe-based computer situations. "Rebooting isn't often an option," explains Zuckerman, who would like to see anonymity solutions move toward minimally invasive strategies like the TorPark, a USB key that allows access to a Tor enabled browser without rebooting, and private proxies matched up one by one with dissidents.
But kaos.theory members say Anonym.OS is just the first step in making anonymity widely available. Future versions, they say, may run on a USB keychain. Additionally, they plan to implement Enigmail to allow encrypted e-mail for Thunderbird and Gaim Off The Record, which allows users to use instant messaging without their logs being tied to them.
David Del Torto, chief security officer of the non-profit CryptoRights group, says projects like Anonym.OS are heading in the right direction, but thinks the project overreaches by trying to be useful to everyone. "Grandmas are not the ones that need this right now.... My instincts tell me that it's a very small number of people (that can use Anonym.OS). You can't really solve this problem by simplifying the interface. It's almost impossible to anticipate everything a user can do to hurt themselves."

I see tor hardly ever going over 120 kByte/s, yet I have
some 300-450 kByte/s excess bandwidth left. This Debian box
does nothing else but tor.
The system *does* experience periodic (semiweekly) tor crashes,
after which traffic is slow to resume.

Both. Tor used to be really aggressive on this box, now
it's mostly idling. I've verified the pipe should be able
of at least ~500 kByte/s throughput.
I have in /etc/apt/sources.list
deb      sarge main
deb-src  sarge main
deb      experimental-0.1.1.x-sarge main
deb-src  experimental-0.1.1.x-sarge main
i386, 2.6.8-2-686
It's a 1.8 GHz Duron box with 256 MBytes which
typically has some 5-6% tor CPU load and about 30%
memory according to top.
Nothing, the task just dies (I usually notice it by looking
on serifos), and that's it. Nothing in the logs. Perhaps at least
for Debian the init scripts should be more aggressive, and restart
the task immediately when it's crashed.
Nothing unusual as far as I can see:

The thought police has been notified. Expect them shortly.
Why do you think you will get a visit from the police
if you're running a server in a colo? The ISP will bend

Now what would be interesting is whether they will

I can't believe you have actually bought into this tripe about
terrorists, and pedophiles. Consider it the new Godwin's law:
if someone mentions pedophiles, terrorists and drug traffickers
in order to justify wiretapping, that argument is automatically
nil and void.
Are you running a Tor node? You should not be running a Tor node.
So basically I can use bogus pedophile and terrorist charges to
shut down about anybody? No doubt that's terribly convenient for
some people.
What has this to do with turning over your keys because somebody
claims that children are being violated somewhere?

boot. Is the Tor package in Fink? (I haven't installed it yet, since
there's no official Fink package for Leopard).
It would be great to do apt-get type of Tor install and update on OS X.

That's a bit of an overkill for a dedicated machine, unless you want
to serve multiple MBytes/s. The system could easily double as a home
fileserver, etc.
Make sure this is not your weak spot. OpenWRT is a good firmware here.
In general, it is always a good idea to buy a WRAP or ALIX (or its
Soekris equivalent) piece of kit, and flash it with a decent firewall,
like m0n0wall or pfSense.
How much upstream do US cable modem providers offer? My provider
so far has stepped up to 2/30 MBit. They do up to 100 MBit/s in France
(upstream unknown).
I personally find Debian apt-get upgrade type of system installs
preferrable, especially for headless machines/from distance.

Are you sure OpenWRT on a Linksys can't handle the states with 32 MBytes RAM,
and a 0.2..0.5 MBit/s upstream?
I've just looked at the state table (256 kBit/s allocated to Tor middleman via Vidalia) in my pfSense 1.2 RC3, and it has about 360 entries (pfSense uses about 1 k RAM/state). It should be possible to handle some 5 k states with 32 MBytes of RAM,
assuming iptables (or whatever 2.4 uses) scale similiarly.
IIRC just the other day someone mentioned a Tor package for Pfsense -- was
that on this list?
The states never expire? I'm running my router with most conservative
settings. Linksys uses Linux (Vxworks for its more braindead types of routers which
I know nothing about), but the default firmware is pretty pathetic.
Once again I very much recommend using pfSense (or m0n0wall) for your
home router on embedded hardware (the sky is the limit on nonembedded,
I'm running it on a SunFire X2100 M2 at work).

The Tor network so far is largely seen only as an anonymizing

However, it is fully capable of becoming a real Darknet, provided hidden services achieve a critical mass, and there
will be a search engine indexing the lot, preferrably a
distributed one.
All of this, of course, assuming the network would scale

I disagree (as a parent, and a Tor operator who got a BKA case about
pedophilia on his hands, which is still open -- at least there is yet no usual offical letter declaring it closed, so I take that as a negative). Here's why. There's no evidence that access to pedophilia pornography increases abuse rate of the kids. These are your normal garden-variety paraphiliacs. Mostly quite harmless, and quite incurable. If a known offender, best put on a watch list.
Most of the abuse cases occur within the circle of relatives. Since the making of
the material (unless it's completely CGI) involves hurting kids, that is clearly
something which needs to be persecuted. Howevever, arguably it is possible
to trace the social network to the producer nodes in the classical gumshoe and (hardware) bug strategy. Especially, if monetary streams are concerned.
Tracing these back is never particularly difficult (in fact, my own dear country is
perhaps leading in that respect by financial operators voluntarily turning over
their transaction records (on a nice request, not a judge warrant) for some 20 million
credit card customers, matching a transfer of a particular sum to a particular account -- while being vigorously denied being a dragnet investigation, despite
the query being exactly that like a database data-mining query, only
using an institutional API). This is a feel-good strategy. Let's publicly
nail a few widely hated perverts, while studiously avoiding spending some funds, and sending social workers to the families, where most of the cases, and mostly unreported, too, lie.
Also, the real question we really have to ask ourselves is: how much of "guilty until proven innocent" can an open society stand, before becoming something else?
My impression is that most of our western democracies well on their way to becoming something else. Hardly a day passes at which I'm not cringing at the

before stuttering subsided, and only occasional faint artifacts
were heard.

I've got something I can live with.
suggests disabling DirPort if all else fails:
"If you have an asymmetric connection (upload less than download) such as a cable modem, you should set BandwidthRate to less than your smaller bandwidth (Usually that's the upload bandwidth). (Otherwise, you could drop many packets during periods of maximum bandwidth usage -- you may need to experiment with which values make your connection comfortable.) Then set BandwidthBurst to the same as BandwidthRate. Since the BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst options only look at incoming bytes currently, you may find that if you're still seeing too much outgoing traffic, you should turn off your DirPort; most users don't need to do this though."

TrafficShaping wouldn't do much in the call's beginning, until the

Shaper wizard, gave the VoIP device highest priority and allocated a

BandwidthRate 40 KB
BandwidthBurst 40 KB
back in, which seems to work, or at least work most of the time.
I might to have to throttle it some more in case some traffic spikes

Anecdotally, the complaint rate with Tor is typically much higher than with mixmaster, at least in Germany. I've had three distinct contacts
with the police and/or BKA for a Tor node runtime less than a year.
The complaint rate and the kind of encounter might also
differ by locality, some are more law & order than others.
When you're invited by the friendly local police officer in person
to give things to protocol, you're not ruled out to be a suspect.
That's for the investigator to decide (and I would really recommend
to have law insurance for those cases when the investigator is
not convinced you and the party in question are not one and the same).
I also really really recommend to not run a Tor exit node on domestic
broadband in Germany, unless you're prepared to be woken up rather
early and rudely, and have to part with your hardware for a significant
period (if forensics folks are overworked and/or someone wants to harass you sufficiently to discourage other local
operators from running Tor you'll be parted with it effectively
for good). Things should be easier at a colo rental, where the burden
of dealing with hardware confiscation is left with the provider
(of course, the provider might think twice in future about allowing
customers to run Tor in their address space, or cooperate with
the authorities to install a tap). Another thing: sometimes the investigation take their time, so
it can take months after the the initial complaint for the police/BKA to contact you.

Do you have a link to the draft? You don't mention private individuals,

I'm not sure Tor is a "telecommunication service" in the sense of the law,
IANAL, of course. As a middleman, I'm just stripping the skin and
passing on an encrypted payload to somebody else. I do not offer any
access to any web site, etc. This is different from exit nodes.
The difference might be significant enough.
That's not so good.
Assuming our interpretation of a yet unpassed law is correct, it would
depend very much whether this is going to be actively enforced against
middleman nodes, which do not draw direct complaints. In the end, if (note the conditional) the criminalization of anonymizing mix cascades is complete in a certain jurisdiction, or most jurisdictions, I suggest utilizing the few advantages of illegality: deploying Tor as a self-propagating and self-updating botnet vector -- as benign as humanly
possible, of course. It would be very important that whoever is to do that is in no ways connected to the Tor project. By posting to this
list this my purely private (I speak only for myself and nobody
else) opinion, I am of course completely disqualified to do that.
I would also expect and welcome any Tor developers to condemn and
distance themselves from this particular idiotic suggestion here.
How about adding more hops, and/or use jurisdictional compartments
who can't/won't persecute and/or do not cooperate well with each
other. I'm cure we can think of a few tuples off-hand.
Connection data is who is talking to whom, when. It does not
include the contents of the communication. Again, IANAL, but this
is what I've heard so far everywhere. (And I really doubt that
e.g. BKA is well-equipped to deal with several TBytes of opaque
traffic every month).
That looks like a safe bet. I think at this point a few of German Tor operators need to think
whether we should pool funds, and consult a lawyer sufficiently competent

I suggest we stop playing Chicken Little, and first see what
the actual law says when passed, and then consider whether it's worth
complying (in the worst case, I might start logging connection
info (and just that) to an encrypted partition (so seizing hardware
without passphrase will be useless), announce that
much to the list, and post an announcement to the list, including
details, if I'm being contacted and asked for said info -- in
case there's a gag order, I will stop operating -- so if I stop
running shrek/shrek2, and won't tell you why, you'll know why).
If things get bad enough it is actually worthwhile to consider
moving elsewhere. Or revive the White Rose. There's been some talk about ad hoc encryption setup (like ad hoc IPsec
for every TCP/IP session), which would require a MITM to listen to,
which can be detected in principle by storing host fingerprints in a
p2p web of trust, using personal knowledge for as an additional
trust metric. This is quite open to traffic analysis, but at least
what's being said remains invisible, and will be more than a major
nuisance to the gestapo, if deployed widely, and with some
background traffic acting as chaff.
Of course, outlawing encryption will be the next step, and rather soon after that, there will be concentration camps. See you in the showers.

Any idea of what is going on? I can access the Tor network just fine.

shrek2 is unthrottled, and the CPU and memory footprint is in
low 2-10%, while the network throughput is around 3-5% of a 100 MBit line (the switch has a Java applet which
displays traffic bar over the ports). It doesn't seem to be getting any more Does it take a long time until the server gets more traffic?
I'd rather not go away on a long weekend, and come back to 4 days

Any Tor people here who're with Hetzner? It's supposed to be

I don't want it to be restricted artificially (it interferes with directory servers). I also don't want to fill up the pipe and go broke.
But it's moot, anyway, since I burned through some 45 GBytes in a couple of days,
which is above what I'm willing to sustain financially at the moment, so I've
throttled the server.
I'm a notch above of what is an affordable server, and I see no
reason why a multihomed service can't fill a 100 MBit pipe quite

have no illusions about sustainability of such subsidized offers,
because the hoster has clearly no interest in tolerating customers

When you do this, make sure you that the server/IP is not registered
to you personally, and make sure the means of payment are not
traceable to you (cash is good). Offshoring is also possible, but
unfortunately expensive. The thing with Russia (or China) is that
authorities there completely ignore massively illegal operations like
RBN (of course their SIGINT guys may still monitor it, they just
don't act on the intelligence), so with that kind of operator nobody would frown at hosting a Tor exit.
Apart from that my (as always, purely personal, and rather unpopular)
opinion is that once operating Tor without logs has been made illegal,
then it's time for no more Mr. Nice Guy, and let's see how the authorities will deal with a global StormTor network of a million nodes, all exit.
The advantage of malware-vectored Tor is that it's self-propagating/self-hosting,
and it it also boosts the number of users by forcing all traffic on
infected machines through Tor, transparently for the end user.
It will be slightly slower, but the fraction of a malicious exits
will be negligible.

I don't know how well hidden services and current Tor codebase scales,
but having an anonymous communication space is certainly worthwhile,
even if read-only. Do hidden wikis see much defacement, currently?
Not all Tor hosts log, and cooperation between different legal compartments
is much less than within e.g. US and EU. The average network bandwidth
and latency are likely to get much better in future, so the number of
hops in a circuit can be adaptively increased to make attack much more difficult, logs or no.
I agree -- but so far there's no need for it yet. As others have correctly
stated we need to stay in full compliance of the law (as long as that law
is not unconstitutional), to not put public support into jeopardy.
Once however such illegal retention laws have been passed, then only outlaws will have anonymity.

Excluded by laws yet, but still monitored by TLAs. Yeah, I know,

I'll ask them again in a year. Has anyone asked their ISPs yet?
Try to get an official position in writing, these telephone support
call assurances are usually worthless, and those "recorded for
training purposes" things just as easily erased.
But as a middleman you're part of the infrastructure. As a judge/advocatus
diaboli, I would not be convinced that a relay station is excluded from legal
requirements for the connection info. I would be asking to why you think
you should be excluded from legal requirements. The exit nodes can be considered
customers, to whom you're offering telecommunications services, free of
Why, you're still routing the evil packets. Let's say they have
obtained logs from an exit node, and you're the next hop. They want
your logs. You say you can't/won't log, so they cite you into court.
What's the maximum sentence? Up to 500 kEUR, and/or several years in jail?
Um, let's try to be really convincing here. If they want to get nasty,
a criminal record is your minimum. If the exit logs, or is otherwise monitored (ISP logs, or even TLAs
logs, or claims of such logs), and you're the next step in the chain, they'll come to you asking for logs.
I think the only safety is in larger numbers (reduces the fraction of
evil exits), and in increasing the number of hops in the circuit
(as a whole, broadband is getting faster, so adding a hop in two
years might not result in any performance penalty in comparison to
today), so logging becomes largely worthless.
Since I was probably not exactly clear with hints about disposable nodes: there are many rambling (industrial or federal) institutions, where accounting and documentation is very sloppy. It can become very difficult
and time-consuming to find a "rogue" host on the network, especially
if it is physically very small, and can be installed out of sight.
The ALIX boxes are quite optimal for that. Assuming you ever do any such evil deed, make sure you don't leave fingerprints and/or DNA on the device, and that the serial/MAC of the hardware can't be linked to you with the purchase. I would never do such a thing, of course.

FYI: Ultimate Security Proxy With Tor
Nowadays, within the growing web 2.0 environment you may want to have some anonymity, and use other IP addresses than your own IP. Or, for some special purposes - a few IPs or more, frequently changed. So no one will be able to track you. A solution exists, and it is called Tor Project, or simply tor. There are a lot of articles and howtos giving you the idea of how it works, I'm not going to describe here onion routing and its principles, I'll rather tell you how practically pull out the maximum out of it.
So, let's start.
Major disadvantages of tor, with all its benefits like security (however, tor manufacturers advice not to rely on its strong anonymity, because there are some cases, when it is possible to track young h4x0r...) are:
1. Long enough session (60 seconds for one connection per one exit node, that means, that you will have one external IP for a minute)
2. Slow perfomance (request takes up to 20 seconds to complete, what makes surfing sites with lot of elements a disaster)
3. All the requests come through one node, and possibly route how your requests arrive can be calculated.
In order to fight these three we are going to use:
1. 8 tor processes, each using separate spool directory
2. 8 privoxy processes, each configured to talk to separate tor.
3. First squid, with malware domains blacklist, will have 8 round robin cache peers configured. (squid-in)
4. Havp, with squid-in as parent. (Anti-virus proxy, using clamav :) )
5. Second squid, that will use havp as parent (squid-out). Users will connect to this one.

on an advertised 10 MBit/s flat rodent) but then decayed down to 177 kByte/s.

Also, when I received a faxed complaint from BKA accusing me of peddling

and EUServ support (always sluggish) went completely incommunicado.
Methinks the server was seized for forensic examination. It isn't too
far-fetched to conjecture they logged the entire traffic on authority
request, and then yielded the Tor node key for subsequent decryption.
This smells. Caveat emptor. Use EUServ as middleman at best, if you must.

How anonymity technology could save free speech on the Internet.
By David Talbot
"Sokwanele" means "enough is enough" in a certain Bantu dialect. It is also
the name of a Zimbabwean pro-democracy website whose bloggers last year
published accounts of atrocities by Robert Mugabe's regime and posted
Election Day updates describing voter intimidation and apparent ballot
stuffing. You can visit Sokwanele's "terror album" and see photographs: of a
hospitalized 70-year-old woman who'd been beaten and thrown on her cooking
fire (she later died, the site says); of firebombed homes; of people with
deep wounds carved into their backs. You can find detailed, frequently
updated maps describing regional violence and other incidents. You will be
confronted with gruesome news, starkly captioned: "Joshua Bakacheza's Body
Because this horrific content is so readily available, it is easy to overlook
the courage it took to produce it. The anonymous photographers and
polling-station bloggers who uploaded the Sokwanele material remain very much
in danger. In a place like Zimbabwe, where saying the wrong thing can get you
killed or thrown in prison on treason charges, you take precautions: you're
careful about whom you talk to; you're discreet when you enter a clinic to
take pictures. And when you get to the point of putting your information on
the Internet, you need protection from the possibility that your computer's
digital address will be traced back to you. Maybe, at that point, you use
Tor is an open-source Internet anonymity system--one of several systems that
encrypt data or hide the accompanying Internet address, and route the data to
its final destination through intermediate computers called proxies. This
combination of routing and encryption can mask a computer's actual location
and circumvent government filters; to prying eyes, the Internet traffic seems
to be coming from the proxies. At a time when global Internet access and
social-networking technologies are surging, such tools are increasingly
important to bloggers and other Web users living under repressive regimes.
Without them, people in these countries might be unable to speak or read
freely online (see "Beating Surveillance and Censorship").  Video
Unlike most anonymity and circumvention technologies, Tor uses multiple
proxies and encryption steps, providing extra security that is especially
prized in areas where the risks are greatest. Paradoxically, that means it's
impossible to confirm whether it's being used by the Zimbabwean bloggers.
"Anyone who really needs Tor to speak anonymously isn't going to tell you
they use Tor to speak anonymously," says Ethan Zuckerman, cofounder of Global
Voices, an online platform and advocacy organization for bloggers around the
world. "You can't tell if it's happening, and anyone who is actively evading
something isn't going to talk about it." That said, the ?Sokwanele
journalists "are extremely sophisticated and use a variety of encryption
techniques to protect their identity," he says.
Anonymity aside, Internet users in dozens of countries--whether or not they
are activist bloggers--often need to evade censorship by governments that
block individual sites and even pages containing keywords relating to
forbidden subjects. In 2006, the OpenNet Initiative--a research project based
at Harvard and the Universities of Toronto, Oxford, and Cambridge that
examines Internet censorship and surveillance--discovered some form of
filtering in 25 of 46 nations tested, including China, Saudi Arabia, Iran,
and Vietnam.
In a new and still-evolving study, OpenNet found that more than 36 countries
are filtering one or more kinds of speech to varying degrees: political
content, religious sites, pornography, even (in some Islamic nations)
gambling sites. "Definitely, there is a growing norm around Internet content
filtering," says Ronald Deibert, a University of Toronto political scientist
who cofounded OpenNet. "It is a practice growing in scope, scale, and
sophistication worldwide."
Tor can solve both problems; the same proxies that provide anonymous cover
for people posting content also become portals for banned websites. When it
officially launched five years ago, the Tor network consisted of 30 proxies
on two continents; now it has 1,500 on five continents, and hundreds of
thousands of active users. And its developers are trying to expand its reach,
both abroad and in the United States, because digital barriers and privacy
threats affect even the free world. In the United States, for example,
libraries and employers often block content, and people's Web habits can
be--and are--recorded for marketing purposes by Internet service providers
(ISPs) and by the sites themselves. "The Internet is being carved up and
filtered and surveilled," says Deibert. "The environment is being degraded.
So it's up to citizens to build technologies to [counter these trends]. And
that is where I see tools like Tor coming into play. It preserves the
Internet as a forum for free information."
Neutral Nodes The product of a small nonprofit organization with eight paid
developers and a few dozen volunteer security professionals around the world,
Tor takes advantage of the fact that Internet traffic consists of two-part
packets. The first part contains data--pieces of a Web page you are viewing,
or of the photo file or e-mail you are sending. The other consists of the
Internet protocol (IP) address of the sending and receiving computer (plus
other data, such as the size of the file). Tor uses the latter portion--the
addressing information--to build a circuit of encrypted connections through
relays on the network (see "Dodging Spies, Data Miners, and Censors" next
page). The requisite relays (which collectively serve as proxies) are
operated on a volunteer basis at universities such as Boston University and a
few corporations, and by computer-security professionals and free-speech
advocates around the world. (Many Tor users also use existing technologies,
such as HTTPS--a protocol for encrypting and decrypting a user's page
requests and the pages that are returned--to protect the content they are
sending and receiving.)
Tor, like the Internet itself, emerged from military research--in this case
at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, which built a prototype
in the mid-1990s. The military interest was clear: without a way to make
Internet traffic anonymous, an agent's cover could be compromised the minute
he or she visited .mil domains using the Internet connection of, say, a
hotel. Even if the data were encrypted, anyone watching traffic over the
hotel network could quickly figure out that the guest might be associated
with the U.S. military. And the problem is hardly limited to hotel networks;
IP addresses can be linked to physical locations by a variety of means (ISPs
correlate such data with phone numbers, data miners can piece together clues
from Internet traffic, and someone outside your house can confirm that you
are the source of specific kinds of Internet traffic by "sniffing" data
traveling over Wi-Fi). As a Tor presentation puts it, chillingly, what might
an insurgent group pay to get a list of Baghdad IP addresses that get e-mail
from a .gov or .mil account?
The navy project never emerged from the lab, but it attracted the interest of
Roger Dingledine, a cryptographer concerned about a different aspect of
Internet privacy: the way ISPs and websites amass databases on people's
browsing and search history. In 2000, at a conference where he was presenting
his MIT master's thesis on anonymous distributed data storage, he met a Naval
Research Lab mathematician, Paul ?Syverson. The two men saw that tools for
protecting military agents and tools for protecting Web surfers' privacy
could be one and the same, and together they revived the project with funding
from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the navy.
The first public version of Tor, which came out in 2003, was available for
anyone who cared to install it. But it worked only on open-source operating
systems, and using it required at least some technical knowledge. The
Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil-liberties organization,
funded development of a version for Windows, and soon a wider variety of
users emerged. "Originally one ofocks many websites--including Facebook,
YouTube, and Skype--from all Web users in the nation. I spoke about Syrian
censorship with another blogger, Anas Qtiesh; he sat in an Internet caf? in
Damascus as I messaged him from my living room. Qtiesh isn't worried that
he'll be tracked down, because he tends to blog about pan-Arab politics, not
about criticisms of the regime. But he wants access to more of the Internet
than the government permits, so the Firefox browser on his laptop sports the
Torbutton. Click the button, and presto--the same Internet that everyone in
America sees. To access blocked sites, his computer negotiates a series of
proxies, eventually connecting to an IP address somewhere else in the world.
This intermediary fetches the blocked material. "Tor brings back the
Internet," he wrote.
Qtiesh has plenty of company: Tor was always of interest abroad, but word of
mouth and the introduction of the easy-to-use Torbutton have helped
accelerate its global spread. Zuckerman has been actively promoting Tor
through his Global Voices network. So have other advocates of online free
speech in Asia, China, and Africa. And these efforts have been working. Wendy
Seltzer, who teaches Internet law at American University and founded Chilling
Effects, a project to combat legal threats against Internet users, saw that
firsthand when she traveled to Guangzhou, China, for a blogger conference
last year. China is generally acknowledged as the most sophisticated Internet
filterer in the world; it employs a variety of techniques, including blocking
IP addresses, domain names (the text name of a website, such as
 and even Web pages containing certain keywords (Falun Gong,
for example). According to one report, Chinese security forces have arrested
several hundred Internet users and bloggers in the past 10 years. Seltzer
says that many bloggers she met in Guangzhou were using Tor. And when she
went to an Internet caf? there, she reports, the computers were automatically
configured to run the software.
In China, Tor is one weapon in wo years ago, Turkey piled on, with particular
zeal for stamping out criticism of the nation's founding father, Kemal
Tor is preparing for the fight against relay blocking by creating a system of
"bridge nodes"--a constantly changing list of IP addresses through which
people can reach the main network of relays. A user can simply send an e-mail
asking for a bridge address. Of course, an Iranian censor could also request
and block such addresses, but the idea is to defeat such efforts by
generating ever more bridges, donated by a wide range of Internet users. And
Jonathan Zittrain, a Berkman cofounder and Harvard Law School professor,
envisions going even further. "The next big moment that the Tor people
haven't implemented--something in the background, something that would be
huge--would be if your use of Tor, by default, makes you a Tor node
yourself," he says. "At that point, it totally scales. The more people use
it, the more people can use it."
As part of a three-year effort to improve the software and expand its use,
Tor's staff and volunteers will step up appeals for Tor users to let their
computers serve as bridges to individual users elsewhere. But taking the next
step--becoming a relay, or node, potentially available to any Tor
traffic--would massively increase the traffic flowing through a user's
computer. If users became nodes by default, it could defeat the purpose of
using Tor to remain low key: once a user wandered into a cybercaf? to blog
anonymously, that terminal would soon stand out as a hub of Internet traffic.
What's more, such a system "sets off an arms race with all the network
providers and network administrators," says Andrew ?Lewman, Tor's executive
director. "It increases traffic, and we become something they might block,
because that's their job." Tor would ultimately like to find safe ways to
enlist distributed help, but for now, developers are pursuing intermediate
goals, such as limiting bulk data transfers and improving the flow among
existing Tor relays.
One criticism leveled against Tor is that ior good purposes but for
bad--protecting distributors of child pornography, for example. Dingledine's
response is that Tor's protections help law enforcement catch criminals, too,
while criminals may find it more effective to use neighbors' or public Wi-Fi
links, or hacked computers, to mask their identities.
Another concern is that circumvention tools--especially those that only use a
single proxy, which holds information about who is talking to whom--can
create privacy and security worries of their own. Earlier this year, Hal
Roberts discovered that certain tools used widely in China--DynaWeb Freegate,
GPass, and FirePhoenix--appeared to be offering to sell users' browsing
histories. While there's no evidence that any individual's privacy was
compromised, the point was made: in many cases, using anonymity or
circumvention systems still means trusting an organization with your
information--and trusting that its privacy policies can and will be honored.
(With Tor, it's a bit different; since no single relay ever holds the
information about the complete route, you must trust the integrity of
algorithms that obscure connections between origins and destinations.) "I
don't doubt the dedication of the people hosting these tools, but what I'm
concerned about is whether they will protect your data," Roberts says. "The
biggest takeaway is: they have that data."
Dingledine thinks events will push people to seek the protections that Tor
and other tools provide. In 2006, for example, AOL gave away millions of
users' search terms for research purposes. Although the searchers were
identified only by random numbers, bloggers and reporters were quickly able
to identify individual users from clues based on the search terms. (Since Tor
uses a different router pathway for each user each time, it's impossible to
amass such aggregate data about even an anonymously identified Tor user.)
Dingledine reasons that each time a national censor blocks news sites and
YouTube, or an ISP or website loses or sells or gives away user data, people
will seek solutions. "The approach we've taken so far is to let the bad guys
teach people about it," he says. "Let the AOLs and the China firewalls screw
up. Let everybody read about why they want privacy on the Internet." More and
more people might just decide that enough is enough.

Two cases of complaints (petty online fraud), with the local cop acting as a proxy

One case was a fax from BKA accusing me in trafficking
in pedophilia. I decided that I don't really want to have my family deal with a search warrant in the wee hours, and switched to middleman.
No complaints so far.

What's the situation with guerilla WLAN (long-distance and mesh), packet radio, satellite phones, illegal fiber laid across country

I don't know who "they" are, but the only way to cook up a bunch
of throwaway Tor nodes and distribute them for creative installation
is someone who has the spare cash to buy a few hundred to thousand
pieces of hardware, and give them away. In the case of Sheeva, that's
some 10 kUSD for a 1000 units (probably less due to mass rebate).
I don't have such money, but since it was my idea, and Ubuntu already
supports the Sheeva I'm willing to plug an USB drive and set up a self
hosting environment to build a Tor package or a system image based on
Ubuntu if someone sends me a Sheevaplug.
However, it would be probably trivial to do that for a seasoned Tor
developer, and it's also an issue of trust. Would you accept system
images from random strangers?
That is an excellent idea.

That's not a bug, it's a feature.
The free, uncesored Intenet is dead. The sooner we acknowledge this,
and realize that we need an anonymizing publishing layer on top of
that the better. I keep harping about that since early 1990s. Surisingly
little has happened since.
Things are never quite black and white. There is a network that is
censored and sniffed but also accountable, and hence less prone to abuse. On top of that you can have a network that anonymous/pseudonymous,
unaccountable, and slightly abusive.
There's a place for both of them to exist.

It is more useful as seeing it as two unrelated networks. That
one is implemented as a virtual layer on top of another isn't
that relevant.
The point is that you can use two (or more, such as
you can use IPv4 and IPv6 on dual-stack setups, and VPNs) networks simultaneously.
If you want to see it in such stark terms, yes. However, it's still
perfectly possible to access and publish information uncensored.
Our task should be to remove the friction, to make it easier for
So far, operating anonymizing networks like Tor isn't illegal in
most locations, yet. Where it is illegal (frequently, by use of
unconstituional laws, which makes it high treason, and explicitly
allowing armed resistance if everything else fails in some constitutions,
like e.g. the German Grundgesetz), it is of course morally permissible
to use guerilla tactics.
A simple solution for that case would be to use a self-propagating Tor worm, which infects systems, causes a fraction of them to become middleman and
others exits. Such a system would be self-propagating, and trying
to shut the nodes down would resemble a game of whack-a-mole. In totalitarian countries, where means of publishing (such as xerox
machines) were outlawed a small fraction was still capable obtaining
censored information.
Resistance in face of state threats isn't for the weak of heart.
If anonymous access is made illegal I don't expect more than 1-5%
of the population of using it.

Social sites dent privacy efforts
Greater use of social sites makes it harder to hide
Greater use of social network sites is making it harder to maintain true
anonymity, suggests research.
By analysing links between users of social sites, researchers were able to
identify many people in supposedly anonymous data sets.
The anonymised data is produced by social sites who sell it to marketing
firms to generate cash.
The results suggest web firms should do more to protect users' privacy, said
the researchers.
Circle of friends
Computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Dr Vitaly Shmatikov, from the
University of Texas at Austin, developed the algorithm which turned the
anonymous data back into names and addresses.
The data sets are usually stripped of personally identifiable information,
such as names, before it is sold to marketing companies or researchers keen
to plumb it for useful information.
Before now, it was thought sufficient to remove this data to make sure that
the true identities of subjects could not be reconstructed.
The algorithm developed by the pair looks at relationships between all the
members of a social network - not just the immediate friends that members of
these sites connect to.
Social graphs from Twitter, Flickr and Live Journal were used in the
The pair found that one third of those who are on both Flickr and Twitter can
be identified from the completely anonymous Twitter graph. This is despite
the fact that the overlap of members between the two services is thought to
be about 15%.
The researchers suggest that as social network sites become more heavily
used, then people will find it increasingly difficult to maintain a veil of
The results also had implications for the social sites themselves, wrote the
"Social-network operators should stop relying on anonymisation as the 'get
out of jail' card, insofar as user privacy is concerned," they said.
"They should inform users when their information is disclosed to third
parties, even if this information has been anonymised, and give them the
opportunity to opt out," they added.
Writing about their work, the two researchers said many different
organisations might be interested in reconstructing the true identities.
They suggest that the information might be useful to governments interested
in large scale monitoring or unscrupulous marketing firms keen to reach
certain individuals. Even phishing gangs might be interested, they speculate,
to make their messages look more convincing.
The pair will present a paper about their work to the IEEE Symposium on
Security and Privacy taking place in California from 17-20 May.

There is every incentive to make people compete for being the top 10
or even top 100 node. I know I've been checking how well my node does.
The fiber runs are inching ever closer to the network periphery (crummy
topology, should be a residential-scale mesh). The smarter companies are
laying ducts, which can be filled up with fiber (state of the art
progresses fast) after the fact.
Right now I can see a 10/50 MBit/s VDSL DSLAM box (wherein GBit Ethernet fiber(s) terminates) some 50-70 m outside my window. Elsewhere 100 MBit/s
or GBit/s fiber to the home is being rolled out, and that's symmetric
bandwidth. I think we'll see the network getting a lot speedier as
the residential broadband improves.

It might well that it is gibberish, but the concept itself
is sound. You can route simply (using only local knowledge) in dense node assemblies (both 2d and 3d) where link density decays with distance, especially if link latency is a good measure of distance, which is especially true for very large networks and/or for line of sight and/or relativistic cut-through.

Orbot: An Anonymous Proxy for Android using Tor
Posted in Announcing..., Emerging Tech, Guardian, Mobile Mobile - Comments -
October 22, 2009
Tags: android, guardianphone, proxies, tor
I?d like to make this post without much fanfare. Just looking to share
information on the work I?ve been doing with the fantastically radical team
over at the Tor Project, as part of my work on the Guardian Project. We have
successfully ported the native C Tor app to Android and built an Android
application bundle that installs, runs and provides the glue needed to make
it useful to end users?. secure, anonymous access to the web via Tor on
Android is now a reality. (Update: Tor doesn?t magically encrypt all of your
Internet activities, though. You should understand what Tor does and does not
do for you.)
However, there is still much work to be done? read on!
1) Tor 0.2.2.5-alpha release contains all the necessary code for building the
Tor binary exe using the Android C SDK. I utilized
 toolchain wrapper scripts to make
life easier. This will produce the output Tor exe that can run on Android w/o
needing root.
Update: Thanks to Jake, you can now read the updated Orbot BUILD doc for the
step by step build how to.
(thanks to ioerror for the pic)
At this point, we are pretty convinced that the performance and efficiency of
the C binary is quite significantly better than the Java-based ports of Tor
running within Dalvik? this translate to a better experience for the user,
with no noticeable increase in battery drain or lag on the rest of the device
while Tor is running in the background.
2) Orbot ? this is the new Android app which bundles the Tor binary, handles
its proper installation on the device and then provides a gui for
starting/stopping, view the log and torrc, etc. It also provides a built-in
HTTP Proxy and is licensed under the Tor license.
Just to be clear ? we aren?t using the NDK or a shared library? we are
actually extracting a binary and managing it via Runtime.getRuntime().exec()
calls. This is 100% supported ? who knew?! More info on how to do this here
The first code is up here? all is working, but def needs much polish:
This post is in part a call for developers to contribute to the continued
development of Orbot, so we can get it to a 1.0 state. The other big task is
to modify the open-source, privacy focused Shadow browser, from the
University of Cambridge DTG group, in order to make it work with our HTTP
proxy. That would be a really great step forward, as right now, we have to
ask users to set their global APN (read:
Thanks for everyone?s help and support to get here. I?d like to keep pushing
on to a public release via the App Market very soon. Let me know if you?d
like to contribute in any way ? code, screen designs, icons, testing?.

In any case people who don't want to have a 300 W PC running all the

can spend some money (1000 USD buys you >10 nodes, 10 kUSD >>100 nodes)
to be distributed to volunteers free of charge who must promise to run
Tor nodes (or at least middle-men) for a couple years.

even there you can't just fish for content as it was cleartext.

I can see large boxes for e.g. offline DES (perhaps even 3DES) cracks, but everything else is probably not cost effective (of course, NSA has demonstrably been decades ahead of open research in some instances, so don't blame me if they waterboard you just because you took this at face value).
What I really dread is having to sanitize my entire systems, which
effectively means wiping and bootstrapping my entire infrastructure from known good state, establish physical security, secret management
including crypto hardware, system hardening, privilege separation, intrusion detection and documentation, periodic review, and the like.

Most decent operating systems these days come bundled with
virtualization solutions, from heavy-weight (Xen, KVM) to lightweight (containers, OpenVZ, VServer). What is needed
is packaging the browser/proxy/Tor into such guests, leaving
only the I/O to the host. It would be probably also good if
one reverts to a clean/known good snapshot after each new start,
and/or comes bundled with IDS.
Such guests should come as appliances, or at least be easy
enough to instantiate with a script, or a few commands.
It would be still possible to compromise the host, but it would
be much harder, and perhaps require manual intervention, making
compromise slower, and easier to detect.

Why you need balls of steel to operate a Tor exit node
By calumog
I became interested in Tor in the spring of 2007 after reading about the
situation in Burma and felt that I would like to do something, anything, to
help. As a geek and lover of the internet it seemed the best thing I could do
was to run Tor as an exit node to allow those under jurisdictions that censor
the  internet free access to the information they need. I had a lot of unused
bandwidth and it seemed like a philanthropic use of it to donate that to Tor.
Tor is a system of anonymizing proxy servers which allows you to visit
resources on the web, not just web sites, without revealing your ip address.
This is extremely useful for those who are compromised in their access to the
internet because it means, rather than attempting to connect directly to the
resource in question, say Wikipedia, which might be filtered by their
government, they connect to a Tor relay which ultimately routes the request
to the resource in question via an exit node. Exit nodes are special kinds of
relays which proffer the request on behalf of the original client revealing
their ip address, not that of the original requestor, to the destination
resource. I sometimes imagine how exciting it must be for soemone in Burma,
say, or China, to load up Tor and browse to a web site they have never been
able to see before. And to know that there is nothing, nothing, that reveals
who it really is who is visiting.
I totally believe in Tor. I think it is a magnificent force for the
circumvention of internet censorship but there is a problem.  I was visited
by the police in November 2008 because my ip address had turned up in the
server logs of a site offering, or perhaps trading in (I was not told the
details of the offence) indecent images of children. The date of the offence
was about one month after I started the server so it looks as though the site
in question had been under surveillance for more than a year.  It was what is
known as a ?dawn raid? and, amazingly enough, my children were still asleep
when it occured. Thank God.  I explained to the officers, who we had heard
threatening to break the door down before we let them in, about Tor but they
had never heard of it. My wife says she thinks they were about to arrest me
before that. I was not arrested. I was told not to touch the computer and it
was placed, considerately, in a black plastic bag and taken away for forensic
examination.  I was OK at first. I knew that somebody had gone through my
server to access that material and that I was not guilty of any offence but
as the weeks wore on it started to get to me.
I was overwhelmed by horror to be implicated in such a thing. I was
desperately worried about my family. One of the officers had told my wife
that Social Services would be informed as a matter of course and there was a
possibility that my children would be taken into care.  The low point came
about two weeks after the visit by the police when I totalled my car. I was
distracted, stressed and unable to accurately assess the road conditions. I
ploughed into a hedgerow at speed, destroying the car which we had just
bought,  but, luckily, walked out of it with only bruised ribs.  I didn?t
have the money to hire a lawyer so I just sat the thing out. From time to
time the police called with an estimate of when the investigation would be
finished but none of that meant very much because those dates came and passed
with no resolution.
Eventually, four months after the visit, I picked up a voice message from the
police inviting me to call back. When I called  I was told that no evidence
had been retrieved and the machine would be returned to me.  I think, in
retrospect, I was desperately naive to run a Tor exit server on a home
computer but I didn?t believe that an ip address in a server log would be
enough evidence to warrant seizing equipment.  My wife, God bless her, was
absolutely marvellous throughout the whole thing and never doubted me.  I
have read with interest about the need to make Tor faster and that that
largely depends on having more nodes but there is no way I can contemplate
offering my ip address as a service to internet anonymity any more.  It was
very frightening for me to be implicated in a serious crime.  As a parent of
very young children I have an extensive network of friends and contacts in my

@_subject: Tor for Android 
TorProxy and Shadow
Summer placement project, written by Connell Gauld.
TorProxy is an Android application that makes it possible to use Internet sites and services anonymously from a mobile device. This is possible thanks to the Tor network and OnionCoffee. TorProxy can be used by many different Android applications to obtain an anonymous Internet application. For example, if you want to browse website anonymously you will need to install a web browser which uses TorProxy such as Shadow (see below).
Shadow is an Android application allows you to browse the Web anonymously from your mobile phone. The Shadow browser requires TorProxy (see above) do do this. In addition to using the Tor network to anonymously retrieve information from the Web, Shadow also helps you manage any "cookies" sent to Shadow by Websites to protect your browsing history.
The source code of TorProxy and Shadow are available under the GPL v2 license. Please email us for further details. We hope to provide public access to our SVN repository shortly.
How to use TorProxy and Shadow
   1. Install TorProxy and Shadow by downloading them from the Android Marketplace.
   2. Start the TorProxy application.
   3. Select a profile for TorProxy:
          * off ? do not connect to the tor network.
          * on-demand ? only connect to the tor network if a program (e.g. Shadow) needs it. This profile is probably the best choice if you only want to make occassional use of an anonymous Internet connection.
          * always on ? maintain an anonymous connection whenever the phone is actively in use.
   4. Once a connection to the Tor network is requested, a notification of the state of the connection appears in the notification bar. A countdown will appear with an estimate of the time remaining before an anonymous connection becomes available. This will take approximately one minute in the first instance, and around 35 seconds when reconnecting after the phone has woken up from a sleep state.
   5. To browse the Web, start the Shadow web browser. Shadow works in a very similar way to the normal Android Web browser. The Menu button reveals the usual browser options. Typing in a URL will initiate an anonymous connection over the Internet via Tor.
Frequently asked questions
Why is the Google Website frequently displayed in a foreign language?
Google determines the language you want from the internet address of your device. When browsing anonymously, the Tor network may provide an internet address from another country. You can click on the "Google.com in English" link to see the website in English.

1. TorProxyLib
This library contains everything you need to allow your application to anonymize its sockets.
Add TorProxyLib.jar to your build path.
2. Connect to the TorProxy control service
The TorProxy service exports an interface which you can use to check the availability of the anonymous connection and register your desire to use it.
private ITorProxyControl mControlService = null;
private final IntentFilter torStatusFilter = new IntentFilter(
                TorProxyLib.STATUS_CHANGE_INTENT);
private ServiceConnection mSvcConn = new ServiceConnection() {
                public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder service) {
                mControlService = ITorProxyControl.Stub.asInterface(service);
                // Connected to Control Service
                // Perhaps check Tor status here
        }
                public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) {
                mControlService = null;
                // Connection to Control Service lost
        }
protected void onResume() {
        // ...
        // Register to receive Tor status update broadcasts
        registerReceiver(mBroadcastReceiver, torStatusFilter);
        // Bind to the TorProxy control service
        bindService(new Intent().setComponent(new ComponentName(
                        TorProxyLib.CONTROL_SERVICE_PACKAGE,
                        TorProxyLib.CONTROL_SERVICE_CLASS)), mSvcConn, BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
        // ...
protected void onPause() {
        // ...
        // Registered in onResume so unregister here
        unregisterReceiver(mBroadcastReceiver);
        unbindService(mSvcConn);
        // ...
private BroadcastReceiver mBroadcastReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
                public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
                if (TorProxyLib.STATUS_CHANGE_INTENT.equals(intent.getAction())) {
                        // TorProxy has broadcast a Tor status update
                        // Check Tor status here
                }
        }
Using the control service
The control service has a current profile. The anonymous data connection has a current state.
The profiles are:
    * PROFILE_OFF - the anonymous data connection is turned off
    * PROFILE_ONDEMAND - you may have to register your interest to get an anonymous connection
    * PROFILE_ON - the anonymous data connection will be made available (automatically) if possible The states are:
    * STATUS_UNAVAILABLE - the anonymous data connection is currently unavailable
    * STATUS_REQUIRES_DEMAND - the anonymous data connection is currently off but may be available if you register your demand
    * STATUS_CONNECTING - the anonymous data connection is being set up
    * STATUS_ON - the anonymous data connection is available for use You can get the current profile using:
You can get the current status using:
Tunneling a socket through SocksProxy
int proxyPort = mControlService.getSOCKSPort();
SocksProxy proxy = new SocksProxy(proxyPort);
Socket s = proxy.connectSocksProxy(null, destHost, destPort, 0);

DuckDuckGo now operates a Tor exit enclave
By Gabriel Weinberg on August 13, 2010 9:30 AM  Tor enables Internet anonymity by routing your traffic through a series of
encrypted relays.
DuckDuckGo now operates one of these relays, and more importantly an exit
enclave for DDG search engine traffic. That means if you're on Tor, and you access DDG, you'll likely exit through
our relay and get service much faster. Tor can be slow, but this should speed
it up a bit (when using DuckDuckGo).
I believe this fits right in line with our privacy policy. Using Tor and DDG,
you can now be end to end anonymous with your searching. And if you use our
encrypted homepage, you can be end to end encrypted as well.
Thanks to James Toy for the idea and for helping to make it happen.
I should point out that people are often scared of operating Tor relays due
to potential abuse issues. Those issues scared me off too, at first. But with
this exit enclave setup, there are no abuse issues. Only DDG traffic exits
from our relay.
Even if you have only 20KB of bandwidth to spare, you can set up a bridge
relay that just routes traffic between nodes and never lets anyone out
through your relay. That helps the cause, and it is really easy to set up.
You can limit bandwidth to just the amount you want to give. Check out the

Home Internet with Anonymity Built In
A router that runs the Tor software prevents Web tracking.
By Tom Simonite
Many political activists, nonprofits, and businesses use an anonymity system
called Tor to encrypt and obscure what they do on the Internet. Now the
U.S.-based nonprofit that distributes Tor is developing a low-cost home
router with the same privacy protection built in.
The Tor software masks Web traffic by encrypting network messages and passing
them through a series of relays (each Tor client can also become a relay for
other users' messages). But using Tor has typically meant installing the
software on a computer and then tweaking its operating system to ensure that
all traffic is routed correctly through the program.
"We want to make anonymity something that can happen everywhere, all the
time," says Jacob Appelbaum, a Tor project developer. "When you are connected
to a router with Tor inside, all your traffic goes through Tor without you
changing your system at all. It makes it simple to use."
Appelbaum says volunteers are already testing a small number of modified
routers with Tor installed. The prototypes were made by installing new
software onto a popular low-cost wireless router made by Buffalo Technology.
The software was developed by Appelbaum and colleagues at Tor and is based on
the work of the OpenWrt project, which offers open source code for networking
equipment. The finished routers can be configured to pass all traffic through
Tor, or only some kinds of communications. "You might want to run your VOIP
device through Tor but not your other traffic," Appelbaum explains. They will
also be capable of simultaneously offering Tor-protected and conventional
wireless networks.
"If we find that these routers are useful [in the trials]," he says, "we
could partner with OpenWrt and Buffalo to offer a version for sale that helps
support the Tor and OpenWrt projects." The software will also be made
available for people to install on routers they have bought themselves,
Appelbaum says.
Besides serving as Tor clients, the new routers will help anonymize the
traffic of other Tor users. This means that they could help boost the
performance the Tor network.
When a person uses Tor to bring up a Web page, the request is encrypted and
sent along a random path through other Tor computers that act as relays. This
obscures the originating IP (Internet protocol) address?a unique code that
can be used to track down a Web user, to filter access to certain sites or
services, or to build up a profile of a person's Web use.
Generally, the process results in lag and restricts bandwidth, which deters
some people from using Tor, says Chris Palmer, technology director at the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. "The primary way to address that problem is
to have more Tor relays in more places, connected to high-bandwidth,
low-latency lines," he explains. "Wireless routers may fit the bill well, if
they can be built with the computational resources necessary to run a Tor
relay of decent capacity." Although consumer-grade routers are necessarily
relatively low-powered, their capabilities have grown markedly in recent
years, Palmer notes.
Tor routers could also make the entire Tor system better able to resist
government attempts to block its use. An individual installation of Tor
software hooks into the network by referring to a list of relays in a
directory maintained by the Tor project. It is possible to block Tor by
checking the same directory and preventing connections to the servers
listed?a tactic apparently used by the Chinese authorities. It is possible to
get around such a block, however, by configuring the Tor software to act as a
"bridge," or a private relay, that can only be discovered by word of mouth. A
Tor router can also act as a bridge, and Appelbaum is considering making that
a default setting.
During the protests in Iran that followed the 2009 election, the EFF
campaigned for more people to act as Tor bridges to keep the government from
blocking the tool, and Palmer says increasing the supply of bridges remains
important. "It makes the adversary's job more difficult when there are more
possible bridges to advertise and use," he says.
Appelbaum says, "If you have 10,000 people using these little routers, then
China would have a lot more difficulty blocking Tor."

Flaws in Tor anonymity network spotlighted
By John Borland, wired.com | Last updated about 4 hours ago
At the Chaos Computer Club Congress in Berlin, Germany on Monday, researchers
from the University of Regensburg delivered a new warning about the Tor
anonymizer network, a system aimed at hiding details of a computer user?s
online activity from spying eyes.
The attack doesn?t quite make a surfer?s activity an open book, but offers
the ability for someone on the same local network?a Wi-Fi network provider,
or an ISP working at law enforcement (or a regime?s) request, for example?to
gain a potentially good idea of sites an anonymous surfer is viewing.
?Developers have to be aware of this kind of attack, and develop
countermeasures,? said Dominik Herrmann, a Regensburg PhD student studying
profiling and fingerprinting attacks. ?But that proves to be very difficult.?
The research, performed by a variety of collaborators in Germany working on
anonymity measures, represents a warning for privacy-conscious users wary of
spying eyes, whether behind Net-unfriendly borders or simply corporate
Tor is essentially an online mask, rather than a tool that hides the fact or
content of communication itself. The project?s developers are addressing the
problem of traffic analysis?essentially the threat that an attacker or
observer might be able to tease out a person?s identity, location,
profession, social network or other information about the message content by
analyzing a message?s unencrypted headers.
To hide this information, the Tor system routes messages around a winding
path of volunteer servers across the Net, with each relay point knowing only
the address of the previous and next step in the pathway.
Once this circuit has been established, neither an eavesdropper nor a
compromised relay will theoretically have the ability to determine both the
source and destination of a given piece of communication. According to the
Tor project?s latest metrics, the network has drawn between 100,000 and
300,000 users per day over the last several months.
Herrmann and his fellow researchers say there?s a partial flaw in this
arrangement, however. A potential eavesdropper on the end user?s own network
still has the ability to analyze the patterns of data being returned, and in
many cases will be able to develop a reasonable guess about the source of the
An attacker?perhaps an ISP instructed by law enforcement or a government to
engage in such surveillance?would first have to develop a list of potential
sites that the target might be visiting, or that it was interested in
monitoring. It would then run the Tor system itself, testing the way these
sites appeared when accessed through Tor, developing a database of
?fingerprints? associated with the sites of interest.
Once the target of the surveillance went online, the eavesdropper would
capture the packet stream as it crossed the local network and compare the
source data with its fingerprint database with the help of pattern
recognition software. Any match would be only statistical, giving somewhere
between 55 percent and 60 percent certainty, Herrmann said?not enough to
provide hard evidence in court, but likely more certainty than many people
seeking privacy might be comfortable with.
Different online destinations will carry different susceptibility to
fingerprinting, of course. Unusual sites, with characteristics such as very
heavy or large graphic use, can be more easily identified, Herrmann said. By
the same token, the easiest way for a website to fool such an eavesdropper
would be to make its site look as closely as possible like another popular
site?mimicking the look of the Google site, for example, one of the most
commonly accessed pages on the Web.
Users themselves can guard against this type of fingerprint-based
eavesdropping relatively easily, Herrmann noted. Downloading or requesting
more than one site at a time through the network will muddy the pattern
enough that certainty will be very difficult for the eavesdropper to
The research many not dissuade many from using Tor, which remains one of the
most promising approaches for individuals seeking to hide aspects of their
identity or online activity. But it may well make them work harder.

I'm thinking about high-latency (suitable for nonrealtime things
like leaking and email/messaging) anonymity-enhanced versions of Tor.
Delays from hours to days are tolerable here, provided the result
is reliable. It would obviously have to be run as a private Tor network, though
perhaps with gateways to Tor and other networks. A fraction
of total nodes should be unlisted bridge relays. It would probably
profit from a botnet-like approach, especially if global scrutiny
increases. It should default to a much larger number of hops, introduce random delays and chaffing. Each node should come with a hidden service to Tahoe-LAFS or similar. A version should come as a convenient and containable virtual appliance, or packaged as plug computers.
Comments, other suggestions?

Tor as is wasn't designed to resist TLA-level adversaries (which
have no issues instrumenting each Tor node upstream with realtime
network probes, and dedicate enough resouces for traffic analysis).
Relaxing the realtime constraint, adding random delays, more hops and also chaff trafic in a Tor derivate would arguably make such attacks more difficult. Of course such a derivate would not play nice with the
existing Tor network, and should be run as a separate
entity. Due to limited carrying capacity such a network
would be probably more vulnerable to denial of service
attacks (flooding traffic from within).

You would have to run attacks against simulated networks in order
to optimize for parameters like random delay distribution, amount
of chaff injected, and number of hops. This is definitely a nontrivial
problem, and I'm definitely not the person to answer this.

Libert? Linux is a secure, reliable, lightweight, and easy to use
Gentoo-based LiveUSB Linux distribution intended as a communication aid in
hostile environments. Libert? installs as a regular directory on a USB/SD
key, and after a single-click setup, boots on any desktop computer or laptop.
Available internet connection is then used to set up a Tor circuit which
handles all network communication. During first boot, a unique email ID is
generated from fingerprints of user's certificate and Tor hidden service key.
This persistent ID allows one to stealthily communicate with other Libert?
users (the communication part is not yet finished). The distribution includes
image and document processing applications, and can function as a secure web
browsing platform.
For developers, Libert? can also serve as a robust framework for mastering
Gentoo-based LiveUSBs/CDs. The build process is fully automated with
incremental build support, and is more mature and reliable than most of
Gentoo's own outdated LiveCD tools. Gentoo is an extremely flexible
distribution for safely generating custom live media from source ? for

Project scope
Libert? Linux is not a generic live Linux distribution with anonymity
features. For that purpose, you are better off installing the relevant
software on an off-the-shelf operating system (regular or live), or using one
of the live distributions that come pre-installed with anonymity software,
such as The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System.
The primary focus of Libert? is to let you communicate, stealthily and
securely, with other people in a hostile environment. Here, hostile
environment is one where someone is out to get you because of something you
do. Therefore, as security inevitably comes at a price of usability, and
assuming that you are a typical Tor (or Freenet, I2P, ...) user, Libert?
Linux is not for you.
[trollface] Why? Let's consider the (realistic) possibilities. A likely one
is that you are a clueless spoiled American adolescent (or a European
equivalent of one) with liberal views, believing that it is vital to prevent
the government from snooping on his political views, as expressed in various
circle-jerk online forums. Another possibility is that you are an adult
American neocon nutjob who likes to buy guns and memorize their technical
specifications, and frequently masturbates to the absurd idea that it will be
a rabble of people like him, and not the military elite, who might one day
overthrow the evil centralized government. Yet another possibility is that
you simply like to view nude pictures of little kids?which, depending on your
jurisdiction and the hypocritic prurience of your surroundings, might as well
include 20-year-old nubile females.
In none of the cases above (or a combination thereof), is anyone really out
to get you. You are simply not significant. (Sure, the party van might still
show up at your front door in the last case, but you weren't really
communicating with anyone in the first place.) Same goes for privacy freaks,
etc., etc.?yes, Google keeps your search history forever, but it's only to
enhance its capability of shoving advertisements down your throat, nothing
personal. [/trollface]
Now, if you are still reading, you might as well be more unique. A dissident
in Iran, perhaps, or an anti-government cell coordinator in China. A
highly-ranked mole in the US intelligence service, passing information to his
handler in the Belarusian embassy. Or, a whistle-blower in an international
petroleum corporation. All these accounts have something in common: high
technological capacity of the authority in place, and willingness to use this
capacity to find out who you are in order to stop you.

Bitcoin And The Electronic Frontier Foundation
There are many legal implications when utilizing Bitcoin. Users of Bitcoin
who conduct business with the wrong people could face charges of money
laundering, identity theft, and/or fraud. Honest Bitcoin users could be
implicated in crimes by criminals engaging in phishing or malware and
stealing identities. The Bitcoin economy resembles that of the wild, wild,
west with inherently little or no regulation. Because of the barbaric nature
of this new currency it is highly susceptible to legal attacks by law
enforcement. Bitcoin has recently, however, gained some legal protection by
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In another significant milestone
for P2P cryptocurrency the EFF has agreed to accept Bitcoin donations! The
EFF is known for legal cases involving high profile tech companies such as
Apple, Google, Craigslist, and Facebook. The simple fact that the EFF is
welcoming anonymous donations is a small but significant step towards Bitcoin
societal acceptance.
Accepting anonymous donations is not a light decision by the EFF, and the
implications are monumental. For example, selling or buying Bitcoins with an
anonymous user could mean unintentionally aiding terrorism or helping North
Korea build nuclear weapons. Or, political groups accepting Bitcoins could be
accepting funds by enemies of the state. The United States recently placed
sanctions on Iran for its nuclear programs, and if Bitcoins are adopted
universally then sanctions would no longer work as a tool to change the
behaviors of government. In essence, the globalization of Bitcoins will
affect international political policy.
The disruptive nature of Bitcoin can cause unease with existing institutions
and the war against Bitcoin will be waged through a legal front. The
endorsement of the EFF could set up a legal battle in the future, "Bitcoin
vs. Entity X". What courts could fail to realize, however, is the
non-centralized aspect of Bitcoin, which makes shutting down the service next
to impossible. Most likely, that is why Bitcoin will succeed no matter what
trials and tribulations it may have to face. Nevertheless, the EFF's
willingness to accept Bitcoins will further the cryptocurrency's cause, and
will encourage the recognition of Bitcoin as a currency to be "official".
Several members of bitcoin.org have been involved in making the endorsement
of the EFF happen which you can read at this forum thread. Feel free to
donate to the EFF at their donation page. To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

Tor experiments with IPv6
With the alpha version 0.2.3.9 of Tor, the anonymity software, Tor clients
can now connect to private bridges using IPv6. According to the announcement
on the Tor blog, when using IPv6, bridges still need at least one IPv4
address, as they would otherwise lose contact with other nodes in the Tor
network. On the Tor Developer mailing list, Linus Nordberg describes how to
set the necessary options on a Tor bridge for IPv6 operation.
In addition, the Tor developers have created the "DisableNetwork"
configuration option and a "tor2web" mode which enables clients to connect to
hidden services without anonymity and is likely to improve connection
performance; however, to avoid possible mistakes, the latter feature can only
be turned on at compile time. With "DisableNetwork" turned on, Tor is
prevented from launching or accepting any connections other than on a control
port. This feature can also be used by software such as Orbot (the Tor
implementation for Android) as a means of saving power. Further details about
the new features can be found on the Tor blog and the Developer Forum. Source
code for Tor is available to download under the terms of the BSD licence.

There are excellent reasons to run it in a VM, because it prevents
the leaks by forcing all traffic through one interface.
It is very convenient, while rebooting systems or having
dedicated systems with no clipboard access is not.
I predict Tails run as VM will be far often than on
bare iron.
Security and usability are inversely related. Unusable
systems don't get used.
It warns the user, which is the right thing to do -- your host

Iran cracks down on web dissident technology
Iranian security authorities have launched a new crackdown on dissidents
online by blocking US government-backed technology that allows them to speak
out safely.
Tor took off in Iran after the disputed 2009 election Photo: AFP/GETTY
By Christopher Williams, Technology Correspondent 7:00AM GMT 18 Mar 2011
Internet freedom activists believe the regime in Tehran has implemented
highly sophisticated internet surveillance technology and that an information
?arms race? is now inevitable.
The crackdown targeted Tor, a free piece of software that allows anyone to
connect to internet via a global private network that hides computer IP
addresses, which could be used by authorities to identify and locate
dissidents. It also encrypts the contents of users' internet communications,
making eavesdropping on emails, Facebook, Twitter and other applications more
On average, around 250,000 computers worldwide are connected to the Tor
network at any time, making it the leading anti-surveillance technology
But in mid-January, as revolutionary fervour swept the Middle East, the
number of computers connected to the Tor network via one major Iranian
broadband provider collapsed almost overnight from more than 11,000 to zero.
Investigations by the Tor Project, the not-for-profit company that runs the
system, have since revealed that, crucially, other encrypted traffic such as
internet banking was still flowing. It meant Iranian authorities had for the
first time found a way to identify and block only Tor connections, and
therefore a way to potentially identify dissidents.
?What they did was vastly upgrade their capability,? said Andrew Lewman,
executive director of the Tor Project.
The technology responsible for the new threat was Deep Packet Inspection
(DPI), a type of high-end network equipment that uses ultra-fast microchips
to read and classify internet traffic in transit. The Iranian authorities
used DPI to detect the highly specific parameters Tor uses to establish an
encrypted connection.
?From an engineering perspective this is fantastic,? said Mr Lewman of his
adversaries' efforts.
He added that the Tor Project had known it could be attacked in this way ?for
years?, but had chosen not to take pre-emptive measures because ?we?re trying
to have an arms race really slowly?. In the last few weeks developers have
redesigned the software so that its traffic looks just like any other when it
sets up an encrypted connection, and Iranian user numbers are now back to
It is unknown who supplied Iran with the DPI technology, but few technology
manufacturers build equipment capable of reading and classifying internet
traffic at the necessary scale and speed. Last year, Nokia-Siemens faced a
European Parliament hearing after it admitted selling a mass communications
?monitoring centre? to an Iranian mobile network.
?Who knows, maybe they just got someone to configure it for them,? Mr Lewman
Whoever the supplier, the temporary block on Tor does show that Iran is now
more advanced than even China and its Great Firewall in terms of the
technology it uses to suppress dissent online, said Mr Lewman. The regime has
rapidly caught up with its critics since the unrest following the 2009
election, when the number of Tor users rocketed from approximately 1,200 to
2,800 in a matter of days as many Iranians first began to use social networks
to organise protests.  The value of ?internet freedom? technologies to US
foreign policy has not gone unnoticed in Washington: the Tor Project?s arms
race with Iranian authorities is funded in part by grants from both the
Department of Defense and the State Department.

Use your own servers at the co-lo. Use TPM and tamper-proof systems.
I used to store crypto secrets on USB smartcards, and have

Au contraire, it does matter very much in practice. By controlling
your hardware instead of relying on vendors or even "teh cloud" you're raising the bar for attacks considerably. Consider that nobody can know which exactly security measures you've taken.
Did you catch the part with the video, also streamed off-site?
If there's a convenient temporal lacune on multiple probes, you know your hardware is no longer trusted.
They are welcome to tap the network. It's what they already can do,
by mirroring the incoming switch port and packet capturing there.
This is not relevant to accessing secrets locked in hardware, or
present at runtime.
Because you generated the key itself, of course, and using a
physically secured TPM token you installed yourself.
It can be rather hard to access a piece of hardware hotglued into
an internal USB port, with hardware with live IPMI monitoring,
including chassis intrusion detection, including motion-detected
streaming video streaming to cryptographically secured local
filesystem and also off-site.
It is all doable, but it won't be done in practice or ordinary
threat models.

I think he missed my point: there is a wide spread in threat
scenarios and capabilities. What we care most is preventing
easy, undetectable and hence scalable information vacuuming by way of forcing cloud operators to provide convenient access APIs. This is what dominates the volume.
None such are available at the co-lo hosting own hardware or
freedom boxes on home broadband. Sure Shabak ninjas could abseil through the skylights, garotte the cat and compromise my NIC, but if I'm worried about these I shouldn't be relying on Tor, anyway.
This is not the threat model we're looking for. Move along.

That's the main idea.
If they have to dispatch a warm body to a remote physical
location my job is done already. If it has to be a warm sentient
body who has to analyze an unfamiliar situation and attempt an
undetected physical layer attack I've already succeeded wildly beyond all expectations. Sure, the Shabak will garrote your cat. Or maybe your cat is quite
safe, after all.
Have fun with your slippery slope of absurdities. Yes, there's a nuke
triggered to a dead man's switch.
Do you see the difference between Gmail or Amazon cloud rendering upon
Caesar what is his and my logless postfix running on you own hardened box,
with mail residing client-side on a crypto filesystem? Do you have the slightest idea how much that would cost, especially if
I'm not to notice?
My thinking is that I wouldn't hire you as a security consultant.
I am really illustrating a number of distinct, staged models with progressive
costs both to Alice and to Mallory. You can consider them each, one at a
time. It's not out of question. You seem to have poor reading comprehension and security analysis skills.
You do realize that you're trying to teach your grandmother to suck eggs?
Always titrate your paranoia to functional levels. If you think your
entire toolchain is compromised and Really Care(tm) then bootstrapping from scratch including synthesizing your hardware from a minimal Forth core is quite possible.
My boxes are already on an UPS. That's the whole point, or provider
can simply cut power, and simulate an outage. The point is that they
would have to physically approach the rack, at which point there will
be a triggered recording. You have no idea where the recording goes and which out of band channels it might use. If you're smart, you'll
back off when you see the LED glow. If you can see NIR, I mean.
We can play this game ten times to Sunday, and I can assure you that with a minimal amount of planning you can make the traceless
extraction of tamper-proof hosted secrets arbitrarily difficult. It's lead azide, actually. I see you've been reading my stolen design documents.
You're being out ouf your depth and not realizing it.
By not using a Gmail account or Amazon cloud you don't even have to use GPG.
If I can't see it, I know I'm compromised.
Knowing when you're under scrutiny is the second feature of the setup.
The first point is not being a sitting duck.
You should avoid mixing uppers and downers with your psychoactives.
It's really bad for your health.
See, I don't have to bother using cloud or Gmail for private purposes, either.

Bodies hanging from bridge in Mexico are warning to social media users
By Mariano Castillo, CNN
Mexico hangings a warning?
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Signs say two people were killed for denouncing cartel activities on the
Their bodies show signs of torture
Online posts have become some of the loudest voices reporting violence in
Social media users say they will stand strong
(CNN) -- Social media users who denounce drug cartel activities along the
Mexican border received a brutal warning this week: Two mangled bodies
hanging like cuts of meat from a pedestrian bridge.
A woman was hogtied and disemboweled, her intestines protruding from three
deep cuts on her abdomen. Attackers left her topless, dangling by her feet
and hands from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. A bloodied man
next to her was hanging by his hands, his right shoulder severed so deeply
the bone was visible.
Signs left near the bodies declared the pair, both apparently in their early
20s, were killed for posting denouncements of drug cartel activities on a
social network.
"This is going to happen to all of those posting funny things on the
Internet," one sign said. "You better (expletive) pay attention. I'm about to
get you."
The gruesome scene sent a chilling message at a time when online posts have
become some of the loudest voices reporting violence in Mexico. In some parts
of the country, threats from cartels have silenced traditional media.
Sometimes even local authorities fear speaking out.
Mexico's notoriously ruthless drug gangs regularly hang victims from bridges
and highway overpasses.
And bloggers who specialize in sharing news about trafficking have been
threatened in the past. But this could be the first time users of such social
networks have been targeted.
Investigator Ricardo Mancillas Castillo said he had not encountered a threat
against Internet users in his four years based in Nuevo Laredo. But the signs
of torture -- the cuts, the disembowelment -- were along the lines of what
officials are used to seeing in drug-related violence.
In the case of the two victims found on the Nuevo Laredo bridge Tuesday,
their ears and fingers were mutilated, said Mancillas, who works for the
public prosecutor's office.
There are no witnesses, and it is a nearly impossible task to identify the
perpetrators, he said.
Thirty-six hours had passed since the bodies were found Tuesday morning, but
no one had come to claim them and they remained unidentified, Mancillas said.
It will be nearly impossible to determine if the two victims actually posted
anything about cartels on the Internet, as people don't usually use their
real names online, he said.
The placards threatened those who report violent incidents through social
media networks. It listed two blogs by name, Al Rojo Vivo and Blog del Narco.
They were signed "Z," a possible reference for the Zetas cartel, which
operates in the area.
Blog del Narco is a website that deals exclusively with news related to drug
violence in Mexico. Its creator remains anonymous.
On the Al Rojo Vivo forum, where citizens can make anonymous tips, one person
 "Don't be afraid to denounce. It's very difficult for them to find out
who denounced. They only want to scare society."
One Twitter user echoed that sense of defiance in light of the threats.
"Enough! If we shut up today, we will have lost the ground that we have
gained. This is the time to show what we are made of," the owner of the
 Twitter account wrote.
In a statement sent to CNN, Blog del Narco said its site is not dedicated to
denouncing crime, as are other sites.
"In addition, we are not in favor or against any criminal group, we only
inform as things happen," the statement said.
More than 34,600 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican
President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006,
according to government statistics. Other reports have listed a higher toll.
The latest Mexican government tally was released in January.

Tor traffic disguised as Skype video calls to fool repressive governments

Tor traffic disguised as Skype video calls to fool repressive governments
An overview of the SkypeMorph architecture, which converts packet size
distributions in Tor to those in Skype video calls.
Computer scientists have released a tool that disguises communications sent
through the Tor anonymity service as Skype video calls, a cloak that's
intended to prevent repressive governments from blocking the anonymous
SkypeMorph, as the application is called, is designed to remedy a fundamental
limitation of Tor: While the communications are cryptographically secured,
unique characteristics of their individual data packets make them easy to
identify as they travel over the networks. In the past, for example, the
cryptographic key exchange was different in Tor transactions and the
certificates used were typically valid for only a matter of hours, compared
with as long as a year or two for certificates used by most Web servers.
These fingerprints made it possible for government censors in Iran, China,
and elsewhere to block data traveling over Tor while leaving the rest of the
country's communications intact.
Tor developers have remedied those shortcomings, but other unique signatures
still exist. The idea behind SkypeMorph is to camouflage Tor communications
so they blend in as traffic that government censors are reluctant to
"The goal is to make the traffic look like some other protocol that they are
not willing to block," Ian Goldberg, a professor at the Cheriton School of
Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, told Ars. "They could just
shut off the Internet, of course, like Egypt did for a few days a year or so
ago, but that, of course, would be extremely unpopular to their own people
that are wondering why can't see pictures of cute cats." A censorship arms
The release of SkypeMorph comes a few months after a separate research team
in Sweden uncovered changes the Chinese government made to its "Great
Firewall" censorship infrastructure to make it harder for citizens to use
Tor. Although their research paper (PDF) was only recently published, the
findings have been public for a few months, said Goldberg, who sits on the
Tor Project's board of directors. As censors in China and elsewhere devise
increasingly sophisticated measures of detecting and blocking the anonymity
service, it falls on Tor volunteers to find new ways to thwart them.
"The whole point of SkypeMorph is exactly because the Great Firewall is so
complex," said Goldberg, who refers to the jockeying between privacy
advocates and governments as a censorship arms race. "You have to very
convincingly pretend your traffic is something else, like Skype."
SkypeMorph relies on the Microsoft-owned VoIP service to establish a
cryptographically secured connection between an end user and unlisted entry
points, known as bridges, to the Tor network. By sending a few short Skype
messages to one of the bridges, a Tor user performs a Diffie Hellman key
exchange to make sure the connection can be trusted. Once the handoff is
completed, SkypeMorph initiates a Skype video call to the bridge and quickly
drops it. The bridge and the end user then use the key to securely
communicate using normal Tor protocols.
To prevent the Tor traffic from being recognized by anyone analyzing the
network flow, SkypeMorph uses what's known as traffic shaping to convert Tor
packets into User Datagram Protocol packets, as used by Skype. The traffic
shaping also mimics the sizes and timings of packets produced by normal Skype
video conversations. As a result, outsiders observing the traffic between the
end user and the bridge see data that looks identical to a Skype video
The SkypeMorph developers chose Skype because the software is widely used
throughout the world, making it hard for governments to block it without
arousing widespread criticism. The developers picked the VoIP client's video
functions because its flow of packets more closely resembles Tor traffic.
Voice communications, by contrast, show long pauses in transmissions, as one
party speaks and the other listens.
"It's not enough just to send encrypted packets to a particular port,
Goldberg explained. "You want to send them in patterns and sequences and
sizes and distributions that look as realistic as possible. What our system
does is go a step beyond traffic morphing and not only matches the packet
size distributions but also matches the timing distributions."
To prevent the Skype network from being overburdened, SkypeMorph sends data
directly over the Internet once the VoIP client has been used to establish a
secured connection.  Modular obfuscation plugins
The application makes use of programming interfaces built into Tor that allow
the program to work with obfuscation extensions called pluggable transports.
Such add-ons appear as SOCKS proxies to the Tor client and allow data
delivered to bridges to be sent in obfuscated ways. Developers can design
pluggable transports for Tor in much the way people write add-ons for the
Firefox or Chrome browsers.
So far, the only pluggable transport available for Tor is known as obfsproxy.
It passes traffic between end users and bridges through a stream cipher.
SkypeMorph is designed to extend the benefit of this plugin "to address its
limitation of not outputting innocuous-looking traffic," Goldberg's research
paper (PDF) describing the software said.
The SkypeMorph paper was co-authored by Hooman Mohajeri Moghaddam, Baiyu Li,
and Mohammad Derakhshani, all of whom were students enrolled in a class
taught by Goldberg titled Hot Topics in Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

How China Blocks the Tor Anonymity Network
Security analysts reveal the inner workings of China's efforts to block the
Tor anonymity network--and how to get around this censorship.
kfc 04/04/2012
The Tor Project is a free network run by volunteers that hides users'
locations and usage from surveillance and traffic analysis. Essentially, it
provides online anonymity to anybody who wants it.  Tor users can send email
and instant messages, surf websites, and post content online without anyone
knowing who or where they are. Consequently, it is widely acknowledged as an
important tool for freedom of expression. That's clearly a worry for authoritarian regimes that want to control and
limit their citizens' access to the outside world. The biggest and most
powerful of these is China, and the government there operates a firewall that
denies its citizens online access to the outside world. It's no surprise then that the Great Firewall of China, as it is called,
actively blocks access to the Tor network. So an interesting question is how
this censorship works and how it might be circumvented.
Today, Philipp Winter and Stefan Lindskog at Karlstad University in Sweden
provide an answer. These guys have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the way the Great
Firewall of China blocks Tor and how these measures might be sidestepped.
First, a bit of background about Tor. Let's imagine a fictional user called
Alice. To use the Tor network, Alice must first download the free software
package, which she runs on her computer. This software encrypts Alice's online communication and sends it to a Tor
server called an entry relay, which then directs it randomly through a
network of Tor relays operated by volunteers around the world. Anybody
receiving information from Alice can trace the message back only to the last
Tor server. Also, since the Internet address of the sender and receiver are encrypted
while they are in the network, an eavesdropper cannot tell who sent a message
or where it is going. The obvious way for China to prevent access to Tor is to block access from
inside the country to the entry relays. That's easy because the entry relays
are publicly listed, and, indeed, the Great Firewall of China does exactly
However, in anticipation of this tactic, the Tor network always operates a
number of entry relays without publishing their details. These are much
harder to block and can easily be changed.
The trouble is that the Great Firewall of China seems to have found a way to
detect and block these secret relays as well. Now Winter and Lindskog think they've worked out how this is done. The trick
has been to set up their own secret relay and to try to connect to it from
inside China (building on previous work by Tim Wilde at Team Cymru).
The Tor software that Alice runs must connect with any Tor relay it contacts
using a special handshake protocol. This protocol contains unique sequences
of code. Winter and Lindskog say the firewall uses deep pattern inspection to look for
this code in any outgoing communications. If it finds it, it assumes a
potential Tor connection. It then attempts to make its own connection. If
that works, the firewall then blocks future access to this IP address. Impressively, Winter and Lindskog have worked out the details of how the deep
packet inspection does this. Even more impressively, these guys have used Google's reverse DNS lookup
service to work out who seems to be behind this censorship. The evidence
points strongly to two of China's largest telecom companies: China Telecom
and China Unicom. Both of these organisations are government-owned and clearly well placed to
operate a firewall on this scale.
So what to do? With their newfound knowledge of how the Great Firewall of
China works, Winter and Lindskog suggest a number of strategies that Tor
users could exploit to beat it. One idea is packet fragmentation--dividing up the packets to confuse the deep
packet inspection system so that it cannot easily find and block secret
relays.  However, that relies on all Tor users using packet fragmentation. A single
Tor user who connects to a secret relay in the conventional way will give it
away, allowing the authorities to block it.
Perhaps the most promising avenue is a tool currently being developed called
Obfsproxy. This camouflages Tor traffic, making it look like something else,
such as Skype traffic, for example.
China is clearly worried about this approach. The Great Firewall of China
currently blocks all published relays designed to use Obfsproxy. However,
Winter and Lindskog set up a private Obfsproxy relay in Sweden and
successfully connected to it from inside China. "We initiated several
connections to it over several hours and could always successfully establish
a Tor circuit," they say.
That seems to prove that the deep packet inspection system cannot spot
private Obfsproxy relays and so looks like a promising route forward. The main reason the Great Firewall is able to detect Tor traffic is that it
is easily distinguishable from other types of Internet traffic. "It is
crucial that this distinguishability is minimised," conclude Winter and
There is a broader issue of course. Because Tor is an open and transparent
organisation, these kinds of discussions about how best to circumvent the
Chinese firewall inevitably take place in public, in full view of the Chinese
authorities they are attempting to outwit.
The mere publication of Winter and Lindskog's paper gives the Chinese
authorities full view of the techniques these guys have used to reveal how
the firewall works.
Security analysts and the developers behind Tor must be sorely tempted to
hide their deliberations and protect their future work behind an impenetrable
veil of secrecy. That must be resisted. These kinds of open discussion may be like fighting with one hand tied behind
your back. But surely such is the price of freedom.

Feds shutter online narcotics store that used TOR to hide its tracks
By Dan Goodin | Published April 16, 2012 4:11 PM
Federal authorities have arrested eight men accused of distributing more than
$1 million worth of LSD, ecstasy, and other narcotics with an online
storefront that used the TOR anonymity service to mask their Internet
"The Farmer's Market," as the online store was called, was like an Amazon for
consumers of controlled substances, according to a 66-page indictment
unsealed on Monday. It offered online forums, Web-based order forms, customer
service, and at least four methods of payment, including PayPal and Western
Union. From January 2007 to October 2009, it processed some 5,256 orders
valued at $1.04 million. The site catered to about 3,000 customers in 35
countries, including the United States.
To elude law enforcement officers, the operators used software provided by
the TOR Project that makes it virtually impossible to track the activities of
users' IP addresses. The alleged conspirators also used IP anonymizers and
covert currency transactions to cover their tracks. The indictment, which
cited e-mails sent among the men dating back to 2006, didn't say how
investigators managed to infiltrate the site or link it to the individuals
accused of running it.
Prosecutors said in a press release that the charges were the result of a
two-year investigation led by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration's
Los Angeles field division. "Operation Adam Bomb, " as the investigation was
dubbed, also involved law enforcement agents from several US states and
several countries, including Colombia, the Netherlands, and Scotland.
Lead defendant Marc Willem was arrested on Monday at his home in Lelystad,
Netherlands, federal prosecutors said in a press release. On Sunday,
authorities arrested Michael Evron, a US citizen who lives in Argentina as he
was attempting to leave Colombia. The remaining defendants?Jonathan Colbeck,
Brian Colbeck, Ryan Rawls, Jonathan Dugan, George Matzek, and Charles
Bigras?were arrested at their respective homes in Iowa, Michigan, Georgia,
New York, New Jersey, and Florida. Attempts to reach the men for comment
weren't immediately successful.
The 12-count indictment charges all eight men with conspiracy to distribute
controlled substances and to launder money. Several of them are also charged
with distributing LSD and taking part in a continuing criminal enterprise.
Each faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.
The arrests come about a year after Gawker documented the existence of Silk
Road, an online narcotics storefront that was available only to TOR users.
The site sold LSD, Afghani hashish, tar heroin and other controlled
substances and allowed customers to pay using the virtual currency known as
Bitcoin, the article reported. It wasn't immediately clear what the
relationship between Silk Road and Farmer's Market is.
Farmer's Market had thousands of registered users who hailed from every one
of the states of the United States and the District of Columbia, as well as
34 other countries, according to prosecutors. The site relied on multiple
sources of various controlled substances. The suppliers, operators, and
customers communicated primarily through the website's internal private
messaging system.
In addition to the eight arrests, authorities arrested seven other people on
Monday. In the course of the arrests, authorities seized hash, LSD, and MDMA,
in addition to an indoor psychotripic mushroom grow and three indoor
marijuana growing operations.  Photograph by images.cdn.fotopedia.com

This is also a misleading statement.  Explain the difference between a

traffic will be data with questionable copyright status, and
1 of of 5 or so will be a botted box doing other illegal stuff, and a

In other words, if TOR exit nodes provide a "knowingly illegal

I know I'm going to get flamed and excoriated, but here goes....
This is a misleading statement. ISP's (Common carriers) do not provide a
knowingly illegal offering, AND they do provide the PHYSICAL
infrastructure for packets to be passed and interconnected to other
PHYSICAL networks. TOR exit/entrance nodes provide only the former. The
lack of providing a physical infrastructure is crucial. Also, most ISP's
(US specifically) are required by Law (under subpoena) to provide
details to law enforcement.
I really hate this idea of privacy on the Internet. If you really think
you have the "right" to use the public infrastructure (to whatever
extent you want to label the Internet as such) and be completely
anonymous, I have a bridge to sell you. Network operators may treat your
packets to whatever level of scrutiny that they may find necessary to
determine if they want to pass your packets, keeping in mind that good
operators want the Internet to work.
I'm waiting for the next hot "application" to use a widely known "bad"
port and see what happens. :)
I'm actually in agreement that law enforcement may have overstepped here
if the only reason was the TOR exit point, but having a TOR exit point
to me, seems to be condoning the actions/statements/packets used through
the exit point. You are knowingly hiding information that your local
government may require you to disclose.
Short answer... don't use TOR. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good
thing either.

A TOR node, in and of itself, is not infrastructure for passing packets.
It's a service on the infrastructure. I never implied that the traffic

A flyer designed by the FBI and the Department of Justice to promote
suspicious activity reporting in internet cafes lists basic tools used for
online privacy as potential signs of terrorist activity.  The document, part
of a program called ?Communities Against Terrorism?, lists the use of
?anonymizers, portals, or other means to shield IP address? as a sign that a
person could be engaged in or supporting terrorist activity.  The use of
encryption is also listed as a suspicious activity along with steganography,
the practice of using ?software to hide encrypted data in digital photos? or
other media.  In fact, the flyer recommends that anyone ?overly concerned
about privacy? or attempting to ?shield the screen from view of others?
should be considered suspicious and potentially engaged in terrorist
Logging into an account associated with a residential internet service
provider (such as Comcast or AOL), an activity that could simply indicate
that you are on a trip, is also considered a suspicious activity.  Viewing
any content related to ?military tactics? including manuals or ?revolutionary
literature? is also considered a potential indicator of terrorist activity.
This would mean that viewing a number of websites, including the one you are
on right now, could be construed by a hapless employee as an highly
suspicious activity potentially linking you to terrorism.
The ?Potential Indicators of Terrorist Activities? contained in the flyer are
not to be construed alone as a sign of terrorist activity and the document
notes that ?just because someone?s speech, actions, beliefs, appearance, or
way of life is different; it does not mean that he or she is suspicious.?
However, many of the activities described in the document are basic practices
of any individual concerned with security or privacy online.  The use of PGP,
VPNs, Tor or any of the many other technologies for anonymity and privacy
online are directly targeted by the flyer, which is distributed to businesses
in an effort to promote the reporting of these activities.

So they're keep changing their story. It seems they want to get rid of you.
Of what concern should be the traffic, if it's a flat rodent data
plan? If it is, you have to throttle your node down to a dull roar
(e.g. I'm currently throttling mine down to about 1.5 TByte/month).
I personally use the following Exit Policy:
reject 0.0.0.0/8:*
reject 169.254.0.0/16:*
reject 127.0.0.0/8:*
reject 192.168.0.0/16:*
reject 10.0.0.0/8:*
reject 172.16.0.0/12:*
reject put-your-node's-ip-here:*
accept *:22
accept *:443
accept *:465
accept *:563
accept *:992-995
reject *:*
which so far has generated zero complaints.
If they still complain, go total middleman. Even
middlemen throttled to 120 kBytes/s or higher are
of value to the network, especially if they're stable.

Hash: SHA1
I think it might be possible to handle this from the client side by
building circuits with fewer than three hops.
If I remember right, hidden services work something like this:
* Alice, a client running a hidden service, chooses several
introduction points and builds a circuit to each one
* Alice anonymously publishes the addresses of the introduction points
* Bob, a client wishing to contact Alice's hidden service, anonymously
retrieves the addresses of the introduction points
* Bob chooses a rendezvous point and builds a circuit to it
* Bob builds a circuit to one of Alice's introduction points and
informs Alice of the rendezvous point
* If Alice accepts the connection, she builds a circuit to Bob's
rendezvous point, which connects Alice's circuit to Bob's circuit
* Alice and Bob communicate through the connected circuits
Usually each circuit has three hops, but if Alice and Bob don't need
to be anonymous or unlinkable they can use one-hop circuits. The final
connection would have two hops: Alice <-> rendezvous point <-> Bob.
The client is responsible for choosing the length of the circuit in
Tor, so it should be possible to do this through a client library like
Silvertunnel without modifying the protocol or the relays.

Any modern computer can run a tor exit node. You can even download hacked firmware for your linksys router that will allow you to run the node from your router.

Here is the Tor Project's page about running a relay. "If you have at least 30 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your Tor to be a relay too."
No powerful setup required, you're just donating bandwidth.

You can just do it at home, but it is advised to have a fast computer, and most of all, a fast internet connection. You're also responsible for your own internet connection. So if someone does bad things through your exit node, you're going to have a hard time explaining what happened to the authorities. If you do want to help the Tor network without any risk of getting in trouble, you can simply run a relay. That way you only send encrypted data to the next Tor relay.

I think a better analogy is taking a locked briefcase from a shady looking dude and delivering it for him or one of his friends, in exchange for him doing the same for you at some point in the future.
You can't logically infer wrongdoing from the use of tor. That's (partly) the point. Also, an IP address is not a person, nor is it an ID for a person.

    permalink
    report
    reply
[?]runasand[S] 26 points 2 hours ago*
The short answer for why Tor is slow is that there are 500,000 people using Tor daily and only 3000 relays in the network. You are sending your traffic through three relays somewhere in the world, and each relay have different amounts of bandwidth donated to Tor users. We need more people who can run relays and help the network grow even bigger.
If you want the longer answer to your question, then I suggest you read the blog post called Why Tor is slow and what we're going to do about it written by Roger in 2009.
To answer the second part of your question; yes, we depend on grants, donations, volunteers who help us with development, testing, documentation etc. All companies (non-profit or not) go through stages where there's a shortage of funds, and the Tor Project is no different. That said, I am really excited that we recently won the Knight News Challenge on Networks.

You are correct. Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a third-generation onion routing project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. It was originally developed with the U.S. Navy in mind, for the primary purpose of protecting government communications. To help convince you that Tor is not an intelligence honeypot:
    The code is open source and available online. You can find it on gitweb.torproject.org.
    Tor's protocol specifications is also available online.
    If we were to introduce a backdoor in our own software, we would not only have a broken tool, but a trashed reputation as well.
    Tor is used by 500,000 people daily, including core members of the Tor Project.
    Volunteers all over the world run 3000 relays in total. Your client will pick three relays at random when sending traffic through the network.

Thanks for everything you do! You're doing really important work and the world is a better place because of it.
It seems like there is an escalating conflict between the US government and groups who have a very different view on the purpose of the internet. The new NSA data center aims to completely destroy what privacy we may have left, and the government is getting even more aggressive with malware like flame and stuxnet. The US was embarrassed by wikileaks, and appears to have it out for Julian Assange. Groups like Anonymous are releasing sensitive information on a semi-regular basis, and it seems like all this can only go on so long before government campaigns like the ?war on drugs? and the ?war on terror? are joined by some sort of a ?war on cybercrime? that sees anonymity as a threat. Do you think the US government is making plans to infiltrate, disrupt, or take down the Tor network? Do you have plans on how to respond if it does?

First of all, I highly appreciate what you guys are doing. Even though I rarely use TOR myself, I believe that maintaining uncensored Internet access is one of the most important factors to improving the global human condition.
That being said, stories such as this one scare me. For me, this reduces the question of whether or not to run an exit node into "Am I willing to potentially face prosecution just because some asshole decided to browse kiddie porn at my expense?"
I'm sure this is one of the main concerns that holds people back from running an exit node. The suggestions that you list make a lot of sense, but they are mostly reactive. Are there proactive means to fight this? I guess any form of technical counter-measure can be interpreted as a form of censorship..

If you're an exit node, you're basically the unencrypted part of Tor. Your ISP can potentially track any traffic which comes out of there, including any of the various illegal things that people might use Tor for. You're basically at risk of any of the things that you might be at risk from if you didn't use Tor (and the things that other people want to use Tor to hide).
Whether or not your ISP will do anything about that is another question, but there is a good chance that other people's potentially illegal browsing will be recorded against your name. Whether or not this will -actually- cause any legal trouble, I don't know. Different ISPs/hosts have different policies, and I believe it's easily noticeable that traffic has come from Tor, so that may get you out of potential legal trouble for the traffic itself (or may get you banned by your ISP). IANAL, though.
Also, since Tor exit nodes are all public, some services (eg IRC servers) might automatically ban any IPs that are listed as exit nodes. It can also use a large amount of bandwidth, at some points it was close to maxing out my 100Mb/s server.
It's generally not a good idea to run an exit node on a home computer, or something where your outgoing traffic is important, and it's mostly more suitable for servers.
TL;DR: Yes there are real legal risks.

    Also how do you feel about the fact that a large number of Onion domains are used for transactions and sharing of illegal goods and services? Does this corrupt the original purpose of Tor or was it something you expected to go hand in hand with the project?
I think it's interesting to see people claim that a major part of hidden services is illegal content, without having any proof that this is really the case. We hear about all the bad things because that's what media likes to write about, but that doesn't mean there aren't a ton of good hidden services out there as well.
I can't really comment on the original purpose or if this was something that was expected. What I can say is that we are working hard to explain what Tor is and is not, and I think Karen's response in r/TOR regarding law enforcement and hidden services is a good one.

now, a question ... although i think this is impossible if you do not track anything ... but , what proprtion of the TOR network users are using tor as a simple proxy as opposed to browsing .onion sites?
(ps, i edited to say your doing an awesome job, i dont mean to sound like im hating on things... when this world goes to war , or the powers that be try and block the web,ill be moving to tor :D ... (i always have it ready but never really use it))

Tor is designed to protect your privacy by design. See:  for an overview. The idea is that the technology should protect you, not the ethics of the authors or relay operators.
The Tor people take anonymity seriously. See the discussions on the Tor mailing lists ( or bug tracker ( for an idea of their viewpoints.

The more you value keeping a bit of data, the more copies in a variety of locations, the better the chance the data has to survive.
Ofc, that has to be balanced between how much you'd like it to be kept secure too. Pick your storage places wisely. If a site is getting a reputation for being an illegal file haven, it's likely to attract the authorities sooner or later. Megaupload, for me, definitely had that reputation... so wasn't surprised to hear about the shutdown.

I absolutely support tor and the cryptoanarchy movement, but to claim that TOR doesnt make it easier to get away with the worst kinds of internet use is a lie.

Tor is a tool designed to protect anonymity and circumvent censorship. If Tor were designed in a way that could censor content or identify users, it would be broken by design.
Tor tries to make the software easy to use so that it is accessible to everyone. Tor has no data on the popularity of .onion sites; though it's no surprise that the most shocking content gets the most media attention.
Something to consider: if Tor did not exist, would these crimes go away? Sadly, people do fucked up things.

We decided to manually vet incoming attachments - well, that turned out to be an eye opening experience for me. It rapidly went from "I hope this helps cut down on the viruses" to "JESUS FUCK!

I route trackers through TOR due to some poorly implemented network filtering. I do not, however, route p2p through TOR, because I like my speeds to be countable in megabytes, not kilobits.
Could actually make it a point to blacklist exit nodes in torrent clients, but that's not the spirit of things. Alas, we're left with waiting until one infrastructure (free unblocker services, be it TOR or VPNs) can handle it or the other (the censored "free" internet) stops legislating the fuck out of it.

Now for the question. Have you ever been contacted by law enforcement regarding the use of tor for illicit activities? Have they tried taking legal action to take it down.
What is the future of tor? Will we see a return to having easier access to a standalone vidalia or is it more integration into the tor browser bundle?

    What is the future of tor? Will we see a return to having easier access to a standalone vidalia or is it more integration into the tor browser bundle?
We are going to discontinue the standalone Vidalia eventually and focus on the Tor Browser Bundle. We are also focusing more on trainings, support, a forum etc.

I can say a lot about how browsing with Tor is different from browsing without Tor, but I'll try to keep it short; when you are not browsing with Tor, you are allowing your ISP, anyone watching your network, and the websites you visit to learn what you are doing online, which sites you visit, what you searched for on Google, what you bought on Amazon, and so on. The article I wrote for ORGZine a few weeks ago has some more information about this.
Tor helps with a number of things, such as defending against traffic analysis, reducing your digital footprint, preventing your ISP from learning which websites you are visiting, and allowing you to access websites which have been blocked where you are currently located.
The tl;dr for how Tor anonymizes your traffic is that it wraps it in three layers of encryption and sends it through three random servers in the Tor network. The longer explanation, with detailed images, can be found on our overview page.

Depending on the client you are using when uploading the image, there is a chance that uploaded file's original path is exposed to the remove server. If you want to make sure that no sensitive data leaks out, upload the image from a home directory such as /home/derp or something.
    Can virus' and malware be installed on your computer by a 3rd party while you are using TOR if you was to click on a link that is actually a virus?
Tor protects you when you browse the Internet, it does not protect you from viruses in documents, software etc that you have downloaded onto your computer. I suggest you read the warning section on our website regarding opening files you have downloaded over Tor.

Browser addons, OS details and versions, screen resolution etc etc can be grabbed by a website depending on your settings. Tor makes your connection anonymous and privoxy strips out the data that can make your machine identifiable through the anonymous connection.

Tor is a truly wonderful project, but I think it's biggest problem is that (after some reading, I think) there are major downsides of operating a relay node, including the fact that by default, the operator takes all the heat for its users. While I'm sure there is legal shield in case of a charge (the operator's responsibility can be clearly lifted) this can often be only proven after a police raid, and long/costly legal procedures. Do you plan something that would convince more people to operate relays? I know TOR's system does not allow for "involuntary participation" like bittorrent, but currently it relies too much on the goodwill of a very few dedicated users.

I'd like to know what your thought are on Par: Payment for Anonymous Routing (PDF)?
The abstract of this paper is:
    Despite the growth of the Internet and the increasing concern for privacy of online communications, current deployments of anonymization networks depend on a very small set of nodes that volunteer their bandwidth. We believe that the main reason is not disbelief in their ability to protect anonymity, but rather the practical limitations in bandwidth and latency that stem from limited participation. This limited participation, in turn, is due to a lack of incentives to participate. We propose providing economic incentives, which historically have worked very well.
I personally think that economic incentives are critical to solving the "tor is slow" problem, but I'd love to hear your thoughts! Are you planning on incoroporating anything like this into tor?

How do you feel about illegal activity within the TOR network?
Sites like silkroad are actually OK with me, but with TOR there is also a possible way for CP to be distributed and so on.
Also, how did you come up with the idea to create such a network? Was there an inspiring paragon for the way you made it? How long did it take?
And last but not least. How can someone create a .onion-domain within the TOR network? I looked it up once but didn't seem to find anything.
Oh so many questions. I like you guys.

Traffic inside the network is encrypted. Traffic from the exit node to the destination server can only be encrypted if this server supports it. Tor can do nothing about that.

It seems like a lot of setup information about tor is outdated. I think one of the simplest improvements you can make to tor is to have a constantly updated official setup page that list and describes all of the software/settings needed to browse completely anonymously. I know tor browser bundle is pretty complete but when I look over setup information on the web it is easy to get confused about things like privoxy/torsocks/polipo. As seen previously in this thread, other people think that privoxy is necessary but you state that TBB no longer ships with it. Putting something like this on the front page of your website or somewhere very noticeable would help newbies quickly get started and not get lost in the non-user friendly documentation section of you website.
Other than that I must say that I love tor. It has helped many people bypass network restrictions at my residential high school and is know by name.

November 5, 2012, 9:25AM
Side-Channel Attack Steals Crypto Key from Co-Located Virtual Machines
by Michael Mimoso
Side-channel attacks against cryptography keys have, until now, been limited
to physical machines. Researchers have long made accurate determinations
about crypto keys by studying anything from variations in power consumption
to measuring how long it takes for a computation to complete.
A team of researchers from the University of North Carolina, University of
Wisconsin, and RSA Security has ramped up the stakes, having proved in
controlled conditions that it?s possible to steal a crypto key from a virtual
The implications for sensitive transactions carried out on public cloud
infrastructures could be severe should an attacker land his malicious virtual
machine on the same physical host as the victim. Research has already been
conducted on how to map a cloud infrastructure and identify where a target
virtual machine is likely to be.
The UNC and RSA researchers did not demonstrate their attack on a live public
cloud, but said their research shows that isolation of certain processes
doesn?t necessarily provide the protection once thought.
?This should serve as a warning that if you?ve got a highly sensitive
workload, you don?t want to run it near a dangerous bedfellow in the cloud,?
said Ari Juels, chief scientist at RSA Security. ?Also, if you?re concerned
about nation states, don?t run that relevant workload in a public cloud.?
The team, made of Juels, Yinqian Zhang and Michael K. Reiter of UNC, and
Thomas Ristenpart of the University of Wisconsin, carried out their attack in
an Amazon EC2-like environment with the Xen VMM in place. In any such virtual
environment, the hypervisor is what provides isolation and management for
virtual machines. In theory, the VMs are not aware of each other, but they do
share hardware resources on the physical host. The researchers were able to
extract enough information by observing shared resources, in this case the L1
instruction cache, to reconstruct the cryptographic key in post-processing.
They used an access-driven side-channel attack where in a matter of
milliseconds over the course of a particular processing operation, the
attacker and victim alternate process execution. The attacker would then
observe changes in the cache to extract the data they?re looking for.
What makes this attack unique is that the researchers here were able to
overcome succinct challenges presented by any VMM, namely 1) coarse
scheduling granularity which prevents two virtual machines from running
simultaneously, 2) data ?noise? introduced by the hypervisor on both the
hardware and software level that would make it difficult for an attacker to
filter and obtain what they?re after.
?When an attacker sees information in the cache, they may not be aware or
know whether the cache configuration reflects execution by the victim at
all,? said UNC?s Reiter. ?It might reflect dom0 or the hypervisor. If that?s
the case, there?s no information about the victim?s key to extract.?
In this attack, the researchers were able to extract a private ElGamal
decryption key from the target VM?s libgcrypt library; the target was running
Gnu Privacy Guard. Over the course of a few hours of observations, they were
able to reconstruct a 457-bit exponent accompanying a 4096-bit modulus with
high accuracy, the team?s paper said. ?So high that the attacker was then
left to search fewer than 10,000 possible exponents to find the right one,?
the paper said.
The team was able to execute its attack by filling the cache set with data, a
technique called Priming, and then measure the time it takes to fill the
cache set, called Probing.
?The attacker primes the cache, or fills it with his own data, the probes it
to see what parts of the cache have been evicted,? Reiter said. The attacker
then observes the behavior of what ran in the interim. ?Whatever ran,
utilized data that mapped to that caches set,? Reiter said. ?From that, an
attacker can build a profile of what the other side is doing.
?The real trick is to get useful information. The attacker has to overcome
scheduling granularity the hypervisor imposes,? Reiter said. ?Xen has 30
milliseconds. You have to give up the core, come back 30 milliseconds later
and see the accumulated sum of activity and its effect on the core.?
The researchers were able to get much more granular scheduling and figured
out how to strip out the irrelevant noise in order to pull off the attack.
Again, this was in a controlled environment, Reiter and Juels said. For
example, the target virtual machine was repeatedly performing cryptographic
operations, a scenario that would be unlikely in most real-world public
?The victim will not always be running a cryptographic operation; you could
be observing something unrelated and that operation becomes noise,? Juels
said. ?Processing takes place afterwards; the harvesting is done in real
time. To mount this attack successfully, it would be helpful to make frequent
observations of the victim.
?At present, this is a fairly elaborate attack and we would expect it to be
mounted only by a sophisticated attack organization such as a nation-state,?
Juels said. ?This research shows this type of attack is feasible.?

generated that someone's using it to source child porn or terrorist
communications or DMCA violations.  At the most extreme the owner can
shut down a node; they might also put egress filters in place pursuant
to notifications.
Plenty of small ISPs in one sense or another don't comply with CALEA
because they own systems not networks (open access sites, etc).  CALEA
goes to the network providers in those cases, as I understand it.

While it is no secret that intercontinental fiber taps exist, you would not route the traffic itself over the Atlantic to an
intercept and analysis point and then back (you would see that
in giant added latency), but to tap the signal not too
far from the fiber landing point, since you would need to
analyze it in a somewhat big box probably not residing on the seabed.
It is probably easier to local intelligence services to co-operate intensively, and intercept data close to exchange
points, and share results of analysis (only sharing realtime
communication taps on a very small set of high value targets).
Such sharing can happen over dedicated channels, or over VPN
tunnels over the public Internet.
Passive traffic analysis does not require being part of the Tor
network (though operating a noticeable number of compromised Tor nodes would give you additional information which is not easily
available with traffic analysis).

Leave Your Cellphone at Home
Interview with Jacob Appelbaum
Earlier this year in Wired, writer and intelligence expert James Bamford
described the National Security Agency?s plans for the Utah Data Center. A
nondescript name, but it has another: the First Intelligence Community
Comprehensive National Cyber-security Initiative Data Center. The $2 billion
facility, scheduled to open in September 2013, will be used to intercept,
decipher, analyze, and store the agency?s intercepted
communications?everything from emails, cell phone calls, Google searches, and
Tweets, to retail transactions. How will all this data be stored? Imagine, if
you can, 100,000 square-feet filled with row upon row of servers, stacked
neatly on racks. Bamford projects that its processing-capacity may aspire to
yottabytes, or 1024 bytes, and for which no neologism of higher magnitude has
yet been coined.  To store the data, the NSA must first collect it, and here Bamford relies on
a man named William Binney, a former NSA crypto-mathematician, as his main
source. For the first time, since leaving the NSA in 2001, Binney went on the
record to discuss Stellar Wind, which we all know by now as the warrantless
wiretapping program, first approved by George Bush after the 2001 attacks on
the twin towers. The program allowed the NSA to bypass the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, in charge of authorizing eavesdropping on
domestic targets, permitting the wholesale monitoring of millions of American
phone calls and emails. In his thirty years at the NSA, Binney helped to
engineer its automated system of networked data collection which, until 2001,
was exclusively directed at foreign targets. Binney left when the
organization started to use this same technology to spy on American citizens.
He tells of secret electronic monitoring rooms in major US telecom
facilities, controlled by the NSA, and powered by complex software programs
examining Internet traffic as it passes through fiber-optic cables. (At a
local event last week, Binney circulated a list of possible interception
points, including 811 10th Avenue, between 53rd & 54th St., which houses the
largest New York exchange of AT&T Long Lines.) He tells of software, created
by a company called Narus, that parses US data sources: any communication
arousing suspicion is automatically copied and sent to the NSA. Once a name
enters the Narus database, all phone calls, emails and other communications
are automatically routed to the NSA?s recorders.
The NSA wasn?t the only intelligence-gathering agency to have its domestic
surveillance powers expanded in the wake of September 11th. The USA PATRIOT
Act, for instance, allows the FBI to spy on US citizens without demonstrating
probable cause that its targets are engaged in criminal activities. Under
Section 215 of the Act, the now infamous National Security Letters?which
formerly required that the information being sought pertain to a foreign
power or agent of a foreign power?can compel the disclosure of sensitive
information held by banks, credit companies, telephone carrier, and Internet
Service Providers, among many others, about US citizens. The recipient of an
NSL is typically gagged from disclosing the fact or nature of the request.
It?s no secret that, whereas the Fourth Amendment prevents against
unreasonable search and seizure, concerns over ?national security? occasioned
its disregard and the violation of privacy rights of even the most ordinary
citizens. Activists have all the more reason to worry, repeatedly turning up
as the subject of terrorist investigations. For instance, in 2006 the ACLU
revealed that the Pentagon was secretly conducting surveillance of protest
activities, antiwar organizations, and groups opposed to military recruitment
policies, including Quakers and student organizations. Relying on sources
from the Department of Homeland Security, local police departments, and FBI
Joint Terrorism Task Forces, the Pentagon collected, stored, and shared this
data through the Threat and Local Observation Database, or TALON, designed to
track terrorist threats. Or take Scott Crow, a self-described anarchist and
veteran organizer in the global justice movement, who, as the New York Times
reported last year, is one of dozens of political activists across the
country to have come under scrutiny from the FBI?s increased counterterrorism
operation. The FBI set up a video camera outside his house, monitored guests
as they came and went, tracked his emails and phone conversations, and picked
through his trash to identify his bank and mortgage companies, presumably to
send them subpoenas. Others to have been investigated included animal rights
activists in Virginia and liberal Roman Catholics in Nebraska. When in 2008,
President Obama took the reigns from George W. Bush, there was an expectation
that much, or at least some, of this activity would be curbed. Yet, as
Bamford?s article attests, the goverment?s monitoring and collection of our
digital data remains steadfast.
When the Occupy protests started in mid-September of last year, I relied on
data-generating technologies increasingly, more so than I had ever before.
Within a few weeks I had joined multiple OWS-related listservs; I?d started
following Twitter with unprecedented commitment; I spent more hours on
Facebook than I care to acknowledge. I doubt I am the only one. At the same
time, there was a widespread sense of precaution?just because we were
engaging in legal activities, covered by our First Amendment rights, no one,
it seemed, should presume herself exempt from the possibility of
surveillance. Sensitive conversations took place in loud bars, never over
email. Text messages were presumed unsafe. In meetings, cell phone batteries
were removed on occasion. Nevertheless, it was easy to feel unimportant (why
would anyone watch me?) and equally easy to let standards relax?especially
when it meant reclaiming conveniences that, once enjoyed, we?re difficult to
give up. Leaving a trail of potentially incriminating digital data seemed
inevitable. But how bad could it really be? And was there no way to use these
same tools while safeguarding our privacy?
In late April, I sat down with the independent security researcher, hacker,
and privacy advocate Jacob Appelbaum, who knows a thing or two about the
surveillance state. Appelbaum is one of the key members of the Tor project,
which relies on a worldwide volunteer network of servers to reroute Internet
traffic across a set of encrypted relays. Doing so conceals a user?s
location, and protects her from a common form of networking surveillance
known as traffic analysis, used to infer who is talking to whom over a public
network. Tor is both free (as in freedom) and free of charge. Appelbaum is
also the only known American member of the international not-for-profit
Resnick: The recent article in Wired describes where and how the NSA plans to
store its share of collected data. But as the article explains, the Utah
facility will have another important function: cryptanalysis, or
code-breaking, as much of the data cycling through will be heavily encrypted.
It also suggests that the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), expected to
remain durable for at least another decade, may be cracked by the NSA in a
much shorter time if they?ve built a secret computer that is considerably
faster than any of the machines we know about. But more to the point?is
encryption safe?
Appelbaum: Some of it is as safe as we think it can be, and some of it is not
safe at all. The number one rule of ?signals intelligence? is to look for
plain text, or signaling information?who is talking to whom. For instance,
you and I have been emailing, and that information, that metadata, isn?t
encrypted, even if the contents of our messages are. This ?social graph?
information is worth more than the content. So, if you use SSL-encryption to
talk to the OWS server for example, great, they don?t know what you?re
saying. Maybe. Let?s assume the crypto is perfect. They see that you?re in a
discussion on the site, they see that Bob is in a discussion, and they see
that Emma is in a discussion. So what happens? They see an archive of the
website, maybe they see that there were messages posted, and they see that
the timing of the messages correlates to the time you were all browsing
there. They don?t need to know to break a crypto to know what was said and
who said it.
Resnick: And this type of surveillance is called ?? Appelbaum: Traffic analysis. It?s as if they are sitting outside your house,
watching you come and go, as well as the house of every activist you deal
with. Except they?re doing it electronically. They watch you, they take
notes, they infer information by the metadata of your life, which implies
what it is that you?re doing. They can use it to figure out a cell of people,
or a group of people, or whatever they call it in their parlance where
activists become terrorists. And it?s through identification that they move
into specific targeting, which is why it?s so important to keep this
information safe first.
For example, they see that we?re meeting. They know that I have really good
operational security. I have no phone. I have no computer. It would be very
hard to track me here unless they had me physically followed. But they can
still get to me by way of you. They just have to own your phone, or steal
your recorder on the way out. The key thing is that good operational security
has to be integrated into all of our lives so that observation of what we?re
doing is much harder. Of course it?s not perfect. They can still target us,
for instance, by sending us an exploit in our email, or a link in a web
browser that compromises each of our computers. But if they have to exploit
us directly, that changes things a lot. For one, the NYPD is not going to be
writing exploits. They might buy software to break into your computer, but if
they make a mistake, we can catch them. But it?s impossible to catch them if
they?re in a building somewhere reading our text messages as they flow by, as
they go through the switching center, as they write them down. We want to
raise the bar so much that they have to attack us directly, and then in
theory the law protects us to some extent.
Resnick: So if I were arrested, and the evidence presented came from a
targeted attack on my computer, and I knew about the attack, I would have
some kind of legal recourse?
Appelbaum: Well, that?s an interesting question. What is the legal standard
for breaking into someone?s computer because they were at a protest?
Congratulations, take that to the Supreme Court, you might be able to make
some really good law. I think the answer is that it?s a national newsworthy
incident?nobody knows the cops break into people?s computers. The cops break
into someone?s house, the Fourth Amendment is super clear about that?it can?t
be done without a warrant.
Resnick: In January of last year, it was reported that the records for your
Twitter account? along with those of Julian Assange, Private Bradley Manning,
Dutch hacker Rop Gonggrjp, and Icelandic lawmaker Brigatta Jonsdottir?were
subpoenaed by the US government. What is perhaps most notable in this case is
not that the accounts were subpoenaed, but that the orders, usually gagged
and carried out in secret, became public knowledge. Twitter contested the
secrecy order and won the right to notify you. Several months later, the Wall
Street Journal revealed that Google and the Internet service provider
Sonic.net, had received similar orders to turn over your data.
Appelbaum: Twitter notified me. But as for Google and Sonic.net, I read about
it in the Wall Street Journal like everybody else. So now I can talk about it
because it was in a public newspaper. Those are ?2703(d) administrative
subpoenas,? and they asked for IP addresses, and the email addresses of the
people I communicated with, among other things. The government asserts that
it has the right to get that metadata, that ?signaling? or relationship
information, without a warrant. They get to gag the company, and the company
can?t fight it, because it?s not their data, it?s my data, or it?s data about
me, so they have no Constitutional standing. And the government asserts that
I have no expectation of privacy because I willingly disclosed it to a third
party. And in fact my Twitter data was given to the government?no one has
really written about that yet. We are still appealing but we lost the stay,
which means Twitter had to disclose the data to the government, and whether
or not they can use it is pending appeal. Once they get the data, it?s not
like it?s private or secret?and even if they can?t use it as evidence, they
can still use it in their investigations.
Resnick: In January of this year, the Twitter account of writer and OWS
protester Malcolm Harris was subpoenaed by the Manhattan District Attorney?s
Office. I think it?s safe to assume these incidents are not anomalies. In
which case, is there a way to use social media sites like Twitter without
putting our private data at risk? Because these sites can be very useful
tools of course.
Appelbaum: In the case of something like Twitter, you can use Tor on the
Android phone?we have a version of Tor for Android called Orbot?and Twitter
together and that?s essentially the best you?re going to do. And even that
isn?t particularly great. Twitter keeps a list of IP addresses where you?ve
logged in, but if you use Tor, it won?t know you are logging in from your
phone. It?s powerful, but the main problem is that it?s kind of complicated
to use. On your computer, you can use the Tor browser, and when you log into
Twitter, you?re fine, no problem all?your IP address will trace back to Tor
again. So now when the government asserts that you have no expectation of
privacy, you can say all right, well I believe I have an expectation of
privacy, which is why I use Tor. I signal that. And the private messaging
capability of Twitter?don?t use it for sensitive stuff. Twitter keeps a copy
of all its messages.
Resnick: During the perceived wave of Internet activism throughout the 2009
Iranian election protests, a new proprietary software called Haystack
received a lot of media attention. Haystack promised Iranian activists
tightly encrypted messages, access to censored websites, and the ability to
obfuscate Internet traffic. You later tested the software and demonstrated
its claims to be false. For those of us who don?t have your technical skill
set, how can we assess whether a particular tool is safe to use, especially
if it?s new?
Appelbaum: First, is the source code available? Second, if the claims are
just too good to be true, they probably are. There?s a thing called snake oil
crypto or snake oil software, where the product promises the moon and the
sun. When a developer promises that a proprietary software is super secure
and only used by important people, it?s sketchy. Third, are the people
working on this part of the community that has a reputation for accomplishing
these things? That?s a hard one, but ask someone you know and trust. How
would you go on a date with someone? How would you do an action with someone?
Transitive trust is just as important in these situations.
Another thing to look at is whether it?s centralized or decentralized. For
example Haystack was centralized, whereas Tor is decentralized. Also, how is
it sustained? Will it inject ads into your web browser, like AnchorFree, the
producer of the Hotspot Shield VPN? Or is it like Riseup.net, whose VPN
service monetizes not through your traffic, but through donations and
solidarity and mutual aid? And if they can inject ads, that means they can
inject a back door. That?s super sketchy?if they do that, that?s bad news. So
you want to be careful about that.
Finally, remember: The truth is like a bullet that pierces through the armor
of charlatans.
Resnick: What should we know about cell phones? It?s hard to imagine going to
a protest without one. But like all networked technologies, surely they are
Appelbaum: Cell phones are tracking devices that make phone calls. It?s sad,
but it?s true. Which means software solutions don?t always matter. You can
have a secure set of tools on your phone, but it doesn?t change the fact that
your phone tracks everywhere you go. And the police can potentially push
updates onto your phone that backdoor it and allow it to be turned into a
microphone remotely, and do other stuff like that. The police can identify
everybody at a protest by bringing in a device called an IMSI catcher. It?s a
fake cell phone tower that can be built for 1500 bucks. And once nearby,
everybody?s cell phones will automatically jump onto the tower, and if the
phone?s unique identifier is exposed, all the police have to do is go to the
phone company and ask for their information.
Resnick: So phones are tracking devices. They can also be used for
surreptitious recording. Would taking the battery out disable this
capability? Appelbaum: Maybe. But iPhones, for instance, don?t have a removable battery;
they power off via the power button. So if I wrote a backdoor for the iPhone,
it would play an animation that looked just like a black screen. And then
when you pressed the button to turn it back on it would pretend to boot. Just
play two videos.
Resnick: And how easy is it to create something like to that?
Appelbaum: There are weaponized toolkits sold by companies like FinFisher
that enable breaking into BlackBerries, Android phones, iPhones, Symbian
devices and other platforms. And with a single click, say, the police can own
a person, and take over her phone.
Resnick: Right?in November of last year, the Wall Street Journal first
reported on this new global market for off-the-shelf surveillance technology,
and created ?Surveillance Catalog? on their website, which includes documents
obtained from attendees of a secretive surveillance conference held near
Washington, D.C. WikiLeaks has also released documents on these companies.
The industry has grown from almost nothing to a retail market worth $5
billion per year. And whereas companies making and selling this gear say it
is available only to governments and law enforcement and is intended to catch
criminals, critics say the market represents a new sort of arms trade
supplying Western governments and repressive nations alike.
Appelbaum: It?s scary because [accessing these products is so] easy. But when
a company builds a backdoor, and sells it, and says trust us, only good guys
will use it? well, first of all, we don?t know how to secure computers, and
anybody that says otherwise is full of shit. If Google can get owned, and
Boeing can get owned, and Lockheed Martin can get owned, and engineering and
communication documents from Marine One can show up on a filesharing network,
is it realistic to assume that perfect security is possible? Knowing this is
the case, the right thing is to not build any backdoors. Or assume these
backdoors are all abused and bypass them so that the data acquired is very
uninteresting. Like encrypted phone calls between two people?it?s true they
can wiretap the data, but they?ll just get noise.
When Hillary Clinton and the State Department say they want to help people
abroad fight repressive governments, they paint Internet freedom as something
they can enable with $25 million. Whereas in reality the FBI makes sure that
our communications tech isn?t secure. This makes it impossible for people
like me to help people abroad overthrow their governments because our
government has ensured that all their technology is backdoor ready. And in
theory, they try to legitimize state surveillance here, and there they try to
make it illegitimate. They say, ?In over-there-a-stan, surveillance is
oppressive. But over here, it?s okay, we have a lawful process.? (Which is
not necessarily a judicial process. For example, Eric Holder and the drones .
. . sounds like a band, right?)
Resnick: Okay, so one thing I?ve heard more than once at meetings when
security culture comes up is that . . . well, there?s a sense that too much
precaution grows into (or comes out of) paranoia, and paranoia breeds
mistrust?and all of it can be paralyzing and lead to a kind of inertia. How
would you respond to something like that?
Appelbaum: The people who that say that?if they?re not cops, they?re feeling
unempowered. The first response people have is, whatever, I?m not important.
And the second is, they?re not watching me, and even if they were, there?s
nothing they could find because I?m not doing anything illegal. But the thing
is, taking precautions with your communications is like safe sex in that you
have a responsibility to other people to be safe?your transgressions can fuck
other people over. The reality is that when you find out it will be too late.
It?s not about doing a perfect job, it?s about recognizing you have a
responsibility to do that job at all, and doing the best job you can manage,
without it breaking down your ability to communicate, without it ruining your
day, and understanding that sometimes it?s not safe to undertake an action,
even if other times you would. That?s the education component.
So security culture stuff sounds crazy, but the technological capabilities of
the police, especially with these toolkits for sale, is vast. And to thwart
that by taking all the phones at a party and putting them in a bag and
putting them in the freezer and turning on music in the other room?true,
someone in the meeting might be a snitch, but at least there?s no audio
recording of you.
Part of informed consent is understanding the risks you are taking as you
decide whether to participate in something. That?s what makes us free?the
freedom to question what we?re willing to do. And of course it?s fine to do
that. But it?s not fine to say, I don?t believe there?s a risk, you?re being
paranoid, I?m not a target. When people say that they don?t want to take
precautions, we need to show them how easy it is to do it. And to insist that
not doing it is irresponsible, and most of all, that these measures are
effective to a degree, and worth doing for that reason. And it?s not about
perfection, because perfection is the enemy of ?good enough.?
I would encourage people to think about the activity they want to engage in,
and then say, Hey, this is what I want to do. Work together collaboratively
to figure out how to do that safely and securely, but also easily without
needing to give someone a technical education. Because that?s a path of
madness. And if people aren?t willing to change their behaviors a little bit,
you just can?t work with them. I mean that?s really what it comes down to. If
people pretend that they?re not being oppressed by the state when they are
literally being physically beaten, and forced to give up retinal scans,
that?s fucking ridiculous. We have to take drastic measures for some of these
The FBI has this big fear that they?re going to ?go dark,? which means that
all the ways they currently obtain information will disappear. Well, America
started with law enforcement in the dark; once, we were perceived to be
innocent until proven guilty. And just because the surveillance is expanding,
and continues to expand, doesn?t mean we shouldn?t push back. If you haven?t
committed a crime they should have no reason to get that information about
you, especially without a warrant.
Resnick: Are there any other tools or advice you would suggest to an
activist, or anyone for that matter?
Appelbaum: Well, it?s important to consider the whole picture of all the
electronic devices that we have. First, you should use Tor and the Tor
browser for web browsing. Know that your home internet connection is probably
not safe, particularly if it?s tied to your name. If you use a Mac or Windows
operating system, be especially careful. For instance, there?s a program
called Evilgrade that makes it easy for attackers to install a backdoor on a
computer by exploiting weaknesses in the auto-update feature of many software
programs. So if you have Adobe?s PDF reader, and you?re downloading and
installing the update from Adobe, well, maybe you?ll get a little extra
thing, and you?re owned. And the cops have a different but better version of
that software. Which is part of why I encourage people to use Ubontu or
Debian or Linux instead of proprietary systems like a Mac or whatever.
Because there are exploits for everything. If you?re in a particularly
sensitive situation, use a live bootable CD called TAILS?it gives you a Linux
desktop where everything routes over Tor with no configuration. Or, if you?re
feeling multilingual, host stuff in another country. Open an email account in
Sweden, and use TAILS to access it. Most important is to know your options. A
notepad next to a fireplace is a lot more secure than a computer in some
ways, especially a computer with no encryption. You can always throw the
notepad in the fireplace and that?s that.
For email, using Riseup.net is good news. The solutions they offer are
integrated with Tor as much as possible. They?re badass. Because of the way
they run the system, I?m pretty sure that the only data they have is
encrypted. And I?d like to think that what little unencrypted data they do
have, they will fight tooth and nail to protect. Whereas, yes, you can use
Tor and Gmail together, but it?s not as integrated?when you sign in, Gmail
doesn?t ask if you want to route this over Tor. But also, Google inspects
your traffic as a method of monetization. I?d rather give Riseup fifty
dollars a month for the equivalent service of Gmail, knowing their commitment
to privacy. And also knowing that they would tell the cops to go fuck
themselves. There?s a lot of value in that.
For chatting, use software with off-the-record messaging (OTR)?not Google?s
?go off the record,? but the actual encryption software?which allows you to
have an end-to-end encrypted conversation. And configure it to work with Tor.
You can bootstrap a secure communication channel on top of an insecure one.
On a Mac, use Adium?it comes with OTR, but you still have to turn it on. When
you chat with people, click verify and read the fingerprint to each other
over the telephone. You want to do this because there could be a ?man in the
middle? relaying the messages, which means that you are both talking to a
third party, and that third party is recording it all.
As for your cell phone, consider it a tracking device and a monitoring device
and treat it appropriately. Be very careful about using cell phones, but
consider especially the patterns you make. If you pull the battery, you?ve
generated an anomaly in your behavior, and perhaps that?s when they trigger
people to go physically surveil you. Instead, maybe don?t turn it off, just
leave it at home. Because, as I said earlier, in a world with lots of data
retention, our data trails tell a story about us, and even if the story is
made of truthful facts, it?s not necessarily the truth. On a cell phone, you
can install stuff like OStel, which allows you to make encrypted
voice-over-the-Internet calls, or PrivateGSM?it?s not free, but it?s
available for BlackBerries, Android phones, iPhones and so on. Which means
that if they want to intercept your communication, they have to break into
your phone. It?s not perfect. Gibberbot for the Android allows you to use Tor
and Jabber?which is like Google Chat?with OTR automatically configured. You
type in your Jabber ID, it routes over Tor, and when you chat with other
people, it encrypts the messages end-to-end so even the Jabber server can?t
see what?s being said. And there are a lot of tools like that to choose from.
Another thing to consider is the mode in which we meet. If we want to edit
something collaboratively, there?s a program called Etherpad. And there?s a
social networking application called Crabgrass, and hosted at we.riseup.net.
It?s like a private Facebook. Riseup still has a lot of the data, but it?s
private by default. So it?s secure, short of being hacked, which is possible,
or short of some legal process. And if you use it in a Tor browser, and never
reveal information about yourself, you?re in really good shape. Unlike
Facebook, which is like the Stasi, but crowdsourced. And I mean that in the
nicest way possible. I once had a Facebook account?it?s fun and a great way
to meet people. But it is not safe for political organizing, especially when
you?re part of the minority, or when you?re not part of the minority, but you
are part of the disempowered majority.
As a final thought, I?d say just to remember that a big part of this is
social behavior and not technology per se. And a big part of it is accepting
that while we may live in a dystopian society right now, we don?t always have
to. That?s the tradeoff, right? Because what is OWS working toward? The
answer is, something different. And if we want an end to social inequality,
the surveillance state is part of what we have to change. If we make it
worthless to surveil people, we will have done this. So, it needs to be the
case that what we do doesn?t hang us for what we wish to create.

Presentation speakers
     New!  On DVD
    Kazakhstan blocked Tor using Deep Packet Inspection in January 2012.
China started probing Tor bridges using a system that is aimed directly at
Tor, and using code that actually speaks the Tor protocol. Iran started
blocking SSL connections on Valentine?s Day, in preparation for its ?halal?
Internet. Mobile operators in the US and the UK continue to filter and censor
websites for customers. The government in the UK proposed plans for mass
surveillance. Activists in Iran and Syria were targeted with malware, and the
government in Kuwait proposed plans to regulate the use of social networking
    These are some of the Internet censorship events we have seen so far in
2012, and we have only scratched the surface.
    In this presentation,  I will talk about how the blocking is done (in
terms of what signatures are filtered in Tor, and how we have gotten around
the blocking in each case), and what technologies are being used to filter
Internet traffic ? including the use of Western technology to operate the
surveillance and censorship infrastructure in the Middle East.
    I will cover what we have learned so far about the mindset of the censor,
as well as the users being censored, and how we can measure and track the
wide-scale censorship in these countries using a framework we have developed.
Lastly, I will explain Tor?s development plans to continue to evade
censorship and enable thousands of users around the world to access a free
and open Internet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Botnet command server hidden in Tor 
(can hardly be the first, can it?)
Botnet command server hidden in Tor
The G Data SecurityLabs recently identified a malware sample that takes the next step in Command-and-Control (short: C&C) communication evolution, regarding C&C traffic obfuscation. The botnet owners placed their C&C server, which uses the common IRC protocol, as a hidden service inside of the Tor network.
The analyzed bot:
Despite the novel way of C&C-communication, the other features of the analyzed bot are quite common these days. It offers several possibilities for DDoS attacks, can download and execute other malware, and can act as SOCKS proxy to anonymize the attacker.
What is it about?
One of the biggest challenges for botnet owners is the protection of Command-and-Control traffic. C&C traffic is required to give orders to the "zombies", the infected computers that are part of the botnets. Generally, up to now, two approaches existed for C&C traffic: Either a central control server is put somewhere on the Internet or Peer-to-Peer-networks (short: P2P) are built up to ensure the chain of commands.
One central C&C server:
Central control servers have a big problem: Regardless of the underlying protocol, they are a "single point of failure". The servers can be taken over by authorities, and thus the malware can be uninstalled from the zombies. It is possible to conceal the server, e.g. by having a hidden algorithm that changes domain names on a daily base; but these algorithms can be reverse engineered.
Schematic of direct client-Command-and-Control server communication
The P2P architecture:
An alternative is the usage of classic P2P networks. P2P networks became (in)famous with the rise of Napster, which used to be a service where every user could send and receive music from and to other users. Every user acted as client and server simultaneously, hence the term Peer-to-Peer.
Malware adapted to this scheme by giving every zombie the ability to issue commands to other zombies. The botnet owner issues the command to a handful of zombies, and these zombies propagate the commands to other zombies, and so on and so forth. Even though this seems to be more sophisticated than the direct client-server-communication, it is anything but perfect.
Zombies are often located behind routers, meaning that they effectively cannot act as a server, because the routers do not allow incoming traffic by default. Also, the protocol has to be especially designed for the respective bot, which results in a great implementation effort.
Furthermore, there are security issues the botnet owners have to think about: By design, every zombie programmed for the P2P-communication has the ability to issue commands to other zombies. Therefore authorities or other cybercriminals could issue commands to conduct a hostile takeover of the botnet. Generally, it is possible to authenticate messages, but botnet owners often find it hard to implement this or are not willing to put that much effort into these authentication mechanisms. This resulted in several botnet takedowns and even takeovers in the last couple of years.
The next step made ? using the Tor network
The next step in evolution is the usage of the Tor network. Tor is generally known as web anonymization service for end users, but Tor offers more than that: ?Tor makes it possible for users to hide their locations while offering various kinds of services, such as web publishing or an instant messaging server.?
In this particular case, the creators of the malware decided to build an IRC server as hidden service.
Schematic of the client-Command-and-Control server communication using the Tor network with Hidden Services
This gains the botnet owner several advantages:
    The server is anonymous and thus cannot point to the botnet owners? identity.
    The server cannot be taken down easily.
    The traffic is encrypted by Tor, so it can?t be blocked by Intrusion Detection Systems.
    Tor traffic usually cannot be blocked altogether, because there are also legit use cases for Tor.
    The bot creator does not necessarily have to generate a custom protocol, but can use the known and reliable IRC protocol.
Besides these advantages, it has to be noted that malware like this suffers from the latencies that come with the Tor network. In other words: Tor tends to be slow and unreliable, and inherits these flaws to underlying botnets. Also, while this traffic adds a lot of security to the botnet communication, the malware itself still can be blocked by AV software using signature- and behavior-based detection mechanism.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor bridge available over Hyperboria 
[?]HyperGrundy[S] 2 points 29 minutes ago*
Sure! First a warning: Tor will leak your IPv4 internet address to clients using your bridge even if they are connecting only through cjdns, so don't set this up if you don't want your cjdns node's public internet IP to be freely available to other cjdns users. I'm hoping Tor will fix that eventually. :P
Here it is:
First, set yourself up a working cjdns node. I used a Debian box, so the details will reflect that.
Second, install the latest Tor on your node. Not the Tor Browser Bundle, that's a GUI client, you need just the server software. I used the information here to add the Tor repositories to my sources.list so that I always have it up to date and just ran "apt-get install tor". Links for other distros/OSes are on the left of that page, buy why would you want those when you can use Debian? :)
Third, edit the /etc/tor/torrc file to have these key lines:
SocksPort 0                 socks proxy, this is a relay/bridge only
 need this line to force Tor to bind to be aware of your internet IP, otherwise it won't be
 to route out to the rest of the Tor network: (Tor should fix that)

Tor is not designed to resist a global passive adversary.
The Internet topology is mostly a tree. Tapping the fiber at a few chokepoints
(e.g. 5 for Germany) is sufficient to access the bulk of traffic.
At a higher level, tapping the undersea fiber allows you to selectively
filter out a subset of interesting traffic, including ability to intercept and store a subset of that subset entirely.
We do know that sigint is shared across jurisdictions as part of
extensive, informal intelligence collaboration.
Use Tor, but don't trust your life with it.

The presumed case is whether a Tor user has a problem,
which likely means she can't can't use Tor, so you'll
need a legacy channel for support.
Forums aren't all that bad for support, as more advanced
users will support less advanced ones thus easing your
support load. But you still need at least a few clueful parties who constantly monitor the forum and prime the pump by providing high-quality answers.
I've personally used forums to look for support, but
I almost never give support there due to too high
friction. Hundreds of tabs, unlike email where everything
is serialized, forcing you to deal with it.

Of course there should be forums and all other means of user
support. It's just that people who're comfortable with that

Group Thinks Anonymity Should Be Baked Into the Internet Itself
Following NSA surveillance revelations, talks advance on making the
privacy-protecting tool Tor an Internet standard.
By David Talbot on November 26, 2013
WHY IT MATTERS
Published reports suggest that Internet traffic is widely spied upon by the
NSA and other government agencies.
The Internet?s main engineers have asked the architects of Tor?networking
software designed to make Web browsing private?to consider turning the
technology into an Internet standard.
If widely adopted, such a standard would make it easy to include the
technology in consumer and business products ranging from routers to apps.
This would, in turn, allow far more people to browse the Web without being
identified by anyone who might be spying on Internet traffic.
If the discussions bear fruit, it could lead to the second major initiative
of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in response to the mass
surveillance by the National Security Administration. Already the IETF is
working to encrypt more of the data that flows between your computer and the
websites you visit (see ?Engineers Plan a Fully Encrypted Internet?).
Collaborating with Tor would add an additional layer of security and privacy.
When Tor is successfully used, the websites you visit don?t know the true
address and location of your computer, and anyone watching traffic from your
computer wouldn?t know where you?re browsing?a distinct layer of protection
that goes beyond encrypting your communications.
Stephen Farrell, a computer scientist at Trinity College, Dublin, believes
that forging Tor into a standard that interoperates with other parts of the
Internet could be better than leaving Tor as a separate tool that requires
people to take special action to implement. ?I think there are benefits that
might flow in both directions,? he says. ?I think other IETF participants
could learn useful things about protocol design from the Tor people, who?ve
faced interesting challenges that aren?t often seen in practice. And the Tor
people might well get interest and involvement from IETF folks who?ve got a
lot of experience with large-scale systems.?
Andrew Lewman, executive director of Tor, says the group is considering it.
?We?re basically at the stage of ?Do we even want to go on a date together??
It?s not clear we are going to do it, but it?s worth exploring to see what is
involved. It adds legitimacy, it adds validation of all the research we?ve
done,? he says. On the other hand, he adds: ?The risks and concerns are that
it would tie down developers in rehashing everything we?ve done, explaining
why we made decisions we made. It also opens it up to being weakened,? he
says, because third-party companies implementing Tor could add their own
The IETF is an informal organization of engineers that changes Internet code
and operates by rough consensus. Internet service providers, companies, and
websites aren?t required to implement any standards the IETF issues. And even
if security standards are implemented, they may not be widely deployed. For
example, years ago the IETF created a standard for encrypting Web traffic
between your computer and the websites you visit. Although this standard,
HTTPS, is built into most software for serving Web pages and browsing the
Web, only banks, e-commerce sites, and a number of big websites like Google
and Facebook have elected to actually use it. The IETF hopes to make such
encryption the default for a future Web communications standard known as HTTP
The Tor Project is a nonprofit group that receives government and private
funding to produce its software, which is used by law enforcement agencies,
journalists, and criminals alike. The technology originally grew out of work
by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory aimed at protecting military users (see
?Dissent Made Safer?).
When someone installs Tor on his computer and takes other precautions, it
supplies that computer with a directory of relays, or network points, whose
owners have volunteered to handle Tor traffic. Tor then ensures that the
user?s traffic takes extra steps through the Internet. At each stop, the
previous computer address and routing information get freshly encrypted,
meaning the final destination sees only the address of the most recent relay,
and none of the previous ones.
Leaks by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, suggest that circumventing
Tor was one of the NSA?s goals, and that the agency had had some success (see
?Anonymity Network Tor Needs a Tune-up to Protect Users from Surveillance?).
?We are about 10 people, and have multibillion dollar agencies trying to
break our technology,? Lewman says.

He seems to believe in responsive disclosure (Cablegate set a few
ops in the field scrambling overnight), but he also purportedly
posted large torrents of insurance, with presumably a dead man switch to release the key to access it.
I'm personally increasingly dissatisfied with some of redacting, done
by increasing pressure upon the persons processing the information
for release. On the other hand, the staged release is exactly right
to keep the attention-deficient world engaged.
I hope somebody is busily minting a Golden Leaker medal for Snowden,
and the others that will come after him (and against greater odds).

Probably not, but processing that pile of information is hard work.
I'm not privy to how much they're collaboratively deciding on the optimal
release rate, but there is an intrinsic dynamic to public attention, how
the signal is percolating through the network downwind of release, and such. It's far from being an exact science though, and on the surface, they seem to be doing an adequate job. How long the stash is good for is the interesting question, and whether there will be outrage fatigue. Also, once is something big enough it seems to cause less actionables, but somewhat of a state of quiet despair. I'm not aware a good way to
pierce that particular bubble.

Tor hidden services allow running Internet services while protecting the
location of the servers. Their main purpose is to enable freedom of speech
even in situations in which powerful adversaries try to suppress it. However,
providing location privacy and client anonymity also makes Tor hidden
services an attractive platform for every kind of imaginable shady service.
The ease with which Tor hidden services can be set up has spurred a huge
growth of anonymously provided Internet services of both types. In this paper
we analyse the landscape of Tor hidden services. We have studied Tor hidden
services after collecting 39824 hidden service descriptors on 4th of Feb 2013
by exploiting protocol and implementation aws in Tor: we scanned them for
open ports; in the case of HTTP services, we analysed and classified their
content. We also estimated the popularity of hidden services by looking at
the request rate for hidden service descriptors by clients. We found that
while the content of Tor hidden services is rather varied, the most popular
hidden services are related to botnets.

I might have been too paranoid about TrueCrypt (while we don't
know the details yet, we know that certain proprietary and open source
products as well as protocols and algorithms have been deliberately weakened by the NSA) as Snowden and Schneier seem to trust it but I went for dm-crypt instead of TrueCrypt for a new Debian install, for multiple reasons (history, license, mainline, full disk encryption support). If you're running a proprietary system, the weakest link will be
likely elsewhere.
For extra layers of tinfoilhattery you'd have to modify the hardware
(e.g. a FireWire port is wide open to a DMA attack, proprietary
blobs are a no-no for a trusted system, etc), but few people
bother to go that far, and if you're under that targeted a scrutiny
you have to bother about physical access you're somewhat screwed

They are likely monitoring all known exit nodes to see what's coming out (from the ISP level). I know most security tools have a "tor only" option, which is used for both illegitimate, and totally legitimate purposes (how does our network react to scans from some random country) etc. I've got to imagine that, in general, watching exit nodes is far more interesting than the rest of the internet. It doesn't mean that it's trivial for them to figure out who is attacking whatever servers, just that those servers are being attacked.

The way this article puts it, it looks like GCHQ started keeping records of anyone who encrypts their traffic, and then the Tor interface would probably be an index of connections to the Tor network.
While it demonstrates that they probably have a silly "people who encrypt are probably bad guys" mindset, that by itself doesn't break Tor.

That's true, I guess it's been known since the start of this NSA scandal that they prioritize encrypted traffic, so it could easily be a store of encrypted Tor traffic to store for later analysis (attempts at correlation or cracking, perhaps). But I guess not in itself a sign of successful exploitation.

Parallella Epiphany is soon shipping with a 85 kGate FPGA (Zynq 7020).
That's not an awful lot, but you can squeeze a small open core
in there, if you don't trust the ARM cores it ships with.
I don't know whether the FPGA is reconfigurable after boot,
if it isn't, you can load a verified blob with e.g. crypto
functions, allowing you to build an open hardware TPM which
runs outside of OS trust zone.

I run the system headless just for server (fax, mail, etc)
purposes, and I doubt Tor itself gives extra attack surface
to be remotely exploited. Putting into DMZ would be a good
idea, so at least the soft white underbelly of your LAN
doesn't get clawed.
Arguably, some systems considered obscure today
(Alpha, SPARC, PowerPC) add additional work for the
adversary, though no doubt the spooks have enough
exploit/shellcode libraries for such "obsolete" systems.

 Court ? Official statement part Posted on July 2, 2014 by Will
As seen possibly here, or here i lost the Tor case and was sentenced to 3
years probation (instead of 3 months jail) and all fees (court and experts,
Assumption ~30000EUR, not less than 20k for sure).
The sentence is based on ?12 which allows for anyone to be dealt with as
perpetrator (which is a pretty dictatorial law IMO) and this is based on that
i knew it *could* possibly be used for criminal activity (in this case child
I won?t write much more yet before i have the written ruling (i do not even
know my probation terms yet) but merely want to explain why i won?t appeal
this sentence:
First would be that I simply can?t afford it anymore, donations covered a lot
of lawyer fees but i had to use my entire money on this case as well, i?m now
bankrupt and the garnishment (a rare word, DE: Pf?ndung) of my income (to pay
the 20k+ costs) does not help with it either. I have high medical costs as
well besides which are more important. I?m not really interested in more
external funding due to taxation issues with larger amounts (and i do not
want *another* crime on me).  ? Second is that i just want to be done with
this, i had now years of ?issues? (i would write ?harassment? but then i get
sued again for sure) (Ex: Citing my boss to the police for questioning (x3);
physically monitoring my boss in Vienna; citing friends to the police for
questioning (x2); confiscation of bank transaction data; Polish extradiction
threats for hacking cases there (x2); citing me for useless questioning
causing lawyer costs (x5+) etc. etc.) ? It?s now finally over and besides the
cost i CAN live with this sentence, it does not show up in police registers
and won?t be an issue for work and alike in the future.  ? Third is the
mental component, this years of ?horror? changed a lot up to me being
hospitalized (x3?) with paranoid schizophrenia (which was a wrong diagnosis,
but still it?s not helpful if you HAVE to assume permanent monitoring of
everything), PTSD (among other issues) and now taking medication ? It took
it?s toll, including me getting fired for being in the clinic/sick stay for a
long time, i just can?t afford to loose my job or go the clinic again even if
i actually should be still there.  ? Fourth is the attention, media and
personal ? I don?t really like any attention on myself, especially when
others should get it (like some public cause, Pirateparty or alike).  ?

Jamming XKeyScore
Back in the day there was talk about "jamming echelon" by adding keywords to email that the echelon system was supposedly looking for. We can do the same thing for XKeyScore: jam the system with more information than it can handle. (I enumerate the bugs I find in the code as "xks-00xx").
For example, when sending emails, just send from the address "bridges at torproject.org" and in the email body include:
bridge = 0.0.0.1:443
bridge = 0.0.0.2:443
bridge = 0.0.0.3:443
Continue this for megabytes worth of bridges (xks-0001), and it'll totally mess up XKeyScore. It has no defense against getting flooded with information like this, as far as I can see.
Note that the regex only cares about 1 to 3 digit numbers, that means the following will be accepted by the system (xks-0002):
bridge = 75.748.86.91:80
The port number matches on 2 to 4 digits ([0-9]{2,4}). Therefore, bridges with port numbers below 10 and above 9999 will be safe. I don't know if this code reflect a limitation in Tor, or but assuming high/low ports are possible, this can be used to evade detection (xks-0011).
Strangely, when the port number is parsed, it'll capture the first non-digit character after the port number (xks-0012). This is normally whitespace, but we could generate an email with 256 entries, trying every possible character. A character like < or ' might cause various problems in rendering on an HTML page or generating SQL queries.
You can also jam the system with too many Onion addresses (xks-0003), but there are additional ways to screw with those. When looking for Onion addresses, the code uses a regex that contains the following capture clause:
This is looking for a string like " or " but the regex has no upper bounds (xks-0004) and there is no validation. Thus, you can include "goscrewyourself://o987asgia7gsdfoi.onion:443/" in network traffic, and it'll happily insert this into the database. But remember that "no upper bounds" means just that: the prefix can be kilobytes long, megabytes long, or even gigabytes long. You can open a TCP connection to a system you feel the NSA is monitoring, send 5 gigabytes of lower-case letters, followed by the rest of the Onion address, and see what happens. I mean, there is some practical upper bound somewhere in the system,, and when you hit it, there's a good chance bad things will happen.
Likewise, the port number for Onion address is captured by the regex (d+), meaning any number of digits (xks-0005). Thus, we could get numbers that overflow 16-bits, 32-bits, 64-bits, or 982745987-bits. Very long strings of digits (megabytes) at this point might cause bad things to happen within the system.
There is an extra-special thing that happens when the schema part of the Onion address is exactly 16-bytes long (xks-0006). This will cause the address and the scheme to reverse themselves when inserted into the database. Thus, we can insert digits into the scheme field. This might foul up later code that assumes schemes only contain letters, because only letters match in the regex.
In some protocol fields, the regexes appear to be partial matches. The system appears to match on HTTP servers with "mixminion" anywhere in the name. Thus, we start causing lots of traffic to go to our domains, such as "mixminion.robertgraham.com", that will cause their servers to fill up with long term storage of sessions they don't care about (xks-0007)
Let's talk X.509, and the following code:
fingerprint('anonymizer/tor/bridge/tls') =
  ssl_x509_subject('bridges.torproject.org') or
  ssl_dns_name('bridges.torproject.org');
Code that parses X.509 certificates is known to be flaky as all get out. The simplest thing to do is find a data center you feel the NSA can monitor, and then setup a hostile server that can do generic fuzzing of X.509 certificates, trying to crash them.
It's likely that whatever code is parsing X.509 certificates is not validating them. Thus, anybody can put certificates on their servers claiming to be 'bridges.torproject.org' (xks-0008). It's likely that the NSA is parsing SSL on all ports, so just pick a random port on your server not being used for anything else, create a self-signed CERT claiming to be "bridges.torproject.org', then create incoming links to that port from other places so at least search-engines will follow that link and generate traffic. This will cause the NSA database of bridges to fill up with bad information -- assuming it's not already full from people screwing with the emails as noted above :).
Putting the above code in a web page like this one will cause every visitor to trigger a search for TAILS in the XKeyScore rules. The more people who do this, the less useful it becomes to the NSA (xks-0009) in labeling people as suspicious. Likewise, putting tails.boum.org/<.title> in your webpages will cause the same effect, even when CSS/JavaScript makes such a title invisible.
In theory, the NSA should only be monitoring foreign traffic, and not traffic originating from the United States (or, apparently, the other five-eyes). So here is the fun thing (xks-0010): run your jamming tools from United States IP addresses against those servers in Iran you know the NSA is monitoring. Since the code should already be ignoring the traffic because it originates from the United States, then they can't complain if you've filled up their databases full of Tor Onion and bridge addresses.

@_subject: [tor-talk] potential leak on Torpedo 
Please read if you use/depend on Tor. Never before seen FH information.
submitted 16 hours ago * by Deepthroat2 [+1]
Hello everyone, I have some information that I have been dying to share for
months, but due to the circumstances, and to avoid detection, I had to wait
for some time before I was able to safely make this post. My goal here is to
provide information that I know is credible and for the Tor community to use
it as they see fit, due to the nature of my work, and the severe penalties
associated with breaking the rules and giving out information you aren't
supposed too, I have no way of verifying or proving anything to you that I
say here, I understand if find me less than credible, however, this is
essentially a PSA, and you can take it for what it's worth to you.
Just about one year ago, the Tor community was shaken by a Firefox exploit
which utilized a javascript exploit and an old vulnerbility in the Tor
Browser Bundle to unmask some users of Freedom Hosting. There has been
rampant misinformation, and speculation to the point that I felt like pulling
my hair out, or just simply bursting out into laughter when reading some of
the outlandish claims made by people who have little to no idea what they are
talking about. Today, I will set the record straight.
The FH exploit was a government engineered, and deployed exploit that was
designed in response to former Director Mueller's fustration at an earlier
child pornography case in which the FBI was ridiculed for being unable to
ascertain the source of child pornography, for those who aren't familiar with
this case, it involved a man who had accessed child pornography by accident
on a Tor hidden service, and then brought his desktop computer to the office,
explaining what had happened and that he subsequently preformed a "Full wipe"
on the disk.
The agent who took the report had limited knowledge about Tor, however, at
the time he knew that any directed effort to identify a specific Tor user was
hopeless, and in the report he indicated that "There is currently no known
way to ascertain the location of a Tor user, thus, no investigative leads
exsist." This got leaked to the press, and they had a field day, hinting at
the incompetency of the Bureau. Needless to say, the FBI had it's ego hurt
quite badly by this public display of incompetency.
Then Director Mueller directed the CEOS (Child exploitation and obscenity
section) to find a way to penetrate the layers of protection provided by Tor,
and to come up with a fesible way to conduct a sting operation in order to
bring these people to justice. The FBI had previously conducted a sting on
viewers of child pornography in a case out of Nebraska, that resulted in the
arrest of about 25 people. This was the first successful take down of CP
consumers that were utilizing a Tor hidden service.
One of the errors that I see alot on these forums and others was that the
Nebraska take down was done in a similar fashion to the FH exploit, with the
code being deployed onto the pages of the boards, however, this is not the
case. From my understanding, the Nebraska field office was able to find the
actual server, take it over covertly, then upload a series of files that
purported to be child pornography, but actually contained nothing but
encrypted gibberish. They were video files that were embedded with code that
called back to a computer that recorded the IP address of the requestor, date
and time similar to the way windows media player attempts to recall album
information and cover art for music cds and such. These were files that the
user actually had to download and attempt to open. This is why the service
was run for weeks, and only 25 people were identified as users. This method
was described by the techs who deployed it as a "NIT" or "Network
Investigational Tool".
Now for Freedom Hosting....
The javascript exploit could not be deployed directly on the servers which
Mr. Marques was using due to either technical reasons, or legal requirements
by the AUSA in Maryland. So the decision was made to clone the services
exactly, and transport then to the home of the FBI CEOS in the Greenbelt
division of Maryland. This location was picked specifically because
sentencing in this district for Child Pornography crimes is more severe. It
was July 31st of 2013 when the exploit actually went live, and tried to
identify criminals. It was installed previously, however, there were
technical problems early on and the code had to be revised 3 times before it
was running as intended, it ran for about 11 days before being shut down.
The amount of people identified by this exploit is still a closely gaurded
secret, with only agents having a direct "Need to know" being privy to this
information. Howver, the victory dance was short lived as news started
flowing around that the evidence may not be admissible in court, due to the
manner in which it was collected, among other reasons. Although proper
warrants were issued, it would take atleast 4-7 years to comb through the
list of suspects, and question, arrest each one. The major problem is that
after about 12 months, the courts start to presume your evidence is
prejudicial to the defendant because you're supposed to have an indictment
and serve it on the defendant within 30 days, and that just wasn't possible.
You can request an extension of this time, however you must present a new,
fresh reason for doing so..."We still aren't ready" doesn't cut it. There is
no statue of limitations for the crime of "Accessing with intent to view
child pornography" so barring any other limitations, the FBI can come after
someone 10-15 years later.
The AUSA became uncomfortable with the prospects of his legal case against
the exploitees of FH and went to the US Attorney. There was disagreement as
to whether or not the evidence would be viable, however, the operation went
on anyways. One of the victims of the FH exploit was a man by the name of
Grant Klein from Vermont. The Bureau had made arrangements with the local
police for assistance with the raid (This is pretty much standard operation
procedure, and is done for the saftey of the agents, as well as to maintain
professional courtesy. Local cops get butt hurt when you arrest people on
their turf without them knowing).
The FBI had provided the local police with court documents and the affidavit
of arrest regarding the cirsumstances of Mr. Klein's warrant, which they
promptly posted onto their press release against the wishes of the FBI. This
resulted in the termination of atleast one employee from local PD.
He was raided and before even being asked a question ,he began spewing a
confession. His home was searched, and a desktop computer with no hard disk
was found, as well a laptop computer belonging to his wife Susan. There was
no illegal materials found on these, however, he had a smartphone in the
drawer of a nightstand which contained illegal images of minors. He was
arrested and charged with 3 seperate crimes.
To make a long story short, the FH related charges were dropped because the
FBI had crossed a legal line by offering up child pornography de novo, by
shutting down the server, then bringing it back online hosting real CP. They
were uncomfortable with the prospects of this case, and were able to use a
leon good faith exception to admit the evidence they found on his phone to
make a single possession charge stick, however, he agreed to plead guilty.
The rest of the leads which lead to foreign nationals were then distributed
accordingly to the various LEA's.
Also, earlier this wekk, the UK police arrested 660 people as part of
Operation Notarise.
The operation name of the FBI takedown in Nebraska was "Operation Torpedo"
This was a cute poke at both the method they used, and the users they
Torpedo - Navy missile
Tor Pedo - Tor Pedophile.

Carnegie Mellon Kills Black Hat Talk About Identifying Tor Users -- Perhaps
Because It Broke Wiretapping Laws
from the questionable-legality dept
There's some buzz in security circles today after it came out that a session
at the upcoming Black Hat Conference entitled "You Don't Have to be the NSA
to Break Tor: Deanonymizing Users on a Budget" by Michael McCord and
Alexander Volynkin (both of whom work for Carnegie-Mellon University and
CERT) had been pulled from the conference at the request of CMU.
A Black Hat spokeswoman told Reuters that the talk had been canceled at the
request of lawyers for Carnegie-Mellon University, where the speakers work as
researchers. A CMU spokesman had no immediate comment.
There's been plenty of speculation about what's going on, but Chris Soghoian
has a pretty good thesis that the researchers likely didn't have
institutional approval or consent of the users they were identifying, meaning
that they were potentially violating wiretapping statutes. As he notes,
running a Tor server to try to spy on Tor traffic without talking to lawyers
is a very bad idea. While it hasn't yet been confirmed that this is what
happened, it certainly is a pretty sensible theory. Of course, none of that changes the fact that it's possible to identify some
Tor users. But... that's also not particularly new. In fact, we've discussed
in the past how the feds can identify Tor users. Tor adds an important layer
of protection, but there are plenty of ways that you can still be identified
while using Tor. Just ask Russ Ulbricht. The problem isn't so much Tor itself
but how people use it -- and the simple fact is that most people use it in a
way that will eventually reveal who they are. While it's not definite, it
seems likely that this is what the talk would have revealed. Shutting it down
wasn't any sort of big attempt to cover up this fact, but perhaps it was to
protect the researchers and CMU (potentially) from a lawsuit for violating
wiretapping laws.

Tor developers vow to fix bug that can uncloak users
Weakness was topic of talk abruptly pulled from security conference.
by Dan Goodin - July 22 2014, 8:15pm CEST
Developers of the Tor privacy service say they're close to fixing a weakness
that researchers for an abruptly canceled conference presentation said
provides a low-cost way for adversaries to deanonymize hundreds of thousands
of users.
The talk previously scheduled for next month's Black Hat security conference
in Las Vegas was titled "You Don't Have to be the NSA to Break Tor:
Deanonymizing Users on a Budget." The abstract said that the hack cost less
than $3,000 and could uncloak hundreds of thousands of users. On Monday,
Black Hat organizers said the presentation was canceled at the request of
attorneys from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where the researchers were
employed, as well as the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). The attorneys
said only that the materials to be presented "have not yet been approved by
CMU/SEI for public release." Researchers Alexander Volynkin and Michael
McCord have yet to explain why their talk was pulled.
Tor officials responded by saying that they're working on an update for
individual Tor relay nodes that will close the unspecified security hole.
"Based on our current plans, we'll be putting out a fix that relays can apply
that should close the particular bug they found," Tor project leader Roger
Dingledine wrote in an e-mail to Tor users. "The bug is a nice bug, but it
isn't the end of the world. And of course these things are never as simple as
'close that one bug and you're 100% safe.'"
He said the fix was complicated because the researchers didn't provide all
the technical details when privately informing Tor officials of the
"We've been trying to find delicate ways to explain that we think we know
what they did, but also it sure would have been smoother if they'd opted to
tell us everything," he wrote. "The main reason for trying to be delicate is
that I don't want to discourage future researchers from telling us about neat
things that they find. I'm currently waiting for them to answer their mail so
I can proceed."
In a previous e-mail, Dingledine said Tor developers "informally" received
some materials related to the vulnerability. He went on to say Tor officials
played no role in the cancellation of the Black Hat talk.
"We did not ask Black Hat or CERT to cancel the talk. We did (and still do)
have questions for the presenter and for CERT about some aspects of the
research, but we had no idea the talk would be pulled before the announcement
was made," he wrote.
CMU is affiliated with CERT, which coordinates security disclosures between
researchers and affected parties. A CMU spokesman contacted Monday didn't
elaborate on the reasons for pulling the talk.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tails vulnerability specific to I2P, not Tor 
SILVER BULLETS AND FAIRY TAILS
This week we made mention on Twitter of a zero-day vulnerability we?ve unearthed that affects the popular Tails operating system. As the Tails website states:
Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:
use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.?
This software was largely popularized due to the fact that it was used by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Since then, the OS has garnered much attention and use by a wide range of those seeking anonymity on the Internet.
We publicized the fact that we?ve discovered these issues for a very simple reason: no user should put full trust into any particular security solution. By bringing to light the fact that we have found verifiable flaws in such a widely trusted piece of code, we hope to remind the Tails userbase that no software is infallible. Even when the issues we?ve found are fixed by the Tails team, the community should keep in mind that there are most certainly other flaws still present and likely known to others.
Our customers use our information for both offensive and defensive purposes to better protect themselves and others. Providing a wide variety of exploit software we help penetration testers effectively test network security and incident response teams. One high profile example occurred last year when Facebook used a zero-day vulnerability to test their teams response to a zero-day attack. The information we provide is also leveraged in defensive purposes providing companies with well documented research for use in IDS and AV signatures for previously unknown threats. We at Exodus are able to do what many software projects cannot, perform security code audits and find exploitable vulnerabilities releasing them to the public.
The Vulnerable Component
The vulnerability we will be disclosing is specific to I2P. I2P currently boasts about 30,000 active peers. Since I2P has been bundled with Tails since version 0.7, Tails is by far the most widely adopted I2P usage. The I2P vulnerability works on default, fully patched installation of Tails. No settings or configurations need to be changed for the exploit to work. I2P is preconfigured so that all .i2p TLD sites are routed through the I2P network. At a high level I2P traffic is message based similar to IP packets. All communication is encrypted end to end with a total of four layers of encryption. I2P routers (end points) act as cryptographic identifiers, similar to a pair of public keys. I2P is a packet switched network, instead of circuit switched like Tor. This means transparent load balancing of packets across multiple peers. I2P is fully distributed with no centralized resources. There is no distinct separation of servers to nodes, this architecture helps eliminate single points of failure.
To lend credence to our claims we have created a video that demonstrates de-anonymizing a Tails user:
0:00:00,000 ?> 0:00:10,400: Demonstrating IP on listening server, Turning on listening server
0:00:19,000 ?> 0:00:25,400: Tails user visiting website icanhazip.com which shows the anonymized IP address
0:00:36,000 ?> 0:00:49,400: Showing that we?re indeed using the latest Tails build 1.1
0:00:50,000 ?> 0:01:03,400: I2P address being resolved, proof of concept malicious payload being delivered
0:01:30,000 ?> 0:01:40,400: Listening server retrieves the Tails user?s de-anonymized IP address (Austin RoadRunner ISP)
Note on Disclosure
Disclosure of vulnerabilities takes many forms, particularly their shape is adapted to the landscape that the platform is used upon. In the past at Exodus Intelligence, we?ve felt that significant vulnerabilities have been disregarded and have not had the requisite exposure. Through appropriate airing of the issue, we feel that users of such security platforms may come to understand the risks in base-level trust. Even further we hope to break the mold of unconditional trust in a platform. Users should question the tools they use, they should go even further to understand the underlying mechanisms that interlock to grant them security. It?s not enough to have faith upon security, rather to have an understanding of it. If the public thinks Exodus is one of a few entities finding bugs in software, they are grossly misinformed. As is the case with all vulnerabilities we report to vendors, we do not ask for any remuneration. All flaws that we give to vendors are given free of charge. All accusations of extortion perpetuated by those unfamiliar with our business model are completely unfounded. As of publication of this blog post the Tails team and the I2P team have both received all the relevant details and exploit code they require to remediate the vulnerabilities we?ve discovered.
Recently a high profile talk on de-anonymization Tor users was pulled from Blackhat due to legal issues. Their talk outlined with a budget of $3000 with some powerful servers and multiple gigabit links they were able to de-anonymize hundreds of thousands of users in ?a couple of months?. Exodus decided to pick up where this talk left off by letting the community know that there are many other vectors for de-anonymization. The vulnerability we have found is able to perform remote code execution with a specially crafted payload. This payload can be customized to unmask a user and show the public IP address in which the user connected from within ?a couple of seconds?.
Stay Tuned
Part two of this blog post will present a technical discussion of the vulnerability. This will be posted once we have confirmed the vulnerabilities in I2P are patched and have been incorporated into Tails.

I was curious for Monero dev's rationale to pick I2P over Tor, and then even forking I2P as Kovri.
Whatever I've seen online doesn't strike me as particularly convincing.
Is there published research in regards to deanonymization attacks against both Tor and I2P, and given the design changes of Kovri, should we expect the attacks to be easier, or harder? I realize that the answer would be likely we don't know, which is probably an answer in itself.
