@_subject: [tor-talk] Question regarding torifying applications 
Hi All,
I am new to TOR so I apologize in advance for asking any stupid questions :)
but I would greatly appreciate help on something I had in mind. I was
wondering if is it is possible to build an application using TOR for
anonymizing traffic from security applications like NMAP or NESSUS? if yes,
could anyone point me in the right direction or how to go about it.
Thank you all in advance.

Thank you grarpamp for your reply. Rest assured I am doing my research for
legit purposes. I am trying to see if it is possible to determine the
identity of an attacker if he uses these applications behind tor. There are
a few points I would like to understand. First, by bad performance do you
mean throughput, cpu performance or latency( how quickly the replies are
coming back). Also a socks proxy would not give the advantages of tor (as in
the connections switching every n secs)??. Thank you for all your help.

Yes. Use a SOCKS proxy or funnel all your traffic through
Tor with a packet filter. Many OS's deny LD_PRELOAD in
various cases, and raw packet generation doesn't apply.
Also, your performance will be absymal. Assuming for
the moment you're doing authorized/legitimate security
research, you'd be better off renting a commercial VPS.
As far as the specifics on how to do any of this, it's
pretty much outside the bounds of Tor, so check
with google or bing on that aspect
