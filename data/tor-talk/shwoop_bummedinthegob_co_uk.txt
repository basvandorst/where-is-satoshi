machine? Ubuntu? Linux Mint? Other? Why?
I have to concur with the debian branch of linux being top drawer.
I've been running a few nodes on debian servers for 1-2 years without the
slightest hiccup.
I used to run one on centos6 without issue but moved away as that was
simply to spend some time getting used to RHEL for job applications.
I hate to admit it but I still run ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop (main home
computer) due to the convenience of the bundled proprietary drivers, which
arch taught me I required for my wifi.
virtualbox/usb for my browsing needs (depending on my mood) although the
prospect of a dedicated whonix gate on my nas and virtual workstations for
my flatmate and I sounds fun.
I don't see you having any trouble with Tor itself so:
    * If your new to linux go for debian as a server or one of the
downstream distros if you plan to use a desktop ( mint, *buntu).
        * If you're versed with linux debian is still a great choice but
centos is rock solid and you can use it as experience as a
RHEL/CENTOS/Fedora sysadmin on the CV.
