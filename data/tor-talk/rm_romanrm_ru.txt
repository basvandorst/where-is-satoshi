anonymity and freedom on the internet, or do they want to use a proprietary

software developers as it can possibly be.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Guard flag vs relay bandwidth 
I am looking for ways to optimize several relay nodes to ensure maximum
possible bandwidth consumption. The actual numbers I have are within 20-50
megabits in one direction per node (i.e. not the gigabit-scale tuning discussed
in the FAQ).
From what I can tell the Guard flag affects routed bandwidth very negatively.
After getting the flag the bandwidth drops off sharply and a Guard node will
typically push an order of magnitude (TEN times) less traffic than a non-guard
one. This is confirmed by some blog and mailing list posts I found, mentioning
that a node will have its traffic drop after receiving the guard flag.
I wonder if can anything can be done about this. Can a torrc option be added to
set that a relay never wants to become a Guard; can the algorithms be tuned
so that Guards also keep receiving more 'casual' traffic (sorry if my
understanding is not consistent with how this actually works); or as a brute
hack should I reset my nodes' private key and fingerprint e.g. every couple of
weeks (but ramping up from scratch takes a lot of time and may nullify any
benefit from even doing so).

That would be great. :)
Yes I have read descriptions of the Guard flag, but to be honest I am not
convinced at all by the arguments presented in its favour.
To me it just seems to be an elaborate trade off that results in "if you
are f***ed, ensure you are f***ed as completely as possible and with the most
dire consequences possible".
"An adversary has a chance to see some of my entry traffic for some time"
...seems rather harmless to me compared to the Guards system's of:
"an adversary has a chance to see ALL of my entry traffic for a long period"
The nodes are far from being at network bottleneck, I mean b/w consumption in
terms of terabytes per month, since in most cases what I have is a bandwidth
arrangement where on a 100 Mbit or 1 Gbit port usage of X TB/month is possible
and this costs Y USD. Unused bandwidth from one month does not carry over to
the next, so it's suboptimal when a node only uses like 30-50% of what it could
have used that month.

Can you copy-paste what messages do you get. What do you mean by a "busy
signal"? Is this on a telephone? :)
Also how much RAM does your Plug computer have? As far as I know some
Pogoplugs had only 128 MB of RAM, and that might be a bit small for Tor (but
could be just enough since you aren't going to push a lot of traffic with that
CPU anyway).

Tor will work. But there is no Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) for ARM.
Compiling TBB from source is a different story entirely, and couldn't be
further from the clueless statement "it's for GNU/Linux so sure it'll work".
The only howto that seems[1] to exist[2], is infested with instructions to
download Windows .exe files for this or that, and for some reason even
suggests to install WinRAR, of all things.
Not to mention you're probably going to be building Firefox on a Raspberry Pi,
where you only have 256 or 512 MB of RAM, slow CPU and slow and prone to
dying from wear-out SD card for storage. And this means you will need to do
cross-compiling on a different architecture machine, which drives the
complexity level of the task another order of magnitude upwards.

So a random clearnet end-destination website can trace the client all the way

middle, but even about the entry node? And nodeS, i.e. all of them?*
Wow; can you explain in more detail how that works?
* (then a Three Letter Agency (TLA) can obtain lists of connecting clients
from all three Guards, and pretty much "triangulate" the actual source IP of
that user either to a bulls-eye hit or a very short list of IPs simultaneously
on all three.)
One more reason to abandon the Guard system altogether.

Following a dozen forums is a time-consuming hassle, but keeping up with a
dozen of mailing lists in a proper client with filtering set-up is just a breeze.
The best you will get from your proposed change will be something like Ubuntu
Forums, it's too often that when I google about some problem, I get a link to
those, and it's almost always some clueless newbie asking about a vaguely
similar problem, but getting no replies on their thread, or a couple of
even more clueless, useless replies. Seems like no one competent wants to
participate in forums, so at best you will get "the blind leading the deaf"
type of "communication".

I meant there is not only the Tor project in my (and others') life. There is a
great number of Free/Open Source projects, most of them have mailing lists.
Several of those I am personally subscribed to, and can follow and participate
in the discussions effortlessly. If all of those were forums instead, it would
have been a total unmanageable nightmare.

Well for one, because it will be kind of hilarious when you won't be able
to use the Tor forum/group/circle/whatever _via Tor_.
Google already does hassle Tor users with their constant captchas in the
search engine, I would not be too surprised if those centralized social
networks that you mentioned will soon ban all connections from Tor (if they
already didn't).

"The point" of what? -- and for the record, GMail Web interface uses HTTPS
(port 443), not 80.
If you don't want to run a 80/443 exit node, then consider allowing a number
of different ports except those, AFAIK exits are scarce enough that any port
that is used by people for anything that you can allow, will get used.
However if you run an Exit node without fully understanding legal and other
implications (and you seem to do just that), then by all means please don't :)

Virtually any provider will allow you to run a relay or bridge. Next to none
will allow you an exit; this is normal. VPSes start from $10-15/year (yes) nowadays, check and their forum for some offers and reviews.
In fact currently there's a discussion ongoing, what's I seem to notice is that more providers seem to become aware of the fact
that relay-only nodes are harmless, they won't bring abuse or land anyone in jail.
