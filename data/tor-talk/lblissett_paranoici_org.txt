more. If you r going to do that, you need to do some research on your

I'm not sure I understand the meaning of those expressions, but
Brazilian govt is most likely trying to bargain access to the data
systems, trying hard to be part of the "inner circle" of international
politics rather than caring much for privacy/openness.
People here bow to kapitol, leak it's shoes and dream of deep T it.
There was some political momentum - during which I noticed fb blocking
tor and undercover cops jamming wireless signals nearby street
protestors - and after that people are on a quiet mood. Many approached
me raising concerns, few adopted any means of protection at all and a
majority seems to think that these issues are no issues. (Subjective,
untrustworthy guess).
So fed govt does not have any means of political pressure (military,
economical, technological) and cannot count it's citizens to back up a
clearcut opposition to kapitol's peeping tom desires. That said, the
neoliberal right-wing journal "Estado de S?o Paulo" (estadao.com.br)
which has historical aliances with the elites of the homonymous State
has already started to give raise to manufactured news on some criminal
plot to kill the State Governor which was supposedly caught with the
help of hitech surveillance apparatus:
More context: PCC, for those who have not heard before, is an
brotherhood of inmates (prison detainees) born inside S?o Paulo's
prisons with the aim of fighting the ongoing day-to-day genocide of the
black people on Brazil. During the years they supposedly took control of
drug commerce and the govt and media are constantly reinforcing the fear
around these issues as they serve the same purpose here as terror-talk
on kapitol. There are, however, various info which suggests that
military under the Governor started an unlawful taxing system for
unlawful commerce as early as 2006 at least, but it probably goes back
way before. The State Government on S?o Paulo has remained on the hands
of the same political party for two decades now.

Point taken.
Nonetheless (1) Tor is more than a way to browse the web and you would
be missing that if you are just relying on a modded web browser to
connect to the Tor network; (2) the shared path on the network - AFAIK -
would not  lower individual users anonymity since it would
increase traffic diversity on shared exit node and individual users
would remain harder to trace even if someone somehow could correlate
that given traffic is most likely routed from your network (spooky spy:
"so, they are here right now - cuz we've seen such pattern before they
set up Tor or learned it somehow - but who is generating this specific
juicy traffic we're after? All 50? 49?..2? 1?") Also, whose pattern is
more easily grasped by peeping tom's? That of 1 or that of 50?
Sure, people constantly echoing the name of the private group or of it's
members would pinpoint the network exit router at specific times, but
how would big brother know that all the network is sharing the same
exit? Users dumbness, I guess, but Tor can't protect you from pushing
user identifiable data on the network.
So, if TBB is just modded FF, you could mod it yourself and replace
files on all machines. FF shall respect your previous configs when
But really, if those client machines rely on closed proprietary OSes,
why bother? You do not own those machines to begin with. Tor socks host
will give you an easy path to a place much different than that you think

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Can You Trust NIST? 
Yes/No. Yes, the same thing that happened there could happen to Tor
source code during it's development, that upgrades and new standards can
contain bugs, even malicious ones. That's why public development is so
crucial. We need random joe to be able of studying tech development in
order to have any minimal assurance that those evil bugs are not
intentionally left there by the bugger who sees those bugs as features.
No, or rather I don't know, this specific compromise of SHA-3 is not
meaningful to Tor. If tor were to use these algo to encrypt the traffic,
it would be just a matter of changing the algo to safer one. But then we
need to know the state of cryto algo's nowadays against math knowledge
and computing processor power. I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment
on this, but having to decide on the lack of this knowledge I guess we
come to a need to rethink our "trustees" and support them somehow.
The other path is to devel your own cripto system which does not rely on
public available standards. That wouldn't mean it's unreversible, but
would mean it's not reversed yet by the time you start using it.
Security by obscurity they call it.
BTW, is there any consensus on kryptos sculpture meanings?

Both expressions are somehow misleading. What do you mean "open"? If you

you have to consider that in most countries there is a fee attached to
internet access so it's not public in the same sense that streets are.
If you mean "well, accessible provided that you have access", then you
should consider that the internet is filtered to great lengths and so
there is no clear map of what is accessible till you try to connect.
Also, you should consider that the internet != web and that even if we
consider the web only, there are factors such as nameserver
completeness, websites that have private portions + public ones,
websites that require certain software & | hardware to provide ordinary

The Law is always referred to past experiences, but it is used to think
and manage present situations. It has some similarity with code, but
it's interpreter is human, not machine, and is always capable of
producing output in unexpected ways, with no correlation to changes in
Law text input.
So the problem as I see it, is not adapting the Law to nowadays needs,
but preserving our rights on the net as much as outside it. And this
problem is huge since we couldn't maintain much of our rights in the
traditional world. The old interpreter is kept old and always tends to
be part of the conservative minority of our kind.
The net presented itself as a possibility to change our traditions, but
power structures showed themselves much more willing to maintain and
expand their control over netcitizens who just wish to open windows to
dreams and forgetfulness.
