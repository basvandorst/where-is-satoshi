Hey everyone,
I'm Sathyanarayan, one of the few students who have been selected for the
Google Summer of Code to work on Tor. I'm a second year CS undergrad at Anna
University, India.
I will be working with my mentor, Nathan Freitas, on improving Orbot and
extending ORLib. I will be improving the Orbot UI/UX, and adding several
features such as data statistics and also implementing the TorCheck API. At
the moment, ORLib is very minimal. I plan on extending the library and also
creating an ORLib enabled app as a sort of primer for other third party apps
to follow. More details can be found on my proposal[1].
This is my first year participating in Google Summer of Code, and I'm
terribly excited to be part of the Tor community. I've set up a blog on my
site[2], and I'll be blogging on a frequent basis to let others know of my
progress. Also, I'm usually idling on OFTC and FreeNode (nick: gsathya).
Please feel free to drop me a line if you have any comments/ideas on my
project or if you?d just like to say hello!
Thank you,
