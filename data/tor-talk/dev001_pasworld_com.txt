Compressed packets that outs of client to Tor server are not the same
packets that arrive in the Web ser server decompressed, different
The problem is that can overload Tor server.

In some cases when OS version or architecture are not popular, I think
that browser HTTP request can be bad for anonymity.

@_subject: Playing with the TCP traffic. Stupid question. 
One simple and stupid question.
Tor encrypt traffic, how?
The ISP can say that any machine of the network is a spy machine proxy.
Where is Tor server?, clients ask.. and spy machine reply: here.
Uses tor any out of network based system (PKI for example), to see that
spy machine really  is not the destination Tor server?
What about software package integrity?

@_subject: About number of users connected to tor servers 
About number of users connected to tor servers.
And example:
10000 users connected in a country, Linux , Konqueror, Galician
language, hour of use 17:00.
ISP's can know who is connected to Tor servers, OS, (Browser, Language,
and hour, clear traffic)  +
Info in HTTP headers (OS, Browser,...) +
Language of client +
Activity of packets per client +
= ?
For example:
Of 100000 only 0.4% uses Linux = 400 users
Of 400 uses Konqueror 2% = 8 users
Of 8 users only 3% Galician = 0.24 users
And hour more definition ...
Have anyone statistics of how may users is usual connected in a country?
