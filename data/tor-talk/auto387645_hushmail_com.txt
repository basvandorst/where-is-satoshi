@_subject: Making Google Angry 
This is in regards to A while back, I found advice that users could increase their security using Tor by having programs run on their computer that would use the Tor Network, so it would be harder for another individual monitoring traffic to tell if the user was actively using the Tor Network or not; such a program would make it look like the Tor Network was constantly in use by the user.
So, in my search to create "garbage" traffic, just any useless, random requests I could have some program send through the Tor Network, I found and used the "TrackMeNot" extension for Firefox.
Now, I can only assume Google, along with any of the other search engines, don't appreciate this, but it was intended as a quick fix, and it seemed to serve the purpose I wanted it to fulfill.
The downside being that while I'm probably not causing all the Google errors people are encountering, it seems as if I'm probably causing quite a lot of them. Before I tried this, I occasionally got an error from Google; with TrackMeNot enabled, I ALWAYS get errors when trying to search on Google.
So, I'm still looking for an alternative: a program that would send random garbage data across the Internet through the Tor Network, but that wouldn't cause any harm.
Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks in advance.
