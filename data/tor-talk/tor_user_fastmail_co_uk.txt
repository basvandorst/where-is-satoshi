I tried this out, but I'm sad to report that TorK couldn't
find my Tor server instance at all.  Absolutely nothing appeared
in any of the windows.  Nor was there a green onion icon like
there was supposed to be.

@_subject: Tor configurator 'complete' - needs testing 
Hello all.  I have (hopefully) pretty much finished all the basic programming for
the Tor Configurator (torrc configuration file generator) at:
It seems to be have OK and produce valid results.  I would appreciate it if anyone could take a few minutes to troubleshoot
the script with various permutatios of input and check for any visibile
errors or incorrect results.
PS: I have decided to keep the format of the questions the same; they
seem all that likely to confuse, IMO.  - tor_user

I'm not sure what you mean.   Do you mean if they use the page to
a script and then later use Vidalia to re-configure it at a later date?

@_subject: Problems running TOR for an extended period 
I supposed you could get cron to restart the tor service hourly, or
as a workaround.

Hello.  I've created a (hopefully) simple to use torrc generator
using PHP.  The link is here:
It is still very much in alpha; I would very much appreciate feedback
on UI, logical correctness, and any other problems or issues which
you think could be improved.

@_subject: Torrc configurator 
Hello, and thanks for the feedback.  It is much appreciated.
The object of this web page is indeed to make it as easy as possible
to get a tor server or client up and running as easily as possible. Of course, you can run a client out of the box, but running a server
needs a bit more configuring.  I am trying to make it as easy as
and the least intimidating as possible so that we can encourage people
run more tor servers to help out the network.
I take your point, Steve, about perhaps phrasing the server?/client?
in a different way.  Does anyone else agree or disagree that this would
easier to understand for the average user?
Also.  I could easily include logging, but do you think the average
user will look at tor log files?  Remember, this page is aimed at
getting non-technical users up and running as quickly and easily as possible.
I welcome your thoughts,

How would I do this server-side?  It's not really feasible for me to
run nmap from the server.  Can it be done in PHP?  Or did you mean,
perhaps, directing a user to, say, grc portscan so they scan their
own ports?
