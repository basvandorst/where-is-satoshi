@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems installing Tor on my server 
I already asked this question via the help address, and was redirected here.
I'm trying to install Tor on my Centos5 server.  I have been running an old
version of Tor as a relay for several years, installed via yum from one of
the Centos repos.  I realised I wasn't doing anyone any favours by running
an old version, and decided to upgrade.
I'm encountering errors, and wanted to know whether this is because tor now
requires Centos > 5, or there is a simple solution to what I am seeing, or
perhaps there is some problem with your repos.
Here's the detail.
I added a repo to yum using the repo file described at
name=Tor experimental repo
name=Tor experimental source repo
When I do `sudo yum install tor` I get the following output with error
 2.9 kB     00:00
 4.1 kB     00:00
[Errno -3] Error performing checksum
Trying other mirror.
 4.1 kB     00:00
[Errno -3] Error performing checksum
Trying other mirror.
Error: failure:
from tor: [Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.
Any ideas?
