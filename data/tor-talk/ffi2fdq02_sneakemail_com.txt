Hi, My questions relate to this excerpts from
1)  "allow local connections to port 8118 and port 9050"
     Maybe I'm missing some subtlety in the word 'local' but does this mean incoming, outgoing, neither or both should be allowed?  As far as I know, I haven't allowed either port incoming or outgoing and yet tor client seems to be working.
2)  "outgoing connections...  ports 80, 443, and 9001-9033"
     I've allowed outgoing connections on all (only) these ports.  Why does tor still regularly make attempts at other ports.  I blocked them all and the tor client still works.  Is there any advantage to allowing these too?  Is there a definable range?
My setup comprises:
  OSX 10.3.7,
  OSX built-in firewall (incoming blocking),
  Little Snitch 1.1.1 (outgoing blocking),
  Tor v0.0.9.1,
  Privoxy 3.0.3

Thanks for getting to this amongst everything else Roger.
On 05/01/2005, at 7:19 PM, Roger Dingledine arma-at-mit.edu |or-talk|  My suggestion FWIW is "if your firewall can limit your machine's  ability to connect to itself then ensure that such connection is  allowed on ports 8118 and 9050."  I understand the catch-22 about  "people who run them..." and I think it shall remain a catch-22 unless  it is to become a multi-page document in itself.  Whilst I don't run  one of those firewalls I'm probably close to that class of people and  I/we simply have to have the initiative to search and question until we  understand.  Otherwise we can simply wait until technology like tor  matures to the point where anyone can use it without having a clue what  they're doing:)
Nice.  Completely answered thank you.
It's not something I would like to see 'fixed' at this stage.  There's  simply a trade off here.  I don't wish to spend much time on security  but I value it.  Therefore I block all ports except those I *know* are  being used by services I desire.  Consequently it suits me to block  everything else.  If my need for anonymity rose then I may trade that  off against this easy but overkill approach to security.
No.  Thank you!:)
