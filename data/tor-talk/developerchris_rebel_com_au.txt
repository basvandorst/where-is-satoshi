I haven't been following this conversation so please excuse me if I am covering old stuff here, but this situation is something I have been very concerned about since the silk road was busted. I found the excuses given as to how the silk road was busted as far far too flimsy.
My knowledge of TOR is severely limited but I have a major concern about TOR and the number of nodes.
Given the following...
     A bomb threat is considered a terrorist activity
     Tor was a US military project
     Tor was funded until very recently by the US military (possibly still is under guises)
     As we have recently discovered The US/UK/Australian etc governments have no qualms in spying on everybody and everything and using illegal means to do so.
     The above lie outright.
     Tor has very few nodes, what ~4k+ How many of those nodes are directly military, how many nodes have been subverted, by well, anyone with an interest in TOR and the know how (read military). A timing attack in my opinion is more than just feasible it is very likely.
If the FBI/NSA used TOR to track down this person, a potential terrorist. Would they be honest about it? Obvious answer NO!.
Is TOR safe?
Put it another way. If I was the military I'd be very keen on subverting TOR and then using every means at my disposal to deny that I had done so.
The very people TOR  is designed to protect probably don't have enough knowledge of TOR to use it safely. I asked an acquaintance the other day, a technically wise person. "How many nodes do you think TOR has?" His answer "Oh I don't know, Millions!?"

I'd agree with you except evidence points the other way. There is now plenty of evidence to suggest that back doors are placed in products even if it renders the end product less secure. In other words for these government agencies, being able to spy is more important than being protected from spying.
Being open source does not guarantee safety. The nodes can operate well within design and still give away a wealth of information, which is exactly what a timing attack relies on. Even then we know that there are weaknesses in open source random number generators put there very deliberately. The open source community did not wake up to it for a long time, and more recent surprises courtesy of Edward Snowden.
How many open source projects are exploited on a daily basis? the only advantage open source has is, if it is popular enough (if you are lucky) and the exploit is found out soon enough (if you are diligent) the a patch will possibly be made quickly. But not always. I dont live under the illusion that because its open source its somehow inherently safer. Quite often the opposite is true.
I joined the TOR mailing list to discover more about TOR for the purpose of creating hopefully many more TOR exit relays. On learning more and from the experience of a friend when he tried to run an exit relay I realised this was not a wise thing to do. Not at least unless you are experienced and prepared for the probable consequences. As my plans involved many innocent helpers I decided the risk was far too high.
I was advised on this mailing list perhaps to create bridges instead, but that made my whole project of dubious worth so I canned it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A question about hidden services and tor in general 
I just reviewed the tor hidden services page. so I am pretty green about the way it works.
 From the description I gather this
When a client wants to connect to a hidden service an introducer picks a random rendezvious point which then is used to shuttle packets back and forth between the client and the hidden service.
If I wanted to discover the location of the hidden service is it not simple to act as the rendezvious point? If I had enough resources and flooded tor with nodes eventually one of my nodes would be chosen as the rendezvious point and therefore I have the client IP (me) the rendezvious point ip (me) and the supposedly hidden services ip (target).
Then to cover my tracks I spread a story about how the target left clues in facebook pages etc etc..
How does tor prevent this type of attack?

I got to speak with my acquaintance about his experience. Sadly It was as bad but not as quick as I was told.
He told me within a three week period of setting up the tor exit node he considered his entire internal network compromised as several of his machines showed signs of being compromised. I didn't get to ask the specifics of that. But knowing this person as I do when he says compromised, it is not something you take lightly.
He reformatted and rebuilt every machine from known good sources and sworn off Tor.

Yes precisely. So if you considered running a caching exit node it would only be sites that are safe for you the exit node operator to run
Obvious ones are non copyrighted and non copyrightable stuff like the Gutenberg project I think Wikipedia has a policy that is amenable and there would be thousands of others.
Of course torrents, kiddie porn etc would not be considered safe.
This is the main issue that I see. I agree with you here one hundred percent. but if we are to persuade sites like the gutenbergproject not to directly block tor exit nodes then I am not sure what else can be done?
Exit nodes by their nature must look at your request. Whats to stop an exit node modifying the response now?
As is currently done. Its not cached and it cant be. end of story
But in the end its just a thought.

It's a nice idea to suggest he joins the list.
I'll drop the hint, but this guy is not one to participate in online discussions in any meaningful fashion. He is very security conscious and does not have any form of traceable online presence as it is. But he may come in under a pseudonym.
Irrespective of his experience, one would be rather foolish to presume being within the Tor network doesn't open you to some sort of hactivity. Its like painting a big red target sign on your back and governments around the world will be trying to infiltrate any machine connected to Tor.
This is particularly obvious in the light of Snowden's revelations. Oops keyword! Did I mention my old car. Its a real old bomb (nuther keyword :)
Perhaps he was targeted in a sloppy manner and thus discovered the attacks. For my part I take him at his word. And to be honest we are unlikely to get much more than that out of him, he would consider anything else a security Please keep the replies civil. I know there is one in every crowd.

I hate to say it that gives me no confidence at all. Only the randomly chosen guard at the HS end needs to be compromised and the whole chain becomes worthless. A timing attack will reveal all. But there are better ways and far more reliable ways than a timing attack. Your diagram has crystalised a thought that has been running through my head for the last day.

This knowledge is trivial to obtain, a timing attack isn't even necessary. Whether that represents a true risk I haven't yet determined. I need to consider what surety one can have that the guard is not compromised.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New to list and questions about exit nodes 
Hi all I am new to this list and to TOR in general
Recently I have been thinking about creating a TOR exit node, but my discussions with other people now make me concerned.
An acquittance of mine created a tor exit node, I know little detail more than that other than he was banned by services such as skype and ebay. and apparently the machine he used was hacked. Now I know he is very security conscious and not a newb. If he was hacked it was by professionals. He is a network engineer.
Apparently he pulled the exit node and wiped the machine.
This leaves me initially thinking no way. And I was always concerned about the legal implications of being accused of some crime or another because as an exit node, my IP is associated with that activity.
Rather than change my mind and not set up exit nodes. I decided it would be worthwhile to ask for the advice and experience of those involved more heavily in the TOR network.
How do you deal with these issues and others that arise from being a part of the network?

Thanks Michael
Yes he was running it from home. Ok so that's a bad idea, I can certainly see why.
I thought the best way to help Tor (nod to Eugen) was to become an exit node.
Does it aid the Tor project to have more relays, or is there enough of them?
How does the Tor project increase the number of exit nodes?
How does the Tor project deal with potential liabilities arising from running exit nodes?
I assume when you say 'bridge' you mean not an entry or exit node (thus Oh and I just wanted to send a shout out to all the spooks monitoring this conversation :) or is that a bad joke?

Hi Roger
Thanks. I need to confirm the story as I got it through a third party. What you are suggesting is a rooky mistake. If he says he was compromised I can tell you for sure he was compromised.
I will see him in a few days so I'll ask him directly.
I appreciate the links. I am trying to come up to speed in double quick time. I have some pretty big plans where I hope to convince lots of people too join Tor. but I cannot in all good conscience, if it opens them up to any form of abuse or excessive risk. I must also be able to explain what those risks are. The people I am appealing too are good hearted not network My initial reaction was to dump my plans but decided hearsay was not a strong enough reason, I needed to know more. Perhaps I should not have put as much faith into the words of the third party.
Oh and I just noticed. I meant acquaintance not acquittance damn spell

@_subject: [tor-talk] duck duck go 
Someone mentioned duck duck go as a search engine
I have used this in the past and the thread reminded me so I thought I would give it another go. I installed the duckduckgo search into firefox's search engine list.
Seems as thought DDG was not happy when I decided I didn't like the results and went back to the evil empire 3 (1 and 2 are taken by microsoft and apple)
Anyway I just did a search on google and DDG popped a search result into googles results. NOT COOL!
So as a warning if you don't like that sort of thing don't go with DDG they are vying for 4th place.

No not directly related to Tor but was the subject of some discussion a few days ago. I didn't see you pop your little note into that.
Yes I agree it was an extension that was installed BUT in my defense I used the "get more search engines" in Firefox's  Manage Search Engine List.
I was not expecting and probably did not pay enough attention to the fact it was actually installing an extension rather than just a search engine string.
It seems Firefox is now using extensions to provide search engine results. Not Cool either.
Caught once won't be caught again.
Oh and yeah its privacy related I don't like extensions spying on my search....

@_subject: [tor-talk] Project Gutenberg 
Project Gutenberg wouldn't block proxies without good reason. The trouble is without knowing the reason its hard to find a fix.
One possible reason hinted in the message is they have bandwidth issues. Which raises an interesting thought. Interesting to me anyway.
Could exit nodes act as caches. I know that would introduce a number of issues including a compromised exit node revealing what was retrieved by that node (but not whom for) so if it was limited to a few popular 'safe' sites it could help alleviate those sites from some of the traffic burden.
This is only an idea. Perhaps a bad one but I just wanted to float it if it hasn't been floated before.
There is probably a number of Tor users who cannot get access to illegal books such as the bible or ones about democracy or even science fiction through any other way than Tor. It is a shame to see such a repository behaving that way.
