I was looking through the Tor's overview homepage and I understand for
Tor to build a path, it must first obtain a list of Tor nodes from a
directory server. I like to ask how can I trust the directory server
in the first place? Can my govenment set up such a server and give me
a list of government owned Tor nodes instead? Surely she can redirect
all traffic (if the IP address of the Tor's directory server is
hardcoded into the Tor client) from the Tor's directory server to her
own server?

Dear all
I like to ask what is the encryption level for Tor? I cannot find it
despite searching. Is it better than Gmail's AES-256 256bit?

Hi everyone
Thanks for all the reply. I will consider using some of the mentioned
techniques, maybe a live-cd to defeat key logger. I like to ask
another factor that may affects one's anonymous status.
I am currently using Privoxy with Tor on Windows XP to make my
connection anonymous. As I do not wish to filter my web browsing, I
cleared the following three files so only "Main Configuration" has
some parameters in it.
Default Actions
User Actions
Will this actions affect my anonymous status or it still remains the same?

I cannot find the parameter "hide-forwarded-for-headers". Is it in one
of the files I had cleared?
Anyway, my masked IP was tested to be a Tor node from the detector.
Can I conclude that the 3 files can be safely cleared without
compromising on my anonymity?

Hi all!
I am a political blogger in a sensitive country and I would like to
try out TOR to make my blogging anonymous, as recommended by Reporter
Without Borders (RSF) in their handbook. I understand that with TOR,
there is little chance of the government tracing my original IP
address when blogging. However, I have reasons to believe that my
Internet connection is under constant surveillance and since my
"blogging" from my PC to blogger.com is sent in clear text, what would
TOR help me in this case? Is RSF assuming that the government has no
access to its citizen's connection?
