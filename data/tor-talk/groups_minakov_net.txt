@_subject: Tor trademark question 
I have found and read this trademark faq:
And I have a question. I develop commercial software which uses Tor client.
I would like to place any graphic designation like "powered by Tor" to show,
that the software uses open standards. What can I do and what I should not
to do in connection with trademark rights?

@_subject: Circuit question 
I have a question about the circuit construction. The "getinfo
circuit-status" sometime returns response without any exit nodes. Which node
used as exit node in this case?
And sometimes program with traffic goes through tor shows IP that belongs to
exit node which not listed in circuit status. Why?
Sorry for my English. Any information will be really helpful.
Tor 0.2.0.28-rc

@_subject: Exit node's IP 
Hello all,
Is it possible for controller to get current circuit nodes IPs through
GETINFO command? The "getinfo address" shows local ip instead of current
exit node IP, I think its useless.
