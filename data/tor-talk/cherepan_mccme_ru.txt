Hi Scott!
Ok, I cannot guarantee that he is happy about technical questions:-)
But he clearly toalks about non-technical points.
Sure. But only while he keeps his political views for himself and doesn't bring them to this list.
Just to be sure: you talk about banning Skype? No problem here, it's a valid concern, it's in the news, in the press, on TV etc.
The problem is the rhetoric such as quoted at beginning of this mail. OP started the thread talking about bloody regime. IMHO it already is beyond the acceptable line. But then he continues about killed people etc. in the following mails. That very much brings the politics to the list and adds nothing to the technical side of discussions.
One doesn't need to wait for additional reasons to switch away from Skype. It's proprietary and closed technology with all accompanying problems. BTW last news are about eBay possibly closing Skype entirely which is quite in line with its proprietary nature. So no question If someone is concerned about possibility of banning Skype or VoIP in general s/he can start with research how VoIP is banned in those countries in which it's already banned. There are some examples in
 .
BTW it seems Google Voice can be used to hide origin of phone calls in some cases.

Hi Andrew!
I've just checked Torbutton doc and the situation turns out to be more intricate. There is an option in Torbutton which turns memory cache off (extensions.torbutton.block_cache, see
 ). The reason is probably to avoid tracking via stored unique identifiers (item 5 in  ). So the question is whether caching is acceptable from anonymity POV.
When using the cache in Firefox the issue could be mitigated by SafeCache plugin. External caches are harder to defend (maybe checking referer could help?).

Hi Praedor!
It's a matter of terminology. I hope we all (subscribers of this list)
can agree on some technical goals such as anonymity, untraceability,
privacy, access to blocked sites. This is relevant for design of Tor, its operation, configuration of Tor, Privoxy etc. Call it political or OTOH discussions about government, is it totalitarian or is it behind some journalist murders etc., are very flammable and adds _nothing_ valuable to technical side. If you have better term for this instead of 'political' please propose. Maybe 'non-technical'?

Hello, Scott!
You wrote to or-talk at freehaven.net, "Vlad \"SATtva\" Miller"  on Sat, 25 Jul 2009 06:59:43 -0500 (CDT):
I'm sure that Vlad is happy to see the ongoing discussion of technical questions raised by the OP. He just asked to keep political FUD off the list. And I'm completely agree with him, IMHO unfounded (and founded probably also:-) talks about bloody regime are not for this mailing list. YMMV.
As for banning Skype in Russia, AFAICT it's FUD also. Everything seems to be based on some discussions in The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (just hysterics by mobile operators loosing market share?). It's somewhat troubling but I'm not sure it's worth much discussion until there are some concrete details.
What the OP proposes is also somewhat strange. Build the possibility to "call to ordina[r]y telephones" into Tor? Sure, just add some PSTN exit nodes...

Don't know about Tor Fox's style of usage but one of my setups is a firefox without plugins with javascript turned off going through tor via privoxy. Is torbutton really needed in such a setup? The only problem I can immediately see is css-only history stealing.

P.S. Probably of interest to tor community:
New paper by Amit Klein (Trusteer) - "Temporary user tracking in major browsers and Cross-domain information leakage and attacks". The
paper is available to download from the following page:
User tracking across domains, processes (in some cases) and windows/tabs is
demonstrated by exploiting several vulnerabilities in major browsers
(Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and to a
limited extent Google Chrome). Additionally, new cross-domain
information leakage, and cross domain attacks are described, which
provide a foundation for attacks such as "in session phishing".

Every tor user should know that his/her traffic will definitely be sniffed

through tor unencrypted or to ignore ssl certificate mismatch warnings
there is nothing ethical tor operators can do about it.
So the question is not about sniffing some traffic to gather statistics but whether the fuss about embassy passwords and pages like this:

The main discord here seems to arise from totally different approaches to the question. You are building a whitelist while default tor exit policy is a blacklist. IMHO it's hard to constructively discuss amending blacklist from whitelist POV.
Sure it is valuable but AFAIU tor is not there to bring order back to

I agree more or less. But there are some concentrations of troubling traffic on some ports such as 25. Blocking exit to these ports is a compromise. It is not ideal -- good traffic is also lost in the process and not all bad traffic is blocked. Tor exit node operators that feel balance should be different can change their exit policy Do you have better apporach?

I just want to say that ports should not be blocked before there is hard data about the nature of the problem.
I don't see how port scanning can be responsible for such disproportinal use of port 43. My guess is that it's whois traffic. Maybe someone tries to rip whois database for some reason. Or some public whois lookup service routes their requests through tor. Or phishers search for good domains. Or malware fighters try to find Conficker domains. Who knows...
Suppose someone wants to bypass request rate/ip limit of whois services. Should it be blocked, in your opinion?
This is interesting because it refutes that it was whois traffic originally. But without ccTLD it's hard to say.
IMHO at least destination ip addresses should be analyzed. I don't run tor node so cannot help here, sorry.
Quick stat from my cached-descriptors.
Total number of routers -- 1747.
Number of routers with policy "reject *:*" -- 742.
Other router are as follows:
  policy          #       lines   lines/#         max     max2
  whitelist        708    14806   20.91           621     36
  blacklist        297     4733   15.94           315     52
  total           1005    19539   19.44
Whitelist policy is a the one ending with "accept *:*". Blacklist policy is the one ending with "reject *:*".
There are two outstanding routers. First, che with 621 lines of policy containing a long list of banned ips. Second, your MYCROFTsOtherChild with 315 lines of policy. All other exit routers have exit policy with <=52 lines with the average of about 20 lines.
Just some food for thought.
Hm, I have just tried mailx on FreeBSD 7.0 and it adds In-Reply-To:
header to replies. heirloom-mailx does it since 2001. So is it a problem with your setup, additional hardening or what?
But please fix it anyway.
And while we at it, please don't send me personal copies of your answers, sending it to the list is enough. According to  , "you cannot post to the mailing list unless you subscribe first". So everybody you are answering on this list will get your reply through the list.

Hi Roger!
While you are at it maybe you can also fix something to eliminate duplicate mails in the list? Sometimes there are series of mails addressed like this:
  To: or-talk at freehaven.net
  Cc: or-talk at seul.org
which go through the list twice.
When subscribing everything talks about seul.org, e.g. majordomo is at seul.org and confirmation mail reads:
  Someone (possibly you) has requested that your email address be added
  to or deleted from the mailing list "or-talk at seul.org".
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
But then mails from the list contain:

Maybe just replace or-talk at freehaven.net by or-talk at seul.org here?
