@_subject: Monitoring tor's bandwidth use. 
I haven't found documentation on monitoring how much bandwidth tor is using or how much tor has transferred in a given time period. I can set limits in
torrc but that's about it.
How do I ask tor how much it's transferred today/this week/this month/ever?
Is there a way to see what throughput my tor instance is doing?

@_subject: Stable Tor Debian package poor performance. 
I installed the stable Tor Debian package which ran fine for a while until it consumed all CPU on my system.
My load average was approx. 25 and the machine was quite sluggish. It took several minutes to login and several minutes to issue each shell command.
After killing the few dozen Tor processes, I installed the experimental Debian package and am running that
with no CPU use issues thus far. I didn't do much troubleshooting with the stable package because I figured
tracing a bug on such an old version would be a waste.
I'd recommend updating the stable Tor package as it seems to be quite out of date and may people will default
to using that.
