There wasn't really anything remotely deleted here. You just reloaded the page and the script was not sent again, right?
What's far more worrying however, is that the code you put on Pastebin doesn't look like it belongs on this webpage. To me it looks like some code to track your geolocation. Either the website itself or the Tor exit node (or perhaps even some other attacker in the middle) tried to inject some code here, I guess. When you restarted Tor Browser, you probably got a new curcuit for the site and thus a new exit node.
Perhaps it's a good idea, to not disable the add-ons which are supposed to protect you from malicous JavaScript code, if you just ran into some malicous JavaScript code.
You don't just by a chance know, which exit node you used for that site when you got the code, do you?

Such an attacker could insert some JS or cookies etc. to track a user around the web or more dangerous attacks like stealing user data. The possibilities of JS are far-reaching. In the worst case scenario, JS can be used to exploit a user's device and gain priviliges within the OS. Such an attack has just been discovered last month on this mailing list right here.

You always need to allow some input as well in order for the Tor guard node to talk to your computer. Stateful Inspection is used for this. Here's a complete ruleset to accomplish what you asked for. All output is allowed, but no input, except it belongs to some output your computer previously did.
# Stateful inspection for input and output
iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
# Allow loopback traffic
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# Reject any other input
iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT
# Accept all output
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT
Note that you also want to accout for IPv6 using ip6tables. It depends on your network though.

This has nothing to do with Tor. It's just the general way how the IP protocol works. Without allowing stateful input, you couldn't do any useful traffic. You always need to make sure that there's a way to the destination (output) and a way for the target server to reply to you (input).
But using stateful inspection, only input that is a reply to your output is allowed. There should't be any security risk because of this. It's what your home router is doing as well to allow the servers you want to talk to to See also:

Well, given the way OP phrased his question, I just assumed he wanted to prevent any unwanted input to his system, which is why I gave him a simple ruleset which allows any output.
If you want to filter output as well but allow Tor Browser to work, I see two ways to accomplish that:
- Go with the seperate user method: Create a seperate user just to run Tor   Browser and allow output for just this user. You could launch Tor Browser as   this user using gksudo or kdesudo.
- Configure a bridge for Tor Browser to use and allow output to just this   bridge filtering by IP adress as well as port.

Onion addresses use Base 32.

This is probably more complicated since there's actually a 1024-bit-RSA key behind this domain.
While this is certainly not easy to brute force yet, next generation onion services will be quite a bit more secure in this regard. See below.

If "anyone / anything has full r/w/x permissions" in /home on your system, you're doing something very wrong. Only the individual users should have write permissions in their own home directories.

It should look something like this:
$ ls -lah /home/
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x  3 root      root      4.0K Dec 23 11:33 .

drwxr-xr-x 52 user      user      4.0K Apr 12 09:15 user
For the rest of this email, I'll assume that you mean "/home/user" when talking about "/home".
What? Do you mean like...web pages having access to the files in your home directory? That's not how web browsers work. A web page should never be able to just access files on your system. If something like this was possible, it would be considered an exploit. Not just with TBB, but with any browser. JavaScript is a sandbox and must be so.
Right, as long as you don't talk about web pages. They don't have any file access in general.
Both methods (putting apps into global dirs vs. putting them into home dirs) have their own advantages and disadvantages. With globally installed apps, you can install updates for every user simultaneously and it saves disk space. On the other hand, it requires a privileged user the always keep stuff up-to-date, whereas with the other method, non-privileged users can perform their own updates themselfes. You need to keep in mind that there are many multi-user systems out there, where some users simply don't have root/sudo

Look, if you have malicous software running on the system with normal user priviliges, you are in big trouble anyway. There's so many things that malicous software could do even if TBB was installed at a non-writable location. Just as a simple example, malware could just change the location in your TBB desktop and launcher links and still trick you into launching malicous software. That's just a really silly example, but the point is that once the malware is running, it is too late. Storing software in non-writable locations is such a small useless mitigation technique in contrast to what malware could do. I agree that putting TBB to /opt would give you a tiny bit of extra security. But for the price of the user not being able to install updates, that might just not be worth it. Having software being stored in central directories is not much of a security feature.
BTW: The user profile of TBB would still be located in the home directory. It would have to be. Malware could insert malicous stuff in there too like custom Tor circuit settings, browser setting, NoScript rules, Add-Ons... You get the

The problem with this of course is that you need to trust a third party: The Internet Archive. Unless you have some checksums of binaries or - much better of course - the Tor developer's PGP keys. If you have some way of verifying what you download, this circumvention method might be a good idea. But if not, it's a little bit risky.

I2P's protocols are quite unusal and should be relatively easy to block by using DPI. On top of that hosting the bridge servers might me a little more work as it requires some extra firewall rules for that, if I'm not mistaken.
I2P's protocols have some problems in some networks anyway. The SSU protocol isn't even compatible with a SOCKS proxy, let alone HTTP proxy.
I2P protocols: I2P is probably also not the easiest thing to implement due to it's complexity and it's currently only implemented in Java, which is not exactly a good basis for a pluggable transport.

Please read the docs: Encrypted HTTPS connection with a false SNI (ajax.aspnetcdn.com) readable for the censor, but the actual destination hostname (meek.azureedge.net) in the HTTP "Host" header. This way there's an encrypted connection to the CDN which looks like a browser's HTTPS connection to "ajax.aspnetcdn.com" from the outside. Once connected to the CDN, the meek client can talk to whatever app within the CDN it wants to. It will talk to the meek server (meek.azureedge.net), which IS a Tor bridge and as such acts as the entry guard of the circuit.

Many of these users have no choice but to use Tor, like those ones living in a country where Facebook is censored.

I get that Tor Browser by default is supposed to be friendly for the average user and it does this on Android and on a PC with the default settings quite However, people who know what they're doing can really tweak TBB on a desktop to their specific needs, like using a system-wide Core Tor instance or saving browsing history.
Are there any plans to bring some features like this to TBB for Android? Or are there even ways to do these things that I'm not aware of? For example, Orbot is already quite battery-hungry as it is, but running two Orbot instances all the time for browsing while torifying some other things really ain't that great on a smartphone.
