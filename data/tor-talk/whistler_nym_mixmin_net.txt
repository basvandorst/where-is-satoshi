@_subject: [tor-talk] Use of socat and tor-resolve with Tor 
I have been using socat to torify connections.  Since I was unsure
where a network address was being translated, I supposed that I could
avoid the issue by first using tor-resolve to translate the address to
a numerical IPV4 address, and then pass that to socat. I have now been told that this use of tor-resolve is unnecessary, and
am hoping that a knowledgeable member of this list will confirm or
deny this, and perhaps explain what is going on. To be specific, I have been using:
SERVER="`tor-resolve news.mixmin.net`"
socat TCP4-LISTEN:${LISTEN_PORT},bind=localhost,range=127.0.0.1/32,fork \
  SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:${SERVER}:${PORT},socksport=9050 > ${TMP}/socat_log.$$ 2>&1 &
whereas it has been suggested that I just use:
socat TCP4-LISTEN:${LISTEN_PORT},bind=localhost,range=127.0.0.1/32,fork \
  SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:news.mixmin.net:${PORT},socksport=9050 > ${TMP}/socat_log.$$ 2>&1 &

Thank you for your prompt response.  If you, or some other
knowledgeable member of this list, would help with some additional
socat questions, I would appreciate it.  Given the frequency of posts
about dns resolution, perhaps others would benefit as well. Recalling that the socat call was:
socat TCP4-LISTEN:${LISTEN_PORT},bind=localhost,range=127.0.0.1/32,fork \
  SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:${SERVER}:${PORT},socksport=9050 > ${TMP}/socat_log.$$ 2>&1 &
The questions are:
1. Shouldn't we also include
in the long socat line as well?
2. I have studied the socat man page, but still cannot figure out what
are doing.  Can someone explain, or point me to an explanation?
3. In order to connect to $SERVER over Tor, the dns resolution has to
have already have occurred.  Which system is doing this?  Is it the
Tor exit node?  Is Tor exit node communicating with yet another system
that does the dns translation to numeric IP address?

Yes, risueup is quite tor-friendly.  They even have an entire help
page devoted to it:
I notice that you are posting from riseup.  They have some excellent
help pages.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is privoxy required with locally compiled Tor? 
Although I occasionally run Tails when a live CD is required, and Tor
Browser Bundle when I run on a system with a proprietary OS, I
principally run on an open-source system, using a tor version locally
compiled from the source distribution.  This allows me use lynx,
instead of Firefox, which I consider to be more secure. I had been under the impression, from perhaps a long time ago, that it
was necessary to run privoxy as well in order to prevent DNS leaks (or
for some other reason).
My questions are:
1. Was that ever true?
2. Is that true now?
3. If privoxy is no longer needed to prevent DNS leaks, is this
because the exit node now handles the DNS lookup? 4. What was the bug-fix in Firefox 6 that removed the need for privoxy
with Firefox, and what is the status of this issue with regard to
lynx? The documentation on the torproject website that I have been able to
find which mentions privoxy is:
which follows:
I need an HTTP proxy. Where did Polipo go?
In the past, Tor bundles included an HTTP proxy like Privoxy or
Polipo, solely to work around a bug in Firefox that was finally fixed in
Firefox 6. Now you don't need a separate HTTP proxy to use Tor, and
in fact leaving it out makes you safer because Torbutton has better
control over Firefox's interaction with websites.
If you are trying to use some external application with Tor, step
zero should be to reread the set of warnings for ways you can screw up.
Step one should be to try to use a Socks proxy rather than an http
proxy -- Tor runs a Socks proxy on port 9050 on Windows, or see above for
OSX and Linux.
If that fails, feel free to install privoxy or polipo. You can use
our old polipo config file if you like. However, please realize that this
approach is not recommended for novice users.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle version info 
Thank you for providing the Tor Browser Bundle.
I just downloaded the latest Tor Browser Bundle, 2.3.25-4.  Before
attempting to upgrade, I tried to check to see what version was
currently installed.  I went to:
which told me that I was running FireFox 10.0.7.  I clicked on the
'Check for Updates' button, and was told that I was up to date.
But I am not up to date for my TBB, so this appears to be a misleading
assurance.  I am up to date for the underlying FF version with TBB is
using, but then, that is always the case, since TBB uses its own FF.
I then brought up my FireFox browser directly, and found that it was
18.0, and used to the 'update' button to update to 19.0.
So, the FF versions that TBB is using are old (which is to be
expected), but the information that 'About' gives me is not the TBB
version (which would be useful), but instead the version of the
underlying FF (which is not useful).
So my question is:
1. Is there any way to interrogate a running version of TBB to find
out what the version number is?
By the way, the platform is an iMac, running OSX 10.7.5.
I suspect I am running version 2.3.25-1 of TBB, but I don't know how
to verify that (hence this note).

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is up with: tails-i386-0.17.1? 
A script that I run to check for new releases found a version of tails,
tails-i386-0.17.1, located at:
But when I go to to find it, that directory is not there.
When I go directly to the directory for 17.1, it is there, and has a signature
file and iso file.  The signature file is a real signature file but the
iso file consists of html saying that there is no iso file.
What is going on?
