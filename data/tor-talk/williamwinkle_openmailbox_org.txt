Thanks for the video link - most illuminating. I suggest that everyone watches it.
The Freedom Hosting issue was mentioned at 24 minutes in. AIUI, in the Freedom Hosting case, the host owner was arrested in Ireland which allowed the FBI to control the sites that he hosted as they had access to his computer. The FBI used an exploit that fed the IP of vistors to some or all of the FH sites back to the FBI. The exploit was based on a patched Firefox vulnerability and required the client to be using JavaScript. In other words - users that had updated the TBB or those that did not but did not use JS were uncompromised when they visited any of the FH sites.
In other words, the weak link (if there ever is one) is not Tor per se but the Firefox component of the TBB.
Is that correct?

This is presumably dependent on the TBB having a vulnerability. So, even if all users of target_website.com were considered evil and should be targeted, this could only happen if a) there was a 0-day for Firefox on which TBB is based or b) there is a known vulnerability for Firefox but certain users did not bother to update.
The injected code would only be able to discern the client's real IP if the malware was successfully deployed and that would require the TBB to be compromised.

With all the talk about the N_S_A targeting traffic between exit nodes and destination websites, I am wondering how this may work for hidden services (.onion domains). There are no exit nodes as everything occurs within the hidden services network.
How would it be possible for an adversary to learn that Person X rented a Tor hidden server from a hosting company that provided .onion domains and hosting (assuming that Person X paid for his/her hosting with Bitcoins and did not do anything stupid to tie his or her 'clear web' identity to his or her .onion identity)?

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Bruce_Schneier=27s_Guardian_Article_about_N?= 
I recently read a Guardian article from last October ( by Bruce Schneier about the N_S_A and Tor. His story was based on the "Tor Stinks" and "Egotistical Giraffe" presentations.
My understanding of the article is that if individual(s) are requesting  then, once the request leaves the exit node, the N_S_A can use their Quantum servers on the Internet's backbones to redirect the request to their FoxAcid servers in order to compromise the requester.
I don't understand what Schneier means by this:
"After identifying an individual Tor user on the internet, the NSA uses its network of secret internet servers to redirect those users to another set of secret internet servers, with the codename FoxAcid, to infect the user's computer."
Surely the whole point of Tor is that the requester of  cannot be identified based on the traffic which leaves the exit node. Since the N_S_A would only know the IP address of the exit node and the destination  how can the client be identified even if the traffic is redirected to the FoxAcid servers?
Indeed, the previous paragraph appears to contradict the paragraph quoted above:
"The very feature that makes Tor a powerful anonymity service, and the fact that all Tor users look alike on the internet, makes it easy to differentiate Tor users from other web users. On the other hand, the anonymity provided by Tor makes it impossible for the NSA to know who the user is, or whether or not the user is in the US."
Therefore, the N_S_A can redirect traffic that leaves the exit node to the FoxAcid servers but how could they send back a response to a specific Tor user?  Or have I misunderstood the article?
