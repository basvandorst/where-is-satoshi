thanks for looking into this.
would you be willing to disable CAPTCHAs for Tor users to make donations work out of the box?
(people that don't know how to workaround that problem will simply fail to donate)
here is how you can disable CAPTCHAs for Tor users:

Ok, the mystery is solved why this happening. CloudFlare presents a CAPTCHA, it is solved, then CF redirects the request using a GET instead of the original POST. So, the donation button will never work properly if a CAPTCHA is presented.

@_subject: [tor-talk] why the torproject should get another bitcoin partner 
If you ever tried to donate to the torproject via torbrowser and bitcoins you probably
know that it does not work very well due to bitpay using Cloudflare. Cloudflare changes
the original HTTP POST to a HTTP GET -> 404 Error.
from BitPay Support Center (Apr 25, 9:33 AM):
To answer your question:
"would you be willing to disable CAPTCHAs for Tor users to make donations work out of the box? "
This was my first request to BitPay management. The answer was no. I then asked if we could offer a payment button that worked through Cloudflare and the answer was "not at this time".
I am very sorry to bring you this news. This issue is also very important to me personally. I think people should be able to donate bitcoin to the Tor Project from the Tor Browser without jumping through hoops, but this is the state of things at the moment.
thanks for checking in.
