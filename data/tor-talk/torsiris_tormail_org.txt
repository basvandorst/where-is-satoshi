Is there anything to worry about if using curl with the below configuration?
(I don't want to use a virtual machine)
Only debian-tor can go online:
iptables -F OUTPUT
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m owner --uid-owner debian-tor
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -o lo
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -p udp --dport 123
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
curl is used like this:
curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 -A "TBB's user agent" -C - -O
I guess there is no way that curl can leak the real IP address. Any

iptables -P OUTPUT DROP will drop anything not allowed in the above rules.
I don't see the need to add more rules for DNS. They get dropped anyway.
That's a good point for outgoing traffic. :-)
I see no way how curl could get the public IP address without root
Thank you Ondrej for your point of view.
