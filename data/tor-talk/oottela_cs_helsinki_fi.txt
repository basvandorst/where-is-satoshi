@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Messenger 
For configuring Pidgin/Adium/ChatSecure for OTR E2EE and Tor routing, see
If you do this, make sure to register your XMPP account via Tor Browser. It might be a good idea to create the account under Onion Service XMPP server. This should prevent you from accidentally registering/logging in without Tor. You can find a list of servers at
However, it's better for security if you use messengers that are onion-routed by default. Consider taking a look at
Ricochet - Really convenient and easy to use, v2 onion services, cross-platform support for Win/Mac/Linux.
Briar - Android only, lots of interesting features like blog and forums built on top of the messaging protocol.
TFC - Less convenient (lack of GUI among other things) but high-end crypto like X448-XChaCha20-Poly1305, v3 Onions by default. Also has hardware based endpoint security. If you don't need that, the "local test" configuration is still usable on one computer although it looks a bit silly. Has file transfer and group conversations. Linux only.
