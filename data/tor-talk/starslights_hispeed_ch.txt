I have same problem on Windows seven 64 bits, Tor windows 0.2.2.7aplha.
I have found the cause, on windows it's seem due of a wrong path , tor search Geoip on wrong folder.
I have copy -paste the Geoip-cache in the right folder and have renname it as After that it have worked.
I hope that's will help and i will report it if needed.

@_subject: What can see a server of a Bittorent when I contact with it through Tor? 
Well Tor are not made for the protocol bittorent and it will hurt the network, you can only use Tor to communiacte via the tracker, who will see the exit relay ip but your peer will done in direct from your pc to the pc connected to you, so see your true ip. You must look about i2p or BitBlinder projects for such things

Well i am not sure but look like you must first upgrade your Tor version to the last sable minimum 0.2.1.24 who i think will first fix the "        xx:xx:xx [WARN] Rejecting insecure DH key [0]
        xx:xx:xx [WARN] DH key must be at least 2."
I am not 100% sure about that but pretty sure. A devs will for sure rightanswer you :D
