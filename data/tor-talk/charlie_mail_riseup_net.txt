I have seen tails sync the clock with UTC just after a network
connection and start browser. How does it do so. It is the ntpupdate ?
How can it sense the net connection ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How can start vpn over tor ? 
I have both tor and openvpn running.
How can I run openvpn over tor ?
Should I create an iptables rule to force all
traffic through tor and then start openvpn ?
In that case what would be the iptable rules ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How can start vpn over tor ? 
I am always interested and taking ideas from whonix. But it's vmbox issue
keeping me away from it. I understand a virtual machine is working as a
protective layer, but it is too much for a client PC. The whonix gateway
running on a dedicated box will give some relief but as a standalone
system, where user travel a lot, is problematic if the machine is not very
powerful. A service which just
-> apply macchanger
-> apply utc
-> start a tor
-> tor dns at /etc/resolv.conf
-> apply strict firewall
-> and then start a vpn over tor
-> finally a check mechanism to test everything
-> periodic vpn check and auto reconnect
seems an alternative to secure the ***existing running system***
The vpn sees the tor exit node.
When you stop that service, the system goes back to insecure nature again.
Ideas are welcome.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor breaks after applying firewall 
Hello all,
I have install and run tor natively in ubuntu and also set
127.0.0.1 and the dns is running fine.
If I then apply my firewall ping failed and no access to internet.
Moreover tor breaks after some time with the following error
[notice] Tor has not observed any network activity for the past 71
seconds. Disabling circuit build timeout recording.
[notice] Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:0. Giving
up. (waiting for circuit)

up. (waiting for circuit)

Surely it is a iptable issue. I am giving it here. Can anyone suggest what
breaks my access ?
