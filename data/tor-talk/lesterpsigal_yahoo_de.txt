@_subject: ff 1.5.0.7 & 2.0 (remote) dns leaks when using tor 
hi there,
i've got a setup for anonymous browsing using firefoxf 1.5.0.7 and
lately ff 2 with privoxy and tor (vidalia bundle 0.0.7) on windows xp sp2.
the ff configuration option 'network.proxy.socks_remote_dns ' is set to
true, the setting 'network.proxy.failover_timeout' is set to 50000 and
the 'network.proxy.socks_version' is set to 5 but the ethereal logs show
that firefox is still leaking dns requests, i.e. ff still does the
lookups itself and does not delegate them to the proxy (which is not
quite true: the dns requests are always delegated to the proxy and
_sometimes_ to the local dns client too).
to make it worse the leaks are occuring randomly (sometimes the remote
dns works and sometimes not), so i'm guessing that it is a timeout issue.
does ff fallback to local dns lookup when a remote lookup request is not
answered in a timely manner or is it a failure with the os dns client or
even a ff bug?
what else could be done to prevent ff from dns leaking?
any hints or suggestions would be very nice as it does not make any
sense to me to operate a quite complex and complicated system for
anonymous browsing when tracking of dns requests is all
a profiling facility has to do...
p.s. i've already posted the same message to the the mozillazine ff
general forum without getting an answer

thanks for your reply, you're right that i'm quite worrying about such
an issue and felt slightly irritated as well...
what i've forgot to mention that my installation of firefox uses
torbutton 1.0.4 which is a firefox add-on preconfiguring the proxy
settings for the vidalia bundle, that is http/s: localhost:8118
and  socksv5 localhost:9050.
that's alright so far.
i was wondering if i got a special problem with my installation or if
that is a problem of a more general type, but according to the  feedback
and other (non-existent) postings it must be a special one, or perhaps a
lot of people are thinking they surf anonymously but still leak their
dns requests...
anyway, i've tried to solve the problem more systematically:
i've cleared the cache, tried some web addresses and checked the
ethereal logs and it turns out that with the
settings mentioned above on each url a local udp dns request occurs,
while the tor log reads:
Nov 16 14:07:08:052 [Notice] fetch_from_buf_socks(): Your application
(using socks4a on port 80) gave Tor a hostname, which means Tor will do
the DNS resolve for you. This is good.
one log entry for each request privoxy makes.
this must be wrong because i'm using mozilla thunderbird with the
torbutton  add-on too (same settings). over here no local dns lookup occurs
and the tor log entry reads:
Nov 16 14:26:24:434 [Notice] fetch_from_buf_socks(): Your application
(using socks5 on port 995) gave Tor a hostname, which means Tor will do
the DNS resolve for you. This is good.
which means thunderbird connects directly to the tor client and speaks
socks v5 (and not socks 4a !). the dns query is resolved via the
circuit as intended...
so i was expecting that firefox does the same: first resolve the dns
name via the socks 5 tor client and then retrieve the http/s content via
then, i've tried different settings:
setting ff's 'network.proxy.failover_timeout' to '-1' or '0'
-> no change
(if a timeout occurs privoxy shows up with one of its error pages)
leaving socks proxy line blank in ff's connection setting
-> no change
setting all proxy protocols to privoxy port
-> no change
disabling dns client service on win xp
-> no change
disabling 'forward socks4a requests' directive in privoxy configuration
-> no change
also, i've recognized that the local dns queries are occuring when there
is an direct user interaction with the browser like entering an url,
selecting a bookmark, clicking a link etc. while requests from websites
(when loading a page) seem to be resolved remotely (they do not show up
in the ethereal logs but are requested in privoxy and log'ged by tor).
unfortunately, i don't know if ff resolves dns by an own internal
resolver thread or by delegating to the system which makes the whole
thing worse.
so, usually i'm not easily frustated but over here i'm really missing a
thing and i would not wonder if its a little configuration tweak i
forgot about...
any advice is welcome...

yep, that's it.
thanks everybody for "puttin' my nose on the right trace"... ;-)
i was right assuming that i missed a 'simple' configuration tweak and
i've made the wrong assumptions about how firefox add-ons work ( i
wasn't aware of the fact that those extensions may override ff's general
configuration settings like 'network.proxy.socks_remote_dns' or the
general proxy settings...).
i'm using several add-ons  and  when  looking on them, it is obvious
which one to disable first in order to check for those local dns
lookups: it's a add-on called 'showip', version 0.8.05, which looks up
ip addresses for any entered url and shows those ip's in ff's status
bar. a quite handy and useful tool but not compatible with using
tor. i've disabled the add-on and everything works out fine, i.e. no
more local dns queries.
i will contact the author of the add-on for further investigation and
will post a follow-up if any useful information about those issues of
dns leaks are yielded.
i would suggest that the maintainers of the following sites should get
asked about including a note or warning about the possible side-effects
of the mozilla add-ons on dns leaking:
to drive even further: wouldn't it be good for any potential firefox/tor
user to know which of the add-ons are safe (in regard of tor
compatibility) to use and which are not. as there are now about 1000
add-ons from which to choose this means a lot of work and checking
(although there are add-ons which do not have any effect by design)
but wouldn't it make sense to collect any experience users have made
with certain add-ons and provide those results on a web page, e.g. the
noreply wiki. if there is some task to do, i will offer my help whenever
i've got time to do so ('though my programming capabilities are quite
i've worked out a simple example showing some add-ons and their
compatibility in tabular form at
you even find there a logo for tor compatibility (heh, heh, heh, isn't
that serious but most probable that's the way the mozilla guys would end
up to...) but there is some seriousness about that thought that software
you use in cooperation with tor should/could be marked as good working
or as not compatible ( this would make sense especially with browsers,
plugins/add-ons, newsreaders, mail or chat software...).
very nice would be some cooperation with the mozdev team (or any other
(open source) development team) to reach a guideline for socks/tor
compatibility within the development process. but, i guess, that's still
a long way to go...
anyway, meanwhile i will enjoy one of the best ideas in
'counter-intelligence on digital exploitation and surveillance
of  human web-activity'.
again thanks a lot

@_subject: A case for SSL specialist programmers 
i don't think there are hidden information streams, e.g. encoded ip
information, build into ssl as ssl is based on tcp as the transporting
protocol. but there could be issues when you use client certification
in the case your client certificate contains location information.

@_subject: Blocked by Websense 
wouldn't it be good to have tor keep track of some routers in
'last-known-good-working' circuits plus a bunch of
'average-best-working' routers  and keep those in a cache from
which tor starts up from to make the first connections to directory
servers through those or's.
for example from my dialup connection tor uses always the same few
entry servers to start building circuits (i guess those with the
lowest latency), so it would not make any difference (in regard of
predictability) to keep these routers locally cached and fetch the
directory information through circuits composed of those servers.
i know there are some problems with such functionality like
- initial startup (e.g. on a fresh installation)
- startup after a long period of inactivity (cache becomes outdated)
a solution to this could be the establishment of permanent tor servers
which are used to bootstrap from...

does somebody know a good working, freely available

and can provide me and the forum with her/his experience?
comments like 'write your own!' are very welcome i'm

what's going on with the or network when all on all circuits always
the same exit node is established (when strict exit nodes is set but
the node in question is not in the 'white-list' of allowed exit nodes)??
thanks for suggestions

thank you very much for the fast reply,
indeed, it did look strange too me and i've never seen such behaviour of
tor before as for every circuit closed a new was established with the
same exit node again....
p.s. sorry, for the wrong posting, actually it was meant as new topic
     and not as a reply to the thread it is now
