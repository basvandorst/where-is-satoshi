You might want to expand on exactly what you mean by 'anonymize', because  every mobile phone (and SIM card) has a unique identifier that is required  for the phone to be able to make and receive calls via the cellular  Exactly what activities do you to be anonymous from who? e.g. web  browsing, phone calls, your movements while the phone is on, data brokers,  law enforcement, etc.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on OpenBSD 5.6 
Look, I just get fed up with people being dismissive pricks, both to  myself and newcomers. The guy came in asking for help, I'm trying to help  him with some steps to build and install from source that have been  tested, will work, and will provide the newcomer with a current versions  of Tor and LibreSSL which are free from known bugs and vulns.
Compare that to:
"Yeah, why using a port/package when you can do everything manually?
Have fun OP."
Did you even test the above, because I have, and it's not 'easy enough'.
Firstly, very high probability that new user is going to get stuck at the  'confirm PGP sig' step.
Secondly, changing the version number in the Makefile, updating the  version, sha256 and file size values in distinfo yields a port that FAILS  to build with the 0.2.5.12 release.
Now the newcomer (who is having difficulty installing Tor from packages)  is in a position where they have to start learning the OpenBSD software  porting process and debugging build failures of the ports system. This is  supposed to be helping them out?
So 'strange attitude' aside, yes I'll be contributing steps which I've  tested myself, that actually work, and don't leave users with outdated  version of Tor and LibreSSL that contain bugs and vulnerabilities.

I didn't make the claim, I just linked to it. If you want to challenge the  claim, best take it up with the person making it.
I think he makes a good point in this slide however.
* VPNs provides _privacy_
* TOR provides _anonymity_
* Confuse the two at your peril

Not certain if the deal is still being offered, but for quite a while you  could get a free TLS/SSL certificate good for one year when registering or  transferring a domain to namecheap.com
Then if you needed to renew it, or just buy more, you could pick them up  for $2/yr just by purchasing another qualifying product, such a year of  whoisguard for $2.88.
Point being, the cost of certificates can be negligible if you know where  to look.

That's a damn fine questionp. My guess without doing any testing would be  'no' as well.
During the four step order process, you are presented you with a selection  of administrative domain email contact addresses where you want the  approval and delivery emails sent. I believe these are pulled  automatically from the registered domain(s) in the account. It's been a  few months since I've run through the wizard so I can't remember exactly.
I wouldn't touch StartCOM with a ten foot pole myself, but other people  seem to like them. The whole certificate authority business is a joke, but  whaddya do. We're held hostage by this oligopoly of web browser software  I think projects like DNSchain are the way to resolve most of the problems  with DNS and encryption certificates.

a drivers license or open a bank account, license plate readers

I would think than an organization like Padmapper would have the technical  and financial wherewithal to build out their own network of scraper nodes  apart from the tor network.
This would be almost impossible to block especially if they stood up the  infrastructure on a large cloud providers where instances could be  re-provisioned with new IP address in numerous cities all over the globe  in a matter of minutes with a click of the button.
It used to be that craigslist page loads via Tor were just painfully slow,  which could have been a rate limiting strategy to combat scrapers, now  they just ban it all together.
I'm curious why Craigslist doesn't just sell their listing data via API  access to companies like Padmapper, that would be a win-win.

If your goal is to setup a relay on OpenBSD, why are you downloading the  linux version of the Tor browser bundle?
I think you might want to start with the source tarball here instead:  Also, consider updating LibreSSL to the latest 2.1.6 version before  compiling Tor.

I can see your point. For a newcomer visiting the download page, it would  not be entirely clear which version to download for use with *BSD.
Here's some commands to get you started
mkdir /usr/local/src; cd /usr/local/src
ftp -o -   cd libressl-2.1.6; sudo ./configure; sudo make check; sudo make install
sudo rm /usr/sbin/openssl /usr/local/src/libre*; sudo ln -s  cd /usr/local/src; ftp -o -   | sudo pax -rvz
cd tor-0.2.5.11; sudo -s; env CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include  LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure --disable-asciidoc --sysconfdir=/etc;  make ; make install
sudo cp /etc/tor/torrc.sample /etc/tor/torrc; sudo vi /etc/tor/torrc

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on OpenBSD 5.6 
Forgot to add that the source version of tor does not install a service  script in /etc/rc.d.
So create one like this
$ sudo vi /etc/rc.d/tor
# $OpenBSD: tor.rc,v 1.1 2011/03/11 06:49:55 ajacoutot Exp $
ulimit -n 4096
. /etc/rc.d/rc.subr
rc_cmd $1
Then make it executable
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.d/tor
Plus you'll probably want to add a dedicated tor user.
Sometimes I just cheat on that step by adding the outdated tor package  then deleting it, the user will be left behind.
$ sudo pkg_add tor; sudo pkg_delete tor
also you'll probably need to create a data directory and log file for tor:
$ sudo mkdir /var/tor; sudo touch /var/log/tor; sudo chmod -r _tor:_tor  and add these lines to /etc/tor/torrc

The version of Tor that installs from packages with the release version of  OpenBSD 5.6 is 0.2.4.22. It's sheer madness of course, but OP might  actually want to run a current version of Tor.
Doubling down on the madness, they might even want to understand how to  build and configure it from source so that they better understand how it  If the user really wanted 'click on this big shiny button to install Tor  you mouth-breathing idiot' option, I don't think they would be choosing  OpenBSD as their operating system.

Another idea (hat tip to Blockchain.info support) is you can take the  visitor's IP address, and at the time of connection, check the list of tor  exit nodes (somewhere like here:   ), and if it matches, redirect  them to your own .onion site.
You can visit blockchain.info from any Tor connected browser to see it in  action, works beautifully.
