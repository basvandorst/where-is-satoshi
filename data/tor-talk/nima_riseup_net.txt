@_subject: [tor-talk] Mapping SVN usernames to Git 
Hello lovely humans,
[resending this email to the broader community, sorry if you got this
email twice. Also, thanks to those who helped with updating the pad :]
If your username is listed below, it means you've committed to
Torproject website for at least once, and I don't have your git name and
email on file. I need this info to nicely map your svn/git username to
keep track of old changes, when we move website to git.
May I ask you to take a moment and either update the pad or reply to
this email off-list, please?
I'm gonna wait till Tue and put "unknown author " for
those remained unknown by then.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy 0.1.3 released - Our fourth beta release! 
Awesome! I've been waiting for this release for so long.
Yeah, I've translated TorBirdy into Persian long while ago but as noted,
lack of having Thunderbird in that locale, makes it pretty much useless.
However, helping Mozilla's (partially non-existence) Farsi team is on my
to-do list. If there's any Persian translator out there who wants to
help, pls contact me.
Kudos to sukhe and ioerror for this release :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Reviewing website/docs 
Lovely humans, dear bots,
I've started identifying and updating outdated documentations on
torproject website since last night, and the more I dig the more I
realize rewriting the whole thing is not a good late-night hobby nor a
one man job, so I decided to write this email.
I need your help to go through the torproject website, at your
convenience and see if you find any misleading, confusing or outdated
documents or information. It doesn't matter how much of an average or
advanced user you are, all inputs are valuable.
Most of the documentations are meant to be understandable by average
users, so if you're having a hard time following them, there's a good
chance that doc needs to be rewritten.
Once you found something, please either report it via trac [0] or [even
better,] fix it, if you know how to use git [1] (you still need a ticket
and put a link to your pushed branch).
Let me know if you've any questions!

@_subject: [tor-talk] TPO/TBB clone on SourceForge, use of TPO name 
Seems like the one mentioned in  is gone, either those letters
have been actually effective or the maintainer decided to remove the
project (which imo is unlikely to be the case).
I say it's worth a shot to submit another complaint for these two forks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy and Gmail (continuation) 
James Anslow:
To add to all that, if I had a Gmail account, I'd use it over Tor all
the time because Google doesn't need to know and record my IP and
precise location over time just because I'm reading email. Tor can also
protect me against many many online-behavior analysis and linking them
to my Google account.
TorBirdy also protects you against many different attacks. Sending your
traffic over Tor is only one of the things it does.
