Thoughts from the community?
Blog post author here...
As I said in the post, I did find the advice against running a hidden
service and a router at the same time. However, I didn't notice it
until after I started this project and started looking for it.  I did
notice the advice to run a router if you would like to contribute.
I thought that people who are running a hidden service are also likely
to want to contribute to the Tor network, and thus they would be
likely to run a router without understanding the security implications
of doing so.
I decided to collect and analyze the data in order to find out if it
is a real problem.  By publishing the blog post, I hope that I can
bring some attention to the problem and maybe prevent someone who is
trying to be a nice guy and contribute to the Tor network from being
punished for it.
