Hi again,
besides the routing stuff I saw that on the mentioned IP (see above)
there's a nice disclaimer-like website that impresses me. I'm still not
sure whether to pimp my node to be an exit node or not (due to the
supressing that happens here in Germany). However, this suits me well.
Is this a usual practice for TOR admins, and if yes, is there a
multilingual approach?

I came across the web page on the machine after I scanned it, to be

network configuration (except one little thing that I will tell the TS),
so it might be a routing issue (ISP) or an application problem.

I could provide a germany template soon, but I have to look up the
proper legal stuff (which is different in Germany). However, there's a
law here (Grundgesetz, Paragraph 13) which states that it *should* not
be too easy to enter your private rooms (flat, appartment, house,
whatever) without having *serious* reasons for doing so. I don't see how
running an exit node could endanger other persons lives (which is stated
as an example for being 'serious'). IANAL, though...

The problem remains: No exit nodes, no reliable/fast/stable/anonymous

every day (see geopolitical stuff, yallayalla).

IMHO it's not the problem of 'how TOR works' or the (unquestionable)
benefits it provides, it's more the problem of the 'image' of the ISP
that hosts (customer's) exit nodes and therefore might have problems
with the local law (copyright infringements, etc).
Especially the censorship^Wchild porn filtering discussion in Germany
forces this topic being discussed, as claiming an exit node having
provided access to forbidden content is the 'A-bomb of getting a host
down' -- even if it didn't something forbidden.

Hi Sebastian,
Sure. But -- from the ISP's lawyers POV -- where's the difference between providing _encrypted_ and maybe _anonymized_ access to $FORBIDDEN_CONTENT and _unencryped_, _not annonymized_ access? There just is no difference. You're _possibly_ (sic!) breaking the law, and this is sufficient to shut down your machine.
This is some kind of 'minority report' becoming reality.
That's more than true; however, I just wanted to show (and thusly, prepare for action in consequence) that (especially) German ISPs will be much more rigid from now on.

that's true, for sure. However, we create a parallel world doing this.  From a metaphysical POV (IMHO), TOR is (partly) existing to defend civil rights.

The problem is that TOR (and any other system accomplishing this target) excludes the 'masses', if one may say so.

spread it across n machines with 150Mbps/n each.
