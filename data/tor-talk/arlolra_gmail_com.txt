For what it's worth, I sent some patches to emscripten
 and was able to compile Tor. I did *not*, however,
do the hard work of actually making it useable.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Standalone flash proxy 
In January, when the alpha pluggable transport bundles were first released, a short discussion ensued about running a flash proxy from the command line.
I wrote a little wrapper to provide just that, a headless flash proxy.
It requires node.js >= v0.8.x,
    > sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
To install and run,
    > npm install -g flashproxy  # adds the flashproxy bin to your path
    > flashproxy
Or you can,
    > git clone -b nodejs     > cd flashproxy/proxy
    > npm install
    > npm start
I'm looking for testers.
Most of the time the facilitatory won't return any clients.
That's expected.
Feedback appreciated.
P.S. I posted to tor-dev yesterday but didn't get much response.
Thought I'd try here as well. Sorry if you're reading this twice.

Yes (if I understand you correctly), flash proxies invert the bridge model.
Rather than a client connecting directly to a bridge,
it registers with a facilitator through one of a few rendezvous methods.
When a flash proxy comes online,
(traditionally by visiting a website with an embedded badge,
but now also by running the above standalone code)
it contacts the facilitator to see if any clients are waiting to connect.
If the facilitator returns an IP, the flash proxy makes two WebSocket connections,
(one to the client and one to a specific Tor relay, configured with a pluggable transport)
"bridging" their connections.
Here's a better explanation of how it works:
In this model, the client is the one receiving the inbound connections.
There's a patch in  to use the tor-fw-helper to help traverse their NAT.
Unfortunately, the tor-fw-helper is not yet included in the TBB.

Hello tor-talk,
We're considering launching a new check,
It'd be appreciated if you could take a moment to look for false negatives, and let us know.
There's also the bulk exit list,
The code is here,

I suppose, though I didn't want to cause confusion with the current check until it goes live.

Thanks for the reminder. That was one of first issues that came up
but I was holding off in case other strings needed translation.
