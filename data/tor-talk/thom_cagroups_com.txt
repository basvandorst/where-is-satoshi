@_subject: [tor-talk] Gmail is blocking sending email from smtp.gmail.com 
I've seen the "intrusion detected" message and also "insecure device"
messages from gmail. It would seem that ip addresses not normally
associated with your account (because Google keeps great records of
your online activity for you) may trigger the message. I don't believe Google is intentionally blocking Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] force apt-get & yum updates through tor? 
I'm using your OPTION 3 on a Debian Wheezy system and it's working for
me. I sometimes get a bad package (didn't download properly) and I have
to remove it and re-download it.
I run hidden services in a VM with no internet access, and route apt-get
through privoxy on a separate VM. Seems to work well for me.
