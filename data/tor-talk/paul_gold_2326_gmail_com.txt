@_subject: [tor-talk] Can it be used on a android phone. 
I'm new to this and was wondering if you can use the orbot / orweb on a
android phone. I can load normal sites like Google,  facebook ect but keep
getting error messages when I try a .onion site.
Is this because in try to do this on a phone and can only be done on a
computer or I'm I doing something wrong.
Kind regards.
