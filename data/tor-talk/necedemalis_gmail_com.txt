I wanted to get tor for use on IRC, but it seems prohibitively
difficult to set up. ?And I'm a programmer!
There's this tor browser bundle that I guess is supposed to make it
super easy to use, except I already have firefox, I don't want to
download another copy of firefox and set that all up. ?Then there's a
torbutton on the firefox plugins page, but that's confusing because I
thought you had to have "vidalia" and "privoxy".
And then I really want to use opera irc. ?That's what I have
installed. ?I see no reason to use any particular browser or irc
client with something like tor.
So what I'd really like is a windows driver and control panel that
hooks into the outgoing internet, can be turned on and off, and
intercepts all traffic. ?No wondering about dns leakage or anything
else. ?I don't really want to run a proxy server and then run vidalia
to put things through the proxy server and then run a special version
of a browser, etc., etc..
Anyway, just my two cents.

You're kidding me right.  A VM?  Why not just a windows kernel driver?

Heh, well, I tell you what.  You send me a hundred thousand dollars,
and after the check clears I'll write you a great windows kernel
driver.  Otherwise, I'm broke, my life is a living hell, and I already
have several projects I work on out of the goodness of my heart, so,
I'm sorry.
Thanks and good luck.

I'm not complaining about it, I'm just saying, if you want widespread
adoption, a kernel driver is the way to go.  And moreover, a kernel
driver is easier to write and support than a VM.
