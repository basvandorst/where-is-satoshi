@_subject: [tor-talk] Speculation: Next 10 years of Tor? 
Tor speeds are interesting. I think they'll become much faster -- fast enough that using Tor won't feel slow. Users will flock to it for the privacy, and because it will be more than fast enough for general use.
How fast? There's Nielsen's Law, similar to Moore's Law, but for network bandwidth. It says that end user connection speeds increase by 50% a year:
Are there metrics on connections speeds for a typical Tor user? I'm not aware of any.
I'm going to speculate and say a typical Tor connection speed today is 100 kpbs. Assuming the 50% rule, this becomes 5.8 Mbps in 10 years (100 kbps * 1.5^10). That would be more than fast enough for even video. (Video would probably become higher bandwidth than today, but hopefully with the kind of resolution options YouTube has.)
Then for hidden services, if they follow the 50% rules as well, a 15 kbps connection today would become a 860 kbps connection in 10 years.
Improvements are needed to Tor itself, for this to happen; e.g. there's the call out
for help with hidden services:
Hidden Services need some love
But, the larger improvements, it seems, are going to be with network throughput in general. Today a Tor relay that get's 4 Mbps would get 230 Mbps in 10 years, if the 50% rule applies. (Although, Nielson's Law is for end user connections and not server connections. I would expect server connection speed to grow even faster, but am not aware of any stats on this...)

Google Public DNS is one option:

Not ideal, I agree. What would you use, if your ISP's resolvers weren't an option? Also,
let's say you don't want to run your own DNS resolver. (Running your own resolver would seem ideal, but extra overhead.)

Agreed, although the privacy policy for their Public DNS service seems decent:
TL;DR They wipe requesting IP addresses from their logs after 48 hours, although
permanently keep things such as geolocation information.

The NSA gets them even before Google. I don't think that's something you're going
to prevent based on who you pick for your DNS lookups. Although of course if they're made over Tor, at least they're anonymized (helpful but may not be enough with traffic More here:

I think these kind of devices configured for Tor make good relays, but aren't
great for anonymity. Tor anonymizes your IP address and DNS requests, but
application protocols can still reveal your identity. computer's Internet traffic when you run it.  Tor only protects your
applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic
through Tor. To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend
you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy
and anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with the Tor Browser
itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to
use with Tor."
Articles like these [2,3] should talk about being good relays versus being good
for anonymity. [1] [2] [3]

@_subject: [tor-talk] Convergence and Exit Nodes 
In light of FoxAcid and the NSA hijacking traffic coming out of exit nodes [1],
I'm wondering about the possibilities for building counter measures into exit
nodes. To start it might be something as simple as bundling some type alternate
CA system such Convergence into exit nodes [2]. Have exit nodes compare what
they're seeing, and raise a flag if they see anything suspicious. Over time this could be built out into a fuller set of tools: honey pot HTTP
requests to get more info on odd certs and DNS responses, etc. Run responses
through automated Tor Browser Bundles on VMs that do system monitoring to watch
for exploits, etc, etc. It seems this is an area with a lot of potential for increasing the safety of
Tor users.
The main goal would be to more quickly expose 0days being used to compromise
users, and get them fixed. Also, to flag suspicious IP addresses.

To take this idea a step further, it might be possible to build a distributed
observatory. Each node of the observatory would be a simple daemon that does
random HTTP requests and records any interesting responses.
The responses could be shared out to a central repository where another tool,
or tools, could be used to mine it and look for problems.
Since the responses are saved, they could be injected back into a VM running
a Tor Browser Bundle to investigate further.
Other possibilities/enhancements:
- An observatory node could be configured to work with a DNS resolver to send
  requests to servers that may have a higher likelihood of returning
  interesting results, where that's possible.
- Exit nodes could be configured to run an observatory node directly, so
  traffic wouldn't consume Tor network bandwidth.

OpenWrt. Please don't. The build environment is awful for security. It uses
Buildroot, and downloads each package separately from upstream without any real
integrity checks (except for MD5 hashsum checks, over HTTP.) For example
dnsmasq is downloaded from  and only has an
MD5 sum checked. This would be very easy to MITM [1-5].
I would love to be proven wrong, but the people that run OpenWrt don't seemed
to be too concerned about security. Maybe this is just a numbers thing, and
they don't have enough people to do things right.
Debian would be a much better alternative. At least they have active package
maintainers that curate upstream source, package it, and sign it.
And, Debian's working towards reproducible builds [6-8].
Any project targeted at anonymity and security should really be based on every
possible measure already out there to ensure what you get is from who you think
it is. [9]
