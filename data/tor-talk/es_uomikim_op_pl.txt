@_subject: tor+torbutton without privoxy doesn't work 
I had installed Tor+Privoxy on my Mac, but Privoxy started pissing me
off. I uninstalled Privoxy and Firefox with Tor didn't work - I got the
"The proxy server is refusing connections" error. I uninstalled whole
pack, restarted my computer, installed only Tor and Tor-startup package,
updated Torbutton. I changed config in Torbutton not to use Privoxy and
I still get the same error... I cannot use Tor... Can I use Tor without
Privoxy? Is it possible?
thanx in advance,

First I just uninstalled Privoxy with uninstall.command bash script, but
it didn't worked - there still was the error.
Secondly I tried uninstall.AppleScript script but I got an error "Too
many errors" that told me that uninstallation was impossible.
At the end I just used uninstall_tor_bundle.sh script, everything went
'ok'. I installed only 'Tor' and 'Tor startup'. I restarted my Mac. But
after opening Firefox there was the proxy error. I uninstalled
everything and installed it another time and still the same...
I searched with /usr/bin/find for anything with privoxy in its name but
no results - it's not because of Privoxy.
IMHO it's a problem with Tor config or Torbutton but I have no clue -
I'm not an informatitian - just a guy that knows how to use google ; )

this one helped : )
I set manual configuration from this site on Torbutton and it works
finally. Tor test page says so.
IMHO this should be on FAQ, the config suggested on the Tor site is
Thanx a lot,
