Hi all,
Is it a known bug/issue that the icons for Tor Browser and Tor messenger
have really low res icons under Linux/GNOME 3?

This should be reported as an urgent accessibility bug to the Tails team

It's super important that Tor/Tails is usable for people with extra
accessibility requirements.

Hackers is amazing fun (my fav film) but it's hardly realistic :P
Have you seen Mr Robot? They consulted with actual tech people so
there's lots of legit Linux and hacking stuff.
