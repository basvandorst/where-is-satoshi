a connection in case those files try to 'callback'. Hope this helps.

Luckily it won't be installed by default so it is easily left out. Sadly
the code to implement this DRM capability is included in Firefox. If
Mozilla ever attempts to implement this DRM code it into Firefox and not
make it optional, then Tor will have a major problem on its hands. Sad day.
