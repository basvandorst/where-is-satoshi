Hi All
This is my first post here so 'Hello'
I have recently discovered that The National Lottery in the UK is preventing me from accessing their website (despite the fact that my account has funds in it) because I run a Tor node from my IP address and that I have to not run Tor for six months before they'll allow me to access my account.  They do this because they claim I might be outside the UK and use a piece of software made by Neustar to 'geolocate' me.  It doesn't cause me a major problem because I can use my phone (probably from anywhere in the world)  to access the site but I thought people might like to know.

I'm just running a middle relay which means my IP address never changes and that no-one else ever appears to be using my IP which makes their decision even more ridiculous.  Communicating with them is like getting blood out of a stone, it took me 4 phone calls and a dozen email just to get them to tell my why I was being blocked.
