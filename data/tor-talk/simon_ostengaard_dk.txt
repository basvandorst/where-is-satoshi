This should hold true (no, you can't quote me on that) in any country that pratice justice on a "not guilty until otherwise proved" basis. This also includes the United States. However I would not operate a tor server in the United States myself due to the fact that people in the United States have a tradition of sueing each other for all kinds of strange stuff (like drying dogs in the microwave or burning youself on hot coffee). And believe it or not these people have also won the case in court.

I have discussed this issue with one of the leading IT lawyers in Denmark. He said that according to the danish law (and most European laws) the only legal issue you could face by running a tor server is if the law require you to log which traffic you pass trough the server. There is such a law in Denmark but it only affects companies, not private persons or organisations.
He also said that you might compare the situation with a situation where you lend someone you phone and they commit a crime with it. In that situation you would not (by danish or most european laws) be held responsible for the crime the third party committed with your phone.
