@_subject: Changing circuit lengths 
Is there any way to change the circuit length from the default of 3?
I've been up and down the FAQ, man page, and google and I can't seem
to figure it out.

Recompiling is fine with me.  I was just wondering if there was a way
to do it without having to go that route. Thank you.

@_subject: Length of tor circuit? 
I asked this a few months ago. The function
src/or/circuitbuild.c:new_route_len determines the route length. All
that I did was comment out the return statement and place my own under
it (e.g., return 2;). Whatever that function returns is what the
length of the circuits will be.
