(All U.S. law-based thoughts)
Blacklisting is not extortion unless the state decides that a monetary fine constitutes criminal behavior under existing statues or a new law is passed against it.  There may be some constitutional basis for criminality if the blacklist names sites run by members of a "protected class," but that's probably stretching it.
The better question is whether the blacklister has civil liability to anyone in the email chain: mail user, mail server, intermediate carrier, mail recipient, or blaclistee, such that they could successfully win a lawsuit against the blacklister and collect damages against them.  So far, that's a "no."  To date, the legal consensus is that no mail server is forced to use a blacklist.  It's a voluntary action by those who run mail hosts, and while they _may_ have a duty to their mail users to provide reliable service, they have no duty to folks listed on the blacklist.  The blacklist, by its existence alone, causes no harm.
I suppose a libel theory might be grounds for a lawsuit by someone named on a blacklist.  If the blacklister explicitly states that an IP is blocked because they are guilty of some heinous behavior, the responsible party could conceivably sue to have the IP removed if the statement is not true.  The cost, of course, is far more than the "fine," so that's not really useful in practice.
Most blacklisters are reputable and provide a useful service.  If push came to shove in the court of public opinion, folks like SPAMHAUS, whom I use to screen incoming SMTP connections, would be perceived to be on the side of the angels (hopefully as would those participating in the TOR network).  Those blacklisters who are not as conscientious as SPAMHAUS will hopefully fall by the wayside because mail hosts will not use them.

I wget your torpark page every night at midnight, so I should always automatically reflect the most current versions as of that time (as well as the older ones if you ever want them).  So easy, a caveman could do it.  And does...

@_subject: Mirroring a Hidden Service 
If you can access a service, you can mirror its static content.  Assuming you mean an HTTP-based web service, any retrieval engine that can use a proxy, such as wget, can access the hidden web server and recreate its static content on your local machine.  You can then re-serve that content either normally or hidden.
Or am I misunderstanding your question?

In Boston, computer scientist Roger Dingledine tends to Tor, a modified version of a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory project, which disguises the identities of Chinese Web surfers by sending messages through several layers of hosts to obscure their path. In addition to the Department of Defense, Mr. Dingledine had also received funding from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports free speech online.

@_subject: Clear IP in Packet Headers (was Re: Torpark writes to system temp 
If the Tor entry node does not know your real IP, it can't exchange packets with you.  The "data payload" of each packet is encrypted, but the headers of packets exchanged between you and the Tor entry node _must_ contain your real IP.  The Tor entry node server will then encrypt the entire packet for delivery to the next node in the chain, and your real IP will not be visible further down the line.
