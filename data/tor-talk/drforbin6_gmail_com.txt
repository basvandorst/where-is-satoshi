@_subject: [tor-talk] quick question 
I'm running tor as a relay and watching the connections come in using arm.
I see alot of INBOUND connects which never extend. In other words they
connect stick around alittle bit (few mins) and CLOSE but never connect
with the outside world via a OUTBOUND connection. NOTE sometimes during
these times there are no circuits or outbound connects defined.
Could you please explain this behavior?
Thank you..
