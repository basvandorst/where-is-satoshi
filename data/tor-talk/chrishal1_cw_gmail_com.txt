How can i contribute, when i can't access the"tor web net"? I don't know,
or understand, all of this tech talk. It's an excellent gauntlet of
security; but, for a computer-illiterate dumbass, (like myself), i still
don't know what I'm being asked to contribute to.

Well, if they've had the kind of luck that i've had with the tor nework:;
then they've made "quiting the tor net", their New Years " resolution". As
I have.
