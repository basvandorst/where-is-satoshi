@_subject: [tor-talk] about tor entry node 
I have some questions about tor entry node
when a Tor node is used by a Tor client as entry node, how can this node
know that it is used as an entry node?
besides, why do Tor designers want to let the entry node know that it is an
entry node?

@_subject: [tor-talk] about tor entry node 
what I meant is:
Let me say that an attacker controls some nodes. At a certain time, one of
the controlled nodes is used as entry node by a tor client,  if the
attacker doesn't know that the node is used as entry node, then the
attacker can't identify the client. Even if it examines the IP addresses of
the lists of relays, the suspicious IP may belong to a client or a bridge.
so why tor designer let the attacker know when a controlled node is used as
entry node?

On the paper: Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router
there are two paragraphs about Tor's packaging window and delivery window,

thanks, however, the description is still too simple and obscure
and in the spec, it also says: "[this stuff is badly worded; copy in the
tor-design section -RD]"
so actually, my understanding is:
in the OR, the packaging window is for limiting the cells that are sent to
the OP and it can be incremented when the OR receives a SENDME cell from OP.
then how about the delivery window? it is for limiting the cells that are
sent to a remote host(like webserver)? so how is it incremented?
and what is the function of the packaging window and delivery window on the

@_subject: [tor-talk] flash and tor 
Hi, all:
    I notice that if you watch video using Tor, since flash is a
third-party tool, that will ruin your anonymity.
    I think even if the plugin flash may use the real IP for communication,
it may not reveal what content you are accessing but it just shows that a
user on that IP is using flash. Or it just expose itself to adobe company,
other entities, like government, other companies can't know about you. Am I
wrong or not? are there any paper, articles about this?
   Thanks!

but I used tcpdump to capture packets and noticed that the video packets
are sent through tor nodes, not directly to the web site
so for the website, it should regard the connection is from an IP of exit
what you meant is the adobe flash will also use the real IP to connect to
that website by bypassing tor?
