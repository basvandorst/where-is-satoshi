Disclaimer: I have worked for a well-known AV company as virus analyst for a some time, quit due to "corporate-ish culture". (BTW they had nearly intelligence-agency-level physical security and procedures, but still achieved to use 6-char passwords on a few accounts in practice.)
True. Specifically, AV software employs various OS hooks to inspect traffic (meaning it is *very* likely it will leak identifying information). Webscanners will be limited, but proxying traffic through them will enable profiling.
While having a decent AV software on Windows is generally a good thing, it will interfere with privacy. Tails live CD or using WinUSB to create "live windows" would be most likely better option.
I can confirm that it's a real threat.
In theory, would Microsoft's code signing program help here? Cost aside, would that benefit users?
