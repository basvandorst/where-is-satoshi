@_subject: Tor bug?: AllowInvalidNodes 
Sorry, but I think that patch is not the correct way to go. With "AllowInvalidNodes middle,rendezvous" (Tor v. 0.1.1.22) in my torrc-file, I expect my Tor client not to build a circuit that uses an invalid exit node. So apparently, something concerning this option is broken and this should be fixed.

I am running Tor 0.1.1.24 on a Kurobox (power-pc processor) with Debian Sarge as distribution. Today, I found the following warning messages in the tor logfile. Is this something to worry about?

I always thought that since Tor only uses the TCP protocol and DNS uses UDP, Tor will not tunnel any DNS requests. No matter wether you exit to port 53 or not.
