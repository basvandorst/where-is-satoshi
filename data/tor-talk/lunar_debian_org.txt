I suggest that you take a look at po4a?[1] and its wml module?[2].
Another approach (which might need more changes in the current Tor
website) you could look at is ikiwiki?[3] and its "po" plugin?[4].
Hope that helps.

@_subject: [tor-talk] To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton 
As someone who participate in spreading Debian on desktop systems, I am
a little bit worried on the outcomes of such decision. I think most of
my concerns apply to other distributions as well.
First, let's clear this out: I do not really care about the toggle
model. I would be perfectly fine with having a specific application to
start in order to browse the web using Tor. What I am worried about is
how it would be distributed.
In the recent times, I have seen a lot of people who were impressed by
their phone "AppStore" and other variants of this software distribution
model. I was really amazed, as I have a hard time seeing how different
it is from what Debian have since 1998 with APT.
Since 2005, it is even better: software in Debian repositories is signed
using cryptographic signatures. So when retrieving an application
from our store, there is a really good chance that the Debian community
has verified that it does not contain spyware.
The Free Software community is huge, the Debian community is quite big
as well. But I still do prefer to put have some level of trust on 1000
people than to have no level of trust at all.
That's what I keep telling to the folks I help installing Debian.
Together with "you should not install random stuff downloaded from
a random web site". "Why?" they answer, and my reply, skipping the
details, boils down to "you don't need to, everything is already in
And I am talking about Debian stable here. Users that do not want to
spend much time dealing with how their computers work. Only about
the work they want to do with their computers. Having a major system
upgrade every two years is more often enough in their eyes.
How does that relate to Torbutton and Tor Browser Bundle?
Well, as already pointed out by intrigeri, Debian has gone a great
length to avoid embedded code copies in its source packages. Firefox
security record is far from perfect, and I see no chance that Debian
security team and ftpmasters would accept to ship another version of
Firefox in the archive.
If another version of Firefox cannot enter the Debian archive, the Tor
Browser Bundle will not be able to join this great "AppStore" Debian
(and Ubuntu, and others) already has. So it will need, at least, a
custom repository, or a custom way to be installed and a custom way to
tackle security updates.
Given the amount of work Mike Hommey put in the maintainance of
Iceweasel (Firefox in Debian is called Iceweasel), I wonder if Erinn and
weasel will have the time and energy to maintain TBB in a custom
repository. Having a dedicated application to install and update TBB
makes me really nervous as it paves the road for so many bad habits that
those users I was talking about left when they started using Debian on
their desktop.
As the maintainer of xul-ext-torbutton, I also have one question: what
upgrade path should I provide for Debian next stable release?
(Doing nothing means that 1.2.5 will stay on their system until they
remove the package.)
Here is a possible solution that quickly came to me, but I have no real
clue on how much work it would need (and if every party involved would
accept it):
 1. Apply specific Tor patches against Firefox 4 in Debian iceweasel
    package. The changes that are not compatible with the common case
    would need to be activated by a command-line switch or a specific
    configuration option.
 2. Keep xul-ext-torbutton in Debian. It would be modified in the
    way that it would not appear at all in the usual browser if
    the previous command-line switch or specific configuration
    option is not active.
 3. Create a new Debian package, something like "tor-browser" that
    would add a new menu entry labeled "Tor Browser" and that would
    start Iceweasel with a dedicated profile and the specific "Tor"
    switch.
Actually, it might be better to provide Torbutton in the "tor-browser"
package. Provided that it ships a dummy package "xul-ext-torbutton" as
an upgrade path.
Does this sound like a bad idea? Too much work?
(Input from Weasel and Erinn would probably be welcome.)
Last comment: we should all continue to stress out that Internet is
not only made of web sites. If Internet was only about web sites, Tor
would had a harder time happening: this new protocol was free to run
through the cables. IMHO, associating Tor with only web browsing is like
shooting ourselves in our feet: if everyone thinks "Internet = the web"
no one notices when providers start to filter strange protocol, make
everything travel through stupid proxies or use NAT4444.
I am saying that because having separate "tor" and "tor-browser" package
in Debian gives me an opportunity to explain that Tor can be used for
other purpose than only web browsing.

I do agree with this statement. Debian users that can get the TorBrowser
from Debian repositories should be able to do so.
Except that getting the Tor Browser in Debian requires quite some work.
Some people gathered to discuss praticalities of the Tor ecosystem in
Debian during the last DebConf. A summary of that discussion was sent on
the tor-dev@ mailing-list last july?[1].

Short summary: Tor was created by the US Navy. Then hijacked by the EFF.
And now it has been hijacked again by governments (USA, China, Russia)
to spy on Tor users.
What I read here is not really interesting: it over simplify what Tor
does, how it works and lean on conspiracy theories.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Building Petnames with DNSSEC...? 
CNAME recards are probably not the best fit. `.onion` addresses do not
resolve to IP addresses. Imagine a RR like:
    tor.petnames.tld. IN CNAME idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion.
If a resolver performs an A query for `tor.petnames.tld.`, any
unmodified resolver would try (and fail) with NXDOMAIN. Because it would
try to perform an A query against `idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion.` which is
doomed to fail.
My previous research on putting hidden service addresses in DNS records
lead me to think that using TXT records within a specific prefix would
be the easiest solution. Something like:
    _onion.tor.petnames.tld. IN TXT "idnxcnkne4qt76tg"

It will not work for the same reason. Quoting RFC 2782:
   Target
        The domain name of the target host.  There MUST be one or more
        address records for this name, the name MUST NOT be an alias (in
        the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).
.onion addresses do not map to IP addresses. So resolvers are likely to
give you a NXDOMAIN answer.

Then, you can always compile the TorBrowser Bundle manually, see the
sources at: Torbutton in itself is not able to protect fingerprinting properly for a
while now, but this has gotten really worse due to some "security"
improvements in Firefox 16 and 10.0.8esr.
So, in any cases, you will need to apply patches for Fixefox if you want
any protection at all:
Then you will be able to use Torbutton again, as it takes care of a few
high level stuff still.

There are some clear advantages of running your own email server
regarding surveillance and overall control.
If you have your own email server, you can decide of your logging
policy; and not necessarily keep a trace of all your exchanges.
You can encrypt the server hard drives. For many server seizures
this will prevent the data to be accessed right away.
You are free to decide about your backup policy. When you click
"delete", how do you know if there's not a copy that will stay
available for a year?
With Postfix and probably other mail servers, you can configure a
per server TLS policy. You can make sure that the communication with
SMTP servers used by your peers is properly encrypted (and not MITM'ed).
It makes interception a lot harder.
And you can be sure that what you receive in your mailbox will not be
harvested for data collection. Unfortunately, you are never alone: this
also depends on the server used to send the email...

Sorry but getting Torbrowser in Debian is currently not blocked by
politics but simply by lack of work.
For those interested in details: Mike Hommey and the security team
agreed to ship an iceweasel-src package built from Iceweasel source that
could be used to maintain forks of Iceweasel in Debian in compliance
with the "no code duplication" policy. What is actually missing is work
to get a properly co-installable and upgradable version of a system-wide
Torbrowser. This simply requires technical work, no politics involved.

How do you handle home directories that are mounted noexec?
If I understand correctly, old versions are not cleaned up. Not the

Also, this approach does not help users to keep their bookmarks or

upgrade will result in unexpected loss of bookmarks. Even if it's only
from sight and the data are still there, I think it would result in a
pretty bad user experience.
