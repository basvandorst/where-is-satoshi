@_subject: TOR and HADOPI 
Is anyone know where find an "how to use TOR against HADOPI" ?
(Hadopi is the new law in france about P2P: if you download some music or
movie with a P2P system, the provider will send you a mail to say stop; if
you continue, they send a real letter and after, they stop your connexion
and FINE you (and you will continue to pay provider but you will have no
right to have an internet connexion :-(( )  -
