Is Skype advertised as an anonymous communications tool?  It is foolish to
expect any chat service provides anonymity unless it is explicitly
advertised as such and there has been substantial testing and peer review of
the process.

@_subject: More control over bandwidth 
I've been following the Tor project for a few months now and am interested
in contributing some bandwidth; however; I have limited uploading bandwidth,
approximately 512kbps and sometimes it can be as much as half that during
peak usage of my provider's network.  I also run a terminal server, an
FTP/SFTP server, an SSH server, and an enterprise VNC server, all of which
compete for bandwidth with my prospective Tor node which at a minimum
consumes 20kiloBYTES (160kbps) and from what I have read, if the available
upload bandwidth drops below this minimum amount, my node won't function
properly.  (Perhaps I misunderstand, please correct me if this is the case)
Anyway, what I would LIKE to be able to do is have more control over the
bandwidth my node requires, specifically, I want to donate a smaller
quantity of bandwidth... a steady load of 32kbps with occasional bursting to
48kbps wouldn't be a problem and it seems to make sense (to me, at least)
that more users would be able to serve up some bandwidth of their own if
that 20kilobyte minimum requirement was trimmed.

@_subject: jondonym (formerly JAP) going strong. 
I have been out of the loop for a while but didn't JAP have a back door
mechanism for law enforcement?  Not that I'm interested in transmitting
criminal content, my point is that I'm not interested in the police (or
anyone else) reading my private correspondance.

If you're looking for local privacy, gmail's web interface + https works,
although I don't know if google snoops what you're sending and receiving.

Forgive my ignorance but if they are hidden, how does one use them?  Are
they for the private use of the person deploying them?
I've been a subscriber to this list for quite some time, have read a good
bit of literature about TOR, but never have really gotten a good grasp of
the hidden services.
Many thanks!

@_subject: Tor server for port 443 
Can I get some feedback regarding the deployment of an exit node restricted
to port 443?
My rationale is fairly simple, I believe in free speech and want to help
make it available to everyone, especially those whose governments
criminalize certain kinds of speech.  I am also aware of some of the
weakness' of Tor such as the lack of end to end encryption when
using nonsecure protocols.  My desire is to provide a communications
mechanism that enforces end to end encryption.
Do any interested members of this list feel that such a restrictive exit
node is worth the bother and helpful to the project?
Many thanks!

Thank you for replying, Ben.
Can (the concept of) a hidden service be simplified to that of any arbitrary
protocol?  Reconfigure an application to point to Tor instead of the
Internet and if the hidden service exists, the application will communicate

Fortunately, desire and ability are not the same thing.
While I have to respect that an entity as large, well-funded, and powerful
as the U.S. military represents a credible threat to individual users that
they may select, I don't see them as that kind of threat to ALL users using
the variety of operating systems loaded with so many unique application
installations sitting behind a diverse array of uniquely configured security
Of course, for the conspiracy minded, you have to appreciate that the recent
scandals involving chinese electronics, harddrives, etc., that such a plot
just might be in the making with the consumers footing the bill by paying
for hardware and bandwidth. I don't believe that to be the case, but it
might make a good book.

Okay, that makes sense to me.  Thank you for taking the time to explain.

@_subject: Tor server for port 443 
Port 80 is worrisome to me for abuse reasons also.  My ISP prohibits
dedicated internet servers but I would like to negotiate the privilege to
host the node I have specified above.  Don't know if they will listen, but
am willing to try.  I am hoping that they can be convinced that 1. I will
limit the bandwidth to a portion of what I purchase and 2. there will not be
a flood of abuse complaints.
The host OS will be the server edition of Ubuntu 8.04.
btw, I think the Windows equivalent is

@_subject: [Wikitech-l] Planning to tighten TorBlock settings 
I view this as an example of "a few bad apples."
FWIW I believe that it is perfectly acceptable for WP to require
contributors who wish to use TOR to contact WP first.  This may not prevent
the most determined vandals from obtaining accounts but troll/abuser
management is part of managing a site that accepts public submissions.
I also believe that there are plenty of "good actors" who simply want to
remain anonymous while contributing to WP and hope that WP would allow these
contributors to do so which would also be beneficial to TOR since it would
demonstrate to public venues that TOR has plenty of users who are good
My two cents
