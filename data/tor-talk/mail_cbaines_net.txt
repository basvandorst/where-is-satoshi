@_subject: [tor-talk] What's better than Tor for criminals? 
The assumption here is that criminals are happy breaking the law (as
they have done so already, by definition) with their methods of anonymity.
This can range from simple things like theft, the criminal steals
someone else's computer, and uses that instead of their own. Or more
complex things like botnets, which are often much larger than the Tor
network in terms of number of nodes, and therefore its better for the
anonymity of the (criminal) operators if the botnet itself is used as
the mix network instead of Tor.
Obviously, most legal systems probably frown on both of the behaviors
discussed above. This is where Tor fills the gap, providing strong
anonymity, in a manor that does not require theft, running a botnet or
other "sensibly" [1] illegal behaviors.
1: The caveat here being that using Tor is not in some way illegal
somewhere, the FAQ [2] claims this is the case, but I have no real idea
if this is true.

Yes, I designed and implemented a modification to tor to do this.
Currently nothing I implemented is particularly usable, mostly due to
the nature of the modifications that I made, but also partly due to my
knowledge (or lack thereof) of the code base and c.
My report is available [1] (I did the work as an academic project), and
so is the branch in which I did the rough implementation [2].
There are also some threads on the tor-dev list where this is discussed.
