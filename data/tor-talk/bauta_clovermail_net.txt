There are little details on this case:
Does the Tor project has a defense support fund or a list of committed  pro bono lawyers in different countries for such cases?

Apparently the operator is in need of a substantial heads up and  financial boost.
 From what has been reported the judgement seems to be based on a  misapplied article in order to justify a conviction.

So this is an official extremists database at a government organisation?
Are we now in a category close to animal rights "terrorists"?
Are there any anti defamation, anti abusive profiling, anti  discrimination laws
the EFF could use against the targeting of a large group of privacy minded
online users?
Does the NSA barter this database of suspicious extremists with  foreign services?
Certainly there are some friendly services eager to get their hands on  IP addresses
of NSA selected suspicious extremists located in their country.
In a few years after joining, splitting, mining this subprime database hardly
no one will know the insufficient origins of the shiny new AAA+  suspects database.
The new witch-hunters fabricate the witches.
