@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor friendly email providers? 
I am asking for recommendations of Tor friendly email services.
The two problems I've noticed are:
1. Demanding SMS verification e.g. ProtonMail.
2. Having impossible CAPTCHAs.
VFEmail used to work but the last time I tried it just got stuck and could
never create an account.
Any suggestions?

I see that Blutmagie no longer functions which is sad.
The great thing is that you could find exit nodes by country.
Is there another easy-to-use resource than allows you to find exit nodes
for each country?
I know you can do StrictExitNodes 1 and ExitNode {ca} but this doesn't
allow you to set a specific exit node from a specific country.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question for Roger (or someone): what is going on with 
I am using the latest version of TBB and for a while now I've noticed that
NoScript no longer appears on the TBB interface. I've got two icons for
"security level" and "new identity" but that's it. No NoScript.
When I check in Add-Ons I see NoScript (and HTTPS-Everywhere). Checking
the "Preferences" for NoScript reveals that, in "Default" mode, everything
- script, object, media, webgl, etc - is ticked under "allow" (i.e. is
on). I remember one used to have to allow these for all new sites.
Why the change? Why are the NoScript defaults allowing scripts and media
as standard?
I'm sure there's a reason - what is it?
Thank you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB and Importing Cookies. 
Just a quick question about how cookies are used in Tor.
Just for an experiment, I exported cookies from Firefox in JSPN format and
imported then into TBB (via an add-on that allows the import of JSON
However, while the cookies were imported in the add-on, only some of them
appeared in Preferences / Manage Cookies and Site Data.
.google.com and accounts.google.com were in Manage Cookies and Site Data
but mail.google.com did not appear.
Any ideas why?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are 'StrictNodes 1' actually strict? 
I don't want to come across as critical but ExitNodes with one node just
doesn't work.
Looking at the Tor Circuits, it starts with 'hands' but then moves on to
other exit nodes.
My torrc is simply:
ExitNodes hands

It was my error. I think the issue was that my 'torrc' file was taken from
an earlier version of the TBB.
Installing the latest version again (even though I was already using
9.0.4) with a new 'torrc' allows me to set ExitNodes 'whatever' and the
TBB does stick to that exitnode.
Thank you for your advice and time.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB "Security Level" Question. 
My impression is that the "Security Level" (standard, safer, safest) has
somewhat replaced NoScript.
NoScript is still an add-on but the icon does not appear as standard at
the top of the browser as used to be the case. Also, the preset
customization for "default" sites is to allow everything (except ping).
In terms of TBB's "Preferences / Privacy and Security" section, many sites
will not work unless the "standard" setting is chosen. Are there any
serious security ramifications of "standard" that can undermine the TBB
and thus acquire the user's real IP?
I assume not or what would be the point of the TBB? I imagine that browser
components that might be dangerous in a normal Firefox won't necessarily
be operational in a hardened TBB. Hence, "standard" (which includes JS,
WebGL, etc) is not a problem.
Could someone e.g. Roger please clarify this fact. It does feel a bit odd
using sites with JS, etc, freely working whereas in my non-TBB Firefox, I
have to constantly allow NoScript to "temporarily trust" most sites.
Thank you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are "StrictNodes 1" actually strict? 
I have StrictNodes 1 and ExitNodes hands in my torrc.
However, when using TBB, I discovered that I was often using other exit
nodes. Clicking "New Circuit for this site" then placed hands back as the
exit node.
Any ideas why? Just the one exit node in the torrc.
This suggests to me that StrictNodes are not 100% strict.

Thanks for the reply, Roger.
I have noticed the issue with Cloudflare before.
That said, I have used the StrictNodes / ExitNodes combination many times
recently and it has worked.
For example:
StrictNodes 1
ExitNodes {ro}
StrictNodes 1
ExitNodes example_one
ExitNodes example_two
So if I wanted to use a specific exitnode, how would my torrc look?
Thanks again.
