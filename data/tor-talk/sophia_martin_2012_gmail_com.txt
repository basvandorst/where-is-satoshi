But Google's purpose is not to protect you ? it is to protect their
customers (advertisers). Your value in this ecosystem, as a product,
depends on correctly authenticating your account. Google's claim that
out-of-band authentication is required to prevent spammers from using
the ecosystem doesn't hold water [1]
