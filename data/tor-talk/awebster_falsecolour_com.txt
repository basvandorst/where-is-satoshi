@_subject: [tor-talk] suggestion for start-tor-browser in GNU/Linux 
Hi all, I have two suggestions regarding the start-tor-browser script.
First, the tarballs should expand in to distinct directories.
Currently tor-browser-gnu-linux-i686-2.2.39-5-dev-en-US.tar.gz and
tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.2.39-5-dev-en-US.tar.gz both expand to
tor-browser_en-US.  This is confusing because it is important to
identify the different versions: the i686 bundle will start correctly
on x86_64, but the browser will subsequently not launch.
Second, the start-tor-browser should mention this incompatibility.
Something like this for the i686 script:
if uname -m | grep "x86_64"; then
