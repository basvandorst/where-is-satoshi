@_subject: Tor argument at BoingBoing 
There's a discussion of Tor over at BoingBoing, where Cory Doctorow published a good article:
Some of the comments are provocative:
"TOR is 99% Nigerian fraud and kiddie porn. Don't take my word for it. Set up an exit node and sniff the traffic for five minutes. In my opinion TOR is a virus botnet that, rather than being spread by exploiting software vulnerabilities, is spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in the ideology of naive geeks. But it facilitates crime - the actual human exploitation kind of crime, not the victimless kind of crime - just as well as any other botnet."
Perhaps some here would care to post in defence?

I agree that you can't change the minds of idiots, but I think it is important to publicly refute them - especially in a forum with an audience of thousands. Dave McK

@_subject: Best with limited bandwidth - relay or bridge? 
I've been running an exit relay for about 6 months on my  Linode VPS. The bandwidth on my hosting deal is capped at 200Gb per month, so my relay is limited to 50k, bursting to 90k - that keeps it safely around 80% of my monthly bandwidth allocation. I was wondering if switching my service to a bridge would be more useful? I have heard that bridges are in short supply, and I'd like to help out as best as I can.
Do I have sufficient bandwidth to do this? Or should I just stick to running my slow exit relay?
Any advice appreciated.
