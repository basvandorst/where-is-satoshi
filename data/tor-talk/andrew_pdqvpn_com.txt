We have to be more pragmatic tor is horrendously slow/unusable in some
of these countries, and as long as you take some steps like not using
single hop for either Proxies or VPNs, then you are addressing the
treat model that they face, not one that we are making up in our
heads. I realize that it is not perfect, and there is a trade off, but
people on the ground are looking at it and making that choice for
I've spent a lot of time working on issues with Syria lately, the
universal report is that tor is terrible slow, they can't use tails
because it takes too long to download/ is blocked, and their data
might leak if if they use Tor, so using a VPN with some precautions
taken is much more appetizing.

What do they typically ask for, and is it from any place in particular? Also
what sort of things typically generate these notices?

Recent cases of people being stopped by DHS as they enter/exit the country
due to political causes they are affiliated with. Not really anything to do
with Tor yet, but wikileaks or hacking in general.

I doubt that I will be able to get to dresden, but is there a chance of some
sort of video conference? I like the idea of putting together so sort
of official group behind the tor exit node operators. There are a ton of
things that this could encompass, and we could roll up a
few different efforts under one header. Also it allows those that want
to sponsor nodes, but not deal with the tech side of it to contribute.

That is not really how Tor works as far as I know. A more dedicated proxy like squid is what you should look for. Similar to what was done for the Iran protests.
But adding new nodes helps the entire network, and increases general capacity. If know someone that needs something more specific like a VPN tunnel then that is a whole other issue entirely. With that said I would be more then happy to get that setup for people if that is required. I am sure others on the list would do the same.

One could argue that recording traffic goes against the spirit of the tor project and anonymity in general. But even if people do monitor the traffic as long as they don't control both nodes there is little chance that the end user can really be tracked. There is also an onus on the end user to still practice safe internet habits and be careful about still using SSL, when they are entering passwords,  or doing similar sensitive things. Tor was not designed to make internet browsing safe in a general sense, rather it is meant to provide away around firewalls and censorship so that people can access the "open" internet without a fear of getting tracked as easy.

I've been lucky so far, both times police contacted me I just said it was a Tor exit node and it was ok.

Why not?
When you are running a tor node, you are in most respects making yourself an ISP, so an established ISP should have no issues with doing so. Big exception though, if your local laws require subscriber info you might be SOL. I think the biggest obstacle might be public relations, or even a decent reason for doing so outside of political stances.

So please ignore the previous message. On topic: that does not look like a tor address at first glance, but I'd have to look into it further. It looks like the address just randomly has tor in the host name.

IPsec is trivially easy to block. Most countries do it at the edge with simple port based firewalls.
SSL VPN/Tor/Stunnel/OpenSSH are all better options then IPsec to beat filtering at the moment. With that said I am not sure if Iran blocks IPsec, but I'd be surprised if they didn't.

Wow, that surprises me.
I know that Syria blocks it with firewalls, and that Syria often seems to take their cues from what Iran does.
