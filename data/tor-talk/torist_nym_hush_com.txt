@_subject: Practical advice regarding Beijing Olympics and Tor ? 
Does anyone have any practical advice for visitors to the Beijing Olympics next month, regarding the use of Tor ?
There are reports of all kinds of security clampdowns, specifically on the Chinese internet infrastructure  e.g.
China: Locking down IDC server rooms for the Olympics
1) Is Hong Kong's internet infrastructure also being subjected to the same level of extra state control during the Olympics ?
2) Is it possible to download the Tor/Vidalia bundle safely within China ? Are the usual main distribution websites blocked ? Do you have to try to smuggle it in across the border ?
3) Is it unsafe to let your Tor client connect to any Tor directory,  entry or exit nodes within China itself, once you are physically in the country ?
5) What is the best practical way, right now, to avoid making  connections to Tor directory , entry  or exit nodes physically within China ?
