I'll be short because I'm not used to mailing lists, it's 6 AM and I
haven't slept yet.
After implementing the torchat protocol and seeing how bad it is, but
how nice the idea is, I started thinking it would be cool to have a
more general protocol for P2P use through hidden services.
My question is, how would it scale and what would be the implications
of such a system (every user would be a hidden service and would be
constantly connected to other hidden services it wants to interact
Would it be a good addition to the Tor world to have a P2P base and a
set of standardized extensions (private chat, groupchat, identities,
address book, broadcasting, ...) or would it be a hindrance?

What should I do then to have anonymous and secure decentralized chat,
file sharing and the like on Tor?
I reckon it isn't what Tor was made for which is why I'm asking here
if it makes sense or would end up damaging the Tor network instead of
being something useful.

It's not pragmatist at all, it wastes time and resources doing
replaces when it could have just been really binary and prepend the
length of the packet, which is the sane way to do something like that
instead of using an end of packet separator. It would allow the
preallocation of memory or rejection of something too long.
Also protocol buffers would have been a better choice for something
like that, it would have beeen even smaller than your protocol and
easier to implement, it would have made the protocol self-documenting

That is exactly what I'm worried about and what I wanted the
discussion to be headed to.

They do, you have to go over the whole packet to find them and replace
them in another buffer or by moving data uselesslessly.
The claim that it doesn't is even more ridiculous.
The name doesn't explain anything about the arguments, the ability to
simulate it from telnet doesn't come from the simpleness of the
protocol but from the text-based nature of it.
Reduncing the amount of redundant data and having a self-documenting
and auto-generating definition of the protocol is very useful for this
kind of thing.
It's less bloated than your "text-based but binary" protocol.
