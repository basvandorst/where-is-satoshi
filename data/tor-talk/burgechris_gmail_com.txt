@_subject: Question about TOR and IIS - Also hello! 
Ok...I've been running a relay on Windows (XP, Vista and Server 2003) for
the past year.  I hope this is the right list I can post this on.  Either
way, I a m looking to become more involved with TOR
(donations/development/etc) given that none of the leading presidential
candidates (except Huckabee or Ron Paul who are both lagging in the
polls) in the US seem to be worried about privacy, Real ID and etc..
I am now ready to try and run a hidden service on my Server 2003 box
(specificly IIS) but have failed miserably.  I'm stuck with IIS for now as I
have always been a Microsoft developer (hey brings food to the table) and am
not currently confident in running Apache at this time with IIS (only one
box at this time).  Essentially, I want to run IIS with a mixture of sites
using TOR and not using TOR.  I had imagined I would use my onion routing
address in the host headers of the site I want TOR packets to hit while
other sites would naturally take regular packets.  Does anyone have a clue
as to what I'm trying to do and how I might solve it?  I'm not interested in
moving to Apache at this time until I'm more confident with it and with a
cms such as TYPO3.
Either way, looking forward to get heavily involved.

Roger!  Thanks!  I've read and re-read that document and I just finally
realized that the directory path I've been pointing it to was not correct.
LOL.  Man....no telling how much time I've spent on it being convinced that
it was the fact that I was on a Server 2003 boc\x and not a linux box.
Sigh.   Anywho....Once I had the hidden_service directory fixed in my torrc
file, it worked like a charm.
Following your suggestion, I have it pointing to port 81 rather than 80.  At
first, Vidalia ran my processes up to 50% CPU usage for a few minutes and
then went back down to the nominal 0-1% CPU usage.  Any ideas why this is
the case?
I'm currently pouring over how to leave the website and server anonymous.
Any suggestions on how to suppress information and how to poll IIS for
information?  I want to really button this thing up!
Thank you so much!

@_subject: Hidden Services 
Here's a strange question.  Let's say I have a hidden service on the onion
route.  I change machines but still want to use the same address for the
service but on the new machine.  Is that possible?  I imagine no out of the
box but that it is probably tied to some PGP machine key to be able to
process it so...it is possible but with several steps.  Anyone have a clue
and suggestions?

@_subject: Tor Desktop 
I'm trying to implement the Tor Desktop as shown at freehaven on a Xubuntu
VMWare install.  First, is this project dead?  Secondly, how can I tell if
this is working.  I'm a noob in Linux so any help is good.  I didn't want to
use the Virtual Privacy Machine on metropipe as it seems too integrated with
their service and didn't want to accidently uninstall something that I
need.  LOL.  Besides, I'd like to be able to do this on my own.

No, I mean the project at:
  It uses TOR but
allows you to have a separate machine using QEMU or something like (i.e.
VMWare, VirtualBox, etc).  So does this mean that no one knows?

Thanks!  Janus is currently down (Debian issues) and XeroBank is too tied
with their product for my tastes.  I'll try incognito!

k....Still struggling with the latest tor release.  To rehash, I am on
Windows Server 2003 with the latest release of Tor.  I'm trying to set up a
relay and am getting a control socket is not connected error but I finally
got a log message : Mar 03 12:55:59.255 [Warning] Unable to find any
platform nameservers in your Windows configuration.  Perhaps you should list
a ServerDNSResolvConfFile file in your torrc?".  Could someone give me an
idea as to what to do with this?

@_subject: ServerDNSResolvConfFile 
k...more on this.  I have now read that this needs to point to a file that
resolves nameservers.  Before I didn't have to do this but oh well.  I've
looked up resolv.conf but to be honest I don't know where it is suppose to
point (i.e. I don't want to use my personal nameservers for privacy sake).
Thanks for any wisdom,

@_subject: Quick question about TOR and use of SSL 
Cool beans.  Thanks for the clarification.  You do raise one question in my
mind.  I've been playing around with multiple OS's (i.e. Ubuntu 7.04,
Windows XP and DSL) but I'm tied to Windows XP (I'm a contract developer and
traditionally get paid for .Net work).  Obviously there are issues with IE,
FireFox isn't much better unless you know what you're doing and the others
have some javascript issues.  All of that said, what kind of setup do you
use and how does it provide you extra anonymity/security versus others?
On most sites, you just can't get by without some sort of use of cookies.
Of course, this too limits your ability towards privacy so I'm trying to
create a best practice scnario for myself on a site-by-site basis.

@_subject: Quick question about TOR and use of SSL 
This has been bouncing around my head for a few weeks but I haven't had the
time to either research or even figure out how to get my definitive answer
without asking.  My question is 2-fold in that it works on the hows of SSL
and in relation to TOR.  If this is answered on the tor-project site then my
thick head isn't processing so my apologies.  First, my understanding of SSL
is that it creates a direct tunnel from your computer to the web server (or
router if the SSL certificate is bound to somthing like a load-balancing
router).  If this is correct, wouldn't this "short circuit" the TOR purpose
of obfuscation?  On that note, isn't the 48,62,128,256 bit SSL encryption
there so that no one can do a packet sniff on the packets at the accepting
routers outside the DMZ (i.e. an example would be a load balancer that
doesn't do SSL but just passes that to a web server on the farm) but not for
regular traffic through the multiple hops on port 80?
Hopefully I'm making my question clear and I can get a definitive answer.

@_subject: Quick question about TOR and use of SSL 
ok...thanks for the clarification.  I thought that "tunnel" meant less hops
but that was a misunderstanding on my part.  So it all comes down to the bit
encryption per packet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Safeplug" 
I very rarely (if ever) comment on this list (I like to read and
learn).  That said, I've been looking into building a TOR router using
Pi.  This is because I have elements within my home that are
technically inept and thus are a danger to themselves and everyone
else (ageing parents...what can you say).  I've been planning a coup
by secretly replacing the current Tomato router with something like
the Pi (I've been unsuccessful in getting TOR to work on the Tomato
router).  The scare, to me, of buying a device is what is in there
(things that compromise TOR) but it does tempt me because I'm lazy
(probably the cause of my downfall).  Granted a router does not
guarantee safety from Grandpa downloading something bad that
compromises the router but one step at a time...right?
