@_subject: [tor-talk] What happens when an .onion site is compromised? 
Imagine that an .onion site is compromised. This could be by the owner who
wishes to expose visitors or by the police who want to target the
(I remember, in the later case, reading something on Deep Dot Web about
when the FBI took over a CP site and installed malware).
The goal is to acquire users' real IP addresses.
What would happen to a visitor if they visited a booby trapped .onion
site? The visitor would be using the current version of TBB. How would it
be possible for a visitor to be in danger?

Are there any serious disadvantages to using JS with the TBB.
As we know, disabling JS prevents some sites working at all while other
sites has reduced functionality.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I'm sure that server-side JS cannot get the
user's real (non-Tor) IP address.
If that's correct, what's the problem with using JS and the TBB?

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Tor Circuit" list in TBB displaying incorrect exit node 
I have noticed that the "Tor Circuit" list in Tor Browser sometimes shows
an incorrect IP (and location) when connected to specific web sites.
I used "StrictNodes 1" in torrc and selected the exit
"PrivacyRepublic0001" which is based in France and has an IP address of
Usually when I checked the "Tor Circuit", the correct 178.32.181.96 is
shown. However, sometimes it showed a different IP of 179.43.168.166
(Switzerland), 192.42.113.102 (Netherlands), and 109.70.100.11 (Austria).
179.43.168.166 is "mccowan", 192.42.113.102 is "Spigen", and 109.70.100.11
is "karfiol". None of these are exit nodes.
The odd behavior only happens with certain sites:
  (for example - there must be many more)
It does not happen with Google, Gmail, Amazon, Alexa, Yahoo, CNN, BBC, etc.
This is nothing to do with any specific exit node. I've tried it with
others. For some reason, on a minority of sites, the correct exit node
does not show in "Tor Circuits" and, in its place, a non-exit node is
Is this a known bug? Or something problematic with certain sites? Why are
these sites different?

@_subject: [tor-talk] 'Tor Circuit' list in TBB displaying incorrect exit 
So nothing to be concerned about. Cloudflare-protected sites display a
different non-exit node Tor IP shown in "Tor Circuit".
Slightly related question: using the same French exit node
(178.32.181.96), on  the "Tor Circuit" is
correct, but the site itself shows the IP as 37.187.129.166 (which is also
in France). Any ideas why?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Decent guide to setting up an .onion site on a VPS? 
Is there a recently-written simple guide to setting up an .onion site on a
VPS for Linux? There are many guides out there - some several years old.
Others assume you want to create the web server on your own machine.
Any suggestions? Thank you.

I had seen this before but it assumes one runs the onion on one's own
machine. My computer is not on 24/7. Isn't there an up-to-date guide for
running hidden services on a VPS?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How long does it take for websites to discover new exit 
As we know, many sites block Tor while others have awful CAPTCHAs.
However, new exit nodes are created all the time.
Does anyone know how often sites check the public exit node IP list and
add them to their databases of exit nodes?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to use Tor without a website knowing I am using Tor 
What's the best way to connect to a site via Tor if the site engages in
exit censorship?
Bridges - or is there a better option.
In short, I want to have all the benefits of Tor without the destination
site knowing I am using Tor. Is this even possible?
