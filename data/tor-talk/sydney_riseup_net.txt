@_subject: [tor-talk] How do the OBFS4 "built-in" Bridges work? 
Hi Nathaniel,
There’s no reason bridges can’t run on “non-standard ports”. I run a bridge on
port 8080 (common alternative to port 80) with obfs4 and it gets utilised quite a bit.
The server running the bridge runs a fairly innocuous website to avoid attention
being drawn to it, however, that prevents me using ports 80 and 443. The website
itself is also bandwidth heavy, to reduce the suspicions of a casual observer like a
public WiFi operator (but not a powerful adversary).

The EFF website still has the following, which you actively chose to ignore:
“...and temporarily stop sending and especially reading PGP-encrypted email.”
This could easily be interpreted — especially by someone that doesn’t natively speak English — that PGP is not safe.
This is how I initially read the article.
I agree with ProtonMail when they said: “We agree that the  warning is overblown and disproportionate... we think that stories claiming "PGP is vulnerable" are inaccurate.” (

It’s a effectively security alert; it warrants caution. I’m a native speaker and read it the same way. You need to pull your head in.
