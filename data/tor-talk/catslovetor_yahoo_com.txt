What's the current state of Pidgin? Specifically about DNS for IRC?
Can I use Polipo or Privoxy to make sure Pidgin doesn't leak DNS?
"Tor IM Browser Bundle discontinued temporarily" (from 2011, that's a serious temporary time period!)

Other privacy leaks are voice support of "libjingle".
You have to compile Pidgin by self without voice support.
for Linux/Unix:
--disable-idn --disable-meanwhile --disable-nm --disable-perl
--disable-tcl --disable-avahi
Seems, it works for me. Did not found a leak.
(sorry for two answer mails)

Hi Karsten,
Thanks. Is this an issue I would need to worry about if only using Pidgin for IRC with Tor? I'm on Windows and Ubuntu so I'll look into building on Windows, too.

Pidgin 2.10 contains a proxy type "Tor/Privacy".
It doesn't leak DNS requests.
Do not use proxy type "HTTP" with polipo or privoxy.
Best regards
Karsten N.
Thanks! I knew that was there but didn't releaze it fixed the DNS issue. Cheers :)

Good afternoon,
 "In fact, I think it is fair to speculate that running the latest and greatest pluggable transport bridges to help censored users is the best existing way to defend your own traffic from correlation, especially if your transport is under heavy use."
I'm a bit confused: To run "the latest and greatest pluggable transport bridges" would I simply turn my vanilla TBB into a bridge for other users via. Vadalia? Or, do I need to do something more? I've searched all over the Tor Project web site, as much as I'm able, and didn't find a yes/no answer, or a "here are the steps" answer.
As a corollary, I use Cupcake and Tor Flashproxy badge for non-Tor use, to help Tor users when I'm not running Tor, does this offer me any obfuscation of my non-Tor (and Tor e.g. when running TBB and e.g. Firefox concurrently) Internet usage (such as e.g. metadata)?

Hi all,
This mailing-list is a stupid fucking joke, well, at least for those of us who aren't techies. Really, this is stupid, you're not allowing a lot of people to community by using this Ivory tower mailing-list crap.
I've been using Tor near 10 years now, and this has GOT to change. It's like Tor Project is stuck in the 20th Century! I know all the arguments about why Tor Project hasn't (and seemingly won't) offer a way for everyone to communicate, and they're valid but they're also bullshit. They're bullshit because you're all (or, at least most of you are) using them as an excuse to throw up your hands and start a stupid fucking stack exchange page . . . with all it's Fackbook integration and other crap users have to wade through :(?
I will never donate another penny to Tor, and I've given quite a lot (anonymously) over the years, until a real solution is found. What the hell happened to the money that was supposedly ear-marked to write (or hack) a forum software?
"real solution" = discussion forum
I'm going to start an account at stack exchange and try my damndest to make my question in the top:?
"Why won't the Tor Project support user-friendly form of anonymous communication - i.e., a discussion forum?"
Stop with the fucking madness! Just make a real solution and be done with it! Otherwise, decrease the lag time between when a message is posted on the mailing-list and when it reaches my inbox. I mean, what the hell?! Why does it take so effing long for an e-mail to reach my inbox when it's been up on the mailing-list for quite a while?! That's why it's so hard to use mailing-lists, there not instantaneous, so it's very hard to have a on-going conversion.?
Mailing-lists suck Cartman's balls.
The Tor Project needs someone who ONLY cares about Tor's users, not about the code per se. Having the greatest Tor in the world is a great goal, but if you don't allow non-tech users a way to communicate your work's not worth a damn (as techies already now how to use these programs, the prole you're trying to help generally DO NOT - I know this because I teach many people how to use TBB).

If you only offer the TorButton's version of New Nym that will be a real shame. Please add the requested functionally.

I don't want to comment on everything you wrote, I agree with most, except about e-mail being preferred by the non-techie type.
What I did want to comment on is two things:
1. I would be more than willing to help people that ask questions on a discussion board (forum), as along as it's not some lame ass software like what the Tor people were first proposing. I.e., were and when the forum site setup the free Tor forum as a test, I can't recall the forum software, but I do recall is was very ugly and not user friendly, e.g. no "child forums" (aka sub-forums).
I've been teaching people how to use Tor for a long time. I the person who first came up with the concept and rough working of TBB, I told Steven (and others) about it on Tor's IRC channel years ago, and Steven took over from my very rough work and made TBB for Tor Project. And I'm the person who first came up with the concept for TorButton, in it's current state, ie. more than just a proxy-switcher, when I proposed including Privoxy scrubbing functions in TorBrowser, so it can also do HTTPS. Mike even asked that I write the code, I tried, but I suck, so Mike did it.
^^^ I wrote that not because I think it's anything compared to what Nick, Roger, Mike, Jacob, et al., have done, I only wrote that to show that I'm not just throwing stones. I really CARE about the Tor Project, I've given a lot of money, time, and effort to the Tor Project.?
2. This e-mail you wrote only very recently appeared in my Yahoo! inbox, and I refresh every couple of minutes. Your second e-mail that's up on Tor Talk hasn't even arrived in my inbox yet. That's why I'm so pissed that Tor deiced to give up on forums [0,1], because mailing-lists are not for average users, nor is a stack exchange page.
P.S. I'm sorry about cursing, you're right, I shouldn't' have cursed. But I'm so tired of this stupid discussion, it's been going on for a long time, and the Tor Project still is wringing its hands. UGH!!!!!!!?
Why the hell I try to help newbs when Tor Project won't help them, I have no idea . . .
P.P.S. Sorry for top-posting.

Personally.? Maybe I'm stuck in the past, but I love email because it is the
only unified messaging solution available where at least techies can limit
who can track all their communications.
Forums are 20th century! "No one" uses them; they do, but they are as much
not "it" as email is not "it" anymore.
Tor could go "Gooogle+" "Facebook" etc. HA! obviously we can't do that;
Where did the money go?? Good question.

Did you ever think that it's Yahoo that's creating the delay? I know for a fact that Yahoo's frequently defers inbound email, for minutes, if not I can tell you what sucks. Logging onto multiple disparate discussion forums, all with different credentials and unique user interfaces - especially when there's no activity on them for hours/days.
Yes, I did think that it's Yahoo! that's creating the delay, but that's even the _bigger_ problem. The way I see it is many non-tech (newb) users of Tor use web-interface e-mail services, like Yahoo!, Gmail, etc. Now, I understood the problem was due to the mailing-list software of Yahoo!, or a mix of both, so even though I was pissed I understood. Most newbs are not going to understand, not that newbs would use a mailing-list in the first place . . .
In terms of "multiple disparate discussion forums" could we, for example, use these as examples?
Tor bug tracker
Tor blog
Tor mailing-list
Tor e-mail help
Tor phone help
Tor stack exchange page
Tor IRC server
. . . my point being the problem you propose is _already_ here, and newbs get to use practically none of those, except the blog (which gives them very little help), or e-mail or phone (but I'm sure those that operate those services would love a newb pressure release valve, aka "discussion forum.")

You seem to have been pretty active in the Tor community over the last? decade. If the communications format is so horrible to you, why not do? something about it?? Instead of going on a mailing list, using? offensive language, and saying "why won't someone fix this", why don't? *you* fix it?
Take a little time and learn how to properly and securely set up the? software you think is needed and offer the project your services to? host and run it.? That way, you'd have a solution to the problem and? be officially backed by Tor.
Also, I'm surprised by your "Im done!" statement. Isn't your privacy? worth a little more than convenient group communication. People don't? stick with Tor because it's easy or has a great mailing list. The? stick with it because they feel their privacy is more important than? those things.
Just to reiterate: fix what you think is broken. Heck I'd even? volunteer time to help you out if you needed it. Leaving isn't the? answer: work is.

If 'Compatibility Mode' works, While in compatibility mode, can you try

Sorry, I forgot to write that I was able to use TBB when I added those two lines [0] to prefs.js, _without_ TBB running in XP SP3 compatibility mode.
P.S. Sorry for top-posting, but otherwise I would have to wait at least 10-15 minutes for the e-mail I sent the list (~1 minute ago) to reach my in-box, and I'm ready for bed . . .

Ok, people on liberation-tech are reporting that they can run the bundle
if they right-click on it and go to "Properties->Compatibilty->Run in
Windows XP Compatibility mode."
If 'Compatibility Mode' works, While in compatibility mode, can you try
setting one or both of these to 'true' in about:config:
? gfx.direct2d.disabled
? layers.acceleration.disabled
Then try without XP compatibility mode, and see if one or both allow you
to run without crashes?
It also looks like Mozilla hit a similar bug some years ago, and
maintains a blacklist of bad D2D drivers to disable D2D for:
I wonder if we somehow didn't pick up their D2D driver blacklist in this

Following a dozen forums is a time-consuming hassle, but keeping up with a
dozen of mailing lists in a proper client with filtering set-up is just a breeze.
The best you will get from your proposed change will be something like Ubuntu
Forums, it's too often that when I google about some problem, I get a link to
those, and it's almost always some clueless newbie asking about a vaguely
similar problem, but getting no replies on their thread, or a couple of
even more clueless, useless replies. Seems like no one competent wants to
participate in forums, so at best you will get "the blind leading the deaf"
type of "communication".

Personally, I've only recently become interested in Tor and I was *happy* to see that its community uses a mailing list rather than a forum. To each his own. No need to remember yet another log-in, and each posting s sent directly to me. What could be more convenient?
I'm not sure where you're coming from. Why can't non-techies use email?!? How is this mailing list preventing a lot of people from communicating?
You're clearly frustrated about something, I'm not sure what and, despite the length of your tirade, you failed to explain why a mailing list is (in your opinion) "ivory tower" and beyond the capabilities of non-techies. Okay, we get it, you prefer forum software of some kind, but why? Why is email so terrible? Why is a forum superior for those you deem non technical?
I don't want to re-hash _years_ old debates, please read the bug report links and other links I posted to old tor-talk threads. That will explain why I and many others feel there should be an official Tor forum.
TL;DR: Newbs won't use mailing-lists; mailing-lists are a entry barrier to newbs getting help. TBB is geared for newbs, yet we don't try to help them in an efficient and meaningful way.
And I never suggested the mailing-lists should go away, the problem is mailing-lists only help a small sub-set of TBB users, those that don't really need basic newbish help.

Thank you.? I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this allegation is unfounded.? Non-techies have been using e-mail lists for decades.? The most clueless computer users in my college who used AOL for practically everything still somehow managed to subscribe to majordomo lists through pine from a shell prompt.? Subscribing to this list is easy compared to that method.? Now, of course there is something to be said for "non-techies" choosing not to use e-mail lists due to the abundance and availability of services like Facebook or Google+.? Those services are promoted better.? But, the claim that the same people signing up to those services, which require an e-mail account in order to sign up for them, couldn't sign up to this list does not appear to be supportable in the slightest. For the reasons others have stated, I prefer e-mail as well.? Forums are a pain to navigate compared to e-mail.? They simply become too fractured.? I also got to see the implementation of one e-mail list that attempted switching over to a web forum while integrating the list into the forum.? People could make posts or reply to the list and it would also show up on the forum.? While a novel idea at the time, and I unfortunately have no recollection of what the software was named, it was an ugly mess in implementation and was abandoned in fairly short order.

So you should lobby for an research paper which objectively compares
newbies trying to use mailing lists for help comparing to newbies trying
to use forum xyz. Perhaps such as study already exists?
Unfortunately, thats nowadays the only way to make up your point for
many topics. Debating won't work here, it has been already proven that
discussion doesn't convince the other side.
At the moment most techies just don't believe or can't imagine that
anyone has more difficulties using a mailing list compared to a forum.

Bug reports? Email bug reports? Tor bug reports? That there should be a forum I am not questioning. I'm just wanting clarification on what's wrong with email. You asserted, numerous times, that email sucks for this community but never explained why. I fail to understand how reading old bug reports would clarify this for me. Newbs to what, Tor? Why won't they use mailing lists? Personal preference, lack of skill or something else?
Why? Just trying to understand the "barrier" aspect. And TBB is....?
Are you saying that newbs don't *like* email, preferring forum-type interfaces instead? Is there research on this? Or do you have only anecdotal evidence? Personally, there is enough variation in the mechanisms and functioning of the various forums to which I subscribe that I vastly prefer the consistency of email, filtered right into mailboxes I can peruse without missing a thing. No need to "subscribe" to threads. It just works. But do explain how email is a barrier to newbs.

I can only speak for myself, but I stayed away from mailing lists when I
was a 'newb' because they seemed strange and technical. This is also back
at a time when I did not use email very often.
I think that how much you use email is closely related to how much you like
mailing lists. As someone who checks email every day, I am very partial to
mailing lists, it allows me to monitor everything that comes through the
list. Forums hurt my eyes a bit more, and often I can't figure out which
threads have valuable information.
But there was a time when I used forums a lot more than email. I read
everything that would go through my favorite forums, and keeping track of
threads was much easier.
Ultimately, I think that having an email list and a stack-overflow is just
fine. If we had forums we would need knowledgeable people to read every
thread that got created (or at least every thread that got created in their
particular sub-forum). Right now I'm not sure there are enough people ready
to read the forum. I wouldn't read a forum, I'm only on this list because
it's convenient through email for me.
And I don't see why there can't be an unofficial tor forum. If you want one
so badly make it yourself, and see if people populate it. If the forum you
make gains enough traction on its own, I'm sure it would gain official

Both my parents are grandparents and would qualify as technologically inept.? These are people who have called for help connecting to the net only to discover that, in order for that to happen, they needed to have their DSL modem powered on. ;)? Both have subscribed to lists for personal interests over the years.? In the 90s, I'd be more sympathetic to the Grandma Test.? But, with today's incarnation of the net, which is entirely point and click driven for common users, it's not an issue.? If someone figured out how to sign up to Facebook, they can figure out how to sign up to an e-mail list.
I've just yet to see a very elegant way to merge them.? The closest I've seen is Sympa.? Perhaps take a look at that?? It's a mailing list service where the archives can be used and accessed like a forum.

On a side note.? Your email title quote "That evey1 can use"? ? I think thats is a great goal..but may never be achievable.? Your asking for a process which everyone can use.? Where everyone is comfortable.?  Being as some people prefer email over forums, and some forums over email.. as well as other forms of communication.? I don't think its possible to find one fit solution for "everyone"
Take for example people in countries where access to a computer is limited, but access to a smart phone is possible.? Sending and email would be easier than trying to log onto a forum on a 4in screen.
This mailing list is a good start.

I think email is a simple platform that everyone can use, even though some people (you) may not be happy about it.

Hi Warren,
It's now clear to me you're a troll, or at least very dense and obtuse. Go back under your bridge, you will never get another response from me. Why don't you go be disingenuous elsewhere?
If you're so new to Tor, why don't you build up some cred before telling me what to do? As I've done WAY more for Tor Project then you, at least according to what you've claimed.

So, basically, you want to protect newbs from ever having to learn to use email. Do you not believe that email is a valuable tool? Is it, in your opinion, an outdated mechanism? If they learned to use email, would they not likely find it a handy tool?
Yet newbs routinely figure out the intricacies of FaceBook. A proper email client takes care of threading. No one is "making it hard". It is what it is; if they want help, learn how to get it. If you want to make it easier, then do it. I'm brand new to Tor and, IMO, the developers should be working on Tor, not on ways to save newbs from having to learn anything. Seems to me that if these folks want to use this free product, the least they can do is put in the effort to learn how. Now, if you want to make it easier to find help, by all means, do. I applaud your altruistic motivations. But I do not applaud your initial rant which seemed a bit like the spokesperson for the "Occupy Tor Street" crowd demanding that the one percent work harder to give the 99% better free stuff. I'll make this offer: you do the research and choose the forum software you want (that runs on a standard LAMP server) to use and I'll put it on line and make you the admin. Create the forum of your dreams and I'll foot the bill. Fair enough?
Let the Tor developers work on Tor. tor-talk mailing list

Extracting over existing Tor Browser is strongly discouraged.
Installing plugins and changing settings is strongly discouraged.
Export your bookmarks. Wipe the existing Tor Browser directory. Extract
the new TBB. Import your bookmarks.
Or just use firefox sync with a throwaway/anonymous email account.

We do need a better search function for all of our sites. There was a
plan to use startpage,
  And there was a
yacy search engine we were testing for only *.torproject.org, but it
didn't work so well. We're open to better search suggestions for a
custom *.torproject.org search.
It's easy to complain about lack of forum, harder to do something about
it.? A forum won't solve your search problem, as most of us will still
use the mailing lists.
