@_subject: [tor-talk] Does an Exit Node will be tagged with an "Exit" flag? 
Hi there,
    I used the TorDNSEL to verify an ip address of an exit node whether
    I can sent some kind of traffic through that node and found
    something is weired. First the information of the node can be found
    in the cached consensus file on my system with running a tor client.
    The following is the information i got from the file:
r RaspberryPiNode W0bcalLslxBCGL+ZSEf+rcrB4kg
0i+Gakd+PPsGt7NB80GVzBNnfhA 2014-07-03 00:41:38 188.2.94.252 443 80
s Named Running V2Dir Valid
v Tor 0.2.3.25
w Bandwidth=5
p accept 25,110,119,143,443,465,995
The node is claiming that is accepting mail related traffic exit through
it, however, we can noticed that this node doesn't come with an "Exit"
flag. Therefore, I tried to send a dns query to TorDNSEL to see if the
node is in ExitList and the policy is as the same as I seen on my host:
The dns query is as the following:
dig 252.94.2.188.25.27.196.125.74.ip-port.exitlist.torproject.org
And I got the answer
"252.94.2.188.25.27.196.125.74.ip-port.exitlist.torproject.org. 1799 IN
A 127.0.0.2" from Google Public DNS. Moreover, the answer from TorDNSEL
told that the node with the ip address "188.2.94.252" is an ExitNode and
allow any smtp traffic to exit through it. However, at the same time,
the cached-consensus file doesn't show that the node is published with
"ExitFlag". I would like to ask if an Exit Node will comes with a "Exit"
flag or not? Thanks!

Dear All,
    I am running a Tor client on my system and deveploping a software
    with Stem library. I found that Tor didn't download a whole list of
    consensus to local, but a cached-consensus which is just part of the
    whole list instead. I would like to ask and know how Tor maintains
    the cached-consensus file on local and how can I make tor to
    download the whole list? Can anyone help to answer my quesion or
    provide me any useful links? Thanks.

I am trying to develop a program that can automatically build a
    circuit with Stem library and send my data over the circuit to the
    destination anonymously. At the beginning, I tried to make my
    program read the "cached-consensus" file to get the propriate exit
    node, however, some of the exit nodes failed to relay the traffic
    for me. It seems the node was claiming it can relay the traffic to
    somewhere at some port but not working as well as it claimed.
    Therefore, I am looking forward to the way to get the whole list
    containing all of the exit nodes for my program to have more chance
    for choosing the most suitable exit node. Thank you.

Hello Damian,
   Thanks for your kindly explanation. I have tried method c. you
   mentioned, and found that the returned exit node list with specified
   exit policy is not as the same as the result i obtained by quering
   " The
   mismatch of the results makes me confused. Can you help me to
   overcome this problem? thanks.
