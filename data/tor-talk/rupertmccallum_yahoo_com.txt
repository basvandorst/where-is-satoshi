@_subject: trouble upgrading TOR, and question regarding situation in China 
When I try to install the new version of TOR I get the error message:
C:\Program Files\Vidalia Bundle\Vidalia\vidalia.exe
I was wondering if anyone had any idea why that would be happening.
Also, I had a question regarding a query of a friend. I showed him how to use TOR in orer to get access to Facebook in China and he says that no longer works. Is it impossible to use TOR in China at the moment, or would there be some way of fixing that?
