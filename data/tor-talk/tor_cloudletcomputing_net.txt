@_subject: [tor-talk] virtual private servers for Tor? 
I have three Nodes running on VMware vSphere, they push around 120
Mbit/s together with the (hardware) CPU being the limiting factor.
But as with every virtualized environment you need to watch for CPU
latency issues, which are usually outside your control if you rent a
cheap VPS.

Hello Joerg,
Nope, you gonna have to live with the occasional complaint.
Usually its enough to write a two liner to explain what tor is and
put the IP Range in your block list.    Frank

i don't have detailed performance data available, but for my middle sized exit node this saves about 1/3 of my CPU and a lot of ram !
great work, very impressive! ;)
