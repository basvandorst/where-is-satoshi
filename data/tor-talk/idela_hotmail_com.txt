@_subject: [tor-talk] Question 
I'm an 11th grade student and I'm doing a science fair about Anonymity on the
Internet. Now, even though it is not possible, it can be partly achieved. I'll
be using different programs, add-ons. settings, etc. to figure out if I can be
tracked. I was wondering if I could get assistance from you guys since you must
know a lot about the subject.
Thanks
