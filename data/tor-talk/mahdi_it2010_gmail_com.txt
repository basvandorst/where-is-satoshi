But As i studied the Basic TOR paper, every middle onion router checks the
integrity field of relay cell. when the integrity matches it diagnose that
itself has chosen as exit node
but in recent papers they all says that only the third node checks the
integrity field (not the middle onion router) and of course if it does not
match it will be dropped!!
So i think that leaky-pipe is not supported anymore!!!!
AM I RIGHT?!
