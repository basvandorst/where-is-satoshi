Hello, does anyone know when the enhancement will be released to the
public ? Does anyone know how the progress is going on the attempt to
integrate and configure Tor with excitos software ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and VOIP ( related to excito's b3) 
To me, it looks like that the slower network rate of Tor will cause
problems for SIP and VOIP applications.
Will it be possible to specify a set of port ranges so traffic on those
ports will not be routed to the Tor network ?
A example :
Telios VOIP solution uses ports 5060 to 5061(TLS) (udp/tcp) as a trigger
port, and UDP ports 16300 to 16700 for traffic.
Does anyone have any info on this ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Excito's B3 and TOR 
I have mentioned Tor and Excito in :
Since i mailed Excito and Tor and suggested that a cooperation to create the worlds first box with a built in  Tor router, the developers of Tor got a pair of free B3 units to play around with. The Result:
Tor will be included in B3's software by default, and can be set as a client, bridge, non-exit relay, or exit relay. The only thing remaining is this bug:
Tor functions should be available when Excito releases a update of the
software, so a simple update from the web interface should suffice.
It is also mentioned on my blog:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Natty packages 
Hi, it seems that there is no packages available for Natty yet..
Why ?
I get the following error from apt:
 404  Not Found [IP: 78.46.17.118 80]
E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
So i am using packages for lucid.

@_subject: [tor-talk] vidalia and SSH/SSL support 
Hi, it seems to me that vidalia has no built in support for SSH/SSL
based logins. It should be possible to add support for that, and SSH/SSL
logins without password.
How to log in using SSH/SSL keys ( no password required )
It should be possible to administer remote computers running Tor over
SSH that way.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ticket #2791 (excitos B3) 
Will it be possible to force the traffic on a device( eth0 or
wlan0,or eth1 ) to use Tor ?
That should be possible to toggle from the GUI, i think.
