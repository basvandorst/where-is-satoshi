I would like to use tor with my iPod touch 1g OS 3. I found one project on
that: But that doesn't work on the OS 3.
Someone knows about IPhone developing or have heard about someone who did
the compiling?
It would be great to get some hints!
regards and thank you,

@_subject: Tor and system time 
I am sorry to disturb you with some newbie questions.
- How do I deal with system time when I use Tor? Is it the best way to let
the system synchronise with a time server?
- When I connect to an hidden service, how many hops are used from my system
to the hidden service?
  Is it just "my system" - "middle node of someone" - "hidden service" ?

I have a tor server running and i like to measure the traffic that goes over

I know there's a way do to that with iptables but I prefer to get this

Does TOR store this information somewhere so i could read it with a script?

@_subject: Tor process dies sometimes (debian relay) 
Hi all!
I hope somebody can give me some hints about that.
I'm running Tor (0.2.1.22-1~~~etch+1) as an relay on my debian server.
I have bandwidth limits enabled and normally it works well. But now I
realized that the Tor process dies sometimes. (so far 2 times)
The last log entries before the process died:
Mar 08 17:38:32.889 [notice] Bandwidth soft limit reached; commencing
Mar 08 21:11:22.294 [notice] Going dormant. Blowing away remaining
Mar 09 00:00:00.980 [notice] Configured hibernation.  This interval began at
2010-03-09 00:00:00; the scheduled wake-up time is 2010-03-09 00:00:54; we
expect to exhaust our quota for this interval around 2010-03-09 23:59:54;
the next interval begins at 2010-03-10 00:00:00 (all times local)
Mar 09 00:00:00.980 [notice] Accounting period ended. This period, we will
hibernate until 2010-03-08 23:00:54 GMT

Mar 09 00:00:54.024 [notice] Opening OR listener on 0.0.0.0:9001
Now I let cron check the Tor process to inform me when Tor has died. But I'm
not sure what happened to the process.
Did anybody see that before?

@_subject: Onion url's 
HHHow do I access Tor hidden services? ? <
Tor hidden services are named with a special top-level domain (TLD) name in
DNS: .onion. Since the .onion TLD is not recognized by the official root DNS
servers on the Internet, your application will not get the response it needs
to locate the service. *Currently, the Tor directory server provides this
look-up service; and thus the look-up request must get to the Tor network.*
Therefore, your application *needs* to pass the .onion hostname to Tor
You can't try to resolve it to an IP address, since there *is* no
corresponding IP address: the server is hidden, after all!
So, how do you make your application pass the hostname directly to Tor? You
can't use SOCKS 4, since SOCKS 4 proxies require an IP from the client (a
web browser is an example of a SOCKS client). Even though SOCKS 5 can accept
either an IP or a hostname, most applications supporting SOCKS 5 try to
resolve the name before passing it to the SOCKS proxy. SOCKS 4a, however,
always accepts a hostname: You'll need to use SOCKS 4a.
Some applications, such as the browsers Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari,
support sending DNS queries to Tor's SOCKS 5 proxy. Most web browsers don't
support SOCKS 4a very well, though. The workaround is to point your web
browser at an HTTP proxy, and tell the HTTP proxy to speak to Tor with SOCKS
4a. We recommend Polipo as your HTTP proxy.
For applications that do not support HTTP proxy, and so cannot use Polipo,
FreeCap  is an alternative. When using FreeCap? set
proxy protocol to SOCKS 5 and under settings set DNS name resolving to
remote. This will allow you to use almost any program with Tor without
leaking DNS lookups and allow those same programs to access hidden services.

*Use the macchanger utility.  Make sure you write down your original MAC
first, in case you need to switch back to it later.*
There is need to remember the mac address because it will be resetted on
start up!
So if you don't put that in a start up script, after the next boot you will
have again the real mac address.

OK, I guess I know too less about PGP. So, if someone does not have the

download the signature and the file from a fake page, you would notice by
