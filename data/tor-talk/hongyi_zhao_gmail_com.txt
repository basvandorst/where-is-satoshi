Hi all,
In the torrc file, we can use the following the line something like
the following to set the socks5 proxy used by tor to connet with other
Socks5Proxy 98.213.27.45:54225
My issue is as follows:
With the above method, I can only set one socks5 proxy used by tor to
initiate its connetion.  If I have more than one socks5 proxies and I
want to let use them for the purpose of load-balance  in the torrc or
by othere methods.  Is this possible or not?
Any hints will be highley appriate.

How to use the Tor API to periodically reset the value of the socks proxy?
I don't hear of this.

Hi all,
I'm very glad to know that the tor-browser-bundle issue the latest beta
release as follows:
In this release, it support threes types of build-in bridges:
1- obfs3 (recommented)
2- fte
3- flashproxy
In my case, considering that I use router for surfing and don't set the
port fordwarding on the router,  I don't test the  flashproxy bridges
shipped with the above tor-browser-bundle.
As for the other two types tranport bridges, i.e., the fte, and obfs3
bridgers, I find that I can use the fte method while the obfs3 doesn't work.
See the following for detail:
When use the obfs3 as the transport type within  the options of "connect
with provided bridges":
When use the fte as the transport type within  the options of "connect with
provided bridges":
 Considering that the obfs3 is the recommented type of tranport bridge, why
I meet this issue?  Any hints on this issue will be highly appreciated.

Hi all,
I use Debian Wheezy, and reside in a native-ipv4 network environment.  But
I installed the miredo tool, which can let me  tunneling to ipv6 netwoks
through NAT.  See the following for information:
Now, I try to use tor-vidalia bundle to access the ipv6-enabled website,
say,   And do the corresponding settings just as
things descriped here:
For detail:
1- In my torrc, I inserted the following line:
 SocksPort [::1]:9050
    In my /etc/privoxy/config, I inserted the following two lines:
listen-address  [::1]:8118
forward-socks5   /               [::1]:9050 .
2- Then I stared the vidalia bundle, and ensure that the tor and privoxy
are listening on correct ports:
werner at debian:~$ sudo netstat -lntup|grep 9050
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9050          0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN      6445/tor
tcp6       0      0 ::1:9050                :::*
LISTEN      6445/tor
werner at debian:~$ sudo netstat -lntup|grep 8118
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8118          0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN      4393/privoxy
tcp6       0      0 ::1:8118                :::*
LISTEN      4393/privoxy
3- Thirdly, I use tor or privoxy as the proxy to access the
 but finally failed.  Can someone please give me
some hints?

I noticed when I launch tor as the proxy, tor will use the dns informations

Hi all,
I use vidalia 0.2.20 and tor 0.2.4.24.  I found a strange issue, I describe

In my torrc file, there is a line added by me as follows:

say, changing the proxy setting used by tor to connect to network.

At this stage, basically it should means that the quality of Tor's
circuit is low or unusable.  In order to obtain a high quality of
Tor's circuit, I usually restarting Tor again and again.
So, my issue is as follows:
Is it possible to re-establish a Tor circuit without restarting Tor?

Hi all,
I try to test the ExcludeExitNodes parameter of tor, so I use the
latest exit-lists from here to construct the list for using in
The command for obtaining the ExcludeExitNodes list is as follows:
$ curl -s  | grep
-E -m1 'href=\"[0-9-]+\"' | tr '"' '\n' | grep -E '^[0-9-]+' | xargs
-r -I{} curl -s Then I use the above result as the node-list of ExcludeExitNodes, at
the same time, I set the following parameter in my torrc:
StrictNodes 1
Finally, I start the tor client for surfing the internet, and find
that it still can use the IPs listed in the  ExcludeExitNodes as the
exit node.
Any hints for this issue?

But, from the in-place manual page of tor, I can find the following description:
As you can see, all of the fingerprints, country codes, and address
patterns can be acceptable for using as ExcludeExitNodes.  Why you say
that: "It should be the fingerprints."?
As a result, I still cann't figure out what's the reason for my

Hi all,
When I write the nodes listed in ExcludeExitNodes, what's the longest
size for the list used in ExcludeExitNodes?
I mean, if I write too many entries in the ExcludeExitNodes' list,
does it will exceeds the upper limit for this list and trigger an
overflow error?
I ask this issue based on previous question "ExcludeExitNodes doesn't
take effect at all." posted on this list.  I suspect that it's the too
long list for the ExcludeExitNodes used by me that cause the issue.
Any hints will be highly appreciated.
