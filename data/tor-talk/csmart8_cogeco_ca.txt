Hi folks.
Disclaimer: The following question refers to website testing, vulnerability identification etc.
Please bare in mind that I am an end user and not very knowledgeable about internet security or so-called "white hat" While researching DoS activities, many people recommend LOIC.  I'm using Windows 7 and the latest Tor Browser.  How do I integrate LOIC and Tor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Windows Screenreader Users? 
Hi folks.
Are there any other blind or visually-impaired folks here, running Tor on Windows with a screen reader such as Jaws?
I'm new to all of this, but would like to know in advance if any other folks have run into accessibility issues with Tor, Vidalia, etc.

Please forgive a basic question from a new user.
Several browser and Windows tweaks are listed in the Tor Wiki under
Hacking Firefox for Maximum Performance with Tor:
Since this article still mentions separate components, Torbutton and Windows XP, how much of the advice still applies if one is using TorBrowser and Win7 64-bit?
thanks for any clarification,

Hugh, Find the file on your system named "Start Tor Browser.exe". Right-click it and pick "Send To". From that sub-menu pick "Desktop (Create Shortcut).
that will, not surprisingly, add a shortcut to your desktop.
Chris, assuming you're using Windows

not for blind users using screen reader software, who don't want to hear tons of quoted material first. :)
Not trying to argue, just giving a different perspective.
