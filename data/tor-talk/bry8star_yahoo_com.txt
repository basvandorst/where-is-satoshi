@_subject: [tor-talk] Towards a Torbutton for Thunderbird (torbutton-birdy) 
If below info are irrelevant or already discussed or old, then sorry to
post it here.
Are these being already done/added for "Torbutton-birdy" ?
"pref.js" file is inside below folder/directory :
Before starting Thunderbird-Portable for first time,
these lines need to be added in "pref.js".
"mailproxy" in helo/ehlo field */
user_pref("mail.smtpserver.default.hello_argument", "mailproxy");
to go via Tor-proxy. The "Polipo" will be needed when using lines which
has port 8118, http or ssl. */
user_pref("dns.nameserver", "");
user_pref("network.proxy.http", "127.0.0.1");
user_pref("network.proxy.http_port", 8118);
user_pref("network.proxy.no_proxies_on", "localhost, 127.0.0.1");
user_pref("network.proxy.socks", "127.0.0.1");
user_pref("network.proxy.socks_port", 9050);
user_pref("network.proxy.socks_remote_dns", true);
user_pref("network.proxy.ssl", "127.0.0.1");
user_pref("network.proxy.ssl_port", 8118);
user_pref("network.proxy.type", 1);
user_pref("app.update.auto", false);
user_pref("mail.shell.checkDefaultClient", false);
first-time */
user_pref("mail.startup.enabledMailCheckOnce", false);
Noticed, pressing "re-test" during adding new email account causes
Thunderbird to bypass Tor-proxy and use local network, thus leaking
ip-address & location of that email, even though Tor-proxy was
pre-specified or pre-configured.
But using the "Create Account" button located inside new email adding
window, did use Tor-proxy.
To avoid such local-net leak/use during email creation, few generic user
name based email accounts with major email service providers can be
pre-added into "pref.js". And then Tor-fied Thunderbird users themselves
can change "User1" in such "User1 at gmail.com" pre-existing emails into
their actual email/user-name.
Pre-existing email accounts with tor-proxy pre-configured in TB, does
not leak dns or tcp.
I Noticed, in older Thunderbirds, the imap, smtp server is
"imap.gmail.com". In my test, that allows to receive emails, but not
sending. And when changed into "imap.googlemail.com", then succeeds in
both sending & receiving gmail emails.
receive: imaps, 993, SSL/TLS.
send : smtps, 587, STARTTLS.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy gpg.conf 
Torbirdy, uses its own command-line & and when gpg binary is called with
all anonymization related gnupg options then it overrides those specific
options, if something else was specified for same options in gpg.conf.
so for Torbirdy, no special config is necessary in gpg.conf.
but, in windows, for Microsoft Outlook, or other email-clients, which
cannot specify their own torified gpg calls like torbirdy,
for those,
gpg.conf is needed to be configured+torified,
plus for other apps, if you want to use short commands, and
pre-specified longer options inside the gpg.conf.
any app, which cannot specify or do not specify their own gnupg options,
those will by default use whatever settings exist inside gpg.conf.

i'm not 100% sure, if Portable Thunderbird would work under Wine or not,
but worth a shot.
Many windows Portable apps, does run using Wine.
And what about loading a small custom Windows XP inside a VirtualBox

I don't like that some entity like a ISP is making list of stuff or
keeping track of stuff, for any hacker or anyone to see. It is not their
job. if a government operated entity does that (where tracking info is
highly guarded), then that is different. and, if such a government
tracking dpi center/entity is not using judicial system to
track/surveillance with/for a specific justified reason, then even that
is questionable.

probably safer will be if you install a VM software (may be, VirtualBox,
there are many others), and from beginning if you install guest/VM OS
and used such configurations (including software & hardware ids), which
will keep "Anonymity" intact for it's user and it's host computer, then
use firefox and your (any) addons on that to get file.
(pay attention to alter hardware ids as well).
install a trial windows inside a VM, configure it with your needs (lets
say you have taken 5 days for it), after full configuration, backup the
VM's image, so that every 30 or 60 days later you can overwrite the
older image with the 5 days old vm image, and go back to the
pre-configured fresh state.
except for playing special graphics intensive games, for other purpose
vm is suffice a better "Anonymity" tool.

Sorry for mentioning about using Trial Windows.
I realized, Trial will expire even if not used or used, after 30 days,
or within 90 days with grace period(s).
But, i think (not 100% sure though), there is code given on Microsoft
site which can be used only for inside VM based Windows OS installation,
or on demo software on real computer, for the OS to work for longer time
(1 yr).
And also, some of the free end-user level/based Linux OS has reached to
a very appealing level/point/stage & much much friendlier than before
GUI desktop & apps level/stage, consider try-out & using them. If you
find one is suitable & useful for your purpose/need, then simply
contribute something to that developer(s) (group). For example: Ubuntu,
Fedora, Fuduntu, PC-BSD, etc. these sites usually has a set of further
customized version of their OS, which are even smaller or more GUI
friendly or more suitable for your purpose.
if you are a student, then ask your college to give you windows disc, it
will be free or very cheap, probably. ebay has very very cheap windows
xp home discs. sometime many other vendor has deals where they can sell
you very cheap discs if you also get some hardware from them. and as far
as i understand, any windows user is eligible to use their own existing
OS also inside a VM software on the same computer, (if you use Restore
If you like and used-to with Linux, then just install another Linux
inside VirtualBox, assign a folder on host as Shared in between host and
guest, and download your files on VM on-to the shared drive on guest,
which is the shared folder on host.
Few firefox addons which i used inside VM and TBB (related to video) are:
Ant Video Downloader, DownThemAll, Sothink Web Video Downloder,
NetVideoHunter, FVD, etc
Plugins/extensions: DivX Web Player, DivX Player Netscape plugin, VLC
web plugin, Shockwave Flash, RealPlayer G2 LiveConnect, QuickTime
plug-in, etc.
i use 'Unbound' and MaraDNS/Deadwood DNS resolver/server. created total
of four windows service, two for each of those dns-server software.
one windows service uses deadwood dns server from a folder which is
pre-configured to resolve dns thru Tor-network (using TCP DNS), and
other service starts deadwood (from another folder) and uses
direct-internet for all sites except for .onion, .i2p etc TLD/sites from
going/leaking out thru direct-internet. Same is for 'unbound' dns
server. Using "services.msc" these can be started/stopped when what i
want to.
also loaded transparent socks proxy (proxifier) software to transfer all
(TCP based) traffics inside Tor-network.
on host/main-computer's OS, i dont view/use flash video based sites via
any browser which goes thru Tor-network, when i need to see something
i have "NoScript" and "AdBlock Plus" etc addons configured on firefox to
block those automatically. Plus my firewall/security-suit app allows me
to set which software components i dont want to be used by the TBB. and
also component level filtering and rules. also create rules in firewall
on host OS, to block any outbound traffic to .onion based sites by using
direct internet or your network adapters. they must go thru tor-proxy
server/gateway/router only.
i see/get Flash videos inside the VM. i also run java stuff inside VM.
if videos not playing/appearing properly, try assigning more
computing/processing power/resources for your VM/virtualbox, so it works
better, because you need to see it Anonymously, and smoothly.
do not load junk/bloated stuff inside VM, if u need only Java, then dont
install the extra things  like toolbar/anti-virus whatever they offer.
always select 'custom' option during install, watch/read every stage,
choose carefully. disable unnecessary services inside vm.
if you have backed up the VM image, the no need to install anti-virus or
firewall inside VM, as you have backup copy of fresh source where you
can fall back to after every few weeks.
tweak & tune further both vm OS & native/host OS.
sorry for the long posting, if appears to be unrelated matters.
but these what i had to do see/get videos, Anonymously.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Apps which uses outgoing fixed IP-Adrs:AnyPort, 
Hi, please help me to solve this:
On Windows (XP) i have a ("Unbound") DNS Resolver Server software
(running on 127.0.0.1:53), which is configured to send its TCP DNS
queries via an "outgoing" ip address (lets say, 192.168.0.10, which is
my (NetIntrfAdptr) Network Interface Adapter's IP address, connected to
router/gateway then to Internet), DNS resolver is using different/random
TCP local ports for that NetIntrfAdptr's IP address to send queries
toward multiple different Internet DNS/nameserver(s) IP address(es) on
their TCP port 53. This DNS resolver is configured to use(/forward
queries to) around 40 internet DNS/nameservers for few specific and
custom domain-names, TLDs, etc (stub/forward zone) related dns queries.
Root zone, the ".", is configured to send/forward query on 5 different
censorship free public DNS server(s) on internet, and those dns servers
does not keep logs for query, usage, user-info, etc either.
I would like to re-configure DNS resolver to perform it's all DNS
queries via Tor socks5 proxy server. (once query answers are inside its
cache memory then it should work very fast for other apps on this computer).
how can i achieve this ?
let me put it this way ... when an app is sending its outbound network
traffics toward a fix IP address's non-fixed different random ports,
then how can i forward such traffic inside the tor-network so that
traffic can connect to Internet servers from tor exit-node ?
can *Tor* be re-configured to present an IP address (for example,
10.192.0.10, for inbound connections) on the local network ? so that i
can specify that tor ip address (10.192.0.10) inside the DNS resolver
configuration as its outgoing IP address ?
how to achieve this without using any other apps, other than the
('unbound') dns server app and the tor app ? (or by using very very less

@_subject: [tor-talk] Apps which uses outgoing fixed IP-Adrs:AnyPort, 
Hi adrelanos,
thanks for responding & suggestions.
sorry, NONE are applicable for this case.
anyway, let me repeat & explain with another set of words for others,
again (if some confusion exist in my explanations):
my local dns-server (127.0.0.1:53) (in windows xp), is already
configured to use TCP DNS with Internet DNS Servers, it is sending DNS
queries/questions (domain-name-to-ip-adrs-conversion) to Internet DNS
servers via using an "outgoing" network interface ip address. my local
DNS-Server is using multiple different port(s) to send those queries,
for that "outgoing" interface (192.168.0.10) to various destinations
where port is same( TCP DNS port 53), but ip changes to different
Internet DNS Server's ip address).
now, how to capture all (TCP) traffic coming from my local dns-server's
"outgoing" ip-adrs, and send/forward/transport them though/via TOR ?
i want to send traffic ONLY from that "OUTGOING" ip address (specified
on local-dns-server), not any other app's, not any other traffic, ALL
OTHER traffic must go thru DIRECT Internet via using the default
net-interface adapter's ip address.
(by the way, i do already have few solutions that involves using other
extra tools. that is why i mentioned (twice i think), how to use less
amount of other tools, other than tor & dns-server software itselves).
what i'm asking is, how to configure *"TOR"*, using the "torrc"
configuration command-lines to achieve this function. And if there is
absolutely no other choice, only then use/have a solution that involves
using a 3rd party tool stuff.
looking for a solution that will use only tor, local dns-server software
("unbound"), nothing else, or use something that by default exist on
Windows computers.
my local dns-server is configured to use both tcp & udp dns locally, but
all upstream is tcp dns, it is also configured to block .onion, .exit,
.i2p, etc any even accidental or mistakenly done, or mis-configured
app's any dns leakages. and local dns-server also (need to) using, many
forward-zones, which are forwarding toward very specific DNS servers on
it is suppose to be simple ! i dont know why such option already does
not exist in tor !?! TOR has feature of creating listening dns port and
act as dns-server, i dont want it, as that cant be configured to suit my
purpose. Tor has feature/option to create transparent ip address
listening on ONE fixed port, i dont want that i guess, unless it can be
configured to capture that "outgoing" ip address specified local
dns-server's ALL/any ports.
why tor cannot listen to a SINGLE fixed ip address's entire port (1 ~
65535) range's all traffic ?
If "tor" can create such an listening ip-address let's say 10.192.0.10,
then i want to specify that as the "outgoing" interface ip address in
local dns-server's configuration.

@_subject: [tor-talk] problems with TorBirdy 
I am posting few issues :
(i know it would have been better to post in bug-report websites,
but i would prolly need to submit multiple bug/reports, anyway,
anyone is welcome to post on bug-reports in whichever way they may
find it fit or not).
My CONFIG INFO 01:
After installing TorBirdy in Thunderbird Portable (windows) edition,
i installed GPG Portable edition for Thunderbird Portable, i then
install Engmail addon in Thunderbird Portable.
ISSUE set 01:
I manually change "mailnews.wraplength" inside "about:config" of TB
(Thunderbird), from 72 to 68, but when TB is restarted it goes back
to 72 again ! why it is not honoring my custom settings ! ?
I manually change "mailnews.reply_header_authorwrote" inside
"about:config" of TB (Thunderbird), from "%s" into "Received from
%s", but when TB is restarted it goes back to "%s" again ! why it is
not honoring my custom settings ! ?
I manually change "mailnews.reply_header_authorwrote" inside
"about:config" of TB (Thunderbird), from "%s" into "Received from
%s", but when TB is restarted it goes back to "%s" again ! why it is
not honoring my custom settings ! ?
i manually change the "mailnews.reply_header_type", from value "1"
into "3", but it goes back to "1" when TB restarts !
ISSUE set 02:
In "OpenPGP" menu bar option in TB > Preferences > Advanced >
Additional parameters for GnuPG :
i change this value from :
"--no-emit-version --no-comments --throw-keyids --display-charset
utf-8 --keyserver-options
--keyserver hkp://2eghzlv2wwcq7u7y.onion"
i change above into:
"--no-emit-version --no-comments --throw-keyids --display-charset
utf-8 --keyserver-options
no-auto-key-retrieve,no-try-dns-srv,http-proxy= --keyserver
(i do not use those double-quotes symbols, just for showing here as
a string)
And when Thunderbird is restarted, its gone back to http-proxy port
8118 ! why ?
why it does not allow me to use my own custom settings ! ?
My CONFIG INFO 02:
Polipo's config file that is in wiki site of TorProject.org, using
that. Those enables polipo HTTP-Proxy (kept polipo.exe inside
E:\Bry8Star\TBB-01\Tor Browser\App\Polipo\ folder) to use DNS on Tor
exit-node via going through Tor-tunnel and avoid using local DNS. I
have configured Polipo to use for example the port 18050. And my
local Firewall is also configured for the "GPGKEYS_HKP.exe" or the
"GPGKEYS_CURL.exe" binary (which are inside
E:\Bry8Star\ThunderbirdPortable\App\GPG\ folder) to dis-allow/block
using all/any type of DNS connections.
(because, my last test few months back, showed GPGKEYS_HKP/CURL.exe
leaks DNS; that is; those two binary software/file tries to use
local DNS resolver, which they should not; they should only connect
to the HTTP-Proxy (in my case its, polipo) via TCP on port 18050,
and that is more than suffice for those to function properly. And,
not sure about most recent version though if that leaks as well or not).
I'm using TBB based Tor (on Windows XP/7). I've configured "torrc"
config file to use a different fixed port, for the sake of this
email post, lets say i use port 19050 as an example, (other than the
default TBB Tor Socks5 proxy port 9050). And then i also configure
Vidalia to use a fix/custom Control port, for example, i use 19051.
I have also configured Vidalia to start polipo like this:
Under the "Start a proxy app..." option i've specified
".\App\Polipo\polipo.exe" (without the double-quote symbols), and
under the "Proxy App Arguments" option i've specified
" -c .\Data\Polipo\18050-to-19050.conf" (without the double-quote
(i have also done (or i usually do) few more changes so that TBB
only starts vidalia+tor+polipo (without tbb-firefox.exe). Then i
start FirefoxPortable (tbb-firefox) inside the "TBB-01\Tor browser"
folder, and ThunderbirdPortable ... separately, using simple
script-file. No need to post configs related to those here now).
TorBirdy need to have a BUTTON, may be something close to "RESET",
that will reset back all custom settings to default (Anonymity
friendly settings).
But, TorBirdy should not automatically override a user's custom
And TorBirdy need to create a log file, showing what config-options
it has set/changed and time, of change so that TB user can find/use
his/her previous important changes/settings if need arises.

@_subject: [tor-talk] problems with TorBirdy 
Hi Sukhbir ... THANKS, again.
GnuPG/OpenPGP signed & encrypted email message allows for minimum 62
or 68 wraplength, i can't recall the exact value at this moment, but
that min length would be nice to set. (That is my own choice,
obviously that will not be same as others/all).
I see that now  is closed/solved, that is, Torbirdy will allow
to set user's own settings:
... Thanks.
Hope to see better Torbirdy soon.
Finally with help of another user, was able to force few settings on
TB (Thunderbird), of my own choice(s).
(I do not feel comfortable on doing those configurations manually
over & over again & again).
Warning: Do not follow below instruction, unless you are expert
enough and understand what you're doing, (Do not blame me later for
any reason .. I warned).
Had to create "local-settings.js" inside the defaults/pref folder in
TB, added one line:
"pref("general.config.filename", "mozilla.cfg");"
(without the beginning and ending double-quote symbols).
Then created "mozilla.cfg" file next to TB binary/exe file, added
previously mentioned config-settings ( i copied my choice of
config-setting lines from "prefs.js" file and set them with my own
choice of values and changed command word from "user_pref" into
"lockPref" in mozilla.cfg, it needed one top/1st line with only two
Restarted TB (thunderbird)
... my choice of custom settings remained intact.
If there was an option in Torbirdy or on another Thunderbird addon,
to allow TB users to override few config settings after TB restarts,
(with a press of a button or status bar icon), that would have been
better, then one would not need to lock those settings, to save
oneself from doing too much repeated manual configurations.
There are some settings that a user wants or must use constantly
under one Thunderbird profile, and may be another settings under
another Thunderbird profile.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Disabled Torbirdy itself Leaks DNS 
when i setup socks5 proxy (without torbirdy plugin) in Thunderbird,
then these config options are set:
and i also manually set few other config params/options, that are
related to make this specific thunderbird anonymous friendly.
with those thunderbird works fine.
And, after installing Torbirdy plugin, those options remains same.
But when i disabled Torbirdy, then:
except for below config option, all remain same:
And because of this, Thunderbird starts to use local DNS resolver on
user's local computer, instead of using remote dns via Socks5 proxy !
Thus, a disabled Torbirdy itself is cause of DNS leaks.
Luckily i have firewall in place, which previously pre-set to
not-allow any traffic from Thunderbird toward any where else, only
connection allowed for Thunderbird, is toward the ip address
127.0.0.1 on port 9050. (And on windows boxes, i needed to allow
local(127.0.0.1) loop connection for Thunderbird itself).
And firewall is also configured to WARN me if Thunderbird (or any
Torified app) tries to use anything other than what was mentioned in
above paragraph. So i was able to view these DNS leak attempts.
So when Torbirdy plugin is disabled, then it should not change that
config option to "false", it should keep it to "true" if user
previously was using socks5 proxy by specifying it manually.
Torbirdy should be able to use a file or technique, which will allow
it to remember what params/options & values were used before, so
when disabled it should revert back only those specific settings
which it changed, not to what it thinks it should be.
So pls create bug-report or please take steps to solve such problem(s).
Thank you,
