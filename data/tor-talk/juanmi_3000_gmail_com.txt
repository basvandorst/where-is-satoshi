In my case, not sure about the one who replied.
- - 2FA activated
- - Using application password for Thunderbird
Haven't had any Gmail problem with Tor
I would recommend trying to log in Gmail using TorBrowser.

As for OFTC, it's just exit node luck. Maybe if you know what node is
it, just exclude it on your torrc.

If using Linux, you can install CLI tool Arm and there is a tab where it
says which gives you the country of the node. Not sure if the city as
well. For Tails it should be the same but you'll have to do it everytime
you start Tails. But maybe that already comes with Tails, and I think it
If using Windows, you will need to install cygwin and I think it's in
the packages you can install with it.
For GUI tools I know none.

Asunto: Re: [tor-talk] The "StrictNodes 0" will disappeared from my
torrc when I do some change on the setting using vidalia.
Every time you make some settings on Vidalia, torrc file before
the changes gets renamed into torrc.# and a new torrc file is created.
So if you want to have "StrictNode 0" you better changes setting in
Vidalia, then add your changes in torrc afterwards.

Long time clearnet Gmail user here and 4-5 months using Tb+TB. The
only thing I did besides of being more than 4 years using Gmail
without Tor is using Two-Factor Authentication (mobile phone) and
assigning an Application password to Thunderbird. As of now, I haven't
got any connection refused.

????? ???????:
Because you may have two Email Service Provider groups:
Used-in-clearnet ESP accounts: Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, etc...
Tor-only ESP accounts: Riseup, Lavaboom, Openmailbox, Austiciti,
Cock.li, etc...
The problem is Thunderbird+TorMail doesn't have a specific proxy
configuration for each account. So every account will use Tor Socks5 proxy.
If Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo has problems with Tor being used, you need to
find a way for it to work. Hotmail isn't complaining about Tor as far as
I know, Gmail does but should be solved and I don't know about Yahoo.

Not OP but multiple reasons for OP's user for not using Linux exists:
"being fine on Windows", "software from Windows missing on Linux, none
good alternatives" and "not being bothered to learn and install Linux"
would be some valid reasons.
Besides, if OP said Windows 7, 8, Vista, XP, or even OS X, just solve it
for that OS. It's like one asking "how can I cook this steak?" and then
someone replying "why don't you eat veggies instead?"

There is a way to compile it yourself on Windows using NSIS but it's old
(last change on 2014-06-05 and it uses openssl-1.0.1h, zlib-1.2.8,
libevent-2.0.21 and tor-0.2.4.22) and may or may not be recommended.
The link of the article and the download of the TXT with the compiling
steps are here: That said, and official way to compile it on Windows (or cross-compile
from Linux) using a manual guide or scripts would be nice.

Yes, there is a verification process for each supported

For Twitter, it's a tweet with some verification ID.
For GitHub, it's a gist called keybase.md.
For Reddit, it's a post on For both last verification processes, it contains some code and a PGP

It started on the alpha development of 4.5[1]:
"This release features [...] isolation for circuit use. All content
elements for a website will use a single circuit, and different websites
should use different circuits, even when viewed at the same time."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why so may exit node IP addresses in the TBB? 
It answered their question about "When it started". And I think the
explanation should be on the 4.5 release page[1]:
Usability Improvements
[...] Tor Browser is also much better at handling Tor Circuits in
general: while a site remains in active use, all associated requests
will continue to be performed over the same Tor Circuit. This means that
sites should no longer suddenly change languages, behaviors, or log you
out while you are using them.
Privacy Improvements
On the privacy front, the 4.5 series improves on our pre-existing first
party isolation implementation to prevent third party tracking. First
party isolation provides the property that third party advertisements,
like buttons, and "mashup" content that is included on one site will
only know about your activity on that site, and will not be able to
match it to your activity while you are on any other site. In other
words, with first party isolation, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ can't
track you around the entire web using their infamous like buttons.

Except that link does not contain Distro-specific packages, in fact,
there is none, asumming you refer to .deb and .rpm. It contains
installers, portable executables in zip files for Linux and Windows,
instructions for Android and the source code.
And of course, Windows is not a NT distro for now.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor source code 
If it wasn't then no one would ever use such a software to achieve as
close as 100% anonymity. The moment some part is close sourced, it can
be used to put a backdoor or a "calling home" code which would give the
real IP to whoever was that code intended to receive.
You should read more about libre and open source software before making
such a question. But to keep it simple:
- The code is open for everyone to compile, modify and redistribute.
- All source code that comes from the official repository (Tor Project
one) has no third-party modification, so the code that you receive
should be as secure as it was developed.
- There are also the binary files released by Tor Project which should
be the product of compiling that same source code.
- Only a program is not secure if you got it from a shady place or you
modified yourself in an insecure way.
And if you think closed source software is more secure then you are
wrong. Not only you nor anyone else can't check if it is secure, you nor
anyone can't modify it (legally) to fix their insecurities until the
developers do so (if they do).
