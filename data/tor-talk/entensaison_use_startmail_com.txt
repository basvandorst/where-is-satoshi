@_subject: [tor-talk] tor project website change / contributing 
Dear all,
Sorry for not replying to a specific mail.
I believe it is possible to extract valuable information from the comments on this mailing list and I would like to help improve the website. So I have a few questions:
Is there a specific group of people working on the website?
How do you communicate and manage your work? (would that be the  group on IRC?) How could I get in touch?
I believe this list may not be the best medium for feedback, is there a place that would be more appropriate and suitable?
(Where the feedback is actually going to be received by the team working on the website.)
Did anyone extract and collect the valuable feedback from this mailing list yet?
Thank you Kevin for creating the guide on contributing to Tor! That saves a lot of time. :D

Of course it is possible for Directory Authorities to collect the IPs connecting clients and publish them.
Yet they could only do it once because they
would lose the trust of their users for ever. ;)
So there have to be other ways to guess what type of new users
use the network.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Revisiting youtube blocking TBB, 
There seems to be a different factor that helps accessing Youtube
through Tor that was discovered by someone else:
When directly opening the URL of a video on Youtube (e.g. from a
search engine) with a fresh identity Youtube considers that to be
suspicious activity.
When you first go to the domain  instead and
afterwards visit the URL of the video you found, that is not considered
to be suspicious. (It's not even related to redirects, you can copy and
paste the URL from somewhere else.)
After a while of browsing on Youtube you get blocked again of course
and need a new identity.
I haven't tested it in a scientific way but whenever I tried it it worked, with
browser.cache.disk.enable = true in about:config.
It doesn't matter what other websites are cashed for that method.
So apparently Youtube considers users to be humans when they
pretend to be undecided about what they want to watch.
Determined people are bots. ;-)
