This can be done by essentially listing the IP addresses for
groups.google.com in the torrc exit policy section, right?  Would
using dig on groups.google.com be sufficient to block the IP addresses
associated with that domain name?  I guess what I'm wondering is this:
is there a way to learn all the IP addresses associated with a domain
name using a tool like dig? Or is it sufficiently more complicated
than that?

Hi, I was wondering if there was much interest in what would
effectively be the opposite of Tor's ExitNodes argument.  That is, it
would be nice to be able to specify that a node should never be a
"preferred" exit node.  -Joe
PS: Barring that, what's the longest set of exit policies that a node
has ever run on? Did it cause problems?  Would it make more sense (in
terms of network efficiency, etc.) to block exits on port 80 or to
have a long (thousands of entries) set of exit policies?  What would
happen if all nodes ran with exit policies that were thousands of
lines long?

@_subject: facility for specifying that a Tor node should not be preferred? 
(I think) What I'm referring to is more simple than that.  It would be
something, a flag, included in the directory information published
that said "this node can't be used in an ExitNodes argument".  Of
course, we'd have to rely on clients obeying that preference... and I
suppose sending a "your node is on the ExitNodes list for this client"
signal to a server would compromise anonymity.
This is a very damn good point... and seems easy enough.  (Here at
berkeley our single sign-on is called CalNet... just in case you
wanted to add to your list :)

@_subject: Running a Tor exit node on an academic network? 
The main reason I didn't want to send my justification document to the
list is that it might expose my strategy (and any deliberation about
it) to the networking people if they monitor this list.  I suppose
that might be the plays-with-lawyers-well side of me.
I could send it if others think it would be helpful (and I guarantee
that I'll write up my struggle next week after they've passed
judgement on my proposal).
I guess I'll just paraphrase the issues and academic stuff:
* They want to make sure that my Tor server is not used to attack
services/computers on the campus network. Proposal: block all exit
traffic to campus IP addresses.
* The Library has electronic subscriptions to certain services that
are based on IP addresses only.  Proposal: block exit connections to
those IP addresses given a list or build a list as needed.  The
eventual list could be thousands of IP addresses long which would have
a undetermined impact on Tor's performance.
* They're not confident that Tor will obey its exit policies. Proposal: include kernel-level software firewall and possibly a
hardware-based firewall device on the Tor box.
* They're concerned about bandwidth (although this one is not a
biggie).  Proposal: limit to 5% of my departments bandwidth (5MBit/s)
and then explore burst settings and see how this impacts our
As for academic justification, in addition to Dean, Sysadmin. and
multiple Faculty supporters I've noted that:
* We have a postdoc that works on reputation systems in anonymous routing.
* Journalism and Law students need a way to be able to communicate
with clients/sources and do competitive analyses in a private, secure
* Faculty need to be able to do research on student and faculty
candidates without exposing their institutional affiliation.[1]
* Students at our school have expressed interest in using our Tor node
to incorporate onion-routing concepts into client-side privacy
protection tools and research tools (like hidden surveys and such).
* Students in networking, privacy, security and cryptography classes
(such as myself) could tinker with our Tor node and get hands-on
experience with onion-routing, cryptography an anonymity tools.
[1] Neither of these require a Tor node (exit or middleman) on
campus... but I'd like to make a convincing case that we need to be
supporting the network if we're going to be using its services.
I would appreciate any comments on any of this... -Joe

Roger has addressed the general flavor of this before. The direction
that we've taken here at berkeley is to push for the network to be
changed (which really needs to happen in the long term).
Specifically, we're arguing to various administrative and technical
committees that the whole damn network shouldn't be trusted by
services that we subscribe to... and instead, the proxy service that
berkeleyites use to connect to library services off campus should be
used on campus too (so that a much smaller segment of our network is

we are essentially saying that it's impossible to do research with

@_subject: TOR on Academic networks (problem) 
It's more a question of having services to which we subscribe trust a
smaller segment of the network rather than the whole darn thing.  That
kind of change would be easy for the subscription services to
implement (changing a rule rather than implementing an authentication
API) and would allow all sorts of anonymous proxies on campus (which
are prohibited by our [MSSBCND][1]).  Currently, if you want to do
something that gets close to an anonymous proxy, you're required to
block all traffic to UC Berkeley IP addresses as well as all IP
addresses that correspond to services to which we subscribe (which is
a Hard Problem).
While the security folks have eliminated IP-based authentication on
campus, it's still the main way that subscription services license
their content (and violations are typically treated by blocking the
entire UC Berkeley network... and you can imagine what a 24-hour
outage of a service like Lexis would do during finals week.). -Joe

This is not an option... I estimated using Netcraft's SearchDNS and
the regexs that Berkeley uses for their library proxy that this would
be an exit policy *on the order of* 10,000 entries long.
As Roger has made clear elsewhere, the current directory protocol
won't scale well with exit policies of this length (or really in
general) and it would be better for the network for these nodes to
operate a middleman node instead.  This is why a few of us on dorky
academic networks are trying to find other solutions. best, Joe

Thanks for the rich response, Roger.  I think we're at least going to
be able to make a very strong case that only our library's proxy
servers should be "trusted" by services we subscribe to... not our
entire network; which would have us with an exit policy of 3k-20k
entries long (and via the agreement that we had to work out with the
System and Network Security folks, we have to disallow all exit
traffic to those addresses... which is a royal pain in the ass, you
can imagine.). -Joe

Hi onion peeps,
I run a no-exit relay that can sustain about a hundred KB/s but I need
to limit to about 4 GB/day to stay under bandwidth caps. I have
accounting set up but what happens now is that it blows through that
in 12 hours and then hibernates until the next day. However, because
server descriptors aren't accepted into the consensus if they're not
much different from the last one, at some point during hibernation my
node appears to go down (presumably until it starts relaying again and
publishes a significantly different descriptor).
Is that the trade-off nodes that do bandwidth accounting have to make?
That is, appear down due to the consensus refresh parameter of 12
hours? Are nodes that hibernate daily by definition not stable? (and
in torstatus and torweather appear down for a large chunk of the day?)

The box running it is behind a NAT and I've port-forwarded to the
Relay Port and Directory Port (I'm using the 0.2.2.22-alpha for OS X

Jan 31 08:54:39.925 [Info] resolve_my_address(): Guessed local
hostname 'foo.local' resolves to a private IP address (10.0.1.2).

However, if I simply click on "Setup Relaying" in Vidalia control
panel and just click "OK" in the sharing pane (to not change
anything), it seems to start routing traffic again:

It goes along happily at least for a few minutes, but then goes back
to the first sequence above and doesn't seem to handle any more

would be to have them change it to tor2web.org).
This came up in a recent brainstorm on using Tor for research purposes
(other than breaking it or fixing it... but using it as infrastructure
for research that needs anonymity to get at certain questions).
It strikes me that this kind of use (a guaranteed anonymous survey),
that involves having people with an interest in the research questions
download and use the torbrowser bundle could have a beneficial side
effect of teaching these participants how to use Tor for web activity.

to past acts isn't something that should be especially instructive.
Still, one can imagine that if you're a hacktivist group that is seen
as being generally "bad" for focusing your efforts on people in
positions of economic and political power, it might be in line with
your views to focus on messing with unbelievably undeniable creeps,
child pornographers and their customers, who are in positions of power

Hi all,
I'd file a bug, but I'm not 100% sure if this is a bug in Tor or something else.
The main question I have is if something changed recently in how TBB
uses Launch Services on Mac OS X.
The symptoms I'm seeing is that when I send a URL to be opened by my
default browser in Mac OS X, it tries to open the URL in the version
of FireFox shipped inside TorBrowser_en-US.app.  That is, it seems to
launch FireFox and then stop.  If I have my main (v 10.0) copy of
FireFox open, it will try to launch the v 9.x version of FireFox
shipped in TorBrowser_en-US.app and pop up an error dialog along the
lines of "You already have one copy of FireFox open...".
If I ZIP TorBrowser_en-US.app up, there is no conflict and all things
sent to my default browser open in the FireFox I have open or it opens
that copy of FireFox.
So, being very na?ve about these things... I'm wondering if there were
changes made to the TBB version of FireFox for Mac OS X that cause it
to present itself differently to Launch Services.
Anyway, sorry to bore y'all... it's just a bit of a pain to unzip and
zip TorBrowser_en-US.app when I want to use it.

Hi tor-talk!
This is a request for input. Pedagogical input, but I'm also aware of
how crazy smart you all are in general!
About six months ago, one of you described vaguely how your servers
were seized by German cops and you explained to the police how Tor
works using envelopes within envelopes.  I had the thought that this
kind of a technique could be really helpful in teaching non-technical
folks how some aspects of Tor works through a hands-on demonstration.
This semester, I'm teaching a class of upper-division undergraduate
students in a Communications department at NYU about privacy.  I want
them to know more about Tor, and thankfully I have Runa and Aaron
stopping by my class. woo!
However, I sat down recently and tried to sketch out how an in-class
hands-on exercise might work that explained some of the core features
of Tor.  Here is the result:
 (Markdown input)
This is my first draft. It really only works with a small class (mine
is 11) or a sub-set of a larger class.  It also doesn't let the
students choose much about the messaging (this is to avoid
distractions like the hunky guy getting a bunch of love letters during
an in-class exercise! ... or more negative versions of the same.).
However, it has some serious flaws... for example, the students don't
"build circuits" through successive tunnels; the circuits are sort of
handed to them.  Also, the way it works right now the instructor is a
central big brother node.  I have tried to think about ways students
could be assigned a message and recipient and then roll dice to decide
the circuit path, but nothing seems terribly workable (and I don't
want it to get much more complex!).  Another self-criticism is that
it's not immediately apparent what part of this who charade Tor takes
care of. ::)
So, having a real physical demonstration of onion-routing may be
unrealistic... but I'm wondering if you all have comments or better
ideas about how to make it realistic without making it terribly
complex (Ideally, smart high school or grammar school students could
be taught about Tor using this kind of an exercise).

Griffin is 100% correct about the leverage you can get from a phone
call rather than other forms of communication with Congrescritters.
My organization (CDT) has been working heavily on CISPA, along with
our allies EFF, ACLU and others. The bill did just (within the past
hour) indeed pass our House.
Before the bill moved to the House floor, our National
Security/Cybersecurity lead (one of my bosses, Greg Nojeim) wrote the
following critique of the bill:
And this week the White House issued a veto threat saying if it comes
to the President's desk in its' current form, he will veto it. The
statement reads exactly like the arguments many of us advocacy
organizations have been making, which is a good sign:
We doubt much movement will happen in our Senate soon and any bill
will look very different.
