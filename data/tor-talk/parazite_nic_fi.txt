I think it would be like 80% of upstream maximum for cable. Upstream is usually (nearly always) smaller than downstream.

Yesyes... Lets ask US Gov, Chinese Gov, Saudi Gov, Cuban Gov, Morality in media, Neonazis, Al-Qaeda, Department of homeland security, Pro-Choice, Pro-Life, DEA, High Times, RIAA, MPAA, BSA for blocking lists... We are co-operative people. Pro-Good. Anti-Evil. We wish to kiss everyone's asses. Welcome to the new Tor network. Suitable for everyone on the planet, all ages all places.
I say we only give some freedom to gain much more freedom. Tactics. When some information type becomes far too risky... then we will not hesitate to dump it... But not without a fight... The path of cyberanarchy requires that you are willing to take risks and pain for the cause... It's inevitable that if Tor stands for free flow of information then has enemies... Resistance...

Ever heard of COPYRIGHT VIOLATION? When we start blocking thepiratebay.org and DeCSS gallery?
Piracy is theft. Are we protecting thieves? And criminal organizations like RELOADED and DEVIANCE?

Individual. Welcome to freedom*.
*( "crime" not included.
Society. I do not take* illegal amphetamines.
*( except on mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun
The society pretends to offer just laws. We pretend to obey.

When freedom is terrorism, only terrorists have freedom.
If this ever comes into the law in Finland, I promise to setup Tor middleman and log _nothing_. Let them put me in prison, if they have the balls to do it.

Fighting this war with volunteers would be the honorable way... Of course... But if that won't do it... Maybe there are other options...
