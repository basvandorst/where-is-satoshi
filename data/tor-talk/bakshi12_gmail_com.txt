@_subject: [tor-talk] How to install tor in Linux just as secure as 
Dear list,
Many many thanks to the developers for this great projects. I am using tor since some days and
it is a great tool for security concerned users.
I am a debian users and tested tor with the tor-browser-bundle. I am interested to install tor
on my system and the benefit of doing so is; I get the updated package automatically when doing "apt-get upgrade"
Hence I have installed apt-get install tor tor-geoipdb vidalia And also configured fireforx to use socks port 9050. The    shows a
tor enable configuration but the log repeatedly warns about dns leaking and suggests to use socks4a (privoxy/socat).
What Should I do here ? I have not found privoxy/socat/polipo in tor bundle package. So what step do I need to configure
my locally installed tor to make it as secured as tor-bundle. Also interested to have Aurora browser as it has specially tweaked
for tor. Is it safe to simply download the aurora from net ?
Thanks in advanced.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor ports 
After starting tor browser bundle, I have seen these 3 new ports.
44036/tcp open  unknown
46712/tcp open  unknown
58536/tcp open  unknown
Could anyone mention what components of tor bundle are using these ports ?

Thanks for all your responses. My target is to not using the git version but the already available
packages in debian. the reason to do so is getting the updated packages automatically when doing
a system upgrade. The TBB provided by tor is really doing its job well. And I am interested to know
its settings so that users can just make such system with available debian packages. Does the custom
TBB uses polipo/privoxy ? I just found the following ports after starting TBB
44036/tcp open  unknown
46712/tcp open  unknown
58536/tcp open  unknown
I can't remember correctly though, but I have read somewhere that current TBB doesn't use
privoxy/polipo anymore after getting firefox version 6. If it is correct, then we also don't
need them; So how does TBB solve the DNS leakage issue ? The correct info is required..
A deb repo for tor customized aurora is also nice. I know the down-loadable TBB is just great.
Still having the knowledge to make such system with available deb packages is always interesting.
I'll look into the links you have provided, mean time any more clues is very much welcome.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to stick with an IP ? 
sometimes to check the geolocation functionality of a site under development, we need to
use proxy for other countries. Can we stick to a specific IP in tor to use it as a proxy ?

Thanks for the startpage; even I was not familiar with it.
Nice to see the movement to honor users privacy.
I propose to add startpage as default search in TBB aurora.

well, find
usewithtor ssh  should do the trick. But it searching port 9050 to connect with tor.
How can I provide a modified port with an option to the torsocks and what is the tor port
running inside tor-bundle ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How tor skip firewall ? 
Dear list,
I have implemented some iptables rule to block some sites based on time module.
The settings are working perfectly fine. But when tested through tor browser,
none are working. The iptables rules are applied on the lan card explicitly
to be sure that the rules are applied on ethernet. Still through tor none is working.
Is not the packages generated by tor passing through the ethernet device ?
Then why the rules are not honored ? Are those packets encrypted ?
Please give some clue. Thanks
