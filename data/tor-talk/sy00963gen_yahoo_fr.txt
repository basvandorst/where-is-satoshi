I have a question about Obfsproxy...
If I correctly understood the function of this package, I tried to use it in Blocked HTTPS network... but when I try to put the proxy of the network I got "You have configured more than one proxy type" and return me to the sitting to change the proxy though it won't work without putting the HTTP proxy!
How to solve this issue OR if you have other solution for blocked HTTPS.... with my thanks in advance

I'm afraid that using a generic proxy _and_ obfsproxy at the same time
is not possible at the moment.
There is a ticket in the bug tracker to track the progress of fixing
this issue [0] and there is also a proposal with the changes to be
made [1]. Unfortunately, the implementation of the proposal hasn't
started yet.

Thanks for the answer... I am using a PC in my work.. The PC is a part of the local network and I am not the admin on my PC (can't install programs, can't write on USB flashs, can't enter msconfig, ..etc.).... If I good understood your answer, that's mean the admin of PC (the same of system admin of my PC, I think) can track all my activity on the PC.. that's right???

Generally speaking, a network admin can see that you are using Tor
(the packets moving), not what you're doing over it (the packet
If 'network admin' also means 'systems admin' of the system you are
using, then they can see everything.
If use of Tor is prohibited in that environment, find another place to run Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on Asus DSL-N10 
Hi All,
I have the modem/router Asus DSL-N10E connected to a PC via?Ethernet?cable. I am using Tor on the PC without any problem...
AFAIK, there is no version of Tor for my mobile Nokia 5800 xp. I 'd like to know if it is possible to configure Tor so that all connections via the modem will pass through Tor.... so I can connect my Nokia 5800 xp to the modem via Wi-fi and "proxy" my connections on it...
Is it possible and how??
