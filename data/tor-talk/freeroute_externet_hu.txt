@_subject: Tor with ssh port forwarding 
There are 2 hosts.
Host 1 is at home (Debian-testing).
Host 2 is at my workplace (WindowsXP Pro)
I use Tor with Privoxy at home (host 1). Firefox with Torbutton plugin
works fine. So it seems everything ok.
At my workplace I use (WindowsXP, host 2) SSH port forwarding (with
Putyy) for webbrowsing. At Firefox in preferences, in connection tab I
had to set Socks host: localhost, port: 1080, using Socksv5.
I would like to use the Tor network from the host2 over SSH
portforwarding using my Debian host(2) at home.
Is it possible? If so, how can I do it?
