I've heard variously that Tor does encrypt my communications with my
entry node, and also that it does not. Which is true? Can my ISP sniff
my communications with my entry node?

Thanks. Then I'm a little perplexed about why it's preferable to use a
limited number of entry guards to avoid traffic analysis.
If the connection between me and the entry guard is encrypted, and all
I'm telling the entry guard is "please pass this encrypted stream to
next specified tor server", what is the danger? Can the entry guard
see my traffic, or do they just see another layer of encryption?

Seems the simplest solution would be to, by default, disallow Tor from
accessing the local network, including what it discovers to be its
externally accessible IP. Then anyone who wants to allow local access
can explicitly turn on whatever they think is appropriate.
