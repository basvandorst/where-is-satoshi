What are you trying to do?  If you're trying to run Tor in a VM then
download T(A)ILS from  and boot the ISO in
VMware or VirtualBox.

Just upgraded from Tor Browser Bundle 1.0.14 to 1.0.17 for Linux i686,
running on Debian lenny/5.0.6. Getting glibc errors:

guess this reflects a change in the build environment for TBB?

You can place your profile in a separate location (USB, TrueCrypt
archive, etc) and then start Firefox:
  /path/to/firefox -no-remote -profile /path/to/profile
It still relies on some system libraries so it's not completely
self-contained, but leaves no trace in your home directory as far as I
can see, and should be portable given that the appropriate libraries
are installed where you need them.

This is the same when running more that one FF profile at any one
time, regardless of whether you're using Tor or not.
Order doesn't matter for me, just remember to add the '--no-remote'.
TBB appears to do this for you - if you run strings over ./App/vidalia
you get in part:
    /App/Firefox/
    /Data/profile
    Data/profile
    /App/DefaultData/profile
    Data/plugins

@_subject: Per-Tab Torbutton 
Ugly? I'd say quite workable. Allows for separation of different
functions, e.g. profiles for Facebook, work, play, and as you point out
Tor and non-Tor. Put different profiles on different desktops/workspaces
and/or use different themes and you can reduce the likelihood of
visiting the wrong site in the wrong profile. Also allows for building a
fairly simple portable environment.
It's not as straight forward as just clicking an icon, but none of the
privacy-enhancing tools are.

Thanks Erinn ... tried that and it didn't work. Doesn't remember
settings even in the current session, let alone across restarts. I've
poked around a little more now and found a way to make it work:
- edit Data/Vidalia/vidalia.conf and set:
    AutoControl=false
- edit Data/Tor/torrc and set:
    SocksPort 9050
That sets the control port to 9051 and SOCKS to 9050.

Just downloaded TBB 2.2.32 for Linux
(tor-browser-gnu-linux-i686-2.2.32-3-dev-en-US.tar.gz) and was surprised
to find FF set to automatically check for and download updates. This
seems like a significant change, and I can't find a record in my
archives, nor in a quick scan through the changelog.
Was this deliberate and did I miss something?
P.S. Otherwise the new version is great!

Thanks Erinn,
I've also discovered that with this version FF defaults to saving
passwords, and that there a 4 CA certificates present for DigiNotar and
2 for DigiNotar B.V.
The first isn't a huge issue, but according to the changelog for 2.2.32-2:
* Update Firefox to 6.0.1, with an additional patch to exclude
  DigiNotar completely
I've also had a quick poke at a few older versions (the only ones I have
- 2.2.25 (FF 4.0.1)
- 1.1.3 (FF 3.6.13)
and both only show 1 CA cert for DigiNotar. Stock standard FF 6.0 also
only had one, and it's now gone completely from 6.0.1 ... so why the
presence of four in TBB?

Yes, first is checked, second is not -- all looks good.
I observed this logging into FastMail, and at the time checked the FF
settings and confirmed that saving passwords was enabled. I now can't
reproduce this -- I've re-extracted the TBB from the original
distribution, checked that saving password is _off_, and verified that
it _doesn't_ offer to save passwords. I'll just assume that _I_ did
something wrong unless I can reproduce it ;-)

On 2 February 2012 17:52, Fabio Pietrosanti (naif)
I guess it isn't the page which is obsolete, but rather that the
required tools aren't distributed with the TBB.  I quite happily use
torsocks with the TBB, and maintain a local installation. It may be
prudent to ask the question "what is the purpose of the TBB?" My
observation over several years is that The Tor Project has moved from
supplying software which required a reasonable amount of technical
knowledge to install, use and maintain, to a much simpler bundle that
pretty much anyone can download and use. The obvious trade-off is that
there are more limitations. You generally can't simplify things
without limiting scope. I would guess that we're in a transition phase
at the moment, and that when it is feasible (i.e. more manpower within
the Tor Project itself) we may see more functionality included.
Until then the page listed above is certainly useful for people with a
technical background to get up and running. For others then TAILS is
probably a good solution.
Nice solution, but Windows only? Mind you, that may be enough to solve
the solution. Are there any stats on %age of TBB downloads for the
various operating systems?
Something like TAILS in a VM using NAT helps to solve that problem, as
well as other problems such as email clients leaking local hostnames,

The Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) is what you need:
Just extract and run.

Depends on how you define anonymous. As you point out the remailer
networks are pretty much dead.
You can sign up to Tor Mail and FastMail via Tor, and then access both
either through a web interface or via IMAP (Claws Mail works well as a
lightweight IMAP client, and seems to play nicely with Tor). FastMail
requires a pre-existing email address for its free account, but 10
Minute Mail (or Tor Mail) can help you there.
 , Search the archives for some discussions about Tor Mail ... not
everyone is happy with it. (I am!)
There are Tor Browser Bundles for Windows, Linux, and OS X.
Torbutton has been through some changes, and comes in the TBB. As the
web page says: "Users should be using Tor Browser Bundle, not
installing Torbutton themselves":
Mike may have more to say, but the design doco should cover everything:

Not sure about OSX, but under Linux you can edit the
'start-tor-browser' script and change the line:
./App/vidalia --datadir Data/Vidalia/
to be:

This just starts Aurora. Obviously you will need a running Tor
instance for it to connect to.
