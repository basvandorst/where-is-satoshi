Yep, we're down right now. Sorry about the inconvenience. We're
expecting to be up and down for a little while while we make some
fairly comprehensive overhauls. In the mean time, publicbt.org, and
openbittorrent.com should work for you.
If anyone wants to stay in the look about our 'scheduled' downtime,
and other hidden-tracker-related goodness,  on twitter
has all the news.
