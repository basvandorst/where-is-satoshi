Please see forwarded messages from tor-relays below.
The problem: A user suspects interference with traffic on exit connections.
Users ad-hoc solution: The user has defined his own (too short?) list of
trusted exits.
Proposed long-term solution: Use existing web of trust systems to let exit
node maintainers sign their exit nodes fingerprint to obtain a
"Trusted"-flag. Maybe also let users sign relays fingerprint to obtain
higher trust score.
The objective of the proposed solution is to compile an as comprehensive as
possible, publicly available, list of trusted exit nodes.
Exit node maintainers should already be aware of the implications of
running an exit node and have taken the advised precautions. A signed
object including the exit nodes fingerprint could also include a statement
of compliance with exit node guidelines.
As my own exit nodes IP address is already traceable to my person, I would
have no problem signing off on the integrity of my exit node, and in my
case also my ISPs.
I run an exit node,
and I'm also quite new on the list and learn new things about Tor everyday,
so please bear with me.
I do not have a full understanding of how the DirAuth works, but how about
an out of band verification process, to ensure the trustworthiness, for
exit nodes specifically. This would minimize the hazzle for people who
wishes to use trusted exit nodes, and maximize the number of explicitly
trusted exit nodes. Since relay maintainers are already publicly listed and
traceable I would not have any problem signing off on my own, and a few
other maintainers I know personally, exit nodes.
As per
exit probability of the Top 10 exit relays with the highest consensus
weight is 12,2046%, and per
exit probability of the Top 10 fast exit relays is 11,2452%, so you
wouldn't need many maintainers joining a signing/verification scheme to
account for a lot of the bandwidth on the network.

Inline below.
Check. per the default exit policy:
reject 169.254.0.0/16:*
reject 127.0.0.0/8:*
reject 192.168.0.0/16:*
reject 10.0.0.0/8:*
reject 172.16.0.0/12:*
no exits allow access to their local addresses. If you were to use an exit
with accept *:* I'm still not sure Tor would allow you to connect to *the
exits* local IP-addresses.
192.168.254.16 is a local host on your local network, which you do not need
to use tor to access.
If you still insist on accessing the service via Tor you would have to eg.
portforward your routers Public IP to the service.

Since you have gotten three independent answers, I am sure you are as
welcome as anyone to post to this public list.
I can see how all answers are more or less technical, but they all
reiterate that you cannot use Tor to access private addresses.
"These addresses are characterized as private because they are not globally
delegated, meaning that they are not allocated to any specific
organization, and IP packets addressed with them cannot be transmitted
through the public Internet." -
Meaning you can't access private addresses via the public internet, nor Tor.
It works for you in an ordinary browser because your computer is on the
same local network as the weather station, e.g. on the inside of your
router/internet connection.
You can therefore safely access the weather station with a normal browser,
I will not recommend you changing proxy settings in Tor-browser unless you
are 100% sure what you are doing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Idea: Public verification of exit nodes and their 
Thanks for the feedback! =)
I am thinking of basing a tor exit web of trust on  API
and at least requiring to have http proofs on, and dns proofs in relation
to, the exit nodes as well as including public key fingerprint in
http proofs (txt-files) can easily be supported in the existing source like
DirPortFrontPage is now.
A user would then be able to compile a list of all nodes supporting keybase
verification, filter it if wanted, verify the information and choose to
trust all or a specific set of the nodes supporting this scheme.
Please note  ( is currently
in "Private Beta", I have invites if anybody is interested.
If any exit node maintainers would like to support this scheme as an
independent initiative, please let me know so we can see if there is enough
support to justify the effort.
Any concerns about this model?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Network properties of a social graph formed by relay 
I find this very interesting in relation to the idea for a web of trusted
exit nodes based on Inline below.
In regards to an independent network of trusted exit nodes, I would be
willing do disclose my status as an exit node maintainer, and my connection
to the few other exit maintainers I know personally, as we are already
traceable by IP and our nodes are listed as family members via Onionoo.
Would a directional trust edge be useful in this context, or would it just
complicate the trustworthiness of the entire graph?
I suspect the graph would be quite sparse if an edge requires bidirectional
Maybe this could be turned into an advantage in the web of trusted exit
nodes scheme, e.g. only use exit nodes within N edges of specifically
trusted relays or only use exits connected to specifically trusted relays.
Please see the thread "Idea: Public verification of exit nodes and their
maintainers - Fwd: [tor-relays] specifying your own entrance and exit

@_subject: [tor-talk] HardwareAccel: Current proper use??? 
The documentation is still somewhat vague on the best use of the
"HardwareAccel" option.
I could not find a definitive answer in the archives or in
 claims
no intervention is needed in regards of aes-ni accelaration, but I would
like to add an explanation or source to this recommendation.
If my CPU supports and have loaded aesni_intel on linux with OpenSSL is
1.0.1.j-1, should I leave HardwareAccel off or explicitly enable it?
What does "*built-in (static) crypto hardware acceleration*" refer to?
Dedicated hardware, CPU-support or...?
Best regards
