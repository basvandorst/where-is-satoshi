@_subject: Maximize Anonymity Services but Minimize 'Abuse Like' Behaviors... 
Tor Gurus -
So, I have just started running a Tor Relay. Currently I am in operating in
bridge mode, with a exit policy that rejects all. I am concerned about
having to deal with DCMA or other complaints, but I want to balance that
concern with providing real privacy value to the people who need it.
As, such I am wondering what options there are for providing low-risk but
high-value services.
Any ideas ?
Some (probably naive) ideas I had were:
- Permitting exit to key informational resources (e.g. wikipedia services)
- Permitting exit to top 5 or 10 web mail services (e.g. google mail,
hotmail, yahoo, etc.)
I am curious how others have balanced their desires to contribute to Tor...
Thanks, Erik

Gregory and Ted -
Thanks for sharing your ideas. The challenge here runs deep...
At this time, I am measuring the 'effectiveness' of my contribution to Tor
though the bandwidth that is used. In 2008, I had over a TBytes of bandwidth
that I didn't use. (Purchased as a part of my server hosting service,
I have re-configured my relay to also accept inbound connections. I feel
like this will have a low probability of creating friction between my
service provider any myself, and as can be seen in the attached graph is
using more bandwidth... So I am able to both contribute bandwidth to the
project and avoid the problems associated with being an exit node.
I am considering running a separate exit note later - just getting my
mind wrapped around all of this...
Again, thanks for your comments...

@_subject: TOR Exit via Squid 
Hello -
In light of recent events I have added news and information sites to my exit
policy (previously I was 100% Entry Node). Examples include wikipedia, cnn,
etc. (I know that Tor is primarily an tool for gaining anonymity and
privacy, but it is also a tool for getting around restrictions some nations
put in place to limit peoples access to news and information.)
To make the most efficient use of my bandwidth, I would like to direct these
port 80 http sites to a squid cache running on the same Ubuntu host as Tor.
What would be the best way to accomplish that? Does anyone else on the list
have any advice regarding this?
Thanks for your insights and help,
( Nickname artofinfosecTOR1 )

@_subject: Safe destinations 
Gregory -
I have been struggling with a similar question. I do not have an answer as
to the perfect list of 'safe' sites (wikipedia is at the top of my list).
But I have authored a bash script to turn a list of domains (
mail.google.com, wikipedia.com, etc.com) into rules....
The following script looks for a file called torTarget.txt, and for each
FQDN it:
- Looks up the first ip on the DNS record
- Assigns port 80 by default
- If the word "mail" appears in the FQDN, then I assume that this is a
webmail service and force port 443
- Adds google talk
The output needs to be placed in the torrc file by hand and replace any
existing policies.
Here is the script:
# If dig fails, try installing the dnsutils package
# e.g. sudo apt-get install dnsutils
echo "# Target List Generated `date`"
echo "
cat torTargets.txt | sort -f | while read site
 if echo $site | grep -q "mail"
 then
  port="443"
 else
  port="80"
 fi
 dig +short $site | sort | head -n 1 | while read ip
 do
  echo "ExitPolicy accept\t $ip:$port    \t# $site "
 done
echo "ExitPolicy accept\t *:5222 \t# Google Talk"
echo "ExitPolicy reject    *:*"
echo "# End of Exit Policy"
echo "
