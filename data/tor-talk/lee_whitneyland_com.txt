@_subject: [tor-talk] Is this a practical vulnerability? 
I was reading a paper on discovering hidden service locations, and couldn't find any reason it shouldn't work in principle.
However being that I'm a Tor novice, I wanted ask here.
In a nutshell they propose throwing some modified Tor nodes out there that modify the protocol enough to track down the location.  It does take some time, but it doesn't seem like years.
Any comment appreciated, here's a link to the paper:

There are actually two possible explanations for what you saw:
Maybe the test request you made logged your IP and then it could be
anywhere.  Also as you know people are constantly scanning subnets for
I don't discount government snooping, it just seems a little crude for
them to be tripping alarm bells on a small unknown target.

In the US it seems there is a lot the FBI could be doing about Tor
services like these but I'm not sure what their staff's level of knowledge
Do FBI computer guys stick mostly to "forensics" using off the shelf
tools, or do they also have software developers and people who consider
theoretical attack vectors?

Eugen do you have children?  Not attacking you based on this but I'm
curious how it affects perspective.
In my mind it's pretty easy to drawn the line, things that have victims
should usually be illegal and things that are unpopular but don't hurt
anyone usually should be legal.  No slippery slope necessary.
