I use it at home until I run into a site that doesn't work well with tor.
I like adding hay to the haystack.

Hash: SHA1
Hey all,
I've put together a guide on how to use Mumble (TCP only!) with Tor if
anyone would find that sort of thing handy:
Some stuff that's been pointed out since posting:
* If someone could monitor the connections being made to the server and
log which times of the day people were connecting at, they might be able
to tell when you're asleep and not talking and thus tip off what side of
the hemisphere you're on, assuming a non-night-owl sleep cycle.
* Assuming it can be detected after being filtered/optimized to a pulp,
the hum of the mains frequency of the electrical grid might tip off
which country you're in based in.

Just added a CC-BY 3.0 badge to the post, feel free to remix/share/sell/etc.
A mumble server as a hidden instance is something I thought about but I
couldn't figure out where to start at the time. Glad there's some
documentation on it though, I'll take a look! A few friends of mine have
been experimenting with mumble over tor a lot so we'd definitely be
interested in spending some time trying out a Whonix mumble hidden service
That's roughly what I meant by location-anonymity, but I realize I never
really explained the term in my post; I've added an addendum to the post
which explains that and lists potential issues mentioned here and in the
HeatSync Labs mailing list.

Tor will work with Raspian, which is based on GNU/Linux and thus compatible
with the GNU/Linux Tor browser bundle. Firefox in general runs a bit slow
on a raspi though, just an FYI.

Ah, right. I remember the architecture issue now. I ended up installing the
tor package and pointing Iceweasel to it, now that I recall.

@_subject: [tor-talk] WebRTC via Tor 
Hash: SHA1
Hey all,
I've been experimenting with using WebRTC in a browser using Tor with
Twilio to see if it's not totally impossible to do voice communication
in a way that anonymizes location (source IP). The problem is that
Twilio WebRTC requires UDP connections over ports 10,000 to 60,000 and
at least from my research (correct me if I'm wrong), Tor doesn't do
onion routing for UDP traffic. As an alternative to WebRTC, there does
seem to be a Twilio Client Flash option* which is TCP-only, but eww
Flash. Any ideas on how to shoehorn UDP traffic into Tor-friendly TCP or
do something else that would produce basically the same effect?

Good point; The project in mind will be using a plain wifi connection,
with the carrier out of the picture as far as the device (BeagleBone
Black) goes, so this should help mitigate the issue, assuming the
network's firewall doesn't get in the way.

I'm unsure at which points in the connection there should be a VPN; Should
it basically look like below?
Alice running Tor --[OpenVPN connection in TCP mode via Tor]--> Machine
running Tor --[Connection via Tor to Mumble server or some other voice data
jumping point]--> Bob

Idk what metric to measure its security against, but mumble over tor does
