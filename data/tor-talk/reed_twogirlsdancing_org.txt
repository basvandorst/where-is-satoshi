@_subject: [tor-talk] I don't understand two things about the node "freja". 
WHOIS data talks about the owners of the IP blocks, and while you can infer some information from that, what you cannot infer is the actual geographic location of devices actually living at those IP addresses (this is why GEOIP companies like Maxmind exist, to fill the gap of missing information).? So in this case, you are correct that RIPE says the 194.88.142.0 - 194.88.143.255 range is owned by ORG-HTPL1-RIPE which has a physical mailing address located in India, but that does not mean that the servers associated with that address block are actually physically located in India at all.? This happens all the time and is nothing remarkable.
Also, don't put too much credence in the reverse DNS entries associated with actual ISP routers - that information is commonly missing, outdated, or just flat out wrong.? Sure, some providers do a decent job populating useful tidbits in the reverse DNS, but many don't bother at all.
