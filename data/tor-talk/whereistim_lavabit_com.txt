@_subject: [tor-talk] 4 hops in tor? 
was looking at Vidalia's Tor Network Map, and rather than the usual
3 link chain, I saw a 4 link chain.
Did they change something, is this an anomaly? What's going on with
this? I thought Tor was hard-coded with a 3 link chain?
Here's the servers, in the order they were chained (copied right out
of the Tor Network Map window):
