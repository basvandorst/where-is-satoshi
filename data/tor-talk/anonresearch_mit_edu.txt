Hi all,
We hope to collect a few more responses on this survey. We would very much
appreciate your input in illustrating the importance of anonymity and
anonymous access in different contexts. As a reminder, the survey is
completely voluntary and responses will be anonymous.
Thank you very much for your feedback and time.

Hi Tor-talk,
We are a team of researchers at MIT, and we would like to ask Tor users to
participate in a research survey. This study is focused on the importance
of anonymity and anonymous access in various contexts, and will take
approximately 20-25 minutes to complete.
To thank you for your valuable time and perspectives, we will be awarding
prizes of up to $100 by lottery if we collect sufficient responses. It is
optional to accept a prize.
You can learn more and take the survey at this link:

Your input is very valuable to our study, and we would be extremely
grateful for your participation. We look forward to getting your feedback!
