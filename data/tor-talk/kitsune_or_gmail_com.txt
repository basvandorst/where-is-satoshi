It sounds mighty suspicious, in my opinion.
If I recall correctly, directory mirroring is based on HTTP (hence, why
it's encouraged to host it on port 80 for "fascist firewalled" folks, if
at all possible). Therefore, it would be vulnerable to any "fundamental"
attack (i.e., based on the nature of TCP or HTTP) that any Web server
would be.
Given that the system you mention doesn't seem to be a Tor node, I say
that if it's not an attack, then something's pretty weird.
I'm no expert, but I say block the offending system. Does anyone else

Hash: SHA1
AFAIK, when activated, Tor will:
1.) Download some directory information - this can be quite a bit, if
it's the first time Tor's been run on a particular install;
2.) Send some data for the purpose of opening up a few circuits, so it's
ready for use when an application wants it.
If by "a long while" you mean more than a couple of minutes, I'd say
that's pretty odd - that's much more than is needed for a directory
download (IIRC).
By default, Tor will act only as a client; it will not relay data, nor
act as an exit node.

Your cable modem should work fine; the minimum requirement for a Tor
server is only 20 kilobytes per second each way.
I'm running "kitsune" over a Cox cable modem, through a Linksys WRT54G
(v4, running the Thibor 3rd-party firmware); believe it or not, it's
actually a shared machine, not dedicated.
I have "kitsune" throttled to 20KB on BandwidthRate, but allow 40KB
under BandwidthBurst; those figures aren't solid, as I'm always
experimenting with things (I have to balance the usage of the network -
with several computers - against services pointed toward the Internet).
You might be able to allow more bandwidth; you'll have to play with the
values, if your connection dies while leaving them blank (which causes
Tor to attempt to automatically judge your bandwidth, IIRC).

My Linksys router is a wireless one - albeit with a custom firmware.

too flaky.

63-character pseudorandom key, for my own piece-of-mind...)

As long as the bandwidth you're passing through is relatively low, you

1.) The Linksys WRT54G v4 was the revision of that model with the most

2.) If you're running a high-bandwidth node - and if you're not, it'd be
a waste of that nice shiny box of yours (unless you have it do other
things) - I doubt 8192 connections would do it, and you probably should
take Mr. Holstein's suggestion.

In any case, I set my node up as "middleman" from the beginning. Given

allows me to provide capacity to the network, while avoiding most of the

before leaving the network completely. Taking an occasional peek at my

One site provides modified scripts for running Tor in a chroot() - which

Hash: SHA1
Just a couple ideas I had, regarding the issue of German Tor nodes and
the upcoming data retention policies; keep in mind that my own knowledge
regarding the Tor network isn't all that deep, so these may be flawed.
However, let's suppose that we're in a time when German Tor nodes are
now actively keeping logs of all connections. What would be the best way to:
1.) Protect the anonymity of Tor users as much as possible, while
2.) Attempting to allow some way for German Tor nodes to contribute to
the overall capacity of the network.
If I read things right, there are two things - barring client
misconfigurations or other SNAFUs - that are likely to reveal the
identity of a client:
* An adversary owning all three Tor nodes in a circuit, in which case
the client is *definitely* screwed;
* An adversary owning the entry guard and exit node in a circuit, which
may allow an end-to-end attack.
So, what if a maximum of one German Tor node were allowed in a circuit?
Would that achieve both numbered goals?
Given the logging, it might be wise to not allow the German node to be
the exit node; I'm not sure about the entry guard.
I would think that a German middleman node would be safe, though, right?

This is a good point. Since crypto is being used to enforce access

not modify, or delete). Only the intended recipient would be able to
read the message, anyway.
So, maybe an HTTP-based solution would work, after all... it could be as
simple as having a script on the server, which would allow file upload

IIRC, a GPG message in encrypted only once - even if there's multiple
recipients. It goes like this:
1.) A random key is generated.
2.) The message is encrypted with that random key, plugged into a
symmetric cipher.
3.) That random key is encrypted with the public key of each recipient,
and appended to the message itself.
So, the recipient would reverse that process: Use their private key to
decrypt the random key, and use that in the appropriate symmetric cipher
to decrypt the message.

IIRC, if you have a TrueCrypt volume and you want to permanently disable
access to it (instead of relying on its plausible deniability

1.) Securely overwrite the first 1024KB of the volume; IIRC, this
contains the actual, fixed volume keys, encrypted with the credentials
you've chosen to use. Without this, even the proper credentials will
fail to open the drive.
2.) TrueCrypt offers the use of keyfiles as credentials, in addition to
(or even in lieu of) a passphrase; these can be kept exclusively on a
removable medium of some kind (e.g., USB drive, CD-R). Destroy the
medium with the keyfiles, and decryption becomes (basically) impossible.

* Dm-crypt in Fedora 7 (AES-256, LRW);
* Persistent (passphrase-based) root filesystem encryption from
install-time, via Dm-crypt (AES-256, CBC:ESSIV-SHA256), and ephemeral
("random-key") swap area encryption via the same method (and identical
module, cipher, and mode-of-op), in Debian 4.0.

(If someone presents a convincing argument as to why this is harmful,

I don't know if it really makes all that much of a difference for Tor,
though, because I don't fully understand the internals of how it deals
with individual packets. For example, I know that it wraps them in three
layers of encryption (for standard outproxy traffic), and pads packets
that are less than 1500 bytes with random data up to that size, before
they're encrypted into cells (to prevent traffic analysis by size).
What I don't know is, are we talking about encapsulation (like a VPN
would do), or a complete rewrite of packets as they're encrypted into cells?
I'm pretty sure it's closer to the latter, due to:
1.) Tor offering a SOCKS interface (which means applications are aware
of a proxy being there);
2.) I remember reading that Tor prevents many OS fingerprinting

being reliable.

@_subject: A way to allow firewalled exit nodes [Was: Re: getting more exit 
Hash: SHA256
I think that adding a "firewall-piercing" rendezvous-type system (like
STUN, or I2P's SSU) to allow heavily-firewalled nodes to act as exits -
ON A STRICTLY VOLUNTARY BASIS (i.e., off by default) - might be a nice
I can think of one potential problem, though - I don't know if such a
firewalled exit could be reliable, from the client POV. The problem
isn't so much from the general way connections are made on the Net, as
it is in the trust-no-one model of how onions are formed.
It's possible, but to preserve both the encryption from the injection
into the Tor clould to the exit node, and the TNO model, here's what
we're looking at:
1.) A firewalled node - we'll call it Router X -  opens a number of
connections (the more the merrier, since it will complicate traffic
analysis) - to non-Guard and non-Exit nodes; we'll call these Routers A-M.
2.) Router X would publish an extended server descriptor, which would
include the list of nodes it's meshed with - in this case, Routers A-M.
3.) If a client, choosing nodes randomly, includes a firewalled node, it
would take that published list into account, so that it wouldn't put
adjacent layers on the onion that couldn't be handled by its neighbors.
(So, the client couldn't put a layer for Router Z right over Router X,
because Router Z wouldn't be able to contact Router X.)
4.) So, let's say the client layered an onion to pass from some random
Router Y --> Router A --> Router X. When the transfer starts, Router X
can act as an exit, even though it's firewalled.
It's an interesting solution from a pure hackery point-of-view; however,
the Occam's Razor part of me seriously questions whether it'd be worth it.
For one, we'd be talking about a serious overhaul of some code; in
1.) The directory protocols would have to allow for these extended
2.) The client code would have to take the meshes of firewalled exits
into account;
3.) Of course, the server code would have to allow for a firewalled exit
 option.
I thought I'd throw it out there, just for the hell of it - but my
personal opinion is, Tor is actually working far better than I had
expected. It's improved over the past year or so, and I don't think a
solution like this would be worth either the work, or the potential risk
of new bugs or attacks it could open up.

Hash: SHA256
(much snippage)
"Kitsune" started on an old PII 300Mhz with 256MB of RAM; I've since
migrated it to some AMD Duron 800Mhz/512MB RAM hardware a friend gave me.
The Debian Etch install on the hard drive was transferred in its
entirety via a dd command, although I did swap the generic x86 kernel
for a K7-optimized one.
"Kitsune" had been a guard node before, while on the PII; on the Duron,
it's been running for about a month, and has been marked as
Fast/Guard/Stable for most of that time.
It's important to note that - as some have noted here - the stability of
the perimeter router/firewall is VERY important. I used to have a WRT54G
running HyperWRT/Thibor at the "front lines;" it crashed A LOT (it
couldn't handle the large state tables that were being generated).
After migrating "kitsune," I killed the 54G's routing function, and
converted it to a switch/AP only. The old PII that used to run
"kitsune," got a pfSense install.
It's VERY stable, and the traffic shaper is really nice; I haven't had
to use any traffic limitations on "kitsune" itself.
So, bottom line, the processing requirements aren't bad, but you need to
be careful with what you do for a perimeter router/firewall. =:oD

I should also note that with the pfSense box, I used a three-interface

I just used catch-all rules for all traffic coming from and going into
the DMZ, putting it in pfSense's "P2P" queue - the lowest priority.

The Privoxy port can be changed by editing its config file; Tor can be

I think he's looking at an observer from the local network as a threat
model. If so, such an adversary wouldn't have the benefit of knowing
what accounts are being accessed via the Web, if they go over Tor (only
an agent of the company who runs the mail service, or law enforcement
would have that benefit).
Of course, this opens up a whole new can of worms; AFAIK, Gmail is the
only major Webmail provider that can be used via SSL on the Web
interface (by starting the session with an HTTPS URL, i.e.,
 ; if you don't, it'll switch to SSL only for the
~ login, but actually transmit the subsequent pages [and the email they
contain] in cleartext).
(If you've used the account outside of Tor before, Gmail would - of
course - know your identity; however, an observer on the local WLAN
would not.
Also, since actions over the lifetime of a circuit [~10min] can be
potentially linked [from what I've read], you'd want to get a new nym
after you're done with Gmail. On *nix, this can be done with a SIGHUP;
on Windows, one way is to stop and start Tor via Vidalia.)
So unless you're using that one - or using something else to protect
your content - my hypothesis in the first paragraph is not a good one to
use in practice.

If security is a big concern - and you have a dedicated machine for

set up a DMZ.

project, but it would take quite a bit of work.

It's okay. =:o) After all, the hidden service side of things is quite a
bit more obscure than the (likely) most common use of Tor - an anonymity
 layer and inherent outproxy to the normal Web.
(About that anonymity layer... Although I've never seen it formally
described as such, I could see it being considered as a separate logic
layer in the TCP/IP stack, since it is such a general-use TCP conduit.
It'd look something like this:
[Network Access]
Just for kicks...)
If it became mainstream and massive, yes. However, I don't have much
hope for that, if history is a guide for the most likely development of
the future [1]. Such a ubiquitous deployment will most likely (though
sadly) remain the "wet dream" of hackers, civil libertarians,
crypto-anarchists, and cipherpunks.
The network has - though far from ubiquitous - grown quite a bit over
the few years. Around 2005, the paper "Low-Cost Traffic Analysis of
Tor"[2] mentioned there being around 50 Tor nodes; IIRC, that's
mushroomed to around 1,600.
(I suppose that such a mushrooming effect could cause someone to look
Tor through another historical POV, though - that of the Internet
itself. It did something similar... =:oD )
[1]: This is one reason why I try to study as much history as I can,
BTW; many mistakes are made in the present, which could have been
avoided if the one who made them had learned about certain aspects of
the past.
[2]: True, it's a shame some of these things aren't more mainstream.
That thing about Usenet also strikes a chord with me; when a technology
with many years of history behind it ends up circling the drain, it's
just sad.
Old doesn't always mean inferior, or even obsolete/superceded; a good
example are the Unices, which started way back in the 1970s (IIRC).
Sure, things have changed a lot since then, but the basic model is still
there. The core of the Net runs on it (and if more of the users did, we
might not have half the bedlam going on right now! =xoD ).
This is one reason why malicious Tor exit nodes and scripts/applets/etc.
on servers have had such success in de-masking Tor users - it's not a
silver bullet. Users have to configure their applications carefully, as
well as be careful what they let pass through Tor (either explicitly
entered, or implicitly leaked).
As it stands right now, Tor is for people who have a decent knowledge of
how to secure themselves - and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
I'm glad to see the warnings that have been put on the front page of the
Tor Project site - but the fact remains, sheep will be sheep. Not
everyone will pay attention to it - and they very well could suffer the
(Amazingly, a lot of the "sheep" they found, I would think belong in the
"wolf" category! =xoD )
The exits and servers I mentioned previously were those I read about as
proof-of-concept - but most of them are so feasible (requiring so little
effort), that a teenager could probably do it from his basement.
Just imagine what a repressive regime could do...

exit nodes can - and have been known to - spy on cleartext. They can
also alter things being passed through; this is how Torment and similar
tools attempt to "demask" those who haven't properly secured their browser.

All things being equal, I agree: The larger the potential cloud, the

isn't something that should be done unnecessarily.
However, in a totalitarian situation, it's wise to make the trade-off of
"shallowing" the node pool, to gain the much larger benefit of greatly
reducing the chance of the government censoring the exit - or worse,

I've been thinking about the recent threads involving our recent

However, such an approach relies on the ability to tie an IP address to
geography. This led me to something that while simple, could break this
entire approach:
What if the Chinese government were to open virtual server accounts in
other countries? Assuming they had massive connectivity (which some
locations do - there's such a place near me, which hosts among other
things, Google), malicious Tor nodes could be run on them.
Since excluding by geography would be useless, they'd only need to sit

It really depends on whose privacy you're worried about. Allowing exits
only on ports that typically are used with end-to-end encrypted
protocols*, should help limit the amount of information the FRA can
gather; while they can tell what's being accessed, they can't get the
much deeper "psychological" info that could be gathered from content.
I don't think that even with unencrypted traffic, that it would be a
major threat to the anonymity of the clients entering the network
somewhere else** - the main worry, as I see it, would be if they thought
it was from you.
As mentioned before, the best you can do as an exit node (for your own
protection), is to allow ports that tend to be used with encryption.
*: Others have pointed out that many ports which are commonly associated
with encrypted protocols may - in practice - actually be used without
encryption. This can be due to protocols which support either plain or
cipher mode (e.g., Gmail's SMTP on TCP 587), or to deliberate hackery
(e.g., someone could run a standard HTTP server on TCP 443, in order to
get around an ISP block of TCP 80 [although if they're at that level,
I'd figure they'd just use HTTPS for the extra privacy =;o) ]).
(In a manner of speaking, I'm doing repurposing of a port in this manner
- - although Tor uses SSL, I'm using TCP 443 for onion routing, rather
than its "normal" purpose as an HTTPS server.)
**: FWIW and IMHO, I believe that much of the privacy and security of
clients not only has to be, but *should be* left to them. Stopping
Darwin and bottle-feeding those with inferior skills and/or capacity
only drags down the human race. Those who can, will learn; those who

However, there are three personal rules I stick to, when using accounts

1.) Any account used for anonymity, must be created through Tor, and
never have been touched without it.
2.) Any such account must, of course, always be accessed through Tor
after its creation.
3.) Any such account must be considered expendable; i.e., if an exit
sniffer stole the credentials and either locked you out or impersonated
you, it wouldn't be a real problem.
If you'd rather not have to follow Rule 3, make sure you use accounts

As far as the larger issues: Technically - as Tor is (mainly)
decentralized - there's really no "policy" regarding what node operators
do with their nodes.
However, content filtering or the gathering of information* - for any
reason or in any form, even if the owner believes it to be for the good
of the users - tends to get a very cold reception. This is from both the
personal liberty and anti-government surveillance standpoints.

Two extremes of the scale I'm talking about would be:
* Fully centralized, like plain ol' client/server;
* Fully decentralized, which Gnutella comes close to.
Now, Tor's data-carrying architecture is primarily decentralized -
anyone can run a node, and these nodes are chosen (more or less) at random.
However, the idea of directory authorities clouds this a bit* - and the
fact that there's a directory authority consensus system, clouds it even
If there was a single directory authority, I'd consider the system to be

You should know that VNC is considered an insecure protocol; the wise
thing to do, is to allow it only to run over a secure tunneling protocol
(e.g., SSH, or a VPN program).
This is not only because many variations of VNC don't provide their own
encryption (remember, exit nodes can sniff - and they can see WAY too
much if you're using plain VNC!), but also because such a protocol would
strengthen the authentication required to get in.
This is what I mentioned in my last email - Tor is good for concealing
this sort of thing.

are, they end up going through those three guards (unless, of course,
something happens to them).
2. A recommendation in the past to prevent correlation attacks, is to
run programs which need different "nyms," through separate Tor

@_subject: Prebuilding circuits? 
Hash: SHA256
First, a bit about Tor's circuitry:
Tor doesn't build circuits to sites - it builds circuits from a user to
an exit node. That exit node then makes "normal" (i.e., unencrypted)
connections to sites on the user's behalf (along with many other users).
(The exception to this are hidden services, which connect two circuits
together at a rendezvous point.)
I'm assuming that the site you mention is a "normal," unencrypted Web
site - i.e., port 80; let's call that site, Site X.
For a fixed amount of time - by default, 10 minutes - Tor will re-use
circuits. So, if you go to Site X, and then go to another site - let's
call it Site Y - before that time is up, then Site X and Site Y will use
the same circuit, come out the same exit, and have the same "virtual
identity" (the IP you take on from the point of view of the sites).
Next, a plausible explanation of what's going on:
Depending on the nodes that Tor chooses to build a circuit through -
usually chosen randomly - it may take a bit to build them. Overloaded or
slow nodes might be part of the cause of this.
If it's really a problem - or if you want to get some extra speed - you
might add this to your torrc:
CircuitBuildTimeout 5
That tends to favor fast nodes that aren't overloaded, at the tradeoff
of some of the added anonymity that an unlimited "Tor cloud" would provide.

My setup is Firefox 2.x, with the development-branch Torbutton (which
provides a LOT of extra control), NoScript (I pretty much cleared the
whitelist it comes with, and enabled every possible block), and CookieSafe.
I find CookieSafe to be handy, because you can block all cookies by
default, and allow them on a site-by-site basis. It also can be set to
make all cookies last only for one session - which, of course, I do.
(To not do so opens you to a slip-up where you connect without Tor with
a "dirty" cookie, or a type of intersection attack involving persistent
cookies which I've only heard rumors about.)
Generally, there's three rules I follow, if I want to log into a site
using Tor:
1.) The account was made on Tor, for anonymous usage, and will only ever
be handled through Tor. You never want to log into a site with
identifying info with Tor (as it opens you up to a stream correlation
attack at the exit) - plus, it just kind of defeats the point. =;o)
2.) Any account I use through Tor, is considered expendable - since on
sites without SSL, it's definitely possible for an exit to sniff the
login and take it over (this also stresses the importance of the first
3.) If a site or service offers it, I use the SSL version, since it
greatly increases resistance to things like stream correlation and the
lifting of credentials.

- From : "Simulating a Global Passive Adversary for Attacking Tor-like Anonymity
We present a novel, practical, and effective mechanism for identifying
the IP address of Tor clients. We approximate an almost-global passive
adversary (GPA) capable of eavesdropping anywhere in the network by
using LinkWidth, a novel bandwidth-estimation technique. LinkWidth
allows network edge-attached entities to estimate the available
bandwidth in an arbitrary Internet link without a cooperating peer host,
router, or ISP. By modulating the bandwidth of an anonymous connection
(e.g., when the destination server or its router is under our control),
we can observe these fluctuations as they propagate through the Tor
network and the Internet to the end-user's IP address. Our technique
exploits one of the design criteria for Tor (trading off GPA-resistance
for improved latency/bandwidth over MIXes) by allowing well-provisioned
(in terms of bandwidth) adversaries to effectively become GPAs. Although
timing-based attacks have been demonstrated against
non-timing-preserving anonymity networks, they have depended either on a
global passive adversary or on the compromise of a substantial number of
Tor nodes. Our technique does not require compromise of any Tor nodes or
collaboration of the end-server (for some scenarios). We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in tracking the IP address of Tor users in
a series of experiments. Even for an under-provisioned adversary with
only two network vantage points, we can accurately identify the end user
(IP address) in many cases. Furthermore, we show that a well-provisioned
adversary, using a topological map of the network, can trace-back the
path of an anonymous user in under 20 minutes. Finally, we can trace an
anonymous Location Hidden Service in approximately 120 minutes."

Privoxy) and may cause extra info to be leaked, I believe that all of
that should be taken care of in the browser - and on my setup, indeed it is.
Therefore in such a scenario, SSL is the best thing to use if you can
get it, since it prevents the exit node from sniffing your traffic - the
one big privacy hole left in Tor.
(That's also a common misconception - Tor doesn't magically provide
end-to-end encryption for the whole Net. Traffic can still be sniffed at
the exit and after the exit, unless SSL is being used.)

IMHO, the problem isn't that filtering would be in place - this should
be the option of each node operator, and there are other exits - but
that there's no way for the Tor client software to avoid such a node
entirely when accessing a blacklisted site.
Basically, if you used the ACLs in Squid in this way, clients that want
blacklisted site "X," might still pick your exit (in a semi-random
fashion), since you're neither listing Site X as a Reject line, nor
blocking port 80 exits entirely.
So, Squid would send back an error of some kind, and that client would
be stopped cold until they either restarted Tor, or sent a NEWNYM/SIGHUP.
That would not only be annoying as all get out in manual use, but would

The first hop is an entry guard, which stays the same in order to
prevent a well-known type of attack which could reveal your idenitity.
You needn't worry - the first hop has no way of knowing what you're
doing, or even who the last hop in your circuits are. =:o)

Yes, it's referring to end-to-end attacks - which are usually timing
attacks; however, fingerprinting attacks (based on the total filesizes
of known target downloads, since encryption doesn't change the size of
data) are possible in theory, as well.

If you absolutely must use potentially unsafe plugins, scripting, or
whatever with Tor, you might try setting up a Linux or BSD virtual
machine with transparent proxying.
That way even if the software violates the proxy rules - or Heaven
forbid, attempts a deliberate circumvention - it will still be caught
and anonymized (if TCP) or discarded (if UDP/ICMP).
Information on transparent proxying:

Supposedly, one of the exit node operators is going to try opening

I'm all for opening 465/587 by default, but I also understand the

(perhaps unknown?) sites running them in an insecure fashion.
I think an experimental approach could be greatly enlightening in this case.

I know that for several days, my relay was out of commission

I did a "date" command, and the clock was set properly.
kitsune seems to be working now, but the traffic has been erratic; I too
seem to have gotten more before than I do now even just a few hours
after restarting the node.
On a lighter note: Maybe some of the bandwidth hogs left? ;)

Although it's a longshot, another possibility is that someone is
chaining one or more additional, non-Tor open proxies onto the end of
their proxy chain.
They may do this if they want to hide that their proxy is backed by the
Tor network from a destination admin, for example - or if Tor is
blocked, and they know of a one-hop proxy that isn't.
There are plenty of other ports to do this on, though - many of them far
more common than 1080 (and SOCKS) nowadays.

@_subject: Tor speed 
Hash: SHA256
This is why in the roadmap for the future of the Tor project, one of the
goals is to switch from TCP to UDP as the transport protocol for the
overlay connections.
Indeed, UDP would be more efficient, since any TCP protocol being
tunneled within it would have its own sequencing, etc.; it also would
(potentially) allow UDP-based protocols to not only be tunneled, but
tunneled efficiently.
(It's interesting that this problem was discussed regarding the Hamachi
zero-config VPN program; it uses UDP for its encapsulated packets, and
allows any enclosed TCP streams to use their own sequencing.)

@_author: F. Fox 
@_subject: Tor speed 
Hash: SHA256
If I understand this correctly, node-to-node transmission would still be
adding another layer of TCP sequencing to any underlying TCP connection
sent into the network on the client end; however, that new TCP sequence
wouldn't be "in the clear" as it previously was, but would be
encapsulated courtesy OpenVPN's UDP engine.
It's still there, however.
Ideally, node-to-node transmission would *not* add another TCP
sequencing layer; any TCP-based protocol which wants to use the network,
would do its own housekeeping. The overlay network shouldn't do any
sequencing of its own.
(I'm going to have to look more into this SCTP stuff, by the way; I
don't know much about it, and it sounds interesting.)

That would be helpful, but not perfect. Ideally, TCP wouldn't be used in
Tor's operations at all; any TCP-based protocol using Tor would do its
own housekeeping. In other words - just as it does in things like
Hamachi and OpenVPN - Tor acts (from the program's point of view) just
like the underlying packet network.
In short, tunneling TCP over TCP is something that should be avoided
when possible, since only one set of TCP sequence numbers should be in
play at any given time, for any given socket.

This has been a "condoned" use of BT and Tor for a long time, and indeed
AFAIK, is the only "reasonable" use of P2P on Tor.
It's not perfect - since transfers are still done in the clear - but it
does thwart the current most commonly used method for enumerating users
(i.e., scraping the tracker). It also uses almost zero bandwidth on the
Tor network.

@_subject: Torbutton : please offer better user agent choices 
This thread reminds me of a nice analogy from a previous thread:
If Internet users are like the characters from the Peanuts comic strip, then Tor users - *regardless* of any settings they may use (Torbutton, UA, or otherwise), by virtue of their use of a Tor exit node IP alone - look like Charlie Brown.
Since nothing can change that Tor users are Charlie Browns, the key to maximizing anonymity - making it as hard as possible to tell any one of the Charlie Browns apart from the rest - is to make sure all the Charlie Browns look exactly the same.
This is what the standard UA in Torbutton attempts to do: Make sure all the Charlie Browns have that same yellow shirt with the zig-zag stripe on it. We'll call that UA "foo."
Now if one of the Tor users - one of the Charlie Browns - changes their UA to "bar," all of a sudden that Charlie Brown has a RED shirt on.
A red shirt - the "bar" UA - would stand out quite nicely against 4 million yellow shirts - the standard "foo" UAs. :o)
