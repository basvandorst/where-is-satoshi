I opened it in Foxit Reader at 1:00am Pacific Time (on Sep 30), after
saving it to my desktop. I also opened it an hour ago, but in-browser
(on accident). My IP is 76.28.208.179.
I expect that the first access will show up, but not the second.

Why not make a fully true integration with bitcoin in the network? Bitcoin
could be the fuel: who wants to use pays, who want to help the network with
a exit node receives, simple like that. The exit nodes could define a
minimum to receive, for example: 0.001 BTC / MB or 0.01 BTC / MB or for
free, and the user could define a maximum to pay, like 0.0005 BTC / MB or
even free. Then, the network would find the right matches / patches. In a
free market more you pay, more you get in speed and reliability. The
networks could continue free but slow and faster if paid.
Forget the intermediate nodes for now, think in this situation:
- A, B and C is final user.
- D, E and F are exit nodes.
A is poor and set his configuration to spend max of 0 BTC / MB.
B set max pend of 0.001 BTC / MB, and C is rich, so he set max to 0.01 BTC
D is a very nice guy, and rely a exit node for free. E has a few network
resources, so he set min. to 0.001 BTC / MB. F is even more poor, and he
wouldn't be a exit node anyway, so he set the min. to 0.01 BTC / MB.
A would use D as exit node, with the rate of 0 BTC / MB.
B would use D and E as exit node, with the avg. rate of 0.0005 BTC / MB.
C would use D, E and F as exit node, with the avg. rate of 0.00367 BTC / MB.
F won't earn too much because he is very expensive and few users would use
that. But E could make more money even charging less. The market will
decide the equilibrium.

Thank you Matt. I'm sorry if I didn't have a good idea, you were convincing.
I figured it could have implications for anonymity but imagined could exist
a solution (there is always). About the numbers, it was just a totally
random number, I'm sorry, I could used more real numbers as example.
The problem in charge (too much) an exit node is that no one would use
that. Imagine if all users set the max spending to "zero". In this case, it
would be useless to charge a exit node even with 1 Satoshi / MB because no
one would use it anyway. The market would find a good number, and my guess
is that would be ridiculously cheap to have a good number of exit nodes and
free would give almost the same experience as today we have.
It is not a matter of poor is less important, but create proper
incentives. For example: I'd like to run an exit node, but I'm pretty sure
if I do that the government here in Brazil will hunt me. It is very
dangerous to do that in Brazil. So, for me, it does not worth to risk it
for free. I'd put a very expensive price to my exit node because I want
little flow. Remember: I don't run an exit node anyway.
Well, if this is not good for Tor as it was designed, I guess I could make
a fork in Tor project and implement that, couldn't I?
Thank you!
