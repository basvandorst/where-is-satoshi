i assume you might block these server via the exit-rules of your server.
which of course would not solve any problem per se, because the people
wich trigger the abuse complains would get routed through other exit
nodes, so the abuse notes would just go elsewhere.

it is a firefox message:

i made some good experiences by using
  me -> tor -> ordinary webproxy -> target site
on sites which try to block tor users.
of course you would want to use a webproxy which does not send
X-FORWARDED-FOR etc headers.
also, be sure to not do such things for submitting very important data
in plaintext (like, without https) because the proxy might log you.
but as others noted, doing such things is not exactly what the fine
people which made tor hat in mind, and if a website is blocking tor
for what reason ever, you should consider not using it at all.
most if not all content on the web is accessible via various sites,
no need for ones blocking proxies.

tor project patched the firefox included in TBB so it doesnt need polipo.
so, if you use the browser bundle, you dont need it,
but i am not aware of any dangers if it exists - it just dont get used.
if you dont use it otherwise than for tor (and then its only needed if you also installed tor, and not use the bundle) you should be ok with deleting it.

the firefox from the browser bundle gets started with the --no-remote so it runs independently from your installed firefox.

you could just put the survey on a .onion-site to ensure only tor-users can vote.
maybe you would still consider blocking the tor2web-proxies.
but you would save the hassle from ensuring you tornode-list is always which also has timeframes between node-goes-up and node-is-listed. just but pushing people with no experience through getting and using tor the first time
and then rejecting them "for no reason" might be somewhat suboptimal.

my mistake.
i thought "they are in the internet, they have ip's", but their tor-side goes through tor of course, which hides the ip like always.

i just set up a .onion to test.
i get the X-FORWARDED-FOR-headers, yes.
the reported ip belongs to the university of stanford, which is definetly neither the location of me, not my onionsite.
maybe this is the ip of the tor2web-site which was given me from their if thats true, it would allow blocking tor2web servers, but since its not the ip of the user visiting the site that would not be necessary in the first place.

i have to admit, i kinda fucked up my test - i used tor to get to the tor2web proxys.
my bad.
without tor, i would get my own ip, as stated originally.

click "new identity" in vidalia.
or wait 10 minutes and tor will automagically create a new circuit.
both will not kill existing connections.
