@_subject: Warnings on the download page 
I found most applications on a Windows system respect the settings
configured under Internet Options (i.e., XP SP 2 under Control
Panel->Internet Options->Connections->LAN settings, or through IE7 on XP
SP2 under Tools->Internet Options->Connections->LAN settings). I have
also found that most applications on a Windows system know nothing about
Firefox's proxy settings. I am not writing this from a Windows box, but
I wonder if WM10 is the same.
Also, I tend to firewall off all connections that go to the outside
world when using Tor, except those connections by Tor itself. On
Windows, I generally use per application settings through my personal
firewall. For example, Firefox is configured to only be permitted to
connect to the local system, not the outside world, and WM10 is not
permitted to connect to anything. Not perfect by any means, but it helps
to prevent accidents.

@_subject: another unusual connection 
I am not sure that is what is happening. For example, it may be that the
reachability checks are being performed on the current (and correct) IP
before the update to the suggested new IP is put into effect.
Anyway, I suggested making an explicit verification of the reachability
of the current IP before updating to a suggest new IP as a means to help
counter incorrectly suggested new IPs. E.g., if the old IP still works,
ignore the suggested new IP; if the old IP does not work, update to the
suggested IP. (This sort of thing doesn't solve the root issue of how
best to establish trust in the IP address observations of directory
servers, but maybe it helps a bit. Once you get an accurate IP
suggestion, you are protected against incorrect suggestions until such
time as you become unreachable again, when the game starts all over and
you were back down anyway.)
There are probably many ways to perform that check - one way I threw out
there was to explicitly call the check reachability routines before
updating; another (and perhaps better) way might be to only process
suggested new IPs when Tor notices that it is no longer reachable.
Unfortunately, neither did I supply a working patch to implement
explicit verification of the old IP as an additional workaround for the
root issue nor did I even confirm the cause of the successful
reachability tests.
Scott, you have been quite vocal in this area, so perhaps you might want
to put in some legwork here. I am sure the Tor team (and the rest of us)
would appreciate such efforts.

FYI, there is a brief flare up of discussion on the North American
Network Operators' Group (NANOG) mailing list about Tor. If interested,
the thread in the web accessible archives kicks off here -

@_subject: TLS Man-In-The-Middle Vulnerability 
The vulnerability itself might not effect Tor, but the OpenSSL
workaround for this vulnerability of disabling renegotiation by default
in 0.9.8l [1] might not play nice with a Tor implementation.
