@_subject: [tor-talk] Structured Information on Tor 
Hey Guys!
I am a total Tor-Newbie and wanted to know if there is any structured source of information, like in a 200-page book or so, that teaches me everything important? Most of the information I could find is scattered over many sites. I downloaded a few papers from freehaven, which is super interesting, but it is also quite academical information.
