The CSS  rule that is being blocked by NoScript can be used to fingerprint you, specifically can be used to detect what fonts you have installed.
How this works is that you define a set of fonts and tell the client ``if you need to use these fonts but don't have them you can download them from me''. The client then requests the fonts it doesn't have. From this the server knows what fonts the client doesn't have and by process of elimination what fonts it does have.
This can be done with zero JavaScript and only CSS.

Hello, I'm the creator of a new fingerprinting website, Think Panopticlick but with a lot more tests.
Many of the tests are even designed specifically to catch the Tor browser bundle out, for instance the Math/Tan function returns a different value based on what your underlying operating system is, so it's easy to detect when a browser is lying in their user-agent string.
I would greatly appreciate if you visit the site and fingerprint yourselves since it will help me refine the techniques and improve the site.
I'm adding more tests every week and if you have any ideas or suggestions I'd love to hear them.

It's a fairly standard thing to do on a fingerprinting website.
It helps us group related fingerprints together.
It allows us to look at how often repeat users who change their IP could have been tracked using their fingerprint.
It allows us to better identify sets of spam fingerprints (although this isn't such an issue since the CAPTCHA was added).

Yes, the TBB and IceCat handle screen size calculations in a way
different to most browsers.
This results in odd screen sizes and screen sizes that can be affected
by zooming.
I wasn't aware that the character sizes test was also affected by
zooming (this seems to be the case on even regular browsers), thanks for
pointing that out.
I'm also concerned that you got "nullxnull" for your CSS screen size
test, I guess that means the test is bugged.

I have left the tests in, but excluded them from the fingerprint uniqueness calculation.
I've also grayed them out and made it clear that the tests have problems.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB users, please give 1 minute of your time for science 
Hello, Tor community!
Could you please do me (and science) a favor and go to my site (  ) using the Tor Browser Bundle and submit a fingerprint, making sure to fill in the optional questionnaire?
At the moment I'm working on detecting a person's underlying operating system and browser family using their browser fingerprint.
The aim of this is to detect and defeat browser spoofing.
The number of Tor Browser Bundle users who have gone to my site and done this is extremely low, so I'm not able to properly train my detector to defeat the TBB, nor am I able to gauge how effective my detector is against the TBB.
Rest assured that I will not use your data for anything malicious, nor will I attempt to deanonymise you in any way.
Thank you!

You can't build defenses to attacks that nobody knows about.
And if I'm the one who develops the attack it'll be public knowledge; can't say the NSA would be so gracious.

I'm a PhD student.
I have no employer other than my university.
All my work is done with the intention of publishing it in academic journals, conferences, my blog, and my thesis.

When you submit a fingerprint it sets a cookie in your browser that prevents double submission of identical fingeprints.
This could cause you to appear unique upon resubmission.
The ad-block thing is probably caused by one of Tor's advanced security features. It happens when the security slider is on high, but not low.

Yup, that's me!
Thanks for reporting that error.
Sadly I was not able to replicate your bug (I tried the extension on IceCat and the site worked fine, but I couldn't try with IceWeasel because it doesn't seem to be available on my machine).
Looking through the logs it seems like there was some kind of special characters in your fonts list that the database didn't like, which is odd because I know it works with stuff like Chinese characters.
I hope I'm not asking too much, but it would help me greatly if you could go here  (another person's site) and fingerprint yourself, then PM me your js_fonts.
I don't think they collect any data if you're worried about privacy.

In case anybody is interested, a write up of my work so far: Not strictly related to Tor because I didn't have enough Tor test data, but what I plan to do in the future if I get enough Tor data.
