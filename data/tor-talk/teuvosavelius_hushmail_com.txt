@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Advice? 
Sieg Heil!
I think that TOR is a great software product. It allows me to host a
Nazi terrorist site completely anonymously. I am quite worried though. Apparently some people do not like our
opinions. Therefore I would like you to do a security scan of my
Web: TOR2Web: Tor: Just scan as hard as you like, I won't sue you!
Does anybody know if F-Secure works in TOR? I am trying to improve the
information security of my website by installing F-Secure in my TOR. fsecuremies at tormail.org will sell me pirate F-Secure and then we will
be completely unhackable!
