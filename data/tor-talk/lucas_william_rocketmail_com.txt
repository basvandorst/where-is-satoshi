If this means exiting there, and not just building circuits with only US
nodes, which wouldn't be great for anonymity, read this quote from the
Please note that this might be harmful for your anonymity as well. An
adversary knowing your exit will be in the USA would probably try to
watch all exits in the USA, while monitoring your connection and
correlate traffic, based on timing and volume.
"ExitNodes node,node,?
A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes and address
patterns of nodes to use as exit node---that is, a node that delivers
traffic for you outside the Tor network.
Note that if you list too few nodes here, or if you exclude too many
exit nodes with ExcludeExitNodes, you can degrade functionality. For
example, if none of the exits you list allows traffic on port 80 or 443,
you won?t be able to browse the web.
Note also that not every circuit is used to deliver traffic outside of
the Tor network. It is normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those
used to connect to hidden services, those that do directory fetches,
those used for relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end at a
non-exit node. To keep a node from being used entirely, see ExcludeNodes
and StrictNodes.
The ExcludeNodes option overrides this option: any node listed in both
ExitNodes and ExcludeNodes is treated as excluded."
"ExitNodes {us}" (without the quotes "")
to the torrc (can be edited with any text editor) should do it.
