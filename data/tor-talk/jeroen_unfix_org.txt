This is the important part, it states that the address is not available.
Did your properly shutdown the old version?
And/or did you maybe put a listening address in your configuration?
Check "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.WARMACHINE\Application

Windows 2000 was EOL'd by Microsoft last year, but I don't see why newer

Does not matter what service you use, they all fail under the pressure
of organizations that want access to it, be that legal or illegal.
(The bigger problem with the context of the article is the 1984'ish
behavior of an apparent legal entity).
As long as you make sure you properly encrypt your messages (PGP or if
it is available for your medium OTR; and don't let your keys fall in the
wrong hands, but then again rubberhose anyone?) and use Tor to access
the service so that figureing out which IP you came from is useless as
it is an exit, you should be pretty fine.
PGP + email's prime weakness is the fact that the from/to/subject are
passed in the clear and that rubberhosing you or planting a bug on your
person/computer yields those precautions futile.
Then again, it also depends on what your adversary is and what you are
trying to protect, note also that not everybody has just one single
email address.

Does not matter, given enough power/money/force your adversary can walk
into that colo and use vampire taps to replug (both power and network)
your box without you noticing anything and monitor the rest from there on.
As for TPM, who build that piece of hardware and are you sure that a
copy of your keys are not kept elsewhere?
At one point or another they just apply rubberhose crypto thus don't
make it too difficult.

Of course you are raising the bar, but that is the only thing you are
doing, as the adversary can still walk in, be that with a warrant making
it legal, or just by going in. Criminals don't ask for your Ok.
How exactly does that matter? It will already be too late and your full
hardware will be off site in a location that you don't control, still
running fully and no way for you to stop them from doing what they want
to do with it, be that freeze the memory or any component needed.
Or do you watch that video screen 24/7 like in the movies with the
guards on duty being shown a replay? :)
Yes, nice things like mercury switches, glueing the whole thing together
and other such tricks can even deny physical access, but really, what
are you trying to protect there? :)
I am surprised if you are that paranoid that you trust the hardware in
the first place. You do realize where the designs come from and where
they are built right? :)
Yes, you will know that your hardware from that point is untrusted, but
who says it was not before?
Nope, but that is why a vampire tap can also do power, so they can
remove the box from the rack/location that you have as 'secure' and then
they can do whatever time consuming things you want.
Unless you have a full remote kill switch in there packed with some C4
or so.
But that is why I mention rubberhose: if they want to get the info in
there, they will politely ask you for them instead.
Did you build that TPM token? I am just trying to give obvious hints
here and above etc...
For that matter, did you write and audit 100% of the code, oh and not to
forget the compiler that you are using for that code? And what about
that little video camera just behind your screen, did you notice it
already? ;)
Like everything in live, it just depends on how much you care.
For most people though, unless you are doing super secret evil stuff,
just using a Gmail account with PGP in combo with SMTP/IMAP is good
enough(tm) a security measure.
Local filesystem does not matter, as you won't see it. Thus if the video
cuts, the only lesson you learned is that the box is not to be trusted
anymore, but then it is already too late in most cases as they also
likely know who is footing the bill, just follow the money and thus
where your bed lives.
I don't have to bother breathing, not everybody is Darth Vader, it
happens automatically more or less as a reflex for most people and there
is so much fun in the world without having to consider conspiracy

Google for Vampire Taps. You won't notice a thing unless you have very
very sensitive voltage etc measurements happening.
Like everything else (eg how many locks you have on your house), it all
depends completely who your adversary is and how much protection you
require against it. In the end it will come down to a delay for the
adversary and annoyance on your part with the problem that if the
adversary wants your information hard enough they will 'nicely' ask.

We actually fully agree with that and it is also what I am writing.
Though with the added point that the deeper you dig yourself in, the
quicker your adversary might just use the mighty rubber hose technique
instead to get to your so dearly protected secrets, depends all on your
adversary of course and how valuable that data is for them and you.
Thus your threat model involves not trusting any service where software
is running of an external organization.
Though as stated before, I do really hope you verify 100% of your code,
including the compiler, not forgetting about the microcode in CPUs
According to the above statement having a box in a co-lo thus is mostly
fine unless you don't trust the hardware that is.
Why are you then arguing for live video streams and glueing everything
Then again, if you think you need to do all of that, go ahead.
Speaking of that NIC, ever wondered how much code runs inside that PHY
in there? :) *wink*
Of course that is not the one you or anyone else wants as it will
inflict personal injury. Fortunately it tends to be the last resort and
you must have pissed off the adversary first before they take this step.

No idea about the proper venue. I am sure that if it becomes to annoying
one Tor Project member or another will kick the persons involved and
nicely ask to move along somewhere else.
As I stated, if you have sensitive measurements then you can detect
this. What you then do upon this detection is a different thing.
I have not stated to disagree with that did I? :)
As a side-step: The server being (software) hacked is IMHO way more
probable then somebody getting physical access to it. Thus having a
disposable key that allows reading of data that is stored also means
that if that process is hacked that they have full access to the key, no
sensor protects.
Back to the original message: The prime point at the start of the thread
was that it is completely unsafe to use a service like gmail for storing
IMHO one can 'safely' use those kind of service up to a certain level
given that you either don't use it for communications you don't care
that they are leaked or if you do care about that that people sending
email to it use PGP so that only sender/receiver is disclosed when they
do get access to that store. (assuming adversary is unable to crack your
PGP crypto of course ;)
That is more a trust issue. If someone has access to it, you better know
it before they can do anything with it. Also "Corporate" datacenters
have the tendency of allowing stuff to be lost in the noise ;)

Yes, that is an awesome method for very cheaply keeping your emails safe
from prying eyes. (though unless one has an external server polling the
mail and saving it again, it is not applicable to gmail, especially as
one does not know how much data gmail and other such services retain as
they don't guarantee deletion).
The big advantage is also that there is no keying material that can
cause the mails to be read, unlike most 'crypto filesystems' which tend
to keep the crypto keys in memory for both reading and writing to the
filesystem, thus if somebody is able to hack a process that can write
(your incoming mailer) they can generally also read those files.
The only missing component in the above puzzle is then to mirror new
mails asap to a set of other hosts to act as a backup, just forwarding
them to the other boxes with a rewrite can solve that though.

While that indeed solves (at least makes it really hard to get to it ;)
the problem of they keys in memory/cpu-regs, it, at least from what I
can see now, does not solve the problem that if a process which is
allowed to do read/write operations on your fully encrypted disk to read
that data when somebody has compromised that process. One thing to keep
in mind. Your mail-directly-PGPd setup does not have that problem.
Gotta love the part about diving with a USB stick, now I just have to
get one of those to try out if it survives at least 50m ;)
But why don't you then just use only that USB stick instead of the SSD?
Though of course the SSD is quite a bit faster, they have 16GB 3.0
editions and 64GB USB2 versions which should mostly be sufficient and
half the space of the SSD in the box.
And presto, everything is safe. And in a similar way one could setup a
Gmail account and have a hidden service use the Tor network to exit to
gmail and poll it over IMAP to fetch the email, find the mail store then ;)

The internet does not handle (D)DoS attacks either.
Wow, you are a fish with wings and you can even write emails ;)
DoS attacks by overloading a network are always possible and the only
real solution to that is to add way more capacity than the adversary has.
As with Tor there is no way to identify the source node, implementing a
rate limit on source is impossible. Doing rate limiting on the
intermediate nodes would just cause a network-wide ratelimit and also
impeed other traffic.
And if it was a proper DDoS attack you would run out of filtering
resources before you ran out of capacity.
In other words: not much you can do about it but add more nodes with
more capacity.

(I mentioned in my mail that one cannot do that for Tor, implying one
can with the normal internet, because of the absence of a source

Even those nice nullroute communities do not make those packets arrive
at your upstream links and fill them up. Only way to do that is then to
simply stop announcing the route in question to the links that those
packets are coming in over. (this is the strategy taken by most IRC
servers btw, which then keep on announcing the prefix on the local IX
where most of their clients likely exist)
Do also note that is a generally a limit to the amount of source
filtering one can do. Every ACL added can bog things up and one really
does not want to keep state.
But it all depends on the attack, in the end more have more capacity is
the only really thing one can do about this.
Unfortunately Tor implies (TCP + TLS/SSL) connections and thus lots of
state. Thus wiping out a node would just mean creating enough
connections which should be easily done on most nodes in the directory
given a properly sized botnet.
If you would introduce something like hashcash, does the source node or
the intermediate node have to do this hashcash calculation?
I do hope that verifying the hashcash is then factors lighter than
generating it. Do note though that some
If the source has to do it you are going to transfer a bit of text from
the source to the intermediary node and thus the intermediary node might
learn that way what the real source is.
I don't think this is very viable, even though it has merit, I would
say, change the subject line and go for a proposal and we'll see how far
it can solve something.

That would also require them to distribute those coins and to first of
all mint them.
How does one distribute those coins? That is, how do you know how much
to give to a certain user? The nice thing about bitcoin is that the
minting is done by the user, if you can mint a lot then you can use a lot.
There is no such thing as a stupid idea, there are ideas though that
don't apply all too well to the situation ;)
I think it is interesting but quite infeasible to do this.
And to be able to verify you don't only need a centralized mechanism,
but you would also need to setup a connection to that location to be
able to verify that you can setup a connection, which would need a ... ;)
Also, people sometimes already complain that Tor is slow, this won't
help with that too much.
Note that if one does this payment thing, will that pay for a single hop
or for the full circuit? How would one crypt that payment thus avoiding
the node steal it and pay it's own traffic with it?
On the Internet one also only pays their direct peers, thus for the
Tor/Bitcoin model one would then best be off only paying the direct
peers and the peer could then use that bitcoin to pay the link to the
next hop.
If you ratelimit regular streams then that could mean that the regulars
who never pay are thus flooded and the others are easily identified as
they add a payment token (which need to be per-hop).

most people support Tor for: freedom of speech.

I guess you mean your Tor exit node.
Somebody exiting through your exit node effectively attempted to mirror
at the highest speed possible the remote website, those where 85
requests for a variety of pages in under 60 seconds. For the operator of
the website that is apparently a very high rate and abuse-reporting worthy.
Likely an automated client of sorts caused this to happen through your
exit node.
That could work for you, it does not solve the fact that someone is
using Tor for mirroring websites at high speed (good that your exit
allows them to though).
They don't care about Tor they likely don't even know that Tor is being
used for this.
They do care about the fact that somebody is mirroring their content
which in turn might overload their system, but they are calling it a
"RIP", I guess they mean the English 'to rip' not a DoS or something.
They think that rate-limitting should be applied at the user (eg you as
that is the IP they see), while IMHO if they have a rate-limit, they
should enforce it.
A proper reply to them could be:
  If you don't want to have your site mirrored in this fashion, then
rate-limit on source-IP on your side and more importantly implement a
proper robots.txt on your site.
Note that at the moment  contains:
Sitemap: Which is actually an indicator that they want to be mirrored ;)
Of course, as the robot performing these actions is not disclosing it's
real-IP or real user-agent and as that robot is obviously is likely
ignoring any robots.txt, I would not be surprised if that won't help
much, but the rarelimit on the server side definitely will help quite a
bit for their problem, as they seem to have a problem with it.
