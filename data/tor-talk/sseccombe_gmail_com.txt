@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia Bundle 0.2.17 - Editing the torrc file 
Hi. Just updated to the above version. Whereas before, I could edit the torrc file to specify exitnodes, now this is only allowed temporarily ie edit the torrc file from within Vidalia/Advanced tab but it isn't saved. The older version saved the file so the edit was done once and then every time after, it all worked as planned. The exitnodes I want to specify are for the UK.  I need to update this on both Mac OS X and Windows. I'm working with Foxyproxy. Any advice gratefully received. Thanks Susan
