In Settings, you might have to check "Use default iptables". I don't
remember having to do this with ICS, but for sure it's necessary with
Jelly Bean.
It may also depend on your kernel, if you're using non-stock. If you're
using Semaphore, you should also check the option for Netfilter in the
Semaphore scripts app.

It's working here on a Samsung Galaxy S (GT-i9000) with Slim Bean
weekly build 7.5 (Android 4.2.2). The only thing is that I had to use
default IP tables; it was hanging otherwise.
Pretty background, too, and I really dig the bandwidth monitor in the
status bar notification.
