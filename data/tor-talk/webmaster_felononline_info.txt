@_subject: [tor-talk] new tld question 
Sorry if this is the wrong list, but I thought it would be a good place to start.  I'm new to tor and have a quick question...
With the availability of new TLDs,  is there/would there be a concern if someone applied for the .onion tld?   Would this affect the current system?

You mean something like IRC?
Onionet is  a great example.

@_subject: [tor-talk] torchat for chat room? 
Just my personal 2c.   I've installed Chatzilla into the Tor Bundle.  It was easy and since it pulls the proxy information from Firefox, I did not have to configure anything.  And from What I can tell it does not leak personal information.

Your last line of
"but some things need an understanding of  more fundamental concepts before they make sense."
Should be Followed with the other line you used:
"...this is not under the control of the Tor Browser."
Sorry I couldn't resist  :)

Just thought I'd Add my 2c here. Limiting my response Only regarding home Wireless access in the US.   I was involved in a case with just this situation.
According to my lawyer there is no consensus on who is responsible for wifi.  Every State has different laws each one is just a vague.
In NY, if your wireless is secured (pw protected) you are ok.
In NH, you are responsible for all data that passes your wifi point secured or not.
In MA(my state)  there is no specific law...you just need a good lawyer  :)

Found some interesting news on reddit.    I dont know the tech behind it, but is sounds like playing with Clock allows you to get the IP address of the hidden service
Is this something to be worried about?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service Question 
Hello,  Hopefully this is a simple question.
I have a hidden service running on a local computer.   Currently to access it I can either SSH into the 192.168.x.x  address or I can Access it with the .onion address over tor.
My question is can I access the .onion Address Locally   So I dont have the lag/delay with running over tor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service Question 
Im working on redesigning and configuring the site.  Most of the work has to be done using the http: interface.    so after I make a change the refresh of the page takes some time (tor delay)    I'd like to be able to access the .onion site locally so I can work a bit faster.

Hello.  If this is the wrong place for this question, please let me know where to go.
Can wget be used to download from a .onion site?  Where could I setup the proxy information for it?
I currently use the Tor Browser Bundle, Ubuntu 12.04 64bit.

Can anyone suggest a vps provider that is friendly to tor hidden services.   This would not be for an exit node.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS provider 
This was something that has bothered me.   I use VmBox for linux   When Im running a machine there is a windows that shows me a "preview" of the current screen.   Do admins have access to this "preview"     or something similar?
I intend to run a linux server console only. (no gui)   so most of my work will be done using SSH.  The only viewable page would be under the .onion site.       Hopefully as long as the admins dont know the .onion.   they cant see whats hosted.     Non-illegal, but may be offensive in some countries.

anyone know whats going on with tor check?
  Sorry, your query failed or an unexpected response was received.
A temporary service outage prevents us from determining if your source IP address is a Tor  node.

Same Issue with me.  Running Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Until there's a REAL effing way to communicate, 
Hello, Id like to add to this discussion as a personal aside.
When I started using Tor I was a "newb" as it were, with computers.  The few things I knew about the internet was Email and Google.   Thats all I needed.  When I went looking for information on TOR the first place I ended up was the Mailing lists.   I find this process much easier than Forums (BBS)
The more I got into it the more I realized some down falls to the Forum idea.   One being a single point of failure.   If the forum is down, taken down, Blocked, then were do people go?   At least with email even if the list is somehow blocked, the individual emails addresses are still there.   Over the years Ive seen many Forums just go to waste because people dont want to maintain them anymore.
On a side note.  I've gotten to liken the Reddit communities /r/onions  quite frequently.
Just adding my 2c.

On a side note.  Your email title quote "That evey1 can use"    I think thats is a great goal..but may never be achievable.  Your asking for a process which everyone can use.  Where everyone is comfortable.   Being as some people prefer email over forums, and some forums over email.. as well as other forms of communication.  I don't think its possible to find one fit solution for "everyone"
Take for example people in countries where access to a computer is limited, but access to a smart phone is possible.  Sending and email would be easier than trying to log onto a forum on a 4in screen.
This mailing list is a good start.

And here in lies the issue...
  "A platform that everyone can use to communicate...Even though everyone may not be happy about it"
I think email is a simple platform that everyone can use, even though some people (you) may not be happy about it.
Just my 2c.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How easy are Tor hidden services to locate? 
"That said, there are plenty of hidden services out there, and few stories of people breaking their anonymity by breaking Tor. So they're not foolproof for sure, but they're also not trivial to deanonymize. "
Could you elaborate on this?  I have not found a story where "tor" was broken to find a site.  I have found were the site itself was broken..   SQL injection, open ports, bad setups...etc.
