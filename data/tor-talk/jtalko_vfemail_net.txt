@_subject: [tor-talk] Isis smear campaign? 
from the leaked tor-interal log.
If the story breaks and more people look into TPO leadership and the  existing government ties, we need to have a plan in place to protect  Isis before users find out about her previous status as an FBI  informant. We know her association with Ulbricht was necessary to  protect TPO's view in mass media, but future convictions may lead to  more exposure. If the FBI unseals their agreement with her, we need to  have a stategy in place to protect her and TPO.
     Expell her from TPO and claim innocence (worst position)
     Relocate from US to friendly country (DE would be best bet)
     Claim smear campaign and use resources inside the gov to protect  her (this ruins our rainy day card)
     Claim smear campaign and allow her to cooperate while maintaning  a silent relationship with the FBI.
Please continue feedbak on -internal, this is just a quick brainstorm.
I hope.
