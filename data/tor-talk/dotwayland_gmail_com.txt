I have been considering potentially building some type of remote
jumphost for a University research setting that automatically connects
its users to the Tor network and am looking for feedback/implementation
A few assumptions:
1) the users of the host trust me as the operator
2) as soon as they log off of the host, all information about their
usage is purged.
3) would like to do this with Windows, as it is compatible with RDP and
would require less user education.
Basically I want to provide an environment for users that requires
little or no configuration on their part that they can use to browse the
web anonymously. One of the things that is attractive about the jumphost
approach is that I can control the patch level of the browser bundle
thereby ensuring that it is up to date and also restrict use of any
other software that could perhaps compromise the integrity of the user's

Yes. I don't really want or need to know what sites they will be
visiting and nightly rebuilds are a major success factor IMO with
regards to this implementation. If I go the Windows route, I'd like put
some restrictions in place in terms of TBB being the only choice of
browser on the machine as well as restrict administrative activity to
Have you or anyone else tried something like this?

Hi All -
Anyone know of a quick way that I can facilitate multiple concurrent Tor
sessions from the same computer all with their own exit IP? I found a
few how-to's using privoxy but this information seems to be a couple of
years old and want to see if there is a more efficient way to accomplish

I have a shared host with as many as five users that will be logged in
at a time, all to use Tor. In the current arrangement if one person is
using Tor then no one else can bind to the local proxy port to forward
their traffic out across the Tor network. The ultimate goal is to be
able to accommodate all of these users at once such that they each have
their own unique identity/exit node IP on the same system. As an added
bit of info, I've placed the current version of the browser bundle in
"C:\" and created a simple batch script that runs at login to copy from
that location to %USERPROFILE%\Desktop so as to maintain unique file
directories for each user. This is a Windows system, FWIW (If you
couldn't tell by the use of the batch script). Any time there is an
update to TBB, I plan to copy to "C:\" and let the script take care of
delivering the updated package to each user as they login.
The links I've seen so far for accomplishing this are:
Would you consider these to be efficient guides for accomplishing this
goal? How would you go about approaching this?
