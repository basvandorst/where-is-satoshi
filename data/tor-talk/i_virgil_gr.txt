I've been unable to determine the units of the exported CSV file.
For example, according to the graph the current total "advertised
bandwidth" is ~10,000 MiB/s.  However, the final line of the CSV has
11,065,082,057 for the "advertised bandwidth".  I've been unable to find a
plausible choice of units that maps 11,065,082,057 -> 10,000.
I tried some guesses for what the units on the 11,065,082,057 could be...
* "Kilobytes per day" yields too small a number---3,001.
* "Megabytes per day" yields too high a number---3,073,634.
I got nothing.  Help for what the units are?

limited by the kinds of sites they can host.  If Tor were faster+more
reliable, many more kinds of sites would be pleasant.  Sites like Hidden
Wiki and TorChan come to mind.
* Streaming video/porn -- I can imagine people in many jurisdictions
wanting to browse sites like pornhub.com from Tor.  However, due to speed,

Cool.  I support that.  For nonnative speakers it might sometimes to

Sure.  The ordinate (y-axis) on Figure 6a is certainly skewed.  I hadn't
articulated it to myself before, but I make an implicit assumption that the
"active" number of clients, over the day, is some fraction of the total
number of clients, and this fraction is constant from day to day.  So
although the absolute numbers would be the different, the shape of the data
would be the same.  Do you dispute this?

both also reasons why I'm not really enthusiastic about the whole thing.
A complementary proposal is to such that each circuit has a most one
incentivized relay, or additionally to forbid an incentivized relay from
being the guard node.  It also seems like a darn-good-idea that people who
run unincentivized nodes get special social recognition.
I used to think of incentivizing Tor relays as a big new idea.  But
increasingly I just see it as an automated way of doing what is already
done.  In the simplest case, say if instead of manually mailing operators a
t-shirt, we had an automated process which gave operators a token that
could be redeemed for a t-shirt, that would be fully sufficient for the
incentivization proposals.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Funded search engine for onionspace? 
- How does the custom google search thing works? Where does it get its
  index? You expose all the tor2web onions on your sitemap, so google
  crawls them and generates an index?
  Correct :)  Everything available on the Google Custom Search is also
available on a regular google search with the qualifier: "site:onion.city"
- I'm a bit concerned that clients connect directly to Google. Can
  this be avoided and still keep the custom google search functionality?
  Alas no.  I'm aware this is suboptimal.  I see GOOG search engine as a
temporary-ladder just to get the ball rolling.  I am open to using any
other index.  For what it's worth I'm very pleased with GOOG's
performance---right now it's searching an index of 650k onion pages and the
number grows every day.
- I don't like that the default link is through onion.city. This means
  that onion.city watches *both* the search query *and* the content of
  the communication. That's crazy.
  In short, yes.  However, you can prevent OnionCity from seeing the search
terms by using "site:onion.city" on GOOG.  I.e.,
- It's especially crazy if you allow your clients to submit HTTP forms
  over onion.city, since it basically means that onion.city gets to
  see *all* the usernames and passwords. I bet there are many people
  out there who don't really get the tor2web threat model, and it's
  nasty to read their passwords.
  Although we technically could read provided passwords, we don't keep logs
of passed traffic.  However, I understand that many users don't understand
the tor2web threat model.  But this is the same as all Tor2web nodes, yes?
This is not at all unique to OnionCity.  As far as I know all Tor2web nodes
allow form submissions.
- There are various ways to solve or semi-solve this problem. My
  preference is to *always* default to the onion link (and maybe also
  have an option for a tor2web alternative). Combined with a nice
  guide on how to download Tor, this might help user education and IMO
  it's the responsible thing to do.
  Currently the guide for downloading Tor is .  Can you suggest something better / more explicit?
  You mentioned it'd be better to have it randomly pick among the available
Tor2web nodes instead of everything going through OnionCity.  This breaks
the GOOG search engine which only wants to return "canonical" URLs.  We
could talk about making OnionCity a DNS round-robin akin to how Tor2web.org
currently works, but then I'm just replicating Tor2web.  We've discussed
OnionCity into Tor2web, but it was discouraged because OnionCity does
aggressive behind-the-scenes caching which made Tor2web uncomfortable.  I
respect Tor2web's collective wishes.
- How do you crawl for more onions?
  Right now I aggregate existing lists of onion sites and put them into the
site map.
  *   *   *   *   As-is GOOG has only indexed only 34% of the domains in the sitemap.  This
can be revisited when GOOG has indexed >90%.
- It really needs HTTPS!
  Agreed 110%.  It's already be there but unfortunately providing HTTPS for
the CDN is currently out of my budget.  This is me inquiring about some of
that MEMEX funding :P
- Are you planning to also index non-HTTP services?
  HTTP and HTTPS.  That's probably it.  Open to others, but then you get
into diminishing returns per-unit-effort.
- Serving onion.city as a hidden service would be nice.
  Open to this idea.  Right now focusing on keeping response times low and
legal hardening.  After that rolling out HTTPS.  After that however a
Hidden Service would be a fine idea.
- Curious on the funding model here. Will there be ads?
  Currently no funding model.  Have considered putting ads on the search
- Thanks and best of luck with your project!
  Looking forward to Tor 0.2.6!  Will be able to provide much more
informative error messages and diagnostics then!  <3

I think the claim is that by default people want to be anonymous, but
also be able to (voluntarily) prove their identity.  If someone wants
to do that, who am I to judge their anonymity goals?  We can argue
that this is too impractical to accomplish, but if it's not a huge
amount of effort, the more diverse the users on Tor the better.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended private key management and recovery 
Hello tor-talk!
I have an operations question for those in high-security orgs:
* How do you manage your private keys?
* How do you do recover from a key-compromise?
I ask because there's talk among Singaporean financial tech firms
about migrating to more transparent (yay!) blockchain-based
cryptoledgers, but a sticking point for management is how to reliably
recover from theft of private keys.  I understand there exist
real-world practices like cold-storage as well as cryptographic
practices like requiring quorum of n keys and then regenerating a
stolen key from the quorum.  However, I am seeking something more
concrete for how it all fits together.  And I figured that if any
group of people both competent and transparent enough to discuss this,
it's tor-talk.
I am currently under the impression that this is a largely-solved
problem, but often requires domain-specific knowledge/techniques.
Ergo, I ask.  A paragraph or two overview of the gist would be fine.
Whatever you write I will probably polish into something non-h4x0rs
can understand.
Thanks much,

The meeting happened. I led with other issues (things we could do for
them), which was declined due too low revenue add. And I wasn't able to get
to the captcha request.
For what it's worth, on a personal level, the management claims to be
decidedly pro-Tor. So if it's not a lot of work to make us happy I see them
supporting it. Given the "everything else being equal, we want to support
Tor" view from management, the issues seem to be:
(1) finding the right person in CloudFlare to field each request. I.e., if
we knew the email address of the person handling the abuse captchas we
could go straight to them and make things easier. This sounds like a job
for someone to go sleuthing on LinkedIn or asking friends at CloudFlare the
right person to ping for each request.
(2) Apparently some parts of CloudFlare's infrastructure (unclear which)
make catering to Tor users difficult. For these, it's unlikely we're likely
to make progress until there's a solid business/PR case for accommodating
Next steps: I would aim for (1) as well as aim getting a few CloudFlare
employees to casually volunteer for Tor things. That will do a lot for
making CloudFlare employees aware of Tor needs.

Just to be concrete, the idea is that if the URL is already cached, to spit
