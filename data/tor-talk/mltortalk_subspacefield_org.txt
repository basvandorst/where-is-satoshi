@_subject: [tor-talk] security properties of tor 
Hey all,
Security researcher here (as I assume are many of you).
Papers and a book linked to from sig.
Anyway, if I want to come up to speed on the security properties
of tor, to the point of understanding how they're enforced and what
isn't an enforced security property, what's the suggested reading?

@_subject: polipo-tor deb/ubuntu native package 
Well, I just saw the vidalia ubuntu packages lately, and I think I'll
make it a recommended package for my polipo-tor package, since vidalia
doesn't seem apropos for headless servers, for example (I could be
wrong; only installed it recently).
I don't; I just installed to parallel files such as /etc/polipo-tor.
In other words, it installs polipo, tor, and a bunch of other
dependencies, and then installs a parallel set of config files,
the installed polipo.  It also runs on a different port (8118 instead
of polipo's default of 8123).
To make it ridiculously easy for people, I created my own repo here:
Just follow the instructions, sudo aptitude install polipo-tor,
install torbutton (or whatever), and go.  Should take all of one
minute to get up and running.
I understand; I'm old school, I used to track all third-party sources
via CVS, but it just doesn't scale very well.  Nowadays if it's not in
a repo, it doesn't exist for most people - it's beyond their
level of interest.  I understand both points of view.
Hmm, I had no idea this was even available for Linux.
It looks like a tarball - it's unclear how this will interact with a
package manager, which likes to know which packages installed which
files, and updates them automatically, etc.
Thanks. ;-)  I believe in do-ocracy.
So, now I've brought the level of effort down to one minute or less,
and the level of thought down to something you can do while drunk and
sleep-deprived, since there's no decisions required.
So how do I make people aware of the option?

@_subject: polipo-tor deb/ubuntu native package 
Makes sense.
I'd like to get it in the torproject.org repo, but I'm not sure how.
Per Andrew's suggestion, I opened a trac.torproject.org ticket to
ask for someone to help me get it in there.
I am unsure of whether it should be in the debian repo, since the
dependencies aren't even in there yet.  However, I could try and
see what they think.
Good point, will do.
I uploaded it to debian-mentors and it checks out fine now (as of
version 1.4)
Is this related, parallel, a superset or a subset of the
debian-mentors RFS process?  I could go through that, but haven't
flagged this package as needing sponsorship yet since the tor
packages themselves aren't in the debian repo.

I'm gonna make this available on a personal repo in the near future
(this weekend or next)... the tools are kinda wonky.
All architectures - no binaries - has a proper list of dependencies I
think, though I should add vidalia and make some of them optional
I've advertised this a few times, to virtually no response.  The
tor-assistants mlist has been confused, with people telling me they
weren't sure what their ubuntu strategy was, whether they even wanted
debian packages, etc.
I haven't, for the life of me, been able to even figure out who to
talk to.  I've posted emails perhaps 3 times, with virtually no
feedback.  Nobody's apparently doing anything.  I don't blame them,
because the debian packaging tools and docs are complicated and
So, I'm just publishing this myself.
If you apt-get this from a repo, it'll install every package you
need, IIUC.
Then install torbutton, one click and you're on tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] anyone in SF want to talk on TOR at BAHA this Sunday, 
We're meeting Sunday at 2pm to give a talk on VPNs and Darknets, and
I'd like to cover TOR too but I could use an expert to assist :-)
Would anyone in the Bay Area like to show up to speak briefly on TOR,
or simply to answer questions?
