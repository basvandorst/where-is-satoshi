@_subject: What's the benefit of a permanent "EntryGuard"? 
From UseEntryGuards 0|1
     If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry servers, and try to stick with them. This is desirable because constantly changing servers increases the odds that an adversary who owns some servers will observe a fraction of your paths. (Defaults to 1.)
I suppose it is only a good idea if the EntryGuards are trusted. I noticed on  that two of my three current EntryGuards are annotated with "Guard", but I don't know what that means, exactly.
You could just set UseEntryGuards to 0.
