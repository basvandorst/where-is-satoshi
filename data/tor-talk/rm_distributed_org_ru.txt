Hi, Daniel!
socks-v4 no # ->> GNU Anubis should talk SOCKS 5
Your ISP's mail server probably denies all connections which are from
outside its own network (and rightly so). And guess where the
Torrified connection to the provider's SMTP server comes from? Right,
from one of the Tor exit nodes, which of course is not within your
provider's smtp server's allowed IP range.
With respect,
 Roman
