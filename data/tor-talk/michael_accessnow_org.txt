Hash: SHA1
Hi folks,
I wanted to put the new 2014 Access Innovation Prize on your radar,
which is a $50,000 award to a FOSS project or a collaboration of
projects that focuses on improving the ?endpoint security? of
individuals and communities working in high-risk environments.
Two of last year's winners -- OONI and flashproxy -- were projects
that are part of the Tor community (full 2012 spread:
 ). I know there are a lot of
great projects incorporating Tor and building it into comprehensive
systems for users, so to the extent that the prize can be an
opportunity to think about usability or security gaps, and pursue or
solidify collaboration with like-minded projects, the better.
The application deadline is January 15th, and if you're interested in
last year's awards and winners for some context, please see
Finalists will be invited to RightsCon: Silicon Valley where the
winner will be announced. If you're interested in submitting proposals
for sessions at RightsCon ( the deadline is
closing at the end of the week (
Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

Yeah with cryptfs I can confirm that the boot/disk encryption password
can be longer than 16.

It sounds like you'd be interested in Parcimonie:
It is a script to refresh your keyring over Tor without disclosing your
entire keyring to the keyserver or others.

Thanks for the further details Rich.
Not sure if others have contacted them yet so Access' helpline staff
reached out to PIR's abuse team about the fake domain -- phishing &
willful distribution of malware are clear violations of PIR anti-abuse
policy. We'll update when we hear anything concrete back.
I don't know if folks will have any luck with the DNS operator & host,
but they are IT Itch ( I think PIR will likely be
more responsive.
