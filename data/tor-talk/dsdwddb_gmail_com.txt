Hi,I want to talk about my one idea of transporting data more secretly on
the internet
Let me call the two node which transporting data each other A and B.
First,the meaning of "secretly" is if A transport data to B ,anyone else
can't get the data which is transported and the man who want to transport
data to B.
on the internet,someone may get the data on the route which is transported
by A ,that's not secret
