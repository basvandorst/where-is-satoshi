Yep, it happens quite frequently to me. I haven't been able to investigate
yet so I don't IM thru tor right now :-(
but remember that if someone wanted to they can steal your creds on their
exit node.

Hi Roger,
The daemon starts up fine and I see connections being made but it just
stops without any indication as to why.
I'm upping the ulimit and will restart the server and see how that goes.

Point taken. I guess I hadn't realized that that many windows users are
running tor clients.
At work we are considering "quizzing" users for certain facts regarding
network operations. Nothing major, just a, "hey, you need to understand
the risks of running p2p software".
Perhaps something in the help of tips section of the tor d/l page, the
apps that the non-technical folks are running, etc.?

It's interesting because the Wiretap Act requires consent before
intercepting the traffic.
This is usually done via AUPs or other policy. I wonder what it means
for people who don't have the opportunity to agree or disagree with
these policies because they don't know about them.

Hi Brent,
At the very least the src ip (although this would be another tor server), src port, dst ip, dst port, protocol (tcp), timestamp.

oh, sure this has been known for a long time. In fact, the CIA will even pay you (much like google adsense) per MB that you allow them to intercept upon exit.
At $0.20USD/MB I was able to supplement my regular income. Soon I'll be able to quit my regular job. It's like all of those emails say, let your computer work for you!

Um, sorry... any references made to actually receiving money from a government organization for capturing traffic were meant as a joke.

@_subject: Abuse ticket 
Not to turn this into a legal thread (compulsary IANAL warning) but I
don't see how running a tor exit node makes anyone a common carrier.
I would be very interested to see any legal precedence for this. If anything most exit nodes reside in network space that has it's own
set of acceptable use policies (most of which are vague enough to ban
servers or extend the network beyond what the ISP has provisioned to the
In order to be considered a "common carrier" I believe that you need to
have the authority to provide service, which in most AUPs is not granted
and usually strictly forbidden.
Because a ISP doesn't actively enforce all aspects of a AUP doesn't mean
that it doesn't have a legal right to do so when it finds a customer
violating the AUP (this is why they are so vaguely written).
My $0.02, and again IANAL.
Perhaps it's better to follow the craigslist route and force https when
a user wants to post something. This way a tor node could block https to
the network space craigslist uses. This would allow a user to browse but
not post via a tor exit node.

@_subject: Restricted Exit Policy Port Suggestions? 
In my opinion, more often then not DMCA takedown requests center around
file-sharing and also more often then not the takedown requests actually
have validity to them.
There are certainly instances where takedown requests are incorrect but
the frequency of them isn't high (again, my opinion).
My $0.02, after having processed many a takedown request.
If you want to exclude p2p, then I would bet that the amount of abuse
reports would plummet.

Hi Roger,
Thanks for the detailed explanation. It's always interesting to hear about how other go into the "verification route" when a compromise happens.
Do you know the nature of the compromise? Was it against Tor itself or one of the other services running on the Directory Authorities?
Just curious, as it sounds like each of the DA was running a different set of apps, but perhaps I read more into that then was said.
Also, is there a need for hardware to be apart to physically partition services (i.e. svn,git,dns)? Or do you guys already have that covered?
