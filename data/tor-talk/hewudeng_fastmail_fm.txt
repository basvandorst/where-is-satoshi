I am running xBBrowser 2.0.0.15a and want to set entry and exit and other things in the torrc. Where do I place the torrc file in xBBrowser? I am also curious about the add-ons "xB Browser Customization". No description to find for it.

Thank you. I have the Torbrowser but it did not work on my XP machine. Today I download the new and going to test. The Xerobank forum is impossible to register. I tried 3 times and always the error of no avathar but there is no avathar to choose. Not even with images enabled. To click a row in the list is obviously not enough to get an avathar. If the author see this, please regiser me. The email used is the same as here.

Always the same. Now with the new Torbrowser 1.1.2. I extract the files into a folder, draw a shortcut to desktop from the 'Start Tor Browser.exe' and click up the 'Vidalia Control Panel' and allow everything the firewall ask, ZoneAlarm. Then nothing happen for ever. When I click it away, it freeze and I have to end it all in Ctrl-Alt-Del Processes. Now running xBBrowser again, this always work but I want the Torbrowser to run.

Sorry, I do not understand the answer. My last message is answer to the 'Andrew' question what problem I have with Torbrowser, see below. I can add that I have Windows XP, AMD Athlon, 1.6 GHz, 256 MB RAM and some gigs free HDD. On Thu, 14 Aug 2008 19:28:43 -0400, phobos at rootme.org said:
