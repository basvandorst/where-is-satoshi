@_subject: how to see if directory is sent 
hi, i am running a server with 30kb rate and burst and both orport and
dirport open. from time to time there is the message "directory_handle_command_get(): Client asked for the mirrored
directory, but we've been writing too many bytes lately. Sending 503
Dir busy."
in server info log. I would like to see how many times the directory is successfully sent.
What is the message for that that in the info log or how otherwise i
can see that ? because if most of the time there is no bandwidth left for
directory-traffic, i could(should?) turn dirport off.

@_subject: LOTS of messages: "package_window 0. Skipping" 
Hi, I see some hundrets messages, each every few seconds:
[info] connection_edge_package_raw_inbuf(): called with package_window
0. Skipping.
Is that DoS attack or what's up ?

hm, i have log level info, because it's just so amazing for me to see
tor working, it's such a fine thing.
But ok, I try to not bother You with questions about info messages
anymore :)

@_subject: what data transmission with tor is a security risk ? 
- plain text pop3
- telnet
Is it save to surf with tor and enter login username and passwort for
the website, if the form is in https ? If it's not https, is it unsafe?
What other types of data transmission of login/passwort
combination is sniffable ? (i know, every unencrypted, please
give tricky examples, if there are)
I think with .htaccess authentication the passwort is transmitted
encrypted? But if the Password is weak, the sniffer can easily do an
brute force attack at home...

I think that, too. There should be a big fat warning.

@_subject: uptime of tor servers with dynamic ip after every ip change zero 
is it right that the uptime of tor server gets zero when it's ip
changes? That would have some logic, true. But on the other way such a
tor server itself maybe runs some weeks without interruption, though.
Is that considered when assuming a tor servers availability in the tor
network? Maybe it would not be so good, when a tor server starts at
zero availability assumption every 24h because of ip change?
