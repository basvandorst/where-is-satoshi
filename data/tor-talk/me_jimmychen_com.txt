There are malicious TOR Nodes, and you can't stop that from happening. But
it is up to the service providers to enable encryption on their servers,
removing the possibility that such data can be intercepted. You shouldn't
trust your information to be sent through a plaintext protocol to begin
with, and any provider that doesn't offer a SSL-enabled service (either
required or optional), probably isn't worth your time when using TOR
Even if TOR did certify exit nodes, who would be in charge of
certification? What if someone wanted to be anonymous during such process?
How many exits and relays would be backlogged, and what could we do to
solve a shortage of TOR Nodes? What's stopping someone from making a
legitimate TOR exit, getting it certified and then turning malicious when
the process is done? Wouldn't a thorough certification just discourage
people from running such nodes?
Heck, what would happen when a certification is violated? Would I get
$10,000 like with the SSL certificates being issued?
Nothing's stopping you from selecting a TOR Node you trust either, it's
just a line of parameter.
If you want your exit nodes to be certified, it's probably best at this
time, to use JAP instead of TOR.

I never said properly and ethically certified, did I.

Technically, the most effective way of avoiding TOR Exit nodes snooping in
on you is not using TOR in the first place. This is a genuine answer, I'm
not being sarcastic.
But you open yourself up to communications sniffing, wiretaps, mass
surveillance and other NSA operations vs the option of 2% of the TOR
Network who are intentionally and maliciously evil in their ideals.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Secure email with limited usable metadata 
This poses a really interesting question.
Another solution would be to use already existing remailers, and doubling
the encryption together with the TO: email in the inline plaintext. The
question is how to properly do a dual encryption.
My proposed solution is the following:
Plaintext message (encrypted for recipient, with unencrypted portion
dictating the recipient through inline text) -> Encrypted Message
(encrypted again to remailer's PGP, including inline portion) -> Remailer
(decrypted intended layer. Message is sent to recipient dictated in the
inline text) -> Recipient's Email Server / Provider (cannot be read by
provider) -> Recipient Mailbox
