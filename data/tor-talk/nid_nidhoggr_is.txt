Sasse und Partner are using a company called Guardeley Ltd to trawl BT
traffic and send out scores of extortion letters. The technical accuracy

There are advisories pertaining to Sasse und Partner available from
several Verbraucherzentralen (Consumer Protection Association) as well as
countless legal firms. Just fire up your preferred search engine.
IANAL but would suggest not bringing your Tor exit note into this matter
voluntarily. There are plenty of solicitors available with experience
dealing with Sasse und Partner, if yours isn't you might want to look
around. Most offer a free initial consultation so you cannot really loose
anything but a few minutes of your time
