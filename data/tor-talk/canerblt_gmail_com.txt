Yes. How you do this depends on what platform you're on, but generally
your goal is to get an NTP (network time protocol) client going.
"In general, the complete connection between client and hidden service
consists of 6 relays: 3 of them were picked by the client with the
third being the rendezvous point and the other 3 were picked by the
hidden service."
