@_subject: How to "wrap" applications in Mac OS X? 
Is there a "torify" equivalent for Mac OS X, or does Torify work on that platform... And if so, can it wrap GUI applications as well? Asking because I'd like certain applications on my system without individual proxy settings to use Tor, and certain apps of the same class not to...

Well, assuming that it is only a technically-minded userbase that installs Tor, then maybe! Do you guys have any sense of whether or not that's actually true?

This is not an entrepreneurial proposition all. I'm merely talking about exposing the end-users to the financial realities of operating the service, and inviting them to help in a more obvious way. I'm NOT suggesting blatant nagware. "Gentle" is the word used, and I certainly never said pop-ups.
Forget my comment about technically-minded users for a moment. My question really should read: "Are there a significant body of end users of Tor who do not understand how it fundamentally works?"
Think about it: Once Tor is setup properly, how often is the average user going to return to the website to be reminded that they should donate, or that Tor organizationally is in need of this or that? Yes, the speed of the network should be some indicator, but I am suggesting that not everyone will know that, so perhaps a message like "Tor exit nodes are heavily congested. Click here to help . . . " would have a beneficial impact.
All this being said, I completely understand, even even fully empathize with your reaction. I would never want to see Tor be packaged with crapware!

@_subject: How to "wrap" applications in Mac OS X? 
Responding to part of what you said in the Exit Node Sponsorship thread, this makes me think that something which could be really useful -- and which could certainly lessen the newbie-not-effectively-using-Tor-syndrome: a sort-of launcher and "dashboard" for apps that are to be "Torified" (using torsocks, dsocks, or whatever else). In other words, a panel that they open up, drag apps into, and -- if they are launched from this panel -- get properly wrapped. A simple, green light / red light metaphor could then be used to indicate whether or not they are being run through Tor.
Is that conceivable?
I imagine that from there they could also get warnings if the app is leaking DNS requests and so on (couched of course in simpler terms, 'warning: although Tor is trying to protect you, this application is giving away your private information. Click here to see a recommended replacement')... Leading to a web tool which recommends replacements for 'unsafe' apps.
I can try mocking all of this up if it would be helpful. I imagine that no one would have time to implement it for a while, but if Tor use is starting to become more mainstream the conceptual direction could perhaps be at least mildly useful?

Wow Runa, while I unfortunately can't help with any translations, I just want to say that that app looks wonderful and wish you the best of luck with it. Wish I had something like that on my iPhone!

Does Tor do any kind of traffic shaping?

In this case, purposely 'shaping' the traffic so that it looks like something other than what it actually is (ie, not Tor traffic).

Fantastic Marco!
A few questions:
1) The iPhone, especially the basic 3G model, seem pretty strapped for free resources (RAM and CPU cycles)... How does Tor fare with those limitations? How much RAM does it really need anyway?
2) Is Privoxy/Polipo needed for iPhone apps?
3) How does the Tor background process affect battery life?

Have you guys thought organizing a (very) public Kickstarter.com project for the purpose of raising the funds and creating awareness of need?

============================== START ==============================
Back to the Kickstarter idea, while I fully understand and agree with most of your points, my thought was one of publicly creating awareness of need. Whatever the appropriate platform, I really think it needs to move in that direction.
Let's hypothesize for a moment that a suitable basic payment platform is found. What if Tor, the application itself (not making a distinction between Tor and Vidalia here), were to make people more aware of the need for exit node donations? I'm not necessarily suggesting nagware pop-ups, but I am talking about something like, perhaps, a splash screen with a reminder -- and a button -- upon launch. I am also talking about gentle nudges in the initial setup process. "Tor development is only possible with your support!" etc etc.
And the Tor Browser Bundle? How about making its default page an explanation of the need for more exit notes, statistics, and some kind of visualization of what the impact would be for a given amount donated?
And make it beautiful and simple, like this: To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with
