Hello Marcus,
Thank you very much for that explanation.? Maybe it would be a good idea to make better mention of it on the TBB homepage (  )?
All the best
What you are experiencing happens from time to time and is completely
normal. If the IP you are showing on the TorCheck page isn't your own,
then you're probably ok.
The reason that this happens is that there is a desync between when your
node learns about freshly started exits and when various tools update
their caches. Your node may pickup and use a new exit node that has not
yet been grabbed into the cache backing the TorCheck page. This also
applies for the TorStatus listing over at kgprog.
These generally work off cached copies of authority statuses, not
authorities themselves.
In this way, the TorCheck page is biased toward false positives than
false negatives, which is the preference. It would be much worse to let
someone who needs to use the network to think they were anonymized when
they really weren't than it would be to tell someone who was properly
anonymized that they may not be using the network.
Also, I just checked the IP address that you listed above. It is now
listed as an exit in the TorStatus page, but with an uptime of less than
a day. Hence, it fits well into this scenario.
You can always check to see if the node is listed in your
~$ grep 67.166.145.75 /var/lib/tor/cached-descriptors
router AlladinSane 67.166.145.75 443 0 9030
reject 67.166.145.75:*
A quick heuristic looking at this notes that it rejects exits to itself.
As this is part of the default exit policy, you can reasonably assume
this node is set up to be an exit.

Hi Andrew,
I believe a few minutes before I sent that email.  The 3rd false-positive happened at about 5:30-5:40pm.
Your assumption is not correct but that's my fault.  When I wrote the "TBB homepage" I meant (  ).  When I wrote "TorCheck" I meant (  ).  They both gave me the same false-positive on all three occasions.
I normally would not be concerned and after the first false-positive I thought it was a snafu, but I knew I was using the Tor network as shown by using NEWNYM and re-testing at those two sites.  However, on the 2nd occasion I started to think something was wrong or some bug was rearing it's head...and by the 3rd occasion (which happened shortly after the second) I started to get a little worried.
I am fairly well versed in Tor and how to use it correctly, but even I was thrown off by the repeated false-positives.  I wonder how people new to Tor would react?  Maybe adding a 'better' blurb about the false-positives on the exit node check site run by Tor Project would be a good idea (  ) ?
Thank you

@_subject: SoC Project: Improving Hidden Service Security and Usability 
Hi Ringo,
Thanks for your soon to be improvements!?? I have a couple of requests/questions if you do not mind:
1. I believe the current state of Hidden Service (HS) is one where access to an HS can be username:passphrase protected?? Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe someone made HS security/usability improvements a while ago which included the username:passphrase option and making it possible to keep the URL hidden from anyone except those who are provided the URL?? (ie. 'Toogle' (sp?) (Tor-google) will not 'find' the HS URL if the administrator of the HS chooses to keep the URL private).
If the above is correct could you please make it possible, or describe how an administrator could setup the HS access page (ie username:passphrase)? to accept a PGP key in place of username:passphrase?? Or maybe a username:PGP key to access the HS?
2. Could you please setup or describe how to use a CAPTCHA in the form of a 'word of the day'?? For example, the police have a "color of the day", a colored band they where when in plain cloths.? This color changes everyday.? If they are in question to clothed police they can show the color of the day to prove they really are police.? In this fashion an administor could setup a 'word (or phrase) of the day' (or week, etc).? The administor could contact the members via TorPM (for example) to tell them the new 'word of the day'.? Thus an adversay would need a legitamte members private PGP key AND the 'word of the day' to access the HS.
3. Could you please make it possible or describe how to setup forums in a secure fashion?? I like the idea of "Onion Forum" but I have no idea if it's setup in a secure fashion or not.? 4. Other services which an administrator could offer would be great.? Maybe a blog?? However, to me the use a forums in OnionLand is most interesting and useful; for example a section of the forums could be a quasi-blog.
5. I have always been interested in the idea of a colo-HS.? Could you please describe how one could be setup?? And could you please detail the associated risks vs benefits?? I have in my minds eye that running a colo-HS is not a good...
6. I know this might be asking too much but info/scripts to setup FDE (Full Disk Encryption) would be great!? I know the old 'how-to' for running a node on *nix included info on setting up FDE but the directions are/were very clunky and hard to follow. Thanks!? (and sorry if some of those are stupid requets)

I have been mounting a little movement to get people to run Tor and setup Tor Bridges to help those in Iran access the Internet.?

Would it be wise to ask people in or-talk to provide Bridge addresses to this topic? ?

Hi Roger,
I have no idea if Tor relays are working from Iran or not.  On CNN they have been reporting that a vast amount of proxies are provided each day
to the dissidents.  Supposedly that is how they are sending the pics and video we see each day.  To me it sounds like plain ol' one hop open proxies,
not Tor.  I have emailed CNN asking how one can provide proxies and to which
organization, they have yet to email me back.
Even if it is the former I like the tone of your sentence!  I am looking
forward to seeing what your guys/gals come up with :) I will email CNN and ask them, but they are getting SO much email I
have doubts they will get back to me.  Does Tor Project not have contacts
in Iran?  I wonder how/if we can find out specifically how the Iran Government is blocking Internet access?
If a representative from the EFF or Tor contacted CNN I bet they would Yea I was wondering about that.  Who to trust?...

To everyone:
Thanks so much for the interest!? I was just watching CNN and they have been reporting from Channel One (  ) in LA.? It's the largest and most viewed 'outside' Farsi news channel in Iran.? They are still broadcasting and the owner is an exile from Iran; he is trying to promote Democracy in Iran.? People of Iran can still watch Channel One through Afghan TV; or if the Iranians kept their satellite dishes (the Revolutionary Guard has been taking them) they can watch Channel One because the news station changed it's broadcast frequency.
Channel One has sent 10,000 video cameras in the form of a pen, a "camera pen".? It has audio and records for 20 minutes.? But the neat part is you open it up and you find it's really a USB/camera pen.? I assume it must run on Windows.? Channel One is planning on sending *thousands* more of these pen cameras to Iran this week.
I then thought of contacting Channel One and telling them about Tor, TorBrowserBundle and Tor Bridges.? Why not have them put TBB on *each* pen they send out?? And with each TBB they could include the signature and a .txt file with a few Tor Bridges listed.? Ideally each pen could have a different list of Tor Bridges.? Alought as amir (hushang) aziziIs wrote, Tor is working from Iran at this time.? Is Vidalia trasnled into Farsi?
I will contect Channel One in three hours.? I hope I can get some respones and direction (if I am misguieded) before then.? If the Tor Project or the EFF wanted to be the entity who contacts Channel One be my guest.? All the best and Demoracy for all!

Then I found a great message which has been going around asking people to run Tor Bridges.? So I thought: "what about or-talk?".?

Excellent info, thanks.
Great.  I will inform others who want to help but do not know how.
Do you know if he reads this list?  Have you contacted him about Tor?  The Revolutionary Guard has stated they will crack down on anyone disseminating images out of Iran.  I fear they could be running honey pots in the form of simple squid proxies and such.  So austinheap just trusts each provider of squid proxies at face value?  That seems very dangerous...

Yea, good ol' Pandora ;)
CNN had the same concerns.  They asked Channel One if broadcasting the pen images and info was wise.  The reporter asked if Channel One was putting Iranians in danger because the authorities and militia would now look for those pens.  Channel One responded by saying the pens have been in use for a while, I guess that means the past week or so.  I have doubts about the abilities and sophistication of the Iranian Internet censors.  They haven't blocked Tor or apparently Freegate, and I'm sure that means I2P2 gateways are also working...
Great!  If you would like to contact them I think that would be best.  I'm just
some guy, but you are not.  You know so much more than I do and it seems your grammar is better too :)  An official contact from a member of the Tor Project would be a great choice, I'm sure Channel One will respond.
Do you know if Pidgen translated into Farsi?
I was thinking about asking them to translate the Bridges[1] and TBB install page[2] into Farsi.  They could translate the text easy enough I assume.  An added bonus would
be if they translated the Tor Overview page[3].

Hi Roger and Karsten,
The problem with Tor and Tor Bridges is so few people know about it.? And to get a Tor bridge one must understand Gmail usage, etc.? All when English is probably not the first language.? I agree that collecting and sending Bridge address or Squid proxy address is not the ideal method but in my opinion it is better than nothing (assuming the Tor network get blocked).
What are the options?? Tor needs to be easier for people to find and use Bridge addresses.? I have helped 6 people setup Tor and Tor Bridges in the last week so they can help the Iranians.? And every person was brand new to Tor and each one complained about how hard it was to setup and run (they all use Windows XP).? Two people tried and gave up.
The hardest issues seems to be telling people about Bridges and how to find them.? If one is using Tor and doesn't know about Bridges and all of the sudden Tor is blocked I don't think the person would find Bridges or understand their use without a lot of effort (most people have little understanding of most GUIs, let alone command line, etc).
I would love to see Tor get more attention, even though you (Roger) would not.? I assume you are correct but it just seems so many people who could use and greatly benefit from Tor are not because they don't know about it....
I for one would like to email the Internet anchor Josh Levs from CNN.? I would like to tell him about Tor and help him understand it.? Then he can report on how people in Iran can use Tor and how people outside Iran can email Tor to people within Iran in case the Tor website goes down.? Would be mind if I did so?? I would not discuss Bridges.
I sees both sides of the issue but to me it's most important to let people know about Tor and Tor Bridges.? I assume it's only a short time until Iran blocks anonymity networks.? I am very surprised they have not done so yet...
You and Karsten know much more than I do so I defer to you.? But I do think it's very important to let people know how they can use Tor to help in this crisis.
There are only a few hundred running bridges right now. I think it's fine
to "use" them all this week, if people want to. We'll have more later,
and it'll be good to learn some lessons here.
You can discover some bridge addresses either with a gmail account,
or with a web browser:
It seems that other people are collecting bridge addresses manually and
giving them out when they find people who could use one. This might
be a bad idea, in that it increases the risk that the attacker will
get ahold of the bridge address, since now there are two ways to learn
it. But it also might be a good idea, since now it's more likely to get
used by somebody who needs it (not everybody knows about the above two
URLs after all).
I'm not sure what the right balance is.
In any case, the Tor network itself hasn't been blocked in Iran, as far
as I can tell. So in a sense this bridge stuff (the next step in the
arms race) is all just practice.

Hello Robert and Karsten N.,
Both you of have expressed concerns about politicizing Tor and I agree
to an extent.? If we don't tell those who need Tor about Tor why make
Tor in the first place?
I am not helping the Iranians because I like them or that I like Democracy.? I am helping them because the need help accessing the Internet, simple as that.? I don't know enough about the issues in Iran to make a decision on anything, I am only trying to spread anonymity and help those who want it.? Likewise I would help any group or person who seeks anonymity and is not violent, or trying to repress other people, period.?? My only 'issue' is human rights and to? me politics plays no roll in that.? Human rights are not the concern of any one group or Nation, it should be the concern of every Homo sapien.? Hell, I'd help a alien if they asked for it and did expose a wish to kill other aliens...
It think those who use Tor and the Tor Project media team should try to help all those who need and ask for help *and* do not expose a wish to kill or oppress.? IMO the "whys'" of killing and oppression are not important, what is important is they should not happen, period.
To me that is a different issue than running a Bridge.? If I am running a entry/rely/exit node then sure, I feel the same.? I don't want kiddy porn to be transferred over my node but I'm not about to throw the baby out with the bath water.?? However, when I am running a Bridge node I feel it's my right as the operator to choose who I give it to.? I won't give it to those who expose the wish to view kiddy porn but I will give it to those who expose the wish for freedom of speach...
