Is there a reason for doing this over a hidden service instead of just

As far as I'm aware, the reason for this is that the BitTorrent protocol
is designed to share the user's IP with others in the swarm. Since Tor
doesn't map each connection to a unique circuit, the de-anonymized
BitTorrent connection could be used to identify other connections on the
same circuit. The attack had nothing to do with large files.

If Google was reading your email, you could not track them down or hold
them responsible. Google, like other corporations, is not restricted by
law. What you're referring to is "privacy by policy." In this mode of
thinking, you assert that a service is private because the person
providing that service says that it's private. At this point, you need
go figure out how much you trust them to evaluate how private that
system is. Tor and other privacy-enhancing technologies provide "privacy by
design." In this mode of thinking, you assert that a service is private
because you, the person using it, uses some other technology that
enforces privacy. At this point, you don't care about who's running the
service, because even though Google has a lot of lawyers, those lawyers
can't get a court order to break RSA. The government can't subpoena

If the attack is actually SlowLoris, then no. SlowLoris makes Apache use
lots of resources, but it does so using very little network traffic. The
Tor nodes involved would just transfer the small amount needed for
Apache to keep the connection open and move on.
It seems like SlowLoris is the only attack you could really do on a Tor

How would you do that without facing the same problem as someone
wiretapping their own exit node? Do you have a CP classifier? Are you
going to load each .onion and manually verify if it contains CP? How are
you going to aggregate that into statistics?
I don't have to "bring my own references" to point out that the only
*actually existing* "statistical" evaluation of illegal content on Tor,
that provides the cornerstone of your argument that "The Tor Project is
misleading the public about the use cases of Tor," is totally baseless.
You have no explanation for how that person reached that conclusion.
I am posting because I think your attitude that Tor is entirely used for
CP and other illegal content is baseless. It's based on a flawed

Well, you're assuming that an exit node (with some given exit policy)
sees a fair sampling of all Tor exit traffic. This is not the case. Look
into how Tor assigns exit nodes.
The non-trivial thing being added to the discussion is that your

and apparently from others.

The obvious problem with this (((this, right here, is the productive
contribution to discussion this email has: it points out the problem
with your proposed methodologies))) is that it presumes that these top
50 .onion domains comprise the majority of .onion traffic through your
node. I suspect this is not the case. If I'm right, and most of the .onion traffic through any given node is
over the "long tail", it won't be possible to get anything useful
without an automated classifier.
Further, this depends on a long list of assumptions (that all .onion
sites are serving HTTP over port 80, that the HTTP sites use an
authentication system you can detect as such, etc.).
You have equally few references. I can duplicate your references
whenever I choose to make a Reddit account and claim to have seen only
legal content over Tor.
You don't seem to be using any actual, quantified method to arrive at
these conclusions. As such, you're probably using your own biased human

anecdotes you've shared are a fraction of the anecdotes you've actually
seen, filtered through the very many cognitive biases we suffer from as
The hypothesis you assign the highest probability towards causing these
anecdotes is "Tor is mostly used for criminal activity." There are a
wide variety of other hypotheses that seem to me to be equally likely to
produce these anecdotes, such as "the link network of .onion sites that
you are privy to contain mostly criminal sites," "criminals are more
public about their intentions than other users of Tor," and "you have
seen more criminals post about their activities because of your
person-specific interests."
What exit policy did she use? What percentage of Tor exit traffic did

I ran this script on the current consensus. The full results (the
nodes-sniff-summary file) are below my signature. How did you compile
the country-codes to IPs list? That wasn't produced by the script.
It's comforting that this approach yields quickly diminishing returns.
Going from 25 to 60 networks only gets you a 10% increase in networks
surveillance (if I'm reading the output correctly), and returns plateau
entirely at that point (I'm considering about two percent to be in the
noise, which may not be appropriate to this domain).
Also, it's not immediately clear whether eavesdropping those networks
would actually get you strong enough correlation to accurately
de-anonymize users[1]. If our rodent(?) friend(s?) could comment on
this, I'd appreciate their expertise.
I also think that if it were possible for "unsophisticated law
enforcement" to deanonymize Tor users, they would already do it. If I
remember correctly, the Tor project gets a lot of requests from law
enforcement to deanonymize Tor users for them, which indicates that they
can't do it themselves (Andrew Lewman would be able to say if I'm
correct or not). I've also never heard of a conviction obtained through the use of this
material, though sophisticated TLAs might not much care. I wonder what a
search through the email dumps leaked by Anonymous in the past year for
Tor would yield. If this attack were possible in the wild, I'd expect

Ladies and gentlemen, I am a Raccoon who has learned to do math.
It used to be the case that on the Internet, nobody knew you were a
Raccoon. But now that Privacy is dead, I've decided to come clean.
I present to you this anonymously authored, non-peer reviewed
communication to do with what you will. Should anyone actually cite
this work in a published paper, I will ask my brethren to leave their
garbage cans unmolested for the rest of their days.
This post performs some basic analysis of the utility of timing
correlation attacks against a moderately used anonymous network,
specifically with respect to the Base Rate Fallacy[1] of Bayesian
statistics. Via that same analysis, it also for the first time begins to
quantify the utility that additional users bring to a low latency
anonymous network in terms of resistance to timing attacks.
You see, one day I was rifling through the local University dumpster
looking for a free meal, and I stumbled upon a pile of discarded
conference proceedings which I decided to peruse while I dined. After
a while, it became apparent that many papers dealing with timing and
correlation attacks completely ignore the Base Rate Fallacy and the
effect of larger user bases and sample sizes on their results.
Worse, while it may be possible that some papers actually DO report
Bayesian Detection Rate probabilities, those that do never specify
this fact, making their work impossible to differentiate from less
appetizing dumpster morsels.
It was enough to get this Raccoon down, and I survive contently on
moldy bread and discarded hot dogs[2]!
Event Notation and Grounding
Most timing attack papers deal with the true positive rate and the
false positive rate of detection. So let's establish some symbols
and formalize these two rates.
M = Two chosen entry and exit streams Match (are the same stream)
~M = Two chosen entry and exit streams Don't Match (are not the same)
C = Packet/stream timing Correlation predicts a pair is matching
~C = Packet/stream timing Correlation predicts a pair is Non-matching
True Positive Rate: P(C|M)
False Negative Rate: P(~C|M) = 1-P(C|M)
True Negative Rate: P(~C|~M) = 1-P(C|~M)
False Positive Rate: P(C|~M)
Bayesian Detection Rate Derivation
Given a purely hypothetical network with 250,000 concurrent users
generating approximately 5000 network-wide concurrent streams and a
99.9% accurate (Equal Error Rate) generic correlation detector, find
the probability that we actually DO have a matching entry+exit pair
given our Correlator says that we do. This is known as the Bayesian
Detection Rate, and is written as P(M|C).
From Bayes:
P(M|C) = P(C|M)*P(M)/P(C)
Summing out M to obtain P(C):
P(C) = P(M)*P(C|M) + P(~M)*P(C|~M)
P(M|C) = P(C|M)*P(M)/(P(M)*P(C|M) + P(~M)*P(C|~M))
Example 1: Fully Correlating Global Adversary
This example deals with an adversary trying to correlate EVERYTHING on
a 5000 concurrent stream network at all times. 5000 concurrent streams
means 5000 entry connections and 5000 exit connections (as an
approximation). This gives 5000^2 possible entry-exit pairings
network-wide, thus:
P(M) = (1/5000)^2 = 4E-8
99.9% EER generic correlation detector:
P(C|M) = 0.999
P(C|~M) = 0.001
P(M|C) = 0.999*4E-8/(4E-8*0.999 + (1-4E-8)*0.001)
P(M|C) = .00004 or .004%.
In other words, we expect that for every 25000 times the correlator
predicts a matching pair, only one of those actually is a valid
match. So much for dragnet surveillance.
Example 2: Single Site-targeting Global Adversary
In this example, the adversary is only interested in connections to a
particular site, say wikileaks.org. For this, let's say the adversary
only has one exit stream at a given time to correlate to a given entry
stream, giving:
P(M) = 1/5000 = .0002
P(M|C) = 0.999*.0002/(.0002*0.999 + (1-.0002)*0.001)
P(M|C) = .1666 = 16.66%
So this means that we expect the adversary to have 6 suspect users for
every user that leaks a document to wikileaks.org for a 99.9% accurate
correlator. Unlike the dragnet adversary, the targeted adversary is
pretty effective, especially since they will almost certainly have
a-priori information about the users they suspect to have done the leak.
However, if their correlator drops to just 99% EER, however, P(M|C)
to 0.0194 or 1.94%. At 90% EER, P(M|C) is 0.0018 or 0.18%. These
provide with expectations of confusion sets of 52 and 556 users
Example 3: Single Site-targeting "Local" Adversary
To extend this into the capabilities of a local adversary (as opposed
to global), insert a (c/n)^2 factor into P(M) to account for the
that the adversary will see both sides of a connection, where c is the
percentage of network bandwidth they control, and n is the total network
capacity. Common accepted reasonable values for c/n are on the order
of 0.1, though this may be much higher for IX-level yet not quite fully
global adversaries[3]. Let's go with 0.3.
P(M) = (1/5000)*(0.3)^2 = .000018
P(M|C) = 0.999*.000018/(.000018*0.999 + (1-.000018)*.001)
P(M|C) = 0.0177 = 1.77%
So this means that an adversary with control of 30% of the network
(such as China, the US, or Germany) can expect to go through 57 other
users before coming across a legitimate match predicted by their
timing detector. At 99% EER, this number goes up to 562, and at 90%
EER, all the way up to 6173.
This seems a bit more infeasible, but may still be doable with enough
information or many repeated observations.
So what does this all mean? Well, first of all, it underscores the
importance of being absolutely clear in timing attack research about
exactly what success probabilities are being reported, so we can
better compare both attacks and defenses. In fact, in the opinion of
this humble Raccoon, a large body of work is somewhat suspect for
lack of clarity, both in this and other respects.
Second, it gives us a small glimmer of hope that maybe all is not lost
against IX, National, or ISP level adversaries. Especially those with
only sampled or connection-level resolution, where fine-grained
details on inter-packet timings is not available (as will likely be
the case with EU data retention).
Finally, it also quantifies that we certainly do benefit from a larger
anonymity network not just in terms of nodes, but also in terms of
total concurrent users doing similar things (like short-lived web
traffic). This quantification strongly indicates that we should avoid
splitting the network into segments if we want to gain any additional
utility from growing it further, aside from simply supporting more
users at some fixed level of anonymity.

-------- Forwarded Message --------
Tor-talk unsubbed me yesterday, probably for publishing on Cryptome
Eugen's forward of this thread's initial message from Roger Dingledine,
with our additional pointers to enduring USG funding of the Tor Project.
That Tor Project has enlisted many dedicated participants around the
world is most admirable. If it was not so jingoistic and US-promotional
it would be a crowd-source service deserving of trustworthiness.
Its long-time funding by the USG propanda agency, the Broadcast Board
of Govenors, as well as several front organizations, is not to be overlooked
by incessant braggardy, technical conceit and thin-skinnedness by its
spokespersons, primarily majordomos Andrew Newman and Jacob
Appelbaum, now joined by sub-lieutenants to admit not serious faults
in the system. (The inventors and most capable technologists of Tor
do not exaggerate its virtues.)
Tor Project's duplicity reminds of ICANN and a slew of other USG TLA to maintain control of the Internet while espousing a US-centric version
of information freedom which actually serves as a component of the
US national security regime.
State Department brags of the thousands of info fighters it is subsidizing,
and NSA is openly recruiting hackers. It should be assumed that the TLAs
have co-opted Anonymous-like initiatives in concert with pernicious
sockpuppetry in social media.
Tor Project would benefit from escaping USG financial clutches, albeit
difficult if dependency has become inured. The proposal to expand USG
funding for exit relays -- its most vulnerable and compromisable aspect --
is a gift horse needing a dental check before buying in.

Your use of the words "rumored" and "mythical" are exactly why I don't
think a global passive adversary should be in an educational graphic for
people who don't know what Tor is. A global passive adversary seems very
unlikely now, and it seems even more unlikely that such an adversary
would be able to act on intelligence gained from being in that
position. It is true that Tor is weak against a global passive adversary, but
there's no reason, from my point of view, to include that in material

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-relays]  clockskewer attack 
This particular script that is currently being hyped up on Reddit as
"de-anonymizing most Tor hidden servers" simply makes too many
assumptions to be feasible.
Yes, this sort of attack is feasible in principle, and this script will
probably work if you find a hidden service that is also a relay and is
also a publicly reachable HTTP server, but saying it can be carried out
against most hidden services is simply false as a matter of fact.
Hidden services don't need to be reachable from the Internet. They don't
need to have accurate clocks. And as a result, a lot of them aren't
vulnerable to a program on the Internet that is being marketed as
reliably de-anonymizing hidden services.
To summarize:
      * This is not a novel attack
      * This particular variant of the attack ("clockskewer") is not
        effective against many if not most hidden services
      * The people claiming it does on Reddit are scare-mongering Tor
        for karma, and that irritates me as someone who likes Tor and
        wants people who need more-secure systems to research Tor and
        see the stable, well-tested tool that it is, rather than hype
        from Reddit.

Have you tried 'torsocks '?
Tor doesn't really make sense as a static library, or a library at all.
If you want to get proxied sockets, use any SOCKS library and point it
at Tor.
Tor (running only as an Onion Proxy or "client") has a large amount of
application-neutral state -- would every 'favorite little binary' set up
a separate set of circuits pre-emptively?
If you can sit down with the Tor source code and come up with a
compelling narrative for a Tor library that isn't just a SOCKS library,
I'd be interested in reading it, but I just don't see how the current
Tor design/implementation is in any way amenable to this.

This seems similar to when Australia outlawed porn involving women with

Nobody is trying to support actual images of child abuse as far as I can

There are just some who think that anything that can be logically
connected to child abuse should be illegal (like school uniforms, or
small breasts), and some who think that only images that involve actual
human children should be illegal.
This also seems similar to when the UK tried to outlaw BDSM recently,
presumably because it's similar to actual violent crimes (even though it
would be entirely consensual).

If Unplug fails to work on a website, you can send a report to the

I don't see evidence in your quote that implies that.
The section in the PDF (which I can't copy from because it's an un-OCR'd
scan) seems to indicate that:
      * they found the email address (which is the lowest-hanging fruit
        of all of this, given that it just involves a sophisticated web
        search for "silk road")
      * they found a human identity that they could subpoena email and
        financial records of from Google and his bank
      * they found VPNs and servers he had paid for.
I don't think it's a stretch to assume he used his personal gmail
address for buying a VPN or the server host, given that he was using it
to recruit developers.
Alternatively, the IP address of the VPN was already leaking (the PDF
states it was brought to Ulbricht's attention by a user), so the FBI
could very well have found it through that, and then worked backwards.
Ironically, if he had used another Tor hidden service to administer the
server, he might have an easier time now...
It's actually quite easy to send drugs through the mail; that's the
primary way large (mid-level) amounts are sent around the US, at least. Further, the Silk Road culture was to use PGP to encrypt your address to

OCaml.      1. OCaml is more obscure than many languages, but it supports
        programming in imperative, object-oriented, and functional
        styles (though it's obviously best suited for a functional
        style). I've seen people write Java in OCaml and produce clean,
        modular code.
     2. OCaml is used in industrial environments (it's gotten pretty
        popular on Wall Street) and in open-source projects; the
        toolchain is mature and the community is vibrant.      3. OCaml is memory safe, but more importantly, it's type safe, and
        its type system is capable of encoding a great deal of your
        program's correctness. It will take some time to get your
        program to compile, but when it does you have a much stronger
        assurance that your program is correct than you do in C, C++, or
        Java.
     4. OCaml compiles to native code; I'm not sure if deterministic
        builds have been done but they should be possible.      5. (Performance, the hidden elephant in every language discussion
        room) The OCaml team takes security seriously, and OCaml is
        performance-competitive with C. OCaml does tail-call
        elimination, so you can write programs functionally that are
        memory-efficient.
     6. (Weaknesses) OCaml has a global lock due to its garbage
        collection, so parallel programming has to be done with
        processes. This is (IMO) cleaner than in similar situations like
        Python, but is obviously suboptimal. I'd highly recommend reading through this blog series, chronicling a
developer picking OCaml as the language to rewrite a large Python
open-source project in. It doesn't have the same focus as you, but it

directory server can simply record the information, and the anonymity is
broken without using secret-sharing.
I wonder, though, if clients could split and publish shared secrets for
routes, along with some proof they actually used the circuit for what
they claim they used it for. You could do this for hidden services
pretty easily, because their circuits can only be used for one thing,
and they have to publish hidden service descriptors to the directories
anyway; they could also publish a list of relays they had sent shared
secrets to. If those relays had a way of proving they had such a

While this is a subject that most if not all men can discuss neutrally,
it's a much more personal topic for most women, and seeing this
"discussed" (or rather: seeing the sexual assault of women defended) on
this list can polarize people against the Tor project.
Tor as a technology and community helps women and humans far more than
it hurts them, but some hidden services I won't contribute further to
their popularity by naming make compelling news stories, and quotes from
tor-talk are easily misquoted as official statements of the Tor project.
Since Tor's infrastructure relies entirely on volunteer contributions,
this makes discussion of the morality of some hidden services an
existential threat to Tor. These discussions should not be tolerated on
this or other Tor Project mailing lists. There are plenty of other
places to have those discussions, but these lists are not an appropriate
The Tor Project could actively kill these threads, and in my opinion
should, but if they disagree, I hope that others on this list who agree
with some or all of my position help by *never responding* to such
Please do your best to ensure that we can build a world without
surveillance, without panopticon, and with the basic human right to
privacy defended and respected by technology and people.

I've seen Andrew comment on threads saying "I'm killing this thread"
from time to time -- I think this moderation has been extremely helpful
in the past, and if Andrew has gotten too busy to participate in
gardening the mailing lists, I hope his successors keep up this
practice. Just to clarify.

This seems very counterproductive, given that some networks (Tor) are
far more researched and developed than others.
There's a reason why the NSA has "Tor Stinks" presentations and not "I2P
stinks" presentations.

Not really, in 2004 onion routing was well-researched.
Tor is very incrementalist, which is a sustainable strategy for
producing large-scale systems. Dropping something like i2p, with zero
academic background, on the world means you have to analyze an entire
system from scratch, which means in practice nobody but the developers
can comment on it.
I think it's because they're all either abandoned, noticeably insecure,
or in their infancy. Tor is the only one with an active developer
community, a strong basis in research, and a proven track record of
Sometimes questions just have simple answers.

It's not perfect, but using the available information is all we can do.
Absence of evidence *is* evidence of absence, though it isn't proof of
absence. Further, i2p just isn't worth that treatment because it's shoddily
developed by a handful of underfunded developers and it has a totally
untested security model. Tails *just* got burned by i2p and wisely
disabled it. All complex systems have bugs, and finding those bugs is a function of
the aggregate intelligence of your developer base. Unless you can argue
the 5 contributors to i2p are geniuses, then there's no way i2p has
fewer bugs pound for pound compared with Tor. Tor just has way more
intelligent people hard at work both on the code and the theory. To further drive this home, here are other things I'd expect to have
happened if i2p was somehow better or even equivalent to Tor:       * i2p should have attracted academics to the low-hanging fruit of
        showing their unique routing system correct
      * i2p should have attracted developers to the relatively popular
        project of helping defeat censorship and protect privacy (there
        are probably an order of magnitude more Java developers than C
        developers, so i2p even has an advantage here!)
      * i2p should have hosted security-critical sites like the Silk
        Road
      * i2p should have been used by botnets for c&c
      * i2p should have been mentioned in some leak from some shadowy
        security agency
      * The major selling point of i2p should be "proven security over
        alterantives" rather than "developed by anonymous people and not
        funded by the american government", which are secondary rather
        than primary advantages of the software and are respectively
        entirely uncorrelated and only weakly correlated with the
        security of the software
None of these things have happened, and while there are alternative
explanations, one simple and probable explanation is just that i2p isn't
as good.
This is nonelethess a good point and something I'll remember.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question for those who say "Tor is pwned" 
Paul, it pains me to see someone, who has contributed so much to humanity through a long and celebrated career as a scientist, feel the need to engage with what is at worst an agent of some oppressive government hoping to scare people off Tor, and at best a hostile crank.
As a counterpoint, I'd like to thank you for everything you've contributed, and beg the Tor Project to take better care of its public channels of discourse. Things weren't always this way, and regardless of the motivations of those involved, this behavior is an attack that needs to be defended against.
