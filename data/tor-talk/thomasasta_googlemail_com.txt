Anyone wanting to exchange keys?

Hi John
interesting. Maybe you want to look at  , which is as
well a decentral messaging hybrid with XMPP. When you swaped encryption
keys, and set the proxy to Tor, then all friends with the lock-sign in the
friendslist are sent over Tor. All your criteria are given and realized
here, maybe it is worth to think about some integration. FireFloo does not
need a central sever, and hence it is not needed to have a hidden service.
The User-ID is as well detached from the IP or Tor. Maybe you want to check
it out.. or send your key for a test.
Regards Tom

Yes take care and look yourself or believe so called experts or

Hi Grump,
thanks for the classification. who is able to evaluate this? rather than
posting vagueness?
at which apps can you add/apply customized e2e encryption?
as far as it is reported that Tor has no Forward Secrecy from endpoint to
client, some of these apps with a proxy over Tor provide it?
Regards Tom

Hi Anan, there is a p2p URL storage and sharing tool, which is based on
either a SQLite or PostgreSQL DB;
the function is to save your URLs (by RSS or crawler or manual entry),
inkluding the website text and a search engine, which is searching within
your encrypted content of your database: the database is encrypted and so
are the URL transfers from node to another node or DB. Ideal to create an
index of Onion Urls and Websites. Even with revisions for the webesite, in
case two times spidered. See the manual for further details_
The database is symmetrical encrypted, that means with a path DB->Python
(because it has AES encryption) -> Apache -> php/Javascript eith
encryption, one can even bring the URLs to a web interface. That way Tor
URLs can be brought to a web search engine even with content - to refresh
the Website one then need of course to have Tor. This might be part of your
evaluation to store your URLs in a Database, as it is encrypted and
provides options to be searched and brought to your website.
Regards Tom
