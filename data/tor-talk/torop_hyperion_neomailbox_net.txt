I submitted a bug to the torcp bugtracker about the
AllowUnverifiedNodes setting, but wasn't sure what the correct syntax
would be for allowing no unverified nodes.
Is it just "AllowUnverifiedNodes "on a line by itself for none?  I
tried "AllowUnverifiedNodes None" and "AllowUnverifiedNodes Null",
but tor doesn't like any of those lines.  It accepts
"AllowUnverifiedNodes ", but I don't know if that just reverts to the
default of "middle, rendezvous" or does it actually mean none.
