I want to use Thunderbird to access my mail via Tor. What is the recommended best practice to set up TB? Is TorBirdy still the best way to go or is there something new?

Thank you! But, in this case, I specifically need to use Thunderbird on Windows. Yes, i know it's not very secure but it's what I must do.
Thank you,

I understand that. But in the environment where this must be deployed, I cannot use a VM at all. It has to run natively on Windows. So I need to make Thunderbird, running on Windows natively, as secure and anonymous as possible using Tor.
Is Tor Birdy the answer?
