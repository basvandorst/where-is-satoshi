You might not know it, but inside your Intel system, you have an operating system running in addition to your main OS, MINIX. And it’s raising eyebrows and concerns

@_subject: [tor-talk] can't access any web sites through tor network 
Hi, My name is Fran
Some web sites refuse access through tor network. For example, there is a site  which I use to visit (using tor browser) to learning training courses, but a few days ago, this site refuse the access through Tor Network. I can't log in.
Could you advice to me if there is a way to avoid this problem? Thank you very much.

Dears, I am Fran.
I am a new member of this list. I would like to ask you an important question for me:
Using TAILS OS (which forces all Internet connections through Tor Network), I need to get access to data bases related to academic and scientific journals, but connections through Tor Network are refused by those servers, so I must use other OS or other web browser, but I would prefer don't do it.
Is it possible to manage Tor browser settings in order to get into those data bases using Tails?
Sorry for the annoyances and thank you very much for your attention.
Kind regards,

Hi, Whonix is other free distro that forces all Internet connection through Tor Network. However, if your friend search a good tutorial, it is not difficult to install Tails (you need 30 minutes and 2 USB )
