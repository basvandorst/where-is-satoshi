norvid @ 2007/04/05 17:18:
i think what we are trying to say here, is: even though this configuration may prevent java from determining the user's IP, it does not prevent java from determining other personal information.
this information may include: the local time of the user's machine, screen resolution & color depth, operating system & browser version (if this is found to differ from the UserAgent reply, isn't that suspicious?), and probably many, many other items.  these could be just as revealing as an IP address.  so, unfortunately, i don't see the point of this configuration with anonymity in mind.

@_subject: tor-community-approved free pop/imap/smtp mail 
i think i remember seeing this discussion not long ago but, if i remember correctly, it went off on some tangent and there were no results!
what we are looking for: free mail which offers pop/imap/smtp access, approved by the tor community.  what does that mean?  i think we have consensus that the whole system should preserve anonymity, but i'll make clear some of my requirements:
- sign-up page does not require unneeded information
- sign-up page & web interface do not require javascript
- sign-up page & web interface uses ssl
so far, google mail meets these requirements but we all know about their privacy policy! so:
- sane privacy policy
i found safe-mail.net, which is the best i can find in my (extremely) limited search, but still: not free smtp, and no mention of data retention policy.  i would consider paying for an account for not-so-anonymous usage, just to get smtp access.  would someone object to that?
so, also:
- clear data retention policy
- prefer no advertisements inserted into outgoing mails
- other items of concern to the tor community
anything like that exist?  are we really that picky?

well, i've actually got a riseup.net account, and the sign-up process is unacceptable for anonymity.  you need to enable javascript for at least one of the steps during the process, and you have to fill out "why" you want a riseup.net account, then your account has to be approved by an admin.  or, you need to know 2 people who already have an account to give you invite codes.
so far, it seems safe-mail is the way to go.  except that you are bound to using the web interface, i don't see any drawbacks.  their data retention maybe, but that can be inquired about....

when using IRC over Tor, very often my ident is munged into that string.  once is understandable.  the peculiar part is how, if i change Tor circuits (exit node also) and reconnect, i'm connected with that same ident.  it's not constrained to just one IRC network either: it appears to happen across various networks.  anyone else noticing this?
what is even more peculiar to me is that this has still happened (at least once) even when i first connect to an IRC bouncer via SSL connection (using Tor) and then initiate an insecure connection to an IRC network through the bouncer.  the connection between the bouncer and the IRC network is not through Tor, just the connection between me and the bouncer and that is via SSL anyway.....

@_subject: Some of my observations on runing new alpha version of Tor 
Przemyslaw Orzechowski @ 2007/06/13 12:46:
ok, you want the torrc to reside in "C:\Documents and Settings\LocalService\Dane aplikacji\tor\".  you also want the "log on" option to use the LocalService account.  so i would:
1.) close vidalia & stop tor, make sure no tor.exe is running
2.) remove the tor service with command "tor --service remove"
3.) reinstall the tor service with command "tor --service install"
now you should check in the service properties that the command line is correct ("path to executable"):
""C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe" --nt-service"
if it doesn't look just like this, then maybe there is a bug with "tor -install".  you can manually edit the "path to executable" by using regedit and navigating to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tor and then editing the "ImagePath" string so it doesn't have improper quotes, etc.
you also want to put all the options in torrc, including that rogue "ControlPort 9051" that was being put in the command line.
now, you will have a cleanly configured tor service with the torrc, cached-routers, cached-status, etc. in the "C:\Documents and Settings\LocalService\Dane aplikacji\tor\" directory.
so it sounds like there is a problem with the Nickname option?  according to the manpage this option can only use characters [a-zA-Z0-9], so that hyphen is invalid.  i get the same error 7023 when trying that nickname, but everything works OK if i use "popotest"

i seem to be having trouble with this.  i am using 0.1.2.13-win32.
if i first start tor without __alldiractionsprivate, everything works as expected.  then i add __alldiractionsprivate to torrc and reload.  i have it running on a laptop that gets shut off frequently, but it gets access to the internet every <24 hours.
all works well for a few days.  after that, tor can't build any circuits.  what's worse, if i take out __alldiractionsprivate from torrc and reload, tor still won't access the directory servers and build circuits.  after deleting cached-routers and cached-routers.new, then i can get tor to contact the directory servers and the whole process starts over.
so, what's going on here?  i thought tor would access the directory servers using tor circuits and keep an updated list of routers at all times, but that doesn't seem to be happening.

the system gets put into standby frequently, but gets access to the internet every <24 hours.
and where is that age coming from?  that amounts to >37 years....
while Tor is still able to build circuits, it doesn't seem to be able to download updated lists of routers.  then, after several days, there is no way for Tor to build circuits.  is this related to the __AllDirActionsPrivate setting? related to the activity of the system (that is, that it gets put into standby and has intermittent internet access)?

vikingserver at gmail.com @ 2007/10/03 16:19:
i have experienced this also on my windows xp box.  i think it's an issue with vidalia.  for me, it has been occurring for a few versions of vidalia now.  i've never had tor freeze nor push the cpu to 100% nor have i ever had to kill tor.exe because of non-compliance.
on that box i have tor setup as an nt-service, so there is no need for vidalia to start/stop tor.  it is using vidalia-0.0.14 and tor-0.1.2.17.
it seems to occur when tor is downloading routers. vidalia has to parse this and reflect the new list of routers in the "network map" view.  the "newtwork map" view needs to be open.  it also seems to occur if tor is having trouble building circuits and is constantly failing and creating new circuits.  vidalia can't keep up with the updated/active list of circuits.  or, if "close circuit" is used and tor has to build a new circuit, etc. again, this seems to only happen if "network map" view is open.
i'm not certain of this, but i think if vidalia is opened but not used (or, perhaps just the "network map" is not left open), the 100% cpu/freezing does not occur.  someday i might test this hypothesis.  then again, it is windows and i'm well acquainted with needing to kill processes in order to keep the system stable. ;)
these are just observations and i've got no log files to accompany my claims.

coderman @ 2007/09/10 18:16:
so, if we are using a website that uses HTTPS, but, in firefox, for example, in the cookies list under that website it shows "Send for: any type of connection", then the session is vulnerable?  or, we should at least assume that?  if that is correct, is there perhaps a way to force these cookies to be sent over the encrypted connection?  in that cert.org article it says:
i see it is possible to manually set this secure attribute on the cookie using an add-on like add n edit cookies[1], i think.  editing the cookie allows me to change "any type of connection" to "encrypted connections only".
however, even after manually changing this attribute, the website i tested this with reset some of the cookies back to "any type of connection".  the cookies it reset back to this insecure state seemed to be the more private ones, named "Session" and "User", the ones one would *want* to be encrypted.
additionally, even if the website did not reset the secure attribute, who is to say the website will acknowledge my change of the secure attribute and use an encrypted connection?
further, the site i tested this with did not set the cookies until after i sent a user/password over https (logged in), so the initial cookies i received were sent over an unencrypted connection.  even if it was possible to force the cookies to use an encrypted connection afterwards, the attack could have already happened, no?
seems to me we should stop using private, https websites which do not send cookies via encrypted connections, right?

@_subject: [OT] mitigating or defeating syntax analysis 
Hash: SHA256
not exactly sure how to articulate this, but i'll do my best.
assume there is a global adversary trying to track down an anonymous
Tor-user by using syntax analysis.  that is to say, gathering sets of
sentences or paragraphs from e-mails or forums, etc. and then
recognizing similarities in the syntax (that is, the way the sentence or
paragraph is written) in order group anonymous text with non-anonymous
text and ultimately reveal the identity of an anonymous user, based on
the way they write, basically.  the field of psycholinguistics would
probably be a good resource for this type of analysis.
i hope that's clear enough.  so, Tor can help defeat network traffic
analysis.  now, how can the anonymous user (or, more accurately,
talker/writer/blogger) mitigate or defeat this syntax analysis?  are
there any scholarly papers or websites with this information, or at
least talking more about syntax analysis (perhaps there is a more proper
technical term)?  for example, i think one rule would be to always use
proper capitalization and punctuation, something i never do in my
non-anonymous writing. ;)

to do it anonymously, i recommend creating a new account using a new,
anonymous e-mail (if required), all via Tor of course.
as for safely, you can always try changing the url to https, sometimes a
site supports https but doesn't use it by default.  ensure your browser
warns you if parts of the page are unencrypted and when you are
submitting unencrypted information, check to especially make sure the
form submission links will use https.
otherwise, there is no safe way to do it.  you have to be prepared in
this case for your login credentials and entire account to be
compromised.  of course changing your password is futile as that is
probably done in the clear as well.  at least you will remain anonymous.

there's nothing to do in this case either. you have to be prepared for
your session to be hijacked.  at least, in this case, your password
cannot be changed since most sites require re-authenticating to change
the password (and that will be done via https).  always be sure to use
the "log out"/etc. link when done, to update the cookie accordingly.
again, personally, this hasn't happened to me (that i'm aware of).
from what i've casually seen in vidalia, if you are able to switch to
https, cookies are probably also exchanged via https even if they are
set to use "any type of connection" (as opposed to "encrypted
connections only").  i can hypothesize this because i no longer see
connections to port 80 after switching to https.  if the cookies were
being exchanged in the clear there would still be connections to port
80, right?  it seems wondering about this is mostly moot, though, since
the only way to be sure your information is secure is to use https all
the time with cookies set to use "encrypted connections only".  even
then you are placing trust in a CA, which is a third party also subject
to attack. oh my!

this was discussed a bit not too long ago.[1]  check that thread for
some useful links as well.
i learned that cookies have a security attribute which dictates if a
cookie is sent over an encrypted connection or not.  most sites which
require you to logon do not set this security attribute.  so, while you
may be sending your username/password over SSL, the cookie which
contains your "session id",etc. may be transferred in the clear.  so,
instead of an attacker gaining your username/password, they can gain
access to your session and do whatever you would be allowed to do whilst
logged in.  slightly less dangerous.  most sites require you to
reauthenticate before changing your password, so that is probably one
thing the attacker cannot do.
i'm not sure of a way to find out if a site will transfer its cookies
over an encrypted connection, without actually logging in and then
taking a look at the cookies you've received.  you can look at your
cookies in firefox and there is a line "Send for:" which will tell you
the type of connection used.  (maybe you need to install add-on
CookieSafe to see this detailed information).
i also learned, that by using a cookie editor, you cannot force a cookie
to be sent over an encrypted connection.
ultimately, i would recommend turning off cookies all together.  if you
have to logon to some site, i would recommend creating a new anonymous
email to use for that purpose alone.
really, i don't see why the webmasters do not just set cookies to be
sent over SSL.  i'm not a webmaster.  but, is it really that hard?  does
it add that much more overhead than they are already experiencing from
using HTTPS?  or are they just ignorant, lazy?
comments welcome. thanks.

if you have tor configured as an exit node on the same IP address, then
that is probably why.  freenode is probably just looking at the list of
exit nodes and acting accordingly.
i think that IP is generated by the freenode server.  they could have
configured their server to just say that IP address when they ban any

i used to use filezilla, and then the generic proxy option disappeared,

from what i understand, Torbutton should take care of this.  make sure
all of the "crucial" (or "critical" ... can't remember) settings are
activated inside Torbutton.  then, if your IM doesn't work, torbutton is
doing its job.  if your IM is working then it is safe to assume all
traffic is properly being routed thru Tor.
but using pidgin is probably better if that is an option.  there is also
"pidgin portable".

thanks.  i checked that out.  i took the first step of directly
contacting my ISP (Qwest) and mentioned my reasons for running the exit
router, as well as links to the documents mentioned in the first step.
below is the representative's response.  although it is riddled with
misconceptions, the part referring to section 7 of the service agreement
seems relevant.  suggestions?
Dmca violations are treated seriously by Qwest and if they continue you
will lose your DSL service.
You mentioned you were operating a "Tor exit router" which normally is
used for the purpose of
hiding ip addresses. If you are allowing people on the internet to hide
their ip addresses by routing
through your DSL  "Tor exit router", then you are violating your DSL
service agreement with Qwest.
You can find the Qwest DSL service agreement at
Under "7. Service Conditions" it state that your residential DSL service
is only for the use of your  pcs
within your home. You cannot allow others, outside your house,  to use
it for the purpose of hiding their ip addresses.
You also are responsible for any harmful or illegal traffic that comes
from your DSL modem. The fact that
your "Tor service" is a configured to block the most common ports
associated with abuse does not release
you from this responsibility. If you are charging money for the use of
the "Tor service" then you are violating the terms of both your
residential phone service and your residential DSL service with Qwest
as you are not allowed to use either for running a business.

@_subject: cave updates, Qwest 
Hash: SHA256
Hi all.  i just wanted to give some updates regarding my router "cave"
and experiences so far with running a Tor exit on my Qwest home DSL
Where we last left off, i had gotten permission from a Qwest
representative to continue to run a Tor exit.  They had "noted my
account accordingly".  I continue to use the "reduced exit policy" from
Mike's blog.
Unfortunately, there still exist some problems and hiccups i've been
dealing with.  While the DMCA complaints have so far stopped, my
internet has been disabled three times now due to 'malicious' behavior.
Usually i will wake up in the morning to find my HTTP requests
redirected to an internal Qwest website
( explaining that their system has
detected malicious behavior from my computer.  The website provides an
automated means to restore my account and internet access.  I chose the
option "malicious software already removed" and proceed with some
verification and then my access is restored.
However, unfortunately, on the second and third occurrences, their
automated means would not allow my account to be restored, instead
saying "you have failed to remove malicious software" or some such
nonsense.  This entails me calling Qwest technical support and waiting
for them to contact some engineer to restore my account, taking about
20-30 minutes.  They also take that opportunity to tell me they had
detected a 'bot network' on my computers and want to make sure my
anti-virus is updated.  Each time i've reassured them that it is a false
alarm and that account should have been 'noted accordingly'  But so far,
it doesn't seem to have stuck.
Once my account has been restored, I proceed to send an e-mail follow-up
to help at qwest.com with my previous ticket reference to when I was given
the go-ahead to run a Tor router.  I've asked for details on what
malicious behavior was detected and how I can block it, assured them
that none of my computers have viruses, and reassured them that I am not
interested in causing trouble for the company nor violating their
policies.  Unfortunately, all of these e-mails have not been responded
to, so i have no way just yet to move forward in order to mitigate these
malicious uses of Tor.
I'm actually getting a bit frustrated with my e-mails to Qwest seeming
to fall on deaf ears, and was thinking of filing a complaint with the
BBB in order to spur a proper reaction....

some more updates.
i did file my complaint with the BBB.  Qwest seems to have flip-flopped
on their position and is now saying they will not allow the running of
Tor.  So that is all on file with the BBB now.
Even though Qwest has changed their position, i continue to run the exit
node.  My service will get disconnected every few weeks, I will contact
Qwest to re-explain the situation and get my service re-activated.  They
will send me their logs of what is triggering the disconnection.  Each
time i augment my exit policy to try and block the malicious traffic.
I've also been able to squeeze another 6 months of 40M/20M service for
$30/month so i am a bit reluctant to actually jump ship.  I think as
long as they quickly re-activate my service and I continue to be
transparent and active in augmenting my exit policy, I'll be able to
continue this endeavor.
below are the most recent entries that Qwest has forwarded to me.  i'd
like to figure out how to block this.  i will not block port 80, that
will be the last thing i block.  i guess i can try blocking
87.106.24.200 and 74.208.164.166 which are shadowserver sinkholes....

I receive notice quite often (1-2 times/month) from my ISP that they 'detected malicious software' from my IP, ranging from virus, drones, worms, robots, etc.  I am using the 'reduced exit policy' for the node. Fortunately i am able to update my exit policy with a reject entry.  in hopes it will help other operators in preventing false complaints, below i provide the list i have accumulated (over the years, so some entries might be outdated).  If anyone has extras to contribute, please do!
But first i wonder if there could be a better solution.  Obviously if someone out there is using Tor for malicious purposes, sending complaints to the Tor operators isn't going to accomplish anything.  All that we can do is block the IPs on an individual basis, but this doesn't address anything really...  I feel there is little that could be done on either side actually.  It is for this reason that I believe we should encourage sinkhole/honeypot operators to just block/ignore Tor exit IPs that connect to their traps.  what do you all think?
