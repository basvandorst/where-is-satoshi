@_subject: [tor-talk] Free Decentralized VOIP over Tor 
Has there been any proposals to develop a free decentralized VOIP network for Tor? All VOIP traffic would be routed through Tor and every Tor node would have an option  to participate as a server for PTT or Continuous Speech.  This would be a package that could be downloaded with the Tor bundle.

I'd recommend not using Windows OS if you intend to have any privacy at all. Even when using Linux you're still communicating over the internet and your traffic can be monitored in other ways that really has nothing to do with Tor.
In addition to this you have to consider your ISP modem settings that allows automatic port forwarding, and the fact that your ISP or others can probably get into a PC (especially Windows) using those features.
The only real way to be anonymous on the internet is for conscience people like us to work together and create/use tighter security. -------- Original Message --------

Is Mumble cross-platform? I see it's opensource but will it run on Linux OSes? I would appreciate something like this running over Tor on Tails Linux. Possibly with a users directory.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Third-parties tracking me on Tor 
After using Tor for some years I realized that third-parties can determine what sites I visit when watching my internet activity. I'm always using HTTPS and no scripts allowed and other things recommended to make Tor work. My PC operating system is Ubuntu Linux. When I visit hidden services how can they know what site it is or know what site I visit that's not on Tor? How did they know I was using TorMail when it was available and the content of the e-mail I sent?
I need to know how to achieve true privacy while on the internet using Tor. I must be missing something.
Using my own developments, I've been able to achieve privacy but it's too tedious and difficult to maintain.

Hi All,
I was away dealing with some unexpected business. What I explained in my post happened more than once. This third-patry has access to considerable resources and some political influence. They probably paid someone to do surveillance. One incident was after I used a Tor search engine. They had an uncanny way of letting me know exactly what I was searching. Never used that search engine again. Another incident was after I visited a hidden service. This really bothered me because it was confidential. To some extent they knew my plans by watching on Tor.
I apologize for the delay.

In my case the site I went to was on the hidden wiki.

There was one thing strange to me about the search engine. It was too fast for a Tor HS search engine. I assumed the encryption process had been altered or something like that.

I was using Ubuntu Linux installed on a USB drive. The install was done with encryption enabled. No server like SSH etc installed. I understand the sites that aren't on Tor being trackable by watching exit nodes.
How would they know what hidden services I went to or Tormail content? Tormail passwords had limitations on them. I don't understand why. The only thing I'm sure wasn't compromised is what I encrypted myself using my PGP key. I altered the GPG source code to create longer keys. -------- Original Message --------

I have some old friends that have very bad intentions. They're the third-parties. They know what HS I went to and that's enough for serious concern. These people are interested in financial info and anything useful for incriminating.

I can't remember the Hidden Wiki's site address the link was on. The HS site owner was in contact with me via tormail. Shortly after that I picked up on some unusual activity and backed off. This site could have been a setup. I'm not dealing in anything illegal but some things could be used for incrimination and character assassination.

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTP CGI and Tor Hidden Services? 
I'd like to know if HTTP CGI forms and CGI server side programs on a hidden service work the same over Tor as over regular the internet. For example using the Apache HTTP server.
