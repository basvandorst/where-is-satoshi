Do you have a link to the German law text by any chance?
Would be helpful.

@_subject: Spam from this list? OT! 
Apologies for bringing this up. I live a pretty spam-free life and like to keep it that way.
I got three SPAM's today from this list.
As I read the headers, those are coming from the or-talk list server.
Can anyone (spammers) post there or did the server get hi-checked?
Changing my receiving address - my usual counter measure to this - does not work if it comes from the list server.

isn't TOR a volunteer effort?
Are they using TOR and making $$'s off it?
