@_subject: Tor pronunciation 
Hello guys.
I just had one question about the name 'Tor'.
According to the Tor FAQ, Tor is an acronym of 'The Onion Routing network'.
Even though it comes from an acronym, Tor is not spelled 'TOR'.
Now, I wonder how I read Tor...?
Surely, it's not pronounced like 'tee oh ar'.
Is it pronounced like ''?
Does anybody have any idea?

@_subject: A better routing selection mechanism for Tor? 
Using Tor, I wondered why Tor use bandwidth capacity as a key factor
of Tor router selecting algorithm.
After a brief view of Tor source codes, I realized that the bandwidth
capacity of Tor is more similar to the Tor router's packet processing
capability than the network transfer capacity.
While calculating the bandwidth capacity, the capacity of network link
among Tor routers is not considered.
Isn't it better to use the capacity of network link among Tor routers?
Robin Snader's paper, A Tune-up for Tor: Improving Security and
Performance in the Tor Network. has some idea using the network link
I think it is feasible to measure each link capacity among all Tor
routers by using ping packets or other simple mechanisms.
When each router knows the linke capacity with all the other routers,
we can build better circuits than before.
Let's assume that there are 1,200 Tor routers in the world.
In this case, each router needs to have 1,199 link capacity
information with the other Tor routers, not the bandwidth capacity of
the other Tor routers.
The total number of the links that Tor directory server should save is
up to 1,438,800 (1,199 x 1,200).
I guess this mechanism will improve Tor router selection algorithm.
Waiting for some replies.

@_subject: Tor website translation. 
Hello all,
I found that only 2 pages below on the Tor website are translated into
Korean language.
I want to participate in translating the Tor website into Korean language.
How can I start?

@_subject: Tor website translation. 
Thanks for your detail information.
I'll apply the translation files after understanding some issues
related to the translation from the websites you mentioned.
That's also good to translate Vidalia GUI to make more Korean people use Tor.
I found out there're only 3~4 Tor relays in Korea.
We need more Korean relays. :)
I'll be happy if I can dedicate my effort to Tor.
Hope good news soon.
