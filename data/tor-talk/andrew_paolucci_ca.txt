@_subject: [tor-talk] Risk of selectively enabling JavaScript 
You have to keep in mind it's a slippery slop of censoring the content
of users that use the Tor network. If we were to add an option for
filtering out Javascript what would stop a exit-node operator to decide
he wants to filter out any webpages that have keywords in them that he
finds "distasteful".
What I'm saying is by trying to make it safer for the users of the Tor
network you are in turn making the network itself more vulnerable to
censorship by making it easier for exit-node operators to censor
traffic. I know it can still be done by the exit-node operator if they
want to via a proxy with filtering policies, but why make it easier?
