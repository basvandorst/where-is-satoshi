Odd, I will CC the CEO.
No, I mean a properly configured exit enclave which (as I understand it) is
reachable when using Tor without using out-proxies. Out-proxies are the real
choke-point of the Tor network...
Similarity to the real world and/or applicability outside of the testing
environment.  So, would someone in China or Europe get differen circuits, is
using the same IP and Tor node over and over going to create caches, etc.

I doubt it, it's outside the Tor network, so it would have to travel through
an exit node to reach it.  Configuring your Tor node running on
tor.duckduckgo.com may allow people to exit through that node, but I don't
know if it would then become the main route through the Tor network.
Perhaps someone here could clarify?
