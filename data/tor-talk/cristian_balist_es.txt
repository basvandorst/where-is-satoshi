@_subject: [tor-talk] Firewall setting in Tor Browser not working? 
I have a couple of questions about the "Tor Network settings" in Tor
Tor browser can be configure to use bridges and/or pluggable transport
if needed. However it may happen that these PT are exposed on port that
cannot be reached from behind company/university restrictive firewalls.
In the Tor Network settings (clicking on the onion icon) I see that
there is an option that says "This computer goes through a firewall that
only allows connections to certain ports", this option is not available
when ou click on the "Configure" button when you want to configure a
connection when Tor is starting up.
Tor Network settings at startup:
Tor Networks settings from the icon:
My first question is: why there is this difference?
The second question is about how this setting work.
Here's my scenario, born out of testing a bridge with pluggable
transport [1]:
* I start Tor browser normally
* I go to "Tor Network settings" and I put in my bridge with plugglable
* I enable the firewall setting indicating to go through ports 80,443
(default value)
with this configuration Tor Browser does not work.
Note that the bridge works, if I use a proxy to bypass the firewall or
if I connect from a non-firewalled network Tor Browser works normally.
So, how does that setting work?

Thanks for pointing it out!
Yeah, I was under the impression (maybe because the setting was just
below the one about the proxy) that with that setting Tor Browser would
have (somehow) routed all the traffic through the specified ports.
Thanks for your help.
