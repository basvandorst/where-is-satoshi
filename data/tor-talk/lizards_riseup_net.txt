Why? I assure you, our exits are just fine. What's with people responding
so negatively to us donating 360Gbit/s of exit BW?

That would be both illegal and immoral. We're _ethical_ cyberterrorists.

Definitely not going to do an interview with some idiot who spams Tor
related mailing lists with this crap.

It's a bit odd that any of them would have the BadExit flag since it's
pretty unlikely you could pull off a successful Sybil attack from so
tightly grouped hosts.

If you're going to be guessing you should probably point that out instead
of presenting your guesses as facts. We are not trying to flood the dir
with offline relays.
The fact that you've been referring to this as a Sybil attempt since the
beginning just makes you look dumb, there'd be no point in even attempting
with so few /16s.
