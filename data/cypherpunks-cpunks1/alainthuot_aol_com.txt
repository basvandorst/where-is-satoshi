@_subject: CDR: Nostradamus' prophecy for 1999 : finally the truth ! 
Hello !
Your site talk about Nostradamus. I'm very sorry but in quatrain X 72, Nostradamus didn't talk about Mongols, Cassini, comets, wars, eclipses, JFK, the Antichrist, or Osiris !
If you want to learn the truth about Nostradamus' prophecy for 1999, there's a good address :
Nostradamus' prophecy came completely true : the final explanation of the quatrain word by word !
Now, the truth is at last available in English ! + en français  + em português
(I can read an email in english but I can't reply in english because I don't speak english. It's not me who made the translation in english on my site. I can reply in french if you want.)
