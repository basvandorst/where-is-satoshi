Who are you kidding?  All your banking information is stored *at
your bank* today; how is that any different?
OBCrypto: none.

It seems to me that all the things you pointed out are just symptoms
of the Internet growing up.  You mentioned on the one hand that
you don't like the trend that you see culminating in having all
USENET posts be signed, but on the other hand that you'd like to
see a 'sealed package' approach to your packets.
The problem is clear: USENET *isn't* 'sealed packages' -- it's
practically an outdoor billboard.  And I think it's logical to
expect some concensus-based rules for behavior there.  This whole
uproar about 'porno on the net' has to do with how children can
'stumble' upon it, as opposed to, say, renting it from Blockbuster[*].
I'm a little more upbeat than Tim, I guess.  I see the trend toward
'socialization' on the 'public' part of the Internet as ultimately
just fine, and the trend toward finding private means ('sealed
packages') to transmit 'private' goods continuing.  Soon I hope
that there will be as much chance of children 'stumbling upon'
X-rated JPEGs as they can today image satellite-delivered porno in
their heads without a dish.
I think the trend will continue so that people will eventually feel
that their e-mail is about as safe from 'the public' as a phone
call is.  Absolute privacy will be resisted from the top because
being 'in power' means always having a final veto; but what is the
real risk of this?
And don't forget: if you have privacy, you don't need anonymity.
Swiss banks provide the ultimate example.
[*] I think community standards are important.  Whether it's speed
bumps on side streets or calls for silence in a jazz club, the
participants in a group should get to decide what is acceptable
behavior within their group.  That being said, I also believe it
is one of the few roles that a national government to provide is
guidance about a small number of issues (so before you hit that
'R' key, I don't believe that small towns can assert racism in
their town charter ...).

Hey, I tried to explain this, but you missed it: I *don't personally
care* about whether kids see porno.  I *know* that a *huge* percentage
of the population in this country does (sorry for being USA-centric,
but we have [at least for now] the largest net population, so you
can see how this will go ...).  Therefore, I'd like to see a way
for the default be that kids (dare I say everyone!) don't *automatically
stumble upon* it in the open network.  I'm all for parents giving
access to their kids to whatver they feel is right, and I'm all
for adults making that choice as well; but I think that if the
majority of the people in a community don't want the default behavior
to be "click here for tits!" then it's up to us, as technologists,
to provide easy-to-use mechanisms for those who do want to see them
to not infringe on those who don't.
If you want porno on your TV, you can rent it, you can pay-per-view
it, you can get a sattelite dish, or whatever.  But most people
don't want it by default to be on channel 7.  Last time: I *personally*
am not one of them, but it's important to see what the majority
thinks on this issue.
Again, you missed my point.  People *think* they are, and if you
compare "private" calls to "tapped" calls, you'll see that the
expectation of privacy is not so misplaced.  Yes, if your communications
are important to you or you are a potential target of investigation,
you should know it's not private.  But it's not like any significant
number of phone calls are tapped, by the government or otherwise.
And it's not likely to happen, either, because NONE CARES WHAT YOU
SAY TO YOUR FRIEND ON THE PHONE.
And I'm sure you do this, what, 18,000 times per hour?  I'm like
so sure that you listen to all your neighbors phone calls.
You can get a numbered account at a Swiss bank by showing up at
the branch, introducing yourself to the branch manager, proving to
him who you are, and signing some papers.  They will keep your name
out of any transactions you make, but they *know you* ... this is
not anonymity; this is merely privacy.
Another good example is John Perry's PGP'd mailing list.  No chance
of anyone "stumbling upon" the content, since it's all PGP'd.  But
it's not anonymous, and for good reasons.  So what if all mailing
lists were like this?  What if alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.oral
was like this? What if all our mail programs and news readers were
able to cope easily with this?  I think this is the question that
efforts like IPSec are trying to answer: we'd all be *way* better
What if looking at a JPEG were like buying beer?  The default is
that a 12 year old isn't going to fool the guy at 7-11, but if
their parents buy a beer and give it to 'em, what the heck?
Consuming alcohol is not regulated; *purchasing* it is.
Don't forget: the fact that "porno on the net" (for instance) is
an issue *at all* is a *failure* of technology.  It would be a
non-issue if USENET wasn't essentially a technology vacuum.

Sorry to inject a little scholarly research on this topic, but I
would urge those of you who are interested in how this mythology
was created and disseminated to do an AltaVista serach for Alperovitz;
he's potentially the leading scholar on this subject.  I've read
his book, and Tim probably ought to as well ...
If you read nothing else on this topic, I urge you to check out
an interview with him at

By the way, the certainly *is* a crypto-relevance to this thread,
since much of what we knew at the time about the Japanese high
command and their motivations and actions was learned through MAGIC
intercepts.  It also has quite a lot to do with how these intercepts
(and related documents) were released over time; the intentionality
of what was released, when, and how shows a good deal about how
this subject was managed by our government.
Since I practically started it (by calling into question Tim's
recitation of the story invented about the 500,000 Americans "saved"
by dropping the bomb), I'd like to call on those who are interested
in it to do some more searching, reading, analyzing and talking.
But not here.

And then:
You make a deposit or something?  How does the transaction clear?
When they finally look in the envelope, they credit the card?
Or do you mean just 'anonymous' between the user and the merchant?

I'm confused as to how "merely" putting your after-tax (you *will*
declare this consulting revenue on your Schedule C, won't you?) bucks
in an offshore account will "save" you money.  This only "works" if you
are able to use what you've taken away to advantage; you may generate a
tax "savings" on those gains.  Oh, and it also only works if you are
willing to expose yourself to being arrested at some point for tax
This is silly; there are legitimate reasons for structuring business
efforts in other tax juristictions.  Avoiding income tax on your
primary source income isn't one of them.
My answer to the original question: save your $1k you'd send to Sandy
for the "advice" (plus travel associated with finding your 'haven') and
open a SEP.

That reminds me that I have been meaning to send out what I use for PGP
and ucbmail.  First of all, since you can ~| outgoing messages, I don't
need any support for sending.  For receiving, there's two ways to
'edit' messages: 'e' invokes $EDITOR and 'v' invokes $VISUAL on a
message.  I actually use 'v' so I set $EDITOR (in my .mailrc) to
~/bin/mypgp which looks like this:
So to read a PGP'd message, I just type 'e' ...
Anyone else do something interesting with ucbmail?
