@_subject: anonymus@charcoal.com is going away 
It seems unsatisfactory for people to have to accept either all mail
from the remailer or none.  Can you not allow recipients to block mail
only from specific ids?  The sender of the mail can probably arrange
to send from a new id instead, but they're unlikely to if they're not
told that their mail was refused by the recipient.

@_subject: Useless anonymity 
We are accustomed to seeing useless messages of various sorts on this and
other electronic forums.  Messages that quote a long article only in order
to add "Me too" at the end, messages of no interest to anyone but the
individual they are directed to, content-free banter, ego-driven flame
wars, and so on.  They still happen -- inexperienced people are always
joining the net -- but most people eventually learn to avoid making these
faux pas.
Anonymity brings a new class of useless message, of which the following
from Black Unicorn  is a recent example.  I quote
it in its entirety:
"Black Unicorn" is an obvious pseudonym, and I'm assuming that it is not
one with an established reputation.  (For all I know, "Black Unicorn" might
be as famous as the Legion of Doom, but for the sake of argument I'll
assume that it isn't.)
What is the use of an unsubstantiated assertion, from an unreputed[*]
source, with no means of verification?  Having read Black Unicorn's bald
asertion, I am as ignorant as before of whether numbered accounts exist, in
Liechtenstein or elsewhere.
New ideas or arguments can be useful regardless of their source.  Likewise
pointers to places where evidence may be obtained.  Assertions by reputable
sources may be taken on trust (I place far more weight on Perry Metzger's
comments about numbered accounts than the Black Unicorn's).
The quoted message does none of these.  It is wholly useless, a waste of
its author's time, and of ours.
[*] "unreputed": a word I just coined as an opposite to "reputable",
meaning not "disreputable", i.e. having a bad reputation, but having no
reputation at all.

@_subject: anonymous postings and trust 
It's mainly the lack of detail.  As you and others point out, any "Fred
Jones" might be a covert pseudonym, and even if it isn't, I may know
equally little about its holder as abut a "Black Unicorn".  So yes, it's a
matter of reputations rather than true names.  Obvious anonymity just makes
it more noticeable.
Somehow, this makes your posting about the existence of Liechtenstein
numbered accounts much more plausible, even though I have no practical way
of verifying any of the circumstantial detail which (to coin a phrase) adds
verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative.  I can't
put my finger on why this is.
Even though you don't really know who I am?  I mostly lurk here, but
although I'm moderately active on a couple of other mailing lists and
newsgroups, even if you looked at what I write there and verified the info
in my .sig, it seems to me you'd need to do some further investigation to
be safe in making potentially job-threatening disclosures to me over any of
these media.
This raises the question of how we come to trust people in RL situations
where obvious anonymity is not present.  In short, why should we believe
anything that anyone says at all?  If we don't check their claims by
personal observation, why believe them?  If we can check them, why not do
so instead?  How is a reputation for trustworthiness built in the first
I'm just rambling, so I'll shut up for now.

Don't look at the readable id, look at the an12070 part.  Whether S.Boxx ==
L.Detweiler or not, S.Boxx and Zen Master (and one or two other nyms) are
posting from one and the same account.

@_subject: MacPGP 2.3 sources 
According to the ftp log, 10 people have so far obtained copies of the
MacPGP 2.3 source that I offered.  Unfortunately, a local problem
unconnected with ftp brought all processes on my machine to a halt at the
weekend, and no further sessions were possible until I cleared the fault
this morning.
Connected with the fault, if anyone knows of the domain name or whereabouts
of the machine with IP number 179.135.226.153, I would be most interested
in contacting its manager.
I'm back from my travels a day earlier than I expected, but I'll leave the
PGP stuff available until I said I would, i.e. 8:00 GMT Friday 8.

@_subject: MacPGP 2.3 source 
Apparently there's a basic incompatibility between ftp and the auto-backup
program which runs every now and then on my Mac, which brings everything to
a halt if anyone connects to ftp while the backup is being done, so I'll
have to remove the MacPGP source from the ftp area on my Mac.  But I'd only
promised to keep it there until this morning anyway.
However, the sysadmins happen to have just set up a properly supported anon
ftp area, so I've put the stuff there instead, where it can probably remain
indefinitely.  The site to ftp to is ftp.sys.uea.ac.uk, and the files are
in the directory ftp/Macintosh.  (Ignore the .finderinfo and .resource
subdirectories -- it's an AppleShare thing, your computer wouldn't
understand, at least not over the Internet.)

Used to be that it was only Usenet that got pestered by children at the
start of every academic year.  Now they're getting wise to mailing lists.
Inevitable, I suppose.
Do the owners of this list have any policy on kicking people off?  Or is it
better to just ignore them, lest, like antibiotic-resistant bacteria, they
learn to disguise themselves more effectively?

"It's a fact of life" is a fact central to the, ahem, cypherpunk cause.
Virtual personas are here.  The only question is how this will change the
way people deal with each other over the net.
That is one possibility: people start signing posts with IDs that
verifiably mean something over a wider range of net and RL spaces than just
a single small world like cypherpunks at com.toad.  Personas which consist
only of postings here might come to be taken less seriously, even if their
content appears useful and constructive.
I do not see what authoritarian action is needed, desirable, or practical. I would rather see a consensus emerge over how to behave in this new

@_subject: Security of PGP private keys 
PGP secret keys are protected by a password.  Yet people have said that one
should not keep one's secret keyring on an insecure machine.  Why?

@_subject: Signing our keys 
Certification establishes a relationship between a public key and a True
Name.  When there is no True Name, or the True Name is not to be revealed,
certification is irrelevant.  For a nym to prevent anyone else for
masquerading as itself, it should announce a public key in its first
appearance on the net, and thereafter sign every message with its private
key.  This guarantees that all such messages emanate from those with access
to the private key.  Certification is irrelevant.
What does become difficult for a nym is key revokation.  If the nym's
private key is compromised, anyone with access to it can send a message
purporting to revoke the key and announcing a new one.  Such a revokation
cannot be certified unless its issuer not only reveals their True Name but
somehow establishes to the satisfaction of whoever is certifying it that
they are the True Name of the nym.
Or as someone put it more succinctly, keys *are* the identities of the
future net.

@_subject: Source for MacPGP 2.3 
In fact, I've found that I do have the source for MacPGP 2.3 (although
someone told me the source wasn't released yet).  I can't remember where I
got it though.
I won't undertake to email it to anyone, nor to place it on anonftp
indefinitely, as the only anonftp area I have is on my desktop machine.
However, I'm not going to be around for about a week, so I'm willing to
make it available during that time.
Any last-minute demands for me not to do this for some reason?  Tough, I'm
about to leave, after which it's out of my hands.
                One-time offer, valid for one week only!!
                =========================================
MacPGP2.3 application, documentation, and source (for Symantec (Think) C
5.0.4), will be available by anon ftp on jrk.sys.uea.ac.uk, from Thurs 30
Sep (today) 14:00 GMT until Fri 8 October 08:00 GMT.  Note that this
machine is in the UK.  It is the responsibility of those accessing it to
satisfy themselves of the legality of their actions.  These files are
available strictly on an "as-is" basis, with no warranty, express or
implied, concerning their contents.
ftp to jrk.sys.uea.ac.uk and give the following commands.
        user anonymous
(Give your email name as password...or not.  All transfers will be logged.)
        cd "RK's Public Folder"
(Yes, there are spaces in the name of the directory.  This is a Macintosh.)
        ascii
        get macpgp2.3src.sea.hqx.pgp
(NB. If you are ftp-ing from anything but another Mac, the above file must
be transferred in ASCII mode.)
        binary
        get macpgp2.3.sit
Once you have these files, you need to do the following steps:
0.  Put both files on a Mac, if they aren't there already.
1.  Use Stuffit 1.5.1 or any decoder (such as DownLine) which understands
that format to decode macpgp2.3.sit.  This will give several files, one of
which is the MacPGP 2.3 application.
2.  Use the application to verify the signature on macpgp2.3src.sea.hqx.pgp
and to strip the ascii armoring from it, creating a file
macpgp2.3src.sea.hqx.  (If you already have PGP on a unix machine, you can
do this there and then transfer the .hqx file to the Mac.)
3.  Use a BinHex decoder to decode macpgp2.3src.sea.hqx.  This yields an
application macpgp2.3src.sea.
4.  Run that application, and it will decode itself into the source for
Paranoids should note that macpgp2.3.sit is not PGP-signed, and you only
have my word that it does what I say it does.  macpgp2.3src.sea.hqx.pgp is
signed, but not by me, and I am not in a position to certify its signature.
 I use MPW C, so I haven't even compiled the source myself.
I am *not* able to answer any questions about MacPGP itself, nor will I or
anyone else be available during the coming week to sort out any ftp
problems.  I will probably be out of reach of email during that time as
