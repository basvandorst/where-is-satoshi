Its funny when the tables are turned.   Long before Google Maps or Earth
was released, was Cryptome's Eyeball series, which used internet mapping
and photos mined from internet sources to raise awareness about
different places.  For exampe here's a recent Eye-Ball report:
The best one was when Cryptome published the address, maps, aerial
photos to convicted/pardoned felon Admiral John Pointdexter who promoted
the "Total Information Awareness" program in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
