I got information from my Senator on the proposed new currency.  Not the
recent changes, but the new bills coming in a year or two.  He got it from
the Treasury (big letters across the top) but the FAX id info says DEA.
It mentions 'Machine Detectable Thread' and "Additional Machine-Detection
Features' but does not elaborate.
If it's machine trackable (I remember hearing about machine readable serial
numbers a couple of years ago) we can always set up cash exchanges.  Might
even be able to make a profit at it!

The wise _Adam Philipp_ is known to have said...
I though all the $10,000 had been accounted for.  Are there really some
left running around?  Any idea how much one is worth?  Last time I heard
of a $1000 going to auction, it sold in excess of $7000.
