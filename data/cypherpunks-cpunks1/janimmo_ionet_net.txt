@_subject: On the Hill: Child Porn "Morphing" 
I've heard of this kind of thing before. Individuals have already been sent to jail for doing this, as well as doing and distributing kiddie porn drawings. I suspect that since it's already illegal on the state level, that Congress is looking into making it a federal crime to distribute them over state lines via the Internet.
It only has to give the impression of being under the age of consent in order to be illegal. No real models have to be involved.
That's debatable. However, in this politically correct environment, I wouldn't even give the impression of siding with the pedophiles if I were I wouldn't doubt it.

I would put it to you that being branded a pedophile and kiddie-porn operator can have worse implications than jail. For instance, I believe that even without a conviction, restraining orders can be placed which would prevent you from coming within a certain number of feet of children. If it were publically known you would almost certainly lose your job. I also imagine it would be hell on your marriage.
All this can result from an arrest, not necessarily a conviction.
Besides, I wouldn't count on the courts to uphold our rights. The Supreme Court just upheld civil forfeiture, allowing the cops to sieze your property without due (or any as far as I'm concerned) process of law.
I believe that like all porn, it's a reasonability issue. If a "reasonable" person would believe that the person depicted in the drawing or morph to be underage, that it's illegal. I'm not sure, but I'll bet Sternlight would have an opinion. Anyone care (dare) to ask?
That's a good point. Anonymity makes it possible to ask questions that would be too embarressing or damaging to ask otherwise. It makes me wonder what would have happened if the Cypherpunks had been around in the McCarthy era.

Apparently noone in this country knows how to: 1. Read the help file sent out automatically upon
   subscription.
2. Spell "unsubscribe."

How exactly would this be done? Since messages from alpha.c2.org
are conventionally encrypted, they don't contain key id's. Wouldn't that require every recipient to store his/her passphrase
and call pgp for every message to see if it could be decrypted? This in
and of itself would be a more serious security breach, not to mention an _enormous_ drain on site resources.

@_subject: anonymous mailing lists 
OK, so now I'm downloading twenty times as much anonymous mail (the original
scenario called for a 20:1 increase). Suppose for a minute that I'm doing
something really silly, like subscribing to cypherpunks through a nym (as some do). Now, instead of an average of sixty messages a day, I'm getting twelve hundred. I think my ISP might have something to say about that.
Also, who on earth would be willing to even double the load on his server in order to enact this? I doubt that Mr. Parekh or anyone else would do it.
Can anyone do the math as to what the quotient would have to be in order to
defy traffic analysis? It seems to me that even twenty to one would fool a determined attacker only for a while. After all, we're not talking about a very large pool. Presumably only those individuals who had a nym
on a particular server would be chosen for this mail blind.

@_subject: Unused WWW and anon FTP space 
Greetings Cypherpunks:
I have no idea if this is the appropriate place or way to broach this
topic, but I have a great deal of space on my account that is just
going to waste. I am allowed a www page, and in a couple of weeks my
shell space quota will be upgraded to 20 meg, with anon ftp
capability. As I said, this is just going to waste, so I was wondering if anyone
had some faqs, files, or whatever that they wanted to distribute or if
anyone needed space for a web page. Frankly, I've never written an
html document, but I suppose I could learn.
Please respond directly, as I'm sure that the rest of the list doesn't
want to hear the responses.
