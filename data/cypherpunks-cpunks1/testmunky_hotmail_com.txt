Hi!  It's Stephen, again!
How are you?  I found you on   Remember?
ANYway, some people (just a very few) were angered by my last poem, though most were very happy to read it.  A few bad apples, and all that...
They're trying to shut me down, but they can't take my database away from me.  Or my poetry.
Here's another one (about my mother - she's dying of Alzheimers - it's really awful):
OH, THE BLACK GARDENS
March 31, 2000
she listens at the whispers
when they hasten to her door
her keen eyes upon the shadows
that make a hateful, bloody war
across her ceiling and her walls
without regard for private places
but muster in her drawers
and make within her closets
such awful, spiteful faces
for she listens with the whispers
when they cry out for revenge
for the catcalls oft returned
from beneath the wells of shade
so long harbored safe
beneath her bed
and listening to her whispers
so carefully from her chair
she may let slip her cautious grip
she may unwind
her twisted hair
she may let go all meaning
as a tumbler slips the wire
she may free fall through black gardens
where little girls dance
but never tire
