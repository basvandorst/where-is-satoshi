I looked at the Nevada PUC (PUCN) web site and found that the most recent document on-line that relates to docket  "dkt_00-6057/00-6057.htm"}00-6057 (EDDIE MUNOZ VS CENTRAL TELEPHONE COMPANY-NEVADA DBA SPRINT OF NEVADA, COMPLAINT ALLEGING INCOMING CALLS ARE BEING BLOCKED OR DIVERTED FROM CUSTOMERS BUSINESS) is from 04/07/02 - and the link is broken.  Clearly the below referenced document (Nortel codes) will not appear on-line -- at least not courtesy of the PUCN.  However, chapter 703, "PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF NEVADA - GENERAL PROVISIONS", of the Nevada Revised Statues states) among other NRS 703.190 Records open to public inspection; exception.
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all biennial reports, records, proceedings, papers and files of the commission must be open at all reasonable times to the public.
2. The commission shall, upon receipt of a request from a public utility, prohibit the disclosure of any information in its possession concerning the public utility if the commission determines that the information would otherwise be entitled to protection as a trade secret or confidential commercial information pursuant to {HYPERLINK "NRS-049.html" \l "NRS049Sec325"}NRS 49.325 or {HYPERLINK "NRS-600A.html" \l "NRS600ASec070"}600A.070 or Rule 26(c)(7) of the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon making such a determination, the commission shall establish the period during which the information must not be disclosed and a procedure for protecting the information during and after that period.
[Part 12:109:1919; 1919 RL p. 3157; NCL ' 6111](NRS A 1995, I don't know what the legal definition of "confidential commercial information" is, but I doubt that the code list could be construed as a trade secret *of the utility*, perhaps of Nortel, but according to the statute only the utility can move to limit public access to the documents.  Perhaps this document is currently accessible in hard copy in NV?
I wonder how many people have visited the PUCN office in the past three days!
