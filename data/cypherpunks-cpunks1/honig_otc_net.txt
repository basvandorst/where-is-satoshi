This excerpt made clear for me the distinction: 1. There is a temporary problem with forgery & retribution, but this goes
away when the populace gets a clue about authentication.  In this case,
technology and a little cultural learning solve a social problem.
In practice, this cultural awareness could be encouraged by spamming the
masses with letters from various interesting forged parties, e.g., irs.gov.
 Or spoofing a  public news streams and messing with the stock market.  I wonder if the recent classified government report
on infohacking the infrastructure included these pranks?
But enough gedankenpranking. Getting a copy of PGP integrated into
everyone's grandmother's GUI email clients, so that this is widely used and
understood by the masses, is the positive way to do this.
2. There is an everpresent truly social problem with people who want to
control the configuration of other people's bits.
This problem is solvable by a set of strongly-enforced rules (e.g.,
"Freedom of speech" -more generally, freedom of information storage and
manipulation in any form) which would have priority over the behavior of
the  mobs (e.g., in the voting booth).
In the US we're supposed to have this but there is some question ---perhaps
we need to hold lawmakers personally criminally liable when they pass
unconstitutional laws--- however the architecture is sound if implemented
So in the future we'll not trust anything without a public key, censors
will be laughed at instead of getting congressional time, and anonymity
will be commonplace and as understood as digital signatures.
I guess this list is pretty much an ill-tempered
view of the future..

Tuesday December 2 12:07 PM EST Hate e-mail case to be retried
SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 2 (UPI) _ Saying the case has national importance,
federal prosecutors will
retry a 20-year-old man accused of sending threatening electronic mail to
Asian students at UC Irvine. Prosecutors announced their decision while opposing a bail request for
Richard Machado of Los
Angeles, the first person in the United States to be tried on charges of
committing a hate crime over the
Internet. His first trial on those charges ended with a deadlocked jury in November.
Jurors voted 9 to 3 to acquit
the former UC Irvine student. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Genaco told Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler
that it is important that the
case be resolved because other similar cases are certain to occur. Stotler denied bail for Machado, noting that he fled to Mexico when he was
first charged. Machado's retrial is scheduled to begin Jan. 27. _- David Honig 			honig at alum.mit.edu

Wednesday December 17 11:58 AM EST New Law Crack Down on Internet Theft
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Clinton signed into law on Tuesday a
controversial bill imposing criminal penalties on
copyright violators even if they do not profit from their actions, the
White House executive clerk's office said Wednesday. The No Electronic Theft Act, passed by Congress last month, was strongly
backed by the software and entertainment
industries but opposed by science and academic groups. Under the law, a person who "willfully" infringes on copyrighted material
worth at least $1,000 could be subject to criminal
prosecution even if he does not make money. Under current law, copyright violators cannot be charged with criminal
misconduct unless they profit from the violations. Software and entertainment groups, including the Business Software
Alliance, the Motion Picture Association and the
Association of American Publishers, said the change was essential to
protect software, music recordings and other creative
products easily pirated over the Internet. They cited a 1994 court case dismissing criminal copyright charges against
an Massachusetts Institute of Technology student
who posted on the Internet for free downloading copies of popular software
programs. But last month a leading group of scientists, the Association for
Computing, wrote to Clinton asking him to veto the bill
because it might inadvertently criminalize many scientific publications
available over the Internet, and might limit the "fair use"
doctrine. The new law includes a sliding scale of penalties depending on the severity
of the copyright infringement. For making one or more copies with a total retail value of at least $1,000
but less than $2,500, the violator could be imprisoned
for up to one year and fined up to $100,000. For copies with a retail value of $2,500 or more, the violator could
imprisoned for up to three years and fined up to $250,000.
A second offense could lead to a prison term of up to six years.       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

I was alluding to the licensing of ordinary photocopiers and fax machines
(and computers, and now internet connections) in statist nations, to prevent their "misuse".  In the 50's, the government should have (from the control point of view) used the hysteria of the times to regulate
*domestic* use of reprogrammable computers.  As far as justification, bring up the baddies and the sheep cower: the
communist dope smoking child
pornographers with ties to Libya.  What's a little liberty for security? :-<
The develoment of computers can be traced along numerous threads.  One
thread (from say the 40's to 50's)
traces the encouragement of the codebreaking, ballistics, h-bomb fluid
dynamics, and missile
control community.  By the 50's the computer was done, and improvements were just making better
It is admittedly oversimplifying to follow only one thread (e.g., only
mathematical or engineering development),
but in the early days (way before intel) computers were built for the uses
I describe.

I.e., people not working for the government have no first-amendment claims
agains their employer since the *first amendment constrains only government*.
Marc, you have declared how far you take freedom: you apparently
believe it is proper for the government to intervene in private hiring
decisions.  Unfortunately many americans believe this intrusion is justified.
A less statist viewpoint holds that government should not be used to control
employment  since both parties consent voluntarily -and therefore,
an employer has the right to hire and fire at will -including for
'distasteful' reasons.
The issue is confounded in the anecdote because the employer is government
in this case, and we might expect government to be obligated to hire and fire only on the
basis of merit.  In a *free* world *employers* can fire for speech;
government can't
interfere in speech.  In the US today, employers do not have that freedom.  Government outlaws
employers freedom to hire and fire ---except against recreational
pharmaceutical consumers--- and the populace considers this permissible in
the name of harmony.  If one ever questions this in public, as Tim did, the liberal response is
to show that
unPC 'discrimination' is possible if humans are free, and then the dutiful
citizen gladly sacrifices employers' liberty for their warm and fuzzy
The first amendment is about what government can't do to you, not what your
neighbor can or can't do.

Note that if the library in question were not arm of the State,
noone would have any First Amendment claim.
This is reminiscent of TM's recent (controversial) analysis of the fired
county trashworker/author,
and suggests a clearer example of the confusion caused by State as Employer:
It is considered legal and moral for a *private employer* can use
censorware to restrict their LAN's access.
But if the employer is the State, and does this, the First might be dragged
in -confusing the issue,
since the government acting as State is constrained (by the constitution)
differently from the government
acting as Employer (constrained by employment law).
Perhaps some critical of Tim's analysis think that when government is
employer it can't censor its LAN?  Can't remove games from government owned
PCs?  When the government removes games, pictures, etc. from its PCs it is acting
as a responsible efficient employer.
When the government attempts to remove games, pictures, etc. from stores it
is acting criminally.

A partial answer on why feedback is better than codebook mode: consider a video signal, with large amounts of uniform background.  Encrypted
with a codebook mode cipher, silhouettes will be visible since the uniform
will map to the same cipher value.  NB: the "uniformity" must span a block,
e.g., 64 bits for BF.
The tradeoff is 1. slightly increased latency & complexity 2. an error in
your output stream mangles
more data than in ECB mode.
Feeding a stream of zeros into a feedback-mode cipher produces a
pseudo-random output stream...in a good cipher.

The interplay between levels of abstraction ---recognizing words in the
plaintext language, and reconstructing the key together from statistical and other constraints
(Ch. 4)--- is what's similar between Hofstadter's model and what the field manual describes.
Caveats: Hofstadter's book is very dry.  The Field Manual only mentions
that computers may be useful,
and gives advice that may have been useful 70 years ago.

Since I grew impatient navigating geocities' UI,
I am sending this in the hope that it will be useful.
Propogate at will.
Using Eudora+PGP 5 with
2.6.2-Compatible RSA Keys
for Win95 for Dummies
honig at alum.mit.edu
I explain how to install and use the slick Eudora and PGP 5 freeware on Windows95 while maintaining full back-compatability with PGP v. 2.6.2 users. The installation path for compatability with 262 is not the obvious one
a new user would take.  Thus this document.
The install takes about 10 minutes and the software is free.  The strength
of your key is the same.
What is Eudora?  PGP?
Eudora is a popular, powerful, easy to use GUI POP3 email client.  Free
are available.
PGP is a public-key encryption package.  PGP 5 freeware includes a plug-in
for Eudora,
making secure email not only possible, but nearly transparent.  That is key
to widespread
use which is key to the success of any protocol.  But some people use only PGP 2.6.2, or 262 it is built into their MacOS.
The problem is that
262 uses "RSA" keys only, but PGP 5 can also use "Diffie-Hellman" keys.  In
the freeware version of PGP 5 does not allow the creation of RSA keys.
These instructions tell you how to set up Eudora + PGP so you can
painlessly use these tools with all popular PGP versions.  The newer PGP does not generate keys that the earlier PGP can use; but the newer version imports them.  So if we take the trouble to use the older
version of PGP to make our key, we can use our slick GUI email tools with
everyone, even the 2.6.2 throwbacks who probably use rotary phones,
carburators, etc.
I use "PGP 2.6.2 key" to mean the RSA key version supported by PGP 2.6.2,
and "PGP 5 key" to mean the
Diffie-Hellman key supported by the freeware version.  Both variants are
based on the ease
of multiplying two numbers and difficulty of factoring the product of large
indivisible ("prime") numbers.
Installation Instructions
You will use defaults everywhere.
1. Download and install Eudora lite 3.05 (eul305.exe)
2. Download and install PGP 5 freeware (pgpinstall.exe)
Easier Setup If You Can:
1 & 2. Download Eudora + PGP together HERE'S THE RETRO-COMPATABILITY PART
3. Download pgp262.zip.  4. Create a 2.6.2 key with PGP 2.6.2:
5. Export your 2.6.2 key to a file:
6. Import your key into PGP 5:
7. Make sure your PGP262 key is your Default (e.g., if you made a PGP 5 key):
TO TEST PGP
Send yourself a regular email addressed to the username you used above,
which should
be your email address, to verify that functionality didn't break.  Then
send a second letter, this time, select Eudora's PGP MIME button AND the
PGP Encrypt button.  Then send your letters.  Wait a bit, and retrieve your
mail as you did before.  To read the encrypted version run the Plug-in.
You will be prompted for your passphrase.
If one of your dinosaur 2.6.2 associates sends you a block of text, use the
PGP Decrypt button.  You will be
prompted for your passphrase.
To send email to other people, you will have to import their public keys.
Security Note
Your private key is hidden in the \Program Files\PGP\PGP50\SECRING.SCR
file.    Its also
in the c:\pgp262\SECRING.PGP file.
If threse files are copied by opponents, only your passphrase stands
between them and your secret key.
Your mykey.asc file is the opposite: it should be published so people can
send messages to you (and verify that you signed and sent what was received
by them, etc.) PGPKeys lets you export your key to a well-known server
which functions like a phone directory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Citing the case of a woman who claims she got
pregnant from e-mail, an Ohio Democrat called Wednesday for a "chastity

speech about a woman named Frances who claimed to have gotten pregnant
through an e-mail exchange with a paramour 1,500 miles away. "That's right -- pregnant," the Congressman proclaimed, warning of the
dangers of "immaculate reception." He called on Congress to go beyond "v-chips" that would protect kids from
sexual content on the Internet, saying: "Its time for Congress to act. The
computers do not need a v-chip. The Internet needs a chastity chip." Although Traficant did not say whether he believed the woman's account, he
did say it was "enough to crash your hard drive."       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

One of the issues is that the fast rise-times on signals yields
emissions all over the spectrum, not just at the base scanning rate.
Thus, even though you're sending at e.g., 2400 bps, you've got an N-volt
voltage/current swing accomplished in fractions of a microsecond.
These higher harmonics radiate better than the lower ones.

Research into the possibility of picking up the
electromagnetic radiation originating from video
display units (VDUs) made clear that this type of
information theft can be committed very easily
[1]. It is not only this type of equipment which
is vulnerable to interception at a distance;
experiments on eavesdropping RS-232 cable
signals prove that it is possible in some cases to
intercept data signals running along an RS-232
cable, by picking up and decoding the
electromagnetic radiation produced by the
cable. This report gives the results of these
Electromagnetic radiation arising from RS-232 cables may
contain information which is related to the original
RS-232 data signals. The seriousness of eavesdropping
risks is shown by estimates of bit error rates feasible with
a standard radio receiver as a function of the separation
distance. In addition to this, results of experimental
eavesdropping are presented.
Keywords: RS-232 cable, Electromagnetic radiation, Eaves-dropping
Caution: Failure to detect intelligible emanations by the
methods described in this paper do not mean an
installation is secure against interception by
sophisticated and resourceful opponents.

the roads' bandwidth is already exceeded and congestion persists after the

At *least* once a month a major piece of freeway is shut down for
an hour or so for "police activity", one hears on traffic reports, often
around rush

@_subject: Algorithms used in PGP 5.x; Relative strength of Blowfish 
Before you can measure something's strength, you have to define
the stress.  Are you twisting it or bending it?  Compressing or pulling?
Are you trying an exhaustive keyspace search?
Are you trying to find a weak key?  Or some information leaking through?
Can you pick the plaintext to put through the system, and twiddle bits?
Or does your adversary only have access to some plain + cipher pairs?
None of the algorithms has been shot out of the water.  All of them annoy
statists, since
they can use more bits than is convenient to search through.  That's why
anything is laughable.  3DES uses 3 x 56 bits of user key, 56 bits being the DES keylength, defined
by the Feds
by neutering IBM's Lucifer system.  DES uses some fixed tables with unknown
(but upon investigation, apparently good) properties.
Blowfish uses over 4Kbytes of internal key, derived from a user-key
of up to 448 bits by mixing the user-key with random digits in a
expensive way that slows keysearch.  Both Blowfish and DES are based on Feistel networks, ie, iterations
of rounds containing permutations, substitutions, addition and xors,
including data-dependant operations (ie, one fraction of the input data
(as well as the user's key, or derivations thereof) modifies the other
fraction in each round).  The 'fractions' are usually halves, but
unbalanced feistel networks have been studied too (e.g., McGuffin
algorithm).  BF was
designed with modern 32-bit cpus (and their cache sizes) in mind.
3-DES is a temporary kludge.
IDEA doesn't use tables, but uses the shift operator which the others
don't.  This is newer (less historical scrutiny) than DES or BF's structure.  IDEA is
patented, the
others aren't.
You should find the papers on these, there's descriptions and code
on line.

Wednesday, February 11, 1998             Anti-Asian E-Mail Was Hate Crime, Jury Finds               Internet: Ex-UCI student Richard Machado is found to have
violated civil
            rights with threatening messages.             By DAVAN MAHARAJ, Times Staff Writer
                      SANTA ANA--In the nation's first successful
prosecution of
                      a hate crime on the Internet, an expelled university
                  was found guilty Tuesday of violating the civil rights of
                  students at UC Irvine by sending e-mail threats to kill
them if they
                  didn't leave the school.                        Prosecutors hailed the verdict in the retrial of
                  Richard J. Machado as a victory for federal authorities
seeking to
                  police the Internet to deter hatemongers and racist groups.                        "This verdict shows that high-tech hate is not going
to be
                  tolerated," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael J. Gennaco,
                  prosecuted the case. "A line does have to be drawn in the
world of
                  cyberspace. If you cross that line and threaten people,
you are
                  going to be subject to criminal penalties."                        The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for
less than a
                  day before finding Machado guilty of interfering with
students' rights
                  to attend a public university. Jurors deadlocked 9 to 3
in favor of
                  conviction on a second, identical count.                        Machado displayed no emotion when the verdict was read
                  Tuesday afternoon. His first trial ended in a mistrial in
                  with jurors deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal.                        Because his conviction carries a maximum sentence of
one year
                  in prison and he has already served more time than that
in custody,
                  Machado could be set free as early as Friday, when he
appears for
                  sentencing before U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H.
Stotler.                        Gennaco, who heads the civil rights division of the
                  attorney's office in Los Angeles, downplayed Machado's
sentence.                        "What we've taken from this case is a deterrent
value that
                  people can't get on the Internet and send threats to
folks," Gennaco
                  said.                        Gennaco hinted that prosecutors would now be more
likely to
                  step in and prosecute computer users who stalk or
threaten others
                  in cyberspace.                        "We have a number of ongoing investigations regarding
                  allegations of threats on the Internet," Gennaco said.
"Now we have
                  some guidance from 12 people that the government can step
in and
                  enforce laws on the Internet."                        Machado's trial--and retrial--had been seen as a
test case.                        To prosecute Machado, prosecutors turned to civil
rights laws
                  enacted in the 1960s that were designed to prevent
                  from standing in the way of school desegregation.                        Machado violated students' civil rights, prosecutors
                  when he hunched over a computer in UCI's engineering
building on
                  Sept. 20, 1996, and sent an anonymous e-mail message to
                  60 mainly Asian students.                        The message, signed "Asian Hater," warned that all
                  should leave UC Irvine or the sender would "hunt all of
you down
                  and kill your stupid asses."                        "I personally will make it my [life's work] to find
and kill every
                  one of you personally. OK? That's how determined I am. Do
                  hear me?"                        Apparently thinking the first one didn't get
transmitted, Machado
                  sent the same message twice, and school officials quickly
traced the
                  messages to him after they received complaints.                        The e-mail incensed and upset some students,
especially those
                  of Asian descent, who constitute nearly half of UC
Irvine's 17,000
                  students, the highest percentage of any UC school.                        Several students testified that they were petrified
by the e-mail.
                  They armed themselves with pepper spray, refused to go
out alone
                  at night and became suspicious of strangers.                        The defense called other students who testified that
they became
                  angry over the message but later shrugged it off as a bad
joke.                        During the trial, defense lawyers depicted Machado as a
                  disturbed teenager who became distraught and flunked out
of UCI
                  after his eldest brother was murdered in Los Angeles.                        When he sent the threatening e-mail, Machado was no
longer a
                  UCI student, but he was too ashamed to tell his immigrant
                  according to Deputy Federal Public Defender Sylvia
                  Torres-Guillen.                        Machado testified at both trials that one of his
brothers would
                  drive him to UCI each day even after he had been
expelled. There,
                  he passed his days in the computer laboratory, sending and
                  receiving e-mail and surfing the Internet until it was
time to go home.
                       On the day he sent the e-mail, Machado testified, he
was bored
                  and wanted to start a "dialogue" with people who were
signed on to
                  the school's computer network.                        Some attorneys, including Machado's defense team,
                  whether charges should have been filed against the former
student.                        Torres-Guillen even called an expert witness in
                  etiquette, who described Machado's e-mail as "a classic
                  flame"--online lingo for an angry message that, while
annoying, is
                  not meant to be harmful.                        But Gennaco contended that Machado hated Asians because

@_subject: ruling on deceitful domain names 
Seems a wee bit o' infowar is breaking out in the DNS...  Friday February 13 2:17 PM EST  Planned Parenthood wins ruling in domain dispute
 By Jen Sullivan  SAN FRANCISCO (Wired) - In a decision that underscores the thorny and
ongoing issue of brand identity and domain names, the
 U.S. Second Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction issued last
March that prevented the use of the plannedparenthood.com
 domain name for a personal anti-abortion Web site.  U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood ruled that there was "significant
likelihood" that the Web site by Richard Bucci of Syracuse,
 New York, would cause confusion among individuals seeking Planned
Parenthood's actual site, plannedparenthood.org.  The .com version has been placed "on hold" by Network Solutions Inc. (NSI)
and is not accessible to Web browsers.  Planned Parenthood general counsel Eve Paul lauded the decision.  "We aren't a big company that owns factories, we just have our name, and
women all over the country trust our name," Paul said. "We
 can't afford to let someone use it for their own political purposes."  Paul praised the court's finding that Bucci's use of the domain was
misleading. "When you went to that Web site, it said 'Welcome to
 the Planned Parenthood home page,"' said Paul. "It really had a very
negative effect on our ability to reach a great audience out there."
 In addition to espousing anti-abortion views, Bucci's site promoted his
friend's anti-abortion book.  Bucci, an anti-abortion activist who also hosts a local radio program
several times a week called "Catholic Hour," stopped using the
 disputed domain name after the judge issued her preliminary injunction,
but plans to fight the court's decision, taking appeals all the way
 to Supreme Court if possible.  "Do you remember General Patton? We're going to continue to hold Planned
Parenthood by the nose and kick them in the derriere,"
 Bucci said.  Though pleased with the end result, Paul expressed dismay over the slow
speed of the process, first with NSI, and then with the
 ensuing legal action.  "Network Solutions was very slow," said Paul. "If they had been available,
it certainly would have been cheaper.  "Our trademark lawyer wrote them a letter, and they sent back a very
bureaucratic response, saying that we hadn't crossed our T's
 and dotted our I's. We went to court but that turned out to be a longer
process than we had hoped," she said.  Network Solutions' stated policy is that they do not arbitrate in
trademark infringement cases.  "What insanity has gotten into the minds of the people when they think of
domain names and the Internet," said David Graves, director
 of business affairs at NSI. "What mechanism does the Newspaper Association
of America have in place when an advertiser infringes
 on a trademark in an advertisement? They don't have separate mechanisms."  Stanton McCandlish, program director of the Electronic Frontier Federation
(EFF), agreed that trademark infringement is purely a legal
 issue.  "NSI has not been doing a very good job," McCandlish said. "They lose
registrations, things get screwed up. But trademark is a big
 open issue. I don't think that anyone can expect NSI to solve that one.
Lawsuits are inevitable. There is not any way to get to heart of
 the matter."  Paul said Planned Parenthood was in the process of acquiring the
"plannedparenthood.com" domain name.       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

Tuesday February 17 4:16 PM EST Fired programmer zaps old firm
NEWARK, N.J., Feb. 17 (UPI) _ A disgruntled computer programmer dismissed
from a defense contractor has been arraigned for
allegedly zapping his old firm's computer system in retaliation, causing
losses of $10 million. Timothy Lloyd of Wilmington, Del. worked as the computer network programmer
for Omega Engineering Corp., in Bridgeport, N.J. The
company, which has offices in Stamford, Conn., and elsewhere in the world,
produces high-tech measurement and control instruments
used by the U.S. Navy and NASA. Lloyd was fired from Omega on July 10, 1996, after working there for about
11 years. Twenty days after his dismissal he allegedly
activated a computer ``bomb'' that permanently deleted all of the company's
design and production programs, costing the company about
$10 million in sales and contracts. Philadelphia Secret Service head Danny Spriggs says the $10 million in
damages is believed to be one of the most expensive computer
sabotage cases they have ever investigated. Lloyd was also charged with stealing $50,000 in computer equipment from
Omega and taking it home. U.S. District Judge William Walls set bail at $25,000 and scheduled trial
for April 20. If convicted Lloyd faces up to five years for the sabotage count and up to
10 years for the theft count. He could also be ordered to pay
restitution and fines. _-       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

Friday February 20 9:44 AM EST  Chaos may hold key to encryption, researchers say
 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The key to secret communications may lie in chaos,
researchers reported Thursday.  They said they managed to encrypt information by making use of a noisy and
chaotic optical circuit.  Gregory VanWiggeren and Rjarshi Roy of the Georgia Institute of Technology
in Atlanta said they were able to use the chaotic
 fluctuations in a light signal to hide information. Duplicating qualities
of the transmitter allowed them to decode the message.  The value of such tools is growing as electronic commerce becomes more
widespread and businesses try to encode their material
 for secure transactions and communications.  They did not suggest how their scientific experiment, which they reported
in the journal Science, might be given a practical
 application.  VanWiggeren and Roy said they used an erbium-doped fiber ring laser.  "These lasers are particularly well suited for communication purposes
purposes because their lasing wavelengths roughly
 correspond to the minimum-loss wavelength in optical fiber," they wrote.  "A small 10 megahertz message was embedded in the larger chaotic carrier
and transmitted to the receiver system," they added.
 "The receiver has the same non-linearities as the transmitter, allowing it
to unfold the message from the chaos."  Researchers have in the past been able to bury messages in a noisy
electronic circuit but the low bandwidths of the systems make
 them less practical for high-speed communications. Optical circuits have
higher bandwidths.  "These preliminary but intriguing results suggest that chaos-based
applications may be more than just a laboratory curiosity," D. J.
 Gauthier at Duke University wrote in a commentary on the findings.       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

Swiss Claim Israelis Were Spying
                     By IRENE HARNISCHBERG Associated Press Writer
                     BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland said today it
had caught Israel's spy agency in an attempt to bug
                     telephones on the outskirts of the Swiss capital. It
was the third highly publicized Mossad bungle to
                     embarrass the Israeli government in recent months, and
angered Swiss leaders.
                     ``The least Israel can do is apologize quickly,'' said
spokesman Franz Egle of the Swiss Foreign Ministry,
                     which formally protested the alleged bugging attempt
as a violation of national sovereignty.
                     Israel radio said the Israeli agents were trying to
eavesdrop on Iranian diplomats, but Swiss officials denied
                     the report, saying the targets were neither Iranian
nor diplomats.

The telcos don't want to be stuck for the > $500,000,000 cost of installing
the national
surveillience infrastructure.
Reno: Impasse on Digital Wiretaps
                     WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno says an
``impasse'' between the government and telephone companies
                     is delaying installation of new technology that would
enable the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to wiretap into new
                     digital phone lines.
                     Under a 1994 law the government was to pay the phone
companies up to $500 million to develop new computer codes and
                     switches and have them installed by next October.
                     The effort, however, was delayed for at least two
years while the FBI and the phone companies battled with each other over
                     the extent of how much wiretapping capability would be
                     Testifying Thursday before a House appropriations
subcommittee, Reno conceded that meeting law enforcement's future needs
                     will likely cost the phone companies more than $500
million. She said the phone companies have balked at moving forward
                     unless the government agrees to reimburse their costs
above that amount.
                     ``We may be at an impasse,'' she said. ``Simply said,
industry's proposal is that all equipment, services and facilities
installed or
                     deployed as of October 1998 would be deemed in
compliance forever ... unless the government agrees to pay to modify or to
                     upgrade it.''
                     Reno said the Justice Department likely will file a
petition with the Federal Communications Commission next month ``stating
                     that the proposed industry technical solution is
deficient'' and asking the agency to make the phone companies meet law
                     enforcement needs.
                     She said the FBI's electronic surveillance is already
being hampered because of the impasse. But given the six months that the
                     FCC says it would need to decide the case and another
18 months required to install the necessary software and switches,
                     Reno said it may be two years before police agencies'
wiretapping capability fully is restored.
                     Meanwhile, the Justice Department has asked for
another $100 million in next year's budget to reimburse the phone companies.
                     The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Harold Rogers,
R-Ky., told Reno to not expect any more money until the dispute is
                     resolved.
                     ``I not only hope that it's going to happen; I'm going
to make it happen,'' he said, ``or you won't get any money. I don't know
                     how more bluntly I can put it. You dragged your feet
for three years ..., the industry has dragged their feet. I think it's a
                     on both your houses.''

There are several examples of sacrificing liberty for
security in a G7 country in the article below.
Also the justification of "getting in line with other countries"
is used for allowing civilian SIGINT practices previously banned.
Thursday January 8 11:32 AM EST Germany to Restore Surveillance
BONN, Germany (Reuters) - German political leaders agreed Thursday to allow
police to bug
apartments of suspected criminals, restoring a crime-fighting tool banned
since abuses by the secret police
in the Nazi era. Leaders from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition and the
opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) said they had reached a deal allowing police to plant microphones in
private homes of suspected
criminals for the first time since 1945. Both houses of parliament are now expected to quickly pass the long-debated
measure, which police
have argued was needed to better fight organized crime and bring the
country in line with other nations
that allow electronic surveillance. Germany, which reacted to the Gestapo's abuses with some of the Western
world's most extensive civil
liberties laws, has long resisted any relaxation in constitutional
protections that have kept police out of
private homes. Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said the agreement would give police the
necessary tool to fight
organized crime. "This is a decisive step toward more effectively fighting crime," Kanther
said. "We can now keep
surveillance on suspected gangster apartments and we will be able to better
fight money laundering." The opposition SPD, which controls the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat, said it would support
the measure after the government agreed to partial exemptions for some
professional groups such as
priests, attorneys and journalists. Police will be required to obtain advance court permission for any
surveillance. Previously, police were only given rare exemptions to the constitutional
law protecting the private home.
They were allowed to use listening devices or electronic surveillance only
with court permission if there
was concrete evidence that a serious crime was about to take place. Now authorities will have the power to use eavesdropping methods far more
extensively and will also for
the first time be able to bug apartments after a crime has been committed
to obtain evidence. Germany's post-war constitution barred police from electronic surveillance,
telephone taps and
intercepting mail. The bans on telephone taps and mail intercepts were
relaxed in the 1970s amid a wave
of left-wing guerrilla attacks.       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

WHGIII gave you the most conservative answer.  That is, in cryptology, the

A more detailed analysis would say:

* IFF the Norton program were written correctly

then it would be a useful tool for security.

in the non-exportable version.  Keylength-limited versions are worthless

this is feasible once the legal profession gets a clue.. maybe in our

The worst-case situation is a very widely dispersed government denying that kind of common-carrier status.  Imagine congress
signing something giving the UN that power,
then declaring all encrypted-anonymous-archives illegal.  Send a few blue-hats or a cruise missile
to take out the non-signers.  Back home: "who cares, just the UN protecting

a Cayman casino or Togo bank gets toasted.  No one was hurt, and the world
is safe for imbiciles"
In such a scenario you could take other steps.
Steganography helps keep you from being noticed.

Wednesday March 4 4:56 PM EST U.S. authorities launch Internet gambling crackdown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. federal authorities charged 14 people on
Wednesday with running gambling sites on the Internet in violation of
federal laws. In complaints unsealed in Manhattan Federal Court, the U.S. Attorney's
office charged the 14 with using Internet Web sites and telephone lines to
bet on U.S. football, basketball, hockey and baseball games, charging a 10
percent commission per bet. At least some of the defendants were scheduled to appear before a U.S.
magistrate judge later on Wednesday. The defendants were charged with using Internet sites to open bettor
accounts, usually with a minimum deposit of $500, and then accepting bets
on games and game score spreads and maintaining accounts for clients. Client funds were directed to banks or addresses in such offshore locations
as Antigua, Curacao, Costa Rica and Panama, where betting is legal. But the
complaints alleged that the six operations conducted much of their business
within U.S. borders. One defendant, Steven Budin, 27, of SDB Global ( said his
business used the Internet only for marketing, not to take bets. "We don't take wagers over the Internet," he said.       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

@_subject: UPS to market DIGITAL SIGNATURE AUTHENTICATED DIGITAL DOCUMENT DELIVERY, $5 < $x < $10 
UPS ships high-tech security along with packages
By Randolph Court SAN FRANCISCO (Wired) - United Parcel Service stepped into the
secure-electronic-data-transmission business this week, promising to make
online-document delivery as trustworthy and easy to use as a dollar bill
minted by the US Treasury. "We view ourselves as a trusted third party," said Mark Rhoney, vice
president of marketing for electronic commerce at UPS. But can UPS shift its focus from shipping cartons into computer bits? Its
move marks a head-on assault at a growing business now handled by much
smaller, specialized high-tech companies. What UPS will offer by the second
quarter of 1998 is an alternative to existing systems offered by lesser
known entities like Entrust Technologies and Network Associates' PGP
division. Entrust and PGP hawk encryption systems that allow one person to send a
secure data file to someone else with no meddling from any outsiders. UPS's new service, developed in partnerships with Tumbleweed Software and
NetDox, is based on the idea that a supervisor should be involved in the
process to guarantee the integrity of the information being sent. Say a lawyer wants to send a contract worth $3 million, but the recipient
decides to tinker with the numbers and knock the figure down to $2.5
million. The situation dissolves to finger pointing, each side saying they
agreed to something different. With the UPS system, the data that is sent will be digitally fingerprinted
and archived with time stamps and receipts from each party, so there will
be records of whether or not a document has been tampered with. "The document is digitally notarized and legally binding," said NetDox
spokesman Lee Kallman. If there is a finger-pointing situation, UPS will be
able to prove in court exactly what was sent, by whom, who received it, and
when. "That's what you don't get with other encryption systems, and that's the
void UPS wants to fill," said Kallman. The service will play a role not
unlike the role a government plays when it guarantees the value of
currency, Kallman said. UPS will insure the integrity of each document, and the identity of both
sender and receiver, for up to $100,000. The system is called UPS Document Exchange, and it will offer two levels of
security - Dossier for the strong stuff and Courier for the milder version. For the most sensitive data, UPS will use a system designed by NetDox that
requires users to download a software client that wraps data - any sort of
digital information, from simple documents to multimedia - in two layers of
encryption, an inner 40-bit layer, and an outer 128-bit layer. The data is sent to a UPS server where it is unwrapped, and a digital
fingerprint is taken and stored; then it is re-wrapped and sent to its
destination, where the recipient opens it with the NetDox client software. For less-critical data packages, UPS will use a system designed by
Tumbleweed that encrypts data with a varying number of bits to accommodate
the different encryption levels supported by browsers in different countries. The encrypted data is then sent to a UPS server, where it is stored at a
128-bit encryption level. The server sends an email message to the
recipient telling him or her the Web address where the data resides and how
it can be accessed via browser with RSA encryption. --- UPS has been close-mouthed on the question of price, saying only that
delivery will be more expensive than a 32-cent stamp and cheaper than a
traditional overnight delivery. NetDox has been charging $5.35 for domestic transactions and $10.70 for
international data exchanges, according to Kallman. But it hasn't had much
competition. If the UPS service proves viable and other competitors emerge,
prices could drop precipitously, Kallman said. News of the UPS service was greeted warmly in some corners of the
encryption industry, and skeptically in others. "We're very excited to hear that a large company like UPS is rolling out a
broad-based service like this," said Gina Klein Jorasch, director of
enterprise marketing at VeriSign. The company provides digital
certificates, which act like identity cards tying a user's identity to a
public key that enables the encryption process. --- VeriSign has reason to be hopeful, though. Software clients like the ones
provided by NetDox and Tumbleweed require digital certificates, just like
those provided by VeriSign. "A deal between VeriSign and UPS is very conceivable," Jorasch said. Jeff Harell, the product manager for PGP products at computer security
giant Network Associates, quarreled with the fundamental idea of involving
outsiders in the data transmission process. "Why would a corporate customer want to go to third-party systems?" Harell
asked. "A lot of companies don't want to involve a third party that they
are required to trust." Many companies view their data as too important to
risk exposing to a system with so many junctions and exchange points. PGP is a proprietary system. Users sending and receiving data must both
have PGP, and their keys can only be provided and verified by PGP. All of this is new in the traditional package delivery industry, but not
unexpected. "Now that the Web has become so ubiquitous, this strikes me as something
that UPS and the other delivery companies needed to do," said Rita Knox, an
industry analyst with the Gartner Group. "This is a pretty compelling service," Knox added. "It's available 24/7 and
it's virtually instantaneous." Federal Express, after a failed attempt to introduce an electronic service
in the early 1980s, ended up setting a standard in the industry in 1995
when it launched a self-service ordering and tracking system on the Web. Similar services have since been adopted by UPS and Airborne Express, among
other competitors. Analysts are looking ahead to the possibility of UPS's
online delivery service becoming an industry must-have if it proves
successful. "I definitely anticipate another domino effect if UPS has any success with
this at all," said Michael Sullivan-Trainer of International Data Corp.
"All it takes is one competitor to introduce a new software innovation and
it changes industry dynamics."       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

Given that this bill passed 414-1, it'll likely be US law soon.
Does this mean that law enforcement will now need a judicial wiretap order
to go scanning for evidence to get a warrant?
 Friday March 6 10:33 AM EST  House Passes Wireless Privacy Bill
 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a bid to protect privacy for cellphone or
digital calls, the House Thursday voted
 414-1 to make intercepting such phone conversations illegal.  The Wireless Privacy Enhancement Act makes clear that the act of
interception -- whether or not the call is later
 divulged or disseminated in any way -- is against the law.  It bans modification of scanners that are now on the market that can
easily pick up calls made on cell phones, and
 prevents a market for new scanners capable of intercepting digital
communications.  The bill, which the Senate has not yet acted on, increases penalties for
intercepting or divulging private
 communications, making them subject to a $2,000 fine and six months in
jail. Earlier laws had not treated such
 interceptions as serious offenses if they were not used for financial gain.  Although the bill had broad bipartisan support, it was a particular
favorite of Republicans, who were furious after a
 December 1996 cellphone conversation involving House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and fellow Republican leaders
 was taped by a Florida couple. House Republicans have alleged that
Washington Democratic Rep. Jim
 McDermott then leaked it.  McDermott -- who voted for the wireless privacy act -- has not publicly
commented on those allegations.  Ohio Republican Rep. John Boehner, who was using a cellphone in his wife's
car in that conversation with
 Gingrich, enthusiastically backed the bill. "Our message should be plain
and simple," he said. "If you violate
 someone's privacy, you are not creating idle mischief, you are breaking
the law and of the land and you will be
 brought to justice."  Roughly 50 million Americans use some kind of new mobile electronic
communications services, according to the
 bill's sponsors.  The sole vote against the bill came from Ron Paul, a Texas Republican. He
was not immediately available for
 comment.       David Honig                   Orbit Technology

                     After consulting with his proctologist -- and hearing
an appeal in favor of neutering from
                     actress Doris Day -- First Lady Hillary Clinton has
decided on the procedure for the President.
                     But the reluctant First Lady reserved the right to
change her mind. In announcing
                     Hillary's decision Tuesday, White House spokesman
Barry Toiv said Mrs. Clinton
                     was ``inclined'' to allow the procedure.
                     The National Organization of Women, the nation's
largest women's rights
                     group, applauded the First Lady's decision, saying she
was doing the right thing.
                     ``Neutering or spaying politicians is one of the most
important acts a
                     responsible society can take,'' said Martha Armstrong,
a society vice
                     president. ``It promotes better physical and
behavioral health,
                     and it helps to address the ubiquitous sexual
misconduct crises.''
                     Hillary set no immediate date for putting her husband
under the knife, leaving some to
                     wonder whether the 50 year old former Arkansas
governor has been told of
                     his fate.
                     ``Bill's a little too young to understand,'' Toiv said.
                     Indeed, the President seemed blissfully unaware of any
pending surgery as he played
                     fetch with Buddy, the first dog, on the South Lawn
with a green tennis ball Tuesday.
                     White House press secretary Mike McCurry said today
the procedure was ``not
                     likely anytime soon given the dispositions and pending
                     Toiv said Mrs. Clinton's decision was driven by
concerns for her husband's health. She
                     denied that it was motivated by the encounters Bill
has had with Socks the
                     family cat and various White House staff and interns.
                     Dr. Jacqueline Suarez, a proctologist with the
Alexandria (Va.) Army Hospital,
                     said neutering can help curb politicians' aggression
toward other politicians and tendency
                     to fornicate in unwelcome places.
                     ``Although, if we have people questioning if they
should or shouldn't, those health
                     reasons are good reasons to neuter as well, so we'll
use them as part of the case
                     for neutering,'' Suarez said.
                     Miss Day, president of the Doris Day Humanitarian
League, sent Clinton a letter in
                     December expressing concern that the nation would
suffer if he
                     were left intact. Among them was a risk of impeachment
in addition to problems with urination.
                     In January, McCurry said there were no plans to neuter
the President, who had moved
                     into the White House in 1993.
                     However, Clinton physician Connie Mariano has now told
Miss Day in a letter
                     that Mrs. Clinton had decided to neuter the president
on the advice of White House advisor
                     James Carville.
                     Armstrong said that politicians need not worry about
losing their procreative abilities.

ego.  Its all drive for power.

Mexican wiretapping scandal places
 political reforms in doubt
March 26, 1998
 By Mark Stevenson, Associated Press
 MEXICO CITY (AP) ï¿½ When members of
 an opposition party burst into a secret
 government wiretapping station this
 month, they did more than reveal a
 political scandal: They exposed some of
 the deepest secrets of common citizens
 in the coastal city of Campeche.  The wiretapping, apparently orchestrated
 by the state government to get
 information on opposition groups, has
 spawned a scandal that reaches into at
 least four other states. In most cases,
 opposition politicians were the targets.  But nowhere has the damage been as
 great as in Campeche, where a powerful eavesdropping system set
 up in a private home had the capacity to tap virtually all phones in
 the southern city of 200,000 people ï¿½ and record some of their
 darkest lies and infidelities.  "We stood there in shock, in rage, impotence, as we heard
 recordings and read transcripts of our telephone conversations,''
 said Layda Sansores, a senator for the leftist opposition Democratic
 Revolution Party who discovered the surveillance center on a tip.
 "There are difficult moments over the course of seven years, things
 you don't want to remember.''  "We heard a tape of one telephone call in which a man said he was
 with another man's wife. The wife was there in the room with us,
 listening,'' Sansores said at a news conference Wednesday.  A local journalist present during the March 3 raid on the
 surveillance center was quoted in one wiretap transcript as denying
 accusations of rape, noting he `just had fun with' an unidentified
 woman. "We haven't seen him in public since,'' Sansores said.  The taping in the city on the Gulf of Mexico, which used
 sophisticated computer equipment supplied by an Israeli firm,
 apparently began in 1991. Three men caught operating the bank of
 computers and phone switches have been arrested and charged with
 espionage and criminal association. Two had worked at some point
 for state police.  "We are a small family in Campeche, and this hurts our very
 fabric,'' Sansores said.  Documents uncovered by Sansores in the tiny, computerized
 wiretapping center ï¿½ including dozens of tapes and transcripts of
 her own conversations "and those of everyone around me, nieces,
 sisters, my parents'' ï¿½ suggest the eavesdropping was paid for by
 the Campeche state government.  The current government, which took office in late 1997, has
 blamed the wiretapping on a previous state governor and said the
 current governor didn't know about it.  Experts and politicians disagree on whether Mexico is experiencing
 a surge in wiretappings and surveillance, at a time when opposition
 groups are threatening the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's
 69-year uninterrupted grip on power.  Sansores claims that there are up to 22 of the eavesdropping
 stations around the country, and mentioned four other states where
 her supporters or party colleagues believe they have evidence of
 such surveillance.  On March 18, authorities seized a network of phone-tapping
 equipment and secret cameras in Monterrey that reportedly had
 been rented by politicians and businessmen in the northern city.  Several weeks earlier, a top official in the Mexico City government
 and also from the Democratic Revolution Party ï¿½ the first
 opposition party ever to govern the capital ï¿½ said she found two
 tiny surveillance cameras in her office.  "There is a new way of doing things when a new group comes to
 power,'' said Joel Estudillo, an analyst at the Mexican Institute of
 Political Studies. "Politicians say, `We have to find out what these
 people have done''' in the past.  In a closed political circle like that which has dominated Mexico for
 most of the century, secrets like past corruption are often known
 but seldom publicized until a grudge or a competition makes such
 information a valuable weapon, Estudillo said.  "Those kinds of understandings and internal arrangements have so
 far prevented espionage from becoming a big problem.''       David Honig                   Orbit Technology
