Hi, Kurt
I don't want to get up into darkness of long, empty and lonely cool days. I can't be happy to something if I don't have my soul mate, who will understand me...I want to change my life and let love to come into it. I looked here at search of a good man, my destiny...And I found you! Give me a chance to come into your life and to bring into your heart true love  We are masters of our destiny and we create it. I will wait for your letter with hopes and dreams Sincerely yourth
Julia P.
