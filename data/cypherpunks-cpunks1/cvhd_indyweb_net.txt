@_subject: Dr. Vulis is not on cypherpunks any more 
Well put!  I tired a long time ago of Dr. Vulis and several others on this
list.  Rather than bitch about it or resort to the same big brother
gestapo-censor bullshit we profess to abhor I simply utilized the extensive
filtering capability of Eudora.
I don't need "big brother" or big "cypherpunk" censoring my mail for me.
We have become what we fear the most.  How prophetic and pathetic.
I agree.... a very BIG mistake, indeed....

As the smoke from the first rounds of cyber-gunfire of the Gilmore vs
Vulius shootout were wafting thru C-space several of us were bemoaning the
fact that the entire issue hadn't been handled thru creative filtering on
the part of list members as opposed to the heavy-handed "Big-Bro'ish" plug
pulling by Mr. Gilmore.  The "net-loon noise" level increase was
predictable.  Like you I will continue to perform creative filtering in
order to extract the 4 out of 240 messages worth reading in any given 48
hour period. cvhd

Yes,  but how "safe" is a 256-bit key with blowfish?  Would it withstand
the efforts of big bro' ?

Everyone should keep in mind that John McAfee very well knows on which side
of his bread it is buttered--  McAfee has made his fortune on the
site-licenses for government use of his anti-virus product.  U.S. Customs
alone liceneses 17,000+ copies.  Is anyone kidding themselves about which
side of GAK and Key Escrow McAfee will come down on?  I have never bought
into any of the conspiranauts BS about PGP backdoors as long as PZ was
involved with it but I will certainly assume it is to be a "given" with PGP
in the hands of McAfee.
