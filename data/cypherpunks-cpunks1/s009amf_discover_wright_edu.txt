@_subject: New Threat on the Horizon: Software Key Escrow 
I was just reading through my mail when it hit me. If the NSA and the FBI want to put their software based key-escrow systems into software like Chicago, why don't we create pamphlets to send out to businesses and the people of the United States. In the pamphlet, there is a little glossary for some of the terms and acronyms used and explanation of the Govt. would like to do with Clipper Chip and YOUR phones and computers. Or we could try another route. Most radio stations and TV stations give groups free air time for public service anouncements. We could create videos about what we are talking about to make the public aware....

Here's another possibility.. We put out the word that we don't buy Chicago or any somftware that has SKE built in. KEep your old stuff or make your own operating system. I think most of the computer programmers could on joint effort create something better than what is on the market We live in a democracy. We should be telling those assholes in Washington DC how we want the country run, not them telling us that we need NIST. Who are they representing anyway???

Who is writing or doing this crap!!!! This is ludicrous... It's brainwashing and it teaches nothing but ignorance... If you want your cchildren to learn things you expose them to everything, but you guide them through it. If you can't do that, you will ultimately fail as a parent. Why hire someone to tell your kids what they should be reading. Soon people will be banning books like Huck Finn, The Crucible, Grapes of Wrath, and many others through this method of CES... THE FUTURE OF TOMORROW WILL BE DOOMED IF THIS THING TAKEN SERIOUSLY FOR USAGE!!!!

@_subject: Clipper vs. PGP 
Since I consider myself new to this whole topic, even though I have read several articles about PGP and CLIPPER, I wanted to get some more info and understanding for my senior seminar next May....  Does anyone have any opinions on what would happen if the Clipper Chip and its associates were all implemented and the general public swallowed on it?? Would we as knowledgeable computer people become outlaws??? Would be it like 1984?? Would our computer illiterate neighbors try and catch us??? And going the complete opposite direction (a full 180). If the public was able to obtain PGP as easily as we are and they would use it for everything, would that lead to the overthrowing of the government and therefore cause anarchy, due to the fact the governmnet would be helpless in knowing what everyone is doing contrary to the CIA, FBI, etc. being able to read everything we write and say through their current illegal I'm just looking to get a complete picture. At this moment I would go with PGP, but I still see a lot of problems with being on either side. They seem so extreme...

@_subject: Modems that variate speed 
I want a pose something for everyone as a new technology. I have no idea if it has been dreamed up before or if it's possible to do...  Here goes:
Most people communicate by modems if they're accessing the internet from home unless they're rich or just have the right connections (no pun intended). Anyway, could one create a new line of modems that could effectively and efficiently variate modem speeds to disuade people from trying to pick up any modem transmissions by say a local telephone company inorder to keep them from synchronzing data speeds. I know modems sometimes lose some speed, but for the most part they transmit at stable rates.. Am I completely paranoid about this or am I just going off the wall???    I was just reading this article about Telco Snooping that my friend forwarded to me off the NirvanNet...
I'll put it up here if no one has seen it...

Sorry about forwarding this long message but I thought it would be something interesting to read. I have no idea if anyone has seen this before.. But this so you know what is currently happening now.
FYI, who ever made this post is not known at this time. Jeremy Cooper sent it to me and he must have found it on a mailing list for his class. The person who found it got it off the NirvanaNet. I e-mailed him and he thought it was joke. I then looked a bit closer and found that the earliest forwarder of this Chuck Zeps, who posted it on the USENET... Anyway the message he sent me is at the end of this message. If anyone has any ideas or comments about it, please send them. There are BBS numbers from the mailer taglines used by local BBSes. I'm sure if I give one of them a call I can figure out who wrote it originally....
Happy reading!!!

Aaron, the "telco" post was a repost of data I got from an import of
stuff from the Atlanta area. I regretfuly removed the header data and
most people thought *I* wrote it when I reposted it. It was posted to
another bbs down there ( data for that one is just above my .sig if you
look ).
The post was interesting as the methods used are substancially correct
and this type of thing does occur up here. I dunno about banks of
monitors for *everything* in real-time, but much targeted traffic can be
viewed that way ( HP data monitors hooked to archival taping decks).
You might call the BBS listed and enquire further if curious ...
                                     Regards, Chuck

Sandy,  When I saw that commercial for the remote control deal with the minivan and that nice big luxury car I thought about someone being able to figurethe frequency and be able to open that door and start the engine. Makes you think about getting one of those systems for your car. And, I'm sure if someone can come up with a way to encrypt those cars, they could make some money. The only thing is you have to hope the person who makes it doesn't put a back door in the crypto and that car manufacturers won't try and do the Clipper Stunt themselves (ie. they put in a back door)...

In theory this would be nice, but it just takes a gun to someone's head to say hand it over... Would you risk your life for other people... And once they kill you, it's a matter of searching through the records for it. It's not that safe. I rather my private key not be in escrow at all...

What is the difference if a big company subjects its employees to a key-escrow system or if the government does it with the people. If you think about it, the government could coerce the company into reading through information being passed back and forth....

@_subject: A possible solution 
I was sitting down and thinking about the problem of responsibily of using non-escrowed public key cryptography. Well here is a possible answer. Law enforcement agents have several different methods of finding out about crimes that might happen. And this means they wouldn't be allowed to tap phone lines or use key-escrowed systems like Clipper. Then people who do use non-escrowed public key cryptography for illegal actions would have problems. If they are caught by other means such as tips from anonymous sources and are then caught doing something illegal and they are also using non-escrowed public key cryptography to commit these
illegal acts, then the fines and jail time should be increased. This reasoning is based on the fact that we need to be more responsible with technology. Therefore, the government would allow us to go on about our business using non-escrowed key systems, but if misused by the public there would be harsher punishments to the misusing individual. There are plenty of informants out there who can help the law enforcement agencies. We use public key crypt such as PGP. They won't be able to read it, but if there is misuse and the peron is convicted of a crime and is using PGP or some other non-escrowed system to commit the crimes he was convicted of, it's more trouble for him. TO me this is the best solution and it's the only thing I would allow. The government cannot be allowed to tap our phone lines the way they would like to using CLipper or SKE or some other type of system. We need to keep our rights but we need to still make it known that PGP is not meant for corruption and illegal use. IT's meant for private conversation in it due time.
I need feedback desperately on this idea. I am incorporating this idea into a two page paper called Dealing with Technology in the Future. I want this to be part of the solution. But I would like to know what others feel about this idea.

The use of cryptography makes it virtually impossible to know anything.
If everyone used to PGP to communicate. I mean everybody in the whole entire world. There would be no possible way to ever know what is going on. OKay. WE could do that, but guess what. You might as well get your self your own arsenal of weapons because if you can't trust the govt. you're going to be only trusting yourself. IF that's what ya want, do it. But I want to live in a world where I can at least step outside and breathe in the fresh air..

Ok. You all have basically defeated the stiffer fines issue.
The one issue remaining is do we want to live a life of anarchy. Do we want to live in total isolation? Do we want to be completely paranoid and be always looking over our shoulder? You tell me how we solve that problem. I for one do not want to touch "1984" territory, but I don't want to live in an anarchy either.
