Lessig's article is pretty powerful.
I think it's amazing that you can kill someone and get out in less than a decade, but if you "steal" Intellectual Property (without even  distributing it) you can get a life sentence.
Such things point to Corporations being first-class persons and us  flesh-and-blood people are at best second-class.
