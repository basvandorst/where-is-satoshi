I personally find the privacy implications of EDRs rather unsettling. This story doesn't change that one bit. However, in this particular case, I don't think what the EDR said really matters. The three paragraphs from the story say a lot about what happened here:
The *defense* attorney said his client was going 30 mph over the limit (60 mph in a 30 mph zone)! That is a grossly inappropriate speed in a residential area. Here in Texas, a ticket for 55 mph in a 30 mph zone cannot be dismissed with DSC. Not sure how the law works in Florida but I would be surprised if it was that dissimilar.
Let's assume for the moment the prosecution's accident invesitigator is totally full of bovine excrement, and that all manner of gremlins snuck into the EDR thus causing it to record a grossly inaccurate peak speed, and thus, the only version of the story we can give full credibility to is the defense's version. If I were on that jury, I'd still vote for a conviction. Matos is a scofflaw and deserves exactly what he is

I can concur with this, though it wouldn't surprise me if lying on
police reports has increased since then.
He may not have a choice. There are three choices for intracity travel
in the US: air, automobile (I'm lumping intracity buses in with personal
cars here for a reason that will be obvious later), and train. First, let's look at automobile travel, which includes buses. There is
one major intracity bus company left and that's Greyhound. They tend to
be cheap, and thus attract people who can't afford to fly. The only
advantage over driving your own car, is you don't have to worry about
doing the driving yourself ("Go Greyhound and leave the driving to us"
if you remember the old commercials). Generally, automobile travel is
nearly unworkable if you're going farther than, say, a 10-hour drive or
about 500 miles.
As for Amtrak (the last passenger rail line left), well, that may be
just as bad in most cases. I have heard that the government subsidies of
Amtrak are being dropped to lower and lower levels, and as such they are
not making enough money to operate at acceptable standards to most of
us. Read misc.transport.rail sometime and you will see what I mean.
Also, you don't get there that much faster than with automobile travel,
and I think it may actually cost more.
I wouldn't speak so ill of the ACLU. Groups like the ACLU are just about
the last thing standing between what's left of our democracy and an
outright dictatorship.
White people aren't even necessarily the "majority" anymore.
This is downright insensitive. (Mr. Monahan, if you actually get to read
this, Terranson does *not* represent the views of all of us in the

you when your wife gets pregnant and something similar happens to you.
And again, he likely didn't continue to fly because he wanted to. See

Agreed, in part. I don't think it'll fly too well if any hardware
manufacturer builds in TCPA such that only a Microsoft-certified OS will
run on it, for one, it's a bad idea to piss off the geeks (and certainly
there's a higher geek to ordinary user ratio in the free software
world), and also this would be a great way for Microsoft to piss off
even the current (far-right Republican) administration. I would expect
the setting to disable the TCPA chip to be present in new hardware for
as long as TCPA lasts, and indeed, there may be cases where even an
ordinary user would want to disable the TCPA chip.
I personally don't trust Microsoft at all. They had their chance to keep
my trust, and they blew it, big time.

If creating an MP3 file is not copying, then making an analog cassette

This reminds me of something else: to a computer, playing is simply a
form of copying, the output is simply a video card and/or sound card.
Isn't this is, in fact, what makes computers so powerful, that they
simply obey instructions without asking questions? Isn't this why every
attempt to block "unauthorized" copying has failed in the end, because
the reality is that if it can be played, it can be copied, because
playing *is* copying from the point of view of the computer programs?

A Houston (TX, USA) public library? Could be next to impossible, as well
as excellent cause for revocation of your library card and possible

All you get access to as a library card holder is a Web browser (or

The computers at the Houston libraries don't allow access to the USB
ports from what I have seen, and in order to get access to anything
besides a Web browser you would probably need to reboot the machine and
you then have maybe 15-20 minutes before a librarian notices you. Now,
the Harris County libraries might be different; I have not gone to one.
