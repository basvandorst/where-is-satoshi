At a recent the-net-is-hot-and-we-want-in show I appear to have

They had left a "search the net" link on their pages (pointing to
Lycos or Info Seek - I don't remember which), and I used it to
locate one of my pages which has a "type the URL" field (it issues
a redirrect).
I guess they didn't realise that if they give you a "global" search
box you can get anywhere as long as you remember enough of the text
on the page...

He may or may not be right that end-to-end encryption is important, but:
(a) Netscape has documented exactly how SSL should work, and
(b) Microsoft can licence RC4 and RSA from PKP just as well as
Netscape can.
In addition it is far from clear that SSL will be the winning end-to-end encryption in the web world ('tho it looks that way
at the moment - a few well publicised attacks - say one agenst
the 40bit keys, and say a man-in-the-middle may make S-HTTP, or
PGP-HTTP look alot better then SSL to the public - or it may not).

It is fairly simple to cut & paste 10 values ~25 times, it is harder
to write and verify code to initilize the array.
More intresting is that Gx[i % 10] is faster then a stright index
on many systems (anything you could expect cache line conflicts or
cache capacity overfills on, and supports a modulis signifigantly
faster then the first few parts of the memory hierachy).

I don't know what can be done here other then encuraging the user

Don't I need to know what goes into the IV?  I can't just stick
random stuff in it - I need to stick something that is a function
of the passphrase into it (or make the user remember something
my program spits out).
Oh, I was going to do a MD5 of half of the passphrase to get one
key pair, then MD5 the other half to get another key, and that
left about 64 bits to play with....
Don't I need to reproduce the same IV during the decryption?
Hmmmm, so I should put the salt in the clear at the start of the file?
This looks like an intresting idea.

three times slower) in tripple DES mode.  I beleve that's what
UUNET uses in their LanGuardian product.  I have the spec sheet in

more then fast enough to encrypt voice traffic.

they may not have been a comercial product.  Sorry I don't have part

hiigh speed, unfortunitly I don't recall the speed - something like
a DS0's worth (or it may have as low as 32Kbits/sec worth) - less then a T1.

@_subject: Liability for Key Cracking via Java scripts? 
Tim May's post got me thinking...
Assume that Java became "trusted" by most people on the Internet.
(Java is a safe subset of the Oak language, it can be intrpereted,
or compiled.  One of the proposed uses is to embed it in Web
browsers.  The compiled form is roughly as fast as C++ code.)
Assume that there is some sort of secure low transaction cost fund tranfer system is available.
I beleve that's all the technology you need for selling idle CPU
cycles.  Would it take off?  Raytracing (and other types of rendering)
and key cracking are the only two uses I can think of off the top
of my head (you need a relitavly low amount of communication between
processes, the ability to survive some results never coming back
(and coming back out-of-order), and preferabbly the script and data
it works on need to be smallish)
Then I thought some more...  if Java really does get embeded in web
browsers (Netscape announced that they were going to do it... it is
somewhere on their press release page), what's to prevent the Java
anamited icon widget things from doing more then just animating the
dancing stick figure?  What if it cracks keys while dancing?  I think
Java "applets" are allowed to make some form of IP connections, if
they are what's the liability for _inadvertant_ key cracking?

Across a net it should be hard.  On the same CPU it may be easy.  Some
CPUs with hardware branch prediction keep track of how many branches were
correctly and incorrectly predected.  These registers are not allways
protected, and not allways "made virtual" by the OS.
If your spin wait is of the form:
LOAD  R1
DEC R1
BNE L1
(a.k.a "for(i = big_number; i--;) { }")
Then the "number of correctly predicted branches" will go up by approximatly
(in all honesty the only CPU I am sure "allows" normal user programs to
see the performance registers is the AMD29xxx series, and that is only
if the OS sets the right bit in the register protection mask.  I know
the P6 has such performance registers, but don't know if they are protected,
and I think the P5 has them, but again I don't know if they are protected.
I think some of the Alpha's have them, but seem to remember them being
protected (and I use to think it was a dumb idea...))

In message , root w
Well it seems to assume that it only needs to write 1024 bytes past the
end of the file.  You either don't need to write any bytes at all past the end, or you need to write one "block" past the end (normally 8K,
but it varies), you can use fsstat(2) on many systems to find the block
size for a filesystem.
Secondly you need to flush the data out to the file (use fflush(3), and
fsync(2) if available, otheruse call sync(2) *twice*).  If you don't some
small set of Unix systems may notice that you are writing to a file that
no longer exists, and not do the writes at all.
Thirdly you should make several passes over the file, writing diffrent
patterns on each pass (and remember the flush & sync after each pass -
while it is uncommon for Unix systems to supres writes to unlinked files
it is extreamly common for them to detect multiple writes to the same part
of a file, and only do the last one).
Forth - and this is the kicker - there is no gaurentee that the filesystem
itself won't keep a copy of the old data for some reason.  Three examples:
 * a compressed filesystem may write the new data elsewhere because it
 compresses diffrently from the old data - you should be able to defeat
 this by filling the disk several times with random paterns
 * the log structured filesystem (LFS) *will* write the new data elsewhere,
 and the space the old data is on will not be overwritten untill the
 cleaner comes and examines the part of the disk it is on - again filling the
 disk several times with random patterns should cause an overwrite
 * NetApp's NFS appliance ("the toaster") can (and normally is) configured
 to take "snapshots" of the filesystem at various times, this makes the
 blocks the file is currently on read-only, and any ovewrites will merely
 allocate new space.  The old copy of the file will be readable for some
 peroid of time (frequently up to a week) under a diffrent name - here you
 will be unable to fill the disk (unless you are the NetApp admin - then
 you can delete the appropriate snapshots and fill the disk...)
While we are at it you probbably want to use stat(2) to find the length
of the file, and you can get far more I/O if you allocate a sizeable
chunk of memory (say 1K, or 8K) and use writev(2) to shove multiple copies
of it out per syscall...    and some indenting on the code would make
it more readable (and simpler for you to write as well).
I don't know of a real un-rm.  In "the old days" there was a fsdb (filesystem
debugger) that could be used to alter the filesystem at a low level.  If
you knew enough you could "un-rm" a file.  It had to be a very valuable
file to be worth it!).  At some sites they alias rm to do something like
"mv $1 .$1.deleted", making an un-rm is left as an exercize for the
intrested reader.

I would agree that they know about many catastrophic bugs, perhapse
even most, perhapse not.  That doesn't mean they have been fixed.
I have been involved in a fair number of beta test programs (as a
tester for the compony relasing the product, as a programmer for
the compony relasing the product, and as a user recieveing the
product to be tested).  Most had catastrophic bugs (varying from
crashing for programs written in C, to kicking you out of the run
time enviroment for programs witten in APL) that were known about
when the product was shipped to testers.  The others we had absoultly
no doubt that such bugs would be found by testers.
Perhapse Netscape is diffrent, but I don't see why they would be.
Certinally I can make Netscape 2.0b1 crash, and I doubt people at
Netscape were foolish enough to think that it wouldn't.
Yes the principal reason for having a Beta is to find bugs you don't
know about.  That does *not* mean you need to remove all known bugs
before you start the Beta ('tho it does cut down on the number of
duplicate reports - many testers fail to read the known bug list).
There are also some less noble reasons to have a Beta (like the
PERT chart says the Beta starts October 8th or the project will
start to slip, and many more).  There is no real evidence that
this applys to Netscape so I won't go into them.

Yes, and this would be diffrent from my point of view in what way?

reporters have their own set of thought processes and may decide this
is bad for some reason.  Or not.
Ok, go ahead.
(I'm not sure they have ever gone out and said the Beta software isn't
secure.  Hopefully people realise that beta code doesn't allways do
everything it hopes to, and will not assume it is secure just because
it has a goal of being secure.)

When /dev/random doesn't have "enough" enthropy left does reading

blocking, as the non-blocking behavur is not really all that useful.
Either can simulate the other, but I think it comes down to:
non-blocking worst-case:
 a program calls /dev/random, doesn't get randomness, ignores
 error code, poorly protects some valuable thing, as a result
 the valuable thing gets stolen.
blocking worst-case:
 a program calls /dev/random, waits a long time to get random numbers,
 user curses the slow machine/program, valuable thing gets sent late,
 but is not stolen.
non-blocking best-case failure:
 a program calls /dev/random, doesn't get randomness, informs smart
 user, who finds the bad guy sucking all bits from /dev/random,
 has them ejected from system.
blocking best-case failure:
 same as worst-case (i.e. the worst-case is lots better, the best-case
 is worse).  This can be transformed to the non-blocking best-case  failure by clever programming (threads, or fork, or sigalarm), the
 people who do this are far more likely to actually try to issue a

This will allow you to gennerate your own cookies rather then
relying on MIT.  (I actually have C code to set the cookie dirrectly,
since I don't really care to have it visable to ps, even breifly).
Unfortunitly X will blat the "secret" out in the clear every time you
make an X connection, so it still isn't very good.

Well, I would susspect that because if your X server isn't "secure" there
isn't much you can do that is.
Other then xterm, most X programs will respond to "synthetic" events
(events gennerated by another programs as opposed to the user), this
means with a little work anyone with access to the X server could
click open the File menu, select "Open URL", type in a URL, press "Open",
click "SaveAs", and so on.
Even if all X clients stoped listening to synthetic events (which would
be a shame - since they are useful in various contexts) X's event
structure allows multiple X cleints to lissten for tthe same events on
the same windows, so a simple program could track all keystrokes and
capature your passwords.
Failing all of that any X client could track ownership of the X selection
(the "cut buffer" normally used to hold text), and when it looks like a
Unix command (implying that you will be pasting it into the command line)
assert ownership of the selection itself and put in "^X^U^H;rm -rf ~/*"
followed by a carrage return.
That's just off the top of my head ('tho I admit I have written two of
the three "exploits" while I was a sysadmin 4 years ago in an effort
to convinse my managers to mandate better security then "xhost +"...).
So saying "Netscape isn't secure when my X server isn't" is alot like
saying "When I leave the front door of my house unlocked my VCR isn't
