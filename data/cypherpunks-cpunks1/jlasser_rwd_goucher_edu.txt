Two other possibilities: (1) It's merely an independently produced cryptosystem disguised as a "leak" to save its creator the trouble of asking experts to analyze it for him/her.  (2) It's a misleading / intentionally "wrong" version of something, "leaked" by a government official of whatever ilk to precipitate a legal investigation of Cypherpunks, remailers, etc.  (ie to show a judge to get wiretaps, etc.)

What if: (assuming trusted remailers, but still worried about traffic analysis of those remailers):
One mailed a message to one remailer. This remailer held onto all messages until some predestined hour or kilobyte size or whatever, and then forwarded ALL its messages to this other remailer, in one packet (.TARred and PGPed separately, say), but NOT IN THE ORDER RECIEVED?
While this wouldn't solve all the problems (to some extent, the sizes of files might be correlated, but this could probably be foiled by other means), wouldn't it at least foil the easy to/from traffic analysis that is (I believe) the greatest threat?

@_subject: def'n of "computer network" 
Bet you 10-1 that "Computer Network" as implemented in the new bill will refer to any computing system that could possibly defend /itself/ through common carrier status.  IE including small non-networked fringe BBSs that attempt to claim "common carrier" status.
And many networks that don't claim common carrier status, too.
The real solution to the crypto-legalization problem is anonymity.  Seeing as I've not checked the bill out yet, nor am I a lawyer, I can't say what the implications for that are.  If there are anti-remailer implications, the solution may be to build tools with "security flaws" (ie remailing capability).  I know that this has been discussed before, but this is the time to implement it.  Obviously, the information about the "security holes" will have to be spread widely, but the flaws will have to be built so deep in the design as to not be removable.
In addition, now is the time to deploy stego, on a massive scale.  How many stego programs have been released for Unix?  Can these be integrated with mailing programs in the same way that PGP has been?
What would be the legal liability of the maintainer of a common-carrier status system that had a guest account which had been (or based on the current legislation) could be used for anonymity/crypto stuff?  If he's liable, does this mean that system administrators are liable for any potential security hole in their system that a random evil internet hacker uses to abuse another system?  Hmmm... Usenet alt.binaries.pictures.barney + stego software + unmaintained 'guest' account on a random system = ???

True, in that sense it's useless.  But if it's PGP'd with a sufficient key, nobody can read it.  If it's from a well-overused guest account, nobody can find who sent it.  If the picture's not preceded with an identification of the intended recipient, and is posted in a public forum, then nobody knows who it's for.  Especially if everyone has to read it in order to find out if it's for them.
If PGP 3.0 has some sort of option to decrypt messages without PGP headers or footers, then the issue ceases to be relevant. Because you've stego'd already random-seeming material.  If the stego program is integrated with PGP properly, you have public key stegonography.
It's possible; just that somebody's gotta write the damned software.  And I'm certainly not capable to do that.  Yet.

Perhaps.  I went to a computer store the other day, and saw almost two dozen different packages for e-Space access, each with different software... 2 or 3 with netscape, 2 or 3 with mosaic, everything else just custom packages, mostly.
And from what I've heard about HotJava (not seen it yet, can't comment strongly) there needs another jump in PC power before it would be useful at the home level.  Part of why we were stuck with DOS for so long is that it was what got the job done when the revolution happened.  For that reason, I agree that HTML/Integrated browser solutions are what we're looking at, and at the same time don't have strong hopes for HotJava, though I would like to see it succeed.
All dogmas are ultimately Bad Things.  But dogma gets stuff done in the short run.  NetScape deserves to be popular; they followed the truth that most PC users like "pretty" better.

Knowledge itself can be seen as a kind of virus. On the psychological
level this perception manifested recently as a panic about "computer
viruses", and more generally about computer hacking -- boundary violations
in cyberspace, so to speak. The government wants access to all computer
cypher-codes in order to control the "Net", the InterNet, which might
otherwise spread everywhere, transmitting secrets, even secrets about
"abuse" and kiddy porn -- as if the Net were a disease, rather than simply
a free exchange of information. America's immune system can't take "too
much knowing" (or whatever T.S. Eliot's lame-ass phrase was); America must
be "protected" from penetration by foreign chaos cabals of evil hackers
(who might look just like you and me) -- borders must be imposed.             ----------------------------------------------

Similarly, if PGP is on a computer which other people may use without my supervision, they can  monitor keystrokes, etc. and PGP is not A chain is only as strong as its weakest link; Alice recognizes this, and makes no claim that PGP itself is the weak link.

Not if you're encrypting a Credit Card transaction to ship physical goods.  In that case, I'm going to certainly want to link a key ID to a physical body (or at least address) if I'm the seller, so as to limit liability as best I can.
While this might not ultimately be important, early adopters of crypto on the net seem in general to be financially interested with an eye to limiting liability. They want linked keys.
There's a public-relations aspect to crypto which most systems not linking name -> key id fail.  This is the step necessary to get it out the door.
Unfortunately, it also appears counter to CP philosophy.
However, if you have optional linking of ID and name, shippers will only ship to keys with such attributes. Because just ID and address, it could be a "hit and run" type attack shipped to a safe maildrop.

Credit card fraud -- ie I've snarfed someone's card number and they haven't figured it out yet.
Cardholder's liability is $50 (I think).  Depending on the situation (if it's a card-is-physically-present transaction or a not-present) the liability falls to either the bank or the merchant.
A "proof of address" is a darn good way to reduce (not prevent, reduce) that sort of fraud.

That's if you're accusing the merchant of fraud. I'm positing someone's using a stolen credit card number.  (Yes, these will still exist for at least a while after e-cash becomes commonplace).  If I'm a merchant, I'm going to really want (if I know it's possible) to ship only to what's been "the address on the card" (or, in reality, in the database under the card's number) so that it's harder (not impossible, harder) for people to defraud me.
No; you're going to steal from your enemies by having them ship things to you without payment.
Note that in an ecash economy, this isn't a problem.  The original post was about the transition between the current economy and a "cypherpunks" economy, during which I suggested that encryption would be used to protect credit card numbers (and be a "proof of identity" -- which I was claiming wouldn't work without ecash (proof of non-fraud payment))

I think Hal and some other Cypherpunks (Me, You, Carl, etc.) are not proceeding from one of the same assumptions.  Specifically, Hal seems to be proceeding from the assumption that the person "on the other end of the line" is in fact a known physical entity who has a meat reputation tied to the name.  I'm proceeding from the assumption that the person on the other end of the line has no specific RL reputation that I'm basing the relationship on, just the online one.
Here's an example:
There's someone on the list, now, apparently, with the name of "Steven Levy."  Hal assumes that, when communicating with that "Steven Levy," one intends to communicate with the fairly-well-known journalist of that name, and thus  certification of RL identity is important.  I assume that, unless there's a specific reason otherwise, I want to have an intellectual conversation (or financial transaction, etc) that isn't predicated on this being "the" Steven Levy.  In that case, certification of RL identity is irrelevant.

It might be described as being for a particular reason (ie supressing evidence), but each of those reasons ultimately boils down to lack of respect.
In addition, were I handing down (or prosecuting) the contempt charges, I'd claim that the statement (even if it was made in public) that the individual didn't know all the keys in the first place was a lie, and that, by repeating the lie, they were purjuring themself.
I am not a lawyer; however, I suspect that neither was the anonymous poster.

Actually, I'm just starting such a project in TCL...
The first phase is as a shell for Matt Blaze's Crypto File System, so it can be run, and changes made, without opening up a shell or dealing with command-line options.
The next phase will be to write (what I beleive to be) the first graphical
PGP shell for X.
While this isn't a seriously cypherpunks-relevant app, as most people running X are capable of dealing with the command line (I am, too, but I don't want to open up a shell every time I load up my encrypted partition), but I'm using it as a jumping-off point.
I don't think TCL is suited to heavy-duty crypto applications, except as an interface. Mostly because it is interpreted, though I'm not sure how "everything is a string" would affect bignums. (And I wouldn't want to write a TCL bignum library...)
It might be possible to write a remailer front-end in TCL, and that might be a near-future project, if the frontend project proves successful. (Which it has, in a sense, because the first phase (though it isn't where I'd want to distribute it far and wide) is done to the point where I can load my CFS partition and disconnect it without opening a shell...
(early Alpha code is available upon request, and suggestions/help/co-writing
 is most certainly welcome...)

For those people who have Netscape / an SSL-enabled web-browser, wouldn't it be useful to have secure web pages that did the following:
(1) An anonymous remailer web page, like the current ones (this one has     the obvious advantage that plaintext doesn't travel to the http server)
(2) A pgp-sending web page (type in key id into field, send message to     address given, encrypted)  This isn't a bad idea for the same reason that
    (1) above is a much better idea.
(3) Ultimately, a server that did (2), through (1).  Being able to send PGP
    encrypted email to a recipient through anonymous remailers, over the web
    with a secure browser might be PGP's "killer app" in one way or another.
How hard would this be to implement? Would it be worth waiting until the PGP 3.0 API is released?

@_subject: Some thoughts on the Chinese Net 
Several people have posted to the list that the Chinese, censored, Internet will fail. Usually, the claim is that the censored network will fail mostly because of technical reasons, namely the inability of the Chinese government to censor everything. The other significant claim made was that the Chinese problem is "behind" the "firewall" leading into the country... Suggestions have been made that RSA is involved with China to implement this censorship.
I would suggest that the Chinese solution to these problems is singular, and simple: the total inability to conduct any transaction anonymously.
How can this occur? It takes two parts; one simple, one somewhat more The simple portion is a national (Chinese) database associating true names with key IDs. These keys will be usable only to sign documents, not to encrypt information, similar to the Federal DSS.
The more complex portion (from my perspective, at any rate) is a modification of the standard TCP/IP protocol, requiring that each packet be signed by its originating user. This would require lots of software modification on the Chinese end, as well as a conversion process at the National firewall. (This is where the censorship takes place; the censors don't filter out unwanted information, they sign acceptable information. They then store a reference to the bit of information with a hash. If the hash checks out, they don't need to re-sign the data. This allows a ramp-up after a while to provide adequate quantities of The real question is who's going to design/implement this protocol? The answer is Western sofware companies which want to do business in China. RSA would obviously be called upon to design the protocol, as well as perhaps provide certain implementations of it. Another likely candidate is Microsoft, whose Windows OS has been declared a National Standard by China. It would hold obvious financial benifits for MS to develop a Chinese TCP/IP protocol for Windows. Any company which wants a monopoly in a country of > 1 billion people could probably get in on this deal.
Now that all information has a recognizable source, dissidents in China can be arrested, and unacceptable information never makes it into the Can anybody say why this can't be implemented? Or why China wouldn't implement it?
This is obviously a worst-case scenario, but one which appears, at least to me, to be technically feasable.
I'd love to hear otherwise.

Well, no.  Or yes and no. Something like Public-Key crypto in general, where the public key isn't enough knowledge to decrypt it.  For example, you could encrypt a session key with RSA.
Well, that's what I want to avoid; I think the issue is that as long as stego is predictable, there's a problem, ie a message to a certain party can be shown to exist, even if it's not readable. This might prove more than ample evidence in certain circumstances.
You shouldn't be able to recover the stego'd message without special knowledge.  This isn't addressed by current software, to my knowledge.

This is _exactly_ where the transnational nature of the Internet becomes successful, when combined with strong crypto. If the sites coming into your machine are encrypted, nobody outside of your system (perhaps only you) know that said newsgroups, websites, etc. are being hit. If the site they originate from is determined to be offshore, they can't stop the site. Probably. Subject, at least, to foreign cooperation or direct CIA/NSA involvement.
The potential for traffic analysis is the danger here. If an "FBI International Data Laundering Expert" testifies in court that said data came from a site known to be frequented solely by so-and-sos, all the strong crypto in the world won't stop the average jury from convicting you.
Carl Ellison (among others, I'm sure) has suggested various means of foiling traffic analysis among a group of trusted conspirators, using a token-ring-like routing scheme. I'm not completely convinced that it's robust enough, but a variation on it is probably adaptable.
The point-to-point nature of the internet is also its achilles heel, as far as traffic analysis is concerned... the troubles faced by traditional cypherpunk remailers, the generalized problem of anonymous message distribution, and such are the current limits of consideration on the list (as far as I'm thinking right now... I may be wrong).  However, the problem of, say, webservers collecting statistics on users, would be moot should it be possible for truly anonymous websurfing (I'm convinced that traditional http proxies have the same flaws as traditional cypherpunk More work needs to be done on untracable, yet at least modestly efficient, truly anonymous routing, even in a system where many of the participants, and perhaps even one of the endpoints, is or is willing to Jon Lasser

Totally different from a DC-Net, as far as I understand DC-Nets (I think I do, but Applied Crypto's in my dorm, and I'm at home, so I can't check)
In this approach, computers are organized in "rings"; each computer in a given ring always has an encrypted packet in circulation.
When the group of packets arrives at a given station, it replaces its current encrypted packet with a new packet; if it doesn't have any new packets to send, it puts up a garbage packet that is indistinguishable from a normal packet. It then scans all the other packets and attempts to decrypt them with its private key. Any it can read, it does; all the packets are forwarded to the next station in the ring.
By the time the next set of packets arrives, all have been replaced; the station is unable to determine either the source or the destination of any given packet. Routing between loops is done by routers, which are computers on multiple loops. Perhaps all machines are on multiple loops and serve as routers.

If someone put up an IRC<->news gateway, with a bot that allowed anyone on channel to read newsgroups, it'd be virtually impossible to censor; one could use a variable channel name to increase the difficulty of censoring it.

services can be used to attempt to drive stock prices higher or lower
through misinformation."  Postings about Iomega escalated to flaming and
physical threats last month, causing Motley Fool to pull some of the more
offensive ones, but critics of online BBSs note Iomega's problems are a
result of the practice of using "screen names" and the lack of verification
of information that's posted.  "You don't know if the person is a Ph.D. or

WAY WRONG NUMBER
  HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A CITY COUNCILMAN PORNED
   JOSHUA QUITTNER    This is a tale about how an online prank grows into an international
   incident. It also goes a long way toward explaining the fear many
   non-Internet people have about this out-of-control thing called
   cyberspace.
   Our story begins on the banks of Lake Erie, in Willowick, Ohio (pop.
   15,469). It is the last Monday night in January, about 9 o'clock. City
   councilman Frank Suponcic is home with his wife Linda when the phone
   rings. Linda answers. "Hi, this is Mike," says the man at the other
   end, politely enough. Linda chats with Mike, figuring he must be a
   constituent. (As Willowick's longest-serving ward councilman, Suponcic
   has lots of voters calling him at home.) After a while, Mike asks for
   Annette. Linda tells him he has the wrong number. Mike apologizes and
   hangs up.
   The phone rings again at 11:30 p.m. And again. And again. Wrong
   numbers until 4:30 a.m. A weary Suponcic wonders what's up and checks
   the Caller-ID logs on his phone. The first call was from British
   Columbia. The next was from Connecticut. There was one from
   Indianapolis and a few from California. Clearly these are not
   constituents. But who are they?
   Suponcic calls the Canadian back--it is now 5:30 a.m. in that time
   zone, and he is only too happy to wake the dude up--and he demands to
   know what is going on. The guy explains, vaguely, that he was merely
   answering an "ad on the Internet. You know, the one about horny
   housewives..."
   So now we have a problem. Suponcic, like a lot of people, has a new
   computer. But like most people, he hardly knows what the Internet is.
   Now, somewhere there's an ad on it. For horny housewives. With his
   home phone number.
   That night, when the next wrong number came in, Suponcic interrogated
   the caller and learned that the councilman's phone number was printed
   at the bottom of some pictures of naked women that had been posted to
   a Usenet newsgroup called alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, which,
   naturally, Suponcic had never heard of. But he had a friend in
   Cleveland who was something of a computer buff. So the next day the
   two of them jacked into Usenet and spent three hours sifting through
   about 7,400 files on alt. binaries.etc.
   Eventually, they found two with Suponcic's phone number. One featured
   a topless brunet wearing only a string of pearls and offering phone
   calls for "as low as 87 [cents] per minute." The other showed a blond
   woman advertising "hot amateur wives ready for you from there [sic]
   own bed." Yikes.
   Over the next week, Suponcic received more than 75 calls a day from
   lusty Netizens. "You just could not make phone calls," says the
   exasperated councilman. "And when you went to bed, you had to take
   your phone off the hook."
   It was the sorcerer's apprentice scenario, and there was no way to
   stop it.
   Suponcic, being a public official, knew his way around the local
   police department, and soon a detective started pounding the Net. By
   tracing the header information on the Usenet postings, the detective
   determined--O.K., this part is murky, we admit--that the messages had
   originated in Ohio, passed through Florida Online, an Internet
   provider in the Sunshine State, and then through anon.penet.fi, a free
   E-mail remailer service based in Finland that allows Internet users to
   post messages anonymously.
   The identity of the poster was, and is, unknown, though Suponcic has
   his suspicions. "It's my personal belief that the root of this is
   political," says the councilman, who had to get an unlisted telephone
   number and whose wife now wants to move.
   On Feb. 6, at Suponcic's urging, the Willowick city council passed a
   resolution asking the state and federal governments to close the
   "loopholes" that allowed anonymous remailers to operate outside the
   authority of U.S. law-enforcement officials. "Once you've achieved one
   of these anonymous identities, you're dangerous, and there's no way
   law enforcement can track it," Suponcic says. "The animal's out of
   control."
   Still not content, Suponcic contacted Steven LaTourette, the U.S.
   Congressman who represents his district. LaTourette's staff suspects
   that the problem lies with Julf Helsingius, the Finn who runs the
   anonymous remailer. They wrote a letter to the Finnish ambassador and
   sent copies to the Secretary of State and the chairman of the House
   Committee on International Relations. The State Department agreed last
   week to look into the complaint.
   But here's a reality check. The Finnish remailer could not have been
   used, since anon.penet.fi no longer transmits binary image files.
   Jerry Russell, who runs Florida Online and who looked into the case,
   says he figures the whole thing was a relatively simple prank called a
   sendmail spoof, in which the prankster posts a message with a phony
   return address. He says the Willowick police never produced a copy of
   the posting for him so that he could unravel the tangle for them.
   Indeed, when the policeman called, "he didn't really understand what
   he was trying to tell me," says Russell. "The average Joe Blow police
   detective doesn't know flip about the Internet."
   Neither does the average public official. And that, friends, is why
   stuff like the Communications Decency Act--the Christian Coalition's
   attempt to remove pornography from the Internet--sails through
   Congress.

Well, I won't say it's impossible.
However, for those of you who are relatively new to the list, Mr. Unicorn has been a regular (and useful) contributor to the list. My belief in this has been unwavering. Excepting, of course, the recent Unicorn/Bell flamefest, which we all get sucked into occasionally.
My opinion of Mr. Bell on the same issue has varied widely; however, he has participated (in recent times) in more flamewars on the list than anyone, including the usual flamers (ie Perry, me, etc.).
It is also interesting to note that Mr. Unicorn talks knowledgably about several fields; Mr. Bell talks about one field, and there are those who would dispute his knowledge about it.
I have had an e-mail correspondence with Mr. Bell that lasted several messages. In it, we were both civil and friendly; I post this now not to take sides in the flamewar, but merely to note that, in my opinion, it is improbable that Black Unicorn is Detweiller, and that, although I missed the origin of this thread, it is likely a suggestion from Mr. Bell or one of his associates, intended to discredit him.
If Mr. Unicorn is indeed Detweiller, it is in the mold of Vlad Z. Nuri, who (while almost certainly Detweiller) has produced useful contributions on the list, while refraining from acting out.
It is also worth noting that the original Detweiller, in a sense, played De Sade to Tim May's Rousseau, in that he used an unorthodox, but effective, critical technique. (This is, in fact, one reading of De Sade's "pornography" -- an interesting counterexample to what was trumpeted on _Both_ sides of the recent Firing Line debate: that pornography or obscenity is, whether or not protected, devoid of any intellectual content.)

Disagree strongly. The net is a LARGE number of SMALL communities. This is why spammers are so offensive: they trespass and violate boundries. This is why killfiles were invented. You ask about people who don't know about killfiles.  Teach them. This requires no formal organization.
Yes.  If there was state control of the Internet, there probably wouldn't be any anonymous remailers. And the Cyberangels would go away.
Very few things are inevitable; that's a very strong word. The Cypherpunk Agenda is to provide exactly those tools which make this "inevitable" thing absolutely impossible.
Disagree modestly.
Have you taken a good hard _honest_ look at the War on Drugs? I also believe that bad laws compromise freedom and good laws protect freedom. One of the problems is that good laws often breed bad laws to patch things up.
No. True security for the community rests in a shared social standard which discourages actions which are harmful to the community or individuals. Security which requires a class of Guardians to protect everyone else is not security. It's safety, but it's temporary safety.

Not with a MITM. Mallet just signs the certificate first and turns it in, before the other entity even receives it. The bank has no way to tell which of those two certificates would be invalid... and the anonymous entity gets screwed. Signed bearer certificates are great for non-anonymous communication...

@_subject: why is no one (apparently) worried about escrowed key length limits? 
This is hardly questionable as the reason for restricted key lengths; if this wasn't the fact of the matter, they wouldn't make it difficult to superencrypt with the same system over and over again, which they do.
And "best" case for who?  Not I, surely. Simply putting a "national security" clause in this makes the CIA or SS or FBI or ATF or whatever above the law, regardless of the reasons.  I certainly don't want these organizations above the law.  I remember (well, not really.  But I've read about) J Edgar Hoover, and I don't want a repeat.
Archie didn't completely and blindly trust the government. Ozzie and Harriet, yes. Edith, probably.  Archie, no.  (ObGunPunks: remember the episode where Archie got to do the TV editorial about gun control? :-))

@_subject: Java Crypto API questions 
My guess would be that the first of these two points answers the second.  Everything is exportable -- except signed third-party security packages.  My bet would be that the exportable code would not be more than RC4-40 or perhaps 1DES, but that a signed package would go to RC4-128, 3DES, and RSA-1024.  However, the signature on that package would be on the condition that the vendor/distributor of that package follow all export This is the way Micro$oft's CAPI is supposed to work; it's got commodities jurisdiction approval already, my bet is Sun can get the same.

@_subject: NRC Cryptography Report: The Text of the Recommendations 
That is a modest misreading of the statement -- what it says is a sort of "generally available" requirement that the committee did a _BIG_ job of trying to soft-pedal at the conference.  Especially when PGP was mentioned, they said "well, it's not _really_ a 'generally available' recommendation."  But it _is_.  One Cypherpunk at the meeting suggested to me that they knew if PGP was mentioned, heads would roll, and this might be a quiet way of sneaking that in.
Yep, but OTOH, how much can they fit into a decent blurb anyways, which is all the actual recommendation text is? Which is as good as we could hope for from a government-sponsored report, whose team was required to include members of the intelligence community, and which those members know will be looked at seriously by congress.
While on the one hand I'm disappointed, OTOH it was much better than I expected it to be.  While it is essentially a "status quo" sort of report, it still allows us to deploy strong crypto now.
What I was most disappointed with was that (as far as I've found so far

Probably.  But they won't be able to export the signed 3DES package :)  It leaves foreign vendors in trouble, is where.

@_subject: 'robert' and his 'hipcrime' web site 
A few hundred dollars?  Probably not.  There's the domain name registration (perhaps, depending on when the name was registered -- I don't care enough to find out), and maybe $20/month to some other guy.  Perhaps more, but not necessarily.
Like... oh... I dunno... una-something... :-)  To be an "anarchist" has nothing to do with violence, necessarily, though.  Ghandi was an anarchist, of course, as are many other people (such as myself) who disclaim violence as a tactic.
Disagree strongly.  Are you aware of the source of the name 'hipcrime'?  It's from John Brunner's novel _Stand_On_Zanzibar_ (A _great_ book, btw), and describes a cynical, hipster-societal dropout philosophy (or at least style) that is inclined to look at people as no more than sheep. Applying this to the 'net populace is perhaps (I hesitate somewhat to apply the term) misanthropic, but not necessarily law & order.  Again, unabomber comparisons are obvious.
Still, like computer virii, the internet worm, all the promised intelligent agents and nano-mites we've been promised (which the hipcrime bot could certainly be seen as another precursor of, at least as far as intelligent agents go), there's a certain abstract beauty to the scheme, and a certain pathos.  I'm reminded of the limits to growth studies which showed islands exceed their capacity to carry a particular species, and the stunning sudden decline soon after.  (Come to think of it, that analogy might cover the remailer network)
