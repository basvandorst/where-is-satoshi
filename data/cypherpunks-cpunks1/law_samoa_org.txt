I prefer to keep a large jar of marbles available in the entry room,
aoupled with a hard floor, it makes it a bit tricky for an entry team
towork properly..
You can probably check out your local crack house for tips on preventing
forced entry..there seems to be a constant race between LEO entry tactics
and what the drug dealer do to defend themselves..
I might also suggest that you check out Bo Gritz'z SPIKE phase 8 video tape
"Perhaps one of most exciting phases and controversial. In Phase 8 you
learn Close Quarters Combat (CQC). You'll learn how to identify friend
or foe so that you don't shoot a friend. You'll also learn how to clear
a room safely and identify a terrorist and hostage."
SPIKE 8 also has a good section on room defense.
but then who am I to talk.
