Economics 101 for those who don't/won't check the archives:
The fundamental problem is Trust.
The basic concept of money is to act as a proxy for the exchange of goods
and services.
Say a farmer needs medical attention and a doctor wants pork chops. Without
"money" the farmer would have to pay the doctor with 100 bushels of grain (a
good) for the doctor's expertise (a service). The doctor would then have to
use the grain to pay another farmer for a pig, a butcher to kill it, and on
and on.
Obviously this is extremely inefficient (What's the farmer and doctor to do
if the doctor already has a ton of grain, but really wants pork chops ?)
"Money" allows the doctor to buy what he wants without transporting and
storing a ton of grain, and without having to make several exchanges to
finally get what he wants.
BUT, This only works if everyone involved TRUSTS that the money's proxy
value is stable, meaning that the value X mount of grain = Y dollars = Z
number of pork chops remains relatively fixed over time (at least for the
short-term of the transactions involved).
In the past, this trust was facilitated by utilizing materials that were
scarce and could not be obtained easily (gold, sliver, gems, pearls .etc.).
To further improve efficiency this trust became based on scarce documents
( by virtue of not easily duplicated ) first representing an amount of the
scarce materials mentioned above, and eventually becoming based on trust in
the institution managing it (bank, government, etc.).
Today, we are at the point where even the documents don't even need to
exist, the value is represented as numbers in a computer somewhere. We just
believe that when we use an ATM or a credit card that we will be provided
the goods and services we desire.
However, this trust is still mainly based on faith in the stability of a
government ( with banks being granted a "license" to utilize that trust).
In order for digital currency to become common place it must earn the same
level of trust that existing money systems have.
The problem is that the government has no interest in creating that trust
and in fact has a bigger interest in preventing that trust from forming.
So how do we develop this trust for digital cash ?
Digicash tried tying back to the trust of  existing money systems
E-gold, digi-gold, etc. are trying to tie back to the trust of scarce
materials (the jury's still out, however they still risk problems with
government interference).
It would seem to me that digital cash would be better off not being tied
either of these trust systems, but somehow develop it's own.
Currently the only viable solution I'm aware of is an electronic version of
"scarcity" by using unique serial numbers (using blinding techniques
to preserve anonymity). However, this requires a "central authority" (either
on-line or via smart cards) in order to determine whether the serial number
has been already utilized and thus no longer has value.
This requires that the users trust this authority to do its job.
The "free-market" solution is to have many central authorities and allow
users to decide which ones to trust. Authorities that maintain/improve trust
will succeed, those that don't will fail. Much like banks long ago issued
their own currencies. However, this won't provide the sort of ubiquitous
trust that "Joe Six-Pack" is going to expect today.
I don't know what the solution is, but I believe resolving this issue is the
next breakthrough cypherpunks will need.

Well (jamesd's "because they can" comment not withstanding) the stated
reason  for uncoupling money from precious metal was to allow the government
greater flexibility in controlling the supply of money. Supposedly they
could increase the amount of money available when times were bad (to make
things better) or decrease it during good times (to prevent inflation). Of
course it also allowed them (the government) to buy things without raising
taxes (just print more money), but they got burned when it led to inflation
in the 70's.
Check out Menard Keynes (sp?). Although I'm pretty sure most  people on this
list consider his ideas blasphemy :) .
There are still a lot people that believe the U.S. should return to the
"Gold Standard" meaning the amount of money in circulation should equal  the
amount of gold held by the U.S. government. That's what Fort Knox was
originally for.

@_subject: Gold 
The MAIN reason (and I agree that it's work-ability is a good secondary
reason, and I like the comment about cavemen finding it 'cause its shiny)
gold is used as a medium of exchange is because it is SCARCE.
If a modern day alchemist figured out how to easily turn lead into gold, it
would become worthless (well it might still be valuable when it was made
into art objects, like clay is).
All of gold's "romance" arises  from this scarcity.
I always liked the sub-plot in Scott Adams "Hitchhiker's Guide" books where
the accounts, middle managers, and "telephone sanitizers" that were sent to
earth to "prepare" for future inhabitation decided to use tree leaves for
currency, then set about to burn down all the trees "in order to control the
money supply".

Still plenty of "numbers" stations on the air. ( Background" A "numbers
station" is a short-wave station where transmissions consists of someone
(human or software generated) monotonously reading a sequence of numbers and
nothing else. Probably a messages encoded with a OTP).

My father in-law makes some extra dough by converting modern  power tools
(Delta table saws, belt sanders, and lathes) to run of a  central drive
shaft so the Amish in our area can build furniture.  Evidently it's "kosher"
to use a centrally located diesel engine (with a battery to start it even!)
to turn line shafts, belts, and pulleys to transmit power instead of wires.
They even use pre-manufactured drawer  guides and other hardware in their
furniture (and air compressor powered sprayers to apply stain and varnish).
Several Amish farms put telephones in their barns for emergency purposes (or
drive to nearby store to use a phone booth to call relatives, etc.).
So much for being "independent".

I wonder what kind of security they have at the Old River Control Structure
(ORCS) ?
The ORCS was built by the Corps in the 1960's to prevent the Mississippi
from changing its path from the route that  goes through
New Orleans to a more direct route via the Atchafalaya River ( a route that
is 170 miles shorter than it's current path). If the river did
change course, It would destroy a large wildlife sanctuary and would
eventually leave New Orleans and Baton Rouge without fresh water,
not to mention economic impact it would have.
It was almost destroyed during the massive floods of 1973 by scouring
(basically the the river undermining the foundation of the structure).
The Corp has since reinforced the structure and built a additional
structures to control the flow.

The group that lives in our area will seek treatment, if absolutely
I guess I should probably  point out that there are many Amish "sects" each
with different rules regarding the use of technology.
Some believe in using absolutely no "modern" technology (no electricity, use
horses instead of tractors, etc.).
Some will use "old" tech (seem my earlier message about using line shafts to
power machines as long as no electricity is used (yeah, yeah they use
electricity to heat the glow plug, go figure).
Some will use tractors instead of horses (but the tractors must have steel
wheels, rubber tires are a sin)
"Liberal" Amish will even drive cars, but they must not have any chrome
(they paint it black) and no white wall tires.
All and all they are pretty friendly people (always wave when you pass their
carriages, etc.).
The biggest problem they face (besides attrition from younger family members
leaving) is getting their carriages smashed by cars going 60+ mph  with
stupid drivers who don't realize how slow the carriages are. Of course the
government now requires them to have slow moving vehicle signs on the back
and recently, despite their objections, battery operated flashing amber

The Ames Strain of Anthrax wasn't "developed" in Ames, It was "discovered".
It was naturally occurring strain that was resistant to the anti-biotics
that were used to treat Anthrax at the time.
It is very commonly used in the study and research of bacteria, and up to a
few years ago  could be easily ordered from lab supply houses (as long as it
looked like an "offical" research organization, the company sent it).
It took a  white-supremicist scientist ordering it and then driving around
with it in the trunk of his car to convince the government more restrictions
to be put in place.

Unfortunately, Iowa and Missouri lie near the New Madrid Fault.
"The greatest earthquake risk east of the Rocky Mountains is along the New
Madrid fault system. Damaging earthquakes are much less frequent than in
California, but when they do occur, the damage can be far greater, due to
the underlying geology.
The New Madrid fault system, or the New Madrid seismic zone, is a series of
faults beneath the continental crust in a weak spot known as the Reelfoot
Rift. It cannot be seen on the surface. The fault system extends 150 miles
southward from Cairo, Illinois through New Madrid and Caruthersville,
Missouri, down through Blytheville, Arkansas to Marked Tree, Arkansas. It
dips into Kentucky near Fulton and into Tennessee near Reelfoot Lake, and
extends southeast to Dyersburg, Tennessee. It crosses five state lines, and
crosses the Mississippi River in at least three places.
The great New Madrid earthquake of 1811-12 was a series of quakes that
happened over a three-month period. The main shocks, the three largest
earthquakes, were estimated to be greater than magnitude 8.0 Aftershocks
included two events around magnitude 8.0, five magnitude 7.7, ten magnitude
5.3, and eighty-nine estimated at magnitude 4.3. The entire fault system is
believed to have ruptured in this series of earthquakes. Aftershocks were
felt in the region for more than a year. This was the largest release of
seismic energy in the continental United States. The only other larger event
was the Great Alaska Earthquake, in 1964."
Probably not going to be on anybodies' "top ten places to live" after  being
through a major quake in CA.

The Corps of Engineers has restricted access to most lock and dam
installations on the Mississippi (closed observation facilities and public
parks around the sites). Their concern is that terrorists may attempt to
destory them, causing the dissruption of barge traffic on the river.
They estimate over 60 billion dollars in  goods are transported by barge on
the river every year.
However, they plan no restrictions on river traffic.

In my home town the P.O. got in a snit 'cause the local newspaper was putting its paper in people's mailboxes. Solution ? People put up separate boxes for the paper.
I think you still have to get some sort of certification from the P.O. if you want to manufacture or  sell a box to be used as a mailbox. Go figure. I always liked my friends idea of solving the green house effect by requiring everyone in the US to permanently store the junk mail they receive thus storing the CO2 in the paper (that or requring everyone to stop breathing for  5 minutes).

To get around the CD-RW serial-number issue should be easy.
Buy a CD-RW with cash at a computer-fest or ham (amateur-radio) swap meet.
DON'T burn anything on the CD-RW that could be traced back to you.
At the last  ham swap meet I attended there was a guy selling loads of complete DSS systems off a pallet for $35 cash (It was a reputable swap-meet, so I don't think they "fell-off " a truck).
2 rows over was another guy selling smart cards.
Another row over was a guy selling smart card programmers.
Inside a building was a guy selling "technical information" on how DSS smart cards work, including source code for "example" smartcard programs  to "test" various "features" of the DSS system.  He had big  disclaimers saying "Don't use this info for illegal purposes".
Yeah right. I wonder how many morons bought all this stuff AND STILL plugged the DSS receiver into the phone line.
Attention MPAA/RIAA: I didn't purchase anything. There's enough crap on TV as it is, and I don't need an extra 500 channels of it.

to be exposed to the elements. They claim that their technology can cut through all but  100% fog,  when the rain is falling at 6in/hr etc. etc (This is where the vague comments about being able to communicate between ships in a storm without being detected by DF equipment were made).
