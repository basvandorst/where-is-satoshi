If THAT (he he he) is proof that Dimitri is Lance Detwieler then using
the same theory, so it Mutley the cartoon dog.
Nobody wrote this......I wish they hadn't bothered!

Sorry for the spam, but does anyone know if it is true that John Gilmore and this Logos
character are the same person ?
Before you dismiss the idea, just think about it for a minute.

Surely we have seen it all now.
I find it hard to believe that a word like

Poor Timmy May must not be able to vote then, as surely his ass must
have been "bashed" to death by now.

After whinghing about Dimitri and about people sending flames to the

sense Timmy.

Well  that was short and ..... errr  bitter!
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ There's a difference between being open minded and gullible Sandy.
Nothing like ducking and running away when your little game didn't turn
out the way that you wanted it to!
This is not a flame, it is my opinion but none the less I'm sure that it
will end up in the flames list or be conveniently lost in the masses of
mail that John's majordomo receives every day.

After reading all of these people babbling on about giving a vote of
confidence for Sandy I decided that I should also.
I have full confidence in Sandy:-)
(Well it normally works over here in the U.K...if a football manager
receives a vote of confidence from the board of directors it is a
foregone conclusion that his resignation will be handed in or his P45
will be handed out within days!)
