The fact is, at least in sentencing, Federal Judges now have very little discretion. The Federal Sentencing Guideline structure established in the 1980's provides "guidelines" for a given defendant convicted of a given set of charges. Things like prior offenses add "points", ratting on your friends takes away "points". In this case less is better than more. Anyway, a low level bureaucrat fills out a presentence investigation report on the basis of complicated, arcane rules it is easy to get wrong. This report goes to the judge who can pass sentence only within a narrow range, say 6 months 1 way or the other on a 5 year sentence (very few new Federal "crimes" carry less than this). Any departure from this range, either upward or downward, must be justified in a formal opinion, & can be appealed by either party. Very few judges bother. This system is cookie cutter in-justice at it's finest, & only a lack of bureaucratic imagination has prevented it from being computerized beyond the use of word processors to write the report. Since well over 90% of Federal Criminal cases end in guilty pleas, this method has the effect of transferring discretion that formerly belonged to the judge to the prosecutor, who gets to pick from a variety of charges covering the same offense, and the low level flunkey who gets to fill out the forms. This is exactly the big   problem with the new "crime" of using encryption in a felony in the Leahy bill.   Assuming for a moment this new law is tailored very narrowly & is only used on people   who 1. Commit without governmental entrapment an underlying felony. 2. Exclusively use encrypted traffic in direct furtherance of the underlying felony, (example: murder for hire is negotiated via encrypted messages) there still remains the fact that this is simply another tool of prosecutorial   discretion, of which there is way to much already. The problem with prosecutorial   discretion is that it is always used to encourage snitching, turning this country into a nation of Pavel Mozorov's (12 year old Hero of the Soviet Union who ratted out   his parents to the Cheka for concealing a pig from collectivization. His uncles did as   should be done in such cases & cut him up with an axe). However, I do agree that in setting conditions other than fines & prison time, Federal   Judges do have too much discretion. Chris Lambert (mthreat, Minor Threat) a 21 year old Austin cracker now doing time in Bastrop FCI, as part of his sentence is forbidden to   own or work with any computer w/ modem or network card/connection. This of course is to   apply after he gets out. Traditionally, counterfeiters, who come from the ranks of   printers, merely have to report to their parole officer & get his ok in order to own or   go to work for a print shop.         mthreat at paranoia.com

Really? I'm sure some of them are, but I remember reading in G. Gordon Liddy's
"Will" that  FBI Agents were assigned to check up on novelist Nelson Algren ("Man
With the Golden Arm") who was living with Simone de Beauvoir at the time. Seeing
both names on the mailbox of the residence, the agents filled in the surveillance
form with Subject: Nelson Algren, alias Simone de Beauvoir.

One doesn't need to be a "hard-core militia" type to realize the demolition
of the Murrah Bldg. wasn't caused by a truck full of ANFO 20 feet away. The
alleged method used, 20 seperate plastic drums of the stuff is the absolutely
WRONG way to get a coherent explosion of ANFO which needs concentration, not  air space between the containers. Further more, a truck bomb would create a
circular blast pattern, not the linear left to right pattern seen & caused by  shape charges planted on the structural columns inside the building.
Brig. General USAF (Ret.) Ben Partin, who designed & tested bombs while in  the Air Force wrote in a letter to various Congressmen, "I can say, with a  high level of confidence, that the damage pattern on the reinforced concrete  superstructure could not possibly have been attained from the single truck  bomb without supplementing demolition charges at some of the reinforced  column bases. The total incompatibility with a single truck bomb lies in the  fact that either some of the columns collapsed that should not have collapsed  or some of the columns are still standing that should have collapsed and did  According to Charles Mankin, head of the Geologic Survey at the University of  Oklahoma, referring to seismograph records of April 19, 1995 "We had two  events, ten seconds apart. The first one coincided in time with the explosion  at the Federal Building." A truck bomb did explode outside of the Fed Bldg as a cover & distraction for  the real demolition job inside. McVeigh is a dupe, a fall guy, about on par  with Lee H. Oswald in Dallas, November 23, 1963. The benefits to the statist  monstrosity & it's quasi-official allies like the ADL of the deaths of 168  people have been enormous. This in itself does not prove government agencies  are responsible for the bombing, but combined with the simple fact that the  damage could not possibly have occured the way they are claiming it did, it  adds up to certainty as to whom the real bombers are. Qui bono?
