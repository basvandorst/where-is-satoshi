Somehow I conflated IBM with FBI?
It was merely a typo. Really it was. Pay no attention to the man behind the
Of course, (if) it turns out that IBM actually *built* a keyboard sniffer,
but, that's no surprise, I expect anyone with a code.clue and a paranoid

We'll just have to see, I suppose. For IBUC so far I've met much more
regulatory enthusiasm for lower transaction cost than I have resistance to
potential anonymity.
As I'm fond of saying, reality, especially economic reality, is not optional.

I figured it would only really be relevant here, and I tried to restrain

As to sending it to lists which have subscriber-post-only, it is, as usual,
a consequence of spam prevention and not malice aforethought. Kinda sucks,
of course, because anonymous posters can't post. Hope they fix that in
future versions of majordomo, but I bet it'll be a while.

That's probably the way to do it, with all the anonymous remailers listed
in it, I bet.
Oddly enough, people who are clueful enough to use the current state of
remailer technology aren't clueless enough to spam with them. Or so it
seems from the content of remailer generated traffic I've seen, anyway.
