@_subject: [Cryptography] Crypto being blamed in the London riots. 
IIRC this came up last year when a Middle Eastern country (I forget which) were threatening to not let RIM operate unless they could intercept blackberry messages.
However, as was pointed out then, apparently the encryption is to & from RIM's servers, not the recipient. So RIM have access to all the 'secret' messages. I expect GCHQ & the Met will make sure said systems are patched in to their surveillance programme in no time.
Unfortunately the present climate in England is such that I can't imagine such measures being anything but lauded.
