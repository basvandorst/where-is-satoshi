Notice the Double Speak in the LA Times article below?
    What is taking place in Bosnia is Exactly the same thing
(Censorship) as the writer of the article is expressing concern about.
It is exactly the same conduct that the two NWO Stooges Metzl and Rep
Royce so enthusiastically endorse. It is only a question of whose ox is
being gored.
"Indeed, the United States and its allies are conducting a somewhat
operation in Bosnia. Two months ago, NATO troops seized and effectively
down a station run by hard-line Bosnian Serb forces after the station
broadcast inflammatory attacks on NATO forces trying to keep the peace
But it's a long step to go from these situations to the creation of a
permanent, formal unit run by the United Nations and scouring the world
search of radio broadcasts to jam. "
