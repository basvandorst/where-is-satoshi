@_subject: 64-bit CPU 10x faster in crypto? 
During a Digital seminar, a statement was made that 64-bit CPUs are about
10x faster than a 32-bit CPU in dealing with crypto, and that Alphas are
favorites of Crypto-affiliated Gov't agencies.  I spoke with a reference
within Digital and the following logic was presented:
  o A 128-bit key is processed in two 64-bit chunks, vs four 32-bit chunks,
greatly reducing processing time.
  o The Alpha executes four instructions per clock cycle.
  o Alpha clock ratings are 600MHz this summer.
  o Caveat: The O.S. needs to support 64-bit processing (Digital UNIX or
Linux, not NT).
I'm concerned about the strength of personal/corporate crypto in face of
large jumps in processing power.
I do not subscribe to cypherpunks due to the volume, so please respond to me
directly on this question.  stoutb at pios.com
