We visited a couple of weeks ago and I took some snaps of the rebuild
project BP has improved markedly since we last visited (about three years
ago). However the guided tours are even worse than ever (our guide
remonstrated with passers by for taking whilst he was droning on).
Take one of the excellent electronic guides and do your own tour.
