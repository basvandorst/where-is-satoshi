@_subject: [Pigdog] Forbes on Bitcoin - praise for its financial innovation 
Not what I would expect from Forbes.
"Therebs a lot of talk about dongles recently. Square has always
relied on a dongle and now PayPal is sporting a fancy triangle-shaped
dongle, nicknamed the bBlue Doritob. Both of these dongles equip your
mobile phone to accept and process credit cards securely by inserting
the device into the smartphonebs 3.5mm audio input jack. Apparently,
this passes for financial innovation in mobile payments but I file it
under the bnot-disruptive-enoughb category. Truly-disruptive financial
innovation is already here with decentralized bitcoin. And, bitcoin
doesnbt need a dongle!"
P.S. If you're not using  for finding the latest
