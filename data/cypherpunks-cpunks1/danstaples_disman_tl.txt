@_subject: Google to encrypt cloud storage 
Not so sure we need to be quite so cynical. Obviously this encryption is useless against state-level agencies, since data is encrypted server-side and Google manages the keys ( although the fact that they think they won't be obligated to hand the keys over to the gov't is bullshit). However, what I think is important to see in this story, is that Google is responding to pressure from the public to take privacy and encryption more seriously. This is an opportunity for security and privacy activists to push for real security solutions for user data storage, that involve strong *client-side encryption* of data.

@_subject: Android IMSI Catcher detection 
This morning's NSA article from WaPo contains some slides mentioning
USRP equipment[1]. It's hard to say without more context whether it's
referring to the GSM equipment from Ettus...anyone care to speculate?
The USRP series doesn't exactly seem like carrier-grade equipment, but
perhaps the NSA has a good reason to use it. Maybe baseband
exploitation, as coderman has previously mentioned? Simply getting cell
tower database dumps from the telcos would suffice for location info, so
I would guess this has a different purpose.
