I believe the posession of property is a priv. to be taken away if abused.  There is no such thing as a 'right' to property--in fact the very notion seems absurd.

I've lost but one account--world.std.com (Software Tool &
Die) soon to be purchased by the conglomorate Plug Pullers
R US.  That was entirely related to a local rent control
matter.  Now I may be a 'twit'--that is an entirely
different matter.
   I would say though that if one makes false statements as has
this 'snow' character it indicates a lack of credibiltiy.
  Something you seem unable to do.  Isn't it odd how some will
tell you how insignificant and irrelevant you are only to devote
so much of their time and energy to you.  I find that very odd.
  Well thanks George but I do think his statement speak for themselves.
I'm not in the least concerned someone like him could harm me--in fact
I find it very amusing that he is deemed 'acceptable for that list
while Dr. Vulis is not.
   Well that's sort of like Tiny Tim Skirvin and his Global Killfile--
it does him more harm than those he is after--in fact little Tim reads
my every word.
  And based on lies as well--I've only had one account terminated--that
by Barry Shein who lives in Brookline, Ma. and that was entirely do
to real estate industry money and the rent control issue (a statewide
referrendum on rent control which existed only in Brookline, Cambridge,
and Boston)--many millions of dollars at stake there.  Shein is simply
a whore.
  Well my suggestion--given the size of the list and that we have
numerous sympathizers there--is to have all of their posts forwarded
and publically post them for free and open discussion.

Well--if you look at the ownership of wealth in the US including
but not limited to real estate you'll find much the same.  And that
ownership is not, to my mind, in the least legitimate.
  That's a fair question.  I don't begrude one's ownership of their
fair share--but I do have serious problems with what we shall
call 'accumulators' if you will.  For them I have contempt and no--
they do not have that right of possession and often such 'work' is
at the expense and on the backs of others.

Well labels--'socialist', 'communist', etc. can be quite misleading'
as they mean many different things to different people but they do
push emotional hot buttons.
  I don't understand the 'exhorbitant taxes' thing--in the US our
taxes are absurdly low compared with most of western Europe and
our social services a disgrace.  I don't know what it's like in
the UK but compared with the rest of Western Europe our tax rate
is a joke designed for the upper classes.

Well of course you have--but the majority of people

and do not derive the same benefits--that needs to

  I agree--that's not what I was talking about--the majority of wealth
is handed down not earned--and the ability to earn also more often
than not results in hand me down priv.

Yes--crossbreeding has it's advantages.
  That's not even close to the truth.
  What a simple mind--coming from an Ann Rand fan though that's really
no surprise.
  Because I'm on the Freedom Knights list you assume I am speaking
on their behalf?  And because Adam is on the cypherpunks list you
assume him to be speaking on their behalf?  That's rather simple
minded.  My tie to Freedom Knights has to do with the belief that
one may freely speek their mind on the net--period.  My beliefs
regarding the redistribution of income may or may not be shared
by different members of the FK list. Personally I don't believe
in the right to accumulate excess wealth and certainly don't believe in the 'right' to pass it down through the generations.

Well the EFF has been morally dead for a very
long time--the majority of their funing comes
from large corporate interests, they ALWAYS side
with business owners ove users, and the ACLU shot
them down for their active role in approval
of the Exon Ammendment.  They are essentially a
lobby for business interests on the net and
could give a shit about individual users rights.
They are not deserving of any respect.

Well China is nor more of an example of communism than Argentina
is of Capitalism--they are both totalitarim regimes that use ideology
as an excuse to plunder.  It would be unfair for example to use
Marcos wife (and her shoe collection) as an example of why capitalism doesn't work.
  Perhaps by some--not most.  Many die without wills--the wealthy
tend to be much more careful with such things of course but you could
allow provisions to have a percentage donated to non-political chartible   I sincerely don't believe that.  If you look at your above
examples, or Bill Gates below, much of their motivation is not
the accumulation of weath per se but rather power and performance.
I know I would do much the same job (not that I'm in the wealthy)
even if the salary were more or less--I enjoy it (I'm a programmer).
Same is true for education--much of the motivation is either intrinsic or status oriented and has little or nothing to do with
  Not at all--no more or less so than in capatilistic societies.
  That's true--as with all labor--but it is a matter of scale.  Gates would do the same thing if you limited his income just
for the sake of power accumulation--he's got all the money
he could ever consume.  That's not his real motive.
  Yes-our auto industry is a disgrace and I agree we do no favors
protecting them or bailing them out.  On the other hand goverment must protect against the creation of business monopoly which is
even more stifling.
   Sorry to chop out so much about Microsoft--but sure most wealth is
transferred in this country--that's a statisitical fact.  Yes--there
is consumption but when accumalation gets into the multi-millions that
becomes irrelevant--money grows as you know--stocks, property, etc. and
that is all that is passed down.  There are few on either of these mailing
lists that if given 10 million dollars could not sit on their ass for
the rest of their lives consuming comfortably and watch their money double
by the time they pass away.
   As inefficeint as it is it is really the only effective means.  A
simple 100% inheritance tax would be very helpful as would limitations
on how much property a given individual (and a corporation is a virutal
individual) may own.
  Well the original issue we were discussing was the fact that
a majority of wealth in the US in not earned--it is inherited.  That
can be changed very quickly with proper legislation.
  As to your other issue here--earnings and limitations on accumulation,
much would be equalized without inheritance.  But yes--there would
still be accumulators--most would still produce regardless of
limits because as I said their motives are not simply income--power,
prestige, etc. all come in to play as well as the gratification that
comes with winning.  Gates enjoys his cover on Time Mag. much more
than a few extra million a day.
  But the basic answer to your argument--from my standpoint--is that
some people are extremely intellegent, others very gifted in other
ways, others very dull witted, etc.  Some possess artistic genius
that can pay off immediately, others have none that is valued dollar
wise by society.  I sincerly don't believe one has the right to
live better than the other--that the rewards, if different, sould
be negligable.    If I could make as much as I do know programming by working as
a clerk in a convenience store or whatever I would still choose to
do what I am doing.  If you are in a different situation you're
in the wrong career.
