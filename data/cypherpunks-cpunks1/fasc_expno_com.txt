First American Scientific Corporation has developed new technology that
we feel is of global significance to problems arising from human waste
disposal activity.  Full details are available at
  .
The technology, which is built into our Kinetic Disintegration System, is called Kinetic Disintegration Technology (KDT) and incorporates standing sound waves and kinetic energy to disintegrate virtually all non-metallic
substances into powders as fine as -400 mesh.  This means that previously
problematic recyclables like rubber (tires), gypsum (drywall), plastics,
insulation, glass, and bio-solid wastes can be cost-effectively
"micronized" and separated for re-use as industrial raw materials.
This information will be of particular interest to investors, municipal
engineers, agricultural research facilities, waste disposal engineers,
recycled product developers, and others who have an interest in
solving the crises being generated by worldwide waste disposal.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
