Hash: SHA1
algorythm keys but to generate and signing a message with 4096 bits key , will take much times, than with 2048 or 1024

I just want to know which are stronger and securer the MPILIB, RSA or Why the key which generated by MPILIB and DSS are much longer than which generated by RSA.

How long  you can brute forte attack this message ???
If you're right, that you only do it in 2 days, so BRUTE forte my message, it was encrypted with PGP Mail 4.5 with 2048 bits, and here I give my public key. Remember this is only for a test, so this public key won't find in any keyserver.
