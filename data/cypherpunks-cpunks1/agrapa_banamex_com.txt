Remember that the Internet is an international playground and while the
U.S. Government may say "Rate your site or go to jail" or worse yet
filter traffic that is not rated (blind censorship), the rest of the
world may go on its merry way and not even flinch (crypto is a good
example). Sounds like a state-run New York Times. The phrase "harmful to
children" also means different things in different countries.
Maybe the idea is that countries and/or sites that do not rate their
content will be blocked from accessing U.S. sites (immigration law on
the net). Other countries could do the same in retaliation. That would
mean the loss of access to a lot of information for all sides.
passport and visa".
And what happens to all those international sites hosted on U.S.
territory? If they were to move out it would mean a loss of $$ for U.S.
companies (again).
Also, don't forget that state laws would impede interstate commerce
(loss of revenue for the state). I see the word "boycott" in my future.
Somebody please slap the person who said the Cold War was over.
I'm glad that somebody has finally discovered time travel. Unforunately
its in back in time not forward!

April 8, 1997
The Bad Apple
by Declan McCullagh (declan at well.com)
     To those of us who follow such events, it's
a common enough scene: a squad of civil liberties
attorneys troops into a federal courtroom to do
righteous battle with an unconstitutional law. It
happened this week in New York City, before a
judge who finished hearing testimony yesterday in
a case the ACLU brought against yet another state
Net-censorship statute.
     The outcome in this lawsuit, however, will
reverberate not just in the Empire State but also
along the marble corridors of the U.S. Capitol.
If the Supreme Court rules that the
Communications Decency Act indeed violates the
First Amendment, Congress hopes the New York case
will guide it in revising the law so it passes
constitutional muster. And given how the New York
case is shaping up for the forces of unbridled
free speech, that could be ugly.
     A group of 15 plaintiffs challenging the New
York statute filed suit in January, arguing that
that the law unconstitutionally stifles online
speech and unduly interferes with interstate
commerce on the Net. The measure, which took
effect last November, amends the penal code by
making it a crime to distribute online pictures
or text "which is harmful to minors." Attorneys
for the New York attorney general's office, who
are defending the law, say that the "harmful to
minors" legal standard isn't as heinous as the
CDA's "indecency" ban -- it covers only sexually
explicit pictures, not textual conversations.
They also argue that filtering software could be
used to help online purveyors of adult-only stuff
comply with the state statute.
     Of course, as always, academics, librarians
and artists point out that these attempts to
limit online communications are overly broad and
ill-defined. What I consider harmful to a kid
might not be what you consider harmful, after
all. Yesterday four witnesses testified for the
plaintiffs, uniformly saying they felt threatened
by the law. "I walk around with a healthy fear
that every book in our collection would give
someone the idea that we're giving harmful
materials to minors," said Maurice Friedman,
executive director of the Westchester Library
System. Rudolf Kinsky, an artist from Poland,
weighed in next: "I feel a chilling effect on my
creativity. Someone could consider my art harmful
to minors and could prosecute me. I came to this
country [from Poland] looking for freedom of
speech, not this."
     But yesterday's testimony seemed like the
capper to an overwhelmingly poor showing the
government made in its opening arguments last
week. The government's case lasted a mere hour
and was hardly persuasive. Among other gaffes,
the state failed to slide a new legal standard --
"level of maturity" -- into the discussion; Judge
Loretta Preska quickly rebuffed that attempt: "I
don't read 'level of maturity' anywhere in the
statute," she said, nettled. That wasn't the only
time Preska pounced on the government. By the end
of the three-day hearing, I was ready to bet good
money on the ACLU winning yet another victory for
the Net.
     But I have a confession to make. In January
I claimed that "knocking down New York's law
should be a virtual slam dunk," saying it suffers
from all of the same problems as the CDA. But
now, after reading a recent law review article by
UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, I'm not as
sure. Volokh points out that the government could
rely on the ready existence of ratings schemes,
such as RSACi and PICS, which give publishers the
ability to keep their material out of the hands
 "Under the existing
doctrine, it would be constitutional to
criminalize the display of any harmful-to-minors
material which does not carry a correct rating."
     In other words, rate your web pages with
RSACi or go to jail. (I can't see Microsoft, the
Software Publishers Association and other RSACi
boosters probably opposing this. I can smell
another Microsoft world-domination plot brewing
already...) Indeed, Volokh told me yesterday that
he thinks the New York attorney general may have
a workable case. "I think the state has a decent
defense. They could say look, this rating imposes
a burden but not a very high burden. It's like
that imposed on a bookseller. All you're required
to do is put on this label."
     Certainly, Net rating systems played a big
part in the New York trial. Last Friday a
government attorney asked: "In general, what
would be more burdensome as a whole: requiring
millions of web sites to rate their contents or
just requiring a percentage of web sites that
contain graphical objectionable material to rate
their web sites?" What the government was trying
to point out was that rating systems like RSACi
 -- that let you assign values to web pages based
on nudity or violence -- are increasingly
commonplace. If they're commonplace, then
netizens may be able to comply with the New York
law. And if netizens can comply with the law,
then it may be constitutional.
     "Harmful to minors is something people will
talk about again and it's an option, but I don't
want to say we'll be out there trumpeting it,"
says Connie Correll, spokeswoman for Rep. Rick
White, a Republican congressman from Washington
State -- whose district includes Microsoft.
(Coincidence, or another Microsoft attempt at
world domination? While you're pondering the
question, keep in mind that White championed
"harmful to minors" language in December 1995,
but Congress rejected it in favor of the CDA's
broader "indecency" ban.) Correll adds: "People
are watching the New York case. I think it's
going to be a real good indication." So do I.

I would guess that this means that Netscape and Explorer send the
URL of the page that linked to another site in the "HTTP-REFERER" header
the clear when SSL is used.  The only temporary solution is to use a
proxy that removes this header, or, as the article suggests, manually
an URL that is linked from a page using SSL.  I can't think of too many
situations where one might follow a link to another site immediately
sending sensitive information, but the contents of the "HTTP-REFERER"
are often logged, and the log is often world-readable...

Stupid programmers abound even in large corporations. Bugs, patches and
security holes are now normal everyday things. I agree with Toto.
Companies should take more responsability in the programs they produce.
Especially nowadays when a lot of people without any computer background
or insight into the dangers are accessing the Net. Why does Netscape
(and microsoft) warn users about secure and insecure forms? So they can
say "I told you so!" when you get screwed by someone. Same thing goes
for the GET method. Whatever a "stupid CGI author" does has little
bearing on the issue. It's like saying the tire fell off my car because
the person who built the road to spec ("GET" is allowed) is to blame not
the car maker. I should be warned about certain roads by the car maker.
If "GET" is allowed but unsecure YOU should warn me!
Admit it! It did not occur to your programmers to warn about access to
"GET" forms like it occurred to them to warn about http references
inside a https-accessed document. Now we have to live with it.
And you say "stupid CGI authors". What if they did it on purpose? Are
you going to say "then its stupid web users"? I'd really like to hear
you say that in public!
NO WAY! The web author is NOT entitled to know where I came from. So if
you go to Sears the saleperson is entitled to know you came from
JCPenney's? If so, then I am just as much entitled to not tell him or at
least entitled to know that there's a sign on my back that says where I
came from. How many web users are aware of the HTTP REFERRER header? Not
many, especially if they have not read the specs or looked at the logs
from a web server. As an adminsitrator I AM NOT ENTITLED to that info.
Accept responsibility?  Ok, that's wishful thinking. How about not
blaming others? How about warning your users? You didn't do it in this
case. If you do then you can say "I told you so!"

Re: SSL & GET
I suspect that the pass-the-buck syndrome is in full force.
If the specs authors should realize that programmers are going to code
by them then shouldn't programmers realize that users are going to use
their products?
The user, the specification author, the browser manufacturer, the server
manufacturer, and the content provider all share the responsibility.
Just 'cause its in the specs doesn't mean (shouldn't mean) that everyone
else can just wash their hands of it. There are stupid users, stupid
specification authors, stupid browser manufacturers, etc. If the specs
are not secure the user shouldn't use it, the manufacturer shouldn't
code to it, etc. OR SHOULD THEY SHARE RESPONSIBILITY? I guess the real
solution will come in court when someone tries to sue a content provider
who tries to sue a server manufacturer who tries to sue a browser
manufacturer who tries to sue a specs author.
My concern is that the author of the comments, who works for Netscape by
the way, is passing the buck on to the content provider. Its great
policy for Netscape, bad policy Netscape's clients.

No, specification authors should take more responsibility in the specs
that they produce.  The HTTP spec's use of GET is insecure.
writers should realize that people will follow their specs, and should
be thinking of security and privacy issues as they are beig written.
Why not?  It's a useful tool to find out who has linked to you.
On the other hand, it _is_ a privacy concern, and I don't want to send
to sites I visit.  So I included an option blocking the Referrer tag in
Cookie Jar, the cookie-blocking program I wrote.   I'd like to think
writing it helped push Netscape into supporting better options for
(see rfc2109) and into adding this option for not sending Referrer
but I'm sure there were many other louder calls for the same thing.
Users need to educate themselves.  Even a fairly security and privacy
concious company like Netscape still has exectutives who feel as though
they have to answer to the bottom line and who will sacrifice consumer
privacy to get there if they feel that the advantages outweigh the
Netscape has consistently led industry in realizing and fixing and
security holes and privacy issues, largely due to the effort of Jeff and
the rest of their security group in educating upper management on those
issues and making them realize their importance.  However I am not
to bet my privacy on Netscape's good will, as it could turn at any time.
The way to real privacy is to educate oneself.  Demanding companies to
"fix it" is lame and ineffectual.  You have the technology-  fix it
yourself!  Distribute your code.  Make the companies look bad.
Educate the sheeple.  But asking companies to look out for your privacy
is a waste of time.

I too have my doubts about Microsoft software. Yes, they clearly
incompetance on the part of the rest of the industry" but another
important reason is better marketing. Netscape, for example, could have
beaten out MS if they had had better marketing and strategy
I believe the point of the Justice Dept. investigations is anti-trust
issues more than it is a witch hunt. We all know that monopolies can,
but not necesarily do, produce inferior products. Anti-trust laws are
meant to facilitate competition on even ground and that can lead to
better products for us the consumers. MS canï¿½t be blamed for the incompetence of the rest of the industry. If
MS wins anti-trust litigation then so be it but someone has to keep them
in check. We elect the people who appoint others to review these
matters. If no one does it then soon weï¿½ll see "Microsoft Compatible"
stickers on the dashboards of our cars, toasters, beepers, etc. And what
will happen to Unix then when we live in a Microsoft compatible world?
BTW, my beef with MS is primarily quality. If they want to dominate the
market then they better give me quality or Iï¿½ll spend my money
elsewhere. Would you buy a Ford if you knew the tires would fall off if
you donï¿½t install the **latest-and-greatest Service Pack**? I, for one,
will keep bugging MS to produce better products. In the meantime, Iï¿½ll
keep buying from the Unix side (which is also lagging).
