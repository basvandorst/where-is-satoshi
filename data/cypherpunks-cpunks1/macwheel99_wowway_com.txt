Boeing may have the biggest drone so far.  It is an airship, flying cell
The Phantom Eye: *	wingspans of 150 feet;
*	gross takeoff weight of 10,000 pounds; *	room for up to a 450 pound payload; *	two four-cylinder engines each providing about 150 horsepower. It
runs on liquid hydrogen, not only making it greener than the rest of the
U.S. military's drone fleet, but, Boeing believes, three times more
energy-efficient. *	Most drones are lucky if they can stay aloft for a day at a stretch.
The Phantom Eye aims to stay in the air for up to five days, and about three
times higher - at 60,000 feet.
Flying cell towers can have two functions:
*	Surveillance society listen in on everyone's phone calls;
*	Disaster response, fly over where there was just an earthquake, or
severe weather, to provide cell phone tower service, until ground
infrastructure has been repaired.
 i-phone can be a ground station for drone control.
mobile-ground-station-for-drones Add to our acronym list: LaWS = Laser Weapons System The Navy calls it a "directed energy pulse weapon."

believe the US has done so as far back as Reagan's Star Wars, but apparently
it is a first for US Navy ships to have lasers to defend them against
I do not believe this will protect the navy from underwater drones.
Bad weather can allegedly mess with laser quality, but I believe science has
the ability to distort a beam at launch point to compensate for what the
weather is about to do.
Each "bullet" costs $ 1.
Each "gun" costs $ 32 million.
To put that $32 million in perspective, consider some alternatives:
*                    $1.5 Trillion = how much USA has so far invested in the
War on Drugs, in 40 years, according to link at footnote.[1]
*                    $1 Trillion = how much USA has so far invested in the
War on Drugs, with nothing to show for it, in terms of any change in volume
of people addicted & consuming the stuff, according to Rep John Conyers
(D-Michigan) in a Congress hearing I saw on C-Span.
*                    $400 Billion = estimated size of future civilian drone
*                    $24 Billion = DoD Budget request[3] for drones
*                    $16 Billion (more than) = DoD plans to spend 2008-2013
to improve drone technology & acquire more of them.[4]
*                    $6 Billion = US Navy budget for Drones.[5]
*                    $4 Billion = How much NATO plans to spend on drones
over the next 20 years.[6]
*                    $3 Billion = How much the USA spent on unmanned
aircraft in 2010.[7]
*                    $3 Billion, or 37% = increase in costs beyond initial
estimates, for Pentagon acquisitions.[8]
*                    $1.4 Billion = investments in improvements to US drone
base in Djibouti.[9]
*                    $1 Billion (Canadian) = Starting Budget for Canadian
Drone fleet.[10]
*                    $200 million = Cost of Navy Drone which crashed June
2012 in Maryland.
*                    $100 million = what the USA would save each year, if
the detainees were transferred from Gitmo to Super Max inside USA.
*                    $ 1.5 million from NASA to whoever can first perfect
the Jetson's vehicle.[11]
*                    $30,000 to $50,000 is the expected cost of a small
drone for use by a police dept, which is about the same as what they expect
to pay for a police car.[12]

@_subject: [drone-list] Semi-Autonomous Military Weapons 
Here is news of another advancement in drone military technology.
Lockheed is now marketing a semi-autonomous stealthy unmanned system
 Note this is not fully-autonomous.  In case you are not fully familiar with
the implications of autonomous drones, here is clarification from my Drone
*	Autonomous Drone = Concept of a Drone which does not require human
involvement to pilot it, decide where it is to go, decide who it is to shoot
at, refuel it, maintain it, update its programming.[1]  There have been
stories alleging that some drones are in testing which go part way towards
these goals, not yet achieve all of them in one craft.
*	See: AHAR; AUSV; AWS; SAWS.
*	AHAR = Autonomous High Altitude Refueling[2] Basically, drones will
need the same kinds of services as manned flight.
*	AUSV = Autonomous Unmanned Surface Vehicle.
*	AWS = Autonomous Weapon Systems.
*	QUOTING  International Committee for Robot Arms Control (IRAC):[3]
*	Department of Defense Directive 3000.09
 [4] "for the
development and use of autonomous and semi-autonomous functions in weapon
systems" defining an AWS as "A weapon system that, once activated, can
select and engage targets without further intervention by a human operator."
The ability of the system to select and engage targets autonomously makes it
an AWS even if it is human-supervised with a possible human override; thus
"human on the loop" is assigned the same status as "human out of the loop,"
a conservative (good) policy.
*	UNQUOTE
*	SAWS = Semi-autonomous weapon system
*	The International Committee for Robot Arms Control (IRAC)[5] says
the DoD defines SAWS, as QUOTE:
*	"A weapon system that, once activated, is intended to only engage
individual targets or specific target groups that have been selected by a
human operator." The category includes systems that automatically acquire,
track, identify and prioritize potential targets or cue humans to their
presence, "provided that human control is retained over the decision to
select individual targets and specific target groups for engagement." It
also includes weapons with terminal homing guidance, and "fire and forget"
weapons where the target has been human-selected.
*	UNQUOTE
*	See: Autonomous Drone; AWS; DoD.
*	In Drone Robots, see SAWS, where I express misgivings about "fire
and forget" implications.
As usual, in case my footnotes don't come thru, ask me if you wish to see
the citations involved.
My Drone Robots covers the implications of autonomous drones in more detail,
including specific examples of autonomous weapon systems already being used.

Drone Club  Drone attacks have consequences, altering what groups are allied with what
other groups, for what goals.  This leads to CIA relocating their bases of
operation.  Here is a tale of one Ugly American, from the perspective of
Pakistan. Article adapted from "The Way of the Knife: The C.I.A., a Secret
Army, and a War at the Ends of the Earth," published by the Penguin Press.
Former Blackwater employee Raymond Davis, and a C.I.A. team, had set up
operations from a safe house in the city of Lahore Pakistan, where some of
these groups were apparently based.  As I have shared earlier, both under
international law, as the US interprets TNIAC,[1] and as UN investigations
of targeted killing and state-sponsored assassinations have written,[2] CIA
agents, and their civilian contractors, do not enjoy any kind of diplomatic
immunity for their actions where there is no war going on. They are also
legitimate targets for their enemies, because they are engaged in a war,
where otherwise there is peace.  From the perspective of the nation where
they are operating, they are no different than criminal gangs.
While Davis had been navigating dense traffic in Lahore, two young men had
approached his car on a black motorcycle, their guns drawn, at an
intersection congested with cars, bicycles and rickshaws. Davis took his
semiautomatic Glock pistol and shot through the windshield, shattering the
glass and hitting one of the men numerous times. As the other man fled,
Davis got out of his car and shot several rounds into his back.
He radioed the American Consulate for help, and within minutes a Toyota Land
Cruiser was in sight, careering in the wrong direction down a one-way
street. But the S.U.V. struck and killed a young Pakistani motorcyclist and
then drove away. So the Pakistani police picked up Mr. Davis, for questioning.
An assortment of bizarre paraphernalia was found, including a black mask,
approximately 100 bullets and a piece of cloth bearing an American flag. The
camera inside Davis's car contained photos of Pakistani military
installations, taken surreptitiously.
The evidence at the time indicated that the men Davis killed had carried out
a string of petty thefts that day, but there was an added problem: the third
man killed by the unmarked American S.U.V. fleeing the scene.
Davis was taken to Kot Lakhpat prison.  Washington DC demands his release.
Pakistani people demand a death sentence.
What Davis and the CIA had been doing in Lahore was NOT to fight US enemies,
but allegedly to get entangled in the India-Pakistan disputes.  Eventually
leaders on both sides agreed to a deal.  The reckoning for Davis's actions
would come in the form of "blood money," or diyat, a custom under Shariah
  that compensates the families of
victims for their dead relatives. The matter would be handled quietly, and
Davis would be released from jail.  After weeks of discussions, the parties
agreed on a total of 200 million Pakistani rupees, approximately $2.34
million, to offer "forgiveness" to the jailed C.I.A. officer.

Professor Bill Allen, a former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter, is teaching
a three-hour course titled "Science Investigative Reporting: Drone
The class is using drones made by the school's engineering department.
lect-news/ To fly a drone in US National Air Space (NAS), requires FAA licensing, which
includes certification that the drone is safe, and that it is flown by
someone who has a pilot's license.  I do not see U of Missouri on list of
authorized drone licensees which EFF found out from FAA via FOIA.
They keep adding to the list, so maybe UM is on a list I have not yet seen.
If flying exclusively indoors, drones do not need FAA licensing.
I am sure that as soon as someone is caught flying a drone inside Congress,
White House, a Legislature, Court Building, or other official site, this
loophole will be altered.

Some time in April 2012, China planned a drone strike in Myanmar against a
drug lord responsible for the death of 13 Chinese sailors.  Before
implementation, the target got arrested, and now is in China appealing a
death sentence.  News media stories Feb 2013 speculate that China had no
intention of informing Myanmar of this operation. ne-to-bomb-drug.html This parallels:
*       USA and NATO allies drone strikes in Pakistan and other nations,
ignoring their sovereignty;
*        Israel uses drones in its war with various enemies in the occupied
o       And
o       Also

*        Mexico army drones against drug cartels just inside USA territory;
 *         Turkey drone killed 34 innocent Kurdish villagers, just inside
Iraq, mistaking them for drug smugglers.
 o        and
There are probably more such cross-border drone attacks, whose details I do
not have handy.

@_subject: [drone-list] DHS FOIA on Privacy from Drones 
DHS (US Dept of Homeland Security) came out TODAY with a FOIA document
internally dated Sep 2012, regarding Privacy from Drones.
f I started subscribing to news of OTHER people FOIA regarding drones.
Occasionally I see some very interesting info there.
I downloaded it, naming my copy "DHS Drone Privacy 2012 Sep" (I name based
on institution, topic, vintage)
I don't see any copyright notice, limiting re-distribution.
It is 3 pages, 221 k, informing us about a working group led by:
*        CRCL = Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
*        PRIV = Privacy Office
*        Alphabet soup of organizations within DHS which use drones, or plan
to use them.  There are some unfamiliar acronyms there, which I will be
working on finding translations for.
This working group will address privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties
issues, with drones, which people have been screaming at DHS for years to
They just thought this would be a good idea to do.  I suspect some of the
screaming directed via Congress may have something to do with the timing.
CRCL and PRIV are aware of
*        CBP (US Customs and Border Patrol) allegedly operates approx 10
Predator drones at and along US borders.
*        USCG (US Coast Guard) helps train CBP, and is evaluating their own
future drone acquisition.
*        S&T (I am guessing this refers to Science and Technology
Directorate of DHS) which oversees a partnership with local law enforcement
and first responder drone usage.
o       I learned about S&T of DHS at
 They do not believe that DHS has any other active drone programs, but
recognize things may change in the future.  I will be checking my notes,
because that list looks awful small.
*        DHS = US Department of Homeland Security  [1]
o       Some US states also have departments with the same name.
o       DHS is one of the largest departments in the US government.  Its
mandate includes:
*        Anti-Terrorism Domestic
*        Border protection
*        Citizenship
*        Critical Infrastructure protection
*        Cyber Security
*        Emergency Management - FEMA
*        Immigration
*        Ready dot Gov
*        Transportation Security Agency (TSA)
*        US Coast Guard
*        US Secret Service, which protects the Currency, President, and
other key officials
o       DHS is one of several federal departments and agencies supposedly
flying drones over US National Air Space (NAS).[2]
