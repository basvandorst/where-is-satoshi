Hey Squatter!
Have you found the hidden "hot" spots and registered to win the Shaq/Pepsi
World's Slammin' Techno Dream Contest?  Deadline to enter is March 31st,
only a few days away.
Don't miss out on your chance to win a $25,000 Gateway computer shopping
spree and a trip to Orlando, Florida to meet Shaq and catch the Magic in
All ya gotta do is find the hidden "hot" spots.  Seem impossible?  Well,
here are a couple of hints:
"Shaquille O'Neal is his name,
Movies and basketball are his game.
So cruise by La La Land or Adrenalin to give your luck a try,
And find the ball that Shaq has left behind."
"Twinkle, twinkle little star,
25 grand could go real far..."
Good luck!
