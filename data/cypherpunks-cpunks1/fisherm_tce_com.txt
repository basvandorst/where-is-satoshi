@_subject: Vertical vs. Horizontal Crypto (was: RE: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source code)) 
And this holds true for vertical as well as horizontal applications.  Unlike
Mr. Stallman, I think that there is a case where closed-source software is
appropriate, and that case is vertical applications.  Just as I wouldn't
propose that TCE release the source code for our devices (RCA TVs, ProScan
VCRs, etc.), as the intellectual return on the release would be low (how
many people are going to write low-level software for their own TVs?), I
think it is also inappropriate for other vertical-market applications
(another example: book library maintenance software).
However, some of the bad effects of closed-source crypto can be countered by
the use of open crypto protocols, like TLS/SSL, OpenPGP, IPSec, and the
like.  Although this still won't protect against all attempts at getting
around the security of the crypto protocol, at least some crypto protocols
are pretty immune to these kinds of attacks -- for example, a PC web browser
talking to a set-top box using TLS should only be able to be subverted by
the set-top box itself, not by a third party through a hole in the protocol.
I'm somewhat surprised that no one has brought this (open crypto protocols)
up in the discussion before.  (Could it be that I had an original idea?

This matches what I've seen.  Mr. Bell made the big mistake of directly
attacking the IRS (the mercaptan [sp?] attack).  I've had some dealings with
local government people on real estate issues (who have generally been
reasonably helpful), and the set of people who like practical jokes has a
(nearly?) null intersection with the set of people who go into government

The only entities that might be neutralized by single-DES are her husband

built for less than $250,000 in 1993, which is just pocket change for large
corporations (like GM) and well within budget for medium-sized corporations
(like Thomson Consumer Electronics, where I work).  There are several
individuals on this list who could afford to build a single-DES cracker
themselves, although they might have to take a hit on their affordability of
their current lifestyle.   You need to catch up on your reading as to what
capabilities small organizations and private individuals now have in terms
of breaking computer-based security.

IMHO you haven't done much budgeting or defense work.  I worked on a project
secret enough that I still can't mention the name of the project (although
the name itself is unclassified -- my association with the project was
classified, however).  Budgeting is still a factor in defense work.  Your
messages start to sound like the crypto that Tom Clancy uses in his novels,
crypto that always annoys me because it is so fake.  I agree that the NSA
may have a few tricks up its sleeve on top of some pretty powerful
specialized cracking hardware, but we are talking about needing heavy
wizardry to do real-time cipher cracking, not just some parlor tricks that
drop the work factor by 1000 or so.  For the NSA to generally do what you
propose, they would need some exponential-time methods, methods that would
drop the work factor by 10^78 (or something like that).
It is just a whole lot easier to do a black-bag job on a North Korean
embassy (for example) than to directly attack their crypto.  That is why
defense companies do background checks, that is why some areas of military
facilities are guarded by soldiers with guns, and that is why the NSA tried
to conceal all evidence of their existence for a while.  Crypto is just one
part of a unified security policy -- sometimes not a very important part at

Mike, the main reason the Jim Bell prosecution started was his actions, not
his words.  Some of us on the list (myself included) would be majorly upset
if a stink bomb strong enough to make us vomit was used on us (upset enough
to want someone to take action against Jim Bell).  Had Jim Bell restrained
himself to speech, prosecution would have been much more difficult to start.
Not impossible, but much more difficult.
No government is going to be perfect, as they all must rely on us imperfect
humans for implementation.  However, the tradition in the United States has
been to restrain the government from doing any old thing it likes.  This
doesn't mean that our government will always be fair and just -- it just
means the tendency is strongly that way.  Most other nations are not nearly
so fortunate.  Just because we as a nation have suffered through injustices
like Ruby Ridge does not necessarily mean that we on the downward spiral to
where such cases are the norm.  It does mean, as it always has, that the
fight for justice and right must be made anew by each generation.

already being pursued by your antagonist, *and* you have been personally

If you have not been personally identified, then your antagonist must either
personally identify you or monitor all possible remailer network entrances.
Monitoring all remailer network entrances can be done, but it is not for the
weak of wallet.  Even large governments do not have unlimited resources --
they must pick and choose their targets, rather than trying to go after
everyone.  The Soviet government and its puppet states encouraged people to

Regulating the net to this extent would be a huge undertaking.  Trying to
regulate dead-tree publishers to this level would be a large undertaking, a
task not likely to be accomplished without a lot of debate in Congress --
and there are many fewer dead-tree publishers than net publishers.
