   Yeah and since when has this country been so easy to quit and find a new    job with the same relative pay???? Do you think it's that easy??? Uh I    don't think so.. duh huh... I can't even get a summer job working at a    computer store and I'm very computer literate for my age. Did I SAY that it would be easy?  But nobody will stop you from
quitting a JOB.  A government may well try to stop a citizen of its
country from leaving.  That's my point.

   But I mostly agree with everything Mats has said. Leftists should take
   heart that crypto anarchy also reduces the power of corporations (many
   of whom climb into bed with government the first chance they get to
   suppress competition, get favorable laws and patents, etc. As
   Mussolini said, "Fascism *is* corporatism.")
Now where have I heard that?    ;-}
   Many leftists I know claim to be anti-capitalist, naturally. But they
   are often deeply market-oriented, participating in "farmer's markets"
   with zeal. To libertarians, of course, this *is* capitalism! (Read
   Karl Hess' "Capitalism for Kids" for an easy treatment of this. Lots
   of other libertarian books, too.)
Sigh!  Tell me, do you subscribe to Bill Bradford's rag "Liberty" too?
I can never throw away "Lassiez Faire Books" catalogs, even though
they have a pathological worship for Nathan Blumenthal...

   A challenge /response may make sense crypto-wise, but not $$-wise.
   The car would then need a receiver too, & the house a transmitter.
   More things to buy & break.
   A one-way solution is needed to make it fly here.
Okay, here's my "bright" "idea"...
A 32-bit counter, a 32-bit somewhat-random "salt", a 32-bit fixed
authenticator and a 32-bit checksum, two DES blocks.  The transmitter
just counts up each time the button is pressed, and the whole thing is
DES'd in CBC mode with the symmetric key or what have you.
The receiver decrypts, verifies the checksum and perhaps the
authenticator and just checks for the count to be greater than the
last time it received a signal.  This handles replays and doesn't
require exact sync between remote and base.
The receiver can have a reset button inside so the owner can push it
and click the remote if somehow the receiver gets skipped way ahead.
Counterexamples, anyone?

skipped way ahead.  This DOES, however, require different counters and
authenticators for different remotes.
It can also be done with a one-way hash if the salt is omitted and the
receiver can try, say, the next few dozen sequence numbers against the
received string.
Counterexamples, anyone?

   What is the difference if a big company subjects its employees to a    key-escrow system or if the government does it with the people. If you    think about it, the government could coerce the company into reading    through information being passed back and forth....
Employees have the option of not sending personal information through
the company system, instead using a service they hire themselves.  The
people, if subjected to key-escrow in their private communications,
would only have the option of not sending the information via
electronic means if they wanted said info to be out of the range of
The government should NOT be viewed similarly to an employer in its
relationship with citizens.  Employees are free to quit and make their
income some other way.

   But what is the reason of the involvement of "law enforcement" and the
   "intelligence community" in this matter? I refer you all to the
   upcoming conference agenda, the involvement of NIST/NSA, TIS, Denning,
   and FBI Director Louis Freeh. Look at the papers being presented at
   the conference.
   Any questions?
   .............................................
   If a system contains "protocols especially suited for eventual    mandatory use", like SKE, does this of necessity mean that the    developers intended that it should become part of a nationally-mandated    open avenue to spying on anyone who uses it?
Not of necessity.  (One senses some bottom-covering here...)
It DOES of necessity mean that they are, wittingly or unwittingly,
contributing to opening the avenue.  It is incumbent upon us to make
them aware of that contribution, so that their consciences may be
tortured thereby.
If in fact they have any.

OOOooooo.  I think this means one had better use superencryption of
one kind or another with Clipper at all times.  Pardon me if this
is redundant, but has anybody done any differential analysis of, say,
DES (or 3DES) under Clipper, to see if it weakens?

   I have recently come into the possession of 3 working Ridge 3200
   super-mini's running Unix. I intend to place all 3 on a ethernet
   hooked into my inet feed and have one as a re-mailer.
   On the remialer front what I intend is sorta the following:
   1. all messages sent out will be sent encrypted. This will require
   both sender and reciever to have a public key on record w/ the
   mailer.
How about the sender encrypting with the REMAILER'S public key, and
the remailer sending out encrypted with its own private key?  That way
no registry is necessary.  If a sender doesn't trust the remailer,
let the sender sub-encrypt the message inside the remail headers.
   2. messages will be cached and re-transmitted after a random delay.
   I intend to generate a random number between 0 and 24. When the
   appropriate hour arrives all messages with that time stamp will be
   sent encrypted.
I hope some header field can be defined to specify a maximum delay,
and perhaps use the random number as a proportion of that maximum.
   3. We intend to support anonymous as well as explicit addressing.
Could you amplify on this?
   Anyone got any experience w/ Ridge products? I have contacted the
   designer and he is willing to help us out (Ridge is out of
   business) with support on the 3 machines.
Pretty snappy, but make sure they're well cooled.

   I am not worried about their trusting me, I *don't* trust them...
   If the sender wants to encrypt that is fine. I will encrypt ALL outgoing
   with the recievers public key. Assuming the original reciever wants to
   reply the original sender will need a key in order for me to encrypt to
   them.
Please excuse my density, but against what are you defending by this
measure?  What don't you trust them about?

   All messages will recieve a time stamp for transmission that will be no
   more than 24hrs away. The time stamp will be random. Until the clock    matches the stamp it sits encrypted w/ the recipients keys in a cache.
   Submitters will have no say in how long the message waits. If you want
   encryption and security you have to give something up. Besides if a user
   don't like the way I run it they don't have to use it.
True.  Then again, if it's your goal to provide something useful
that'll be used, well, a fixed 12-hour-average delay places a pretty
tight upper bound on usefulness.

   >
   Yes, a sender will be able to designate whether they wish their return    accdress to be hidden behind an anon system or else we leave it on there
   relying on the encryption for security.
Cool.  Will it employ "anon handles" like some of the personals
remailers use?
   On the issue of traffic analysis:
   It occurs to me that simply monitoring a remailers feeds and their traffic
   analysis will provide enough information to determine the difference between
   bogus (ie random generated) and real traffic. While it may be possible for
   a sysadmin to make their systems traffic appear confusing *if* they don't    factor in their feeds traffic when a spook looks at not only the target    system but the feed systems and the traffic analysis on them you could
   determine to some degree of precision the amount and possible the actual
   bogus packets v the real traffic. Just a thought...
If I understood this properly, maybe you could scale back the
"Potemkin" traffic to level out the load.

   Why should I trust them at all? Why should I willingy become an
   occomplice in any of their activities? I don't [want?] anyone,
   including me, being able to figure out what is going on. But more
   importantly you seem to assume that these pair of communicators are
   not trying to determine something about me with their traffice.
So you're trying to prevent the users from finding something out about
you?  What, exactly?  Trying to understand the issue here.
   By encrypting the outgoing the reciever is
   shure that it came from my re-mailer and not somebody else.
If you encrypt it with the remailer's private key, yeah.  I thought
you were saying earlier that you'd encrypt the outgoing messages with
the recipient's public key.  Did I misunderstand?
