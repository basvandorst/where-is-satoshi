@_subject: Random Hiss from Mac mike 
I've been looking at using the Mac's Sound Input Manager for hardware RNG.
The advantage of it is that (1) most macs have a microphone port these
days, (2) it doesn't involve any user interaction, (3) the API is easy.
What I don't know, is how secure it is.  Or more precisely, I don't know
how much entropy is contained in the signal.
In the simplest case, where the microphone is not attached, the signal
consists of  long runs of '0x80's alternating with '0x7f's.  Now, I have no
problem transforming this into uniformly distributed RN's : just hash the
buffer with MD5.
My question is, how many bytes get fed into the hash?
Obviously, enough bytes so that I have 128 bits of entropy.
Preliminary tests give me a max entropy of about .65 bits per sample byte.
That's not very much, but if I can sample at ~20 KHz, that's 1625 bytes per
That's estimated by recording the length of runs and computing the entropy over
the entire sample: i.e. the sum (for k = 1 to 120) of -(fraction of runs of
length k * log2 of that fraction). That works out to about 3.3 bits per run
with an average run of 5.1 bytes.
I suspect there's much less entropy in that signal than even this estimate,
but I don't have any way to conduct tests with pure 50 cycle power and
uniform ambient temperature.  Or whatever else biases the signal.  For all
I know, every time someone in this building starts his microwave it biases
the signal.
Does anybody have any experience/advice in this area?

Just to sidetrack the issue, a bit.  Are there any ex-Nazis who participated

This is a little different from the US. I've never heard of anybody being
jailed or fined for libel/slander, just sued for it.
No. You can't libel the dead.  Most historians would get their socks sued
off if you could.  I remember reading about a case once in which two sons
wanted to sue the man who had libelled their dead father.  They couldnt do
it through normal channels, father being dead and all, so they publicly
called the libeller a liar, repeatedly, eventually provoking _him_ to sue
_them_ thereby allowing the truth of the original liber to be tested in
court.  The sons won; a moral victory at least.
So in other words, the Holocaust-Denial crime is a creative extension of
existing libel laws.
Useful to know that.  Aachen is just down the road from here.

It's extremely difficult to do that and not get laughed out of court.
Think about it.  If the president or congress could be sued for their official
actions, every unemployed auto worker would be suing them for not restricting
Japanese imports.  That's what sovereign immunity is for; to keep the
government from being nibbled to death by millions of little nuisance suits
from soreheads all over the country.
Well actually, Congress is probably not subject to it's own laws on privacy.
I remember during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings there was a bit of
a to-do about exactly who it was that leaked Anita Hill's allegations to the
press; and Joe Biden was going around saying "No crimes were committed, no
crimes were committed."  This was explained as Congress-speak for "The leak of
Hill's allegations were done by a Congressman, not a staffer" (It's illegal
for staff member to disclose confidential material, but it's OK for his boss
to do it).

This wasn't really my point.  Grassley's bill implies that uploading crypto
to an overseas FTP site would qualify as a predicate act, needed for a RICO
seizure.  I think he is assuming that someone would do this for the
purposes of making money: and that anything bought with that money would be
RICOable.  I don't think he or anyone else in Congress is aware that people
tend to do this stuff for free.

uploaded it to an FTP site?  He's not profiting.  The guy who uses it? He
