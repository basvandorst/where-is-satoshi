State Pulls the Plug On SIPRNet
November 29, 2010 at 9:26 pm
Late last week, after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed the White House of the likely fall-out from the WikiLeaks cable dump, the White House came back with a question: bWhat's our corrective action?b
Clinton's undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, had a simple suggestion: pull the plug on SIPRNet [1], the classified DoD network that PFC Bradley Manning reportedly used to download the cables from State's inhouse classified database. bThe White House said do it,b says a senior administration official.
The publication by WikiLeaks of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables, many of them classified, is forcing an administration-wide intelligence retrenchment as agencies reconsider how to balance the need to share with the need to know. With its third major dump of controversial classified information in nine months, WikiLeaks is single-handedly tipping the balance back towards inter-agency "stovepiping", or walling off information from other departments.
Post 9.11 the imperative from Congress and the White House was to break down the bstovepipesb that prevented sharing across the so-called intelligence communitybthe sprawling collection of intelligence offices in more than a dozen different agencies across the U.S. government and around the world.
At State, they created the bNet-Centric Diplomacy" database or NCD, where State stored classified information up to the top secret level. Agencies across government had access to that database through their own secure networks. In DoD's case the network, created in 1995, was called the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet.
Late last week, at Kennedy's recommendation and the White House's approval, State disconnected SIPRNet from the NCD, senior administration officials tell Time. bObviously there were some gaps within SIPRNet that DoD is actively correcting,b the senior administration official says, bAnd as a temporary precaution we have disconnected SIPRNet from the NCD.b
How long is temporary? DoD is investigating how Manning managed to download all those cables and get them to WikiLeaks, the senior administration officials tell Time. So far they have concluded that the failure came at Dod's Central Command, the combatant command responsible for the middle east, which employed Manning in Iraq. Prior to Manning's download, users of SIPRNet had been blocked from downloading data to removable media.
But at some point that restriction was lifted across all of CentCom. DoD has been reimposing restrictions since the July dump of Afghanistan war documents by WikiLeaks. DoD has blocked the use of removable media; they have required in some cases a bdual keyb system that requires a second user to approve moving data from a higher classification system to a lower classification system; and they are installing software programs to monitor unusual activity.
DoD is not completely cut off from State's database. A separate system for the transmission of top secret information, the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System or JWICS [2], is still linked to the NCD. And State may reconnect SIPRNet in the future. bOnce DoD has gone through and made its corrections on SIPRNet we'll reevaluate whether to reconnect,b the senior administration official says.

@_subject: <nettime> WikiLeaks and the Culture of Classification 
I don't think Wikileaks works on the level of operationally-relevant secrets. It's not about espionage. So the fact that there are other forums where more highly valuable stuff is being exchanged, doesn't diminish the value of Wikileaks. It's precisely its high profile and media exposure that constitutes its value. It's not about espionage, it's about politics. And, it's about inducing inducing dysfunctional habits into the organizations trying to prevent information from leaking. Assange called this once 'secrecy tax' and if I take this article here at face value, it seems to be working.
WikiLeaks and the Culture of Classification
October 28, 2010 | 0853 GMT
By Scott Stewart
On Friday, Oct. 22, the organization known as WikiLeaks published a cache
of 391,832 classified documents on its website. The documents are mostly
field reports filed by U.S. military forces in Iraq from January 2004 to
December 2009 (the months of May 2004 and March 2009 are missing). The
bulk of the documents (379,565, or about 97 percent) were classified at
the secret level, with 204 classified at the lower confidential level. The
remaining 12,062 documents were either unclassified or bore no
This large batch of documents is believed to have been released by Pfc.
Bradley Manning, who was arrested in May 2010 by the U.S. Army Criminal
Investigations Command and charged with transferring thousands of
classified documents onto his personal computer and then transmitting them
to an unauthorized person. Manning is also alleged to have been the source
of the classified information released by WikiLeaks pertaining to the war
in Afghanistan in July 2010.
WikiLeaks released the Iraq war documents, as it did the Afghanistan war
documents, to a number of news outlets for analysis several weeks in
advance of their formal public release. These news organizations included
The New York Times, Der Spiegel, The Guardian and Al Jazeera, each of
which released special reports to coincide with the formal release of the
documents Oct. 22.
Due to its investigation of Manning, the U.S. government also had a pretty
good idea of what the material was before it was released and had formed a
special task force to review it for sensitive and potentially damaging
information prior to the release. The Pentagon has denounced the release
of the information, which it considers a crime, has demanded the return of
its stolen property and has warned that the documents place Iraqis at risk
of retaliation and also place the lives of U.S. troops at risk from
terrorist groups that are mining the documents for tidbits of operational
information they can use in planning their attacks.
When one takes a careful look at the classified documents released by
WikiLeaks, it becomes quickly apparent that they contain very few true
secrets. Indeed, the main points being emphasized by Al Jazeera and the
other media outlets after all the intense research they conducted before
the public release of the documents seem to highlight a number of issues
that had been well-known and well-chronicled for years. For example, the
press has widely reported that the Iraqi government was torturing its own
people; many civilians were killed during the six years the documents
covered; sectarian death squads were operating inside Iraq; and the
Iranian government was funding Shiite militias. None of this is news. But,
when one steps back from the documents themselves and looks at the larger
picture, there are some interesting issues that have been raised by the
release of these documents and the reaction to their release.
The Documents
The documents released in this WikiLeaks cache were taken from the U.S.
governments Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), a network
used to distribute classified but not particularly sensitive information.
SIPRNet is authorized only for the transmission of information classified
at the secret level and below. It cannot be used for information
classified top secret or more closely guarded intelligence that is
classified at the secret level. The regulations by which information is
classified by the U.S. government are outlined in Executive Order 13526.
Under that order, secret is the second-highest level of classification and
applies to information that, if released, would be reasonably expected to
cause serious damage to U.S. national security.
Due to the nature of SIPRNet, most of the information that was downloaded
from it and sent to WikiLeaks consisted of raw field reports from U.S.
troops in Iraq. These reports discussed things units encountered, such as
IED attacks, ambushes, the bodies of murdered civilians, friendly-fire
incidents, traffic accidents, etc. For the most part, the reports
contained raw information and not vetted, processed intelligence. The
documents also did not contain information that was the result of
intelligence-collection operations, and therefore did not reveal sensitive
intelligence sources and methods. Although the WikiLeaks material is often
compared to the 1971 release of the Pentagon Papers, there really is very
little similarity. The Pentagon Papers consisted of a top secret-level
study completed for the U.S. secretary of defense and not raw, low-level
battlefield reports.
To provide a sense of the material involved in the WikiLeaks release, we
will examine two typical reports. The first, classified at the secret
level, is from an American military police (MP) company reporting that
Iraqi police on Oct. 28, 2006, found the body of a person whose name was
redacted in a village who had been executed. In the other report, also
classified at the secret level, we see that on Jan. 1, 2004, Iraqi police
called an American MP unit in Baghdad to report that an improvised
explosive device (IED) had detonated and that there was another suspicious
object found at the scene. The MP unit responded, confirmed the presence
of the suspicious object and then called an explosive ordnance disposal
unit, which came to the site and destroyed the second IED. Now, while it
may have been justified to classify such reports at the secret level at
the time they were written to protect information pertaining to military
operations, clearly, the release of these two reports in October 2010 has
not caused any serious damage to U.S. national security.
Another factor to consider when reading raw information from the field is
that, while they offer a degree of granular detail that cannot be found in
higher-level intelligence analysis, they can often be misleading or
otherwise erroneous. As anyone who has ever interviewed a witness can tell
you, in a stressful situation people often miss or misinterpret important
factual details. Thats just how most people are wired. This situation can
be compounded when a witness is placed in a completely alien culture. This
is not to say that all these reports are flawed, but just to note that raw
information must often be double-checked and vetted before it can be used
to create a reliable estimate of the situation on the battlefield.
Clearly, the readers of these reports released by WikiLeaks now do not
have the ability to conduct that type of follow-up.
Few True Secrets
By saying there are very few true secrets in the cache of documents
released by WikiLeaks, we mean things that would cause serious damage to
national security. And no, we are not about to point out the things that
we believe could be truly damaging. However, it is important to understand
up front that something that causes embarrassment and discomfort to a
particular administration or agency does not necessarily damage national
As to the charges that the documents are being mined by militant groups
for information that can be used in attacks against U.S. troops deployed
overseas, this is undoubtedly true. It would be foolish for the Taliban,
the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and other militant groups not to read the
documents and attempt to benefit from them. However, there are very few
things noted in these reports pertaining to the tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTP) used by U.S. forces that could not be learned by simply
observing combat operations  and the Taliban and ISI have been carefully
studying U.S. TTP every hour of every day for many years now. These
documents are far less valuable than years of careful, direct observation
and regular first-hand interaction.
Frankly, combatants who have been intensely watching U.S. and coalition
forces and engaging them in combat for the better part of a decade are not
very likely to learn much from dated American after-action reports. The
insurgents and sectarian groups in Iraq own the human terrain; they know
who U.S. troops are meeting with, when they meet them and where. There is
very little that this level of reporting is going to reveal to them that
they could not already have learned via observation. Remember, these
reports do not deal with highly classified human-intelligence or
technical-intelligence operations.
This is not to say that the alleged actions of Manning are somehow
justified. From the statements released by the government in connection
with the case, Manning knew the information he was downloading was
classified and needed to be protected. He also appeared to know that his
actions were illegal and could get him in trouble. He deserves to face the
legal consequences of his actions.
This is also not a justification for the actions of WikiLeaks and the
media outlets that are exploiting and profiting from the release of this
information. What we are saying is that the hype surrounding the release
is just that. There were a lot of classified documents released, but very
few of them contained information that would truly shed new light on the
actions of U.S. troops in Iraq or their allies or damage U.S. national
security. While the amount of information released in this case was huge,
it was far less damaging than the information released by convicted spies
such as Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames  information that crippled
sensitive intelligence operations and resulted in the execution or
imprisonment of extremely valuable human intelligence sources.
Culture of Classification
Perhaps one of the most interesting facets of the WikiLeaks case is that
it highlights the culture of classification that is so pervasive inside
the U.S. government. Only 204 of the 391,832 documents were classified at
the confidential level, while 379,565 of them were classified at the
secret level. This demonstrates the propensity of the U.S. government
culture to classify documents at the highest possible classification
rather than at the lowest level really required to protect that
information. In this culture, higher is better.
Furthermore, while much of this material may have been somewhat sensitive
at the time it was reported, most of that sensitivity has been lost over
time, and many of the documents, like the two reports referenced above, no
longer need to be classified. Executive Order 13526 provides the ability
for classifying agencies to set dates for materials to be declassified.
Indeed, according to the executive order, a date for declassification is
supposed to be set every time a document is classified. But, in practice,
such declassification provisions are rarely used and most people just
expect the documents to remain classified for the entire authorized
period, which is 10 years in most cases and 25 years when dealing with
sensitive topics such as intelligence sources and methods or nuclear
weapons. In the culture of classification, longer is also seen as better.
This culture tends to create so much classified material that stays
classified for so long that it becomes very difficult for government
employees and security managers to determine what is really sensitive and
what truly needs to be protected. There is certainly a lot of very
sensitive information that needs to be carefully guarded, but not
everything is a secret. This culture also tends to reinforce the belief
among government employees that knowledge is power and that one can become
powerful by having access to information and denying that access to
others. And this belief can often contribute to the bureaucratic jealously
that results in the failure to share intelligence  a practice that was
criticized so heavily in the 9/11 Commission Report.
It has been very interesting to watch the reaction to the WikiLeaks case
by those who are a part of the culture of classification. Some U.S.
government agencies, such as the FBI, have bridled under the post-9/11
mandates to share their information more widely and have been trying to
scale back the practice. As anyone who has dealt with the FBI can attest,
they tend to be a semi-permeable membrane when it comes to the flow of
information. For the bureau, intelligence flows only one way  in. The FBI
is certainly not alone. There are many organizations that are very
hesitant to share information with other government agencies, even when
those agencies have a legitimate need to know. The WikiLeaks cases have
provided such people a justification to continue to stovepipe information.
In addition to the glaring personnel security issues regarding Mannings
access to classified information systems, these cases are in large part
the result of a classified information system overloaded with vast
quantities of information that simply does not need to be protected at the
secret level. And, ironically, overloading the system in such a way
actually weakens the information-protection process by making it difficult
to determine which information truly needs to be protected. Instead of
seeking to weed out the overclassified material and concentrate on
protecting the truly sensitive information, the culture of classification
reacts by using the WikiLeaks cases as justification for continuing to
classify information at the highest possible levels and for sharing the
intelligence it generates with fewer people. The ultimate irony is that
the WikiLeaks cases will help strengthen and perpetuate the broken system
that helped lead to the disclosures in the first place.

@_subject: <nettime> Anonymous Hackers Release 90, 000 Military E-mail Accounts 
[This new tendency of dumping the full raw data onto the public
networks makes WikiLeaks more editorial approach to publishing
material seem positively reasonable and measured. I wonder if this is
preferable to those who criticize WikiLeaks for having turned into
just another information broker.]
theepochtimes.com -> The bhacktivistb organization Anonymous Operations posted some 90,000 military e-mail addresses and passwords, to the Pirate Bay torrent website on July 11, in what they called bMilitary Meltdown Monday."
The organization hacked into the networks of government contracting and consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, where they claim to have discovered ba list of roughly 90,000 military e-mails and password hashes ... 4gb of source code,b and bmaps and keys for various other treasure chests buried on the islands of government agencies, federal contractors and shady whitehat companies.b
Anonymous further claims that Booz Allen was involved with several government surveillance and intelligence-gathering programs bthat may be deemed illegalb and insinuate that several of Booz Allenbs executives, all former members of the Nation Security Agency, garnered illegal government favor in their private business efforts.
Anonymous preceded the release with multiple lead-up tweets from several of their affiliated twitter accounts. One account, banonymouSabu,b formerly part of the LulzSec hacking group, claims that this is the first of btwo of the biggest releases for Anonymous in the last 4 years,b and sent a warning to the intelligence community, stating bEveryone brace. This is literally explosive.b
Another account, bYourAnonNewsb, states that btodaybs  release will without any doubt be the biggest release so far.b
bAntiSecb or operation Anti-Security, was a collaborative effort between hacker groups LulzSec, Anonymous, and various others to attack and steal confidential information from major governments and corporations, and expose perceived corruption and abuse of power. LulzSec disbanded in late June, its members reintegrating with their original foundations in The websites and networks of numerous companies and government organizations have already been attacked in the name of AntiSec. Anonymous believes that their efforts are simply a form of civil disobedience, calling their tactics bpeaceful protest." The government, meanwhile, has been actively trying to track down and arrest its members.
Anonymous made headlines last year when they attacked MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal after the companies had suspended payments directed to the information leaking website WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.

@_subject: <nettime> Enter the Swarm: Anonymous and the global protest 
dear nettimers,
here's my take on the endlessly fascinating Anonymous story. Written
for LeMondeDiplo, where it appears in the current issue in a slightly
edited version and under a different title.
All the best.
Enter the Swarm: Anonymous and the global protest movements
In the course of just one year, using the identity bAnonymousb highly
efficient digital attacks have been carried out against global
corporations and national governments. All in the name of freedom
of speech and social justice. The media coverage has done little
to clarify the events, rather, contradictory characterizations of
Anonymous have been espoused, ranging from an elite hacker conspiracy,
to a loose network of ignorant teenagers, from a major cyber-terrorist
threat to a mere nuisance driven by sophomoric humor. None of these
characterizations is entirely incorrect, because each captures some
fragments of the phenomenon, but they all miss the central element of
Anonymous, namely that it is not one, but many, and that it is not a
group or a network, but a swarm, or to be correct, multiple swarms
that feed off each other.
Anonymous might be an extreme case, but in important ways it is
typical for the wider protest movements spreading across the
crisis regions of the Middle East, Europe and the US. It is in
the contrasting organizational forms that the chasm between these
movements and their political systems is most manifest. One the
one side are hierarchical organizations based on the principle of
representation, where leaders are formally legitimized through
procedures of delegation, usually based on voting, to speak and
act on behalf of their constituencies. Corruption, favoritism and
institutional capture, however, have weakened this legitimacy. On the
other side are self-consciously leaderless organizations which reject
the principle of representation in favor of direct participation in
concrete projects. Their diversity enables decision-making through
rough, ad-hoc consensus, rather than through formal majorities. From
the point of view of established political institutions, these new
forms of organizations are nearly unintelligible, hence the often
voiced astonishment that the protest movements do not articulate any
concrete demands that those in power could engage with.
Social swarms
A social swarm consists of independent individuals who are using
simple tools and rules to coordinate themselves horizontally into
a collective effort. As Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the Swedish
Pirate Party, points out bthe complexity comes with the meritocracy
that makes up how the Swarm operates and decides on courses of action
as an organism. As all the people in the Swarm are volunteers b they
are there because they think the Swarm can be a vehicle for change
in an area they care about b the only way to lead is by inspiring
others through action.b1 Thus, the strength of the swarm comes from
the number of people who join it and the focus it brings to their
distributed, independent efforts. A swarm always starts in the same
way. A call for action and the availability of some resources to start
acting right away. Social media pundit Clay Shirky identified three
main requirements that must come together for such loosely organized
cooperation to emerge: promise, tool, and bargain.2 The promise is the
call for action. It needs not only to be relevant to a critical number
of people but also credibly attainable. The tools are the resources
and strategies available to work towards the promise. Today, tools to
coordinate the efforts of volunteers are readily available online and
different tools, such as online forums, wikis, or chats, are capable
of sustaining different social dynamics on all scales. The bargain
points to conditions one has to accept when entering the collective
space of action. Only when the three dimensions match for a large
number of people b the promise being attractive, the tools available,
and the bargain not too onerous b cooperation gets underway. Over
time, each of the three dimensions can change, and the swarm can grow,
change direction, or fall apart. For such swarms not to be random
and short-lived affairs, there needs to a fourth elements, a common
horizon, which, as cultural critic Brian Holmes explains, ballows the
scattered members of a network to recognize each other as existing
within a shared referential and imaginary universe.b3
Anonymous is a series of swarms, each organized around a particular
call for action, focusing individual efforts towards that common goal.
Each swarm is independent of the others in the sense that each must
attract its own contributors based on its individual combination of
promise, tool, and bargain. But they are united in the sense that
they feed off each other by operating under the same open identity,
consisting of a few relatively generic slogans, graphic elements
and cultural reference points. Anyone can wear this identity like a
mask, but it only make sense to be Anonymous if it resonates with the
particular culture of twisted humor, anti-authoritarianism and free
speech accumulated through its history.
The dark corners of the Internet
Despite all efforts to bcivilize the internetb, most recently
re-affirmed by Nicolas Sarkozy during the eG8 meeting in Paris last
May, dark corners where anythings goes have continued to exist. Of
particular relevance to Anonymous is a site called 4chan.org, a
technologically simple, but massively popular web forum, founded in
2003, where people can post images and texts without registration,
thus appearing as banonymousb online. The site not only encourages
anonymous postings, but its most active section, the forum /b/-Random,
explicitly has no rules as to what can be posted. The site also has
no memory, that is, all postings that do not generate responses
will automatically move down the queue and eventually be deleted.
This usually happens within a few minutes. No records are kept.4
The only memory is in the minds of the users, thus, everything that
is not easily remembered and repeated vanishes. To avoid quick
disappearance, hundreds of posts per day are framed as calls for
action, such as a proposal to vandalize an article on Wikipedia with,
say, the 67th suggested article being chosen. If that entices enough
people, a small swarm descends on the article. Just for the fun of
it. Because of the need to keep things alive through repetition
and involvement, over time, a collective culture emerged that was
stripped of individuality and origins and was reduced to a few
easily available elements that can be assembled and transformed by
anyone with basic internet skills. Around such calls, or operations,
a culture emerged of bultra-coordinated motherfuckaryb, as one
participant told Biella Coleman, an anthropologist of geek culture.5
Over the course of half a decade, anonymous turned into Anonymous, a
simple technical placeholder into a collective identity. Because of
the anonymity-induced culture of outrageousness the common horizon
of this identity grew from a strong, even extreme commitment to free
speech and a deep distrust against any kind of authority that tries to
regulate speech based on what are perceived hypocritical lies.
Into the limelight
It is not a coincidence, then, that in winter 2008, some people
began to use this identity to start a campaign against the Church
of Scientology. There has been decade old battle between hackers
and Scientology. The hackers would facilitate the leaking of
damaging insider information exposing fraud and manipulation and
the church would ruthlessly use its considerable means to suppress
such information and destroy the personal reputation of its critics.
Anonymous got involved after the church tried to suppress the
circulation of a motivational video in which the actor Tom Cruise, a
high-ranking church member, comes across as particularly unhinged.
As a response to the usual threads of legal action, a semi-serious
video was released in which Anonymous announced the destruction of the
church. After a period heated debated inside various chat channels
b an important part of the infrastructure of spontaneous, real-time
coordination b a particular combination of promise, tool and bargain
was hashed out and a common horizon established. Not only were online
actions against the website coordinated, but also a global day of
action was planned and executed. On February 18, 2008 protests in more
than 90 cities in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand
were held. Many of the participants were wearing the now famous Guy
Fawkes masks to protect themselves against the likely revenge of the
church. Their sheer presence and irreverence made up for the lack of
political demands, as they pierced an important myth that the church
could crush anyone who dared to criticize it. For the first time,
some swarms of Anonymous had congregated outside the Internet and had
coordinated themselves with more established political activists. The
fun turned serious. These protests continued to be the main political
focus of Anonymous over the next two years. In September 2010, another
Anonymous swarm emerged around the Operation Payback, which began as
an attack against Aiplex Software, an Indian Company hired to disrupt
file sharing sites such as The Pirate Bay.6 It quickly spread to
attacks on the website of the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of
America) and many other pro-copyright organizations. The operation's
rallying cry resonated strongly within its larger environment: bThey
call it piracy, we call it freedom.b
In the course of these actions, the political identity and
technological / tactical sophistication of Anonymous as a set of
politically oriented swarms expanded. In December 2010, after
WikiLeaks was cut off from receiving donations Operation Payback
refocused once again and disrupted the websites of MasterCard, Visa,
PayPal, and Bank of America. In January 2011, Anonymous refocused
again, attacking the websites of the Tunisian government. This
provided the bloggers in Tunisia with some sense of global solidarity
and, thanks to media attention Anonymous was focusing, also helped
to turn the international spotlight onto the beginnings of the Arab
Throughout 2011, the Anonymous swarms multiplied and innumerable calls
for action have been issued, some of them by attention seekers and
others hoping to profit from media frenzy. But this has not stopped
other swarms to attract people. On August 23, 2011 Anonymous released
a video calling for the occupation of Wall Street, taking up an idea
that the Canadian Adbusters Foundation had been promoting for a
couple of weeks.8 The involvement of Anonymous considerably raised
the profile of this idea and helped to move the dynamics towards the
tipping point where numerous independent initiative coalesced around
the proposed action, starting an open-ended occupation of Wall Street
on September 17, 2011.
Reaching the limits?
The outrageousness and flamboyance of Anonymous enables it us issue
slogans that are common sense to many -- like the aforementioned
equation of media piracy with freedom -- yet too radical anyone who
tries to be regarded as serious by the dominant powers, particularly
well-funded NGOs. This radicality galvanizes very significant, yet
latent energies where more measured b and breasonableb b statements
would receive lukewarm responses at best. This is contributing to
expanding again the scope of what can be debated in public, after
decades in which mainstream political discourse has narrowed to such a
degree that to even mention social inequality was viewed as in equal
measures old fashioned and outrageous.
Yet, for all the power of large scale, spontaneity this form of
organization cannot engage with the institutional world in any other
than destructive ways. At the moment, it cannot, and does not aim
at, building alternative institutions. It is, however, contributing
to the forging of a common, oppositional horizon that could make it
easier to coordinate further action. It has already hacked cracks
into many seemingly solid walls. To turn these cracks into something
constructive will be the tasks of others. But for now, Anonymous has
succeeded to expanded the space of the possible.

For the few years now there has been a particularly German obsession
with plagiarism in academic dissertations. Initially, this has been
employed to embarrass political figures and promote a self-righteous
discourse of academic pedantry, but it has also led to a distributed
infrastructure/community for checking unacknowledged sources in texts.
And now, this infrastructure is used for quite different purposes:
matching lobbying text to legal documents that are being drafted by
the EU.
While nobody can be surprised by the fact that lobbyists do shape
legislation, it's still revealing to this this nicely visualized and
connected to the names of the MPs who did the actual copy & pasting.
-> Tory MEPs 'copy and paste Amazon and Google lobbyist text'
Senior Conservative MEPs have been accused of cutting and pasting text  from lobbyists from Amazon, Google and other major online enterprises  directly into legal amendments to European Union legislation on consumer  data protection
The European Parliament is debating a new EU "general data protection  regulation" with important implications for how internet search engines  and online retailers handle users' personal information, including  sensitive health, background and credit details.
The legislation, proposed by the European Commission a year ago, is going through the EU assembly, which has the power to amend the law, triggering a huge lobbying campaign by the internet industry to change the regulations.
Campaigners for tighter privacy laws covering social media and online  retailers have published research at  showing close links between the wording of industry proposals and amendments tabled in the European Parliament's committees.
The campaigners have charted what they claim are "striking similarities  between proposed amendments and lobby papers written by representatives of Amazon, eBay, the American Chamber of Commerce and the European Banking Federation". "Dozens of amendments are being copied word-for-word from corporate lobby papers," they said.
Privacy campaigners are concerned that industry amendments tabled by MEPs will dilute legal requirements allowing companies to water down tough new rules on the processing of sensitive, personal information and loosening a requirement for mandatory data protection supervisors within businesses.
Malcolm Harbour, Conservative MEP for the West Midlands and chairman of  the parliament's committee on the internal market and consumer protection, which is overseeing the legislation, has been accused of copying over 25 per cent of his amendments from industry.
Research found that 14 out of 55 amendments tabled by Mr Harbour were  "copied directly from lobby papers", with the senior Tory also taking a  coordinating role in getting other MEPs, to table similar changes in other Sajjad Karim, Conservative MEP for the North West of England and a member of the parliament's committee on legal affairs, proposed amendments "with over 23 per cent copy-pasted content".
Another Tory, Giles Chichester, MEP for South West England and Gibraltar  and a member of the committee on industry, research and energy, followed  with "over 22 per cent copy-pasted content".
While there is no suggestion of wrongdoing or breaches of the parliament's rules, privacy campaigners fear that MEPs are listening to industry and not "We would hope that MEPs are taking all sides of the argument into account when making law, not just the richest and most powerful corporate interests," said Anna Fielder, a trustee of Privacy International.
Mr Harbour insisted that listening to industry, and privacy campaigners,  was part of the democratic process and "disputed" the 25 per cent figure  "Many of our points were aimed at making the regulation fit for small  enterprises, many of whom feel that their businesses would be threatened  by the costs generated from certain provisions in the original proposal.  That was why we modified a number of the detailed requirements," he said.
"I do not believe we should immediately discount proposed amendments when they come from businesses that make use of and are responsible for  protecting personal data. I will continue to consider all amendments on  the basis of their merits in making the proposal more workable."
Mr Karim and Mr Chichester declined to comment, but Conservative sources  said that they had followed Mr Harbour's lead in tabling amendments.
