Yes, and Germany.  There may be others.
They (the big 'they') tried this in Nevada several years ago, but stopped
after about 6 months.  It seems that the last picture a number of these
units took was of a pickup truck, license plate masked off, both driver
and passenger wearing ski masks, with the passenger weilding a baseball bat.
I guess it was pretty expensive.  ;-)
The ACLU was, at some point, challenging the practice of un-manned
units beaming radar at every car on the road, taking pictures of those
that were 'speeding'.
(who stands corrected, its 'CELP'.)

Along the same lines, I'm fairly sure that the NSA had a RFQ out for
much the same kind of thing.  (Key management on PCMCIA memory cards.)
