@_subject: For IP: Major UK Gov't Data loss 
All over the UK Media - but seemingly of limited general international  interest - but IP readers may be a special case!
(top story on BBC UK home page, but not on the World version)
Apparently the UK tax office has lost two disks (CD/DVD?) of 25  million "Child Benefit" users - names, DOBs and for many families bank  account details. In short the works. (Out of a UK population of ~60  million this is pretty impressive.)
As Child Benefit is a universal (non means-tested) benefit (in the  form of a cash refund for families with children) this means virtually  UK family with school age children is at risk.
Two password-protected discs CDROMs were apparently lost in the  internal "grid" mail (ie what seems to be the reusable internal mail  envelopes used by many enterprises)
Seems to be yet another combination failure of legacy systems, human  error in not following procedure(s) and some bad luck.
kind regards
 Paul
