@_subject: btw, the itu imploded 
The ITU didn't implode and that article gives a ridiculously misleading
impression of what happened.  The BBC gives a more balanced viewpoint:
There's some stuff up on some US news channels (ABC, etc), but some of the
larger players (CNN, NY Times + others) haven't actually woken up to the
extent of this tech/political landgrab, and have no recent articles on the
outcome or the political importance of it.
What actually happened is that the ITU ignored their previous promises not
to have a vote on the ITRs.  When a vote was finally called because it was
apparently that there was no general consensus on the articles, 77
countries voted in favour and 33 voted against, causing the treaty to start
the process of becoming legally binding in those countries which voted in
The current positions are here:
Many countries are formally sitting on the fence, including pretty much
every country in Europe which didn't walk out - also enjoy the spat in
declarations  (argentina) and  (UK).
Now that this landgrab has succeeded in large chunks of the world, the
ITU's position has consolidated, although not nearly to the extent that had
originally been envisaged in the draft ITRs.  I don't forsee this debate
dying any time soon.

cjdns is certainly an interesting approach, but its inventor doesn't appear
to understand:
- scaling issues
- point to multipoint networking
- that deterministic reachability is usually considered a good thing
- non-local connectivity lookup introduces hilarious denial of service
- the value of bitfield qos
- that the use of bEncoding for connectivity lookup is a degree or two
worse than using TLVs for the same means
- full independence from traditional ip protocols ("Router messages are
sent as normal UDP/IPv6 packets except that their UDP source and
destination port numbers are zero and the hop limit (TTL) field in the IPv6
header is set to zero.")
- that strictly symmetric routing is a bug, not a feature
- that 64 bits as a routing path mechanism is woefully insufficient for
modern networking
- that separation of control plane and data plane on a router is probably a
good idea
- throwing out the book on existing networking models is only valid if the
proposed replacement is measurably better
What's left in cjdns is a poorly specified mishmash of curious ideas which
will work fine on the author's playpen network and which will break
horribly on large networks, regardless of how hard the author waves the
"hey look at me, i'm having a revolution" flag.
