Believe me, the professionals have enough 0wned machines that this is
On the flipside, it means the machines are "burned" faster.
It's at least an order of magnitude higher than this, possibly 2 orders,
thanks to rampaging worms with spamware installation payloads
compromising cablemodem- and adsl- connected Windows machines worldwide.

This has already happened:
Krazy Kevin pulled this stunt 5 years ago on at least one list I was on,
joining the list to harvest the most common posters, then spamming using
them as sender envelopes after he'd been kicked off.
...discrimination against blind users - this is legally actionable in
several countries. There is a blind group in the UK taking action
against a number of companies for this and the Australian Olympic
committee ended up being fined several million AU$ for the same offence
in 1999.
To underscore that point, I've _watched_ cybercafes full of SE asians(*)
doing exactly this kind of thing for the princely sum of US$5/day -
twice the average wage of the area, even after the cafe fees were

Intelligence from DSBL indicated that there were _at least_ 350k
compromised machines in the USA Roadrunner network alone at one stage.
They are currently tracking around 1.5 million compromised machines.
The Swen and blaster worms install various spamware and backdoors. These
have been estimated to have infected millions of machines worldwide and
later versions removed characteristics which removed tellltale
compromise signs when scanned - now they mostly "phone home", instead of
listening for commands.
The pool of infected machines is huge. I just hope you're right about
the CPUs burning up - it doesn't happen when machines are running OGR
calculations, so I suspect that you just ran into a particularly badly
built example.
