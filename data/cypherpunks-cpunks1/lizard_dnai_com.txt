When the leftists try to avoid being called 'leftists', you know it's all over but the mopping up. But, nonetheless, let me try:
"A leftist is someone who advocates increasing government control over private actions, especially in the name of such mummeries as 'equality' and 'fairness'. Contrast to a rightist, who advocates increasing government control over private action in the name of 'decency' and 'values'."

Well, this isn't entirely true. Some of the loudest voices in banning/regulating crypto come from the left:Senator Lieberman, Senator Feinstein,Rep. Dellums, the Clinton Administration in general, etc. The fear of 'bomb making information' and 'terrorist militia groups' is almost entirely a left-wing fear, one about as realistic and plausible as the 60's John Birchers fear of 'Communist insurrection' behind every middle-class loser youth who grew his hair too long or waved around (but probably never read) Mao's Little Red

A fetus is not a human being. End of logic chain.
Proof:The defining characteristic of humanity is our recursive self-
awareness -- our ability to think and know we think. Consciousness, in other words. Consciousness exists as an emergent property of our immensely complex neural network. No neural network, no consciousness. No consciousness, no humanity.
A single cell is not conscious. It cannot be. It has no senses to receive information, no mind to process the information received. It cannot be considered human.
A newborn baby *is* conscious. Brainwaves from all parts of the brain register. It is human.
Therefore:At some point between conception and birth, the developing fetus crosses a line fron non-human (and thus, removable without any ethical worries whatsoever) to human (and thus, only removable under the normal conditions when it is proper to kill, such as a threat to the life of the host). This line can be defined by the beginning of detectable brain waves from the higher parts of the brain, which usually occur around the sixth month or so. At this point, consciousness -- and thus humanity -- has begun. It is only at this point that the fetus has become a rights-possessing organism.

could  could There is a difference, in that calling for the abolition of laws banning 'hate speech' can easily be labelled as 'hate speech' in themselves. Further, since it is never popular speech which needs government protection, the odds are good that the majority of those who would call for the abolition of such laws are those who wished to engage in such speech -- and thus, by calling attention to themselves, they could risk jail.
The reason such laws do not exist in the US is NOT because 'the people' do not want them -- I daresay a popular vote would install them in a heartbeat -- but because the government is NOT a democracy, and the 'will of the people' runs up against the Bill of Rights, which serves to protect people from the government, and from each While I'm sure there are at least some ideaological free speech absolutists in Germany, I'm betting they're a smaller group than they are even in the US -- Germany has no real history of free speech, compared to the US, and Europe in general has a history of placing the collective good ahead of individual liberty. While a US 'leftist' will, for the most part, cede the right of even his enemies to speak (this is changing lately, but it used to be true, and there's still a few old lefties about), my exposure to German and other European leftists indicates that they approve strongly of laws banning 'racist' or 'hateful' speech -- while the American left has its roots in the anarchists of the 19th century, the European left has grown from the totalitarians of the 20th century.

Sure. And that is, of course, the bottom line. But even if I was a rabid
national security freak, I'd *still* oppose key escrow, because it makes
the nation *less* secure. It's a loser on both liberty *and* security
grounds, and, since the liberty issue has already been conceded, the
(political) battleground is security. The "key escrow exposes us to spies"
meme has the capability to graft into the same mental reception points that
the "key escrow will save us from terrorists" meme is currently attached
to, much as 'blocker' viruses can prevent other viruses from infecting cells. If I were heading the NSA/CIA/FBI/etc, I'd be putting my budget into
getting ringers onto every BBS, every IRC channel, every 'warez' group,
every mailing list, everywhere, not wasting time on 'key escrow' when the
people I'd be most interested in tracking would never ever in a million
years turn their key over to the government. I'd be infiltrating,
subjerting, and getting keys the old fashined way -- by tricking people
into giving them to me. A key can be a gigabit in length and still be
cracked just by watching what someone types in to decode a message, and the
technology to do *that* is decades old, as are, sadly, the wiretap laws to
permit it. The "legitimate needs of law enforcement" are already far too
well served by existing holes shot in the Constitution -- there is no need
to make more, and doing so will defeat the putative aims of the hawks, as well.

No, it isn't. You end up being more concerned with being in the game than
with achieving your goals. Sometimes, you have to kick the board over.
I think it is more important to make the laws unenforceable (and make such
workarounds useful to the average netizen), than it is to try to keep the
government from passing laws. The work of people like Jim Ray and Phillip
Baker is crucial here.
The government is unlikely to pass laws to limit its own authority, on any
issue -- even those who might not want to use a particular power would
still want to keep it around 'just in case'. We cannot count on government to protect our freedoms. Therefore, we must
make it irrelevant to the exercise of those freedoms.
Not really, know. It's unlikely that a "Let's you and him fight" strategy
would prove effective, since this isn't just an interdepartmental turf
squabble. They will strip our freedoms first, and argue over who gets the
thumbscrews second.

No company, to my knowledge, is claiming a *right* to know things about me -- they may demand to know things about me as their half of a contract, but I'm free to refuse, or falsify.

It's not enough to have a great product -- you must also have great
marketing. In the case of memewar, you need to get people to want to use
something, enough to change their habits, even slightly. The less they need
to change, relative to the benefit they get, the better.
PGP/Eudora is a wonderful example of this. All that is needed to use it is
one extra step (after install) -- typing your passphrase to sign a message
before it is sent. Otherwise, it works the same as it always has. As a side
effect, you can right-click to encrypt any file you can see in Explorer.
Simple, quick, and usable even by the brain-dead, once you've convinced
them TO use it. (And I forgot to bring my key file to work, so my Eudora
here is useless for those purposes. Bother.)

 Rather, my position is that the system is ALREADY hopelessly corrupt and imbalanced;altering the letter of the law to say '20 years' as opposed to '10 years' FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE A CRIME AT ALL is irrelevant. The government can just as easily create two trumped-up ten year charges as it can one 20 year charge;'law' and 'justice' have nothing to do with one another anymore.
The whole concept of criminilizing the use of crpytography is offensive;the exact specifics -- 10 years or 20 years -- are pretty much the same.
Though, on second thought, there is a serious issue with it -- if, as we hope, encryption becomes widespread, than anyone doing anything will be using it;including 'in the commission of a crime'. This could make petty misdemeanors into 20 year federal crimes, and THAT is something to worry about. Hm.

But it doesn't have to decrypt it. It has to tell the cops:

I don't know why I keep making this point, but the weak point in crypto is NOT the length of the key, it's the human factor. Go after the HUMAN USING THE CRYPTO via traditional spy/police methods, and smeg the key length.
But to do that, you see, you'll need warrents, reasons for suspiscion, and, becuase of the effort involved, you'll only do it for serious crimes with a strong liklihood of conviction. *That* is the 'stauts quo' law enforcement *claims* to want.

I can't think of any other way. Each congressman has one concern:Getting re-elected. Thus, they frame each decision in terms of:"How will this sound in a 30 second TV commercial aimed at the clueless clods who live in my district/state?" and "Could this be exploited by my opponent in a similair commercial?" In order to convince a congresscritter to do what you want, you have to put it into those terms.
