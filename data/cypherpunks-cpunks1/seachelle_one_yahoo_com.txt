@_subject: CDR: beOutdoors spam scam exposed 
I know the beOutdoors spamming incedent is an old
issue, but I thought you might be interested in
reading this message I posted on n.a.n.e. Also, I got
the original lie they told mixed up, but please note
that no one was fired as a result. (The original
beOutdoors lie is at the bottom as a refresher.)
We have contacted our customer regarding your
"beoutdoors.com" spam complaint.  Below is their
explanation describing the
situation. Between Friday evening May 5, 2000 and Monday morning,
May 8, 2000 there was unauthorized use of beOutdoors
assets and its
Internet access that resulted in the sending of
unsolicited commercial email to an unknown number of
email addresses.  This
was done without any authorization or knowledge of any
company manager.
Specifically sometime Friday evening May 5 one of our
young technical employees (now ex-employee) and a
friend of his entered
the beOutdoors facility (without authorization) and
set up an email program on an internal server to send
our cash sweepstakes
announcement to email addresses contained on a CD the
employees friend had acquired.
We are unable to determine the number of emails sent
or to whom they were sent since three of our internal
servers crashed as
a result of the individuals unauthorized use.  Based
upon complaints we do know that many individuals
received several copies
of the email.
Due to the crash of our internal servers it has taken
us a little over a week to become fully operational
again and complete
our investigation to determine if there was criminal
intent.  After a discussion with the District
Attorney�s office and the
individuals who perpetrated the email disaster it
appears that there was no criminal intent just
misguided, unauthorized
actions by two very immature individuals.  The
employee was terminated but not prosecuted.
We want to apologize to Exodus and any others that may
have been impacted in anyway by the unauthorized
actions of a now
former employee.
