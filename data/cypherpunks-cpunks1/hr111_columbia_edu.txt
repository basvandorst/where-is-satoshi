@_subject: sources on steganography 
I am writing my dissertation on steganography. Basically I'm writing a
technical monograph that would be of use to undergraduate instructors.
What do you think are the best sources on steganography on
the Web? What about books other than Johnson, Katzenbeiser & Peticolas,
and the volumes covering the four international workshops on information
I am also interested in the history of the subject. One major problem with
the available sources covering the history (like Kahn) is that they
completely disregard China, India, and Arab countries. Any pointers?

Why would I be interested in "fool[ing] [you]." All I asked was for some
help with sources. If you cannot be of help, at least don't be a
hindrance. Besides, don't claim to speak for others. If envy is what
drives you, then I suggest that you work on that.

i guess my sense of humor was missed by most of you. i might have to
practice some more before going public unless i remain anonymous
(although it might be too late now).
