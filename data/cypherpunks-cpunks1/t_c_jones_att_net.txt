It's a question of trust.
The trust of the content owner in this case.
If the content owner is to trust the h/w (which has been called a varient of a media player elsewhere on this list) then it will require a signature from a trusted third party.
As has been noted before in the smart card case, trusted third parties need to know that the private key, for which they issue a cert, is well protected.  I believe we all agree that the best place to protect a private key is h/w.
If you want a cert from a 3rd party with that level of asertion, then YOU need to prove that YOU have provide that level of protection.  Both smart cards (see FINREAD specs.) and similar h/w can provide this level of protection.  (Pls note that I did not claim that all do, only that they can do it if they chose.)
