@_subject: Hey Paul Check Out This Watch 
I had a meeting to attend to, and I needed something classy yet professional to wear. One of my friends told me about your website and I've seen him wearing one of your watches, but I was still sceptical to buy a replica watch. I took my chance though, and ordered a Rolex from your website. When I received it, I was definitely impressed, but wasn't sure if my associates would be able to tell it's a replica. But when I showed up to the meeting, they couldn't take their eyes off of my new watch. This watch gave me what I was looking for, classy style, with a touch of professionalism. - Mark S., Just Visit
