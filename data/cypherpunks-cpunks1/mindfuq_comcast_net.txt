I somewhat agree here.. but probably on different grounds.  Such an
effort may be taxes well spent under the right circumstances, but if
the same people who would enforce spam who are also enforcing the
current telemarketing laws, it would be money wasted, because these
people are unmotivated.
I can't quite agree here.  I'm 100% for free speech, and if a spammer
wants to print a newspaper, I have no objection.  But if the spammer
wants to deliver this newspaper by walking into my home and dump a
stack of newspapers on my keyboard, we have problems.
There's a classic test to determine whether supressing an act is a
supression of free speech.  The test is to remove the speech, and
determine whether the aggrivated party still has a claim.  So in the
example above, would I still have a claim if someone broke into my
home and set a stack of blank paper on my keyboard?  I think so.  And
if the spam email had a space in place of each character, I believe I
would still have a claim because of the bandwidth and space consumed,
and my ability to sort through my inbox for legitimate mail would
still be hindered.
We need more law.  Example- I sue telemarketers on a regular basis
using the tort law written in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
This is practically a hobby for me now.  I have won every case, and
I've been well compensated for my troubles.  This is a great law,
because consumers who are motivated enough to play watchdog can be
compensated for their troubles.  The law is so beneficial, that I have
not added myself to the FCC's DNC list.
Also, I don't think it will be as difficult to define spam as people
on this list have suggested.  I have had no trouble showing the court
that the calls I received are "telemarketing" calls.  At the same
time, I think I would have difficulty showing that a call from a
friend, or family member, or enemy, was a telemarketing call, because
the TCPA states that intent must show intent to sell a product or
service, and to go with it there is a list of exclusions, like calls
from entities where you have an established relationship with (ie. an
account or previous transaction).  Legally defining spam would be an excersize that woud pay off.  Even
if such a definition left a grey area, spammers would be forced to
compose their messages to get into the grey area, and that would
either deter them completely, or make it easier for the user to
mechanize the sorting of the junk, because they would be more
constrained on how to write their messages.
I can't sue spammers though, because there is no tort law.  I can
really only sue for damages, which I would have to prove, and even
then it would be a grey area.  However, with the tort law written for
telemarketing, I don't need to show that there were any damages.. I
can automatically make a claim for $500 per violation.
I agree.. but again, for other reasons.  My personal email to friends
and family is blocked because these AOL idiots using a blacklist have
decided to blacklist all dynamic IP addresses.  I've never sent spam
in my life, and my legitimate mail is getting blocked by these
morons.  My strongest motivation is to sue MAPS, AOL, Sourceforge, and
all other not so bright ISPs who are blocking my speech, which is not
and never was spam.  I would join forces with spammers to sue these
people, because they're more damaging than spammers.
I don't follow you here.  What are you saying?  The role of the
government is to protect peoples rights, in which the ultimate vision
is happiness... but every law works in favor of some peoples happiness
and not others, so it's always a trade off.  But I see corporations
and companies as machines, not people, so in the interest of the
peoples persuit of happiness, the government needs to control these
machines.  My overall stance is the the government needs to put a tort
law in place so I can eagerly persue the happiness of suing spammers
(but only after suing the antispammers for blocking my legitimate
Sure it does.  If a majority of the population decides that spam is
immoral, then it only makes sense to align laws in persuit of the
happiness of the majority.  Isn't this the idea behind democracy?
No no no.. this is still a problem.  We don't "move on" until the
problem is resolved.  The technicians have tried and failed to stop
spam.  Time for the lawyers to take a crack at it.  I'm not a lawyer,
but I'm definately motivated to sue some spammers.  I'm only asking
that the government arm me with the tools I need.

We definately need a law making it illegal for an ISP to block
non-spam email.  I cannot email a friend who uses AOL, and wants to
receive my email, because AOL blocks it.  The only law out there to
protect me from this is a denial of service law, but it will be
difficult for me to argue that AOL is doing a DoS attack on me.  I
have no choice but to take actions under the DoS laws, but I would
much rather have a law that makes blocking legitimate communication a
What software are you talking about?  If it's the end user software, I
don't care, because if I cannot email a friend I can motivate them to
fix the problem.  But if you're talking about software that an ISP
would run, you're missing something.  AOL's software is falsely
blocking my email, and even though they could fix the problem, they
are not motivated because I'm a single user.  I've complained several
times.  They just ignore the complaint.  So software is a poor
solution if the people implementing the software are not motivated to
fix false positives.
Why would you say this?  It's not difficult to define spam.  You
simply list the charactoristics of spam, and then list exclusions to
ensure legitimate mail doesn't fit the definition.  This has working
beautifully for defining telemarketing phone calls.  There is not a
single math equation in the legal definition for "unsolicited
telemarketing call".  Even if there are imperfections in the
definition, people can at least be aware of the definition and make
sure that they aren't in the grey area.  If an email is in a grey
area, then the sender takes a risk by sending it.  But to argue that law should not address a particular issue because of
the difficulty of writing a definition is silly.  You just write the
definition such that the law doesn't target email that it doesn't
intend to target, and let go the fact that it may not target
everything we would like it to.
And to say that software can define spam better than laws written in
english is rediculous.  AOL blocks my personal email to a friend, and
I don't use a single spam phrase.  So it goes the other way too.. the
way software can define spam can get pretty stupid, I've seen it too
many times.
What do you mean by this?  One could argue that I'm using the TCPA as
a weapon against all these telemarketers I drag into court.  So what?
Most people see what I do as a service to the community.

My arguement was that you can't expect free speech to have absolute
protection.  There are many rights that are on the same level with
free speech, and if someone is going to use the free speech protection
in order to violate someone elses right, you're greatly
misunderstanding the purpose of free speech.  You need to study where
free speech came from and why.  People ideas should not be blocked.  No one objects to the speech or
expression that spammers create.  They can write all the spam they
want.  It's the *delivery* of that speech that we are objecting to.
If they deliver it in a nasty way, that violates other rights, then
that should be actionable.  The first amendment doesn't say anything
about the way in which you can deliver your speech.  Go stand on a
street corner for all I care, but don't enter my home and put it in my
face.. that kind of act should not be protected.  Your disagreement
with this puts you in the minority.
Spammers have the choice to make whatever speech they want, and I
don't intend to take that choice away from them.  But I will take
whatever actions necessary to ensure that they deliver it in a way
that is not intrusive.
This arguement boils down to an ad hominem, and it's empty with no
intellectual content.  Please explain what you mean here.  Give us an
academic argument with merit.

I should address this in more detail.  The privacy I have in my
livingroom is not because of doors and locks.  These don't stop those
who want to violate my privacy.  The law does, however.  It's more
important and effective to have breaking an entering laws than to have
these locks.  A six foot pry bar will get past most locks, but to get
past the law, they better have one hell of a lawyer (more difficult to
acquire than a pry bar).
This is the point Bruce Schneier made in a recent issue of Wired.
People are so focused on perimeter protection that they're completely
overlooking detection and *response*, and blocking legitimate access
at the same time.  Example- people who think technical solutions will
keep out the telemarketers and they buy all these privacy features for
their phone.  This doesn't stop telemarketers- they still get through.
But it does hinder family members, forcing them to go through hoops to
get to your voice.  But if you get wise and improve on your *reaction*
to telemarketing calls, you don't need the privacy features.  Remove
them, and welcome all callers as I do.  Default to trusting people, so
you don't distrust someone you should.  Then when one of the bastards
takes advantage, respond and make them accountable.  Sue them.
This philosophy doesn't work for everything, but it is the absolute
best tool for stopping telemarketing.  I don't block anyone I want to
talk to, yet I get compensated for the telemarketing calls.  And I'm
even able to do this w/out preventing the free speech right of the
telemarketer, because they were able to make their pitch.  If someone tried to take the tort law out of the TCPA, I would
probably sue them for violating my freedom of enterprise :)

Things got pretty twisted there in your response- let me unravel this:
* Jim Choate  [2003-08-02 18:04]:
This is a cop out.  Speak for yourself.  For all we know, you didn't
read this book.  Even if the book says it better than you could,
explain why you think I miss the purpose of law in a democracy.  If
you don't, your argument falls with it's own dead weight- one beauty
of free speech: ideas without merit fall, good ideas are carried as
far as they're worth.
No one has this right.  There is no inherent right to put stuff on
someones front porch.  And yes, to remove any doubt, I can put up a
sign making it clear that such an act is trespassing.  I don't know if people have a right to send me mail; but my argument
is that reguardless of whether they have this right, I should have a
private right of action to claim $500 per spam mail.  If they do have
such a right, then if anything it makes it even more necessary to have
tort laws against spam.
Exactly, and because I can take steps to make it clear that such an
act is trespassing, you do not have an inherent *right* to put stuff
on my porch.
It doesn't, mainly because this isn't a problem.
That's complete bullshit.  Trespass and harassment laws are
insufficient.  The point I was making with trespassing is that because
of trespassing law, you do not have a right to put things on my
porch.  Whether this law is effective is quite a different thing.  If
I go to the police station and say that someone is putting stuff on my
front porch even though I have all the proper notices posted, I will
get laughed out of the police station.  It's illegal and enforceable,
but that doesn't mean it will be enforced.  A very similar thing happened to me when I first started taking
actions against telemarketers.  I went to my local white collar crimes
unit to file a report against a telemarketer.  I had proof as to who
done it, what they did, and what laws were broken.  This was criminal
activity I was there to report, and they wouldn't even make a report.
Because the laws are broken so regularly, the police dept. is only
going to enforce the repeat offenders.  IOW, when I get three calls
from the same telemaketer, only then will they write a report.  And
even then, there's nothing to motivate them to act on the report.
So the mere presence of a law doesn't mean you rest assured that it
will do anything.  Tort law, on the other hand, is effective.  I'm
suing telemarketers left and right, because I am empowered to take
So no, my position does not back up yours.  My position is that we
need tort law, because trespassing law does not work.  I know that if
I post an appropriate use statement for my email box, and I get
spammed anyway, I will get laughed out of the police station for
trying to press trespassing charges.
We do need it, because I still get spam.  The laws in place aren't
working.  I need tort law, and nothing I've said indicates otherwise.
Not even close.  Until you support tort law, we will not agree on
this.  Ultimately, you could say my objective is to ask for more RIGHTS, not
RESTRICTIONS.  But rights also come in the form of law.  I'm not
asking for more restrictions on email.  I'm just asking for the
*right* to sue someone who sends spam.  Spam is damaging, and costly.
Let them send it (that way they can't complain about loss of free
speech), but I should have a right to seek compensation.  $500 per
email.  That's all I want.

I'm reading the design docs for MixMinion.  The authors are saying
that reply blocks must be single use because traffic analysis can be
done via flooding replay attacks, and that the replay block can be
derived from this.  I can see how this is the case with simple reply
blocks, but what about the reply blocks that have branching and

Right, the book may be an explanation of law and democracy- no one is
arguing that, but you're statement is a cop out, because you're not
willing to back your statements with a supporting arguement.  "Go read

you're trying to draw with your statement.
Then don't try to use someone elses book as your words.
This is relevent, because by not drawing connections necessary to

to believe that reading this book will add any support to your
Now this is irrelevant, because even if I couldn't read, my arguments
would still stand.  I could be blind, doesn't matter.
To point out an ad hominem attack is not an argument to begin with, so
there's no argument to weaken here.  It merely points out a fallacious
argument, if anything to help you, because your reader already
disposed of your ad hominem, and it already reflected poorly on you.
Consider it "help", FYI, for future reference.  There's no reason to
hold back a netettiquite lesson when one is due.  Everyone could smell the bullshit.  All I did was identify what kind
of bullshit it was and slapped a label on it for confirmation.  You
shouldn't consider ad hominems as a form of counter attack, or an
arguement that is weak or strong, but rather just feedback that your
argument in question failed to be effective.  Making an ad hominem
argument is just like making no argument at all.
Some people in forums have developed a way to embed ad hominems in
good intellectual content, but your ad hominems are coming out in a
pure form.  You should try to at least inject some intellect into your
ad hominems so we can all get something from them.  If you don't at
least do this much, you'll end up getting filtered out in peoples
procmail scripts.
So you have nothing to add to this?  An argument that goes unaddressed
is also an argument lost, so if you leave this alone, it will fail to
be effective, just as your ad hominem failed to be effective.
Again, you haven't made any sort of philosophical connection between
your unsupported comment and this book.  Basically, you copped out of
the argument.
No one said YOU had to agree with an idea for it to have merit.
The problem is that you're analyzing this from a bipolar perspective.
It's actually a fallacy to argue that there are only two sides to
something, and one must be the correct one.  This is what you're
implying by expecting a quick resolution.  Multiple competing ideas
often have merit.  Just because one perspective is a good one, does
not mean the competing ideas are worthless.  Because the idea of
absolute unequaled free speech is a good one, and ideas that limit
free speech also have merit and support from the greatest thinkers of
our time, you can't expect a quick resolution, despite the fact that
you can only see one side to this as being one with any strength.
Yes, as long as it doesn't interfere with other rights.  As soon as it
does, you can't expect all rights can win protection.
They don't have a right to contact me in certain ways.  ie. they don't
have a right to break my door down to make contact with me.  They may
have a right to contact me if they use a form of contact that doesn't
infringe on my rights.  And, correct, I don't have an inherent right
to be a hermit.  Your point?
Why would they warn against this?
What's your point here?
This is *exactly* what I'm advocating.  I want to have a private right
action against spammers, and I want that to be a protected right via
tort law.

I would almost agree with that, but in this particular case I don't
see how tort law restricts them from sending spam.  With a tort law
that gives me a right to claim $500 per spam, they can still send
spam, in fact, I might even welcome the spam.  But then it's only fair
to compensate me for my damages and troubles.  Heck, I might even buy
the product they're selling at the same time.
You've given up?
I'm not sure I agree with that.  Being outside of the U.S. would make
it more difficult for me to assert a claim, but not impossible.  I'm
no expert on this, but I believe there are lawsuits against overseas
companies, and I heard that countries basically trade
judgements.. ie. if we have $1 million in judgements against Canadian
companies, and vice versa, they enforce our judgements and in exchange
we enforce theirs.
I don't know about your numbers, but lets assume they're accurate.  I
would be happy with going after the locals, because I want to be
compensated whether it's someone in my country or otherwise.  So it
would be a good start to get compensation for internal spam- no reason
to ignore that.  In fact, considering all the spam I get, and figuring
that I can only handle a few lawsuits a week while maintaining my real
job, 15% of of your 50/day leaves 7.5 emails per day that are
actionable.  Not bad.  That's more than enough.  If I get $500 per
lawsuit, I would actually feel that the whole spam problem is
resolved, because it would be enough compensation to collectively not
care about the foreign spam.
If the 15% are eventually driven offshore, that's still an
improvement.  But in reality, a large chunk of that 15% will just stop
what they're doing.  Also, if their email originates offshore, but
they still live locally, I can still sue them, because their personal
jurisdiction is within my long-arms reach.  Relocating servers does
not get them off the hook.  If I'm in New York, then they are doing
business in New York under New York's jurisdiction, and that is where
the forum would be.  Enforcement of the judgement would be in the
jurisdiction of their person, or their assets.  So if that's Florida,
that is where the money will come from.  The legal system doesn't care
if their servers are in Vanuatu.  Sure it would be more difficult to trace them, but let's not deny the
private right of action for those with the resources and motivation to
make their claim.
No, it doesn't have to be this way.  A system of trust is a good one,
as long as there is accountability.  I love not having any privacy /
blocking features on my phone.  Anyone can call me, and family members
aren't blocked or screened.  They get my voice immediately.  Even
telemarketers are free to call me; but if they dare break the TCPA,
they will have to compensate me.  This is a great arrangement because
I don't need to barricade everything and fear blocking people I want
to talk to.  I don't have to pay my phone company for privacy
features, adding to their profits while they sell my number to the
telemarketers simultaneously.  And when a bad guy gets through, I get
compensated well enough not to care.  In fact, I even welcome
telemarketing calls.. muahaha!
And I must say, the corporations are failing with their technical
solutions.  This is not working.  Spam still gets through, and I don't
get compensated when this happens.  My legitimate mail gets blocked
because the filters don't work, and even worse, I don't get
compensated when that happens.  Private corporations are abusively
exercising their power to regulate who can email who, and the
collateral damage is ignored.  These private corporations need to be
removed from power.  They should not have this power.  If an entity
must have this power, it should be the government, but certainly not a
careless profit driven heavyweight.
Spamassassin works pretty well, but this is a user level tool, not
being used by ISPs.  I would use spamassassin in combination with tort
law.  This would be the best protection.
As it stands, the technicians are blocking my legit mail, and I want
to sue these people more than anything.  They are causing more damage
and frustration than the spammers.  I won't rest until MAPS and AOL
are removed from power.

I guess you'd have to define what you mean by 'success' in this case.
Clearly in terms of my own well-being, this activity is successful
because I get an opportunity to vent my frustrations, which is a very
good theraputic feeling, and I also get well compensated for my
trouble.  I feel pretty good about it.  I don't get raging pissed at
telemarkters anymore.  You'll have to support that claim somehow.
If it were my choice, such a company wouldn't have any customers.  But
hey, there's a sucker born every minute, and if these telemarketers
are going to seperate idiots from their money, fine by me.  The money
is better off in the hands of the company in this case.
I could always pull a republican comeback, and say that the money I
take from the community trickles back into the community :) But I'm
not a republican, so I can only say that the money funds my schooling
(and gambling, which in turn funds my schooling).
If I'm helping the telemarketing company as you claim, I wonder why
telemarketing companies don't excessively intentionally break the law
on a larger scale, and deliberately attempt to rack up the charges.
Hey, I could be a consultant, and advise telemarketing companies how
they can really rack up 1500 dollar lawsuits to really help their
business.  Really Jim, I guess I'm just failing to see how this is profitable to
the companies.  How do they profit from my lawsuits against them?
My winnings end up in my pocket, and I'm not exactly rich, so where
else is the money going Jim?  These companies?  How does such a cost
get passed on to the consumer?  Higher prices, you say?  If a company
can turn around and charge higher prices for their product or service
and stay in business, why didn't they do this in the first place?  Why
would it require a lawsuit to get the prices up?
Well, I'll tell you.  The fact is that the company is charging as much
as they can to begin with, because their goal is to maximize profits.
If they can turn around and start charging the customer more to
increase profits, there's no reason why my lawsuit was needed.  The
fact is, if the company has any sense, they're charging as much as
they can from day one.
So while my lawsuit doesn't increase the price to the consumer, it
does deter the company from harassing other consumers on the phone.
So it pays off for everyone.  Consumers get decent prices, and there's
no hidden cost for them to pay in the form of coping with harassing
phone calls.  This cost is removed, thanks to me :)

Yes, this is the problem I'm trying to address.  Normally when Alice
tries to transmit information to Bob, if Mallory decides to sabotage
the communication, this is a denial of service attack, forbidden by
criminal law.  However, if the communication passes through Mallory's back yard, we
can let the attack happen because it's on Mallory's property.  At the

also be held accountable for blocking communications.  This is what

There's a balance of rights, and obviously private property rights
aren't going to always get priority.  While they're high on my list in
*some* cases, they don't top human rights.  Some rights are a little
more fundamental and important than private property rights.  And when
someone abuses their property to damage someone else, I have zero
respect for their private property rights.  So I'm not at all
surprized that someone would perceive an inconsistency on this issue,
because there are so many more important rights that have a greater
bearing on peoples happiness.  AOL isn't even a human, so to put the private property rights of AOL
above the well-being of any human is a silly mistake.
In my particular case, AOL is blocking me from talking to friends and
family.  I suppose I could argue that the packets I create and send
are created with my private property and resources, so those packets
are my property, and AOL is vandalizing my property by destroying
these packets.  You can argue that how you want, but the bottom line
is that AOL is using their property to gain power to control who may
talk to who.  This is clearly an abusive use of property, and I have
no tolarance for it.  They need to be removed from power, and the
consumers who contributed to the purchasing of their property need to
be given some rights.
So if you're saying that AOL's private property rights are supporting
their effort to stop me from talking to my family, then of course I
have very little respect for private property rights.  I often see
people using their private property to cause damage to others, so it's
not real top on my list in these cases.

are my property, and AOL is vandalizing my property by destroying
these packets.  You can argue that how you want, but the bottom line
is that AOL is using their property to gain power to control who may
talk to who.  This is clearly an abusive use of property, and I have
no tolarance for it.  They need to be removed from power, and the
consumers who contributed to the purchasing of their property need to
be given some rights.
So if you're saying that AOL's private property rights are supporting
their effort to stop me from talking to my family, then of course I
have very little respect for private property rights.  I often see
people using their private property to cause damage to others, so it's
not real top on my list in these cases.

Unfortunately, you're correct.
Yes, this is the problem I'm trying to address.  Normally when Alice
tries to transmit information to Bob, if Mallory decides to sabotage
the communication, this is a denial of service attack, forbidden by
criminal law.  However, if the communication passes through Mallory's back yard, we
can let the attack happen because it's on Mallory's property.  At the
same time, if I sabotage the city water line that passes through my
property, I can be held accountable.  And rightly so.  Mallory should
also be held accountable for blocking communications.  This is what
needs to change.
There's a balance of rights, and obviously private property rights
aren't going to always get priority.  While they're high on my list in
*some* cases, they don't top human rights.  Some rights are a little
more fundamental and important than private property rights.  And when
someone abuses their property to damage someone else, I have zero
respect for their private property rights.  So I'm not at all
surprized that someone would perceive an inconsistency on this issue,
because there are so many more important rights that have a greater
bearing on peoples happiness.  AOL isn't even a human, so to put the private property rights of AOL
above the well-being of any human is a silly mistake.
In my particular case, AOL is blocking me from talking to friends and
family.  I suppose I could argue that the packets I create and send
are created with my private property and resources, so those packets
are my property, and AOL is vandalizing my property by destroying
these packets.  You can argue that how you want, but the bottom line

I can think of hundreds of reasons DoS attacks are illegal.  Now I'm
not sure if it's illegal everywhere; I'm only familar with the way
it's written in the California Penal code, which is where Mallory is
located in this case.  But to answer your question, just look at all
the damage that's caused by DoS attacks.  Look at the Slammer worm.
It would be a seriously neglectful to allow such damaging attacks on
people and businesses.
First of all, Bob was coerced into this contract because Bob had no
idea that the fine print said there may be cases where he doesn't get
the service he thinks he's paying for.  Specifically, Mallory didn't
tell Bob that she would be filtering his mail for him, and certainly
didn't tell Bob that she would take the liberty of blocking some
non-spam mail as well.  Such a contract is quite questionable, and I'd
like to see it put before a court for fair analysis.
The problem with this argument is that Mallory is not just denying
service to Bob, but Alice as well.  Furthermore, Alice may not even
have the option of explaining the service problem to Bob, because
Mallory is preventing Alice from talking to Bob.
Mallory is everyone's business, because a malicious attack on the
Internet affects everyone.  The fact that Bob is paying Mallory money
doesn't make it okay- in fact, it worsens the problem, because the
perpetrator is being compensated by her own victims.
Such a contract is predatory, and has no business in this country.  It
prays on ignorant users, and provides a false representation for what
the user is signing up for.  FYI- you can't put anything you want in
fine print, and expect it to be legally enforceable.  Even if two
parties agree that an illegal activity is okay, this does not legalize
the activity.
This is just what I said.  You're making my point here.  Absolutely, I
cannot sabotage the city water line that goes through my property.
No contract necessary; criminal law is enforceable w/out a contract.
Even more so, actually, because there is no chance of a contract
removing the effect of Alice's claim.
Certainly not- there is no superceding free speech right or anything
of the kind that would entail stealing a stapler.  Blocking email,
OTOH, violates multiple rights: free speech, right to assemble and
petition the government, freedom of enterprise.. it could even run
into public safety issues.  So this stapler analogy doesn't really
work here.
While I have gotten all but one friend and all family members to drop
their AOL/Earthlink services, this still remains an issue for users
whome I don't know personally.
I didn't do this, I created them- AOL is the one destroying things.
I'm the aaahteeest, the creator.. AOL is the destroyer, using their
property destructively.
Like I said, DoS laws don't require there to be a contract between
Alice and Mallory.  In fact, it *usually* is the case that Mallory and
Alice have no contract.  If you do a ping of death attack on
victim.com, do you actually think that absense of a contract between
you and victim.com gives you the right to do this?  Absurd.  Contract
or not, DoS attacks are illegal.  If Bob signs a contract with Mallory allowing Mallory to do a DoS
attack on him, he's the only one who may not be able to take action.
But the state can still take action, as well as other victims who
didn't sign their rights away (Alice, for example).
It's quite reasonable to expect corporations to abide by all laws in
their jurisdiction.
Ad hominem.  It's natural to get frustrated when your words don't
carry much weight, but this only decreases your credibility.  You just
need to work on better angles, and find better ways to illustrate the
points you're trying to support.
Even I could come up with a better argument against myself than this
worthless argument you present.  Need some help?  You might argue that
AOL's property rights are sacred, and above all other rights.  You
might challenge me to produce an example of private property being
used to damage others.  You could argue that it doesn't matter who
gave AOL the money to buy their property, it's theirs regardless.
Just pick one.  The only idiot here is you if you can only produce an
ad hominem.  You need to work on that.

This is exactly what you asked- just read the quote.
I answered this several times already.  Listen up.  Getting people to
sign a contract excusing illegal activity does not make that activity
legal.  If it did, you would see drug dealers asking their customers
to sign contracts stating that they're not to be held accountable.
People cannot agree via contract to violate a law, then expect to be
able to enforce such a contract.  This is a concept you need to
acquire.  Contracts are not enforceable simply because there was an
agreement.  There is other criteria that must be adhered to, one of
which is law.
And?  It certainly doesn't matter to me whether we define these bozos
as a "common carrier."  What does matter is that they have a large
piece of the market share, and their illegal practices have a
significant impact on the internet community.
This is just a restatement.  I already explained that this is a
predatory and misleading contract.  If you don't accept this, then you
must make an argument to the contrary.  You would have a difficult
time arguing that AOL users are aware of the TOS.  Not a single AOLer
who I convinced to leave AOL was aware of the AOL TOS.
Care to support that statement with anything?
This is because Bob isn't a real person.  Bob is a hypothetical
character used to analyze security threats and activities, and Bob
lives in a hypothetical world.  So to summons Bob to this forum is
quite a silly idea.  You'll have for find a better way of making your
point.  Why would Bob be motivated to check these pages, when Bob doesn't even
know there's a problem?  Remember, Bob is ignorant here; as Bob is not
informed that legitimate mail with his name on it is being trashed.
These quotes only prove my point that the contract is predatory.
Again, you made my point for me.
Predatory- my point exactly.  Again, you have made my case.
Bob did not give his *informed* consent to these terms, only his
Again, this is just a restatement of what you already said, and it
does not address my statement.  Companies do not exist in an isolated
vacuum with their customers.  They affect others- people who have
absolutely no contract with them.  Does this lack of contract make the
company immune to legal liabilities?  Not at all.  I sue telemarketers
on a regular basis, and I win, and collect.  I have absolutely no
contract or business relationship with these companies, but they still
manage to cause me damage, and they must deal with me when I serve
them with court papers.  In fact, if I did have a business
relationship with these companies, it would weaken my case, because
the law allows companies to telemarket their own customers.  So this
argument that I must be paying them money in order for them to be able
to damage me is absurd.
This isn't necessary.
Correct, Bob's contract with AOL does not involve me.  What I'm
talking about is AOL committing a DoS attack on me, which is
actionable regardless of Bob's contract.
The Internet doesn't have to be a "legal entity" for it to be
attacked, and have an impact on society.  Take the Slammer worm, for
example.  This thing attacked the Internet and had a huge impact on
Internet users.  If you try to explain to these users that they don't
have a claim against the attacker because the Internet is not a "legal
entity" by your terms, you'll have a very unconvincing point.  The
internet can be attacked, we've seen this.
Again, no one is arguing that AOL isn't playing by these rules that
they created.  However, AOL must still abide by the law.  And yes, I
see your restatement that I don't have a contract with AOL.  This
statement isn't effective.  It doesn't matter that I don't have a
contract with AOL.
Again, there's this constant ineffective restatement that you make.  I
don't need to have a contract with AOL to press charges against them.
This argument suffers from the Straw Man fallacy.  You're
misrepresenting my argument, then attacking the misrepresentation.
Again, I agree with the fact that I cannot sabotage the city water
line.  But here inlies a flaw in the way you approach these problems.
You then state that I can't sabotage the water line because I have
some kind of contract with the city or water company.  This is not the
reason.  This idea that you can only make a claim against someone you
have a contract with is bogus.  What if someone who has no contract
with anyone in my state enters my property and destroys the water
main- they can still be held accountable, even without a contract.
This is the concept you are missing.
Denial of service crime, located where the servers are.
Straw man fallacy.  Attack my statements, not your distorted
re-presented versions of them.
The state must protect my freedom of speech.  So when I make a claim
against AOL for conducting a DoS attack against me, the state must
rule in my favor, or else they are failing to protect my free speech
rights.  There's your repeated ineffictive argument we keep seeing.  I've shown
that I do have a valid claim against AOL, and it seems you can't argue
this without the restatement fallacy.
They can only do this if they can show libel.  However, showing AOL
users the very contract they agreed to can't really be considered libel.
I did not know AOL would destroy my packets.  I sent them fully
expecting them to arrive in the recipients inbox, and found that AOL
took an action against it.  This is how I discovered the problem to
begin with.
My ISPs contract does not state that they would blacklist my IP
address, so I have a claim there as well, but that wasn't the point of
this thread.
What I suggest to you is that you take a class in your local
university on argumentation theory 101.  Most of what you say has no
effect because it has one logical fallacy or another.  Study these
fallacies before posting; you'll find that you have to scrap most of
what you say before hitting send.

You're close.. If Bob sends a message that meets the (yet to be
created) legal criteria for spam AND Alice thinks it is spam...
I'm not saying she has this right, I'm saying she *should*.
Correct.  However, the intent of denial of service laws is arguable
and not concrete, so I would add a clause to the law which
specifically includes denial of service on the part of the carrier to
remove any doubt.  This needs to happen because ISPs are not being
held accountable for their denial of service actions.
The problem with this argument is that Alice unwittingly hires her ISP
not knowing that her ISP will deny service.  Because she is not fully
informed, she cannot be held accountable.  Example- You hire a
professional moving crew to move a warehouse full of cocain, but you
don't disclose to them the contents of the crates.  It would be
unreasonable to press charges against the moving company who didn't
know what they were moving.
Also, this argument you make is somewhat of a straw man, because I
really wouldn't have a problem with an ISP discarding "obvious spam."
The reason I would be okay with that is that when I email a friend
with a personal message, the ISP would have a difficult time showing
that such an email is "obvious spam."
You have to take a step back and look at the EFF's philosophy, which I
hold in high esteem.  That is, spam blocking is okay if and only if
legitimate mail is not denied.
First of all, my philosophy is completely aligned with that of the
EFF.  The only difference from your post would be the presence of a
"proper reject message".  The EFF does not agree with blocking
legitimate email EVEN WITH A PROPER REJECT MESSAGE, nor do I.  Now I
would argue that without a proper reject message damages are
substantially higher, and so the ISPs liability should also be higher,
but reject message or not, blocking legit email is a problem.
Market solutions are failing in this case, and that is the very
problem we're discussing.  These ISPs don't empower the user with the
spam blocking control.  What's worse than that- they don't tell the
user what they are doing, and the user is not fully informed of the
consequences.  Even worse, when my mother did become fully informed,
she told Earthlink to stop blocking my email, and they refused.
I can understand being attached to this 'free market' concept, it's
American to be that way.  But to embrace it as a perfect
self-regulating model is giving it far too much credit.  There are
imperfections, some of which are gross imperfections, and there needs
to be government influence in these areas.
You're confused about who's bugging who.  It starts with the spammers.
The spammers bug the ISPs, and their customers, who in turn bug their
ISP.  Then the ISP responds by implementing a poor spam blocking
scheme because it's cheap and the best thing for profits.  This bugs
the civil libertarian Linux/sendmail users, because now their mail is
bouncing.  At this point, the linux/sendmail users are at the
receiving end.  The ISP is not bugged by this group because it's a
small group and so their profit driven approach says that these users
can be ignored.
So the best way to fix this in a free market is to create a new right
that gives users who are unreasonably denied service a right to claim
$500 per denial (unreasonable in this case means blocking of obvious
non-spam).  Then it's still a free market, and ISPs are still free to
block whatever they want, but it will get too expensive for them if
they don't adopt smarter filters.  However, that would be their
choice, and it wouldn't matter to me which they choose, because even
if they block my email, I would be compensated sufficiently enough to
justify the loss.
