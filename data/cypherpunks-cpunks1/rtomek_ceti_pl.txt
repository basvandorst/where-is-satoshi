I think "moderate" is the right choice of a word. Not sure how moderate you want to go in your moderating, how about removing wifi (it's on PCIe card, AFAIK), or, say, crushing BT with heavy pincers? No, I cannot recomend anything like this, I didn't allow pincers into my laptop...
I have recently tried a few Debian-related distros on my X61 (which seems to be smaller brother of X60, i.e. lots of shared hw AFAIK). Ubuntu and Mint boot and work o-o-t-box. Those were just for testing :-/, Debian works too, with X and sound (not sure if I used sound under Debian). FreeBSD - for some reason I am always between after-install and comfortable-using it, at least on laptops and desktops, which is where I tried it so far. Booted it few times into console, X doesn't work on X61, for me.
Seconded, for the pros you gave. I'd consider recompiling kernel. Debian does not have the most recently updated hot-fancy-pansy software, other than security updates - but even in this case, I'd say priority is to backport patch into version included in one's current Debian distribution. So soft is acceptably new when I dist-upgrade but as months go by, it gets a bit old. OTOH, during my circa 15 years of using it, I rarely felt bad about not having the latest version of something installed. With some exceptions, like browsers, java and mplayer, but see below. Most of the other soft I use is stable enough to not undergo revolutionary changes. And besides, I don't really want to be surprised by a bug which took a free ride on top of some revolutionary change.
One huge pro, so far, is that Debian does not push its choice of window manager down my throat. I use fvwm and I want it to stay so (after extensive periods of gnome and kde, so I guess they lack something). For a laptop, I would either use a console with screen or maybe some mouseless WM - there is plenty to choose from (try to befriend aptitude and apt-* tools). The default in newer distro is some lightweight decently looking kde-replacement, forgot its name, should be good for noncomputing parents/spouses/siblings (children would use Android/iOS anyway).
Another good pro is ability to download full source code (about 7-8 dvds, security updates put onto separate disc) and compile it while in places without easy net access. At least I assume it would work. This pro is of course shared by some other OSes, too. In case of Debian, however, I guess it's safe to assume that all sources fit nicely with each other, compile without complaining, so once you got full copy it is all that you will need. This theory I am yet to test - I know this all compiles on devel's cluster but I think I should test before I claim anything more.
As of patching packages, I don't do it because I never had such need. Albeit I tinkered a bit with them when I decided to backport some new packages into my oldie distro. Tools for this are rather easy to use, but from time to time one has to modify some file so the new stuff compiles with older lib etc. Sometimes, such backporting turns into recursive backporting which is why emacs is one of the compiler's helper tools :-).
When I want newer version of something, I use stow for stuff going into to install into /opt/{specific_dir}. Thus the core of my sys remains stable and pure, like the devs meant it to be. Stuff from /usr/local is on standard PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so it is more integrated into usual sys works. Stuff from /opt I use by adding apropriate dirs into ENV variables. Thus I can easily switch between various versions - or revert to stable defaults when I have to.
And last but not least, there are third party repositories (chrome, opera, backports, marillat and some more) which offer latest versions and work with one's current distro. Those are easy to add - just a line or two in A some kind of cons is this: after many many many years and many dist-upgrades, so much cruft is collected in /etc (mostly, my mods to config files, backups of mods and origs, some custom scripts residing in installing from a scratch. Other than this, I consider my current os to be twelve years old and counting :-). Perhaps it's time to put /etc into some kind of version control regime. Longevity has its own share of strange problems and strange solutions - not that I am against longevity.
Sooner or later you will want to compile, so don't worry. I'd have still used Debian, with Slackware or Gentoo being strong secondary choices. But I don't have significant experience with those, so I can't recommend.
Yep. Debian, at least, is quite well documented. dwww is my tried old friend. It's possible to install books and manuals from additional packages, those integrate nicely into dwww and can later be accessed with a browser. dwww includes manpages and infopages into this common browsable interface, too, very very cute.
But if you desire a lot to go exotic way, you may have a look at this:
I didn't try it. But it looks interesting. Maybe it's worth a try.

How a smart meter knows what I'm watching
   Posted on [32]January 15, 2013 by [33]Menno van Doorn
   Last   year   Researchers   of  from  M|nster  University  of  Applied
   Sciences demonstrated  that  consumers  can be identified via the data
   collected by  a  smart meter, from the types and amount of devices, TV
   shows  being watched  and  scan  for  copyright-protected (or pirated)
   movies.  If  you want  to  see  how  they  predict  what movie you are
   watching, based on
   data  form  your  smart  meter,  start  at   approx 14:40 minutes. The
   video is called "Smart Hacking For Privacy"
   IFRAME: [34]
   The  brightness  of  the  backlight  influences  the  energy  use  and
   is refelcted  in  the  data  that go to the smart meter. The fact that
   smart meters  collect  data every two seconds makes it possible to get
   very accurate  graphs.  That's how they are able to recognize patterns
   in
   energy use and compare with patterns in a movie database.
   What's    your    opinion?    Should    we    keep    these    Privacy
   Intrusive Technologies out of our homes? Or should we fix the problems
   with Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies? Here's what I think. Fix it: we
   need a smarter grid.
