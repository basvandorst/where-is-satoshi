full text from: NSA eavesdropping program ruled unconstitutionalJudge orders
immediate halt to program
DETROIT, Michigan (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Thursday that the
government's warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and
ordered an immediate halt to it.
U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor in Detroit became the first
judge to strike down the National Security Agency's program, which
she says violates the rights to free speech and privacy.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of
journalists, scholars and lawyers who say the program has made it
difficult for them to do their jobs. They believe many of their
overseas contacts are likely targets of the program, which involves
secretly taping conversations between people in the U.S. and people
in other countries.
The government argued that the program is well within the president's
authority, but said proving that would require revealing state secrets.
The ACLU said the state-secrets argument was irrelevant because the
Bush administration already had publicly revealed enough information
about the program for Taylor to rule.
