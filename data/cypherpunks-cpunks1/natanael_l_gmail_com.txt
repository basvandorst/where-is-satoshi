This is precisely how I2P eepsites work. The true addresses are [52
characters of b32 encoded checksum of public key].b32.i2p while the
hosts.txt file is a list of these with their readable [sitename].i2p
domains. You can modify your own lists as you wish.
I2P Messenger and Bote mail could be combined to do what you suggest. :)

and are available in an email like interface, so that instant messaging and
email are variant user interfaces on the same function.
