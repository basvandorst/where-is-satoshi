@_subject: hello 
hey there.  I just joined the group about a week ago and have held off writting, until I sort of got a feel
 for what goes on.  I still don't think I have the feel for it , but what the hell I'm writting anyway.
 If it is possible is there anyone who could take a little time to give  me a few hints on how to send, receive, and forward encyrpted messages.  any help at all would be appreciated.

please remove me from the list.  There is still TOO
much traffic to read.
