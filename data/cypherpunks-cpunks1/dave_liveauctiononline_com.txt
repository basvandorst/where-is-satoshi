Hi :)
We are looking for a limited number of reputable online companies who are interested in using our online auction to sell their products. We think that we can work together to help each other promote our on-line store-fronts. We would like you to become an "Anchor Tenant" at L.A.O.,  here is how it works:
- We will place "Your Banner" in a  category that  matches the type of items that you sell. - Bidders access "only your" items by clicking on "Your Banner". - You guarantee to keep a minimum of 100 auctions running at L.A.O.
- You provide a reciprocal link from your site to ours.
- NO LISTING FEE, you only pay a small % only on the items that sell.
What are the benefits:
Exposure - we place only "Your Banner" in the Your Category.
Exposure - we link "Your Banner" to your web site!!
Exposure - only "your auctions" are featured in your selected Category.
Live Auction Online is currently getting over 1,000,000 hits a month and we have close to 10,000 members. Please let us know as soon as possible, we have a limited number of categories and we will only place 1 Banner in each category!!

Also, please send your website address and aprox. hits you are recieving if you have advertising on your site.
