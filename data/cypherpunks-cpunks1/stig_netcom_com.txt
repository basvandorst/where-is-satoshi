that's vulnerable...it's the secret key problem.  The ELEGANT way to do
this with encription is to just make a normal ZIP file, but then build
diffie-hellman into your file downloader (zmodem).  This is also the least
work solution.
SO, since we're talking about offline mail readers...  Whats the best one
for the PC that works (or can easily be made to work) with rfc822 mail
files?  There's pcelm, which sucks...and there's mush, which is slooooow
as hell because of all the overlays.  I was writing my own, but I got
side-tracked...somebody want to save me some programming?

Not that I'm exactly of godlike hacking proportions, but these are obvious
to me....  also, there's no such thing as a dumb question, but it's not terribly
difficult to ask questions in the wrong place and,thereby, waste other
people's time and piss them off.  Your question isn't terribly appropriate
to the cypherpunks list and it's so amazingly general that you won't get
anything but a general answer.
the most important thing about being a hacker is working with other
hackers.  Despite common misperceptions, hacking is a social thing.

@_subject: Software infrastructure 
To quote: Eric Hughes Let's generalize a bit:  Since PC based unix is more available, this
package should run on either PC or UNIX platforms.  Tip doesn't cut it
as a terminal program for UNIX and I don't know of another...  SLIP
has it's disadvantages.  So, what I'm proposing is that the OS interface stuff be crammed into
an interface layer.
One intriguing application:  Write an interface layer that uses
SOCKETS for connectivity.
We want to avoid the kitchen sink mentality, BUT if we're going to
spend lots of time on this package, then why have it all go to waste
when time comes to port the sucker?

@_subject: HELP: pgp, .forward, mh 
To quote: Karl Barrus Regarding: HELP: pgp, .forward, mh
The problem is that when sendmail executes your filter, your
environment is all messed up.  HOME and USER aren't even initialized.
PATH is probably /bin:/usr/bin.
This works when you send mail to yourself because your environment
gets passed along to your mail filter.
Here's a good wrapper script to use ....
export HOME PATH PGPPATH
cd $HOME
exec >> $HOME/Inbox/FILTERLOG 2>&1	# this logs error messages so
touch $FF
chmod 600 $FF
(tee $FF; echo '') >> Inbox/everything	# this saves your mail in case
PGP COMMAND GOES HERE
rm $FF

@_subject: Trimmed down pgp.hlp 
I edited down the pgp.hlp file so that it's more readable (for me anyway).
In case you think that the help file is less than helpful, just replace it.
PGP maintainers:  please add this (or an even more concise version) to the
pgp distribution...contrib directory is fine.
Here's a quick summary of PGP v2.2 commands.
pgp ciphertextfile [-o plaintextfile]		decrypt or verify signature
pgp -e textfile her_userid			encrypt file w/ pubkey
pgp -e textfile userid1 userid2 userid3		multiple recipients
pgp -s textfile [-u your_userid]		sign plaintext file
pgp -es textfile her_userid [-u your_userid]	sign, then encrypt
pgp -c textfile			traditional symmetric cipher only
KEY MANAGEMENT:
pgp -kg				generate your own unique key pair
pgp -ka keyfile [keyring]	add new key(s) to your keyrings	
pgp -kx userid keyfile [keyring]	extract (copy) a key from a keyring
pgp -kxa userid keyfile [keyring]	same, except it's ascii
pgp -kv[v] [userid] [keyring] 	view the contents of your public ring
pgp -kvc [userid] [keyring]	view the "fingerprint" of a public key
pgp -kc [userid] [keyring] 	check signatures of public keys
pgp -ke userid [keyring]	edit userid/pass-phrase for your keypair
pgp -ke userid [keyring]	edit the trust parameters for a public key
pgp -kr userid [keyring]	remove a key (or userid) from your pubring
pgp -ks her_userid [-u your_userid] [keyring]	sign/certify a public key
pgp -krs userid [keyring]	remove selected signatures from a pubkey
pgp -kd your_userid		revoke your key & issue compromise certificate
pgp -kd userid			disable or reenable a key on your pubring
ESOTERIC USAGES:
pgp -d ciphertextfile		decrypt message and leave its signature pgp -sb textfile [-u your_userid]	create signature separate from textfile
pgp -b ciphertextfile		detach signature from a signed message
OTHER FLAGS

@_subject: PGP:  Environment protection for UNIX 
Phil & Cypherpunks:
Here's a little program that demostrates a fairly simple way to immprove pgp
security on multi-user systems....
It deletes from it's own environment any environment variable that
begins with the string "PGP".  It ain't bullet-proof but just by
grepping the environment of netcom, I've identified several PGP users:
This hack would prevent that...  'Course for UNIX, PGPPATH should
default to $HOME/.pgp anyway.

And I should've enclosed it in  STUPID ...   I misread
the putenv(3) man page and didn't realize that you could just use To wipe those variables out of your environment...  They still might
get caught by a 'ps -eaxuww' but chances are slim.  Is it posible to
alter your arguments so they're not visible to 'ps -auxww'?
Well as a matter of fact, it does seems to work on my sparcstation:
        main (int argn, char **argv, char **envv)
        {
            system("ps -uww");
            for (;*argv;++argv) {
                while (**argv) {
                    *(*argv)++ = ' ';
                } /* end of while */
            } /* end of for */
            puts("--------------------------------");
            system("ps -uww");
        }
Not elegant, but that's what makes it a GLP (grungy little program).
So, is there a more elegant way to do this?  How portable is it?
Finally, of how much use is it?

Yeah, I like that too...  'cept if you need to pass args, it doesn't
provide a covert channel.
I confess to not having read my PGP manuals yet, but is there an
interactive mode to PGP?  If there WERE (hint), then it could be run
as a subprocess of emacs or a mail program and thus be a) more
convenient and b) the whole hub-bub about people snooping your
environment would be a non-issue.
