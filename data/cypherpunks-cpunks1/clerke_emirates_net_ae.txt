@_subject: Is there a freeware knockoff of SSH for win95 
I'm using the ssh32 client (updated last month) by Cedomir Igaly
(c.igaly at doc.ic.ac.uk) under win NT4 and forwarding the http  (and mail and
news) packets. It's working like a charm.
There's a recent 16bit version as well. Mail: Wayne Clerke
