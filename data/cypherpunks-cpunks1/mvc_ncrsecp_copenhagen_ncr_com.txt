@_subject: Paranoia and the Outlawing of Cash 
In Denmark practically everybody has a 'DAN-card', a card with which all purchaces, no matter how small, can be charged directly to one's bank account. There is no charge for using or having the card, and it can be used practically everywhere. If for some reason you still want cash, there are plenty of ATMs around.
This means that the banks and the government know pretty much how much each of us spends on everything, but that's ok since we all trust the banks and the government  :-( .
When are we going to get real and untracable (!) electronic money ?
