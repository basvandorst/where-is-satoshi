[ explaination of method deleted ]
I like this method you mentioned of
using two keys, on one on the public machine, and one more secure at home
or whatever.
I meant to comment on this before...I'm not sure about the "detached"
signature, though.  What if someone created a detached signature, adds it
to their header, and the last thing that happens is that their mailer
appends their .signature to the end of the message.  The only way seems to
be to say, "Encorporate the detached signature mechanism into whatever
program you're using so that it's the last thing that happens.  This
includes things like mailx, elm, and inews."  Not everyone could probably
comply with this (especially some who work for corporations that add a
corporate signature to messages after it's left the user's hands).

OK...Ophir has put this file on ftp.tamu.edu, and I moved it to a suitable
I put it in   ftp://ftp.tamu.edu/pub/documents/atmtutor.txt.gz
(and we're using the wuarchive ftpd, so it can be
 retreived uncompressed by leaving off the ".gz")

@_subject: REQUEST: PGP Lib status 
A while back, whenever someone talked about perhaps working on
libraritizing PGP themselves, the reply would be "someone's working on it," or "it will be in the next release."
Anyone have the current status of this?

@_subject: Patent infringement (fwd) 
^^^^^^ (as long as WE code it that way)
Especially when considering those not in the United States...RSA patent
(however valid/invalid) need not apply; and you're not (necessarily)
contributing to "inducement" since that's what's necessary to communicate
with those out of the country.
Like (m)any of us can make an official statement on that.

@_subject: Al Gore's home page 
Yep..."Never attribute to malice..." and all that.
It looks like the work of a "Kristian 'Kris' Chubb", rather than Al Gore,
but check out:
  it's got several pictures of Gore (sitting at a computer with his ultra
serious expression, no less), and a voice intro by him.
