I did a distributed scheme for something else that had two levels, a master
and a group of slaves.  Only the slaves talked to the master.  For this effort I think a variation of the idea would be better.  Have all of the
brutes contact the master, who will, in the first transaction assign them
to the next slave in a round-robin fashion.  Then all of the transactions
from that point would take place between the brute and the slave:)  (Sounds
kind of like Conan or the Princess Bride.)
The slaves would each be delegated large chunks of the keyspace, but not
keyspace/numslaves.  Maybe 1/16th or something like that, and could ask for
more when their space was depleted.  Periodically, perhaps when requesting
more key space, and/or when a timer pops, the slaves could report results.
What I mean is that every so often they'd report even if they didn't need
more keyspace yet, iff they had any new stats to report.
The nice thing here is that the work of the master and of the slaves is
almost the same.  The slaves don't have to do the initial assignment of
slave, and the master doesn't have to report results, but everything else
is the same.  With careful design you could use the same daemon for both
with a command line argument to tell it if it was the master (-m) or the
slave (-s).  Of course I'm sure you see that this allows you to add as
many levels as you want to the hierarchy.  A slave doesn't care whether
a slave or a brute talks to it.  The only thing that changes with the levels is the max size of an allocated chunk.
For each daemon it would be nice to have the minimum, maximum and default
chunk size configurable.  The master might have all three the same, since
it would be expected to talk only to slaves.  That doesn't mean you couldn't
get more than, (for example), 16th of the keyspace to work on.  It just
means that you'd have to make more than one request.
You could make the slave software available as well, and a site with many
machines could have only the slave contact the master to get assigned a
slave to talk to, and could configure all of their brutes to talk to
their own slave.
Software like this is easy to write, (and fun), and we should go for it:)
Of course I do everything like this in C++, but I suppose perl would be the
most portable.  It's a shame it's so aethestically displeasing to the eye.
perl's never a pleasant read.

Wouldn't this result in the slaves higher in the list being hammered?
Perhaps you want to do something simular to what the later releases of bind do with machines with multiple names, and round robin the list.
If you had a list with hosts A, B, and C, the first request would get
ABC, the next BCA, the next CAB, and the next back to ABC.  That would
distrubute the work between the slaves a bit better.
Actually this is what I meant, that they would ask for it.  My idea would
be that when a slave is asked for keyspace, if they don't have enough
they'd ask for the next large chunk.  That way the central server doesn't
ever have to deal with small requests.
You might consider it:)
Quite right.  I'd assume that the first level list of slaves would be controlled
by you.  If you're careful enough a slave should be able to go down and come
back up without losing any state at all.  All brutes/slaves talking to it
should be able to continue on with no loss of information.  I would put an exponential backoff on the time between retries for the brutes talking
to the slaves as well as the slaves talking to the master.  (With a limit
for the amount of backoff of course.)  If you can't talk to someone you
might sleep for 8 seconds and retry, if you still couldn't back off to 16,
the 32, then 64, then 128, etc...the maximum might be somewhere around ten
or fifteen minutes, so that within ten or fifteen minutes of crashing and
being restarted everything would be humming along with no manual intervention
required on any of the lower levels.
That's a good point.  If you want to keep track of who has what, it all has
to get back to the root eventually.  If you use my idea of having the
slaves cache the information until the next time they'd be contacting the
root anyway, (or whenever the timer elapses,) then you greatly cut down
on the number of small packets seen by the root, (and each level of slaves
when their's a hierarchy).
  Sound like we could have a religious war if we wanted, but this
isn't the right list for it:)  (sigh;) Maybe we should move this portion of
the discussion to alt.my.favorite.language.rules.and.yours.of.course.sucks.
I'm not really a snob about it...I still think cobol's great for some purposes, I just prefer coding in C++.

David Conrad wrote, quite well:
I think that this is a quite good idea with one caveat.  That we use a good random algorithm.  As people on this list are quite aware, many
algorithms that ship in libraries of commercial OSs are flawed in one
way or another.
Perhaps a combination of the two: give the whole list rotated in a
round-robin fashion, and let the client do with it as they will.  There
are enough coders on this list that we'll soon see independently developed versions of the client software, (although a published protocol for talking with the slaves would be nice), and some might
like to draw the first from the list, another randomly choose one,

You might use the key to find out a name, and bank account number, or

pop 2 does bump up the current number with an ACKS, but if you move around

I just reread the rfcs to make sure that I wasn't missing anything,

I agree, it's a good job of publicizing these holes, but (not to take

What if all NFS traffic was encrypted via a shared key distributed via

I'd love to see something in there about most commercial sites being behind
firewalls without nfs access across the firewall.  This greatly reduces the
risk from the nfs problems.  If you get your binary via nfs from a trusted
host inaccessible from the internet, then if you have this problem management
can handle it as an employee problem;)  There are ways to make secure
firewalls, it's fairly well understood.  Sometimes people point to things
like the hack Mitnick did last Christmas, but his attack took advantage of
a couple of things a security expert shouldn't have allowed, first and
foremost two machines were accesible from the internet, and one of them
trusted root logins from the other without a password:(
I could write something up about it if you'd like.

Nah, it's not as bad as all that.  There's fixes to all of this, they're well
known, and actually in place at some places.  Because it's such a pain having
good security on all of the machines most sites choose to have really good
security on a firewall to keep the bad guys out, and through policy, isolation,
and less stringent security measures protect the machines inside the firewall.
That's not to say that everyone with a firewall has good security, far from it.
It's also not to say that everyone without a firewall is vulnerable, they're
not...I know folks with all of their machines buttoned up tight.  It's possible
to close most categories of holes, and to detect intrusions in progress.  You
say you're worried about the system being corrupted so that you can't trust
calls to the OS.  Some attacks do work this way, but you can prevent the attack
via a combination of good security and good practices.  And yes, secure authentication and transmission of data makes everything much simpler;)  Without
it you have to essentially pull up the drawbridge and trust no one outside the
moat, since there's no way of knowing if anyone, or any host is who or what they
say they are.  If anyone wants more specific information about how to protect
from various attacks I can help or give you references to the literature, but
I won't go into it here since I expect that most anyone you'd find on cypher-
punks knows all this at least in outline already.

I feel moved to make a couple of comments.
o Dr. Fred did get over the edge.  His communication style had little to
  recommend it.
o He did make some good and useful comments along with some others.
o Some people posting anonymously and otherwise took out of context
  quotes in an apparently mean-spirited way and slammed the guy.
o Dr. Fred reacted
o Others reacted
o Some people took private email from Dr. Fred and quite unethically replied
  publicly on this list without his permission.
o I see both sides as owing this list apologies.
o There are two sides to this whole thing.
Fred brought up some concerns about possible holes in software just as many
of us have.  Most the time things like this result in good discussions on
this list and concensus is reached about the holes existing or not and
the extent of the holes.  Because of Dr. Fred's presentation, he quickly
alienated people, and what little discussion there was about his theories
was lost in the noise.
We'd do better to let it drop.  In the future if someone really annoys you
in the way they present something, perhaps it would help more if you sent
them private email noting that their communication skills are working against them and giving them some helpful pointers about how they could have
done things differently.  That way you'll be part of the solution instead
of part of the problem.  It's easier to get your dander up and express your annoyance publicly, but that affects all the rest of us.

Good suggestions all, but don't forget "Network Security Private Communication
in a PUBLIC World" by Kaufman, Perlman and Speciner.  This book covers a lot
of great stuff.  It doesn't use complicated math when not required, and explains
the math very clearly when it's needed.  It explains DES and IDEA well enough
in plain language that you can understand how to implement them.  While I love
Bruce's book, it's much harder to understand than NSPC.  I highly recommend
this book to everyone.  I don't think any crypto library would be complete without it.  It's in contention for the official bible of crypto along with
Bruce's book.

eight 4bit hex digits, or 32 bits, except the top nibble only has two bits

Nah, I suggested they reformat into 80 columns and suggested a different title

Someone else on this list mentioned that an edge detection algorithm would help here.  You wouldn't have to try to detect letters if there were no edges.
It could give you a quick go/no go.
They mean that if you don't feel secure with theirs, you could use yours in

sort of like a license plate.  Think of it as this:
      C   SUMO      CLU     NE
      See Sumo      Clue    No (clever putting a foreign word there, eh?
                                But not clever enough to throw us off! )
and realizing that sumo refers to sumo wrestling:
      See wrestling clue    no
and when you realize that a clue tells you about the reality of something:
      See wrestling reality no
or rearranging:
      See wresting no reality
      See, wrestling has no reality!
And you can see that it's a simple assertion that professional wrestling's
not real.  It's wrong of course.  Think about when they pick someone up
and throw them.  If that happened to me it would hurt...don't you think?

@_subject: MD5 concerns, was Re: Netscape Logic Bomb detailed by IETF 
This is the second time you've implied that an MD5 checksum might not be
as secure as we think.  Could you share your thinking on this?  I had
believed from reading the algorithm that it's not possible to predict how
a change in the input will affect the checksum.  Given a modified version
of netscape for example, how would you change some non-critical portion of
the code to get the same checksum that the original should have.  I suppose
that give n bits of non-critical space in the code, (non-critical meaning
that changing them will have no effect on the execution of the code, and
assuming that you don't want to change the length of the code), that you
could try all possible combinations of those bits, or 2^n trials and
see if you get the correct MD5 checksum.  If you do, then on average you'd
actually only have to try 2^(n-1) trials. What if you don't?  What would
you do then?  MD5 produces a 128 bit output, and it would seem likely that
this would be hard.  As far as I know there are no known attacks for any
MDx algorithms in spite of Ron's worries about MD4.  It's a subject of
on-going research though, and it is only "conjectured that it is
computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same
message digest, or to produce any messages having a given prespecified
target message digest." (RFC 1321)  So, if you have newer information,
or pointers to any papers, (other than the ben Boer and Bosselaers papers),
could you let me know?

"Network Security - PRIVATE Communication in a PUBLIC World", 1995, Prentice
Hall PTR, ISBN 0-13-061466-1, by Charlie Kaufman, Radia Perlman, and Mike
This book is amazing.  It explains hard concepts in ways that make them
seem obvious.  I can't state this too emphatically.  The style of the
book is conversational, approachable and a fun read, while at the same
time maintaining technical exactness to the point that you can implement
algorithms from the discussions in this book, (and understand how they
17.6.2 Coping with Export Controls is very interesting, detailing the weird
hoops that Lotus jumped through to retain as much security as possible while
still meeting export requirements.  The authors make the point that what
happens to you when you go through this process is almost random depending
on the times as well as the individual person you deal with.
The ANS.1 section is blunt about the space problems, and indeed much of the
book is refreshingly blunt about the stupidities involved in a lot of this
The quick proof of why the initial and final permutations add nothing to the security of DES is presented in an informal and quite obvious sidebar.
The comment is made that by the same argument the permutation of the key
in the generating of per-round keys also adds nothing to security.
It also includes homework and would be a wonderful textbook.
Here's an abbreviated version of the TOC.  Note that the real index is much
richer than this.  I've given the complete version of section 3.3 to
illustrate.  All typos are mine.  I think we can no longer refer to Bruce's
book as the Bible, but must refer to the two books as the Scriptures;)

Subcommittee on Technology and the Law in response to their follow-
up questions to the May 3, 1994 hearings.
                   ---------------------------
          Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the Law
 Hearing on the Administration's Key Escrow Encryption Standard
        Written Questions for Vice Admiral McConnell, NSA
*Questions for Senator Pressler:
Q:   Admiral, as you are aware, critics of the Administration's
proposal argue that as a practical matter, no criminal, foreign
spy, or terrorist of any sophisticated would be foolish enough to
use an encryption device designed by the NSA and approved by the
How do you respond? Why do[n't you] think the people whose
telecommunications the NSA and the FBI want most to decode will be
the very people most unlikely to use this technology?
Answer:   From what we know today, the overriding requirement that
spies, terrorist, and criminals have is for readily available and
easy to use equipment that interoperates.  Key escrow encryption is
not meant to be a tool to catch criminals.  It will make excellent
encryption available to legitimate businesses and private citizens
without allowing criminals to use the telecommunications system to
plan and commit crimes with impunity.  We believe it would be
irresponsible for government to make excellent encryption broadly
available knowing that its use by criminals would make it
impossible for law enforcement agencies to conduct lawful wiretaps
against them.
The Department of Justice credits information gleaned through
wiretaps as leading to more than 20,000 felony convictions since
the early 1980s.  This would not have been possible if the
criminals had been using encryption systems the FBI could not
Without government action, however, this fortunate situation
will change.  At present most people, and most criminals, don't use
encryption.  However, there is an increasing public awareness of
the value of encryption for protecting private personal and
business communications.  Increasing demand for encryption by the
public will likely lead to the widespread use of some form of
standardized encryption on the public telecommunications This development would have great benefits for the country.
Legitimate businesses an private individuals could use the
telecommunications system secure in the knowledge that their
private information such as business records and credit card
numbers could not be intercepted by third parties.
But there is a down side.  Criminals, terrorists, and others
could also use the system to plan crimes, launder money, and the
like, completely secure in the knowledge that law enforcement
agencies could not listen to those communications.  Just as
legitimate businesses operate much more efficiently and effectively
using the telecommunications system than they could without it, so
will criminal enterprises be able to operate more efficiently and
effectively if they no longer have to avoid using the
telecommunications system.
The United States is faced with a choice.  We can sit back and
watch as the emerging national information infrastructure becomes
a valuable tool for criminals and terrorists to use to plan and
carry out their activities with complete security, or we can take
steps to maintain the current ability of government to conduct
lawful wiretaps so that prudent criminals will have to find other
less efficient ways to operate and foolish ones may be caught.  Key
escrow encryption is the later option.
Q:   Would widespread use of the Skipjack algorithm harm U.S.
exports?  Do you think it is unlikely foreign businesses will
purchase American encryption technology if the U.S. Government
holds a set of the decoding keys?
Answer:  I do not believe that widespread use of key escrow
encryption in the United States will harm U.S. exports.  If it has
any effect at all, it could increase exports somewhat.  Key escrow
encryption products provide another option for foreign purchasers
that they have not had in the past; to the extent that foreigners
doe purchase key escrow encryption products, it will mean an
increase in exports.  Meanwhile, U.S. exporters are free to
continue to sell the products they currently sell in foreign
markets and to seek license approvals for new products.
It is difficult to predict the foreign market for U.S. key
escrow encryption technology.  Businesses that fear U.S. Government
interception of their communications presumably would avoid
products for which the U.S. Government hold keys.  However, there
are a number of reasons why foreign businesses might purchase them.
One major reason would be to communicate securely with U.S.
businesses that use them.  In addition, the superior level of
security provided by key escrow products (against all but lawful
U.S. Government access) may make them attractive to foreign
business that do not view U.S Government access as a major concern.
While some prospective users abroad may steer clear of key escrow
products because the United States will retain access, there may be
many who believe they are unlikely to be targeted by U.S.
intelligence in any case or for whom the superior security offered
by key escrow encryption products against threats of greater
concern may make key escrow products an attractive option.  For
example, a distributor of pay-TV programming may depend on
encryption to ensure that only those viewers who pay for the
service can decrypt the TV signal.  Such a distributor probably
would not be concerned about the threat of access by the United
States Government, and might favor suitable key escrow encryption
products over competing products that use weaker encryption
Q:   You were present when the previous panelist, Stephen Walker,
described how present U.S. laws prohibit his company from exporting
encryption products.  As I understand it, Senator Murray's bill
S.1846, attempts to relax these export controls somewhat.
Please give us your views on this legislation.
Answer:  I support the Administration's position, as announced
by the White House on February 4, that current export controls must
remain in place and that regulatory changes should be implemented
to speed exports and reduce the licensing burden on exporters.  The
bill you reference appears to be inconsistent with the
Administration position.  I would be happy to provide you further
information on the Administration's reasons for maintaining the
current export controls in an appropriate setting.
*Questions from Senator Murray:
Q:    In my office in the Hart building this February, I downloaded
from the Internet an Austrian program that uses DES encryption.
This was on a laptop computer, using a modem over a phone line.
The Software Publishers' Association says there are at least 120
DES or comparable programs world wide.  However, U.S. export
control laws prohibit American exporters from selling comparable
DES programs abroad.
With at least 20 million people hooked up to the
Internet, how do U.S. export controls actually prevent criminals,
terrorists, or whoever from obtaining DES encryption software?
Answer:  Serious users of encryption do not entrust their
security to software distributed via networks o bulletin boards.
There is simply too much risk that viruses, Trojan Horses,
programming errors, and other security flaws may exist in such
software which could not be detected by the user.  Serious users of
encryption, those who depend on encryption to protect valuable data
and cannot afford to take such chances, instead turn to other
sources in which they can have greater confidence.  Such serious
users include not only entitles which may threaten U.S. national
security interests, but also businesses and other major consumers
of encryption products.  Encryption software distribution via
Internet, bulletin board, or modem does not undermine the
effectiveness of encryption export controls.   [Primary written questions for Admiral McConnell]
1.   The Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1994 has
authorized $800,000 to be spent by the National Research Council of
the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of federal
encryption policy.  Can we wait to implement the key escrow
encryption program until we have the benefit of the NRC's study?
Do you think this study is necessary?  Should this study be
Answer:  We do not believe that we can wait until after the
NRC study is completed in 1996 to begin implementation of the key
escrow initiative.  The information technology industry is dynamic
and fast-moving, and to wait another two years or more would, we
believe, jeopardize the success of the initiative.  Industry demand
for encryption products is growing, and the technology is available
now to meet that demand with encryption products that provide an
outstanding level of security to the user conduct lawful wiretaps.
To wait for the completion of the NRC study to other encryption
products which would defeat lawful wiretaps.  We believe that such
a delay would not be in the best interest of the American Neither do we believe that the study should be expedited.  For
our part, we will carefully consider the conclusions of the NRC
study.  We expect that it will give very careful consideration to
the issues, and we would not want the pressure of an unnecessarily
short deadline to limit the study group's ability to produce the
best report possible.
2.   The Administration has said that it is continuing to restrict
export of the most sophisticated encryption devices, in part,
"because of the concerns of our allies who fear that strong
encryption technology would inhibit their law enforcement
capabilities."  Do we really need to help our allies by prohibiting
the export of strong American encryption products, since those same
countries can simply control the encryption bought within their
Answer:  Exports of encryption products are subject to review
primarily to protect U.S. national interests, including national
security, law enforcement, foreign policy, and other important
interests.  The law enforcement concerns of our allies are a
consideration, especially as the ability of our allies to combat
terrorism, drug trafficking, and other international law
enforcement problems can have direct benefits to the United States.
However, foreign law enforcement concerns do not drive our export
control policy.  We would continue to review encryption exports to
protect U.S. national interests even if foreign law enforcement
concerns disappeared.
3.   Do you know whether foreign governments would be interested in
importing key escrow encryption products to which they hold the
decoding keys?
Answer:  Several foreign governments have expressed interest
in key escrow encryption technology due to their own law
enforcement concerns.  There have been some preliminary
discussions, but issues such as who would hold the escrowed keys
and the circumstances of government access to escrowed keys must be
fully vetted.
4.   The Government wants the key escrow encryption standard to
become the de facto industry standard in the United States.  Would
the Government abandon the Clipper Chip program if it is shown to
be unsuccessful beyond government use?
Answer:  We do not expect the program to be unsuccessful
beyond government.  We have developed a sound security product that
we expect will find many uses in government information systems and
further believe that government use will bring with it a commercial
market, particularly in the defense sector.  We have developed a
sound security product that we expect will find many uses in
government information systems regardless of its success in
commercial markets.
5.   Openly available devices, such as Intel-compatible
microprocessors, have seen dramatic gains, but only because
everyone was free to try to build a better version.  Given the
restrictions on who can build devices with the classified skipjack
algorithm, how will key escrow chips keep up with advances in
semiconductor speed, power, capacity and integration?
Answer:  Despite the requirements that a firm must meet to
produce key escrow encryption chips, we expect that there will be
a number of manufacturers competing against each other to produce
the best product, and that such competition will drive them to keep
up with the latest technological advances.  It is worth noting that
only a few companies can produce the sophisticated microprocessors
you reference, yet the competition in that market has driven them
to achieve remarkable advances in that technology.  NSA's STU-III
secure telephone program provides an example of a cryptographic
product line that keeps pace with technology.
The presence of a classified algorithm does not preclude
keeping pace with technology.  Through NSA's use of a competitive,
multi-vendor approach, STU-III secure telephone products have
continued to evolve in response to user requirements and
technological advances despite their use of a classified encryption
algorithm and the consequent need for security restrictions on the
6.   How well does the Skipjack algorithm work on telecommunications
operating at very high speeds.  Is NSA working on another algorithm,
called BATON, that could be used in high speeds with a key escrow
system?  Will Capstone be compatible with BATON?
Answer:  Using currently available microelectronics technology
the SKIPJACK algorithm could not be used for encryption at very
high speeds.  BATON is the name of an algorithm developed by NSA
that could be used at higher rates of speed.  We have no plans to
develop key escrow encryption devices using BATON, however.
Instead, we are considering another algorithm for use at high
speeds with a key escrow system.
A high-speed key escrow device based on an algorithm other
than SKIPJACK would not be "compatible with Capstone" in the sense
that traffic encrypted by such a device could not be decrypted by
Capstone, and vice versa.  However, since such a device would be
used for much higher-speed applications than those for which
Capstone was designed, there would be no need for it to be
compatible with Capstone in that sense.
7.   Can Capstone be used to encrypt video programming?  If so,
have cable companies been approached by any government agency to
use Capstone to scramble or encrypt cable program?
Answer:  Capstone could be used to encrypt any digital signal,
including video programming, operating at up to about 10 million
bits per second.  It could be used for encrypting individual video
channels but not for bulk encryption of many channels multiplexed
together in a single link.  NSA is not aware of any government
agency approaching cable companies to urge the use of Capstone.
Two manufacturers have asked us about the suitability of key escrow
devices for this purpose, however.
8.   Encryption software is available that can be used with Clipper
to encrypt a message before after it has been encrypted with
Clipper.  This "double encrypting" risks bypassing the key escrow
feature.  If a sender first encrypts the message with software
using DES, and then transmits the message "double encrypted" with
Clipper, can tell you from looking at the cipher, or encrypted
text, that the underlying message was encrypted?
Answer:  The only way to tell that a message has been "double
encrypted" in this way would be to decrypt the "outer layer" of
encryption, i.e. that done with Clipper.  Only then would one be
able to tell that the message had first been encrypted with
something else.

There's nothing inherently wrong with using popen or system.  The problem
arises when you use information given to you from outside as the argument
to popen or system without checking it.  You should have an awareness that
whatever you pass to system or popen is essentially being passed as the
commandstring to a:
    execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", commandstring, (char *)0);
Make sure you know the implications of this.  If you know that what you're
passing can happily be exec'd directly, it's more efficient to do an exec yourself instead of (effectively) having a sh exec'd to exec your code.
Of course you can see that you shouldn't do something like:
    cout << "Enter the directory to list: "     cin >> buffer;
    system(buffer);
especially if you're running with any sort of priviledges.  Suppose someone
    / ; echo >>/etc/passwd "gotcha::0:0:Intruder Man:/:/sbin/sh
Obviously if this program was being run as root you'd be in trouble.
If it was running as a user it would let them do something like add
an .rhosts for the user that would let them get on the machine.  Once
on a machine it's often fairly easy to leverage that access into root
Oh well, I could talk about security all day:)

Wouldn't even know that if you permuted it.  You _could_ use a fixed

to select the permutation.  Even something as simple as taking 5 bits
from one source and using another source mod(random seed length) to
decide where to xor it into the random seed.  (Rotating back to the front if needed, or you could let the bits fall off the end.) And if
all you ever give out to randomness partners is the result of a good
hash there's no way they could ever determine anything from it, or
determine what effect their contribution had.  Shoot, they wouldn't
know if their contribution went into the seed, or merely affected
how someone elses contribution went into the seed.

It's worth mentioning that 8lgm (Eight little green men;) has recently
changed their policy on how long they wait to make exploit scripts available.
It has resonance with what's happened here on cypherpunks lately.  They
used to publish that there was a hole, but would hold up quite a while
on making the exploit scripts available.  They were trying to make it
safer for manufacturers and give them time to make fixes available first.
What actually happened is that manufacturers would put the fixes on the
backburner, and often not get around to them at all.  8lgm found that
publishing the exploit scripts usually resulted in quick fixes from the
vendors.  Now the exploitation details are available quite quickly.

                  A CLASS OF WEAK KEYS IN THE RC4 STREAM CIPHER
                                PRELIMINARY DRAFT
                                   ANDREW ROOS
                          VIRONIX SOFTWARE LABORATORIES
1.  INTRODUCTION
This paper discusses a class of weak keys in RSA's RC4 stream cipher. It shows
that for at least 1 out of every 256 possible keys the initial byte of the
pseudo-random stream generated by RC4 is strongly correlated with only a few
bytes of the key, which effecitively reduces the work required to exhaustively
search RC4 key spaces.
2.  STATE TABLE INITIALIZATION IN RC4
Although the RC4 algorithm has not been published by RSA Data Security, source
code to implement the algorithm was anonymously posted to the Cypherpunks   mailing list several months ago. The success of the Cypherpunks' brute-force
attack on SSL with a 40-bit key indicates that the source code published did
accurately implement RC4.
RC4 uses a variable length key from 1 to 256 bytes to initialize a 256-byte
state table which is used for the subsequent generation of pseudo-random bytes.
The state table is first initialized to the sequence {0,1,2,...,255}.   1    index1 = 0;
2    index2 = 0;
4    for(counter = 0; counter < 256; counter++)
5    {
6        index2 = (key_data_ptr[index1] + state[counter] + index2) % 256;   7        swap_byte(&state[counter], &state[index2]);
8        index1 = (index1 + 1) % key_data_len;
9    }
Note that the only line which directly affects the state table is line 7, when
two bytes in the table are exchanged. The first byte is indexed by "counter",
which is incremented for each iteration of the loop. The second byte is
indexed by "index2" which is a function of the key. Hence each element of the
state table will be swapped at least once (although possibly with itself),
when it is indexed by "counter". It may also be swapped zero, one or more   times when it is indexed by "index2". If we assume for the moment that
"index2" is a uniformly distributed pseudo-random number, then the probability
that a particular single element of the state table will be indexed by
"index2" at some time during the initialization routine is:
     P = 1 - (255/256) ^ 255
       = 0.631
(The exponent is 255 because we can disregard the case when "index2" and
"counter" both index the same element, since this will not affect its value.)
Conversely, there is a 37% probability that a particular element will _not_ be
indexed by "index2" during initialization, so its final value in the state
table will only be affected by a single swap, when it is indexed by "counter".
Since key bytes are used sequentially (starting again at the beginning when the
key is exhausted), this implies:
A.   Given a key length of K bytes, and E < K, there is a 37% probability that
     element E of the state table depends only on elements 0..E (inclusive) of
     the key.
(This is approximate since "index2" is unlikely to be uniformly   In order to make use of this, we need to determine the most likely values for
elements of the state table. Since each element is swapped at least once (when
it is indexed by "counter"), it is necessary to take into account the likely
effect of this swap. Swapping is a nasty non-linear process which is hard to
analyze. However, when dealing with the first few elements of the state table,
there is a high probability that the byte with which the element is swapped
has not itself been involved in any previous exchanges, and therefore retains
its initial value {0,1,2,...,255}. Similarly, when dealing with the first few
elements of the state table, there is also a significant probability that none
of the state elements added to index2 in line 6 of the algorithm has been   swapped either.
This means that the most likely value of an element in the state table can be
estimated by assuming that state[x] == x in the algorithm above. In this case,
the algorithm becomes:
1    index1 = 0;
2    index2 = 0;
4    for(counter = 0; counter < 256; counter++)
5    {
6        index2 = (key_data_ptr[index1] + counter + index2) % 256;   7        state[counter] = index2;
8        index1 = (index1 + 1) % key_data_len;
9    }
Which can be reduced to:
B.   The most likely value for element E of the state table is:
     S[E] = X(E) + E(E+1)/2
     where X(E) is the sum of bytes 0..E (inclusive) of the key.
(when calculating the sum of key elements, the key is considered to "wrap   around" on itself).
Given this analysis, we can calculate the probability for each element of the
state table that it's value is the "most likely value" of B above. The easiest
way to do this is to evaluate the state tables produced from a number of
pseudo-randomly generated RC4 keys. The following table shows the results for
the first 47 elements from a trial of 100 000 eighty-bit RC4 keys:
          Probability (%)
0-7       37.0  36.8  36.2  35.8  34.9  34.0  33.0  32.2
8-15      30.9  29.8  28.5  27.5  26.0  24.5  22.9  21.6
16-23     20.3  18.9  17.3  16.1  14.7  13.5  12.4  11.2
24-31     10.1   9.0   8.2   7.4   6.4   5.7   5.1   4.4
32-39      3.9   3.5   3.0   2.6   2.3   2.0   1.7   1.4
40-47      1.3   1.2   1.0   0.9   0.8   0.7   0.6   0.6
The table confirms that there is a significant correlation between the first
few values in the state table and the "likely value" predicted by B.
3.  WEAK KEYS
The RC4 state table is used to generate a pseudo-random stream which is XORed
with the plaintext to give the ciphertext. The algorithm used to generate the
stream is as follows:
     x and y are initialized to 0.
     To generate each byte:
1    x = (x + 1) % 256;
2    y = (state[x] + y) % 256;
3    swap_byte(&state[x], &state[y]);   4    xorIndex = (state[x] + state[y]) % 256;   5    GeneratedByte = state[xorIndex];
One way to exploit our analysis of the state table is to find circumstances
under which one or more generated bytes are strongly correlated with a small
subset of the key bytes.
Consider what happens when generating the first byte if state[1] == 1.
1    x = (0 + 1) % 256;                  /* x == 1 */
2    y = (state[1] + 0) % 256;           /* y == 1 */
3    swap_byte(&state[1], &state[1]);    /* no effect */
4    xorIndex = (state[1] + state[1]);   /* xorIndex = 2 */
5    GeneratedByte = state[2]
And we know that state[2] is has a high probability of being
     S[2] = K[0] + K[1] + K[2] + 2 (2+1) / 2
     S[1] = K[0] + K[1] + 1 (1+1) / 2
So to make it probable that S[1] == 1, we have:
     K[0] + K[1] == 0 (mod 256)
In which case the most likely value for S[2] is:
     S[2] = K[2] + 3
This allows us to identify a class of weak keys:
C.   Given an RC4 key K[0]..K[N] with K[0] + K[1] == 0 (mod 256), there is a
     significant probability that the first byte generated by RC4 will be        K[2] + 3 (mod 256).
Note that there are two special cases, caused by "unexpected" swapping during
key generation. When K[0]==1, the "expected" output byte is k[2] + 2, and when
k[0]==2, the expected value is k[2] + 1.
There are a number of similar classes of "weak keys" which only affect a few
keys out of every 65536. However the particular symmetry in this class means
that it affects one key in 256, making it the most interesting instance.
Once again I took the easy way out and used simulation to determine the
approximate probability that result C holds for any given key. Probabilities
ranged between 12% and 16% depending on the values of K[0] and K[1], with a
mean of about 13.8%. All these figures are significantly greater than the   0.39% which would be expected from an uncorrelated generator. The key length
used was again 80 bits. This works the other way around as well: given the
first byte B[0] generated by a weak key, the probability that K[2]==B[0]-3
(mod 256) is 13.8%.
4.  EXPLOITING WEAK KEYS IN RC4
Having found a class of weak keys, we need a practical way to attack RC4 based
cryptosystems using them. The most obvious way would be to search potential
weak keys first during an exhaustive attack. However since only one in every
256 keys is weak, the effective reduction in search space is not particularly
The usefulness of weak keys does increase if the opponent is satisfied with
recovering only a percentage of the keys subjected to analysis. Given a known
generator output which includes the first generated byte, one could assume
that the key was weak and search only the weak keys which would generate the
known initial byte. Since 1 in 256 keys is weak, and there is a 13.8% chance
that the assumed value of K[2] will be correct, there is only a 0.054% chance
of finding the key this way. However, you have reduced the search space by 16
bits due to the assumed relationship between K[0] and K[1] and the assumed
value of K[2], so the work factor per key recovered is reduced by a factor of
35, which is equivalent reducing the effective key length by 5.1 bits.
However in particular circumstances, the known relationships between weak keys
may provide a much more significant reduction in workload. The remainder of
this section describes an attack which, although requiring very specific
conditions, illustrates the potential threat.
As a stream cipher, a particular RC4 key can only be used once. When multiple
communications sessions are required, some mechanism must be provided for   generating a new session key each time. Let us suppose that an implementation
chose the simple method of incrementing the previous session key to get the
new session key, and that the session key was treated as a "little endian"
(least significant byte first) integer for this purpose.
We now have the interesting situation that the session keys will "cycle
through" weak keys in a pattern which repeats every 2^16 keys:
00 00 00 ...    Weak
(510 non-weak keys)
FF 01 00 ...    Weak
(254 non-weak keys)
FE 02 00 ...    Weak
(254 non-weak keys)
FD 03 00 ...    Weak
01 FF 00 ...    Weak
(254 non-weak keys)
00 00 01 ...    Weak
(510 non-weak keys)
FF 01 01 ...    Weak
(Least significant byte on the left)
Now while an isolated weak key cannot be identified simply from a known
generator output, this cycle of weak keys at known intervals can be identified
using statistical techniques since each of the weak keys has a higher than
expected probability of generating the _same_ initial byte. This means that an
opponent who knew the initial generated bytes of about 2^16 session keys could
identify the weak keys, and would also be able to locate the 510-key gap
between successive cycles of weak keys (although not precisely). Since the
510-key gap occurs immediately following a key which begins with 00 00, the
opponent not only knows that the keys are weak, but also knows the first two
bytes of each key. The third byte of each key can be guessed from the first
output byte generated by the key, with a 13.8% chance of a correct guess.   Assuming that the "510-key gap" is narrowed down to 1 of 8 weak keys, the   attacker can search a key space which is 24 bits less than the size of the
session keys, with a 13.8%/8 chance of success, effectively reducing the key
space by approximately 18 bits.
Although this particular attack depends on a very specific set of
circumstances, it is likely that other RC4 based cryptosystems in which there
are linear relationships between successive session keys could be vulnerable
to similar attacks.
5.  RECOMMENDATIONS
The attacks described in this algorithm result from inadequate "mixing" of key
bytes during the generation of the RC4 state table. The following measures
could be taken to strengthen cryptosystems based on the RC4 algorithm:
(a) After initializing the algorithm, generate and discard a number of       Since the algorithm used to generate bytes also introduces additional       non-linear dependencies into the state table, this would make analysis
    more difficult.
(b) In systems which require multiple session keys, ensure that session keys
    are not linearly related to each other.
(c) Avoid using the weak keys described.
6.  CONCLUSION
This preliminary analysis of RC4 shows that the algorithm is vulnerable to
analytic attacks based on statistical analysis of its state table. It is
likely that a more detailed analysis of the algorithm will reveal more
effective ways to exploit the weaknesses described.

Sure, I found the above offensive.  It comes across in exactly the same
tone as a cop saying, "Please step away from the car."  I know it's silly,
but sometimes Please just isn't enough.  The simple change:

@_subject: Looking for advice. 
For two programs communicating via TCP/IP and exchanging authentication
information, I want to make sure that the authentication info, (user's
name and password,) doesn't pass in the clear.  I can think of a few
ways to handle this.  1) Encrypt via shared key using symetric encryption.
   This works but key management is a problem.
2) Encrypt via public keys using public key encryption.
   There's licensing issues, and how do you generate public and private
   pairs for all of the programs?  That could be a lot of primes!
3) The "server" could keep user names and passwords stored as hashed values.
   That way the "client" could do a hash (MD5?) before sending it.
   This has the drawback of the server not having access to the unhashed
   values...if it needs that access this method won't work.
What are other possibilities?  What are the answers to my questions and
issues above?  Can you help?
