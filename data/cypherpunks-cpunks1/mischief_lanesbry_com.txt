You prefer "Students who don't repay their school loans need killing"?
Geiger held back because govt loans are statist bullshit. (And because he hasn't upgraded his HDD encryption to rijndael. Yet. Ninja, now's
your window....)
PS what's with "CDR:" without a space??? I'll have to retrain
my procmail. Some of the list admins - hint WHGiii - better
update their scripts.

procmail/mutt removed your junk, Jim. I thought you'd stopped
sending web pages to the list. You probably re-add the stupid
"CDR" to the subject every time you reply too...
1. "|urlview" is hard to mistype.
2. I didn't copy the URL
3. If you use google, you'll notice it keeps cached copies of result pages.
4. I only mentioned it because, I really don't care Jim. I am willing
to concede the absurd. 1000 metre waterfalls. Whatever. You win.

It's good to confirm you're as sloppy in reading email and geology
as you are in composing your usual half-baked COTUS rants.
It says waterfall. Nothing about the "1000 feet", the claim I
repeatedly questioned. To confirm this, use your self-proclaimed
search skills on the page for "1000" and "thousand".
Big claims require big proof. Not, "Yes, I'm sure" - your initial

So now it's not in the page. After all your bluster, you don't have
a cite. Maybe if you learn how to spell Gibraltar your searches will
be more fruitful.

@_subject: Cypherpunks IQ Test #0 to the Sirs 
Cypherpunks IQ Test Someone, purporting to be a woman, posts a series of questions
and rejoinders to cypherpunks. Do you:
a) beat your alpha-male chest for the attention of this beautiful
   young woman;
b) woo her/impress your friends with witty responses;
c) say "oh no, not again!";
d) Assume it is John Young turned Detweiler;
e) Try to work out who's behind it;
f) sotto voce "cypherpunks who answer silly tests need shooting"
g) all of the above, at various times.

classifieds ads in cypherpunks should be pgp signed so they're
non repudiable.

A similar study of email to cypherpunks shows that
up to 28% of all emails are trolls.

the cypherpunks.venona.com archive started doing this some time ago.
Ryan asked for suggestions on which threads to highlight. There was
a lack of enthusiastic participants.

@_subject: Google and the Net 
You cut out some lines:
someone wrote about Altavista's cache of USENET back in '93.
Cypherpunkly issues of your past coming back to haunt you,
and blurring of private/professional identity followed.
As to how long google can be an archiver of the whole net...
altavista went about 6 years before its owner started looking
to sell it. And that didn't carry binary content. Now that's
owned by google as well.
