First, I'd like to tell you to REALLY read this and REALLY give it some thought before you say, "it doesn't work". It works. But you have to follow it and do everything just like it says. Read through this a couple of times to fully understand how it works.  Once you get the hang of it, it's easy.  If you need extra cash it's worth READ ON.......................
 THIS REALLY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY
A little while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just like you are
now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make
thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of
$6.00! So I thought," Yeah, right, this must be a scam", but like most
of us, but I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send
$1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then
place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at  and
post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No
catch, that was it. The main difference between this system and others
is that you have a mailing list of 6 instead of 5... This means that
your average gain will be app. 15 times higher!!!
So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought
about trying it. I figured what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and
$6.00, right?
Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the
legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!
Then I invested the measly $6.00.............plus postage
Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail!
I was shocked! I still figured it would end soon, and didn't give it
another thought. But the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I
made about $20.00 to $30.00 dollars. By the end of the second week I had
made a total of over $1,000.00!!!!!! In the third week I had over
$10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have
made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly.......
It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I spent more than that on the
Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it
works....also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you
can get the information off of it as you need it. The process is very
simple and consists of 3 easy steps:
STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST" (include your name and address). Now get 6 US$1.00
bills (or equivalent in your local currency) and place ONE inside EACH
of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the
envelope to prevent thievery. Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6
sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase,
your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating
a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!
Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses

STEP 2: Now take the  name off the list that you see above, move the
other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as
number 6 on the list.
STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as
close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at
least 200 newsgroups. (I think there is close to 24,000 groups) All you
need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make!
Don't know HOW to post in the newsgroups? Well do exactly the following:
THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post
away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for
each newsgroup!
**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**
That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within
day's! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount
of mail you receive. **MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**
Now the WHY part:
Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example).
So then I made $5.00 with my name at  on the letter. Now, each of the
5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each
with my name at  and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5,
that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM
posts with my name at  and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an
additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the
MINIMUM 200 with my name at  and only receive 5 replies each, I will
make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those
625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at  and they each
only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125
persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at
 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive
$15,625,00! With a original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! And as I
said 5 responses is actually VERY LOW! Average is probable 20 to 30! So
lets put those figures at just 15 responses per person. Here is what you
will make:
at  $15.00
at  $225.00
at  $3,375.00
at  $50,625.00
at  $759,375.00
at  $11,390,625.00
When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest
posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the
list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The
thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all over
the world are joining the Internet and reading these articles everyday,
JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really
works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out
and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that
happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people
who are joining the Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to
give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000
to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the
actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will work.
You just have to be honest.
Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW, also. Try to keep a list
of everyone that sends you money and always keep an eye on the
newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS
THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic idea to make the
GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from
this, which is tons of extra CASH
