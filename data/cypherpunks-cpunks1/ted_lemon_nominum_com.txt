Oh please, this is absurd.   How hard is it to violate my privacy?   How much good does DRM do here?   If you can't plug the analog hole for something as data-intensive as a DVD, how do you plug the analog hole for something as trivial as a social security number?
I have to assume that what you're saying is that I will somehow use DRM to secure information that I give to a company with whom I want to do business.
    But this is unlikely ever to happen in any meaningful way - in order for this to work, the company with whom I am doing business has to have some incentive to implement DRM.   The incentive can't be that I refuse to do business with them if they don't, because most people *do not* refuse to do business with companies that violate their privacy.   Indeed, in many cases,
  we have no choice - if you want water, you sign up with the water department.   If you want power, you sign up with the power company.   There's no market there - these are monopolies.   There's no opportunity for market leverage to impose DRM on them, even if the average person cared enough to make that happen, which they don't.
I know this will come as a terrible blow to those who are morally against government coercion, and prefer the subtle coercion of the market, but if you want privacy, there's gotta be a law.   And at that point, DRM for your personal information becomes something that I suspect is too expensive to be worth it.   Do you keep all your money in a safe, or is some of it in a bank, or in a wallet, or in your dresser drawer?   Why don't you keep all of it in a safe?
