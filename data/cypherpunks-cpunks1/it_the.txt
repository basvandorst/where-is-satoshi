Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 30-Jan-96 Re: [NOISY] Your own
Zundel.. by Rich Graves at networking.s This is an enormously important point to make. Rich put the files online
via AFS, which is where I got them, supplemented by some taken directly
from the Z-site. We did *not* do it request of the Zundelfolken.
I've updated the censorship.html file at my mirror to reflect the
nuances of the situation.
BTW, Sameer has mirrored, and someone in Japan likely will too.
