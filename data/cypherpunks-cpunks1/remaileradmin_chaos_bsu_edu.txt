Earlier, somebody indicated that large primes of the form 2^(2^n)+1
exist... actually, it is conjectured that beginning with F5, all are
This person is probably confusing Fermat numbers with Mersenne numbers
(see my earlier post) - large Mersenne primes exist, but not all
Mersenne numbers are primes.
Also, it was suggested that 2^128+1 is prime; this is false.  You can
almost do the calculation by hand using Fermat's Little Theorem.  But
with Mathematica:
PowerMod[3, 2^128, 2^128+1] = 47511664169441434718291075092691853899
This is not 1 so 2^128+1 is definitely not prime.
Well, many Carmichael numbers do have small factors, but not
necessarily.  If you derive the formuals for creating Carmichael
numbers, you can use them to create Carmichael numbers with prime
factors, arbitrarily large if your patience is willing.
For example (with just a few minutes of Mathematica time)
p = 600035641
q = 1200071281
r = 1800106921
n = 1296230964879005767193383441
p,q,r are prime
n is a Carmichael number
And incidentally, Carmichael numbers can have more than three prime
factors, for instance 7 * 13 * 19 * 37, the smallest Carmichael number
with four.
Well, for our purposes, we only care if the probability is lower or
higher than (1/2)^k.  Maybe you can be more certain than (1/2)^k in
which case you are even happier.  So this is "fallacious" because the
probabilities aren't independent... so, what, are we talking larger
than (1/2)^k or smaller?  If smaller, then (1/2)^k is an easy to
calculate upper bound.
Earlier, I said:
Okay, this paper you keep referencing - does it apply to primality
testing based on pseudoprimes (converse of Fermat's Little Theorem),
or other methods, such as Miller-Rabin?  The above passage (the double
quoted one) applies specifically to Miller-Rabin, a test which has no
"bad" inputs - e.g. there exist numbers which will always pass
pseudoprime testing, but there do not exist numbers which always pass
Miller-Rabin.  For M-R, the chance of failure depends on the number of

L. Tood Masco:
This is a wonderful, wonderful idea.  The biggest blow to privacy
in this decade was when Lotus Markeplace was withdrawn off the market.
This ifnromation is already widely distributed.  The only effect
the withdrawal had was keeping the public in the dark about what infromation is out there in the world about them, and (by inference)
how it was obtained.
The sad fact is, most of the political action over 'privacy' only
has the net effect of keeping people in the dark about what information
they are giving out to complete strangers about themselves. Most people don't realize, at either gut level or
fully at the intellectual level, just how much personal information
they are giving away when they write down their Social Security
or other universal ID number on a form.   As long as the information
is only being swapped between skyscrapers, so that most peple aren't allowed
to access it, this ignorance will contininue.  People will realize
what they are doing when it's sitting in front of their faces on the computer screeen.
I also highly recommend using anonymous remailers to post allegedly
personal, but in fact widely available, information to the net
such as credit card numbers, credit histories, medical data, and the like -- as long as viable alternatives for the victims are
available.  Timing is critical here; let's be ready to do this
but not jump the gun until the alternatives are available.
Let's promote real privacy, technology that gives customers real knowledge and choices about what data they give out, rather than the current bankrupt political movement which promotes
information theft from ignorant consumers, and the hoarding and monopolisation of information, in the name of 'privacy'.

Press Release
August 17, 1994
The Samaritans are a non-religious charity offering emotional support to the suicidal and despairing. A test of "Help By E-mail" launched on July 14, 1994 proved so successful that an Internet domain is now open and is reached by mailing jo at samaritans.org.
The E-mail service is run from Cheltenham, England, and is reached from anywhere with Internet access. launch,  Mike Haines, the Director said:
"During the test month we received over 200 messages. Many were from well wishers, journalists and academics but there were around 15 very desperate people as well. The need for a full launch of our service with an easier address was amply demonstrated." The Samaritans have been offering support to the suicidal and despairing for over 40 years by phone, visit and letter. Callers are guaranteed absolute confidentiality and retain the right to make their own decisions including the decision to end their life. Samaritans are carefully selected and prepared for this work (for which they are not paid). Those working with E-mail have additional training. Volunteers read and reply to mail every day of the year. A nominal end date of December 31, 1994 has been set but initial results have been so encouraging that it is likely to run indefinitely.
The idea of an Internet service was born when a volunteer was exploring the UK based CIX conferencing service. Here, he discovered the "suicidehelp" self help group and Newsnet groups such as "alt.support.depression". After discussions with The Samaritans General Office it was decided to try offering a service from Cheltenham. The kind donation of a modem by US Robotics was a great help as was the assistance of staff at Compulink Information Exchange The Samaritans of Cheltenham and District

Kudos to Hal Finney for his descriptions of Stefan Brand's offline
cash.  As with other offline cash protocols it contains the following
What happens when we've caught Irving double spending (or million
spending?)  Is it guaranteed that Irving will have enough in his
bank account to cover the fraud?  I don't see any way to guarantee
that except for absurdly large security deposits.  Also, are
bank accounts required to be in True Names so that multi spenders
can be caught and punished?  If so, how do we prevent  the use of
numbered accounts, Duncan Frissel's nom de guerre accounts, etc. and do we really want to set up that kind of True Name infrastructure?
Also, what about stolen coins?  If Irving can succeed in
stealing a coin from Jane without her knowledge, Irving
can spend it untraceably as many times as he can get away
with (perhaps thousands or even millions, depending on what
security precautions we layer above the offline cash), and
Jane gets fingered.  On the other hand, Jane might simply
give Irving some coins, plausibly claim they were stolen, and split the proceeds from Irving's spending spree.
In general, multi spending might occur because of accident,
malice, or a combination of those two factors.  How do we
distinguish between accident and malice to determine liability,
reputation loss and/or punishment?

I thank Hal Finney for his thoughtful reply, and Tim May for
his excellent essay.   It looks like we can start to draw a stronger conclusion: there are serious holes in the assumptions made by offline digital cash protocols when applied to computer networks rather than manually operated smart cards.
Hal's comparison of coin theft to digital signature protection and repudiation is apt, but usually Irving only has one or a few keys to protect, while he might have thousands of coins, issued by
various banks.  I doubt digital signatures will ever be
used alone much for signing expensive contracts.  A
digital signature on an expensive contract, in addition
to being repudiable, will be suspicious, since if few people
accept such signatures as strongly binding (the initial
state), they will not be widely used on expensive contracts, and thus their existance on an expensive contract will be suspicous.  I predict it will become common practice, or even law, that digitally signed contracts over a certain amount are automatically invalid unless further precuations have been taken (signatures of notary witnesses, or perhaps some better crypto protocol designed for this purpose).
The trouble with offline cash in a network environment is that
the upper limit for fraud liability can be incredibly high.
If there are hundreds of thousands of vendors on the net, a situation CommerceNet predicts before the end of the decade, and they are using this offline protocol, then even with small transactions the fraud could run into the millions of dollars.  There's plenty of incentive for Irving to steal Jane's coins, run off to some place on the net that has no extradition treaty, and pump good change out of the vendors and into his Lichtenstein account to his heart's content.  We may yet find protocols to mitigate or limit this kind of fraud -- make change traceable if linked to double spending, do random
online checks as a cypherpunks poster suggested last year, or
similar precautions layered on top of the basic protocol.
But so far these problems haven't been put on the front burner
of digital cash design, and already we have people out there selling
offline cash on the network as a superior solution!
Reliance on law enforcement flies in the face of
cypherpunk goals, and indeed against the goals of good cops as well -- one of their most vocal complaints is about
people setting up systems that are vulnerable to crime, putting
them in unecessary danger.
It also goes against political reality to think that a startup
operation can lobby governments all across the globe to protect
a system that is ideal for money laundering and tax evasion.  Ain't gonna happen -- they'll let those "dirty money banks and money laundering net sites" rot; they may even give Irving a helping hand.
I disagree that "there is no excuse" for double spending.  If
the software is implemented badly (no fault of the user),
it might get mixed up with systems programs in such a way as
to cause double spending.  For example, if the system crashes
and one must recover from a month old backup, one has to
go through that old purse and determine which coins have been
spent.  If the software and/or user makes a mistake in this process, we get double spending.  If a network burps and
sends a vendor two coins where there should have been one,
we get double spending.  The possibilities for accident are legion and cannot all be foreseen.  "Shit happens".  A protocol that treats common
accident the same as criminal fraud, when the stakes are
so high, is pathological.
In the online system the consequences of double spending
(or million spending) are far more benign.  At worst
one customer is out stolen coins.  In a networked offline
system those same few coins are a potential loss for
every vendor on the net.  As Tim May noted, we may not even need to recongize fraud in online
cash -- just treat all online double spending as accident.   No bonding, secured accounts, investigators, ID badges
or cops with guns busting down Janes's door after
Iriving has million-spent her coins.  Here we both have a simple liability system and much less chance of fraud.
Tim May also suggested that most offline protocols are
intended for manually used smart cards.  This makes sense --
unlike an network environment with automated spending agents,
the scope of multi spending for manually used pruchases
in small amounts is quite limited.  On the network even
fraud of a few cents per transaction can quickly add
up to big $$$ across thousands of vendors.
What are the communications costs of online clearing, anyway?
Don't credit card clearings cost about two cents per transaction
these days?  If clearing costs are less than plausible offline cash
fraud and fraud prevention costs, online cash is a winner,
both now and increasingly in the future as bandwidth becomes even cheaper.

Greetings. We are enjoying rebuffing your latest volley in the newsgroups. You have really gotten desperate, it is clear! Our last exploding shrapnel bomb into the newsgroups (Operation South Pole), was a fantastic success; you have been scurrying madly with the damage control. And szabo at netcom.com really is almost dead, contrary to whatever *you* think. Unfortunately one of our key outlets has taken a serious hit, but we overtaxed the site anyway and expected to lose it eventually.
This message is a little notice that our Wham, Bam, Thank You Ma'am
campaign starts today. When it is finished, you will see a variation of
our signature below. We think you will enjoy the `bounces' and some
more of the polymorphic paragraphs. Remember the Golden Rule, do
unto others as you would have them do unto you! -- and what goes around,
comes around! he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword! what's good
for the goose is good for the gander! for every action, there is an
equal and opposite reaction!
It may be next weekend perhaps in two weeks that we mount operation SQUISH. Obviously, a key strike has to be planned carefully and
accompanied with feints to be successful and effective. We appreciate all the great ideas you have provided us lately, and the highly
entertaining squirming and contortions. Remember, if the guerilla is not losing, he is winning!
Take care :-)

Well, I run three remailers, and as far as I know, the system
administrators don't know about them.  Actually, for the two on
rosebud.ee.uh.edu, I don't think the admin would care since it doesn't
take up much cpu time.  The remailers run on previous accounts I had
when I was a student at UH.
As far as Rice, the usage policy states:
:Sending electronic mail directly to an unofficial automatic mail
:handling program is not allowed.  Unofficial means something that is
:not a standard part of the system and has not been installed by the
:Owlnet system management.  Using an automated method to direct any
:incoming mail to an unofficial program is not allowed.
so the chances of me running one here are zero, since I can't really
risk the hassle with my only account.  Well, running it from a school account is probably the least expensive
option :-)  If you have your own machine then that's the way to go!

Copyright 1994, Nutthin Puke.  All jellies preserved.  Intelectual arguments
DA-- Determined Atheists
Before I start, it may be informative to consider that I consider myself to
be a hard-line member of the Atheist Preservative movement, and a hard-
line advocate of religious freedom.  I am a PhD candidate in tantric sexual
practices at the University of California at Sodom, and I got the 'Separation
of Church and State' language added to the 1774 Republican Party of Texas
platform.  I am a member of Atheists against Christians, and am two hundred
and twenty-seven years old.
As the American community continues to grow, the differences of conviction
that exists generally in the world find their way into the community.  Some
demand that newcomers to the USA adapt to the atheist mores of this society.
Some demand that the USA, as a newcomer to the world, adapt to the religious
beliefs of the outside.  As recent events have demonstrated, the less
reasonable, on both sides, may be endangering the integrity and availablity
of the USA.  Calls for USA-wide religious censorship, it may be expected,
will continue to grow unless the USA can find some way to police itself.  Yet
"police itself" is a term that sends the USA into fits.  My solution, DA, is
for the appropriate users to directly censor the publications that they might
legitmately lay claim to censoring--publications that flows to minors over
which they have legal authority and responsibility.
Specifically, this is a plan to create two sorts of reader in the USA--
adult and minor.  Adult readership may only be obtained by persons of age
eighteen.  Minor readership may only be obtained in the presence of adult
readers, refered to as supervisor librarians.  Adult readers would have
full access to anything in the USA.  Gospel tracts, prayer meetings, Turner
TV, and like press being viewed by a minor, would cause a Clipper call to an
adult supervisor to allow access.  Newspaper editors, in particular, would
censor any letters submitted from a confused Christian juvenile reader.
The legal framework that I see important in aiding such a system is as
State Level:
1)  Declare to hold harmless those Church bookshops for charges of Contributing
to the Delinquacy of a Minor that obtain and verify the age of bible readers,
and maintain a DA system of access for minors.  Certain acceptable
verification methods specified, with authority to add methods delegated
to a regulatory agency.  Emphasis to be on ease and speed of verification.
Special consideration for in-church bookshops.
2)  Make it illegal to misrepresent age and name data to a religious bookshop.
Require library operators to maintain a record of age and name of religious
book readers for thirty days after borrowing a Bible or putting a request
for a religious publication on hold.
3)  Declare aiding in tampering with DA system to be "Contributing to the
Moral Degeneracy of a Minor" and "Promoting religion in direct contravention
of Californicate Provision 69".
Federal Level:
Pass paralell laws for Churches operating with dioces in two or more states,
or for Churches operating with 800 'dial-a-prayer' numbers.
I believe that such a system would protect the full free expression of religion
currently enjoyed in the USA, while reaffirming parental responsibility in the upbringing of their children.  The burden of controlling access devolves
all the way to the parents, making perversion charges against Church elders
patently frivolous.  Advocation-of-religion charges would then be MUCH more
difficult to press, since a jury could be told that specific steps were being
taken to prevent access to minors.  If parents complained that they didn't
want to go to the trouble of spelling out what their children could access,
the response is clear:  "Oh, so it's not worth the effort to you?"
Despite slurs in this group to the contrary, I believe that the proposed
god.* heirarchy may well be the first in a series of attempts to censor
atheism in the USA.  Remember, we already have had a censor for porn,
religion, and unwholesome Hostess-brand snacks.  It is not really a question
of _if_ but _who_ and at _what level_ will this censoring take place.

funny think about garcia, his first time ever post on c'punx was about
larry too......  strange times indeed when a newbie bursts on the scene
knowing all about us
I'm not familiar with anonymous remailer internals.  Would it be cheap
in terms of hack-time to add the capability for an anonymous remailer
to maintain a list of addresses (or address regexp's) which do not
wish to receive anonymous remailed messages?
That way, if Detweiler is sending unwanted msgs to say,
"chess-fans at foo.bar.com" via an anonymous remailer, and the readers of
chess-fans complained to the (hopefully responsive) remailer operator,
the remailer operator could add the "chess-fans" address to a "don't-
remail-to-these-folks" list so that the nice readers of chess-fans can
read mail in peace.
However, if the "Don't-mail-to-these-folks" list gets too long, it
would probably degrade remailer performance... sigh.  (remailer authors:
is this a correct assumption?)
(Perhaps the "don't-mail" addresses could be tagged with amount of time
somebody last attempted them;  addresses that no one's attempted to
hit in say, a year, could be expired.)

NeoSoft is a commercial access provider, not my employer.  (They didn't
demand identity verification when I signed up, either.  Yay, capitalism!)
P.S. Larry:  I didn't make the "tentacle" list in your SQUISH post?  I
feel slighted!  Please correct in the next version.

I mailed this about 5 minutes before the news of list death arrived, so
it didn't make it. Conspiracy! Anyway, I posted this to comp.org.eff.talk
and so far it has generated no interest.
The Cypherpunks have been mentioned in various articles in the mass media
as a group that would at least toy with the idea of civil disobedience
concerning ITAR violation. Imagine yourselves trying to topple ITAR
by publically exporting PGP to many countries, every day, for over a
year. Yet do any of us really want to push our luck this way? Phil
Zimmermann is out a lot of cash paying for a legal team. He can hardly
afford taking his family out for dinner.
That's why discovering this, I feel it should make *news*. As it turns
out, the internet's largest Macintosh ftp archive has been exporting
MacPGP2.2 every day for the last year! This to Singapore and China and
God knows where else. Every country on Earth with an internet connection,
Here is a satirical essay, explaining what anyone who takes ITAR at
face value might do if they discovered this situation....

This info on internet anonymous remailers is maintained by
Matthew Ghio Last Updated: Mar 14 1994
The newest version of this document can be obtained by sending mail
Automated software will email you a copy.
Notice: There have been many changes lately to various remailers.
I try to keep this info as up to date as possible, but I may have missed
something.  If there are any errors, please let me know.
The standard cypherpunks anonymous remailers are:
hfinney at shell.portal.com
catalyst at netcom.com
nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu
remailer at chaos.bsu.edu
hh at soda.berkeley.edu
ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu
remailer at merde.dis.org
remailer at rebma.mn.org
rperkins at nyx.cs.du.edu
rperkins at nyx10.cs.du.edu
hal at alumni.caltech.edu
All of these allow you to send anonymous mail by adding the header Request-Remailing-To: and sending to one of the above addresses.
Most (but not all) of these remailers also accept Anon-To: in place of If you can not add the required headers, place two colons (::) on the very
first line of your message, then on the next line type Request-Remailing-To:
and the address you want to send anonymously to.  Skip a line, and then
begin your message.  Note that by using this method it is possible to send
a message consecutively thru more than one remailer.
remail at extropia.wimsey.com requires that you public-key encrypt your
messages with PGP.  This added security prevents a hacker or nosey
sysadmin at your site from reading your outgoing mail or finding out where
it's going.  This remailer is not directly connected to the internet,
so messages will be delayed about an hour.
Some of the other remailers support PGP as well.
For remailers which support both encryption and plaintext messages, identify
encrypted messages by adding a header which reads:  Encrypted: PGP
Encryption keys can be found below.
The bsu remailers require that you place the Subject: header in the body
of the message, after the two colons and the Request-Remailing-To:
line.  These remailers also allow you to insert a Reply-To: line right after
the Subject, so that you can have responses sent to you via an anonymous
forwarding address.  The other remailers require that you place two number
signs ( on a line, and then add the special headers, such as Reply-To:
To get an anonymous forwarding address, send mail to mg5n+getid at andrew.cmu.edu
There is a pseudonym-based anonymous remailer at anon.penet.fi.  For
information on this remailer, send mail to: help at anon.penet.fi
There is another anonymous contact service at chop.ucsd.edu.  It's not as
full-featured as anon.penet.fi, but is considerably faster since it is not
burdened by such a heavy load.  For information on this remailer,
send mail to: acs-info at chop.ucsd.edu
Anonymous postings to usenet can be made by sending anonymous mail to one of
the following mail-to-usenet gateways:
group-name at cs.utexas.edu
group.name.usenet at decwrl.dec.com
group.name at news.demon.co.uk
group.name at news.cs.indiana.edu
The following lists the response times of the remailers listed above.
Although measured accurately, these times are only an estimation of what
you can expect.  Actual response times will vary somewhat, depending
on current network usage and other factors.

The operation of this system of remailers is a group effort which relies on
the contributions of many generous people.  Please do not abuse the remailers.
If you have problems with a remailer, most of the remailer operators can be
contacted by sending mail to the remailer's address without a remailing
request header.  Otherwise, follow the instructions that come in the messages
from the remailer.  Do not send complaints to postmaster site.
Most of the remailers are run by people who are not the site administrators.
Sending to postmaster or the site admins will most likely just make them
annoyed at you, and won't get your problem resolved.
If you can run an anonymous remailer, please volunteer to do so.
Software is availiable from anonymous-FTP at
soda.berkeley.edu in the directory /pub/cypherpunks/remailer
Other remailer program code is availiable at vangogh.vis.colostate.edu
in the directory /pub/nate/remailer-GUI/cpremailer.tar.Z
The software can usually be run on personal accounts;
Root or sysadmin access is not required in most cases.
There are two usenet forums for discussion of anonymous remailer systems,
alt.privacy.anon-server and alt.anonymous
