@_subject: Backup of Encrypted Partition 
Apologies if this is too much of a beginner's Q.
Does anyone know how to backup a "SecureDrive" partition onto tape quickly and easily.
HPACK is really slow.
PKZIP and then PGP is slow.
RAWDISK, seems to be quite complex (perhaps I am just stupid!), and I am terrified of making some sort of terrible mistake.
I have about 100MB in the partition.  I have a pretty out of date computer which is a 386 33MHz running Windows.
Any ideas and all the best.
