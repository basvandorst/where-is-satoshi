In addition, (if I remember correctly from _The Puzzle Palace_), a person who was heavily initially involved in the formation of NSA also helped establishing the Chinese Intelligence Service.  Also from the same book, in the US has set up, with Chinese approval, a sigint shop within China.  This was done to sigint the Russians.  With the tensions between the US and China now, I'm not sure whether they closed shop or not.

The S-Boxes in DES were optimized to hinder Differential Cryptanalysis.  I've seen no studies on the effectiveness of jumbling the S-Boxes during encryption -- even Biham and Shamir's book doesn't mention it -- but, I figure, if it helps, DES would probably already be doing it (unless of course the NSA thought the jumbling would make too good an algorithm).

Any statistical correlation can be used to an attacker's advantage.  Maybe your kid sister might not be able to figure it out, but someone else out there will.

I've actually been thinking about using chaos to sporadically add noise to some information before the info is encrypted.  After decryption, the receiver would then have to separate the noise from the real content.
Has anyone else thought about this?  Please respond directly to nyap at garban.com 'cos I'm no longer on the cypherpunks list.

Knowledge about TCP/IP is alot easier to control than knowledge about the Berlin Wall (ie, how many Chinese will even know of the existence of TCP/IP -- in the US, where this is freely available, how many citizens know of it's existence)?
