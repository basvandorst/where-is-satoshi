We got an official legal opinion, which was that wholly-owned subsidiaries
of US entities are subject to US regulations in this area.
Are you really sure that they bought it all? That would go against what
we had been told, and I have a great deal of respect for the legal/crypto
expertise of "Barry an Jay" at the Washington, DC, law office of Hale & Dorr.
