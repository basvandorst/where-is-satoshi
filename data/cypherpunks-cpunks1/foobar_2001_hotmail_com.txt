@_subject: Recommendations for Cypherpunks Books 
I would like to read worthwhile books in the cypherpunk genre! I have a few Can you distinguish a "cypherpunk" genre from a "cyberpunk" genre, and is it a worthwhile distinction, and what are the features ?
What are the worthwhile books to read to learn about cryptography in the future, and the culture of people "into" cryptography ("cryptoheads"!) ?

Perhaps I can offer a starting point:
First tier (works that are specifically focused on cryptographic (1) - books on future worlds and spaces: in particular, those that explore social, moral, political, technical, ethical issues (to be science fiction), or those that merely explore worlds (to be fantasy)
(2) - books on cryptography theory and systems: from the basic theory (cryptography primitives), to the high level systems (public key (3) - books on privacy, ethics and social questions: defining good and bad cryptography in the various contexts (low level technical, high level social), including politics (trade barriers).
Second tier (works that are more general and not specifically focused on cryptographic technologies):
- second tier to (1) - general science fiction and fantasy exploration of future worlds involving technology or otherwise, but not primarily focused on cryptography (technical, social or ethnographical)
- second tier to (2) - general mathematics, communications and computing, such as number theory, quantum computing, dna computing, internetworking systems, identity management.
- second tier to (3) - general computing and technology issues of privacy, ethics, sociology, ethology.
What I would enjoy reading:
- books on cryptoterrorism and cryptoliberation, where a major part of the plot revolves around the use of cryptography technologies in terrorism or - books on cryptocommunities, where a major part of the plot revolves around people that are "cryptoheads" and for which cryptography and technology is a major part of their lifestyle (people who somewhat live, breathe and eat Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at

@_subject: Cryptographic Tourism 
I am to visit Russia soon: Moscow and St Petersburg, as a tourist. My interest is to visit interest telecommunications, cryptographic, espionage and related places. I have already visited GCHQ, MI5/MI6, NSA, DSD/ASIO on my trips to the United States, Australia and Great Britain. Can readers offer suggestions for a high-tech junky.

@_subject: Some other math/crypto sci-fi  
I enjoy a scene from a recent Bond film - where James is called on the telephone whilst he is in a compromising position with an academic at Cambridge University. He suavely navigates the telephone call, and when finished, his female companion remarks "James, you were always a such cunning linguist". My memory of the scene may differ slightly, but hopefully you pick up the play on words. The academic was a languages specialist, and if course, she was gorgeous.

Alan Olsen:
wouldn't that be perfect? a "collectable patent card game", as a way to
criticise patents (by using the most ridiculous ones on the cards),
which in itself violates a patent... hm, I like the idea...
"combine the 'patent for display of blablah' with the 'method or device
for remote information acquisition' and you can cross-license that
against your enemie's 'global computer network patent' for 10 points."
This would be a fabulous way of introducing young children into the new emerging world.
One of the strategies of the game would be to build a patent portfolio. For example, you have developed an idea, and now you need to take out something like 250,000 patents on anything and everything possible and even likely to be tenously linked to protecting your idea, anything near your idea, and how to produce your idea, or sell your idea, or do anything likely to be possible with your idea. Your opponent pays the role of a patent lawyer, trying to navigate through every little crack in your patent portfolio armour. It would be a wonderful way of illustrating how one simple creative idea requires ten times as much creative ideas just to protect that original idea. An excellent introduction to the simplicity of the contemporary world.
