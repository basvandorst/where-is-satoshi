i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
doesn't she look like lucy from chronicles of narnia? and the fact that she's 31 makes me happy to be 31.
when she does these weekends she fills up really fast so don't wait- if you need color and/or cut and/or face waxing at very reasonable prices email her promptly and she'll get you booked and give you directions. we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. 4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
i love the comments i get from all of you. mostly i just stinking LOVE knitting. she's cute
cate was so happy she began yelling "let's give a hand to springtime! last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!
but then again, we looove roadtrips.
in a tiny town in idaho
simple is always prettiest to me. interested? i think it would be so fun. i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
i am not going to worry...about a thing.
i mean, look at her hair. i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
