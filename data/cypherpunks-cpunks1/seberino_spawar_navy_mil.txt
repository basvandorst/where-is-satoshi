@_subject: [p2p-hackers] MixMinion vs. onion routing & GNUnet question 
Performance is a secondary goal to the first 2 in GNUnet.  The first
2 are related so I'm not sure how or why they need to be treated
I don't know how GNUnet's architecture compares to mix networks.
I *do* know that GNUnet attempts to protect against traffic analysis.
If you think mix networks are better, they better have good
protection against traffic analysis.  Can you point us to any
good URLs or papers on how mix networks protect against traffic
