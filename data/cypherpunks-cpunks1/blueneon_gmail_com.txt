This could also be a big show stopper for cellular and radio networks. Many
use a 10.0000000 MHz timebase distributed from a GPS disciplined local
oscillator for precise time and frequency synchronization. Without this
tight frequency stabilization from a GPS receiver, major drama will occur
on the "borders" between simulcasting repeater coverage areas, cell sites,
etc. Can anyone say Spaghetti mess? Owwwww my brain hurts.
