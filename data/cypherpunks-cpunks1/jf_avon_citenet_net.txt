@_subject: What backs up digital money? 
I do not think so.  The common never holds value because value, especially
in a crude civilisation, is related to rarity or difficulty to produce and obtain.  AFAIK, gold was considered a value in every civilisation.  If some
did not consider it a value, then, they either ignored it's existence or had
so much that it was not a value.  Marbles are easy to make in most civilisations.  They therefore cannot be used as a value standard.
One problem with e-$, as pointed out by many, is that it has to have a *perceivable* value.  Backing it by something physical that is already valued
might be the best way to launch it.  Otherwise, it will have the statute, if
legally, at least in the mind of the average Joe, the same as junks bonds.

I played with Magic Money recently.  I wondered:
Where are the passwords of the various PGP keys stored?
Now, suppose you want to use this system for serious use:
What, if any, are the critical files that must be protected
from outsiders to prevent tempering (altering without the owner's ability to
quickly discover the manipulation) with the system data?
Is is necessary to encrypt the whole client directory when you
don't use it?
Ditto, for the server?

Dear Declan.  This post is not personnally against you Declan.  I
like your posts.  Only, I don't agree with you last post.  And permit me to advance this: it is through an honnest error of yours that you have this opinion.
So, here it is:
I don't agree with you.  The world is being stangulated and
bloodsucked dry by peoples who are nothing but cheap shots.  It is
not a matter of being polite or not, it is a matter of saying things
as they really are.  It is a matter of acknowledging reality.  It is
a matter of integrity.
The best way to blow up their cheap littles looting schemes is to simply *say* the truth.  We live in an age where everybody is terrified of stating what everybody damn well know but tries as hard as they can to blank out.
By giving a simulacre (english word?), a make believe of moral sanction, you permit them to commit their crimes against human mind and life.  It is *us*, the producers, who grant them a recognition by being polite to them while they propose to eat us alive.  You wouldn't let a hiway robber to mug you without trying everything you can to prevent it, yet, you permit thoses statists leeches to confiscate an enormous part of your life, to rule an enormous part of your life, to define an enormous part of your life rules.
I grant much more respect to a bank robber than to a politician: the bank robber puts his own ass on the line, takes his own risks, and doesn't pretend he's doing it for you.  He is a robber but he makes no bones about it and he accepts the risks of the "trade".  Ask yourself if your friendly neighboorhood politician fits this My famnily owned a land.  The city expropriated us at around 1.85$/sq.ft. while they evaluated, "for taxation purposes", the land at 4.85$/sq.ft.  They sold the land to a local "silicon-valley-style" project who went bankrupt so the city could repossess it.  We fighted the provincial govt (and won partially) because they planned to have the capacity to re-sell the land for housing projects, therefore speculating on expropriated land.  Hey, I'd rather have the 10$ it is worth that let them have them.  We damn worked this land for 50 years.
And all of this was done in the name of "for the good of science",
technology and high-tech employement, all with the full moral
sanction of our universities most famous universities, provincial, federal and municipal govt.  Only, there is not a damn business that came to establish itself there.  Finally, one big pharmaceutical did but there is probably a lot of corruption underneath.  It stinks.
The way they could perform that extortion was with the aid of hundreds of half baked semi truths and fallacies, all in the name of some "unknown but all desserving" fucking "public".  If we would have simply stood up and named their fallacies in the first place, they would have had a much harder time doing what they did to us.  but our modern lawyers and "counsellors" said that we should "play along".  Since the land had 9 co-owners, FUD worked well and most owners were
convinced to play the game, therefore granting them the moral
sanction of acknowledging realism and legitimacy.  It was *all* done
in the name of "tolerance" and of being "open minded".  But as I
said, a little poison is still poison.  In retrospect, by granting
them the semblance of reason, *WE* forged reality for them, *WE* gave
them a moral sanction.  I am not one of the owner.  My mom's family
is.  I watched the scene with rage but I couldn't do anything. Try
to make theses peoples understand after being told for all their
life that "being polite" and "being tolerant" is a must...
There is no such thing as being tolerant to being killed.  You don't just "die only a little".  In the same way, you don't loose "only a little" taxed dollars or free speech.
I am not a Randian, but I agree with many ideas of Ayn Rand.  I don't recite half-memorized paragraph out of her books, I fought and still fight as I can the govt in their looting schemes.  I was there, sitting with ministers and arguing with them.  I saw the leeches in action.  So, if you persist at advocating politeness in thoses situations,
next time a mugger try to beat you, try to remain polite in the first time... Many friends of many politicians will get rich on it.  Our layers
will get rich on it.  We worked the damn place for 50 years and
*owned* it.  Land, not that far from there was sold at around 16$. Land behind ours was sold 7$.  We got 1.85$.
If anybody wants to argue with me, first send a check for the
difference between 10$ and 1.85$, times the sq.ft. surface of the
land. (e-mail me by PGP to have the figures :)  Then, we could
*start* discussing the virtues of statism.

I got some reply that told me that, basically, the inherent anarchy of CPunks would make it impossible to hold a vote.  Some even questionned
the utility of a logo.  Some other said that many peoples use non-graphical
While I think that a logo is a nice idea,  I never even considered designing one myself before somebody mentionned the idea, today on CPunks.
IMO, I think that a logo would appeal to non-techies.  The typical non-
techie attitude is to *ignore* anything he/she does not understand.  The proposed label "PGP signed" or similar would not have the effect a good
logo would on certain persons.
A logo could make PGP look "cool".  I am not prejudiced against trying to
attract peoples who would not look up by themselves, especially considering the actual condition of the net.
Refuting the usefullness of a logo would be an expression of the opinion that dumbness is uncurable.
MHO on it is that while dumbness will always exist, *specific individuals* could be educated.  This is especially true of the youngs. And beside, the masses never made anything change for the better... In this optic, and regarding the fact of the immense popularity of software that requires little computer knowledge, I think that a logo is not only appropriate but also necessary, if encryption issues are to be resolved in our favor.
Many techies, and many members of CPunks are of this type, scorn at the
"uneducated" public.  It is a great mistake they do.  Not because they
have have a duty to the public, but because in the "public", lives intelligent individual that, for a multitude of reasons, did not follow the same path as them.  They owe it to themselves, our of selfishness

While I do not believe nor endorse the neo-nazi movements and their ideas, I consider interesting to be able to look at their arguments, if only to make my own opinion of them.
I understand that you banned a WWW site providing such information.  I also understand that this site presented this information to oppose the german govt. in their censoring actions against some such sites.  I do not have a first hand knowledge of the content of the specific site (Zundel) that started the whole thing and I am convinced that many other pro-nazi might use some material presented in a decent way for quite questionnable ends.
But nevertheless, from what I read, you seemed to have banned a site out of political correctness.  I hope it is not true.
Unfortunately, freedom and liberty, thoses crutial and typically american values, seems to be eroded first by thoses trusted to protect them: the american intellectual and scholar.

If this restriction is circumvented by the kid, don't you think that the said kid will find ways to get whatever he/she wants no matter the laws?

     *THAT* is the thing I have most problems to.  This sentence is boobie-trapped.  Let's me state, for the book (or maybe hard drive),
that I do not subscribe to this view of Man.  I believe that selfishness is a virtue and that altruism is at best a psychological

Any producers does follow the demand very closely or he gets out of      But govt intervention, rules, standards, etc are *all* enforced at the point of a gun (even if deeply hidden under a pile of red tape).
This view implies that *because* you can produce, you have a duty to the

     I agree with you on this one: wouldn't it be wonderfull to have porno

     Actually, just as I mentionned, every entities that seeked to control
man used guilt to do so.  And by the nature of guilt, sex and human mind,
sex is *the* best thing to induce guilt.
     Since a large part of the population *are* controlled through the sex-guilt association, it is extremely handy to create the pseudo-justification the govt need
for their actions.
     But as I said previously, the biggest threath to the govt is that peoples
can now find each other and talk together.  Previously, we had the means to
talk but no means of finding each others.  The Internet provides this.
     Unless you discuss about how freedom of speech should go unbreached...
No, for all it matters, it is anonymity.  Because the swiss banks does
not publish the name of accounts holders.  The recent case of German police raiding homes of german citizens working in Lischtenstein(?)
banks shows that, far all that matters, theses banks accounts are anonymous, i.e. there is no way for the german govt to know the name
of the accounts holders.   Their only way to gain knowledge is through
the use or threath of physical violence.
     Sorry for my stupidity, but I *completely* fail to understand.
Would you please explain what are your basis for stating so?

I agree with that.  Principles are important.  I agree that Sarin reciepes might

But I think that this control should be effected by the individual poster, out of benevolence for Man, not enforced at the point of a gun by a govt that pretends that we are to dumb to act by ourselves.  The nature of the Internet is unique in the history of mankind.  We must adapt, *as individuals* not as "a society".
The collectivity is a statistical concept that have no existence, apart in the pretensions of the collectivists do-gooders.
I think it is safe to say, especially regarding coverage of the Internet by
popular medias, that even if there are some journalists that still have integrity,
most of their bosses don't.
Well,  here I don't completely agree.  *you* can determine what is worth and what is not.
But again, I suppose that if you have rationnal arguments, you will be able
to convince other rationnal individuals.  I am not in favor of broadcasting neo-nazi scum all over because I think that their essence is the same as the one
underlying the censorship movement.  They share the same vision of man, only the
flavor change slightly.  OTOH, somebody presenting facts pertaining to nazism and

One thing you have to assess, is: what is the percentage of the population who
longs for a 'free lunch'.  And also, how much money is a big company willing to subsidise the predictor of the 'suicide' of a new competitor (the case of the lone inventor with patents rights and a revolutionary invention).  If you underestimate this number, you (or other like-minded peoples) might very well end up on the exit end of a gun barrel...

@_subject: PGP backdoor? (No, I'm not paranoid.) 
Dear Perry,
many peoples hear many things.  The difficult part is to figure out what
is the validity of what ones hears.  I personnally heard a things or two,
even if I am not involved in any way in the trade of crypto.  I heard them
through outside channels, completely independently from any crypto-activist, wether pro or con (CPunks et al or Govt).  Theses sources are of utmost
qualifications.  Wether or not there is a "vast conspiracy" either to make
us believe that, for an example, PGP *is* or *is not* crackable we *do not*
know.  Every side have vested interests.   Many opinions that PGP is secure
rest on *actual* evaluation of our computing capabilities, actual or forecasted.  And experts are *very often* wrong.  Have a look at history of sciences... You'll realize that most accomplishments were held as
impossible even shortly before they were discovered/created.  Such is the
history of intra-abdominal surgery, of space flight and of many other
knowledge and/or technology.
In most instances of life, it is much wiser to realize that *we do not know*
and accepting ignorance as such rather than adopting the first tempting
rationalization that comes to mind.  Because in the former case, you still
have the possibility to enhance life by learning, while in the second, you
can only hope that you did not adopt a wrong belief that will eventually
cost you dearly.
Remember, when an ostrich puts it's head in the sand, which part of it's
anatomy it is showing to the world...
So, why waste bandwith with a post that apparently mainly seems to be aimed
at dismissing somebody but brings *absolutely no* new knowledge to the discussion?  Please, next time, post privately.  Funny jokes are, IMHO,  welcome because they have some life-enhancing value. So please, at least be funny...

IDEA is reputed to be resistant against known plaintext attacks.
But I did not read about wether or not it is resistant to several-plaintexts (?choosen plaintext) attack.
If the sectors were not salted, each zeroed sectors would translate in an identical way on the encrypted disk.  So, there would be only one cyphertext-plaintext pair repeated over many empty sectors.
If you salt the encryptor, there are many different cyphertexts corresponding to one single plaintext.
Can the salt be figured out by an attacker?
If yes, would the many-cyphertext to single-ultimate-plaintext could give an edge to an attacker?
In that case, it would be effectively better to not wipe a drive with The problem is, realdeal cannot be turned selectively for only one drive while not wiping the other one.

But by his nature, being a violent or thug at heart, he will understand this "peace based on threat" maybe even better than a pacifist at heart.  So, my arguments might not stand.

Well, yes and no.  What made me change my mind is when I tried to see the situation from the standpoint of a guy from a thuggish mentality. Actually, it might not deter somebody else acting on the spur of the moment.  Take a typical harsh divorce situation where peoples act in the most surprisingly irrationnal way.  I think that ex-husbands or wifes would get targeted more than their fair share, and quite often, without any reasonable cause.

I was having a discussion with a retired physics dept director the
other day.  He never heard of AP and we did not discuss it.  But we
discussed the Net a lot.  And he made a very fundamental remark.  He
said someting along thoses lines (not an exact quote but one that sums
it up in essence) :
"It is amazing how the Net is.  It is a total anarchy and yet, it
seems to work *perfectly* well without any central decision making
authority.  Actually, no central authority could ever make it happens
better than this actual anarchy led by self-interest on the part of
each individuals each owning a tiny piece of the network."
It make me think about how essential the govt is, and especially in
the field of economy...
Some peoples have a vested interest in maintaining the system as it
is.  For example, take here in Canada, progressive tax rates / a flat
income tax.  If a flat income tax rate would be put in place, just
think of how many chartered accountant would be jobless overnight...
Anybody who discuss it openly on the net and plan to implement it will
get killed by governments (pick your favorite one).  I find it very
unlikely that all e-mail on the topic is not monitored, just as
anything having my name, or Jim Bell's or anybody else that ever
discussed the topic.  Even peoples who apparently seemed to denigrate
AP, like Unicorn, will be suspected since they'll reason that he might
have a secret wish to implement it while opposing it publicly.  Just
like mole get to the highest rank in the organization they want to
undermine.  That is the *nature* of any security oriented
organization.  And communicating with each other with PGP without remailers would
probably put us instantly on a hit list.  To quote a famous french
comic strip " when in doubt, it's better to hang..." .  The best
protection is either a long chain of remailer or to post *everything*
publicly on C'Punks *AND* several newsgroups at the same time.  Then,
again, they might make "examples", helped by a scare publicity
campaign by the mass medias.  Wake up to it guys, if ever such a system gets implemented, it will be
a major war and govt will use every allies they might have (mainly,
the conventional mass-medias) to eradicate it.  The war will be fought
underground but it will be savage, as all wars are.
I don't think that you will ever succeed to "educate" a sufficient
part of the public to make things work as you figured.  The net
population represent a minuscule fraction of the population and most
net surfers don't even care.  C'Punks has a total cumulative
subscription of, say, 10000 (out of the blue number), which represent
(at 40E6 internet users) around 2.5 percent of 1 percent of all net
Many individuals consider that it is better to get taxed to 50% and
keep 100% of their life...

I guess I made myself misunderstood.  I meant to reply to Jim Bell mentionning that he would like to see some peoples interested in discussing the implementation of AP.  It is very different than just talking about (against) govt.
No. No offense meant, but you are wrong here. Did you read
Assasination Politics?  By the nature of it, govt employees will get
killed and *this* warrant trying to kill everybody they would
suspect of setting up an AP server.
No offense, but please, re-read the paragraph.  That is exactly what I meant...
Did you read the AP essay?  I don't think so otherwise you wouldn't have commented in that sense.  What you say is true but IMO, AP is absolutely different from The Economist.  Remember, it entails asassination of govt employees...
I did not say "subscription", but "cumulative subscription".  I think that C'Punks is having around 1500 subscribers theses days.

I thought of that for a long time.
 - Use a microphone on your sound card and locate it close to the computer
 - generate a (relatively short) set of random number, maybe using the PRNG of
      computer.
 - Use the LSB of the sampled sound, the sampling being done at intervals fixed
     the serie of numbers generated by the PRNG.
 - when the numbers generated by the prng are exausted, re-use part of the
output stream
     as a random source of numbers for the sampling interval.
 - keep doing this up until:
     1) you are fed up of looking at RND numbers on your screen
     2) you have no use for rnd numbers anymore
     3) your hard disk is full
     4) your computer cpu is so mixed up that it starts outputting all your PGP
        files in Serbo-Croatian cleartext
     5) any other reasons deemed reasonable by the computer operator

@_subject: Duress 
The transponder analogy might not be very accurate.
When you fly in a controled airspace, the *controller* asks you to dial in certain digits on the transponder.
If you do not dial them in, the controller will start harrassing you
for doing it and for not complying and for entering airspace
while unauthorized.
You have to do it.  depending on cockpit configuration, the hijacker
might very well have no choice but to let the pilot do it.
In any case, this is a situation where there are 3 persons involved
(hijacker, pilot and controller) vs 2 in the duress case
I would guess that most hijacks gets disclosed before they land because
there are so many ways that the pilot could stego a help message in the
flow of the numbers that are exchanged btwn him and the ground.

No, it does not.  Making art more palatable is simply the process of free trade between two uncoerced entities.  If the artist does not offer
what the corporate purchaser wants he will not sell.  He thus adapt his
style out to his customer.  Nobody is threatening to use force to
have the artist conform to the client.  Nobody is forcing the client to buy what he does not like.
The artist does not have to compromise, he simply have to refuse the Anybody using the term "censorship" to describe that is in the following
situation : he *wants* the advantages of the contract (money) without
respecting the customer, therefore.  He deplores the fact that somebody
(the customer) can act to his best judgment.  The fact that the artist
calls that censorship shows that he have the same thought process as
the true censorers, i.e. the conviction that the end justify the means,
and more specifically, the feeling that *his* ends justify *any* means.
The artist may not act on his feelings but nevertheless, they are, in
essence, of this nature.
And unfortunately, too many artists think that way.

Jim seems to analyse a situation in terms of broad principles, while Dave seems to focus more on specifics that would disprove Jim.
I agree with the Dave's last phrase in the sense that our models of reality
should indeed be rooted in reality.
But considering that in most european country, you are recognized guilty unless proven innocent, it is only non-contradictory to arrive at Jim's
conclusions.  The basic psycho-epistemology at work there is implying that.
Maybe that on the instant, ugly things are not happening, but nevertheless, the basic principles held about man, his nature and therefore, about how he should be treated leads, by their own logic, to ugly things.

@_subject: [hrdware] anti-Tempest video settings 
Hi again.
Is there anybody that have any idea about a color setting that would make it more difficult to detect by a Tempest attack?
(I assume that Tempest cannot discriminate between various color guns and signals in the monitor...  Maybe I am completely wrong...)
Like, for example : background: G255 B0   R0
      text: G0   B255 R0
Theses colors are not that bad to look at.  I realize that Tempest is sensitive to actual electrical values rather than logical values.
Anybody has any idea about settings that could fool Tempest?

I was writing a passphrase file to later be secsplitted and I suddenly got all sweaty and nervous ...  :-)

But of course.  But what I want to know is: is there some combination of display colors that will be visible for the eye, but not for the Tempest equipment?  That might answer it.  I suppose that if some "stealth" settings exists, they are highly hardware dependent.  My question was not "would it work in all instances?" but rather
"had this tactic been implemented successfully in *some* instances?"
Or, to the contrary, is it reasonable to assume that modern Tempest equipment can
work around theses impediments almost all of the time, therefore making any attempts at this futile?

Does Tempest detects only the emission from the electron gun in the monitor or can it get a usable "lock" on some other signals generated within a computer?
As an example, can it grab the keystrokes?  If the answer is yes, can it do it:
a) rarely
b) occasionally
c) most of the time
d) almost all of the time
e) never
Could somebody knowledgeable in Tempest can rate the various emissions from a computer?
(such as: keyboard, COM port, modem, lpt, video signal(from the card), disk write, monitor emission, network comms, etc)
Just curious...

Well, first of all, we should find how much of the population
*really* believe in what govt says.  There is a difference between
the politically correct opinion that Joe & Jane Public give to a
poll interviewer and what they really think.
Second, you suppose that Joe & Jane Public really like and approve what they understand from what the medias say.
And finally third, this system does not work according to the will
of a majority.  It wouldn't take too many peoples who believe that the
medias and their perceived lack of integrity is widely responsible
for the way the world goes right now, to have a substantial prize put
on the head of the medias.
Therefore, any journalist with two+ working neurons will realize
that sticking to the most objective facts available would be the best
way to build a great reputation while sticking to govt propaganda
would be a great way to attract a prize on his head. If peoples decided to put a prize on the medias or some
jounalists *before* they do on the govt, it might very well undercut
many of the counterattack any govt might have.
Among the ways a govt would have to circumvent that might be:
- create their own medias and have tight security and anonymity
- forbid the press from reporting certain events
- etc.
(Again, many counter arguments have as a basic premise that the populace is stupid.  I do not believe the contrary, I simply say that I do not know.  Future will show.)
So, to see how AP will make the system evolve, you have to assess
the communication capabilities of govt vs the individual.  This is
central to AP and the nature of actual govts.  This is *why* the
internet is *so* dangerous to any govts that seek to either retain or
increase their power, even if it actually touches only but a tiny portion of world population.
For the first time in the history of humanity, we have a peer to
peer communication capability and an individual-to-world broadcasting
capability that is not controllable in practice by any other entity
(such as law, high finance, etc)

The nature of anonimity, IMO, precludes any legal mechanism since the anonymity structure was established precisely to avoid any legal Here, I might be tempted to differeciate between two cases:

  The involved party would then have to resort to use some sort of unofficial tribunal.  It would create a set of parrallel law system, and as much of them as there would be groups doing business together.
Again, depending on the context, AP might wery well be the only solution or be no workable solution at all.
But here, I think that AP would be the single most important factor
ruling the socio-economical behavior of individuals or entities in
the world.  It already works that way in many countries of the
world, especially in south america.  In many places, you don't screw
around too much or you get killed.  As a friend of mine who lived in
the jungle told me "if a guy fools around with you wife, you just
shut up and take it, but if a guy fools around with your girlfriend,
you have the sorcerer mix you a beverage...  One of my friend had
one and he died within ten days..."
He said: "This system might very well go against our common moral
principles, but in theses places, you can leave anything on the
public place for several days and when you come back, it'll still be
there.  In theses countries, when you give your word, it *is*
binding.  Most business deals are simply verbal and there is an
astonishing low level of defaulting on them.  Thoses who tend to
default dishonestly tend very much to die quickly.  In thoses
countries, no con man ever survives."

I don't think that you'd deliver completely anonymously a bulldozer or any other physical goods to some "anonymous" address.

Well, you might have a point.  And I hope so.  The AP scheme finds its
uses mainly against govts or non-anonymous large entities that are
perceived as coercive in nature.  I do not think that it will become
prevalent in the inter-individual interactions.
What I hate about the scheme is that I see it being used for pulling
down peoples that are too good at what they do.  I never pretended
that petty feelings, jalousy and envy does not exists.  I can see at
least half of the business peoples putting a price on another half of
a given field.  I personnally believe that most peoples were thaught

common euphemism "to redistribute wealth"?  Or in straight talk,
should we distribute free-lunches that were took away at the point

Not because they don't live in a rich suburb, simply because they cannot pay for it.  Breathing air does not entitle you to anything that is produced by another breather of air...

I always give my time to any kid that needs help, wether he is 5 years old in first grade or 25 in university.  But why stick a gun in my back to get part of my paycheck?
Yes, absolutely.
At whose expense?
You'd be surprized how so many peoples just don't care.  We have here a *free* education system up to high school.  Then college, which is not very expensive.  Then university that cost around 2000$(US) per year.  But still, we have one of the highest rate of dropping out in the world.  And all collectivists their with grand schemes wonder why...
Agreed.  But you are building a worst straw man.  The only reason is
that we should not turn some productive individuals into a milk cow
for thoses that are less productive.  And the source of the whealth
necessary for your grand schemes are those most productive
individuals turned into sacrificial animals.  Under any governmental
red tape pile of paper lies a GUN.
But again, some other peoples think that true democracy, i.e. the dictature of the majority, wouldn't be better, mainly because the issues are too numerous and the individual's knowledge is too limited.  Some Cypherpunks want, is "Live and let live", some other "Live and let die" and a few even proposed "Live and let live, of get killed" or "mind your own business or get a prize on your head"... I lived on that for several years.  It was not easy but I could still learn and read.  Actually, it is almost the sole thing I did during theses years.  And I am not talking about our almost free education system.  Absolutely.  Why is it that my friends always got straight A's while I got C's or D's...
What somersault of rationalization made you conclude that?
Thoses with more money can *afford* more.  Only that fact.
What you are telling here is that education is *only* a direct function of wealth and that wealth is strictly a direct function of education.  I am sorry to tell you that reality clearly show that this basic premise is not true.

thrive.  Most "donation" here would not be 2 bucks but rather 20,000
bucks to ensure that the contract would get taken up promptly.  And
since the targets would not be published, there would be not even a
hint that company ANON1234 *might* have put a contract on John Doe
(Now, aka Joe Anon9876) .  The fact that an open AP server exists
makes the later possibility also possible.  To have access to the
target list would require to be member of a *very* close circle, or
maybe, actually, just en employee of ANON_KILLERS4567_Inc.
Reputation is standing on the fact that an entity disclose it's existence, accepts to act in full view of significant others, and is
prepared to show evidence of good conduct to said significant others.
And also on the fact that a challenger to the reputation have to put
his own on the opposite platter of the balance.
Anonymity makes it hard to do.

Pardon my ignorance, but I had a few questions haunting me since a Is there a way to have a remailer de-localize itself and relocalize itself over the internet?
For example, could there be several machines around the worlds that,
when you send an e-mail to it, is routed to differents physical
places of the world depending on where the actual remailer process is
actually running?  Could there be such a thing as a virtual machine
runing a remailer that gets to hop from physical machine to physical
machine around the world?
Just an idea to avoid jurisdiction problems.
Just asking, probably quite futilely...

Not in AP.  Because the aim when using AP against government or any other entity is not to get rid of it by killing it's members, but rather to get rid of it by scaring any individual that would participate to it.

Sorry Vlad Z. Nuri, but this message was intended for Cypherpunks,
to be cc'd to you.
Unfortunately, I wrongly addressed it.
To CPunks: the reply that should have hit CPunks:
there is no ethical basis for killing.
please kindly keep your trash out of my mailbox
I've evaluated all sides of the story, and am
not influenced by corrupt machiavellianism
-------Original Message Follows -------
I think that you are writing way out of context.  First, wether or not the AP scheme is used for the control of government, as Jim Bell pushes it, does not mean that it will not be
implemented for other purposes, such as killing successful businessman
or your neighboor's son who is screwing your wife (noticed that she
smiles all the time since a while? ) .
Second, everybody like Jim Bell who is pushing the AP scheme is doing
so on ethical basis: that the coercion the government imposes on to
the individuals by regulations, and guns backed taxation justifies the
killings.  I have to see yet any cypherpunks who seems to agree with
AP that envision another use than govt control.
Third, you will notice that even Jim Bell discusses issues of anonymous transactions and businesses that, if conducted properly,
makes the AP scheme irrelevant.  So, it seems that AP is only a tool
instead of being an end in itself.
Fourth, you lack some basic psychological insight: intrinsic murderers do enjoy the knowledge of the details of their actions and
the derived perception of power.  AP prevents that by anonymising
everything: a donator cannot know if he caused the death of somebody
(unless he spends several tens of grands himself, but then, there are
other, more satisfying ways for a power seeker to fullfill his
passions...) .
You seems to oppose the proposed violence entailed by AP but you
positively blank out what everybody who reflected on AP put in the
opposite pan of the balance, i.e. the ethical standards of
contemporary govt actions.
And you'll also note that the anonymity issue generate more interest
from more CPunks because it (hopefully) will acheive the same goal
without any killing.
Until you accept to evaluate both side of the story, your recriminations opinions are as evident as the magnetic monopole...

I somehow agree with you here.
Well, here, you are threading on a very difficult path.  Of course, the ends does never justifies the means in an *uncoerced* context.  But what JB says, is that AP would be a justified "self defense" against coercion.  It is only that the self-defense uses statistics.  You'll note that the psycho-epistemology necessary to commit murder is quite close to the one necessary to coerce poeples to pay taxes.
Thus, he might pretend (JB) to only turn the living expression of an idea against itself.

Is there a Detweiller FAQ somewhere?
Interesting.  Has AP ever popped-up in the conventional medias?
Then, again, I know an awfull lot of people who would applaude Bell.  But most of them are not computer litterate.  They are from another generation, not brainwashed by "Don't ask what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country"...
[Black humor] any AP proponents with an eye (or a buck) on you?  :)
Please, do point out the similarities and the differences... I think that the context is very different.
Are you talking of an open war a la Bosnia?  This is what I was talking about taking things out of context.  Since you agree on that, the Cherokee thing is ruled out.  But govt action are a matter of the present and future.  Some peoples see it as legitimate self-defense.
Among the peoples who do not object to be coerced to pay taxex for services are two groups the one that:
a) figure out that they get more than they pay
b) want to pay, even if they realize they get less than they pay for.
the a) group is much bigger than b).  At least by an order of Now, in a world where the govt would not use coercion on economical and fiscal matters, b) would keep giving.  But what a) would do? What they've already done since a hundred years: push for legislation that favor them.
Please state the basic premise that make you declare what is "wrong"
in the context of AP.  I am not bugging you simply to do so.  For
example, do you think that, for ethical reasons, you are not only
justified but actually *obligated* to use physical violence in
certain contexts?  I guess not.  But many peoples think they have
I think that you simply try to evade the necessity of defining for yourself what exactly is what the govt is doing.
Personnally, I did not reach any conclusions yet.
General opinion is not what define truth nor reality.  If I refuse
to pay my taxes, they'll use physical violence to get what they
want.  You might object that I enjoyed the benefits of the spending
of taxes, but I am yet to see any contract that I entered with
This scheme is *not* an oligarchy.  Pay a visit to any good dictionary near you.  Words have precise meaning and it is *much* better to stick to it...
Actually, since it is ruled by money, it might be a "buckarchy", but again, everybody can spare a few bucks, so it might be a democracy too if you insist on twisting the meaning of words.
At first look, of course.  But operationnally, you have to consider the mind of the statist to figure out the likeliness of their using the system? I do not deny that it is very likely that a few statists will use the system.  But most won't because they don't like to slain their milk cows.
Remember, we are idea-processing machines.
Many peoples cannot stand to see any opinions that differs from theirs.  But why care at all be read by such peoples?

I don't think Slick W. will make it pop-up.  They know damn well that no matter what the media might pretend the population thinks, there will be enough peoples more than willing to spend a few bucks to cause major joepardy.
Theses peoples refuse to register their guns, although it is mandatory in canada (to be registered within 7(?) years...)
So, are you saying that you chose to not endorse Bell's system because you fear you'd be a target?  Just asking...
You did not answer my question:  When our local Mohawks accuse the white peoples to have stolen their land, I ask "when did I do that?  I can't remember..."  I refuse to be held responsible for things that were done several hundred years ago.  Period.  As I said, I *never*, not even in my early years, believed in original sin.  What I meant is "do you believe that the AP scheme can lead to such events?"  I personnally believe that in the event AP is used against govt, no statist will be able to retaliate.  They might possibly make a few examples, but nobody will get fooled.  Anyways, since the system is completely delocalized, there is no target to aim at.  And furthermore, I think JB is right in saying that the middle-management level is much more likely to be hit first.  But thoses affluent statists are not middle-management. You have to figure out who will be targeted, and what are their means of reprisal.
Well, pardon my lack of imagination but I never found out too many effective ones.  I'll be delighted to consider any alternative you propose.  Encryption and anonymity tools *are* widely discussed and could make AP obsolete (hopefully).
I am sorry, but I do not accept that as a valid argument.  What if somebody came to take away your means of feeding your kids?
What if somebody was menacing you or your kids?
There are instances, as you seem to agree, when killing is justified. What is meant by the sentence is: Thou shalt not initiate lethal violence.  This is the dilemna that peoples in pre-war germany faced.  I met a
wonderfull old german gentleman who worked on the german radar
during the war.  I asked him about how Hitler was perceived by the
general thinking population.  He said that 60% of the population
tought very little of him, and did not agree with war.  Theses were
the educated germans.  But at the same time, since Hitler rallied
the other 40% of the population, the thugs at heart, they lived in
constant fear.  Nobody dared to say anything because nobody came
back from some interrogations...
And I was told the exact same thing by a previous girlfriend of mine, doing her PhD in chemistry.  She was iranian.  She had an irakian boyfriend for a while.  They were madly in love.  but what a fuss it made...  Anyhow, she told me that while in high school, seven of her schoolmate, sixteen years old girls, were taken from the classes by Khomeiny's political police.  Nobody, friends nor family, heard of them ever again.
AP simply turn the ethics of assasins toward other like minded.
Unfortunately, it can turn said mind toward valuable peoples too.  And this is good reason to object.
If you agreed to be taxed, then, maybe not.  But suppose it is: what
are the essentials of theft and what are the justified actions
againts it?  Now, does a kid stealing apples the same as the state
stealing individual's earned wealth ?  Does the same measure apply? Is the offense comparable?  (You must first define the exact context
of each)
In the case of govt, it have the legal monopoly on the use of
violence.  And it does not seem to hate using it.  But if you shoot
some govt official who decided that he wanted you PGP key or your
gun, you'll pay for it dearly even if you win in court.  The most
precious thing in life is time.  And the way we found, as rationnal
animals, to exchange time is to condense time into money.  Money is
an abstraction for productive time of our life.  The govt is working
very hard, at the victims expense, to make anything that can act as
a lock illegal.  And they enforce that with guns. So, do not surprize
yourself if many people find AP fully justified or is the only way left to them.
I do not advocate AP, notwithstanding what some others pretend (LD?). I
think that inducing the death of govt as we know it by financial
starvation through encrypted transactions is the way.  But I also
think that AP is impossible to prevent from happening because so
much peoples agree with the preceding paragraph.
Sorry, I don't have an english-french dictionnary.  But I think it means "might lead to" or "might imply".
Grand Larousse en 5 Volumes, Vol 4, p. 2229 : (I translate from
Oligarchy: noun, feminine. (gr: oligarkhia) 1) political system in
which power is held by a small number of individuals who constitutes
either the intellectual elite (aristocracy) or the owning minority
(plutocracy ?), theses two aspect often coinciding.  2) when a
minority accaparates a power or an authority.
I have to do some more thinking on that.  I concede that I used the
wrong words.  To me, even if AP would fit the operationnal definition
of oligarchy, it is not.  Maybe because the definition had as a basic
premise that it is impossible to structure power without
communication. I think that anonymity technologies might force a
re-definition of the word in more precise terms.  In AP, it is
completely different in the sense that nobody agrees to the ideas of
other peoples.  They simply pass *their own* judgment using *their
own* reason and make *their own* decision to put a few bucks on this
or that head.  In oligarchy, the "intellectual elite" share some
common premises, ideas.  In AP, although you can derive a probability
distribution of the values held by the anonymous donators, they do
not actively share ideas.  And neither do the assassins.  There is no
collusion, no exchange of information, no peer pressure, no
conspiracy, no nothing.
The only factor is the wealth a given donator is willing to donate.  And
this makes it a "buckarchy", i.e. the ideas and values of peoples
who made it to wealth are statistically more likely to be
implemented.  But again, it is only a statistical, macroscopical
truth.  Only, theses peoples achieved wealth by sticking to a
certain type of values (considering that it takes years to
build a reputation and seconds to destroy it); they must have a stong
tendency toward a set of values that are pro-freedom, pro-economy,
and pro-productivity.  Laissez-faire, the french expression, means
"let do".
But OTOH, if you remain silent, you'll attract no one.
Faith: zero, zip, none...
(Did you read the complete AP essay?)
Yes.  But you also have to recognize that *never* in the history of mankind a media like the net ever existed.  The net is, IMO, a turning point in the history of humanity, just as the discovery of toolmaking was.  I think it will change the human history even more than the invention of the printing press.
A few questions here: Why any statists would want to target *you*?
There are plenty of guys like you who hates the guts of govt, have
big mouths,  and they don't get offed.  By being a C'punk, it is even
more dangerous for them: if they try to make an example by killing
you, the others CPunks will go underground, set up AP remailers and
get rid of them.  At least, they recognize that the last thing to do
in such circumstances, is to make martyrs.  Compare the number of
active posters to the number of readers, and you'll see that a lot of
C'punks stay in the shadow, without making any waves.  Now, to deal
with that volume of e-mail, one must have *some* sort of interest. Unless the silent majority *all* work for NSA... PLEASE NOTE: THIS POST DOES NOT MEAN THAT I ENDORSE MR. BELL'S

He might be wrong, but you seem to bring no new knowledge that would elucidate the question.
Should the US have not dropped the A-Bomb on Japan and let happen 10 times mores casualties (from both sides)?
The following paragraphs illustrate very well the way our local Rotweiller sees the world, which is very close to the vision of most Why do you fear so much for yourself?  I guess, thoses who want to murder for all sort of reasons like hunting white baby seals or smoking in public simply share your psycho-epistemology.  They would have no reasons to put a contract on you.  Or would they anyways?
By definition, you are right.  But note that *they* never advocated
true anarchy, only *you* claim that they do.
Their vision of Life clearly entail some vision of Rights, Rules of Conduct, etc.  They did *not* rule out laws, they only said that they do not like laws that are there to oppress peoples.  Now, might you say, how are you gonna know?  Because your philosophy is somewhat of a cross between Nietche and Sartre, you see no way out.  But they (proponents of AP) have a vision of life that value, as the good old american constitution say, life, liberty and "pursuit of happiness".
I might even agree with you, dear Rotty, that Jim Bell is a bit
naive and shows a kind of outdated philosophy.  Jim Bell et al. entertain the delusion that human beings are intrinsically joyous rationnal animals that, most of the time, love life.  Therefore, for them, the AP scheme cannot lead to anything but a kind of laissez-faire world where everybody would be able to pursue happiness to the best of their abilities.  OTOH, you believe that the natural tendency of AP would bring a
world as you describe it vocally here.  A world where the essence of
Mankind is not to be a rationnal animal, but an animal, period.  In
that vision, you believe that a bloodthirsty beast within us will
always take over.  Maybe you learned that truth from your *own* life
experience, I have no idea.  So, according to your logic, anybody
who doesn't like you will put a prize on your head, and probably look
up the necrology section of the paper everyday while gigling.  And
here, I have to conceed that you may be right.
After all, what philosophy ran the country since a hundred years?
Huhh?  So many peoples are so convinced of that that AP might very well turn against it's originator and further corruption.  Don't you think so?  That sentence should earn one of the top spot of the CP

Under every pile of red-tape lies a fully loaded gun.  And *this* is what gives govt employees their attitude toward you.

But that is the principle by which AP operates.  That *is* the whole point that seems to miss you: encryption technologies makes that perfectly feasible.  I agree that it is a novelty in the history of During the transition period, definitely.
Why, is it becoming too hot?  Are you tempted to send the cops at Jim Bell's place?
Against *whom* will they retaliate?  And more down to earth, I bet
that in the advent of AP becoming operationnal, their leaders will
go down even faster than our own.

Since you said yourself that the actual govt will *never* relinquish power, I find that statement a bit of a contradiction.

But, my dear, even in the most libertarian or AP-ruled world, they would absolutely free to give away *all* of their salary for the causes they consider valid.  Only, thoses who don't agree with them would not be coerced into thoses noble causes.
This paragraph seems to indicate that the only difference between
libertarians and socialist is a mere difference of opinion and that
everybody is justified to act on their beliefs.  But the socialists
who pretend that are simply blanking out the fact that *they too*
recognize that Reality Is since they want to use force to get a
lunch out of the mouth of somebody who have one (and who happened to
produce it himself) to put it in the mouth of another who didn't
have.  Therefore, it is OK to deny reality when somebody come up
with arguements against socialism, but it is darn convenient to use
it (in the form of a loaded gun...)
BTW, they do not "ostensibly" form the state.  They simply *do*not*coerce* individuals into being sacrificial animals for the unearned benefits of others...
Oh, you mean, "for them, anybody who pass a judgment of his own that contradict them should be killed"  I see...
I'd prefer a pink elephant with wings.  Do you think that govt does not target peoples?
JB seem to agree with the view that turning our most productive
individuals into sacrificial animals for the benefit of the less
productive is not exactly a kind thing to do.  I tend to agree.
To say "commensurate" means that you must quantify various things in their proper context.  I invite you to do so.
It does not legitimates murder per se.  I don't think that JB ever said that murder was legitimate.  He only explained that the technology makes it inevitable to happens and that he believes that the outcome will be a better society.  You will note that to the act of murdering, he opposed many other actions, including many that leads to direct loss of lives.  He claims that the positives will outnumber the negatives.  As to the morality, by your own standards, of starting a "Vietnam" war, I suppose it is highly questionnable, or so you seems to indicate.
Jim Bell does not believe that AP will evolve in a moral vacuum.  On
the contrary (and most collectivists think he is wrong), I think he
believes that human beings have an intrinsic sense of justice and
that this will prevail.
Well, of course, our perception of reality is context dependent.  But you seems to attempt to hint that truth is relative because knowledge is contextual.  It looks like an attempt on reason.  I think that by the nature of AP, this would be ruled out.  Maybe there would be a fanatic president, but he would preside nothing because nobody would be there to enforce his fanatic views.  That is absolute BS.  It might have been true before, but with the
advent of the net and of computers and smart cards, it is becoming a
fallacy.  If Visa or Mastercard can operate on a voluntary basis,
the govt could also do it.  The technology makes it possible
that any individual who wish to subscribe to any of the various
insurances the govt could offer might do so.  Including contributions to
finance museums, research projects, etc.  And mandatory taxes could
be enforced in period of emergencies like wars, if ever they
happens.  The population seems to have a very short memory: Before the great
wars, there was *no* income tax.  It is mainly with the advent of
socialism, coinciding with the nuclear era, that the taxes were hiked
to the level they are now.  Johnson blew up whatever Eisehower tried
to do.  Of course, it started before them but Eisehower tried to get
back to the old system.  I guess what defeated him what that too many
poeples longed for a free lunch...
Anyhow, we have the technology to institutes a card that would give access to most services like health care, unemployement insurance, etc.  Why don't they put it in place?

It has similarities.  But AP will not be the enforcer of *one* opinion.  And, according to Jim Bell, people will realize that the best way to behave is to adopt a low profile.
Again, this is where I do not agree with JB, although I cannot say I disagree.  I simply do not know.
Maybe, since the basis for sustenance of human life is production, and since the majority has to be producers, the majority will endorse more libertarians ideas.
But again, maybe Joe Average was so convinced that "the rich" owe him
a free lunch that AP will lead to complete destruction of the system.
I personnally tend to believe that Joe Average still has some common sense and integrity.

Your second paragraph is attacking a straw man.  You even included the word
'capitalist' in double quotes (").  The common point between socialists and
theses so-called "capitalists" is that they both use that fact that some
coercion is enacted on a given population to get rich an/or powerful.  The socialists seek, as a value, power over producers and your "capitalists"
seek to get rich and/or powerfull. But both blank out the cause of the
obtention of their goals: legally exerted coercion (via govt rules and
powers).  To use terms coined by a well known writer, one is a Witch Doctor,
the other is an Attila (morally sanctionned by the Witch Doctor).  They
natures are not opposite, they are simply both sides of the same coin.
I sometimes wish peoples would use words for what they really mean...

Prostitution was virtually always repressed.  But was it ever eradicated?  Only, the odds are immensely stacked in favour of AP as long as *any* kind of e-$ exists.

The example of Columbia is completely out of context.  Some dictators were replaced by other dictators, both being different sides of the same coin.
In Columbia, any member of the gang of drug cartels could be identified and
get targeted by peaceful citizens the same way they would target politicians. AP would thus stop street terror.  AP is not against govt per se, it is
something acting against any opressing "leadership", whomever it might be.  Jim Bell's conviction being that the human animal is basically a reasonnable
animal that enjoys life, AP, IHHO, will bring a world in which the golden rule
will be "live and let live (or die).... or get killed".  Here, "live and let live (or die)" is opposed to "live and make die (or live)" The operative is *let* versus what we currently have now: "make"
Jim Bell, as it is evident by his writings, believe that the word "freedom"
means "to be free from other men".  In that sense, an I think that I am quoting him, he claims that anarchy is not "the lack of order" but rather the "lack of Jean-Francois Avon, Pierrefonds (Montreal) QC Canada

Like this one with "Anonymous" going on.  And a few others lately.  Some clueless or semi-outsiders seems to drop in the group and sling mud to detract every active participants from the other topics discussed (usually, more to the point with CP).  I am not ranting about the answering, I'm simply puzzled by the phenomenon.  Just like, as a rule here in Canada, every time the country is really going down and that everybody start getting fed-up of the govt, suddenly the debate on death penalty or abortion or racial equality or salary inequality among sexes just pops-up.  Every times, it looks it happened purely as an happenstance but every time, there was something very fishy going on at another level.

Mr. Bell pushing the AP scheme does not mean that he wants to impose his ideas by force since he will have *no* mean of controlling what ideas will be favored.  It is strictly market forces that will dictates what will happens.  As many, including Mr. Bell have pointed out, he might very well be one of the first victim of the AP system.
Mr Bell is pushing AP because he believe that the bulk of human race wants to live peacefully and he therefore concludes that AP, being led by the demand of ordinary people, will lead to a more peacefull world.  When you'll get to learn how AP operates, your conclusions of an AP regulated world will, IMO, be dependent on the specifics of your definition of human race.
As I mentionned in my other post to you, this is not a reference since the operating mode of AP is entirely different.
Again, absolutely irrelevant to AP.  Go read the book again.
No, it is not surprizing at all, but you did not seem to have understood why:  1) The dissatisfaction of the population is such that many would actively seek where to send their buck to have somebody 2) The way AP works, journalists would be priviledged victims, paid for by the same disgruntled population
3) More than everything else, they (the journalists) probably
understood *exactly* how AP works and thus fully realised point 2)
That would be the best way of promoting AP.  Every peoples who favor it would say: "Go ahead, it'll be our pleasure!"  AP will not die for several reason.  The first one is that it only requires knowledge and a little coding.  The second is that there is a demand.  Prostitution could never be eliminated.  Yet, it does not menace the system itself.  AP will be tougher than prostitution and it will probably actively seek the system's destruction (as we know I suggest you try to understand the mechanics of AP.

I don't think that any of them will complain because they understand the nature of it.  I think that Jim Bell (forgive me Jim...:) view that there will be only limited retaliation from government is not guaranteed at all.  As I said somewhere previously, the whole thing will depend on how the authorities view AP as (non-) attackable.  Here is the post I wrote earlier:
------- earlier post -------
I don't agree here.  It would all be a matter of timing, unless the
number of AP servers would be sprouting out faster than police forces
would be able to destroy them.  You have to realize that if the money
is seized, noboby will be willing to make a hit since the odds of
being paid are not too good.  Just play the game "Command and Conquer"
for a while and you'll see.  Money is fuel.  Don't run off of it!
For that reason, I think that any AP server, *at the introduction of
the concept*  would have to be a covert operation.  Servers could come out in
public light when their number be large enough to warrant a
strike on anybody trying to eliminate them.  Same for the
publication of the name of the individuals operating the server.
To me, this seems obvious.  Comments?
To go on along that line, I had the idea that a specific piece of
software, a bit like Private Idaho, that would chain remailers but
that would be specifically designed to handle predictions, would
have be designed.
(Pardon my ignorance of the net here)
The server need not to be a unique address.  Actually, the
prediction and any accompanying documents could be splitted a la
Secure Split, and sent to N differents servers, M (<N) of which
would be required to re-assemble the original prediction.  This
assures that if one gets closed, the other can rebuild the message.
If thoses servers were set up on *large* machines servicing tens of
thousands of messages a day, preferably located at a busy remailer
location, any exchange of information between them to rebuild the
prediction at a central location would not be easy to track by any ----- end of earlier post -----

I agree with the prediction but the cause will probably not be AP.  AP could probably be run from BBS and direct link over a very informal and loose network made out of individual modem connections.  I think it is very unlikely it would get succesfully stopped.  It could even be run from physically exchanged diskettes.  It would run slowly, but still, it would run.
OTOH, the "Maysian" crypto anarchy will be a much more immediate
problem to govts.  "L'argent est le nerf de la guerre",or, loosely
translated:  "money is war's fuel" as we say...  When they start getting financially starved, they'll have to increase taxation but the population already have them in very low esteem...
AP, with a properly structured media campaing, will make govts
heroes, Maysian anarchy will make them seen as looters.

For the payer, the ammount involved is so small that he might thing
it is worth a shot to put the price of two bottles of beer "just in
case" it works.  As the system gets known, it'll gain reputation.
For the hitman, this is another story, but there is a way.  AP, a
sensationalistically choosen name (No, Jim, I know... you intended
it only as a joke) very badly describes what the server does.
It could accept donations for all sorts of things, many of them
being legally unconsequential.  So, a potential hitman group could
make donations for anybody who would predict any kind of event and
see if they would pay.  The server could not even know if these
would be integrity tests or legitimate donations. IMO, there is only one way to prevent AP: it is by preventing the advent of e-cash.  Making it illegal to issue such currency, and seize and prosecute heavily if any of it is found.  This would includes, of course, gold (or other material value) e-tokens, etc.  It will come from a total control of money.  Can it be done?  I doubt it very stronly.

Comments from Canada: Libertarians usually attibutes the reference to
the christian cult in the US constitution  as some sort of
psycho-epistemological failure or ill-weighed concession to the
peoples beliefs of the time.  IMO, it is a major flaw that led to
the actual state of affairs.   Causes have effects.  A is A and you cannot run away from the Nature of things.
Factually, they are one hell of a big pressure group trying to ram their personnal convictions down the throat of others, with a legalized gun to back them up.  I don't ask that you love eating Cheez-Whiz with corn syrup and peanut butter with a dash of Tabasco sauce so don't ask me to start eating your stuff.
I would be surprized.  Ultimately, in their deep nature, they are all as evil.  A is A.  You will not, in the long run, be able to avoid the effects of their nature.
The degradation perceived by whom?  He might be slightly harsher than others, but you discount the good laughs that it also gives to some others.  Actually, you should rejoice at 'Monger's opinions; doesn't your code of moral preach spreading the well of others at the expense of your own?  If not, then, tsk tsk tsk...
Sorry, but you disqualify for such thing.  The psycho-epistemology of religions makes it impossible.  Your axiomatic belief of God invalidates all logics.  Therefore, each time you request a "logically thought out" explanation, you commit the act of concept stealing, i.e. you use the end result of a philosophy to try to invalidate it.  But you know, what you saw in cartoons, the vacuum cleaner sucking itself into nothing or the snake eating it's tail and disappearing, it just doesn't exist...  Reality (with a capital R) doesn't work that way.  Sorry.
You mean, "to get a ride on the gravy train, enforced under the treath of violence at the point of the governmental gun" ?
Again, instead of using "moral duty", you use the word, "obligation".
Coercion galore!
... according to some standards...
Here, I tend to agree on your sentence but I have a hunch that our basic justifications are quite far...
Morality, according to cultists, is to be defined by the worshipped entity.  To free-living rationnal individuals, it should be defined according to the most accurately understood Nature of Man.
Most observer of the later would agree that parental supervision is necessary.  But also, most of thoses parents would agree that Freedom is required for man to live as Man, i.e. as a rationnal animal.
[This paragraph left intentionally unfinished]
Why "unfortunately" ? because it doesn't not suit your teleological slave mentality or because you truly care about other young Human Animals?  Personnally, it is because of the later reason.
the relevancy of this disclosure baffles me.
Who proclaimed such obligation?  The whole attempt at censorship is an attempt to make peoples accept this "obligation".  There is no way to bring a slave out of slavery when they willingly forge their own Here is a long term solution that would solve the problem definitely: to promulgate that everybody being offensed by the content of the net gets neutered.  That way, they won't have to worry about their children's viewing habits...
The acceptability of this solution passes all the tests that the one you propose does.  If you have any arguments that does not have at it.s base, the negation of Reason, i.e. non-contradictory identification, then, give it your best shot.

I have to slightly disagree on the quoted sentence, extracted from an otherwise super extra excellent post.
IMO, life is not a crapshoot, it simply "is".  Reality Is.  So, you just have to deal with it.  Now, arguing about the non-existence of Good or Bad, you interestingly use your own scale of Good and Bad.  So, clearly, there *is* some sort of standard.
Only, you seems to hold as a basic premise that the standard can not be codified because it doesn't meet the simplicistic criterias that you describe.   please don't build a straw man and shoot it down The sentence "Well, it works in theory but it doesn't in practice" is absolute bullshit and an attempt at invalidating reason.  Which
theoretician with a milligram of self respect would come up with a theory that comes in contradiction to the best observation of Reality we can do?  My own rule about morality is the following: any rule that is good for the harmonious development and life of the Human Animal is a good one.  Anything that has an effect contrary to the first rule is "bad".  And there are many things that are neither good or bad also.
Now, good and bad are highly context dependent.  In your example, you show a situations where some peoples made context-dependent decisions while not fully analysing the context.  To do such analyse requires efforts and time, which are not always available.  You then proceed to build scenario inquiring more deeply in the context of the situation and figure out that the decision *might* have been wrong.
So, clearly, you *do* have some standard underlying your statements.

its officials on loan to the United Nations for the past 27 years in
violation of the U.N. Charter, a national daily reported Sunday. Officials from Japanese ministries and agencies on loan to the world

officials dispatched to international institutions be paid 70 to 100% of
the salaries paid in Japan, took effect in 1971, the Mainichi said. The U.N. Charter and U.N. staff regulations ban receiving payment from
any government to maintain its independence. An official at the National Personnel Authority was quoted as saying
half the Japanese officials on U.N. assignments are paid 100 % of their
home salary amount. Tsukasa Kawada, director of the Foreign Ministry's U.N. Administration

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 18, 1997
JAMES D. BELL PLEADS GUILTY TO OBSTRUCTING THE IRS AND USING FALSE SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBERS
United States Attorney Kate Pflaumer announced that JAMES DALTON BELL, 39,
pleaded guilty today in the federal court in Tacoma to two felony charges.
BELL, a resident of Vancouver, Washington, pleaded guilty to obstructing and
impeding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and to falsely using a social
security number with the intent to deceive.  United States District Court
Judge Franklin D. Burgess presided over today's proceedings.
The charges stem from an investigation initiated in October, 1996 by IRS
Internal Security Inspectors into reports that BELL was gathering the names
and home addresses of IRS employees. In previous court hearings, IRS
Inspectors testified that BELL had obtained the names and home addresses of
70 IRS employees as part of  "Operation LocatIRS." In the eight page plea
agreement signed by BELL, he acknowledged that he had gathered the names and
addresses of the IRS employees in order to intimidate them in the
performance of their official duties.
During the course of their investigation, IRS Inspectors discovered that
BELL was advocating a scheme called "Assassination Politics", whereby
persons would be rewarded with "digital cash" for killing certain
undesirable people.  BELL identified these undesirables as government
employees, such as IRS employees, who would be intimidated from enforcing
internal revenue laws for fear of being assassinated.  In the plea
agreement, BELL admitted that he suggested using "Assassination Politics" as
an enforcement mechanism for the "Multnomah County Common Law Court", and
that this was part of his effort to obstruct and impede the enforcement of
internal revenue laws.  In affidavits previously filed in this case, IRS
investigators identified BELL as a participant in the "Multnomah County
Common Law Court", which was described as a self-appointed anti-government
extremist group which purports to hold "trials" of IRS and other Government
employees for the performance of their official duties.  The affidavits
indicated that in January, 1997 the "Multnomah County Common Law Court" held
a "trial" of IRS and other Government officials.  In the plea agreement, BELL also admitted that on March 16, 1997, he
conducted a chemical "stink bomb" attack on the IRS office in Vancouver,
Washington, using the noxious chemical mercaptan.  In affidavits filed with
the Court, IRS Inspectors tied BELL to two previous mercaptan attacks
against non-government targets: one being a lawyer's office in 1984, and the
other a vehicle in 1989.  The IRS investigators also linked BELL to two
purchase orders for noxious chemicals, one in 1994 and one in 1996.
According to the plea agreement, the attack on the IRS office resulted in a
cost to the government of $1,359, and caused a number of IRS employees to
have to leave work.  In an affidavit previously filed in this case, IRS
Inspectors indicated that the mercaptan attack may have been linked to the
February 20, 1997 seizure of BELL's vehicle by the IRS for unpaid taxes.
As part of the plea agreement, BELL also admitted that he used several
different social security numbers in order to hide assets from the IRS and
thus to impede the IRS's ability to collect taxes he owed and to prevent the
IRS from levying his wages.
Federal agents had previously executed two search warrants on BELL's
residence.  On April 1, 1997, IRS agents seized computers, documents, and
firearms during a search.  In a follow-up search, the Environmental
Protection Agency seized a variety of dangerous chemicals which had been
discovered during the execution of the  IRS warrant.  BELL was arrested by
IRS Inspectors on May 16, 1997.  BELL continues to be held in custody based
on a May 23, 1997 ruling by Magistrate Judge J. Kelley Arnold that BELL
posed a danger to the community and was a flight risk.
BELL faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine
for the obstruction charge, and five years and a $250,000 fine for using a
phony social security number.
The IRS received assistance in the investigation of BELL from the Portland
Police Bureau, Oregon Department of Justice, Oregon State Police, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and the Vancouver, Washington Police Department.

In that piece of knowledge smashing, just as you do in most of your posts, you again mixed up things to make sure that everybody end up knowing less than when they started.
It is peoples like you that ended up with using Expectation of Privacy out of it's rightfull context.  Apart from various rulings of various judges that probably smoked various  herbs, can you please tell me how anybody can rightfully expect privacy when everything that permits them to exchange information is *owned* by somebody else and that the use of this equipment is there *only* for the activities of the owner of the equipment?  If it weren't of the business, the damn computer wouldn't be there.  And beside, the employee is not paid to chat with friends, he's paid to work.  If he doesn't want to work, just fine, but not on the company's pay...
Somehow, you basic premises always blows my mind.  I think that you are a *very* dangerous person.  I've been watching you for almost three years over Cypherpunks and e$-etc and other forums.   Virtually *all* of your posts have this blow-up-their-basic-premises-and-let-them-with-nothing-but-confusion  style.  Your style shows intelligence and skill in the way you do it, which rules out idiocy on your part.  So, clearly, you have an agenda. I cannot help but having the nagging feeling that you're on  some three-letter agency payroll because you have the uncanny habit of disrupting and diverting some important discussion.  I always wanted to killfile you but always refrained to do so just to be able to read the last finely crafted basic premises-smashing abomination.
So, again, which of the three-letter agency sends you a paycheck?  Or are you doing is only for a secret decoration?

Unicorn, as usual, you twist words like nobody but you (and a zillions politicians) can.
You forget the fact that the association between a company and an individual is voluntary.  As long as all the tests and surveillance done by the company is known by the employee, it can do anything it wants.  Only, you are also free to find another employer.  And in the old days of paper correspondence, what prevented a company to give five years of a given employee's correspondence to the FBI?  As a business owner, I wouldn't put cameras in the bathrooms, but I would certainly *require* that an encrypting software be decypherable by the top management.  Encryption is an envelope.  Sometimes, it is justified that management open suspicious enveloppes.  As long as a behaviour doesn't impair work performance, there is no reason to pick on it.  And personnally, I'd maybe keep somebody with impaired work capabilities but negociate a pay reduction instead of firing him/her.  He is free to find work somewhere.  This is *NOT* coercion.
Your thing about the cops having access to info is an entirely different story.  If the company doesn't have the balls or the strenght to resist bullish tactics, then, it is their problems.  The employee should simply have evaluated earlier if the company would sell him out to the first spook and choose to work for somebody else.
What you seemed to imply when you wrote that precisionless paragraph is that, in the end, key escrow by the owners of the company and computer system is dangerous.  But to the company, not having the possibility to decrypt the data they *own* and are liable for  is even more dangerous.
The data generated on company's time and pay is property of the company.  There is no coercion.  Everybody is free to act, find another employee or keep him, find another job or keep it.
P.S.    For which one of three-letter organization do you work

Duhhh!  Typical Unicornish answer: completely out of context.
The agreement with the phone company is to provide you with a service, while the agreement with the employer is for you to devote your time to his cause.  Buy doing personnal activities outside of certain accepted ones, you defraud him.  Did you indulge into calling your girlfriend in Tokyo while in your office? Did you get a pat in the back from your boss?
Duhhh ^2
But does that precludes the requirement by the company that all e-mail pertaining to  company activities be decryptable by them?
Duhhh ^3  I did not said it, you did.  If you want to have a vague idea of my idea of property, just refer to Ayn Rand philosophy for a close enough explanation.
You are almost absolved.  :-)  This anti-knowledge way of interacting is unfortunately widely thaught.  But from the moment you realize it, it becomes a sin again...  :-)
I have no idea because I did not look at it.  Only, from a business standpoint, it doesn't only makes sense to be able to decrypt employees data, it is a sine qua none condition for the implementation of encryption at corporate level.  IMNSHO.
Double talk.  I never said it *owns* the employees, I said it owns the *means* of communication and, as per mutual agreement between employee and employer, the employee's time.  The employee AND the employer are, most of the time, free to walk out anytime.
Accepting a paycheck has nothing to do with selling your soul, it is a contractual agreement.  You have to fullfill it.  It is based on good faith.  There is a large part of happenstance in this.  Doing business with the Nazis is an extreme and many condemned it.  Doing business within the USA is another thing.
I admit you do often.
Oh, but I do not question that you act.  Only, your pretended basic premises and the end result and general philosophy conveyed by most of your comments simply do not match you pretended agenda. At least, we have something in common!  :-)

It can be translated by  "PGP gets into the groove" it "behave itself".  It finally obtemperate (wether prompted or not).  It grow's up and become reasonable.
"se ranger" is what you do with your car when a cop car pulls you on the side.  it gets in line
There is an ambiguity in this expression.  "Se ranger" is usually used for  a transition to an unusual or not approved behaviour to a accepted or acceptable behaviour.  It entails a "higher" authority or standard.  This is why I use a much more americanized language when I speak in french about civil liberties and related subjects.  The french language almost equate government intentions with fatherly love... :-)    Over the years, I found that most French peoples have a feodal attitude with a tendency to almost blind veneration of hierarchy.  (flames to dev at nul.con).  I suppose it comes from their History.  In general, if a govt said it, it *has* to be good.  It is as if they were trained since young age to surrender their capacity for independent judgment and reason.  And quite distressingly, it happens even with extremely intelligent individuals.
OTOH, the uncommon ones that do not exhibit such psycho-epistemological trait tend to be real hot shots, independent type.
I am not French, but Canadian (french) and we often have scrapes with French on this topic.  They tend to trust their govt, unless somethings warrant otherwise.  Here in french Canada, we are much more American in that sense.  Notwithstanding what trumped-up polls say, we have a much more american-styled opinion.

No.  I don't have time to even read all of e$ and e$pam.  I am not yet retired... :-)
Let me describe a scenario: one key employee isn't there because... ...he is somewhere else [ :-) ]
Then, comes an urgent message forcing the company to make a split-second decision before the employee gets back.  It happens _all_the_time_ in small businesses where they do not have the ressource of the big companies.  You, the boss,  want to re-read some critical documents before making a move.  Of course, your employee was the most consciencious and trustworthy employee on this side of Andromeda, only, your memory fails as what was the *exact* wording of the critical documents.  It furthermore happens that the said faithfull employee is, unknown to you and in his mind not-company-detrimental, getting intronized to the mile-high club between L.A and Tokyo in the plane lavatory, therefore not reacheable by any modern means.  Wouldn't you wish you had his corporate private key?
In the old days, you used to scramble through his mountain of paper on his desk.  In more recent days, you frantically scanned his exemplary organized data structure and found the documents.  Today, the said data structure is still exceptionally orderly, but only to reveal several very describing filenames with a  dot-asc or dot-pgp extension.
Any comments?
I thought that this was so self-evident that I did not even thought usefull to explain.
I was not talking about having employees giving copies of their personnal private key but of their corporate private key.  The one they use to transact business over unsecured lines, not the one they use to send raunchy messages to their lover.
I never talked of monitoring e-mail, only of making sure the business retains access to employee-generated documents.  I used to have a private key for the company at a previous work location.  The first thing I did was to give my boss my passphrase for being afraid of what could happens if ever they needed a critical document during my absence.  He did not even know how to use PGP, but I made sure that somebody did.
This is why I said that a "secret" copy would be given to the boss.  He could encrypt the employees keys, print it on a micro-dot and hide it under his gold tooth cap.  And that way, there is always deniability since there is official company policy.  Or better, all the boss has to do is to generate the employee's keys himself.  He could forever deny having made a copy and nobody could prove that he did.
Personnally, I would make sure that all keys to be used to transact business be generated by the boss, to be handed on a diskette in person.
As far as trying to prevent malicious action, I agree that there is no way an employer can do that.  Anybody really intent on screwing up things can.

Re.: recent amendment to Criminal Code, Bill C-95
Did any legal expert analyse the recent amendment to the
Criminal Code regarding  the mere membership in an organization
consisting of more than 5 people which imposes a penalty in prison
from 5 to 14 years if any mischief is even mentioned?
This amendment is aimed at the biker gangs, however, the way it
is worded, it can be applied to any group, be they environmenta-
lists, unionists, recreational firearms owners, birdwatchers or even
stampcollectors where the mere mentioning of mischief is ground
enough to face 5-14 years in jail.
This development here in Canada is truly frightening and is remi-
niscent of a movie called "Judgement at Nuremburg" with Spencer
Tracey and Burt Lancaster, where Burt Lancaster played a
German Judge under Hitler, who applied all kinds of  laws, created
by the Nazis, which were clearly against common sense and
human values and utterly repressive. These laws were pushed
through the German puppet parliament by the then party in
power. We are all aware of what happened in the end to this
regime. Several thousand Canadians, however, had to make the
supreme sacrifice to eliminate this evil and now it rears it's ugly
head here in Canada .
This amendment was the subject of a radio interview this morning
with a defence lawyer on CBC 2. The lawyer was utterly shocked
at what can be done with this legislation and strongly expected a
charter challenge. Unfortunately this will require again enormous
amounts of funds to be wasted in a completely unproductive and
wasteful manner. Why are we constantly running up against laws
which have to be challenged  ?  Why can the new laws not be
drafted in a way that they are charterproof ? Just imagine if we
did not even have the Charter. The people who are drafting the
laws and are getting paid good salaries can not all be idiots ?
And what about the parliamentarians who pass these laws ?
One does not need a gun to destroy a human life, all that is
needed is a repressive law. Let someone with a criminal record
just try to get a job when he comes out of jail.

Forwarded from the Canadian Firearms Digest V1 The first day of court: An application from Clayton Ruby (the Coalition For
Gun Control Lawyer [CFGC]) to have a paper by one Professor Killias admitted
waas denied.  The CFGC had submitted it, then fiddled around to prevent
cross-examination of Prof. Killias.  An earlier judge had then ruled the
paper inadmissible because there was no opportunity for cross-examination.
The Court ruled 3 to 2 to exclude the paper.
Rod McLennan, acting for Alberta, then put Alberta's case.  It quickly
became evident that Chief Justice of Alberta Catherine Fraser had carefully
studied the federal government's case.  She mousetrapped McLennan into a
swamp by asking him why registration of handguns was legitimate, and
registration of rifles and shotguns was not.
Instead of pointing out that the matter of registration of handguns was not
before the court, that the question of the legitimacy of registration of
handguns was an issue that might appear someday before some other court,
that only the opinion of the judge in such a case could settle the
legitimacy or otherwise of handgun registration, and that he could only give
his personal opinion on the matter, McLennan tried to answer her.
He assumed that handguns are intrinsically evil, that registration of
handguns is legal and proper and constitutional.  Those were dubious
assumptions, and only his personal opinions.  He characterized handguns as
having no legitimate purpose, as being used primarily by criminals, and as
legitimate targets for regulation within the criminal law.
The judge then demanded to know why the arguments for registration of
handguns should not apply to rifles and shotguns.  McLennan was reduced to
arguing that the difference between a rifle/shotgun and a handgun was "one
of degree."  He had been mousetrapped into fighting from a bad position that
he could have -- and should have -- refused to move into.
McLennan then recouped his losses by reading into the record a prepared
statement (NOT something uttered in the heat of debate) made by Alan Rock
during his introduction of Bill C-68.  In that statement, he made it very
clear that C-68 is not aimed at criminals, is expected to have no effect on
crime or criminals, but is designed to make our society more "orderly," and
to control property.  In short, he gave a convincing presentation to tell
Parliament that C-68 is REGULATORY law, dealing with PROPERTY issues, and
equating it with automobile registration laws.
Why is that important?
Law is divided into regulatory law and criminal law.  Broadly speaking,
Criminal law prohibits behavior that is evil and damaging to the rights of
others.  Violation of a criminal law is, almost always, punishable by a term
of imprisonment.  Criminal law and its severe punishments are reserved for
the worst evils found in society.  The consitution allocates the power to
make criminal law to the federal Parliament.
Broadly speaking, regulatory law is law that regulates society, prohibiting
behavior that normally will not -- but MIGHT -- have evil or damaging
effects on the rights of others.  Regulatory law is usually NOT punishable
by a term of imprisonment.  Regulatory law and its gentler punishments are
reserved for REGULATION of our society, with the intent to make life easier
and more orderly, and to deal with property issues (e.g., should you be
allowed to own pesticides, or store pesticides where rain can corrode the
containers).  The Constitution allocates the power to make regulatory law --
in fields that existed before Confederation (1867) -- to the provincial
legislatures.  (In fields that did not exist prior to 1867 (e.g., air transport) and fields
that straddle provinces (e.g., marine transport), the Constitution allocates
the power to make regulatory law to the federal government.  Firearms
clearly existed before 1867, and their ownership, possession and use is
local.  Firearms are property.)
Rock's equation of firearms registration with motor vehicle registration is
useful.  Motor vehicle registration is only required for motor vehicles that
travel public roads, not for POSSESSION of motor vehicles.  It is PROVINCIAL
REGULATORY law, not FEDERAL CRIMINAL law.  Imprisonment is NOT a punishment
that can be imposed for violation of a motor vehicle registration law.  When
Rock equated the two in his prepared statement, he largely made the
provincial case.  Registration of firearms may be imposed by government in a
law, but it is fundamentally REGULATORY in nature, not CRIMINAL.  One question that has not been raised yet -- and should be -- is the
question of licensing within the CRIMINAL law.  Bill C-68 criminalizes simple possession of any firearm.  If a person has
possession of any firearm, that is a crime, and his or her behavior is
criminal behavior -- according to Bill C-68.
In Bill C-68, the federal government then offers to SELL the person a
license to commit that crime.  If that concept is worthy of inclusion in the
criminal law, one wonders how far such a precedent may take us.  Will our
government someday be selling licenses to burgle?  To murder?  Obviously, those two suggestions are laughable -- today.  We must, however,
recognize how much laws change over a term of years.  It was not that long
ago that we prosecuted Mafia hirelings for their activities in selling
gambling tickets that gave people chances to win money through the "numbers
racket."  Today, the "numbers racket" has been taken away from the Mafia.  We buy our
tickets legally -- from the federal government -- and the renamed "numbers
racket" is called Lotto 6/49.  Oddly enough, the Mafia used to give us
better odds than the federal government does today.
When one looks at licensing the commission of crimes, the problems become
clear.  If the criminal law is reserved for dealing with crimes and criminal
behavior -- the sort of evils that have major damaging effects on the rights
of others -- then how can such bad behavior be legitimized by selling a
license to commit the crime to any applicant?  Either the behavior is not
that evil -- in fact, is perfectly acceptable in our society -- or the
selling of the license to engage in the behavior is wrong.
True, the C-68 system contains ways to deny the license; but it is
unequivocal that the license is available, that the behavior is NOT
intrinsically evil, and that the government expects huge numbers of
Canadians to buy the license.  The "evil" behavior is acceptable -- yet it
is a crime.  There is something wrong here.
There is something very disturbing about the selling of licenses to commit
crimes.  One cannot help but feel that either the behavior is not truly
criminal behavior, or, alternatively, the law is actually REGULATORY law
that should NOT be embedded in  the criminal law.
And what happens when the applicant cannot afford to buy the license?  Some
of the licenses offered in Bill C-68 will cost over $1000.  Is it fair or
reasonable that a person should be criminalized by poverty -- or
alternatively, denied the right to participate in a business, sport or
recreational activity by government avarice?
The more one looks at the regulatory nature of Bill C-68 -- as was so ably
described by then Minister of Justice Rock -- the more one is disturbed to
find it embedded within the criminal law, laced about with penalties of
multiple years of imprisonment, and defective in its principles.
For example, Bill C-68 makes it a criminal offence to be in possession of
any firearm.  Then it offers to sell a license commit that crime, to engage
in that criminal activity.  A Canadian buys the license, and engages in the
Five years later, the license expires.  If the person does not notice that
his license has expired, the expiry criminalizes the individual without his
knowledge.  The penalty is multiple years of imprisonment.
There have already been laws on the books that were struck down for that
defect.  The principles of our laws make it impossible to have a law that
imposes imprisonment for an offence where the accused did nothing wrong, but
merely did not notice that an expiring document was about to criminalize him
or her.
One hopes that those aspects of Bill C-68 will be brought out in future days
of the Alberta Court of Appeal hearing.

I've been lazily following the crypto-control issue through e$pam Somebody posted a question asking how many peoples would eventually be victims of crypto-enhanced crime.
Then, TM came to say that this is irrelevant.  TM was right in the context of the post, but it led me to ask myself this (vague) question:
To this, all I can find of enough magnitude to put them in such state is that they just recently *truly* realized that crypto will, infinitely more than to threaten the security of the state,
threaten their very existence by putting them outside of the money To paraphrase somebody, "individuals recognize taxation as damage and routes their e$ around"
I think that *this* debate should be injected in the population and the *bogus* "national security" debate should be dismissed as, just that : bogus.  *Everybody* not living on govt taxated money gets a sparkle in their eyes when I introduce them to crypto via the e-$ topic.  And all of the others gets pale...  ;-)
For most peoples, privacy in itself is worth something only if if they have some *value* they want to preserve.  Most of the time, this value concretizes itself as "money".  So if we talk to them in terms *they* understand, we run a much better chance to make them understand why spreading crypto is a tool we believe will greatly enhance human's life quality.
Any comments about why we should *not* put most emphasis on the financial aspect of crypto?

Sorry to say, but I don't completely get you idiosyncratic language.
My perception of it is that when you explain thoses things to productive individuals, i.e. individuals that get a lot of their money confiscated, most of them get quite interested while if you talk about the capability of talking dirty to your lover without your mother in law being able to know, they yawn faster than you can say Thus, IMO, brigning the discussion on the ground of taxation would be an attention getter.

AFAIK, e$pam is not edited and not a digest.  But there might be parental control ...  :-)
Tim, there are a lot of important issues in life, and crypto is only one of them.  I value your opinion a lot and find most of your comments to be not only valid but even often wise.  But of course, as a CP highness, you seems to sometimes forget :-) that:
1) CP is carrier to so much things that I don't find interesting
2) every second wasted never comes back
3) some of my other interests requires as much time as CP, mostly Canadian Firearms Digest where locally, we Canucks, are fighting a battle you are no stranger with, only we got it worse than you 4) IMO, crypto has to be a useful tool to be interesting.  I am more interested in improving life than in building aesthetic mathematical algorithms.  And the most direct way to achieve this is anonymous e-$, not guns.
5) fighting for privacy rights will be irrelevant when govt will have been starved to extinction by e-$.
6) If I subtract from my awake time my working time, my eating time, my washing time, my ****ing time and my domestic chores time, it leaves me with time I can do whatever I want.  This remaining time is always too short.
7) After several weeks of being on CP and e$pam and e$ simultaneously, I found that I can read most of you posts on CP via e$pam, great thanks to RAH.  RAH seems to forward everything that is even remotely related to e-$.  Unless RAH has a Machielavelous plan to induce everybody in error, for the time being, he does a great job.  I subscribe from times to times to CP for random durations at random moments just to cross-check theses things. My last year long absence from CP was caused by entirely other things.  I had no time for any net stuff at all. Why don't you try jf_avon at citenet.net? :-)  Get a decent mailer and you'll find it's easy...  :-)
So now, do you propose mandatory voluntary subscription to some mailing lists?  :-)  Never thought about telepathy? Or becoming a prominent TV figure so that *everybody* (well, almost...) would be force-fed to TM-Stuff (tm) ?   :-)  OK, OK, I push it a bit but why should I have to suffer the intelligent and down to the point discussions on CP if I consider that I have other better things to do?  The issue comes down to the respect of the Individual. Could I, pe-lease, have my own interests? Pe-lease?
As for your perception of "loosing time on folks [snip]", I opinate that it is an error from you.  Although I am off from CP, I recently ordered Applied Crypto (at last, I found the money...), and I plan to give a small introduction talk to various persons and groups.  I make *every* *damn* *efforts* to spread PGP with everybody I know, distributing software and keys.
But you see, if you say to somebody : this will encrypt your communications" they don't give a shit.  If you explain to them the digital telephony bill, the current tapping capability, the various moves that the govt is currently doing, *and* crypto through the e-$ applications *and* political consequences of e-$, *then* they *really* do get interested.  In my own experience, introducing the topic by the e-$/govt-intrusion door is what gets them the motivation to learn text-based plain-vanilla PGP.  And as I said in an earlier post, the more they get their money confiscated in the name of the Great Unwashed Happiness, the more they get interested.
So, "that folk" is one it is unwise to neglect, he just gets overwhelmed by the sheer volume of stuff on CP.  Most of the discouraged just unsubscribe and a few rare stick to it in diverse, indirect ways.  The ones who stick to it might just be the most persistent of them all.
I use Pegasus Mail V2.53 with a kill file verging on the terabyte thank you.  And I don't want to "participate", I want to exchange ideas.  Peoples who want to do so with me will do so.  If it is too much work to include me in your replies, just don't bother.
Please send me a valid name so I can keep posting to CP without suffering the irrelevant-to-my-interests stuff, in full confidence that RAH will keep doing it's fantastic job of forwarding your most-of-the-time-interesting-to-me posts.
Ciao Tim

Probably a sensible opinion.  But what would be the effect of pulling in the other direction?  Espcially if the population would be more personnally concerned with it?  The way it is now, National Security is a scarecrow but the real thing is the govt corn to be protected...
Only, to deploy any e-$ scheme would need an environment where govt would _tolerate_ crypto.  But the way it is going, everything is set in place to trample on anybody's face that will use crypto with the "not-the-flavour-of-the-month-at-White-House" sauce such as e-$ programmers, etc.  If the debate could be shifted-off, the legitimacy of the govt claimed goals could get strongly challenged.  This is possible only if there is a cause that concerns citizens directly.  Now, try telling me that taxation is the most popular of govt's measures...  The fact that a majority voted for Politician A does not mean that a majority loves him...
Precisely.  IMO, there is more hidden under there than meets the eye.  What if we try prying at this tiny, well concealed crack in the big wall?

AFAIK, e$pam is not edited and not a digest.  But there might be parental control ...  :-)
Tim, there are a lot of important issues in life, and crypto is only one of them.  I value your opinion a lot and find most of your comments to be not only valid but even often wise.  But of course, as a CP highness, you seems to sometimes forget :-) that:
1) CP is carrier to so much things that I don't find interesting
2) every second wasted never comes back
3) some of my other interests requires as much time as CP, mostly Canadian Firearms Digest where locally, we Canucks, are fighting a battle you are no stranger with, only we got it worse than you 4) IMO, crypto has to be a useful tool to be interesting.  I am more interested in improving life than in building aesthetic mathematical algorithms.  And the most direct way to achieve this is anonymous e-$, not guns.
5) fighting for privacy rights will be irrelevant when govt will have been starved to extinction by e-$.
6) If I subtract from my awake time my working time, my eating time, my washing time, my ****ing time and my domestic chores time, it leaves me with time I can do whatever I want.  This remaining time is always too short.
7) After several weeks of being on CP and e$pam and e$ simultaneously, I found that I can read most of you posts on CP via e$pam, great thanks to RAH.  RAH seems to forward everything that is even remotely related to e-$.  Unless RAH has a Machielavelous plan to induce everybody in error, for the time being, he does a great job.  I subscribe from times to times to CP for random durations at random moments just to cross-check theses things. My last year long absence from CP was caused by entirely other things.  I had no time for any net stuff at all. Why don't you try jf_avon at citenet.net? :-)  Get a decent mailer and you'll find it's easy...  :-)
So now, do you propose mandatory voluntary subscription to some mailing lists?  :-)  Never thought about telepathy? Or becoming a prominent TV figure so that *everybody* (well, almost...) would be force-fed to TM-Stuff (tm) ?   :-)  OK, OK, I push it a bit but why should I have to suffer the intelligent and down to the point discussions on CP if I consider that I have other better things to do?  The issue comes down to the respect of the Individual. Could I, pe-lease, have my own interests? Pe-lease?
As for your perception of "loosing time on folks [snip]", I opinate that it is an error from you.  Although I am off from CP, I recently ordered Applied Crypto (at last, I found the money...), and I plan to give a small introduction talk to various persons and groups.  I make *every* *damn* *efforts* to spread PGP with everybody I know, distributing software and keys.
But you see, if you say to somebody : this will encrypt your communications" they don't give a shit.  If you explain to them the digital telephony bill, the current tapping capability, the various moves that the govt is currently doing, *and* crypto through the e-$ applications *and* political consequences of e-$, *then* they *really* do get interested.  In my own experience, introducing the topic by the e-$/govt-intrusion door is what gets them the motivation to learn text-based plain-vanilla PGP.  And as I said in an earlier post, the more they get their money confiscated in the name of the Great Unwashed Happiness, the more they get interested.
So, "that folk" is one it is unwise to neglect, he just gets overwhelmed by the sheer volume of stuff on CP.  Most of the discouraged just unsubscribe and a few rare stick to it in diverse, indirect ways.  The ones who stick to it might just be the most persistent of them all.
I use Pegasus Mail V2.53 with a kill file verging on the terabyte thank you.  And I don't want to "participate", I want to exchange ideas.  Peoples who want to do so with me will do so.  If it is too much work to include me in your replies, just don't bother.
Please send me a valid name so I can keep posting to CP without suffering the irrelevant-to-my-interests stuff, in full confidence that RAH will keep doing it's fantastic job of forwarding your most-of-the-time-interesting-to-me posts.
Ciao Tim

FUD.  There is quite a difference between what Joe and Jane Average are and what the Lie-Box with 500 channels and most Lie-Leaflets will tell you.  Sorry for my idealism, but I still believe that there is a quantum of Reason in the population.  But you may be right here.  Duhhh, duhhhh, fucking duhhhh...
Why do you make me spend my resources (time, efforts) on having me defend myself on something I never said?  Just read my fucking text and this *is* what I said.  Go read Hettinga's rants on his web site about how e-$ will impose itself and why and consider that I agree with him on it.
[and here, I disregard the less-than-illuminated contradiction in And if you want to get emotionnal :-) , just as I also agreed and defended Jim Bell's opinion that AP was "not-possible-to-prevent-from-happening",  [unless they ban crypto, for legitimate e-$ scheme need authorities's tolerance of crypto] and backed my opinion with rational arguments. Thank you very much. Just like anybody describing and saying that the Ebola virus is mortal doesn't mean one loves to kill...  So, DUHHHH squared.

Let's get into modelization! So, let's put first things first.
First, you shouldn't say e$ but $, because it is what thoses you call "the rich" have.
Now, does e-$ would permit govt to behave the same way as they do now?
How do they win?  By the use of coercion (and this is why guns should not get registered).
Out of what hat did you got that one? Who said so and why?  :-)  My opinion is that your remark is falling into the same category as the the old fallacy saying "everything is uncertain but death and taxes". Statistically, yes.  But it doesn't intrinsically generates *envious* poors.  But that is a discussion about Values and Ethics and their link to emotions and nobody who's not an Ayn Rand fanatic or who doesn't have a few more terabytes of disk space to spare doesn't want to get into it...  :-)
It depends on which moral code the legislative authorities base their actions.  But the sentence "a large group of poor will always try, within a democracy, to justify the muscling-in on the rich transactually-acquired wealth" would be true.
This one for-the-time-being reason why crypto should be deployed.
The true answers will be found in the nature of the data exchange system, it's robustness and reliability, and the impact of dropping the govt out of the money loop.  Sometimes, an invention can change the face of the world.  Mathematics did, gun powder did, the printing press did, the microprocessor did, so why not crypto?  And what is the most Joe Everybody consumer-oriented use of crypto?
P.S. Anybody who has a clue about modelizing the effects  of a behaviour/entity (use of e$) that hamper the survival of another one (govt) in a complex system, please drop me a line (any micro-biologists online?)

Your last sentence means that they can read crypted text.  They even hinted at it recently.  But then, why the proposed law?
Do they indulge in statistical efficiency or do they want 99.9999+% efficiency at their "filtering"?  I'd say if they "filter" only, say, 90% of all communications and an Oklahoma City plan passes by in the 10% remaining, it won't be good enough for them.  So, why the law if they already can decrypt?  Can you reasonnably expect the vilains to use the most easy-to-crack and/or GAKed schemes? If you were in their shoes, what would you say to the public?  Ever heard about the game called Poker?  Did Santa told you they would never lie to you?
In the last few weeks, I've been thinking about the utility and security risk of using PGP if it can be cracked easily.
And then, I realized that my reaction was probably just what they expected: FUD to have people limit by themselves their use of strong crypto.  Coupled with the cops saying that "of course, we can decode them, but just a tad too slow to protect your childs...", I now believe they just can't crack it.
And with it, comes their crackdown on crypto users, their e-$ and their crypted love letters.

It is not everybody who say that their only wish is to get our keys for the sake of reading our love letters... [see later remark]
Since when the tax man was a middleman?
Basically, the law of causality starts to catch them up.  Money is an expression of Man's Reason, expressed through it's productive abilities. Since taxing is always coercitive, it goes against individuals's best judgment.  So, when there is nothing to physically coerce, they loose the ability to tax.
"Economic Potential", Newspeak for "confiscation of production to finance other's peoples dreams".  And they realize that if they don't clamp on it *now*, it'll go through their fingers like fine dry sand.  "To explore the [...] issues": Newspeak for "to bully the Freedom-of-e-commerce groups", Newspeak for "to figure out a way to keep milking them without killing them".  How in the hell tax policies will "protect" the electronic commerce?  Easy: just the way the Mafia used to "protect" commerces from burning Newspeak Master.
Newspeak for "how to keep milking, or rather, keep bloodsucking them without killing them?
And accessorily,   how exactly does it work?  In a totally non-private way.  So, *naturally*,  businesspersons will want to protect their privacy.  But how in hell is the govt be able to do *any* monitoring of transactions if the transactions are encrypted?  Duhhh...
Note to Unicorn: how does 2+2 ?    :-)
Peoples on Death Row are more lucky:: they don't get coaxed to weave their own hanging rope...
Why concede them their screwed-up, leech mentality basic premises? In no way should we engage in this discussion.  All we need to do is to expose our basic premises and say that the case rest.
I.e. there is only one way to make us swallow their Newspeak: to dazzle us with their fancy and rhetorics in order
 to make us abandon our basic premises.
But will we?   :-b                  --8==

I posted several off-topic messages to the CFD, to introduce theses peoples to encryption, digital signatures, e$, etc.  For thoses who are curious about firearms related politics in Kanada, this it *the* forum for it.  Take note that the Allan Rock discussed in the various posts is the former Canada Justice Minister, now Canada Health Minister, who fanatically drafted and frantically pushed bill C-68, the gun registration bill.  Just so you know, now, in Kanada, simple possession of *any* firearms or some other weapons *is* a crime passible of 14 year of imprisonement, *unless* you get a permit that, in effect, waive that crime.  Of course, they say that they make it simple and reasonable to get it, but what the authorities want is to disamr the population.  Recently, they did not even shy out at saying it explicitely.  Among their plans, the outright confiscation without compensation of a great number of now Verboten types of firearms.

They require all citizens to obtain a driver's licence containing a social security number. The law makes mention of ï¿½biometric identifiers ï¿½by which is meant such high-tech delights as digitized thumb or fingerprints on magnetic strips. An unrelated, for the moment, announcement by the Immigration Service on June 23 revealed a new identification system called INSPASS. The latter is a system which verifies such things as retinal and hand scans in order to let frequent travelers pass through customs more quickly. All very efficient.   In this land of the free, whose praises are sung ad nauseam, these kinds of regulations are being introduced frequently and surreptitiously so that the average man, or woman, in the street will not realize what is happening until it is far too late to protest. Requirements such as social security numbers on driving licences are leading inevitably towards their becoming national identity cards. A card which the citizen will soon need to secure government services, apply for a job, conduct banking transactions or even to buy something as simple as an airline ticket.     An old topic with a new twist Of course this topic is not new to the US, various groups have been proposing tamper-proof ID cards for many years. Often this was connected to discussions on gun control or immigration, it being believed that illegal immigration could be deterred by the use of such cards. The fact that they would be no more reliable than the documents produced originally to obtain them, plus the estimated $2.5 billions required to implement them, does not deter those who would mandate their use. A great deal of the impetus for ID cards is coming from California where a serious illegal immigration problem does indeed exist. As usual, politicians possessed of little or no imagination propose simplistic solutions to complex social and economic problems. Their idea being that such a card would become a kind of employment passport, which illegal immigrants would not possess. Unless, that is, their friendly local forger could supply one. There can be little doubt that the appearance of such a card would be welcomed by the police, they could then stop people at will and ask for some identification. The potential for the harassment of strange, different looking or foreign sounding individuals will increase exponentially. Minorities such as Asians, Latinos and African Americans will become even more perfect targets for such identity checks. Other groups too, such as banks, health insurers, landlords, merchants and others, salivate at the prospect of employing ID cards in their daily activities. Information, once gathered, can be stored at almost no cost, and retrieved in any imaginable sequence. It is this which is providing the incentive to collect the sort of information that has hitherto been maintained about only a very small portion of the population. The United States already has in its education system a national electronic network of student records. The purpose of this system being to allow the exchange of information between various public and private agencies, and the tracking of individuals through school and university, through their military service, through the criminal justice system, through their civilian careers, and through their use of the medical services. Toward a womb to tomb database At the moment, these databases are provided only with an electronic portfolio for every student, an assessment of each student's work and behavior by his teacher and the student's social security number. It is proposed also to include: data about prenatal care; birth weight; number of years in a pre-school program; poverty status; physical, emotional and other development at various ages; date of last routine health and dental care; plus many other items such as the employer's name and whether the person is registered to vote. A womb to tomb, all seeing, all knowing database. In a book published jointly by the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is ominous talk of ï¿½overcoming the confidentiality barrier. ï¿½The purpose of the new databases being stated as giving all agencies ï¿½ready access to each other's data. ï¿½ There is a group in the US known as the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) which is actively involved with the Transportation Secretary in proposing or actually changing the various state driving licences to include digitally encoded fingerprints, retinal scans, digital computer readable photographs and other biometric forms of identification. So far, some 28 States have actually begun to make or proposed the changes to their driver's licences. Last December, the AAMVA announced that fingerprints are their currently favored form of biometric identification. It may interest readers to learn that many Canadian provinces are also members of the AAMVA. It would be naive to think that these ideas will not cross the world's longest undefended border before long. All the State assemblies which have introduced the necessary legislation to implement this new form of national ID have done so under cover, usually at the end of a legislative session in the middle of the night. These politicians know a thing or two about journalists. The mainstream media having been remarkably silent on the subject and frequently supportive of the federal government. On a positive note, at least a few States are now actively involved in trying to repeal the fingerprinting requirement. Alabama and New Jersey have done it, and Georgia is considering a piece of draft legislation which will forbid the use of biometric identifiers of any kind. ï¿½Live Free or Die ï¿½the motto of our neighboring US State of New Hampshire, may well become somewhat more than a motto if its citizens do not resist these latest proposals emanating from their Federal Government. Perhaps, instead of providing their fingerprints, they should show their politicians a collective upraised finger.   sommaire    page suivante  <980801-7.htm> <980801-7.htm>

Not to bug you personnally, just a comment on the general state of affairs:
IMHO, there is no such thing as "legitimate needs of law enforcement" that
could justify such a limitation of the freedom of the individuals who had
nothing wrong.
"legitimate" in our present context means to "counter things that are
presently illegal", notwithstanding that an immense portion of the
which in essence does not try to get a free ride from some sort of law, do
agree at all with the said law.
Somehow, I think that it is time to emphasize our taking of the moral high

@_subject: BEWARE of SnakeOil (tm) 
SNAKEOIL ALERT:
Maybe his product is valid, but, after having read the the Cypherpunks mailing list for years, here are my conclusions:
- beware of any product that has not been *extensively* peer-reviewed, with *all* the source code made public.  Security breaches are *very* easy to overlook and no software should *ever* be used unless it was peer-reviewed.
- the fact that a software uses a specific encryption technique that is described in well known books and that this technique is usually recognized as secure by the cryptanalysis community doesn't mean that the *specific* software implementation of it is truly secure.  Thus, the need not only to peer-review the specific encryption technique but *also* and *especially* the precise coding implementation. [from their web page] "CryptView will allow you to validate algorithms and examine the internals of SecureOffice files. You can see the inside of the cryptography box. CryptView allows you to examine file formats and come to your own conclusions about the Security of SecureOffice. "
- the fact an encrypted output doesn't look comprehensible to *you* or to a software engineer doesn't mean that a cryptanalyst cannot crack it within minutes...  It is a *very* complicated science indeed.  If you are not a PhD in cryptanalysis with years of experience in software security, you can't know.  One of the NSA top cryptanalyst once said that before you spent at least fifteen years of your life cracking codes, you have no idea of how to devise a truly secure one.
They try pursue anybody who violates ITAR in a public way.  If I were to walk with a PGP diskette across the border outside Cana-USA, I would be liable under ITAR even if I never wrote a line of software in my life.
Yes, in USA, and it applies to Canada too, encryption software is considered the same as missiles for export purposes (category: ammunition).  It is regulated by ITAR, just like guns.  But this text borders on being glib.
PGP caused a lot of trouble to his author too, but PGP has been *very extensively* peer reviewed.  At least, AFAIK, V2.6.2.  The newer version of PGP uses *several* encryption techniques, among which you have to choose.
Absolute BS!  The security is afforded by the specific cryptography mathematics that are themselves *extensively* well known, peer reviewed and, in the case of 3DES (DES), *invented* in government labs!  The other technique, RSA, is used in PGP and the patent will expire in a few years.
Un-peer-reviewed code has an excedingly high probability of being snakeoil, especially if it is marketed before being reviewed...
A false feeling of security is much more dangerous than no security at all.
All the govts have vested interest in disseminating pseudo-strong cryptography.  This statement is not paranoia, it is recent and regularly recurring history.
I find the information in the web page way too incomplete and, to the limit, misleading. Personnally, I prefer to stick to PGP.  Version 5.x is *easy* to use.
I do get tired of seeing posts like that around...
One of theses days, I will write a FAQ on encryption for the layman...
If ever I find that this software is appropriate, I will say so on the CFD.
I do not own any interests, direct or indirect, in PGP.
Security is not afforded by a few tools, it is a state of mind.

globe. I would like to acknowledge our friends from the U.K, South Africa, Brazil, New
Zealand, Australia and the good old U.S.A. I have just sent out idividual
messages to all of these countries and some others including Germany, Belgium, Austria, Boliva,
Argentina, Aruba Slovakia and Barbados.  If your country has not been listed please
contact me directly. I am trying to develop a list of countries that are logging onto our open
firearms chat line. It is my goal to have firearm owners from every country monitoring and
sharing their experiences.
Please encourage fellow shooters in your country to come on line and
take advantage of this open forum. I fully realize that the primary focus of the Canadian
Firearms Chat Line is aimed at Canadian gun laws; however, there is a great deal of
pertinent international information that could be shared in this medium and we will all be the
beneficiaries if we willfully share our ideas and experiences.
I have another strategy up my sleeve regarding rallying the
international firearm community prior to the final outcome of the United Nations firearms
workshops in the year 2000; therefore it is paramount that we maintain frequent global
communications. I will be exploring some of my ideas with the NRA and the Sporting
Shooters Association of Australia in the new year and floating some draft strategies for open
discussion. Moreover, I fully intend on attending most of the United Nations firearm
workshops therefore having everyone connected to one open forum would assist
me in getting this information out all of you in a quick concise manner.
I've had a few myopic individuals ask me why I should be so concerned
about gun control in other countries ?  As far as I am concerned we should all be
concerned -VERY concerned ! When one of our sister countries falls we should all feel
their pain and learn something valuable, because we may be next. We cannot for a minute
forget about the draconian laws rammed down the throats of other Commonwealth countries
in particular or any free-thinking society. Can we really delude ourselves into
thinking that it couldn't happen here- don t kid yourself, as I write, the erosion of our rights
is going down the same path as Australians are treading, faster than we care to admit, and
we all should instinctively know it?  How would Canadians like to have all of their
semis and pump shotguns and rifles declared illegal and confiscated overnight by a
communist-leaning, bleeding heart liberal government- think about it !!
It is important for Canadians to realize that countries all over the
world feel no different that we do. They feel just as vulnerable and thus are seeking guidance
and support. We are in an excellent position to offer assistance to each other via this open
forum. I truly believe we can learn from each others  mistakes and triumphs. Perhaps if we can
tap into this universal intelligence on a continuous basis we could overtake the
mighty Goliath.
If time permits I would like to post the names of all anti-firearm NGO's
and their meetings which are going on simultaneously all over the world as we speak. I
think it is high time that we banded together as one solid global unit in an effort to
effectively launch a counter attack against those that take glee in the gradual
erosion of our civil rights and liberties.
A frequent complaint about this type of forum is the problem of
receiving an excessive number of messages, but I believe the rewards associated with this
hassle far out weigh the inconvenience. I care very much that our friends in South Africa are now
subject to new guns laws. I am sickened by what has transpired in Australia and the
U.K. I want the world to know how crime has escalated in Brazil and yet they live under
the most stringent gun control laws. As a point of interest the " boys from
Brazil " will be preparing a written paper outlining this very fact which I will present on their
behalf to the anti-gun Brazilian delegation at the next U.N workshop in Vienna in the latter
part of Jan/99.
In conclusion, if you are interested in banding together as one strong
universal voice, then get your friends connected to this open chat /and or digest.  Let us not
lose focus of our own battle at home, but let us not turn a blind eye to our global
neighbours  struggles.
I understand that English is a problem for some of you, but we are
understanding and we willing to work through any language barriers. So please do NOT feel
uncomfortable to communicate with us - we d love to hear what has transpired in your
country !
Remember, repeated blows to the lower extremities will eventually cause
the giant to fall !

LOCAL  Saturday 12 December 1998 'Martial law' rushed for Y2K chaos Report warns government to be ready to invoke federal Emergencies Act
 By David Pugliese           The Ottawa Citizen
  The federal government should consider invoking the Emergencies Act, the successor to the War Measures Act, if the millennium bug causes widespread chaos, according to newly obtained government documents.  The report, by the Year 2000 contingency planning group of Emergency Preparedness Canada, calls for orders and regulations for the Emergencies Act to be ready by the end of March.  "In the worst case, we should consider the Emergencies Act a potential source of special powers," urge documents prepared by government in July and August and obtained by the Citizen under the Access to Information Act.  "Among the activities that must be done to meet the problems resulting from Y2000 failures is development of relevant emergency orders and regulations required for the invocation of emergency provisions under the Emergencies Act."  Federal departments are to identify what emergency orders would be needed in their areas of responsibility to deal with a countrywide disaster caused by the millennium bug. Those orders and regulations should have been in place in 1988 -- when the Emergencies Act was brought in to replace the War Measures Act -- but federal departments failed to develop them. While the lack of emergency orders and regulations among federal departments would not have prevented the Emergencies Act from being invoked, it would have meant that any federal response to a large-scale crisis would not have run smoothly.  Defence Minister Art Eggleton, who is in charge of Emergency Preparedness Canada, will also be issued with a step-by-step guidebook on actions to be taken in a "major or catastrophic emergency" caused by the millennium bug, according to the report.  That book will include all the documents needed and the names of provincial officials who should be consulted before the federal government invokes the Emergencies Act.  The War Measures Act was last invoked by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on Oct. 16, 1970, to deal with the FLQ terrorist threat -- the first and only peacetime implementation of such sweeping powers.  The Front de Liberation du Quebec had kidnapped British diplomat James Cross, who was later released, and Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Laporte, who was slain. During the crisis, Canadian troops were ordered to protect public figures, and 497 possible suspects were arbitrarily rounded up and arrested in an attempt to break the FLQ cell structure.  Defence spokesman Maj. John Blakeley said the process now being put in place is simply part of prudent planning to deal with the millennium bug and does not automatically mean the Emergencies Act will be enacted.  "The question of whether it will be required or not is one that will have to be determined at the time," Maj. Blakeley said. "Basically, this is saying, 'If it gets to that stage, is everything ready?' "  Maj. Blakeley said all scenarios have to be considered, including the most unlikely one: widespread major problems caused by the millennium bug. He added that the Defence department is confident it will be ready to handle any emergencies associated with the computer glitch.  But the Auditor General has continually warned that the federal government is lacking in its emergency response capabilities. Among the criticisms over the years:  - In 1997, the Auditor General voiced concern that not enough was being done to deal with an emergency caused by a major oil or chemical spill;  - In 1992, the Auditor General repeated warnings that the government had still not created an emergency program to deal with an earthquake. The Auditor General's office says those plans are still undeveloped.  - In 1989, the Auditor General pointed out that the emergency orders and measures needed by federal departments for the Emergencies Act had not been mapped out. Nine years later, that remains the case.  Jim Hanson, a defence analyst and retired Canadian Army brigadier general, said the Emergencies Act contains the same sweeping powers to deal with unrest and civil emergencies. But he said it is likely such measures are intended more to give powers to civilian agencies, such as police forces, in case there are problems from the millennium bug.  "It wouldn't take much under the existing National Defence Act or the 'aid to civil powers' provisions to put military personnel on the streets."  Some computer analysts believe the millennium bug, also known as the Year 2000 or Y2K problem, will cause only minor disruptions. But others predict it will trigger widespread disruptions in computers that control everything from hydro and financial systems to air-traffic control.  The problem centres on the fact that the internal counters of computers will read the year 2000 simply as 00. That could cause them to crash as they misread the 00 for the year 1900.  Several months ago the Canadian Forces were told to prepare for the biggest peacetime deployment of troops ever in case computer failures caused by the Year 2000 problem disrupted key services. The plan, dubbed Operation Abacus, also involves the development of rules governing the use of force by soldiers in case they are called upon to assist police in dealing with emergency incidents.  The reports obtained by the Citizen predict the first wave of computer failures could hit Canada on Sept. 9, 1999, because systems might have problems handling that date sequence, which is 9-9-99. The Defence department will activate a national co-ordination centre to handle emergency response to the millennium bug the day before that date, according to the documents.  As part of its preparations, the national co-ordination centre will also run several exercises to test military readiness. In April, federal and provincial agencies in Quebec and Ontario will conduct a three-day training scenario involving a nuclear emergency -- a major test and evaluation of how the federal government and provinces can respond to a large-scale emergency that might result from the millennium bug, according to the Access documents.  In the reports, military officials also raise concern that their ability to help out if the millennium bug causes widespread problems relies heavily on Canada's electrical, transportation, food and water and sewage systems having their own Year 2000 problems under control: "The ability of the (Canadian Forces) to provide civil assistance is highly dependent on the state of preparedness of these infrastructure items since the CF, like everyone else, is highly dependent on smooth delivery of these supplies and services," the documents state. "Without aggressive action in these industrial and service sectors, the (Canadian Forces) may not be able to make a significant impact across the nation as a force of last resort."  Military officials point out that more than 16,000 troops were needed to deal with the effects of the ice storm that hit Ontario and Quebec this year. But the millennium bug, the report states, "has the potential of creating a demand orders of magnitude greater than this, which are well beyond the CF's capability to respond."  Defence officials called for "aggressive and preventive actions" now to reduce the Year 2000 risk to a more manageable level.  The military will have about 32,000 of its personnel dedicated to Operation Abacus, with thousands more available if needed.  In November, the Commons Public Accounts committee questioned whether the Canadian Forces would be able to deal with countrywide problems that might be caused by the millennium bug.  But several weeks later, a report by Auditor General Denis Desautels found that the critical systems the Defence department needs should computer foul-ups create civil chaos are largely ready. These included systems that support the movement of troops and supplies and handling of communications.

"The Edmonton Examiner" a local community newspaper, ran an
editorial entitled "Gun lobby has a point."  In it they
accused the "pro-gun" faction of posturing and paranoia, but
then went on to say the so called "lobby" is correct in it's
assessment of the registry.  The paper  said, "the
government has failed to show how gun registration will
reduce crime, which is the sole reason for registration."  rifles deter crimes, while "the new law does nothing to
deter the easy access to guns smuggled in from the U.S." Another statement follows, "and of course the criminal
element has no interest in registering guns."  The editor
makes one last telling remark, "So exactly what is the
point? Essentially, it is to gather information.  All
governments love information, the more the better.  But
there is no proof at all that registering guns deters
criminal activity."
follows indicates the writer likes to do a little
investigative journalism.... The editor then conducted a
telephone poll asking the question "ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF THE
GOVERNMENTS GUN REGISTRY PROGRAM?  (Remember folks, the
constituents of "Idle Annie" had their say in this poll.) The results were 76%  AGAINST the registration program with
24% in favour..... Oh dear, Annie..... You'd better hope
they change their minds come election time......  owned a gun, but I resent this program which smacks of a
police state."  Another said, "I have yet to undertstand how
having the gun registered that killed those students in
Montreal registered would have prevented that terrible
deed." The last and most telling,  "It is simply a way to
enable the confiscation of firearms in order to prevent any
insurrection or revolt against a government that may be
imposing oppressive measures."
the "only one life" bleat came from the 24% who actually
liked the registry.  One even said "Gun owners have to wait
hours to get their guns, instead of minutes.  Get over it
you big whiny crybabies."  (Kinda makes you question the
maturity of that one!)
because we are educating the public.  The more they know
about the registration process and the costs, the less they
like the idea.  We have accomplished this without breaking
any laws, and without the need to indulge in civil
disobedience.  If we break (even unjust) laws and engage in
publicised acts of civil disobedience then we will lose. The newsmedia will then (rightly) portray us as a bunch of
right wing fanatics, and elements of the lunatic fringe. The NFA has proved we can be heard, and that the public is
seeing things our way without the need to engage in silly
demonstrations.  Let's see how far we can go within the law,
during the next four years.

Simon says:  "Well what about it Annie?  What do your spin

==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
Did you intend to upgrade to Win98?
If you do, here's a preview of the READ ME FIRST page
Congratulations on your purchase of Windows 98 (c),
the latest version of the world's  computer operating
system from Microsoft.
A) Before using your new software, please take the time to read these
instructions carefully. Failure to do so may further limit the terms of the
limited warranty. Windows 98 (c) represents a significant
technological improvement over Microsoft's previous operating
system, Windows 95 (c).
You'll notice immediately that
  * "98" is a higher number than "95,"
  * a better than 3 percent increase.
But that's not all. Windows 98 (c) contains many features not found in
Windows 95 (c), or in any competing computer operating system, (if
there are any of course).
Among the improvements: faster storing and
retrieving of files (not in all models), enhanced "Caps Lock" and
back-space functionality, smoother handling, less knocking and
pinging, an easy-to-follow 720-page User's Guide, and rugged
weather-resistant shrink wrap around the box. Most important,
Windows 98 (c) offers superior compatibility with all existing
Microsoft products. We're betting that you'll never use another
company's software again.
Windows 98 (c) comes factory-loaded with the latest version of
Microsoft Explorer, the world's most popular Internet browser. And
despite what you may have heard from the U.S. Department of
Justice, Windows 98 (c) offers you the freedom to select the
Internet browser of your choice, whether it's the one produced by
the world's largest and most trusted software producer, or by a
smaller company that will either go out of business or become part
of the Microsoft family.
Configuring Windows 98 (c) to use a browser OTHER than Microsoft
Explorer is easy. Simply open the "Options" folder, click on the
"time bomb" icon, and select "Load Inferior Browser." A dialog box
will ask "Are you sure?" Click "yes." This question may be asked
several more times in different ways and in 12 different languages
; just keep clicking "yes." Eventually, the time-bomb icon will
enlarge to fill the entire screen, signifying that the browser is
being loaded. You'll know the browser is fully loaded when the fuse
on the time bomb "runs out" and the screen "explodes." If at any
time after installation you become disappointed with the slow speed
and frequent data loss associated with other browsers, simply tap
the space bar on your keyboard. Microsoft Explorer will automatically be
re-installed- permanently.
Windows 98 (c) also corrects, for the first time anywhere, the "Year
2000" computer problem. As you may know, most computers store
the current year as a two-digit number and, as a result, many will
mistake the year 2000 for 1900. Windows 98 (c) solves the
problem by storing the year as a four-digit number and, in theory,
you won't have to upgrade this part of the operating system until the
year 10000.
However, the extra memory required to record the year in four digits
has prompted a few minor changes in the software's internal
calendar. Henceforth, Saturday and Sunday will be stored as single
day, known as "Satsun," and the month of June will be replaced by
two 15-day months called "Bill" and "Melissa." Please also take the
time to complete the online registration form. It only takes a few
minutes and will help us identify the key software problems our
customers want addressed. Be assured that none of the
information you provide, whether it's your Social Security number,
bank records, fingerprints, retina scan or sexual history, will be
shared with any outside company not already designated as a
Microsoft DataShare partner.
We've done our best to make using Windows 98 (c) as trouble-free
as possible. We want to hear from you if you're having any
problems at all with you software. Simply call our toll-free Helpline
and follow the recorded instructions carefully. (The Helpline is open every
day but Satsun, and is closed for the entire month of Bill.)
If we don't hear from you, we'll assume your software is working
perfectly, and an electronic message to that effect will be forwarded
to the Justice Department. We'll also send, in your name, a letter to
the editor of your hometown newspaper, reminding him or her that
American consumers want software designed by companies that
are free to innovate, not by government bureaucrats.
Again, thanks for choosing Windows 98 (c).

White Paper
The Export of Certain Networking Encryption Products under ELAs As An Alternative to
"Key Escrow/Recovery Products" under KMI: A Networking Industry White Paper on
Encryption Export Controls

Roszel C. Thomsen II, Thomsen & Burke LLP
     Encryption Press Release

Executive Summary
The Clinton Administration's export control policy is designed to promote development of cryptographic products that provide law enforcement agencies with
access to encrypted data. Products that implement key escrow/recovery to provide such access are broadly exportable under License Exception KMI.
Although some customers have indicated interest in products that implement key escrow/recovery for stored data, customers generally oppose mandatory key
escrow/recovery for data in transit. This White Paper proposes that certain networking encryption products that provide for authorized access without key
recovery should also be eligible for broad export under appropriate Encryption Licensing Arrangements.
The Administration's export control policy must also reflect the equities of the intelligence community. Therefore, the proposed Encryption Licensing
Arrangements should be approved subject to riders and conditions designed to prevent the export of strong encryption products to military end-users, for
military end-uses, or to any government ministry, agency or department of certain countries.
The operational characteristics of networking encryption products to be eligible for export under appropriate Encryption Licensing Arrangements are not
complex. Simply stated, the operator action model delivers a 'private door-bell,' not a 'house-key' to parties lawfully seeking access to data. Qualifying
products must incorporate an operator-controlled management interface that enables dynamic, real-time access to specified network traffic prior to
encryption, or after decryption, at a designated access point.
In Executive Order 13026 of November 15, 1996, President Clinton said that cryptographic products implementing the Key Management Infrastructure
("KMI") would be eligible for export without licenses after a one-time technical review.1 On December 30, 1996, the Commerce Department's Bureau of
Export Administration ("BXA") published an interim rule amending the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR", 15 CFR Part 730 et seq.) that implements
Executive Order 13026.2
The better-known provision of this interim rule states that "key escrow or key recovery products" are exportable under License Exception KMI. The term
"key escrow or key recovery products" is defined in great detail in Section 740.8(d)(1)(i) and Supplement No. 4 to Part 742 of the EAR.
A lesser-known provision of this interim rule states that "other recoverable encryption products" shall receive "favorable consideration" for export. The term
"other recoverable encryption items" is defined briefly in Section 740.8(d)(1)(ii) of the EAR, and the type of "favorable consideration" that should be accorded
to such products is not defined at all. The ambiguity of this provision provides an opportunity to explore new approaches to exporting cryptographic products.
Industry has studied the technical, market and policy issues surrounding the KMI. These studies suggest that there may be market demand for products
implementing key escrow/recovery techniques for retrieval of encrypted stored data. Such products would also appear to meet law enforcement's
requirements for retrieval of encrypted stored data. However, no market demand exists for products implementing key escrow/recovery techniques for
retrieval of encrypted transient data. Eminent cryptographers have argued that key escrow/recovery techniques create unnecessary risks for encrypted
transient data.3 The National Security Agency ("NSA") has confirmed these findings.4
The networking industry proposes that certain networking encryption products described in this White Paper may receive wide market acceptance and meet
the requirements of law enforcement with respect to transient data without implementing key recovery. The intelligence community's equities, though not
reflected in the EAR, must be respected as well.
Analysis of Market Requirements
In order to meet market requirements, networking encryption products must: (1) provide strong security, (2) adhere to open standards, and (3) support an
operator-controlled management mechanism to specify encrypted flows.
Strong security is essential for products that encrypt transient data. Customers, particularly service providers, have stated repeatedly and emphatically that they
will not purchase products that encrypt transient data, if those products also facilitate unauthorized, covert surveillance by third parties. The government should
encourage the deployment of products that implement strong security, because such products will deter certain kinds of crimes, like theft of trade secrets by
third parties.
Deployment of products that encrypt transient data requires open standards. Without open standards, different vendors' products will not inter-operate, and
broad deployment will not be possible. The government should encourage the deployment of standards-compliant products, because it has a shared interest in
a common cross-vendor solution and the rapid deployment of strong new viable technologies.
Some customers also have indicated that operator-control of encryption flows is a useful feature for network diagnostics and reporting, and for allowing the
efficient transmission of non-sensitive data. Customers in regulated industries, such as banking and securities, also may need to monitor their employees'
communications from time-to-time. Most customers also desire the ability to respond to a court order without exposing all of their data across the Internet or
the public switched telephone network.
Analysis of Government Requirements
The EAR describes key escrow/recovery products primarily in terms of their utility to law enforcement. The government's interests, however, are not
monolithic. The law enforcement and intelligence communities have different requirements.
Law enforcement's main priority has been to establish procedures for access to encrypted data in transit that are comparable to existing procedures for voice
communications and therefore capable of introduction into evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction. The technical characteristics of the networking
encryption products described in this White Paper will be of greatest interest to law enforcement, because these technical characteristics are the key to
meeting law enforcement's requirements for access to plaintext.
The intelligence community, on the other hand, has not shown much confidence that key escrow/recovery will meet its requirements since the secret Skipjack
algorithm and governmental escrow agents featured in the original Clipper Chip were abandoned in favor of vendor-selected algorithms and commercial
escrow agents. Its primary concern currently appears to be the broad deployment of encryption technology that does not interfere with current best
operational practices. In this regard, the technical characteristics of qualifying products may be of secondary importance to the intelligence community, and
proposed riders and conditions on the ELA may be of greater importance. An Alternative to Key Escrow/Recovery for Networking Products
Although key escrow/recovery is not acceptable for data in transit, some customers require a mechanism that can reveal real-time plaintext for network
diagnostics and reporting, the transmission of non-sensitive data, occasional employee monitoring, and to support law enforcement. The proposed alternative
to key escrow/recovery does not require weakened cryptography, yet provides access similar to that currently available for voice communications.
Packet switched data networks handle traffic differently than circuit-switched voice networks. Circuit switched voice networks are characterized by the
opening of a dedicated circuit where communications are transferred in "real time." Packet switched networks are a statistically-multiplexed environment where
communications are routed packet-by-packet, so that data is fragmented but delivered in near real time. In spite of these differences, packet switched data
networks can, with some limitations, enable real-time access to plaintext. The proposed alternative to key recovery provides customers with full-strength
encryption, while simultaneously enabling the dynamic creation of an access point that allows real-time interception of plaintext based upon the target's source
or destination, whether the product is located within an enterprise or at a service provider's premises.
Two Access Scenarios: Access in the Enterprise, and Access at a Service Provider's Premises
The access point concept is not a perfect solution for all products. For example, it does not easily apply to user-to-user desktop applications. However, it
does appear to offer a reasonable alternative to key recovery on many classes of network applications and platforms. Specifically, it is a viable approach to
access to plaintext for devices where the individual responsible for data creation/reception is not the same individual responsible for platform operation. Such
devices constitute a significant percentage of the available networked platforms, including firewalls, routers, switches and other networking devices.

Meeting Law Enforcement Requirements
In order to be exportable under the proposed Encryption Licensing Arrangements, networking encryption products must contain a management interface that
dynamically controls encryption by source and destination address, and by network protocol, to enable real-time access to selected network traffic prior to
encryption or after decryption. The operational characteristics of these products may be summarized below:
     a) A qualifying network encryption product must incorporate an encryption management interface that:
     i) is remotely accessible;
     ii) controls the encryption configuration of the platform;
     iii) configures encryption policy by source and destination network address;
     iv) enables a remote operator to modify the encryption configuration dynamically;
     v) enables the interception of network traffic between a specific source and destination either prior to encryption or after decryption at a defined access
     point;
     b) A qualifying network encryption product may:
     i) be hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software;
     ii) encrypt any network protocol and/or at any network layer;
     iii) support any
          a) encryption algorithm
          b) key length
          c) key generation mechanism
          d) key management scheme;
     iv) be standalone, or integrated with other functions;
     v) be a single user, multi-user or infrastructure platform;
     vi) enable interception on the wire, on media (such as a hard disk), via a specialized communications port, or at another defined access point.
Two figures that illustrate how qualifying products may provide access to plaintext are set forth in Figures 1 and 2 of this paper.
Meeting Intelligence Community's Requirements
Current best operational practices are not widely understood by the public, and they may be compromised by the broad deployment of networking encryption
products, whether of US or of foreign manufacture. However, the possible loss of access to plaintext communications due to use of commercial cryptography
must be analyzed within the broader framework of advances in new technologies. As one eminent cryptographer testified before the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, "Advances in emitter identification, network penetration techniques, and the implementation of cryptanalytic or
crypto-diagnostic operations within intercept equipment are likely to provide more new sources of intelligence than are lost as a result of commercial use of
In further recognition of and deference to the intelligence community's equities, industry is not requesting authorization to export products with key lengths
exceeding 56 bits to military end-users or for military end-uses, or to any government ministry, agency or department of the countries listed in "Tier 3" (as
defined for purposes of computer export controls). Exports of products exceeding 56 bits to these end-users would require a separate license issued by BXA
after full inter-agency review under applicable Executive Orders. The differences between the proposed ELA and export under License Exception KMI are
summarized in the chart below:

Hi Cypherpunks.
I fell on that text in the Canadian Firearms Digest, V2  today.
Maybe somebody will want to look into it to see what part of ITAR was modified and if it will affect crypto...
Please feel free to forward to every possibly interested party.
(  indicates that US State Dept. expects
the current exemption of Canada from the ITAR export permit
requirements for firearms and ammunition (and parts thereof)
to be rescinded soon.
When I spoke to a US State Department employee, they indicated they
were being told it is going to happen in a few days.
They gave me a Canadian government employee counterpart contact
information (?Dept of Foreign Affairs?).
I spoke with the Canadian government contact, and was pleasantly
surprised for a change.
I was told that Canada plans to contest this threatened action, since
in part it could have wider trade implications outside the firearms
and ammunition realm.  This is certainly refreshing, since on the
whole the current Canadian administration has generally leapt at any
chance to put it to the Canadian firearms community.
My contact expressed the belief that a change in Canada's ITAR permit
exemption status by the United States cannot be accomplished solely by
Executive branch action, but must be cleared thru the Legislative
branch (Congress) too.  If that is indeed the case, it is much less
certain of approval, since the anti-gunners may control the US
Executive branch, but they don't control US Congress at this time.

Hi Cypherpunks and e$-ers.
After having read Adleman's Sci Am article, I couldn't help but ask him...  :-)
The following message is re-posted with his permission
==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
Thank you for the kind words regarding the Sci Am article. I have thought about
using DNA for breaking cryptosystems. It does appear convievable that a code like
DES could be broken. However, because RSA can simply increase the size of keys to
overcome whatever computing power DNA provides, I do not think it represents a
threat to RSA.
We of course have a long way to go to see whether we can actually get DNA to live
up to its potential.
If you are unfamiliar with quantum computation I think you might enjoy reading
about it - it, at least in theory, could represent a threat to RSA. I believe that
you can find info on the www.

Linda, here is a tidbit of information that you might get interested in...
The National Firearms Association has several times put a leash and curbed thoses rabbid dogs.  They procure you with ample legal information; just to point out to any govt bully how, per the letter of the law, they are committing a criminal act and how they could get charged.  THe thing is, if somebody comes from the states, it is unlikely that a) he/she will know Kanadian law and b) she/he will lay criminal charges.  The pertaining Kanadian laws should be widespread in the USA and maybe a cross-border entity could exist to promote the proper conduct of govt bully?
In any case, I suggest you ask the NFA about the whole thing of goods confiscation and criminal charges at the border.  Recently, there was a US citizen that entered Kanada with a handgun in his toolbox in his car trunk.  Oh, what a mess.  Here in Kanada, where the good Liberal dictators are convinced that Man is an intrinsically rabbid animal that will kill as soon as he has the means to layed criminal charges and seized this poor US chap cars and belongings and put him in the klink for a while.  Of course, in the US, a handgun could legitimately be carried in your toolbox and it is normal not to think of it as a *big thing* (tm), so it is legitimate to not think of it at the moment of border crossing.  Anyways, that's it, what happenend happened.  The NFA, I think, is working on it.
My telling of the story is subject to all sort of distortions and should not be considered reliable...  :-)  Contact the NFA and the Canadian Firearms Digest home page for more details...

"The government has no source of revenue, except the taxes paid by the producers.  To free itself -for a while- from the limits set by reality, the government initiates a credit con game on a scale which the private manipulator could not dream of.  It borrows money from you today, which is to be repaid with money it will borrow from you day after tomorrow, and so on.  This is known as "deficit financing."  It is made possible by the fact that the government cuts the connection between goods and money.  It issues paper money, which is used as a claim check on actually existing goods-but that money is not backed by any goods, it is not backed by gold, it is backed by nothing.  It is a promissory note issued to you in exchange for your goods, to be paid by you (in the form of taxes) out of your future production." -Ayn Rand

@_subject: Fwd: NEWS - NRA Charles Heston speech 
==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
Speech by National Rifle Association First Vice President Charlton
Heston Delivered at the Free Congress Foundation's 20th Anniversary Gala
December 7, 1997 I like it when the party of Lincoln honors our free heritage. This
nation has been blessed by the minds and mettle of many good people, and
indeed Abe was among the best. A man of great moral character... a trait
often lacking among our leaders. This is disturbing, but not without
remedy. One good election can correct such ills.
Above all, I hope those of us gathered here tonight have more in common
with Mr. Lincoln than just party affiliation. Better that we grasp a
common vision than simply wear the cloak. Even our President pretends to
be a conservative when it suits him. We must be more than that.
I know, I know... it is not easy. Imagine being point man for the
National Rifle Association, preserving the right to keep and bear arms.
Well, I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve... as a moving
target for pundits who've called me everything from "ridiculous" and
"duped" to a "brain-injured, senile, crazy old man."
Well, I guess that goes with the territory. But as I've stood in the
cross hairs of those who aim at Second Amendment freedom, I've realized
that guns are not the only issue, and I am not the only target. It is
much, much bigger than that  which is what I want to talk to you about.
I have come to realize that a cultural war is raging across our land...
storming our values, assaulting our freedoms, killing our self-confidence in who we are and what we believe, where we come from.
How many of you here own a gun? A show of hands?
How many own two or more guns?
Thank you. I wonder how many of you in this room own guns but chose not
to raise your hand? How many of you considered revealing your conviction about a
constitutional right, but then thought better of it?
Then you are a victim of the cultural war. You are a casualty of the
cultural warfare being waged against traditional American freedom of
beliefs and ideas.
Now maybe you don't care one way or the other about owning a gun. But I
could've asked for a show of hands on Pentecostal Christians, or
pro-lifers, or right-to-workers, or Promise Keepers, or school
voucher-ers, and the result would be the same. What if the same question
were asked at your PTA meeting? Would you raise your hand if Dan Rather
were in the back of the room there with a film crew?
See? Good. Still, if you didn't, you have been assaulted and robbed of
the courage of your convictions. Your pride in who you are, and what you
believe, has been ridiculed, ransacked, plundered. It may be a war
without bullet or bloodshed, but with just as much liberty lost: You and
your country are less free.
And you are not inconsequential people! You in this room, whom many
would say are among the most powerful people on earth, you are shamed
into silence!
Because you embrace a view at odds with the cultural warlords. If that
is the outcome of cultural war, and you are the victims, I can only ask
the gravely obvious question: What'll become of the right itself? Or
other rights not deemed acceptable by the thought police? What other
truth in your heart will you disavow with your hand?
I remember when European Jews feared to admit their faith. The Nazis
forced them to wear six-pointed yellow stars sewn on their chests as
identity badges. It worked. So what color star will they pin on our
coats? How will the self- styled elite tag us? There may not be a
Gestapo officer on every street corner yet, but the influence on our
culture is just as pervasive. Now, I am not really here to talk about the Second Amendment or the NRA,
but the gun issue clearly brings into focus the war that's going on.
Rank-and-file Americans wake up every morning, increasingly bewildered
and confused at why their views make them lesser citizens. After enough
breakfast- table TV promos hyping tattooed sex-slaves on the next Rikki
Lake show, enough gun-glutted movies and tabloid talk shows, enough
revisionist history books and prime-time ridicule of religion, enough of
the TV anchor who cocks her pretty head, clucks her tongue and sighs
about guns causing crime and finally the message gets through: Heaven
help the God-fearing, law-abiding, Caucasian, middle class, Protestant,
or even worse Evangelical Christian, Midwest, or Southern, or even
worse rural, apparently straight, or even worse admittedly
heterosexual, gun-owning or even worse NRA-card-carrying, average
working stiff, or even worse male working stiff, because not only don't
you count, you're a downright obstacle to social progress. Your tax
dollars may be just as delightfully green as you hand them over, but
your voice requires a lower decibel level, your opinion is less
enlightened, your media access is insignificant, and frankly mister, you
need to wake up, wise up and learn a little something about your new
America...in fact, why don't you just sit down and shut up?
That's why you don't raise your hand. That's how cultural war works. And
you are losing.
That's what happens when a generation of media, educators, entertainers
and politicians, led by a willing president, decide the America they
were born into isn't good enough any more. So they contrive to change it
through the cultural warfare of class distinction. Ask the Romans if
powerful nations have ever fallen as a result of cultural division.
There are ruins around the world that were once the smug centers of
small-minded, arrogant elitism. It appears that rather than evaporate in
the flash of a split atom, we may succumb to a divided culture.
Although my years are long, I was not on hand to help pen the Bill of
Rights. And popular assumptions aside, the same goes for the Ten
Commandments. Yet as an American and as a man who believes in God's
almighty power, I treasure both.
The Constitution was handed down to guide us by a bunch of those wise
old dead white guys who invented this country. Now, some flinch when I
say that. Why?
It's true...they were white guys. So were most of the guys who died in
Lincoln's name opposing slavery in the 1860s. So why should I be ashamed
of white guys? Why is "Hispanic pride" or "black pride" a good thing,
while "white pride" conjures up shaved heads and white hoods? Why was
the Million Man March on Washington celebrated in the media as progress,
while the Promise Keepers March on Washington was greeted with suspicion
and ridicule? I'll tell you why: Cultural warfare.
Now, Chuck Heston can get away with saying I'm proud of those wise old
dead white guys because Jesse Jackson and Louie Farrakhan know I fought
in their cultural war. I was one of the first white soldiers in the
civil rights movement in 1961, long before it was fashionable in
Hollywood believe me or in Washington for that matter. In 1963 I marched
on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King to uphold the Bill of Rights.
I'm very proud of that. As vice- president of the NRA I am doing the
same thing.
But you don't see many other Hollywood luminaries speaking out on this
one, do you? It's not because there aren't any. It's because they can't
afford the heat. They dare not speak up for fear of CNN or the IRS or
SAG or the ATF or NBC or even W-J-C. It saps the strength of our country
when the personal price is simply too high to stand up for what you
believe in. Today, speaking with the courage of your conviction can be
so costly, the price of principle so high, that legislators won't lead
so citizens can't follow, and so there is no army to fight back. That's
cultural warfare.
For instance: It's plain that our Constitution guarantees law-abiding
citizens the right to own a firearm. But if I stand up and say so, why
does the media assault me with such a slashing, sinister brand of
derision filled with hate?
Because Bill Clinton's cultural warriors want a penitent cleansing of
firearms, as if millions of lawful gun owners should genuflect in shame
and seek absolution by surrendering their guns. That's what is now
literally happening in England and Australia, of course. Lines long
lines of submissive citizens, threatened with imprisonment, are
bitterly, reluctantly surrendering family heirlooms, guns that won their
freedom, to the blast furnace. If that fact doesn't unsettle you, then
you are already anesthetized, a ready victim of the cultural war.
You know, I think, that I stand first in line in defense of free speech.
But those who speak against the perverted and profane should be given as
much due as those who profit by it. You also know I welcome cultural
diversity. But those who choose to live on the fringe should not tear
apart the seams that secure the fabric of our society.
Now I've earned a fine and rewarding living in the motion picture
industry, yet increasingly I find myself embarrassed by the dearth of
conscience that drives the world's most influential art form. And I'm an
example of what a lonely undertaking that can be.
Nobody opposed the obscene rapper Ice-T until I stood at Time-Warner's
stockholders meeting and was ridiculed by its president for wanting to
take the floor to read Ice-T's lyrics. Since I held several hundred
shares of stock he had no choice, though the media were barred. I read
those lyrics to a stunned audience of average American people the
stockholders who were shocked at the lyrics that advocating killing
cops, sexually abusing women, and raping the nieces of our
Vice-President. True, the good guys won that time though:
Time-Warner fired Ice-T.
The gay and lesbian movement is another good example. Many homosexuals
are hugely talented artists and executives... also dear friends. I don't
despise their lifestyle, though I don't share it. As long as gay and
lesbian Americans are as productive, law-abiding and private as the rest
of us, I think America owes them absolute tolerance. It's the right
thing to do.
But on the other hand, I find my blood pressure rising when Clinton's
cultural shock troops participate in homosexual-rights fund-raisers but
boycott gun- rights fund-raisers... and then claim it's time to place
homosexual men in tents with Boy Scouts, and suggest that sperm donor
babies born into lesbian relationships are somehow better served and
more loved.
Such demands have nothing to do with equality. They're about the
currency of cultural war money and votes and the Clinton camp will let
anyone in the tent if there's a donkey on his hat, or a check in the
mail or some yen in the fortune cookie.
Mainstream America is depending on you counting on you to draw your
sword and fight for them. These people have precious little time or
resources to battle misguided Cinderella attitudes, the fringe
propaganda of the homosexual coalition, the feminists who preach that
it's a divine duty for women to hate men, blacks who raise a militant
fist with one hand while they seek preference with the other, and all
the New-Age apologists for juvenile crime, who see roving gangs as a
means of youthful expression, sex as a means of adolescent
merchandising, violence as a form of entertainment for impressionable
minds, and gun bans as a means to lord-knows-what. We've reached that
point in time when our national social policy originates on Oprah. I say
it's time to pull the plug.
Americans should not have to go to war every morning for their values.
They already go to war for their families. They fight to hold down a
job, raise responsible kids, make their payments, keep gas in the car,
put food on the table and clothes on their backs, and still save a
little for their final days in dignity. They prefer the America they
built - where you could pray without feeling naive, love without being
kinky, sing without profanity, be white without feeling guilty, own a
gun without shame, and raise your hand without apology. They are the
critical masses who find themselves under siege and are
long for you to get some guts, stand on principle and lead them to
victory in this cultural war.
Now all this sounds a little Mosaic, the punch-line of my sermon is as
elementary as the Golden Rule. In a cultural war, triumph belongs to
those who arm themselves with pride in who they are and then do the
right thing. Not the most expedient thing, not the politically correct
thing, not what'll sell, but the right thing.
And you know what? Everybody already knows what the right thing is. You,
and I, President Clinton, even Ice-T, we all know. It's easy. You say
wait a minute, you take a long look in the mirror, then into the eyes of
your kids, your grandchildren, and you'll know what's right.
Don't run for cover when the cultural cannons roar. Remember who you are
and what you believe, and then raise your hand, stand up, and speak out.
Don't be shamed or startled into lockstep conformity by seemingly
powerful people. The maintenance of a free nation is a long, slow,
steady process. And it is in your hands.
Yes, we can have rules and still have rebels that's democracy. But as
leaders you must we must do as Lincoln would do, confronted with the
stench of cultural war: Do what's right. As Mr. Lincoln said, "With
firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us finish
the work we are in... and then we shall save our country."
Defeat the criminals and their apologists, oust the biased and bigoted,
endure the undisciplined and unprincipled, but disavow the
self-appointed social engineers whose relentless arrogance fuels this
vicious war against so much we hold so dear. Do not yield, do not
divide, do not call a truce. Be fair, but fight back.
It's the same blueprint our founding fathers left to guide us. Our
enemies see it as the senile prattle of an archaic society. I still
honor it as the United States Constitution, and that timeless document
we call the Bill of Rights.
Freedom is our fortune and honor is our saving grace.
Thank you.

The analogy of crypto =  padlock lack something.
A padlock can *always* pried open.  A court order can always be issued to open it.
So Joe Enforcment will be on it's way with it's crowbars, liquid N2, saws and/or torches and do his duty.  It will be no loss of time to him.
Strong encryption is different.  No matter what Joe Enforcment try, the crypto lock won't give away (well, at least, this is what we assume here).  Working on it means just one thing: absolute waste of ressources.
AFA Joe Enforcement is concerned, a gun has some of the same potentiality: try to force it and you also risk an absolute waste of ressources.  From a human standpoint, it might look different, but if you make abstraction of human life (like most dictators do), some of the effects are similar.

that effectively authorize national ID cards. One was a law to reform
health insurance that included a provision for a "Unique Patient

@_subject: Rememberance Day 1998. 
================= forwarded from CFD V2  ============
It is past eleven  O'clock here. It is November 11th, 1998.  On this
date every year
my mind always returns to thoughts of  my uncle, whose body, it's
elements long ago
 returned to the earth, the dust undisturbed in a European grave, the
man for whom I was
renamed when the sad news reached my mother and grandfather on that
early spring
morning many years ago. Even as child their wet faces impacted me,
It drifted today to Ottawa,  where I once stood cold but proud close to
one Paul Hellyer, then Minister of National Defense under the Honorable
Prime Minister  Lester Bowles  Pearson.
It was Rememberance Day, Paul was delivering the obligatory service
beside a Cenotaph,
the soldiers, sailors and airmen stood at ease waiting for the
ceremonies to end,
pretending to listen to his resonant,  educated voice. It was a bitter
cold day,
I knew they would prefer to be at their homes, or in their messes or
just anyplace but on parade that day.
I was proud to be associated with a government, indeed a country even,
with such diversity, such room for individuals to work, play and
overcome the challenges each would experience. It honestly was a Free
Canada, individuals could aspire to whatever their imaginations deemed
them worthy to become.
Later that evening, at a Military function, a member of the RCAF
suggested to me, each of us with the government issued glass in the
right hand, white serviette properly wrapped around it to keep the hand
warm and dry for handshaking, that someday he expected I would be
Minister of National Defense.  Sadly enough, we both believed it.
But today is November 11th, 1998, at about 11:50 AM.  My pride in the
Liberal Party of Canada has been shattered.  My belief that issues like
Conscription, which polarized our founding peoples for two generations,
would never surface, ever again, gone.   My belief that MY PARTY stood
for individual rights, the only force that would stand between the
Elite's and the common person, gone. Forever.  So it a doubly sad day
for me.  My uncle, and my Party. Bill C68 has intruded into the lives of so many Canadians, and if left
to stand as is, will undermine everything I stood there that cold Ottawa
morning to pay tribute, and everything my uncle died for in that foreign
field so long ago. He died with no idea the rifle he carried to fight
for our freedoms would become such a divisive symbol a few short years
On this morning I shall not revisit the implications of C68. Rather, I
will ask those struggling to preserve out heritage to continue the
fight.  Do not surrender.
Then, when it becomes our time to let our earthly possessions go, when
our bodies begin
the journey back to the dust from whence they came and our spirits
return to source, perhaps the cold white silk of the casket or the sides of the urn
holding our ashes will be a bit warmer knowing we did all we could for
those who follow.
Anything less of us would be shameful.

Note to elected officials: please inquire on this event an reply.
Thanks ========== forwarded from the Canadian Firearms Digest, V2  ========
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY TWO CENTS WORTH, THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE
SUBJECT WITH US....
1. Ask to see the search warrant.
NFA: The searchers are required to SHOW you a COPY of the warrant or
TELL you what is in it before executing it, and LEAVE you a copy of it
when they leave..
100% RIGHT, BUT WHEN THE PERSON POINTING THE MP-5 AT YOU TELLS YOU
TO SHUT-UP AND MOVE AWAY, WHAT WOULD SUGGEST ??
2. Ask the person in possession of the warrant to identify himself and
all of those with him and to indicate whether those persons are
authorized to aid in the execution of the warrant.
WITH 40 PEOPLE ALREADY TEARING THINGS APART AND AN ENTIRE SWAT
TEAM ON HAND HOLDING YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYEES AT GUNPOINT, THEY REFUSE TO
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES, HOW SHOULD WE IMPRESS THEM WITH OUR DEMANDS ??
TO ADD A BIT OF CHALLENGE TO THE AFFAIR MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE IN
CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND WORE NO ID....MOST OF THE TRUCK AND CARS WERE
UNMARKED.... HAD WE NOT TAKEN PICTURES WE WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW WHO HAD
"VISITED" US.
3. Request time to review the warrant and to obtain advice with
respect to the appropriate course of conduct.
EXCELLENT IDEA, WHEN I REACHED FOR THE PHONE TO CALL OUR LAWYER
TWO OF THE SWAT TEAM SMEMBERS WITH MP-5s POINTED AT ME INSTRUCTED ME "TO
GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THE PHONE" THE FACT THAT I TOLD THEM I WANTETO
CALL MY LAWYER DID NOT SEEM TO IMPRESS THAT AT ALL....
AS FOR HAVING TIME TO REVIEW THE WARRANT, THEY DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN
HEARING ANY ARGUMENTS ON THE SUBJECT....
IS THERE SOME OTHER APPROACH I SHOULD HAVE USED ??
4. Read the warrant carefully to determine: the premises covered
WE ADVISED THE OFFICER IN CHARGE THAT THIS WAS INCORRECT...."NOT
IMPORTANT" WAS THE REPLY
the specific documents or objects it covers
WE ALSO ADVISED THEM OF THE ERRORS IN THIS SECTION...."IT DOES NOT
MATTER" REPLIED THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE RAID....
 the alleged offence(s) subject of the warrant
NEW:  Read the DATE and TIMES that the warrant authorizes search. THESE POINTS WERE CORRECT....
Often, the warrant is invalid because they were supposed to do the
search YESTERDAY, or EARLIER TODAY, and entry can then be legally
refused.  CC s.  488 forbids the execution of a search warrant AT
NIGHT, unless "(a) the justice [who issues it] is satisfied that there
are reasonable grounds for it to be executed by night, (b) the
reasonable grounds are included in the Information [laid before the
justice to get the warrant], AND (c) the warrant authorizes that it be
executed by night."
5. At the same time that the warrant is being reviewed, instruct
someone to make the following calls (if not already made):
legal counsel I INDICATED ABOVE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE
ATTEMPTED TO USE THE PHONE, WE WERE SOME TIME INTO THE SEARCH BEFORE MY
WIFE WAS ABLE TO CALL OUR LAWYER....
individuals named in the warrant whose offices are to be searched
each should be advised that the search is pending and cautioned
that they must not remove, alter or destroy any documents or other material
in their offices.
HEY THAT MANY PEOPLE CARRYING SUB MACHINE GUNS,
SHOTGUNS, STUN GRENADES, HANDGUNS, ETC, ETC....HAVE MY INSTANT OBEDIENCE
GOOD LUCK, IN OUR CASE THEY CLOSED OFF OUR ROADWAY AND TURNED AWAY
EVERYBODY WHO SHOWED UP....
FEW PEOPLE APPRECIATE THE "HOSPITALITY" OF ARMED POLICE AT YOU GATE....
WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT THE NFA FOR SEVERAL HOURS....
"Am I under arrest?"  If the answer is "No, not YET!" then no one has
any right to TOUCH you, or to hinder your use of the telephone. WE TRIED THAT APPROACH BUT I'M A CHICKEN AT HEART, TWO MP-5s
POINTED AT MY MID-SECTION MADE ME THAT WAY....
 If an officer DOES touch you, then ask again: "Am I under arrest?"  If
the answer is no, then say:  "In that case, take your hand off me -- or I
will arrest YOU for assault."  [Yes, you ARE authorized to do that by
Canadian law, CC s. 494(1) and (3)].
6. Do not "agree" that the search can be expanded beyond the limits
described in the warrant. IN OUR CASE THEY DID ABSOLUTELY AS THEY PLEASED, THEY HAD GUNS AND
WE DID NOT....
7. Do not answer any substantive questions.
NFA: More people are convicted from what they SAY than from any other
cause.  You have a right to SILENCE.  USE IT.  Unless you know as much
about firearms law as the NFA does, you have NO IDEA whether or not
you ARE guilty - -- because you may SEEM to be guilty, and yet the NFA
can often tell your lawyer why you are NOT.  YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT....
8. Do not attempt to impede, physically or ot otherwise, the person
executing the warrant.  NFA: That is obstruction, and a criminal offence.
AND IF YOU HAVE A PUMPED UP BUNCH OF PEOPLE CARRYING AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS WITH FINGERS ON THE TRIGGER DON'T EVEN THINK OF GIVING THEM A
PROBLEM.... THESE PEOPLE WILL SHOOT FIRST AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER....THEY
PROVED THAT ON A NUMBER OF RAIDS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS....
9. If any documents exist in respect of which solicitor-client
privilege may exist, identify the documents and their location and
indicate to the search officer that the documents are subject to
solicitor-client privilege and that you require that the appropriate
procedures be followed to protect the privilege.
OH YEAH, THAT IS GAURANTEED TO IMPRESS THEM, HELL WE EVEN HAVE
PICTURES OF AN OFFICER STEALING DOCUMENTS....
10. Keep an accurate log (or copy) of all documents seized.   NFA: the
searchers are required to file an "Information" with the court to get
a search warrant.  Unless the justice blocks it, the "Information" is
a public document. After executing the warrant, the searchers must
file a "Return" with the court, explaining what they did with the
warrant and listing what they took.  SO: After being searched, go to
the court that issued the warrant and request a copy of the
Information and Return relating to that warrant.  You should be able
to get them for the cost of photocopying, and they are VALUABLE.
IN OUR CASE THEY SEALED THE WARRANT THEREBY DENYING ACCESS TO ALL
WHO ASKED.... THEY WILL GIVE YOU WHATEVER RECEIPTS THEY FEEL LIKE GIVING YOU....WHEN
THEY PLEASE....
ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS ACCURATE AND A MATTER OF COURT RECORD.
WE CHALLENGED THE WARRANTS AND THEY WERE DECLARED ILLEGAL....
WE CHALLENGED THE RAID UNDER TWO SECTIONS OF THE CANADIAN CHARTER, WE
I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS "DON'T EXPECT THINGS TO GO DOWN IN A
SMOOTH AND ORGANIZED MANNER, THEIR PEOPLE ARE RUNNING ON ADRENALIN, YOU
ARE UPSET AND NERVOUS, THE HEAD MAN IS TRYING TO IMPRESS HIS MEN,
DON'T BE A HERO, DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID, LIVE TO FIGHT
ANOTHER DAY.

Global initiatives present challenges to BVI
BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS - Proposed initiatives created for "combating
harmful preferential tax regimes" could present special challenges to offshore
financial centres such as the BVI, Chief Minister, Ralph O'Neal has told the
Legislative Council.
While the BVI Government has been cooperative with the international
community in its "ambitious attempts to create a new international standard,"
he said he welcomes the offer of the British Government to appoint a UK
financed consultancy to ascertain the full implication the proposed initiatives
will have on overseas territories.
Initiatives arose from recommendations made by the Organisation of
Economic Cooperative Development (OECD) as well as concerns expressed
by the European Union, and the group of seven major industrialized
countries, the G7. In September, a seminar was held to sensitise the overseas
territories to the attitude of the international community, the UK
Government's resolve to tackle harmful tax competition, and its commitment
to work with the overseas territories to ensure that their concerns were
factored into the ongoing dialogue on the harmful tax competition. Both the
Director of Financial Services and the Financial Secretary represented the
Of the concerns noted by the Chief Minister were OCED initiatives to counter
the spread to tax havens and harmful preferential regimes, and the creation of
an OECD list which classifies many countries including the BVI and other UK
overseas territories as tax havens.
He further noted "the fact that Luxembourg and Switzerland, both members
of the OECD, could choose to abstain from adopting the report and from
cooperating on the initiatives but still not appear in the OECD black list" is
viewed by some persons as "proof of some hidden agenda by ... the
industrialised world to reduce the attractiveness of offshore financial centres
for legitimate cross-border business."
"Our expectations of the new Labour Government are high. All we ask ... is
to help us to help ourselves and to ensure that the competition for cross
border financial services occurs on a level playing field," he added.
A special public sector/private sector task force has been commissioned to
brainstorm and develop the territory's response to the proposals. The Director
of Financial Services is the chairman.

"The government has no source of revenue, except the taxes paid by the producers.  To free itself -for a while- from the limits set by reality, the government initiates a credit con game on a scale which the private manipulator could not dream of.  It borrows money from you today, which is to be repaid with money it will borrow from you day after tomorrow, and so on.  This is known as "deficit financing."  It is made possible by the fact that the government cuts the connection between goods and money.  It issues paper money, which is used as a claim check on actually existing goods-but that money is not backed by any goods, it is not backed by gold, it is backed by nothing.  It is a promissory note issued to you in exchange for your goods, to be paid by you (in the form of taxes) out of your future production." -Ayn Rand

Well, maybe, maybe not.  It depends.  No use of becoming a martyr if nobody cares...  Blowing a SWAT team would be just the right thing to get forever in the klink, while blowing up the story over the net might blow-up the klinks themselves...  It is all a question of return on investment, and what price you can afford.  Happily enough, we now have strong encryption and the net.  There is much less need to spill blood in order to disseminate If the use of force was optimal, historically, we'd have been living in paradize since the first fight of all time happened.  Only, it doesn't work that way...
I wholeheartedly agree, but neither did they live in the same context.  Beside, it was the only way they could act.  Nowadays, we have the phone and the net.  But I agree that without threath of physical action, no govt (itself based ultimately on physical threath) will ever stop doing just as it pleases him.  Only, you don't have to come up with big house blow-up things.  Only the menace of physical resistance and of the dissemination of information suffice.  The govt is fed by the voluntary actions of the citizenry.  The day large groups decide to stop paying taxes, the govt will simply starve and grind to a halt.

Feds fear data sold rather than shredded: Huge cache of sensitive
government documents uncovered in Burnaby. The federal government believes tonnes of highly-sensitive material,
including tax records, unemployment insurance claims and parole records
were sold intact by a Lower Mainland company that was supposed to shred
and recycle the material, The Vancouver Sun has learned. Federal agencies found more than 110 tonnes of unshredded files in a
Burnaby warehouse last July that were being offered for sale by West Document Shredding (1995) Inc. But they have been unable to determine what happened to nearly another
200 tonnes they know the company was given by National Archives, the
federal agency responsible for disposing of classified and
non-classified documents no longer required by the government. And the amount of confidential material sent to  West that
wasn't shredded may actually be much higher -- as much as 600 to 700
tonnes -- said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, because the
company also obtained documents directly from a number of other
government departments . The RCMP's National Security Intelligence Service, which investigated
the security breach, believes all documents were sent to pulp mills for
recycling, even though they weren't shredded, Sergeant John Ward said. ``We're quite sure that no national security issues were compromised, at
least from our investigation. But I can tell you that we are not happy
about this at all,'' he said, adding that the issue involved a massive
breach of privacy. But John Billings, a regional director of Public Works, said he can't
say for certain the material didn't fall into the hands of people who
might use it for improper purposes. Sources said confidential information such as social insurance numbers
has a commercial value in criminal circles and can be used for such
purposes as obtaining false identification. According to a public works memo obtained by The Sun,  West
apparently sold the material unshredded because it could get a higher
price per tonne than if it had to tear it into unreadable strips as
required under the terms of its contract. Les Billett, the owner of  West, denied Tuesday he sold any
confidential documents intact. He said his company couldn't handle the
volume of material the government provided. Billett said only a small part of the 110 tonnes seized came from the
government. He said most of it was commercial office paper and estimated
that only 20 or so tonnes was government records. But Ward said police confirmed all of the material seized came from the
government, and that it was indeed being offered for sale unshredded. Many of the nearly 22,000 boxes sent for destruction contained what the
government calls ``designated'' or protected confidential information
originating from Revenue Canada, Citizenship and Immigration, Human
Resources, National Parole Board, Indian and Northern Affairs, and a
number of other departments. The RCMP was also among the agencies whose confidential documents were
found in the tonnes of material seized, he said. Most were low-level
security records from various detachments, as well as the E Division
headquarters, he said.  West's contract called for the company to obtain, shred and
recycle 400 tonnes of material from the National Archives warehouse in
Burnaby over a one-year period. It would also get up to 450 tonnes of
material directly from other agencies. In return,  West was supposed to pay the government $30.17 for
every tonne it took. Records show public works received at least $7,282,
meaning  West paid for about 241 tonnes of documents, Billings
said. But lading bills at the federal storage centre show  West
actually received 292 tonnes, not including any material obtained
directly from other agencies. ===================END FORWARDED MESSAGE===================

The FIN will be required on nearly all firearms, as few of them have a
well-documented system of Serial numbers that is KNOWN and PROVABLE.  Many
manufacturers -- especially manufacturers of military firearms for export --
duplicate Serial numbers with monotonous regularity.  Others recycle the
numbers -- as Iver Johnson did, numbering 9,000,000 revolvers with a machine
capable of only 99,999 numbers before starting to recycle.  Others,
particularly Eastern manufacturers, use digits and/or letters that the
registration system cannot handle (Cyrillic letters, for example).
There is no way to tell whether or not a particular Serial number is UNIQUE.
The word "unique" designates an absolute --  That is, it is guaranteed that
there is NO other firearm of that type with that Serial number.  That is a
standard that is clearly unreachable.  The Serial number is an indicator,
but it can never be certified as "unique" because there is always at least
the problem of fraud in the factory producing one or more firearms with
duplicated Serial numbers.  The above is a very muddled paragraph, which I split into two parts.  The
above section apparently identifies the three classes of firearms which can
be identified by the use of a permanent "sticky."  It offers the OPTION of
stamping of engraving the FIN on the "frame or receiver" of the firearm.
This second half of the paragraph (above) requires engraving or stamping of
the FIN on all other classes of firearms, such as all firearms manufactured
after 01 Dec 98. Fortunately, all of this is apparently NULL AND VOID.  No such requirements
may be demanded by the CFC or CFR/FRAS unless they are:
1.  required by the legislation (C-68's Firearms Act or Criminal Code), or
2.  the subject of an Order in Council authorized to be made by the legislation.
The legislation apparently says nothing whatever about where or how the
Serial number must be on the firearm, and does not mention the Firearms
Identification Number concept at all; therefore, the above requirements are
apparently null and void as far as the legislation is concerned.
The legislation does not authorize the making of any regulation regarding
markings on firearms, and therefore the above rules apparently cannot be
created by Order in Council.
Once again, this is apparently a defective attempt to amend defective
legislation by false pretences, and an attempt by the CFC and CFR/FRAS to
legislate -- but legislation is beyond their power, so this entire set of
requirements is apparently null and void.
A copy of this is being sent to the CFC and to CFR/FRAS.  CFC and CFR/FRAS,
this is a demand for an explanation as to why this apparently illegal and
misleading information was published and distributed. Please reply to the Canadian Firearms Digest with all possible speed, and
either explain why you think you had the authority to publish it -- or
publish a retraction.

Let me begin by commenting I know this is not a 'chat' digest, but the
question was raised here about Quebec/Maritime involvement if fighting
C68 [the new firearms registration bill].  To be fair, there is quite a bit
of work being done by individuals, but government is mute down there, and
for ecomonic reasons, must be.
The reluctance or simply because the populance had no personal arms of
men and women to fight back when their wives, children, possessions etc.
were  being taken away is however, as in Nazi Germany and Kosovo today,
is, I suggest, a major plank in Social Engineering of a Society.
am educated in Engineering and Philosophy, the former teaches system and
the latter teaches thinking on, I would argue, another scale.
The new so called 'Global' economy will, and already has, caused major
social upheaval.  People who were middle class a few short years ago are
now on the streets or almost there due to the relocaction of work to
countries with a lower wage scale. Mexico, India, two of which I have
first hand knowledge, the wages are less than %10 of North American
Workers and management both were'are being 'let go', out of a source of
income.  The stock market was inundated with large sums of cash, the
source was the money paid to let go people, their severance package.
Hence, the inflated price of shares, which the market is just now
correcting, to the detriment of retirement payouts from Mutual Fund to
these laid off workers.  Their future is bleak, to put it mildly.
Farmers must be, by international trade laws, cut off from government
support and assistannce, to give an example, hog and milk subsidies.
So they face a bleak future in Canada.  Quebec fought hard for Free
Trade, until the dairy and hog farmers read the fine print.  Now we had
a milk strike, annd as I write, the hog farmers in Quebec are raising
Jean Francois Avon wrote in response to my earlier diatribe on
Jews/Kosovians(I hope he copied this Digest) that Quebec Separatists
would be afraid of an armed populace.  I suggest he is correct.
So too are the federal and eastern Canadian provincial governments
afraid of guns in the hands of civilians.  They see them as weapons
which could be used against them and the establishment as the economy
changes and more and more middle class people, farmers, fishermen and
former managers reach the lower ranks of income and living conditions.
In Canada, we rank social standing by job/income/education to do a job.
We rated fur trappers at the bottom, because it payed poorly and
required little formal education to perform.
Tie in to Bill C68?  Well, Allan Rock let the cat out of the bag. When
he was briefed after becoming Minister of Justice, it was explained to
him that the program to disarm civilians began when Free Trade/Global
Economy talks were in their early stages, was running behind shedule.
In his jubulance, determined to 'get the job done', where Mulroney had
slowed down after an aggressive start, he blurted out the program on
live TV. 'Only police and the military should have guns'.
In the opinion of the various goverments, including Quebec, Ottawa and
some provinces, the program must be complete, and must be completed
soon.  Farmers, as they lose their farms to financial institutions,
fishermen, as they lose thier boats, certain interests in Quebec as they
lose everything due to separation, may fight back.  It is therefore
critical that they do not have access to arms, as a means of defence or
The War Measures act is gone, replaced.  A legal means had to be
manufactured to remove guns from the people.  Hence, C68 is a good
beginning.  It allows confiscation of any firearms so deemed by the
incumbent government later on.  No, my friends, Ottawa is not stupid,
this is a well thought out plan, and appears to be working, as they use
mass media on the population, to change public opinion to their side,
i.e., guns are dangerous especially to women and children.  In fact,
firearms in the hands of civilians are dangerous, but to repressive
governments from a displaced populace.  As more and more Canadians find
everything they worked for threatened, some MIGHT fight back, and shoot
the Bailiff's from the Banks and the police sent to protect them when
they re-possess their property and throw them, literally, on the
streets, on into their relatives homes.
Registration? Use of the harsh Criminal Code, jail, for
non-compliance??  Necessary, in Ottawa's view.  Get the job begun
earlier finished, then they can go on the the greater plan, more relaxed
when people have no means of defence or rebellion.
When you live on the streets, there is no place to hide a gun.  Not to
sound trite, but this will test 'unsafe storage' laws to the limit.
If the Supreme Court judges have been properly briefed on the Social
Engineering aspects of C68, we do not have a chance in Hell in the
courts. Then, we will have a search and seizure, after 2003, to actively
find and confiscate unregistered and illegal (by now) guns on farms, in
houses, examples made in the Press of a few, and the game is over.
Is this gloom and doom from me, or a realistic analysis of the
situation?  You decide, but at least think about it from a broader angle
than simply telling Ottawa how many, the serial number and storage place
of your firearms today.
We need only to look at the history of Scotland to see Quebec today and
the ROC tomorrow.  And C68 plays a huge role in this.

BBC - October 27, 1998
Watching Big Brother
By Internet Correspondent Chris Nuttall
The first annual awards defending the individual's right to privacy have
been made at a ceremony in London.
The 1998 UK Big Brother Awards were held on the 50th anniversary of the
writing of George Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four.
The pressure group Privacy International announced winners it judged to be
the modern-day equivalents of Big Brother in the novel, as well as
individuals who had fought to protect privacy, awarding them Winstons, the
name of the book's hero.
Privacy awards to go global
The academics, writers and lawyers who make up Privacy International
concentrated their first awards on the UK, but plan to extend them to other
countries over the next few years.
Hosting the awards, the activist comedian Mark Thomas said eight other
countries were interested in holding similar ceremonies next year.
The director of Privacy International, Simon Davies, said the time was now
right for the awards.
"Surveillance has now become an inbuilt component of every piece of
information technology on the planet, we've got a long way to go to wind the
clock back. I think these awards are the beginning of a movement," he said.
And the winners are ...
The Big Brothers were given for a number of categories:
Corporation: The British firm Procurement Services International received a
Big Brother award for selling surveillance equipment to Nigeria, Turkey and
Indonesia, three countries whose human rights records have been severely
Local government: Newham Council in London won for using its 140 street
cameras and facial-recognition software to try to pick out criminals in
National government: The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) was named a
Big Brother over its plans for the police to have access through a third
party to the keys to any information sent electronically that was locked by
Product: Software by Harlequin that examines telephone records and is able
to compare numbers dialled in order to group users into 'friendship
networks' won this category. It avoids the legal requirements needed for
phone tapping.
Lifetime achievement award: Menwith Hill in Yorkshire, a listening station
used by America's National Security Agency and described as the biggest US
spy station in the world, won this special award.
None of the winners were present to accept their awards. But a video was
shown of a receptionist at Newham Council receiving a Big Brother earlier in
the day and of several police dragging a Privacy International campaigner
out of the DTI's headquarters after he had tried to present it.
Winstons were awarded to three individuals, cited for campaigning at Menwith
Hill, documenting police surveillance and pursuing a privacy case against a
landlord who had installed a two-way mirror in a 19-year-old woman's flat.

Yesterday night, around 2am, I was unable to sleep and surfing the TV channels up until I fell on a movie on the ShowCase channel.  This channel is devoted to repertoire cinema and less mainstream movies.
As I flick to this channel, I see something I can't take my eyes off for it's overwhelming revolting topic:  a bunch of corpses are on a dolly, each of one being tied by the feet to a crane cable and quickly, efficiently taken away to a big heap of corpses.
Then, a lineup of peoples, waiting in line to pass before some officer.  They are promplty urged to take off their clothes, aligned to face a wall and shot in the back of the head.  And this continues like an dis-assembly chain.  I did not bear more than a few minutes of the thing.  During thoses few minutes, maybe five or six rows of five peoples were slaughtered.  Peoples of all walk of life, of all ages, young and olds, male and females, beautiful and ugly, strugling or resigned were executed by an indifferent row of unintelligent and/or psychotic thugs that simply "executed orders".  There was the firing squad captain that did not shoot but that gave the firing orders, so that the thugs could sleep without remorse.  There was their superior supervising the whole slaughterhouse operation and finally, there was the political supervisor, dressed in the "de rigueur" grey with grey hat.  This operation was clearly in the context of some political I did not comprehend the full details of the context, but it appeared that it was happening during the russian revolution, or more possibly in East Germany after WW-II.
The executed peoples were helpless, at the mercy of thoses thugs because they had no way to respond to death threat by death threat.  Most of them had accepted their fate and walked to their death attempting to defend themselves with calm reason, useless in this context since the firing squad was composed of idiots and psychotics.  One girls pleaded for her life and her great beauty made the animals of the firing squad hesitate, but was promptly shot in the head from a distance by the political supervisor.
And it dawned on me that it could never had happened in a society where gun ownership was unregulated, and it also dawned on me that it is the essence of the natural outcome of all gun regulation/registration schemes.  That to provide that kind of power  to the ruling political class is the ultimate goal of gun registration and regulation, notwithstanding that they chose to exert it or not.
Very soon (in principle on october 1st 1998), under the new bill C-68 , you will be declared a criminal in the full sense of the law, just as if you had killed somebody, if you don't register your guns (or don't plan to do so before the limit date comes up in a few years).
Putting aside for a moment the tremendous costs associated with that C-68 nonsense (around 2 billions $ wasted money) we must realize that private law-abiding firearm owners account for 0.08% of all homicides commited with a firearms.
So, I ask because I consider it of extreme importance, what's the ULTIMATE purpose of declaring criminal seven millions of individuals who wants nothing more than lead peacefull lifes?

***************** End of Quote **************************
I was in Rwanda during the latter part of the genocide and during the period
immediately following the Revolution. I concur with Mr. Avon. I have seen
the heaps of corpses. The deaths of these people is tragic and firearms
owners and free men and women should know what can happen if we allow
ourselves to be cowed by government.
It is worthwhile noting that contrary to the lies spewed by anti firearms
groups firearms do not kill people. Rarely were the people of Rwanda killed
by gunfire. They were killed in the tens of thousands with clubs and
machetes. Why did these people go to there deaths like sheep to the
slaughter? In my opinion they were so accustomed to unquestioning compliance
that even in the face of death they would not rise up and fight. At the
dozens of execution sites I encountered there were only two occasions where
I saw evidence of gunfire. This was in the form of shotgun casings. I
point this out because I questioned survivors about the procedures used by
the government forces to round up and execute the mass numbers of people we
are talking about here.
Consistently, I was told that the government forces, with the assistance of
collaborators, would either threaten the village leaders or convince them
that they would be spared if they complied. They then moved the group
en-mass to a collection point. At this time the villagers still complied
with the butchers. Once a sufficient number of people were collected they
would be slaughtered. The ratio of killers to victims would be quite small
so if they had risen up as a group there could have been mass escape. This
did not happen. There were exceptions . . . this is where the shotgun
shells come in. There would be a couple of government soldiers with guns to
cut down anyone that fled. In the Amahoro stadium in Kigali the bodies were piled one on top of
another. Approx. 25,000 Rwandans were slaughtered there over a period of
just a few days. In a small church and grounds on the road North from
Cyangugu another 10,000 where slaughtered, hacked and bludgeoned to death. Of all the sensory overloads I experienced, one of the most memorable was
that of a school in a village near the Eastern town of Byumba. The men and
women were separated, which was fairly common, and then slaughtered. As
usual they were not JUST killed but were hacked to pieces. Limbs were often
chopped off first, brutal torture and emasculation was common before a
merciful death was delivered by a fatal blow or machete wound. One of the dead was a young woman, her skull had been crushed with a club,
upon examination of the body I saw that she still clutched her infant child
to her chest. The skull of the child too was crushed. Drunk on the
absolute power given to them by the government the soldiers and Intehamwe
collaborators became blood thirsty fiends capable of killing a baby in such
a brutal manner. (there were worse things but this has imprinted on my
In the center of the hollow square arrangement of huts were 2 twelve gauge
casings . . . someone had tried to escape!
There may be those who don't feel this information is topical or appropriate
for the Digest as it is not directly a firearm issue. I believe there are
some lessons.
1. Never have blind trust in the government when it comes to your or your
loved ones life(a la Hep C).
2. There will always be collaborators, help your neighbor but never trust
them completely.
3. Alone we are vulnerable, it is only through a unified group that you
stand a chance against oppression.
4. To find out what a man is, give him power.
5. To murder masses, the mass murder does not need a specific tool.
6. Police and soldiers should never be the only ones with guns.
(My credo, re-enforced by my experiences), As a free man I will not die on
my knees.
I submitted a quote to the list some months back. If the moderator will
indulge me I would like to submit it again.
"War is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and
degraded state of moral and patriotic feelings which thinks that nothing is
worth war is much worse. A man who has nothing for which he is willing to
fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a
miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so
by the exertions of better men than himself." - John Stuart Mill

background: the CFC finally spit out the revised estimate of
registration until the end year 2002:
        120 millions in set up costs
        240 millions for operation (60 M per year for 4 years).

This is the complete quote from Alan Rock, then justice minister who pushed the gun control, registration and confiscation bill (C-68).
"I came to Ottawa with the firm belief that the only people in this
country who should have guns are police officers and soldiers."

(Wed, 23 Sep 1998 Subject: a few impressions on the rallye)
    - Quebec is waking up and joining in
    - the ban on "purse-sized" pepper spray -- that says it all.
    -   60 millions/year forever for gun control bureaucrats,
         4 millions/year for 5 years for cancer research
        38 women murdered with a firearm last lyear        3900 women died of breast cancer last year
        if this is not a feminist issue, what is ?
    - the 60 million/year maintenance cost is almost as high as the
      "total 7-year cost" of 85 millions promised for the entire program.
       by 2015, the total tab will be 1 billion dollars.
    - the gripping testimony of John St-Amour (Marstar)
        - the brutality of the search for mere _papers_
           SWAT with the finger on the trigger of HK MP-5 weapoons
           and using the weapons to point where to go to
        - the systematic harrassment of the government pursuing a non-
              case demanding St-Amour plead guilty to some trivial charges
              as condition  to stop this 3-year long harrassment
        - over $100,000 in legal fees
        - the role of Canada Customs, describing St-Amour as "violent"
        - the government has unlimited funds (taxpayers' money) and can
          outspend anyone and drag anyone through court forever
        - trumped-up charges of "unsafe storage" to justify the fiasco.
        - this can happen to _anyone_.  C-68 allows searching for               records, unsafe storage charges are routinely fabricated
Spin doctoring from McLellan [minister of Justice]
    - talk of confiscation is paranoid
    - the registry will be cost-effective
    - used weeping mothers of Polytechnique killings as prop for C-68

====== forwarded from Canadian Firearms Digest, V2 # 605 ==========
To the Editor, Halifax Herald:
Regarding your "Sticking to their guns" article. I would like to correct
a few inaccuracies in your piece.
1> "..to join about 8,000 others at the Fed Up II Rally.." - the RCMP
estimate was 30,000 people, one of the largest if not THE largest rally
ever on Parliament Hill.
2>"The new law, Bill C-68, will come into effect on Dec. 1, two months
after it was first scheduled to be implemented." NO, this is the FIFTH
extension of it's implementation date, now totalling three years.
3>"Ms. McLellan said the delay was at the request of Ontario law     enforcement officials and not due to problems with the federal       government's new system." FALSE, only 8 days before the law was
scheduled to go into effect, gun dealers and Police departments still do
not have the information on how to comply with the law. Confirm this
with the Provincial Firearms Officers - they don't have the information
yet. The fault is Federal. I asked gun dealers here and confirmed this
with them, they still have nothing from the Federal government.
4>"Ms. McLellan said the program is still expected to cost about $185
million over the first five years" NO, they've already spent $135
million (that they'll acknowledge) THIS YEAR ALONE, and $250+ million so
far in 3 years before registering a single firearm and they claim $60
million annually to run it. That's impossible since the current handgun
registration system costs just under $100 per gun to register and with
estimates (RCMP) of up to 25 million guns in Canada, that's $2.5 BILLION
to do the job. Add to that the $200 million the Canadian Police
Association must have to upgrade it's computer system to use the data
from this system, the price is now somewhere around $3 Billion. That
would help a lot of Hep-C victims and cancer patients.
5>"The minister also denied the government has a secret agenda to confiscate everyone's guns and use the registry to let the police know
where to find firearms." False, since the goverment has already
announced that they're turning 58% of the legitimately owned handguns in
Canada into prohibited firearms and confiscating them without
compensation. (Also illegal under the Charter of Rights) As for the
Police access to the information - that was the main selling point by
the Liberals to get the Canadian Police Chiefs to agree to support it.
They were to have this information before going into a house to be
prepared for any eventuality. They've now been informed that the system
won't give them that information. The support of main line Police
officers doesn't exist either. 85-91% of officers surveyed in several
provinces (where their leaders would allow the survey to be done) say
that they don't support the law.
Please, lets keep the facts straight on this. There are 7 million people
in this country who own firearms (RCMP estimates) and they're all voters
and taxpayers. The utter waste of some $3 Billion on something with
early estimates of a minimum 50% error rate (from the Ministers Select
group of firearms experts) that will do nothing to combat crime since
criminals won't register their guns and 90% of firearms crime (RCMP
figures) is done with unregistered handguns which have had mandatory
registration since 1934, cannot be tolerated. The NFA put together a
system of firearm owner licensing some 30 years ago that would take care
of most of what the government theoretically wants to accomplish with a
very low cost. They refuse to consider it. The existing handgun registry
has an estimated 30-45% error rate and even the courts refuse to accept
data from it in court since it's so inaccurate. The Federal government can't even get their figures straight, since
their numbers don't match either the RCMP or StatsCan figures for crime
rates. They were caught inflating RCMP crime figures by 900% to
strengthen their case in the Alberta Court of Appeal. They used the
argument that even if a firearm was present at a location (locked in a
gun safe and not involved in the crime) then it was a firearm crime.
That's like saying that if there's a domestic dispute in a home and
there's a car in the driveway then it's an automobile accident. That
doesn't wash with me, I don't know about you.
Please, lets keep the facts straight so that your readers can make an
accurate assessment of the news, not a distorted one.

Mainly.  But it is also *highly* concerned by the ethics and politics
of it.  Guns and crypto are, at the abstraction level, extremely
similar and therefore, it is not surprizing to see govt react the same
to both topic.  An individual's specific psycho-epistemology and definition of Man
will, usually, lead to the same conclusions on theses two apparently
different topics. Arms are NOT my concern, my concern is Freedom.  Guns are not for
anything in particular, they *are*.  Your choice to prefer to shoot
peoples than game or targets or simply to engineer a  more performing
piece of hardware is what you choose to do with it.  And is happens
that by the nature of them, e.g. the capacity to exert coercion at a
distance, they are the ultimate tools of choice of governments, which
by nature, are coercives.  Govts have their roles.  History has shown
over and over again ad nauseaum that govts are *dangerous* entities if
taken over by a certain category of individuals.
In order to defend the freedom of the individual, guns, i.e. tools of
tele-coercion are the ultimate deterrent.  Ask any american about it. Or consult the Constitution of the United States and see Thomas
Jefferson's explanation for the reason of the second ammendment.

the German gun control laws were enacted by the "liberal" Weimar Republic government that preceded Hitler, and were a strong aid to his coming to power -- because they disarmed Hitler's opponents, and Hitler's adherents ignored them -- as criminals have always ignored gun control laws.
Disarming the public is a frequent first step toward dictatorships and genocides.  Once the disarming is complete, the public is helpless against those who have the guns.        -------------------------------------------------

==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, Sydney.    Sept 27.by Wayne Jones.
A MAGISTRATE has dismissed charges against a 165 year old boy who faced
jail for possessin a toy cap gun.
The magistrate, Hal Halenstean, made the decision after hearing what he
described as a "silly case" on Friday.
"We all have better things to do", Mr Halenstein said,
The boy, who cannot be identified bought the toy cap gun from a toy
stall at Victoria's Dandednong Market on May 12.
Minutes later, police looking for drug dealers found the cap gun in the
boy's jacket. They charged boy with several firearm offences which carry
a jail sentence.
In court, Mr Halenstein twice gave prosecutors on opportunity to
withdraw the charges against the boy, but police indicated they would
continue to contest the case.
Using special provisions of the Sentencing Act, Mr Halenstein then
dissmissed the charges.
The boy's barrister, Arend Slink, said the court case had set a
precedent under the new gun laws. Toy cap guns could no longer be
classed as prohibited weapons, he said.
"If there is any sinister intent there are a range of serious charges
that a person could be charged with. "Mr Slink" said"But in the case of
a child possessing a toy cap gun a precedent has now been clearly set".
The Sunday Telegraph reported on May 24 the boy could face jail if found
guilty of the swrioud gun charges, which included:
# Being a non-prohibited person did possess/carry a handgun which was
not registered. # Being a non-prohibited person did possess/ carry a handgun which ge
did not have a licecnce for under part two of the Firearms Act 1996.
# Did own a handgun whilst not authorissed by a licence under the
Firearms Act 1996 to possess a firearm.
Police had alleged the toy gun was consedered an imitation firearm inder
strict new gun laws and therefore deemed to be a prohibited weapon.
The toy gun bought by the boy is one of thousands soldacross the state. The boy said he had bought the toy cap gun with pocket money.
THE END.

Excerpt from the Canadian Firearms Digest, V2 ================ begin forwarded opinion ===============
I have just learned from a highly reliable confidential source that in addition to the .50 cal  McMillian sniper rifles and the untalked about Barrett Light .50's, the RCMP  have now added to  their arsenal a number of .50 cal. Browning Machine Guns. Staff from the RCMP are headed to Belgium to be trained in the armoring of these military heavy  machine guns. Machine guns may at some point be used against the Canadian public, possibly to  quell a native disturbance or other civil unrest. If we were attacked by outside forces the military  would be the pressed into service, as this is not the role of the RCMP. This leads one to ask what use the RCMP, who are a police force not an army in occupation,  would have for such heavy armament ...... or is it possible that I have it wrong, possibly they are  now an army in occupation. Is it possible that the RCMP are now the political policing arm of the  Government. The lethality of this weapon makes pepper spray look like a Sunday shower. Maybe this is the  next weapon demonstrators will be facing at the orders of the PM's office.

Ciao all.
