  Subject: CDR: The Electromagnetic Bomb
  E-Bombs generate electromagnatic pulse which destroys any and all electric current running in any particular area it is detonated in. E-Bombs are a national threat and are being sold on the black market for $400 to terrorists. For the place that is being hit, it wipes out all electricity and is said to destroy all of the technological advances within the past 200 years. Basically they generate a large magnetic pulse (with a large coil of wire) which has a lot of current running through it. Then the chemical inside explodes touching the coil of wire causing it to be a moving short circut. When it hits, all current running through any metal or electricity-using object is destroyed. Terrorists in the middle east along with Iraq have been said to be researching this bomb for several years and have become a large threat to the United States. I hope that answers your question

('wire rats' is a reference to rats w/ electrodes implanted in their brains that allow them to self-stimulate at any interval, ahahh, now women have the same ability)
Implant Achieves Female Orgasm Wired News Report 12:25 p.m. Feb. 7, 2001 PST One woman undergoing treatment for back pain may have discovered a cure for the thousands of woman frustrated by the inability to achieve orgasm. While Dr. Stuart Meloy was putting an electrode into the woman's spine in an attempt to ease her chronic pain, he not only reduced her back pain, but gave her an unexpected -- but delightful -- side-effect. "She said, 'You're going to have to teach my husband how to do that'," Meloy, an anesthesiologist and pain specialist in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said. The discovery is published in Wednesday's issue of New Scientist. See also: How "Doing It" Is Done

Unexpectedly, Meloy had stumbled onto a solution that could help thousands of women who can't achieve orgasm. Recognizing the opportunity, he patented this use of the device, and is trying to work with Medtronic, a Minneapolis company that makes the spinal cord stimulator, to market it as a remote-control orgasm machine. Meloy hopes human clinical trials will begin later this year. An Orgasmatron like in the movie Sleeper is probably not around the corner, however. Even for back pain, the device is used only after all other possibilities are exhausted. The procedure is about as invasive as a pacemaker, Meloy said. Still, Meloy hopes the effect is reproducible. He's witnessed induced orgasms twice so far, he said. To treat back pain the surgeon places an electrode in a precise spot in the patient's spine in order to find the specific nerves carrying his or her pain signals to the brain. Meloy said that to induce orgasm, the stimulating wires could connect to a signal generator smaller than a packet of cigarettes implanted under the skin of a patient's buttocks. "Then you'd have a hand-held remote control to trigger it," he said. Various issues can cause a woman to have difficulty achieving orgasm, said Jim Pfaus, who studies the neurobiology of sexual behavior at Concordia University in Montreal. "Some women confuse what's called sympathetic arousal (in orgasm) -- like increased heart rate, clammy hands, nerves and so on -- with fear," he said in a statement. "That makes them want to get out of the situation." The problem is often treated with psychotherapy or Valium, but the drug can also delay orgasm, Pfaus said. Meloy said he hopes the device will help couples overcome problems associated with orgasmic dysfunction. "If you've got a couple who've been together for a while and it's just not happening anymore, maybe they'll get through it a bit easier with this," he said. He added that the device could be programmed to limit its use. "But whether it's once a day, four times a week -- who am I to say?"

I seriously doubt unbreakable snooping software will be made a legal requirement in the next few years.  I mean, if you switch to say, BSD, who are they going to impose the task of adding features, like 'rights management' on?
All i'm trying to say is its pretty easy to screw over any software gimmicks they come up with, but levying a fine against you when you by a computer?  thats crap.  And even if they impose a tax anyway, who is to stop them from imposing the dreaded "snooping software" later, under some different Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at

I really really doubt the enzyme responsible for catalysis would survive ten seconds of high grade peroxide.  Peroxide I think is a dead end, its a low energy fuel, w/ two products, water and oxygen.  The oxygen is high energy, perfect for oxidizing another fuel, but you would have to worry about the water suppressing that reaction.

@_subject: Pravda Propaganda On The NRA, GOA and Militias 
This article touches on a note that irritates me, a pro-Capitalist, pro-gun
American.  The fact that many militias, 'right winger's' and so on are
claiming that
"global corporations, the wealthy, and ruling-class billionaires as being
behind the plot to take away America's Second Amendment rights. "
I'll agree that global corperations (such as lowe's) and "ruling-class
billionaires" (such as George Soros) are 'behind the plot to take away 2nd
amendment rights.  But generalizing that to "the wealthy" is a big mistake.
By allying with 'populists' and nationalists, we could see the NRA
supporting protectionism, stronger Union laws, and other anti-capitalist
So should libertarians do to fight the NRA's trend left, as well as the
"liberal power-elite"
