@_subject: NSLs, gag-orders, code-changes, coerced backdoors - any tech 
Really?  From the MIT Press's blurb:
"In Protocol, Alexander Galloway argues that the founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures. Instead of relying on established theoretical approaches, Galloway finds a new way to write about digital media, drawing on his backgrounds in computer programming and critical theory. "Discipline-hopping is a necessity when it comes to complicated socio-technical topics like protocol," he writes in the Oh dear.

I think that this cannot be used in evidence. The plain fact is that the
German government will pay only a fraction of what a company would pay.
 As an example (even though not one that could be applied to a job with
the federal government as a civil servant, but which I nevertheless
believe to be comparable), a PhD being paid according to the pay grade
known as TVöD 14 Step 1 will take home a base salary of roughly 1700
Euros, after taxes.  Also, prospects for promotion are slim and the
bureaucracy is terrible and cannot be evaded.
