Hi all,
Just a reminder that the next general meeting will be held on January 7,
1996 from 6-8pm at the Central Market HEB on N. Lamar at 42nd.
We will be discussing further issues related to the video and setting a
schedule of meetings and deadlines for various production points.
Hope to see you folks there!

While it is quite possible to obtain equipment and supplies from any
reputable science supply center (I like Brodehead-Garrett & Cenco myself) it
is not cheap. The type of equipment that can be made out of aquaria and such
is very low-level and poses little threat *provided* isolation proceedures
are taken. The types of 'genetic' experiments that can be done at this level
are quite simple and generaly explore characteristics that are based on the
crossing models of Mendelson. Most of the threat of this type of experiments
are from simple infections since viruses are not easily raised with this
form of equipment.
One of my favorite 'technology rulers' is when the first strain of commen
yeast is released which produces THC or LSD. Both of these chemicals are
relatively simple to produce at a cellular level and Marijuana was
completely mapped just a couple of years ago. Yeast has been mapped for
several years and there is a whole technology of protocols based around
using it (or E. Coli) for laboratory experiments into secondary and tertiary
production systems in cells. The reason that I use Marijuana or LSD as a
test is that neither are the result of direct protein synthesis. They are
rather produced as a result of cellular metabolism of primary componants.
Both of these require garage level control and access to only the most basic
tools and sequencers. To do this successfuly will require somebody to take
the necessary genomes out of the choromosomes and then using a virus and
suitable cutting agents insert them in the yeast. I do not believe we will
see this in the near term using the micro-manipulater systems which do
direct injection of genetic material because of the cost and utility
requirements of such equipment.
E. Coli can be quite toxic. The people who died last year because of the bad
burger at the Jack In The Box died from E. Coli. There are hundreds of
strains of Esherichi Coli and not all of them are benign.
There is also a long history of this type of experimentation, it is not new.
Scientific American put out a book in the late 50's and early 60's that had
a whole slew of 'Amateur Scientist' articles compiled and several of them
related to this technology.

Actualy, it measures doppler shift as well.
Seems to me that standard satellite tracking software would work just fine
for this once the correct orbital parameters were included. To get the
necessary orbital parameters look on sci.space.news and they are announced
If you can measure the accuracy you can spoof it. It is only a question of
cost at that point.
Which are going to be turned off. I have to draw exception to the
'dithering' in regard to the lsb's of the data. They are actualy encrypted.
It is not random which is what 'signal instability' implies. Were it random
then a 'flying capacitor' type filter or a digital filter could get the bits
out. I have two years of experience using such 'flying capacitor' type
filters in LORAN-C equipment I calibrated and repaired for Austron. The
signal on LORAN is a damped sinusoid, very precisely damped. The timing
sequence of sites are drawn on maps as well as published in book and
electronic form. You set the filter for the same repeat rate as the signal
you wish to detect. As the signal is fed over and over into the bank of
capacitors the random noise cancels out and you are left with a remarkably
clean signal. You then feed this to a 2055 microstepper (nS/S) and compare
it to a time reference standard (1210 Time reference standard, my
specialty). When the signals cancel you can get a very accurate reading and
change that to lat/long quite easily. I would regularly sync the 1210's to
USNO and the NIST to measure the oven heated crystal oscillators drift in
frequency over time. By applying a voltage to the circuit you can compensate
for this drift using a 2055 microstepper (a time delay unit). At that time we
were making both the 2000 and 5000 series receivers. The 68000 based machine
was due out when I left for a job at UT Austin. The neatest part of the job
was flying cesium beams around the world and measuring their drift to
accurately measure the rotation rate of the Earth.
You can defeat even the encryption if you take a long enough time to
interpolate. The reason it isn't done is that by the time you get the fix the
target you were going to shoot your missile at is gone. If it is so large (a
city) or slow (grunts) that it won't move significantly in that time you
don't need that accuracy in the first place. I base this on a years worth of
technical support I did for CompuAdd for Desert Shield/Storm. I handled
several problems related to MLRS and Naval systems related to target
selection and tracking & GPS in regards our computers.
Which would be enough to scramble the signal as well. As a matter of fact
this might create another means of attack. Namely that the orbit varies is a
given. That the orbit can be predicted to quite good accuracy in less than
real-time is a given. By comparing these to the actual orbit it might be
possible to creat a situation where a fake signal was more accurate than the
real signal making the receiver filter the real signal as noise. The one
drawback here is that it would require considerable power to effectively
impliment the masking.
; the variations in signal timings won't provide
The doppler shift directly corresponds to altitude. If you have the normal
orbital parameters it is a relatively simple matter to use a computer to
predict where it will be in the near future (5 minutes). NASA and United
States Space Command (USSC) regularly track over 8,000 items in orbit. Some
as small as bolts. Tracking accuracy is a well understood problem.
Anybody got a GPS receiver in Austin? I believe I can arrange the necessary
equipment and support to attempt it. I know several EE's as well as
somebody with commercial radio service equipment I am shure some of the
other local cpunks might want to help as well. I propose that what be
attempted is making a GPS receiver believe it is 100 miles from where it
actually is.
I will forward a copy of this to the Experimental Science Instrumentation
mailing list (tesla at ssz.com) to see if anyone on there might be interested.

I would counter and say that there is no distinction between free speech and
promoting said speech. How does one say one party has the right to make a
statement and a second party does not have the right to agree? The whole
point of freedom of speech is to prevent limitations on distribution of
information (aka speech, writting, source code, executables, video, audio
tapes, etc.). Even use of these materials (ie running a virus) would not
violate either the spirit or the letter of the law unless it harmed another
person or somehow took advantage of their property (physical or
intellectual) without their prior consent.                                              Jim Choate

@_subject: Freedom of speech question... 
It is a commenly held belief that shouting 'fire' in a crowded theatre is a
crime because of the potential for harm to persons and property. It is one
of the most commen examples given for limiting freedom of speech even though
the Constitution says "Congress shall make no law...". This view is proposed
as a equaly valid rationale for limiting crypto, virus technology, drugs,
My question to the list is would it be a crime if you were alone in the
theatre? If you developed a virus and didn't distribute it would that be a
crime? If you give it to one person is it a crime? How about if you give it
to millions? How many people must know a fact, posses source code or
executable. In short, does freedom of speech rest on how many people are
aware of your expression?
My position is that if you answer in the affermative then you are basicaly
stating there is no freedom of speech. It should be perfectly permissible
to shout 'fire' in a theatre filled to the brim. If anyone takes you
seriously and is harmed then you should be liable for the damage. Your right
to shout 'fire' is not relevant. If you accept the premise then what you are
buying into is preemptive justice, in short judging somebody guilty by what
they might do, not what they have done. If this is permitted then we have a
serious problem in that anyperson is therefore guilty of whatever crime is

What is described is not self-defence by any stretch of the imagination. It
is a pre-meditated act which causes any plea of self-defence to fail.
If it is wrong for an individual to kill another except in immediate

individual or group unless there is an immediate threat to the group.
Capital punishment by governments is wrong under any conditions. If you
seriously believe it is ethical for a government to kill another then please

How many people have to decide that another should be killed for it to be

But it is not clear at all. Exactly how do their actions violate your
rights? Are these the rights that you believe that you possess or the ones
that are recognized? Do the actions have to effect you directly and
immediately or must you merely percieve a threat? All of these issues are
unclear in your presentation. And for the final one, doesn't your putting a
contract out on them violate their rights (life, liberty, the pursuit of
hapiness)? The only answer to this is 'yes', meaning that to be ethical you
must put a contract out on yourself. Because your own actions violate somebodies rights. This catch-22 situation regarding deadly force is why
anarchy does not work. A perhaps less different example might be: If you
dislike bigots then you are a bigot. In short, you can't help but become
what you hate the most. It pays not to hate or be quick to use violence
since they are so strongly related.
It is not yours, the governments, or anyone elses right to decide who lives
and dies. You have a double standard.
Then Lincoln had a equaly weird view: Government of the people, by the
people, for the people. Perhaps this failure to recognize a basic premise of
representative democracy explains your apparent dichotomy in the concepts of
rights. In effect, your rights and their rights. When in fact there is no
I would suggest you read the Declaration of Indipendance and the Gettysburg
Address (again) to get a better perspective on what and who is supposed to
run this government and how. We have had a basic inversion of how our
government is supposed to work. In short, if there is a question the federal
government is supposed to bow to the will of the people and the states.
Currently the states and people bow to the federal government.
Somehow, I think that this is where  your argument fails, and it fails Might does not make right. Ethical cohesion does not rest on numerical
values. In case you have missed my comments before. I am not non-violent. I
do not support the use of violence in any format except in direct and
immediate self-defence. In which case make the beggars eyes bleed, no defeat
and no surrender. This means that if you walk outside and see a person
breaking in your car that in and of itself is not sufficient motive for
deadly force unless they attack you. I do believe (contrary to yourself I
would guess) that if you were walking down the street and somebody suddenly
grabbed you that would be sufficient motive to kill them in self-defence. In
cases like this there simply isn't enough time to evaluate the extent of the
threat, it is clear there is an apparent threat though. In short if your
person is violated physicaly without your premeditated permission then deadly
force is justified. I also believe that you are ethicaly justified in
stopping a person from assaulting or killing a 3rd party for the simple
reason that it could be you next. However, once that immediate threat is
over (for example a 4th party knocks the gun out of the muggers hand and
knocks them on the ground) then use of deadly force is not justified.
Rights as you use them are only relevant between a government and a citizen.
I as an individual person am not forced to provide you with a forum for free
speech or any other rights guaranteed in the constitution. Apparently you,
as many people do, confuse the rights that are yours in regards the
government with privileges and contractual obligations which govern
interpersonal actions. The local grocery store is not mentioned in the
Constitution. They are under no obligation to provide protection for your
life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness. Your basic argument rests on a straw
man premise, namely that rights guaranteed you by government are guaranteed
you by any and every other possible entity. This is clearly wrong.
It is not ethical to kill another simply for being a burglar. How much must
they steal before you are ethicaly justified in killing them? A $1,000
dollar stereo? Perhaps a $.20 pencil off your desk? Does this not justify
your employer killing you for using their machines for your own use,it is
theft of services after all (and you are on their property). If you have
sufficient force detain them. The legal system will take them from there
(assuming of course we revamp it with the other laws we discuss so heatedly
on here). What I propose is a simple and humane system. If a person commits
a crime which leads to the death or injury another they spend the remainder
of their life in a solitary cell with no chance of parole. In other cases
what should occur is they must work a regular job and provide restitution
for an extended period (ie $100/mo. to you for 30 years). Should they fail
to abide by this or they commit another crime then off they go for 20 years
or so, again with no chance of parole. I also strongly object to plea
bargaining. The whole concept of sending somebody to jail for 2-3 years is
silly and counter-productive. It leads to nothing but professional criminals,
in effect state run training grounds for the criminaly inclined. While in
jail they should be forced to live in work camps and not prisons as we
currently know them (unless they fall into the above 'harm another'
category). What should occur is that they are forced to live a relatively
normal lifestyle. In short, they work 8 hours a day and must pay for their
housing, food, etc. from their earning. What needs to occur is to train
persons to make a living and gain some success at managing a day to day
lifestyle. Our currrent system treats criminals as animals, which does
nothing to prevent further violence on their part, it only increases any
sense of isolation they may have.
No, as I have said on many occassions, I am a strict Constitutionalist.

Hmmm, you should have some kind of Public Utility Commission (PUC) in your area
that regulates the service provider. Here in Texas if SWBT received more
than 2 complaints on a single problem without resolution then the customer
can request that the PUC force a resolution of the problem. It has the power
to fine SWBT on a per day basis until the problem is resolved. I have used
the process one time to a successful end. I had squirrels that kept eating
my phone lines when I first put in my ISDN and its dial-in lines. SWBT kept
comming out and repairing the lines and the squirrels kept eating them. I
asked for armored cables and was refused. I kept requesting them (and
keeping records). On the next to last time the tech came out I showed him
the records and advised him that I wanted armored lines. He said he would
advise his supervisor. A week later I had my armored lines (run specialy
nearly a block to the tie-block) and the problem was resolved until my
roomie burned the house down (the phone lines survived).
You also have the option of starting a civil and criminal claim dealing with
breach of contract. Phone companies must provide phone lines that meet
minimal standards (3kHz bandwidth / -32dB S/N). If the lines don't then the
phone company is responsible for getting the lines upgraded.
I rather doubt the phone company wants you out of business, they want your
money. It is probably a local supervisor who has a limited budget and staff
and is having to set priorities according to their supervisory
responsibilities. Get it taken up a level and you might find the climate
The FCC is enacting a new regulation that will cause every phone company to
provide 100% of their service areas with ISDN (you should have received some
kind of notice last week, I did). This also sets some minimum standards as
well as to the type and quality of service the phone company must provide.

Public Utility Commission of Texas

Austin, TX  78757
Please be advised that the PUC is not responsible for enforcing the
technical standards overall, that is the FCC. It is responsible for setting
rates and resolving problems with customers on specific problems.
The letter I received from SWBT is as follows:
Dear Customer:
On November 17, 1995, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (SWBT) filed an
application (assigned Tariff Control No. 15024) concerning its ISDN-based
services, as required by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Commission)
Substantive Rule (SR) 23.69 Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). ISDN
is a digital network architecture that provides a wide variety of services,
a standard set of user-network messages, and integrated access to the
network. Access methods to the ISDN are the Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and
the Primary Rate Interface (PRI).
This application does not increase the currently approved rates or optional
ISDN based services (i.e. SWBT's DigiLine(sm), SmartTrunk(sm), SelectVideo
Plus(sm) and PLEXAR(sm) ISDN services) and their features.
SR 23.69 sets forth the requirements for the provision of optional
ISDN-based services. In accordance with SR 23.69, at a minimum, ISDN-based
services shall comply with National ISDN-1 and National ISDN-2 Standards and
be capable of providing end-to-end digital connectivity. SWBT's application
includes the offering  of ISDN with PLEXAR(sm) II Service and new features
to DigiLine(sm) and SmartTrunk(sm) Services to meet the standards required
to meet standards required by SR 23.69. Also, SBWT is proposing in this
application to eliminate the minimum station requirement for PLEXAR II(sm)
Service and the offering of occassional user plan for DigiLine(sm) Service
to future customers. In addition, SR 23.69 requires SWBT to make ISDN-based
services available to all its exchanges in Texas by July 1, 1996. SWBT is
currently offering ISDN-based services in its exchanges comprised in the
Abilene, Amarillo, Austin, Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, Lubbock
and San Antonio LATAs. In compliance with the rule, SWBT will make
ISDN-based services available in its remaining exchanges comprised in the
Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Hearne, Longview, Midland, Waco, and Wichita Falls
LATAs by July 1, 1996. SR 23.69 also establishes the effective date of this
application to be no later than July 1, 1996. The new optional ISDN-based
service and features are expected to generate first year net revenues of

Actualy, both the Pacific Coast Rocketry group and the Experimental
Spacecraft Association are working on putting the first amateur payload in
LEO. ESA wants to put a telescope with real-time downlink up as their
payload. PCR wants to put some kind of transponder up.
Under current technology a group of about 30 dedicated amateurs (with
suitable skills) could put a 25kg payload in orbit for under 1/4 million.
It would consist of surplus and amateur built equipment.
Tripolli puts out a magazine called High Performance Rocketry which you may
be able to find at your local newstand (in Austin you get it at the Central
Market Bookstop). It usually carries at least a couple of adds for material
that PCR and a couple of smaller groups are putting out to help fund their
project. I would say it will be less than 3 years before this dream occurs
unless the DOT (the people who regulate all space shots now) decides not to
give them a permit.

@_subject: Remailer chain length? 
Hi Scott,
Forwarded message:
I agree completely. If traffic analysis is going to be done on a single box
it isn't going to matter how many remailers are there.  The monitor will
simply grab them all. At this point it simply maps them thusly:
      incoming message > remailer  > .... > remailer  > outgoing
That this really maps to is obvious:
      incoming message > remailer  > outgoing
The only thing this does is increase the number of valid entries in the
field contain only a single item. As a matter of fact it makes no difference
what the headers contain unless the body is put in some kind of envelope for
final delivery. Why? Because all one has to do is look at the body of the
text which will not have changed. This leads to a simple model, based on a
physical remailer:
        1. Physical remailer receives an evelope addressed to them.
        2. They open it and find a $1 money order (for paying the remailer)
           and another envelope with another delivery address on it.
        3. Remailer puts $1 in bank and the interior letter in the mail.
To convert this to electronic means:
        1. Remailer receives a email that is encrypted except for the
           header.
        2. Remailer decrypts mail (ie removes the outer envelope) and
           find three items, block of encrypted data (ie inner envelope)
           with header to next site and e$ token for $1.
        3. Remailer sends the data on its way.
There are a couple of points to be made.
        1. No traffic is handled in the clear except for the header to
           the current destination all others are nested in encryption.
        2. Remailer chaining is handled entirely by the customer
           (ie customer addresses the envelopes)
        3. $1 is the smallest amount normaly accepted as a fee for a
           valid contract.
        4. Remailer can't look at data because there is no way to find the
           correct sequence of keys to unlock the nested encryption.
        5. Automaticaly limits spamming unless a remailer allows cloning
           AND all recipients share a commen private key.
        6. It maps 1:1 onto the physical remailer model with the same limits
           on information at each stage. This allows one to directly apply
           the current history of precedence involving anonymity and
           physical remailers.
Under todays current legal and social structure this is the only model that
will prevent remailers from being held accountable for their traffic and at
the same time provide enough income to keep legal protection at hand. Note
that I am not saying you still can't be brought brought up on charges,
simply that you (as a remailer) now have the structure in place to fight it
This is the basic model that the Austin Cypherpunks are working on at the
currrent time. The big problem we have right now is determining if the body
is actualy encrypted. We have done some basic tests of encryption-spoofing
using pgp and it is looks to be a thorny problem. It simply is not trivial
to look at a block of characters and determine if they are actualy
encrypted. You can't rely on the wrapper around the data put there by the
encryption program because this can be kept intact and the data changed. As
long as the checksum matches it all looks the same. Even if the test is done
with a dictionary  this won't help because rsa does not guarantee that once
the data is encrypted that the output would be gibberish, sort of like the
"All the monkeys in the world typing create Shakespeare" story. It is
completely feasible (though unlikely) for the encrypted text to be something
meaningful in some language or another.

Number 273  May 31, 1996    by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein
SCHRODINGER'S CAT-ION: Physicists at NIST (Christopher
Monroe, 303-497-7415) have experimentally demonstrated the
principles of the famous Schrodinger's cat thought experiment with
a single beryllium ion. In a 1935 paper, physicist Erwin
Schrodinger proposed the cat paradox: put a cat inside a box, add
a container of poison gas which is activated by the decay of a
radioactive atom, and close the box.  Since the radioactive atom
obeys the rules of quantum mechanics and since therefore its state
is indeterminate until measured by an outside observer, opening the
box and observing the atom (a microscopic quantum system)
instantly determines the status of the cat (a decidedly macroscopic,
non-quantum concept).  The feline is neither alive nor dead until the
radioactive atom is measured by an observer. Although this thought
experiment is impossible to carry out for a number of reasons,
including the fact that the quantum properties of a system tend to
wash out in an object made of many atoms and molecules such as
a cat, the NIST physicists have demonstrated the basic principles
using a single beryllium ion.  The researchers trap the ion with
nonuniform electric fields and cool it to a near standstill.  Laser
pulses then cause the ion to oscillate as a combination of
wavepackets representing two different electronic states.  Additional
laser pulses push apart the two wavepackets to separations of as
much as 80 nanometers, a mesocopic-size scale far bigger than the
normal spatial extent of the ion.  So in this version of Schrodinger's
cat, the ion's electronic state (a quantum property) is linked to (or
"entangled" with)  a mesocopic-scale position (a non-quantum
property). By applying subsequent pulses that bring together the
wavepackets, the researchers detected interference patterns which
provided evidence of the original separation.  Measurements of
Schrodinger cat's states can provide information on how quantum
properties wane with the amount of physical separation between
quantum states.  (C. Monroe et al., Science, 24 May 1996.)
SUPERCONDUCTING TUNNEL JUNCTIONS (STJ), under
development as efficient detectors of x rays, can now also be used
as single-photon detectors at visible wavelengths.  In this regard
they will be welcomed by astronomers who increasingly record
incoming light with charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays.  In
contrast to the silicon-based CCDs, which are insensitive to a
photon's energy (one photon engenders one electron in the
detector), the niobium-based STJ's do discriminate as to energy
(one photon, depending on its energy, can generate thousands of
electrons).  Determining a photon's energy would allow
astronomers to forego filters, which lower the detector's overall
efficiency.  A STJ device developed by an Oxford-Cambridge-European Space Agency (Netherlands) collaboration can detect light
in the wavelength range 200-500 nm with a spectral resolution of 45
nm (this should improve to 20 nm or better).  The STJ can also
determine the photon's time of arrival at the millisecond level, a
property the would be handy for studying fast astronomical
processes such as pulsars.  (A. Peacock et al., Nature, 9 May
PHYSICS BACHELOR'S DEGREES. Here are some highlights
from a new AIP report on 1994 degree recipients in the U.S.---the

support; women constitute 17% of the degree recipients; median
starting salary was $27,000.  (Patrick Mulvey, 301-209-3076.)

@_subject: Remailer thoughts 
Hi Adam,
Forwarded message:
Not if they are on the same box, simply treat the box itself as the
remailer. The internal mechanics are for the most part irrelevant to this
issue. N messages go in, N messages with (number of remailers)(# of cover
traffic/real message) messages of cover. My contention is that it does not
matter how many remailers are on a single box. It is the number of
connections in and out of the box available. The above equation is clearly
linear and therefore not what I would consider computationaly challenging.
If I may introduce some terminology (unless their is an existing stnd.),
x       number of messages
y       message multiplier
N    remailer number #
R    number of remailers on machine #
C()     number of cover messages/original messages
E#      number of connections on machine #
T()     total traffic through remailer system
$i()    cost per message, incoming
$o()    cost per message, outgoing
C       fixed cost items of operation (eg rent)
Note: each of these represent a family of functions.
My contention:
T(R is equivalent to T(R N2(x)..., Nn(x))) T() = R + C(yN
The term 2N represents the number of valid messages the remailer
handles. x incoming & x outgoing, hence 2x.
The total income of such a remailer:
It is important to recognize the profit dependancy on the input/output
message ratio. If it gets too high, you got nothing to spend on yourself.
Your contention (if I may translate):
N1(3x) is more secure than N1(x), assuming identical remailer configuration.
Do you consider N equivalent to aN May I inquire into your
This is a limitation of the mail-news gateway and not of the remailer
technology. What it points to is a serious shortcoming in mail-news gateway
software. The technology required for truely efficient newsgroup handling is
something sorely in need of work.
If the encryption technology is secure. The point I am making here is that
the encryption envelope is 'secure' only so long as nobody is trying to
crack it. Sooner or later somebody is going to decrypt your message, if not
the entire encryption system. This is synonymous with the physical model. The
paper envelope is secure as long as somebody isn't breaking the law by
tampering with the mail.
Ok. Let's for a moment assume that to send a message to
'president at whitehouse.gov' with 'Die Bill!' is a crime. Would it not be a
crime to foil a packet of encryption by inserting 'Die Bill!' messages in
clear text in the encryption block? To date, provided no attempt at actual
decryption is attempted, there is nothing in the standards that prevent this
other than digital signatures. And again, a specific program has to be
executed. A person might very well look at it as plaintext w/o ever running
digital signatures (or they just assume its always right). Would this also
be a crime?

THE FIRST QUANTUM COMMUNICATION USES "TRITS"
INSTEAD OF BITS.  For the first time, physicists have exploited
the laws of quantum mechanics to send data, and with their
technique have conveyed information more efficiently than with
traditional means.     In contrast to a traditional computer, in which
messages consist of tiny electric pulses encoded in binary form
(i.e., streams of 0s and 1s), researchers at the University of
Innsbruck in Austria send messages consisting of single photons
which can be coded as 0s, 1s, and 2s, setting up a base three system
called "trits."  The Innsbruck group (Harald Weinfurter,
harald.weinfurter at uibk.ac.at) converts a single ultraviolet photon
into two photons whose properties are quantum mechanically
interlinked, or "entangled."  Devices then encode a 0, 1, or 2 onto
one of the photons by performing an operation on it (such as
flipping its spin or shifting its phase); since the devices are blind to
the initial state of the photon, they change the overall properties of
the entangled photon pair without determining its final state.  The
two photons are recombined and then the interlinked pair travels
towards a network of detectors.  Two-photon interference creates
three different sets of detection possibilities in the Innsbruck setup
that reveal the quantum state of the entangled pair and whether the
photon was encoded with a  0, 1, or 2.  The physics of
entanglement has been exploited in numerous recent experiments,
to build quantum logic gates (Update 250) and perform an atom-level demonstration of Schrodinger's cat (Update 273), but until
now it has never been used for quantum communication---encoding
a message at one location and receiving it at another. Furthermore,
the same information contained in a typical ASCII character,
normally requiring the use of 8 bits, can also be transmitted using
only 5 trits.  (K. Mattle et al, Physical Review Letters, 17 June
1996.  More information and graphics can be found at
THE CLOSEST EXTRA-SOLAR PLANET yet discovered orbits
the star Lalande 21185, only 8.1 light years from Earth.  George
Gatewood of the University of Pittsburgh observed a telltale wobble
in the light coming from the star, indicating the presence of a
Jupiter-sized planet circling the star in a Saturn-sized orbit. Gatewood's data, presented at the meeting of the American
Astronomical Society in Madison, WI, even hinted at the possibility
of other planets in the same solar system. (Washington Post, 12
June.)  Also,  another planet has been found by Geoff Marcy of San
Francisco State and Paul Butler of Berkeley, who announced two
new planets in January 1996.  Their new find is a Jupiter-sized
planet orbiting the star Rho Cancri (40 light years from Earth) at a
distance of only 0.1 astronomical units.  It completes a "year" in
only about two Earth weeks.  (Sky & Telescope, July 1996)
A MOVIE OF THE CRAB NEBULA provides new details about
pulsar dynamics.  At the heart of the nebula is a pulsar (the remnant
of a 1000-year-old supernova) which casts powerful streams of
particles into the surrounding debris-filled medium.  The Hubble
Space Telescope has recorded a sequence of pictures which show
where much of the pulsar's energy goes.  One surprise was how
quickly the landscape alters: noticeable changes in the region around
the pulsar sometimes occurred in a matter of days.  A second
surprise is that the outward flow of energy is confined largely to
two zones: jets shooting out from the poles and wisps of material in
the pulsar's equatorial plane.  (Science News, 8 June; Science, 7

Hi Fred,
Forwarded message:
Not if I am allowed geometry. I believe such situations are a test of
lateral thinking more than any fundamental insite into nature.
What are you defining as random? The definition I use in practice is basicly
that if I am given 100% intelligence on a stream of numbers the odds of my
succesfully choosing the next number is never higher than chance.
All data is random (by definition) until the pattern(s) can be discerned.
In this context pseudo-random has a definite meaning, namely that it takes a
long time to amass enough information about the data stream to break the
chance boundary. The question quickly becomes, how do you test various
sequences against one another for robustness? It seems to me that it has to
be done statisticaly.
One aspect of this is what I call the 'ghost' pattern. In short, in the
process of analyzing some random data a pattern is found. Is it possible
that there could be more than one pattern (ie interpretation) of the data?
Is it possible for a data stream to contain two (or more) messages
coherently? If a message does contain two or more coherent messages, how
does this affect the size of the data? Can this occur only on messages above
a certain size?

What's inside the probe?
The heart of Mr. SQUId is a small integrated circuit containing a dc SQUID
and 2 modulation coils. The SQUID itself is a superconducting ring made of
Yttrium Barium Copper oxides (Y1Ba2Cu3O7, sometimes called YBCO or 123) with
two active devices called Josephson Junctions - the basic building block of
all superconducting electronics - made by a process invented at Conductus.
The coils are made of thin film silver deposited on top of an insulating
layer. The chip in Mr. SQUID represents a remarkable level of sophistication
in a materials technology scarecly 5 years old. And, unlike any other SQUID
system currently on the market, Mr. SQUID is designed to operate in a liquid
Nitrogen bath at 77K (-169C).
What does Mr. SQUID do?
Mr. Squid is a sensitive superconducting magnetometer and can therefore be
used to detect small magnetic signals if they are properly introduced to the
SQUID. The limiting performance of Mr. SQUID is set by its economical
electronics package and by its non-superconducting modulation coils. As a
result, Mr. SQUID does not have the sensitivity of high-performance
laboratory SQUIDs and thus cannot be used to detect truly minute signals
such as those generated in the human brain.

Not. Not only woud SQUID technology be applicable but STM and MNR
technologies would also be applicable to this type of hardware analysis. The
chip is simply to big to prevent this type of analysis. Get it down to
atomic scale (nanotech) and SQUIDs are about your only resource.

neuronal activity of the human brain on a neuron by neuron basis. The folks
who make the various flavors of super-conducting wire use them to test for
imperfections in the product. I sugest that your familiarity with the SQUID
technology might be a little dated. Take the time to contact Conductus.
I didn't make that assertion. I clearly offered it as a source of education

@_subject: Remailers & what they get out of it... 
Forwarded message:
As long as the remailer is run a 'grins & giggles' affair you are right.
The moment they are run as a business enterprise then the game changes.
Several of the Austin Cypherpunks and myself have set up a remailer here
in Austin (kourier.ssz.com) using MixMaster. The intent is that once we get
out of testing the software and other mods we are in the middle of we will
have a commercialy viable service. I am currently discussing with a couple
of local lawyers possible strategies we can employ if CoS or others start
legal motions. The idea that we are exploring is a defence by offence. One
aspect is 'work in progress' protection of both our development mods as well
as our customers work. I also hope to build part of the defence on the fact
that to bring the remailer down denies access to the public key-server which
is integrated into the remailer as a value-added service.
(NOTE: don't waste your time trying to get to kourier over the next few
       weeks. A more public announcement is in the works)
To me the biggest problem with the crypto work right now is that not enough
professionals are involved. If more remailers and such were initiated as a business there would be legal avenues to explore. Also, in this vain is
the apparent lack of support for commercial ventures by developers of such
apps as MixMaster (whose license explicity prohibits commercial use).
And for the record, yes, we expect to charge real $$$ for access. Our
current plan is $10/month for each account. Money orders prefered. We have
at this point pondered e-cash methods but it doesn't seem popular enough
at this juncture.
I agree with (a) completely. The way to make a remailer profitable is to
charge for access. As to (b), step one is get a lawyer on board from the get
go. One aspect of (b) is that it should be no more illegal for me to allow
my users to post to usenet anonymously via my guest account than to do it
via a remailer. In fact, one could argue that if anonymous remailers are
truly illegal then so are 'guest' or other demo accounts on systems that
don't get personal info (and verified at that) prior to accessing any system
services. This means that systems such as l0pht.com or ssz.com are illegal
to operate.

@_subject: Remailer extensions 
Hi all,
In pondering the last few days of discussion it occurs to me that a test
might be possible. In short:
Is it legal for a business to anonymously remail physical mail?
The process I propose is as follows:
1.   Some party mails an envelope to 'Remailers-R-Us'.
2.   Inside that envelope is the real mail addressed and stamped along
     with say a $1 money order for processing.
3.   The people at Remailers-R-Us simply take the dollar and deposit it
     in the bank while depositing the letter they received in the local
     mail drop.
Now the Remailers-R-Us obviously can't open the mail since that would be
tampering. To this end I make reference to some comments I made about a year
ago regarding the results of encrypting every stage of the remailer
sequence. To wit, the only way to guarantee protection is if the remialer
is not able to read the actual contents of the mail, even if they were so
I would also like to point out (the obvious I admit) that the founding
fathers apparently embarced anonymous distribution via their 'publius'
handle. It seems to me that a federal prosecutor would have a hard time
claiming there was no precedence for such actions. Such a claim to my way
of thinking would be fundamental in any attempted prosecution for anonymous
remailing. Also, as far as I can find out, there was no persecution of the
newspapers for printing this material anonymously, they apparently were not
held to task for the content. This seems to indicate that English commen law
of that day (and its descendants here today) embraced anonymous speech as

@_subject: PILATE SAYETH UNTO HIM... (fwd) 
Hiya Sandy,
Forwarded message:
If there was an absolute Truth as you postulate the results would be many and varied. For instance,
1.  If the Truth were absolute everyone would have to accept it as such
    even if they disagreed or said it wasn't the Truth, In essence it
    would at the same time create the ultimate Lie. This leads to a logic
    inconsistancy, something can't be the ultimate Truth and at the same
    be the ultimate Lie AND and claim no relativity applies. If you allow
    relativity into your argument then it is clear that the subject of
    study is not an ultimate anything.
2.  What is the litmus test for ultimate Truth? How do you tell it from
    regular truth? How do you tell it from a lie? From the Lie?
3.  If there were a ultimate Truth then this implies that it is possible
    to have a system which can fully describe itself. Godel's Incompletenes
    Theorem would be found invalid, which by extension would have some wide
    spread ramifications for the rest of our knowledge base.
4.  An ultimate Truth would philosphicaly be inseperable from God. Being
    a pantheist, you are going to have a hard time floating that boat in my
    pond.
5.  An ultimate truth would imply that all existance conformed or was aware
    of the ultimate Truth. In essence you are claiming that truth and
    falsity (good/bad) exist as a absolute and not a consequence of human
    psychology. I would be very interested in your reasoning regarding how
    a rock on the other side of the Magellanic Clouds could be effected by
    a ultimate Truth.
6.  I suspect that any ultimate Truth would have to be so trival it would
    be useless. Tautologies are worthless for proving anything.
7.  On the issue of postulates (ie unprovable assumptions necessary for
    the creation of a logical framework - Godel rears its ugly head again)
    the implication is that we can now prove Euclids 5 postulates
    absolutely. I am shure many mathematicians would be interested in this.
Which reality? Yourse, mine, a photons? To a photon the entire universe
is the photon. Would your Truth be true for it? It is obvious that its
truth's are not valid for us (unless you are claiming we are all everywhere
at once). If there is no one absolute Reality how can there be a absolute
I understand it quite well. Why are you having so hard a time giving me
a straight answer?
If you admit fallibility then how can one claim to recognize a ultimate
anything, let along Truth? Hardly a left field question as you claim.
It doesn't qualify as ad hominem because it was not directed at a
personality but rather at your basic theoretical assumptions. It is completely
valid (and necessary I might) to both question basic postulates
(otherwise non-Euclidian geometry would not have existed) as well as to
clearly elucidate what those postulates are. You did not do that, I simply
asked for clarification. I have never made a attack on personality as a
basis for any of my discussion on this list. I have made some comments to folks about�the way they treated others, but this is clearly different than a
discourse on a technical issue. At no point have I implied covertly or
otherwise any statement about anybody on this lists intelligence or ability
to reason being a reflection of their basic worth as a human being. I accept
you each as being basicly worthy of respect for no other reason than you
simply exist. Whether a particular individual was right, wrong, or simply
holds a radicly different view than myself is not sufficient reason for me
or anyone else to judge anothers worth. An ad hominem is the embodyment of
measuring a persons intrinsic worth by their ability to argue or hold an
opinion (or spell). To my way of thinking, if the only bitch you have about
a argument is whether it was spelled correctly each time, you don't have
much to say worth listening to.
My responce does not qualify as a straw man argument because I am discussing
your original claims, not drawing an analogy and claiming equivalence. You
were drawing  an analogy and claiming equivalence. I have asked several
times if you would accept or believe other situations to be similar, hardly
the same as a straw man since you did not ask if others thought they were
equivalent but simply stated it as such.
To the point, I don't care where the theory came from (ever), I simply want
to know if it works. If I had my way the discussion on this list would never
have a personality attached to it, complete anonymity.

@_subject: Truth is equivalent to law? 
Hi blanc,
Forwarded message:
What is the 'general nature of truth'?
So in your mind truth is equivalent to law? In the sense of the above quote
the 'laws' that are refered to are general observed regularities that we
are capable of understanding. Being a pantheist and hence seeing the entire
cosmos as all there is (and hence divine in toto), I can appreciate the
original intent (being a physicist helps a little bit).
If I accept your equivalency (which I do) then there is no such thing as
Truth in the sense of the original discussion. The laws refered to in the
quote have the implicit characteristic of being disproved. A characteristic
not shared by Truth.
I further believe the universe is understandable, just not in toto. It is a
little simplistic to believe that every system in the cosmos uses all the
regularities that we observe. When followed to its logical conclusion  it
implies that there may (are) systems which we won't be able to understand
in toto (quantum effects come to mind) simply because the system that is
our brain either is not complex enough or runs into the Godel paradox.
In short, if we assume that we can understand the universe in toto then we
have in effect demonstrated that Godel was incorrect. I have covered the
ramifications of this previously.
Crypto relevancy: many assumptions that we take for granted are based upon
                  proof and 'laws' we ASSUME to be isotropic and                   homogeneous. If we don't have a clear and present
                  understanding of the 'laws', the procedures used to obtain
                  them, and the limitations  of both our 'laws' and the                   procedures, then we are opening ourselves up for a large
                  dose of security by obscurity.
Always question authority, it is simply another human being who does not have your best interest at heart since they have their own agenda.

Why is this so surprising? We are nothing more than a manifistation of those

There is no absolute truth. As I have stated before when this issue has

Forwarded message:
If this is strictly true, why not simply run several instances of a remailer
on the same machine. Then randomly chain them prior to sending them off
site. This would be a lot cheaper and faster than trying to convince
hobbyist to set it up or businesses to to use their profit & legal council.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 294  November 6, 1996    by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
NANOSCALE ABACUS.  Scientists at IBM Zurich have used a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) probe to reposition C-60
molecules on a copper substrate, making in effect the first room-
temperature device capable of storing and manipulating numbers
at the single molecule level.  The buckyballs (which are big,
sturdy molecules) act as the counters of a tiny abacus in which
low (indeed mono-atomic) terraces in the copper surface
constrain the buckyballs to move accurately in a straight line.
(The abacus is perhaps the first human calculating device, and the
Greek word means "sand on a board.")  IBM researcher James
Gimzewski (gim at zurich.ibm.com) admits that his device is
slow: "The tool we use (the STM probe) is the equivalent of
operating a normal abacus with the Eiffel Tower."  But things
should improve in coming years; with this new advance,
hundreds of buckyball ranks could fit neatly inside the same
linewidth that characterizes features on a Pentium processor chip. As for speed, engineers expect to fabricate arrays of hundreds
and even thousands of STM probes for simultaneously imaging
(and repositioning) many atoms and molecules.  (M.T. Cuberes
et al., to appear in the 11 November issue of Applied Physics
Letters; an associated figure can be obtained on the Web at
THE SHORTEST X-RAY PULSES yet produced have been
made at LBL by shooting 100-femtosecond bursts of infrared
laser light at right angles into a beam of electrons.  Some of the
photons are converted into x rays by scattering (through 90
degrees) into the same direction as the electrons.  The resultant
x-ray bursts are themselves short---about 300 fsec---and potent,
with an energy of 30 keV (or, equivalently, a wavelength of 0.4
angstroms).  By narrowing the electron beam further (currently it
is a mere 90 microns wide), even sharper x-ray pulses (50 fsec)
are in the offing.  Theses pulses are ideal probes---their small
wavelength permits studies of atomic structure with high
resolution.  Meanwhile their short duration make them an
excellent strobe light for glimpsing ultrafast phenomena. For
example, the LBL researchers are using the x-ray pulses to study
the melting of silicon.  (R.W. Schoenlein et al., Science, 11
October 1996.)
PHOTONIC CRYSTALS NOW OPERATE IN THE NEAR
INFRARED.  These structures are to optics what semiconductors
are to electronics: they allow the passage of light at some
wavelengths but exclude light in certain other energy ranges (also
called photon bandgaps).  Since the first photonic crystals
(operating at microwave wavelengths) were developed several
years ago, researchers have attempted to move toward the visible,
where potential technological applications beckon.  Scientists at
the University of Glasgow and the University of Durham have
now constructed a tiny wafer riddled with 100-micron holes
which exhibits the lowest-wavelength photonic bandgap yet: 800-
900 nm.  (Thomas F. Krauss et al., Nature, 24 October 1996.)

Exactly. Because the list takes in submissions from ALL parties and then
resubmits them to ALL SUBSCRIBED parties it qualifies as a publisher. The real issue here is that folks on the net want the protection of the 1st
Amendment but they don't want the responsibility that goes along with it.
This list qualifies as a press. As a result it has a responsibility relating
to what it distributes.
Vulis was unpopular he was not distruptive. At NO time did he interfere with
the normal operation of the list software or prevent submissions or
We need fewer lawyers and better laws. Most pseudo-law is practiced by lawyers.

I run several lists and have for quite a few years. In that time I have
never censored any member. I have had similar instances as to Vulis and my
responce has been and will continue to be.
"This is your problem, I have no authority to prohibit membership or
submissions of members of the list. If you wish to not see such submissions
from some party then it is your responsibility to deal with it. In short,
either unsubscribe or filter."
I never said any such thing. Please quit attributing comments to me which
are untrue.
The fact that it is 'private property' is irrelevant to this issue. Most
'presses' are private property. Trying to change the subject won't work.
As to making it clear at subscription time what the actual operating rules
are is my EXACT point. In fact you are agreeing with my position.
At the current time there are no indications at log on that this list is
considered private property, that the operator reserves the right to edit or
refuse submissions, etc. which is what makes it a 'public' list and what
makes him legaly liable for the cencorship he has enacted without warning.
I have been on this list for several years and at no point in that time have
I agreed to anything which gives the operator of the list my permission to
modify or refuse my original submissions. If he or a third party wishes to
refer to them in part or in toto in their own submissions is fine. That is
the whole point of the list.

Forwarded message:
And why wouldn't you? Let's look at this a moment.
1.   Business, irrespective of size, is not equivalent to the government
     and specificaly isn't mentioned in the Constitution at all so we
     are reasonably safe they are exempt from federal compliance with its
     requirements outside that detailed for citizens and regarding
     inter-state or international trade.
2.   The relationship between employer and employee is one based on a
     contract.
3.   Neither party is forced beyond their own needs and desires to sign
     the contract.
4.   Each party is aware of the contents of the contract before they
     sign it, or at least is given the opportunity to be made aware.
     If somebody wants to sign a contract with no knowledge of its
     contents, so be it.
5.   Who owns the computers? The business does clearly. Now a commen
     proviso on ownership is that the final decision, or the transfer
     of that decision, is up to the business. Just as it is ultimately
     up to you who gets to drive your car.
6.   Most provisions of employment contain the proviso that the time
     you agree to work for that employer is to be spent on dealing with
     the employers needs and not the employees. This is after all at least
     one of the reasons behind using time off and floating holidays and
     such.
7.   Provided the employee is aware of this policy at the time of
     signing OR is given a reasonable warning period before a shift of
     policy after hiring then the employee has no grounds to complain.
Myself, I always ask my immediate supervisor for a description of company
policy on this. I also always ask if they have an objection to me using
the company system to log into my home system during lunch and other
'off-clock' hours. So far I have never been refused.
Short answer to this, use your own resources for your own use and don't
use other peoples resources to carry on your own activities unless you offer
them a cut of the profit.
Ultimately this isn't even a question of contracts but of simple plain ol'
every-day manners.

                    SPAMMING LEADS TO UUNET 'DEATH PENALTY'
      Spam graphic August 4, 1997
     Web posted at: 9:34 p.m. EDT (0134 GMT)
     SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) -- A loose coalition of system administrators
     Friday began issuing a "Usenet Death Penalty" against UUNET, a major
     Internet service provider, for its alleged failure to curb "spam"
     emanating from its dialup accounts.
     The penalty took effect 5 p.m. (PDT) Friday, and according to a
     release from the coalition, "all traffic coming from these sources
     is to be canceled until further notice."
     The penalty entails the use of a program called a cancelbot that
     travels from site to site, looking for newsgroup messages that
     originate from a particular person or ISP. When it finds one of the
     messages, it issues a cancel order, which effectively erases the
     message.
     Spamming is the bulk delivery of unwanted electronic messages via
     e-mail or newsgroups.
     The action marks the first time a large-scale ISP has been the
     target of a cancelbot. The penalty's purpose, said Dennis
     McClain-Furmansky, is to "mobilize the user base and get them to
     insist on their ISP to give them a clean feed. Right now they are
     paying $20 a month for trash."
     McClain-Furmansky, speaking on behalf of the Usenet death penalty
     issuers, explains that, unlike other ISPs such as EarthLink and Bell
     Atlantic, UUNET has done little or nothing to curb spammers using
     its service. "The few responses they've made to our complaints have
     been excuses," he said.
     After Bell Atlantic was informed by site administrators several
     weeks ago that it had been targeted for the Usenet death penalty,
     the service took immediate action to halt spam, McClain-Furmansky
     said. "We told them what was being planned, and they are making a
     clear effort."
     McClain-Furmansky said that the action was drastic, but it was a
     last resort to close off a flood of spam that was "knocking servers
     offline." On Friday, one of the administrators involved said his
     system processed 1 million messages for the first time ever. Forty
     percent of that was spam, 40 percent cancel messages, 20 percent
     legitimate traffic." About half the cancel messages issued are for
     spam originating from UUNET dialups, said McClain-Furmansky.
     "In my opinion, this is by far the worst censorship action the Net
     has seen to date," said Dave Hayes, who represents a group called
     the Freedom Knights, dedicated to "true free speech" on Usenet.
     Hayes said those pushing the death decree should be "summarily
     condemned by all those who are in support of free speech, which
     unfortunately includes unsolicited advertising."
     Brian Moore, a system administrator in Britain who oversees the
     Usenet feed for his site, said he is not surprised that the action
     was taken against UUNET. "Amongst the 50-some complaints I have sent
     them in the past week, I have received nothing but form letters
     back. The spamming customers continue spamming and there is no
     indication UUNET has acted in any way at all."
     Moore said he has canceled hundreds of porn spams appearing in
     alt.sexual.abuse.recovery. "Quite frankly, UUNET is irresponsible in
     their inability to control their own customers," he said.
     UUNET declined comment Friday.

The Many Worlds Hypothesis was developed by David Bohm and is an alternate
way of looking at the Uncertaintly Principle, which gets its origin from the
collapse of wave functions used to describe the potential states of a wave.
The advantage of using a Many Worlds Hypothesis is that it allows you to do
away with Bohms, Schroedinger, Einstein, etc. objections to the standard
model, God playing with dice.
Hamiltonian of the wave equation. In short the Many World theory says that
all possible outcomes are available in parallel, you only get to experience
one of them. The standard model says the Hamiltonian collapses from its
n-element state to a single valued state at the time of measurement (ie the
system is in no state unless measured). Which was Schroedingers explicit
complaint, in his cat model the question he was asking (that gets dropped
by modern physicist because it is so subversive to the Standard Model) is
"Doesn't the cat know what state it is in?". The implicit (and never stated)
assumption in the Standard Model is that a particle's state is defined by
the particles and their interactions that surround it AND the particle is
comletely unaware of it. Which brings questions like "How does the electron
know to be in the S1 orbital if it doesn't have any way of knowing its
energy state?". This is especialy problematic since a base assumption is
that the only way to effect an electron is through a photon. A good extension
is consider the insanity of the Moon disappearing when you aren't looking
at it. Look at the Moon and the tides appear, look away from the Moon and
the tides go away...
You can't combine them, the whole point of the Many Worlds theory is to
explicity eliminate quantum probability and bring the mechanism into the deterministic model used at higher levels of scale (ie Newtonian Mechanics).
The goal is to build a system that is consistent across questions of scale.
Sounds like a bunch of wishfull thinking and serious misunderstanding of
Bohm, Schroedinger, etc.'s work.

Malarky, the country was founded on the belief in a God not a Christian god,
considering that Washington and Jefferson were not even Christians pretty
much blows that whole Christian promulgated lie.
Washington and Jefferson were deist.
At no point does the Constitution ever mention Christ.
Typical Christian attitude, preach but don't worry about practicing it.
And just in case you haven't got the clue yet, I will spell it out. There
are MANY groups who believe in a God. Very few of them believe Christ was
the son of God and our saviour.
I am a Pantheist, I believe in god but I can guarantee it bears absolutely
no resemblance to the Christian god. This realization was the whole point of
seperation of church and state and my god given right to practice my beliefs
even if they aren't rights given by YOUR god.

soldier who fires on Americans is clearly going against prima facia evidence
that the framers intended for American military force to NEVER be used

So should his commanders all the way to ole Billary.

With all due respect, bullshit. Fecundity is in no way related to long-term
survival as detailed in the various theories of Neo-Darwinian evolution or
in actual studies. I would suggest strongly that you read Ernst Meyr and get
a better grip on how evolutionary theory works. Just being fecund does not
in any way guarantee success, in fact it may guarantee failure because it
keeps the limits of genetic spread of the population constrained. There is
also a book, Extinction: luck or genes?, which you should look into.
I apologize for not providing better cites but I don't have any of Mayr's or
the extinction book on hand at the moment. They are commenly found in the
science section of larger bookstores though.
Also note that Mayr has a new book out (about a year old I believe) that
covers some of the most recent changes of the punctuated-equilibria and
neo-darminian camps.

Yes, Lucky you did.
Go read the 10th. The state is NOT (I say again, NOT) allowed to
do anything not expressly allowed because the Constitution is a clear
refutation of this sort of thinking.
On one hand you rail against the oppression of people by their government and
then you promote even further oppression, what a hypocrite. Your eugenic
slant on democracy is a disservice.
In case you haven't caught the clue, people don't belong to the government.

Contracts between private individuals are not constrained by the
Constitution so your allegory is flawed. What the government can and can't
do as a result of its charter to represent all the people has nothing to do
with what two individuals arrange between themselves on a consensual basis
involving a contract.

Actualy this premise is false. The results of evolution stand out more in
smaller populations because a given change can propogate through the
population with less chance of being swammped by other changes that are
also propogating through that population. There is also the fact that the
vast majority of changes are either harmless or else debilitating further
slowing the genetic drift.
Look at it this way. If we have 1000 mating pairs and one of those pairs
progeny has a genetic change it is much easier for that change to get
propogated because the odds of the offspring mating with the other 999 pairs
offspring are much higher than if there were say 10,000 pairs. The number of
generations required for that change to become ubiquitous in small
populations is much lower than in larger populations.
The genetic drift for a given species is usualy low because of this
dillution whereas if a punctuating event occurs it will lower the available
pool of mates and hence the relative changes increase until the new
population becomes stable, usualy because the mitigating effects of the
punctuating event have receded.
If you would like a concrete case to study, review the research about
genetic drift in monkey populations in the Great Rift Valley in Africa.

This I agree with completely. At no point in the Constitution does it give
the federal government the job of welfare. It also does not provide for any
mechanism for law enforcement (ie DEA, NSA, FBI, etc.) outside of taxes and
inter-state commerce.

Militia <> Army.
Exactly, they were militia NOT federal troops. This is EXACTLY why we have
the militia mentioned in the 2nd. With there being no mechanism to
constitutionaly employ federal troops against Americans there had to be some
means to maintane the peace. In addition there needed to be some mechanism
to prevent the federals from mis-using those troops hence the 2-year limit
at the federal level for all monies expended on federal troops. No such
limit applies to monies given to the states to fund their individual
militias. Which are LOANED to the federal government with the consent of the
govenor of the particular states. The idea being that if the fed's mis-use
those troops the govenor simply orders them to stand down. Without voluntary
help from the states the feds should be powerless inside the borders of the

Near as I can tell Washington acted responsibly within the bounds of the

                    JUDGE DISMISSES WOMAN'S DISNEYLAND SUIT
      Disney lawsuit August 22, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:44 p.m. EDT (0244 GMT)
     LOS ANGELES, (Reuter) -- A judge on Friday dismissed asuit brought
     against Disneyland by a woman who said she wasrobbed at the theme
     park and her grandchildren were traumatized by seeing Disney
     characters remove their costumes.
     The lawsuit was brought by Billie Jean Matay, 57, who wasone of the
     first group of Mouseketeers, young Disneyentertainers dressed in
     costumes that included Mickey Mouse ears, to perform at Disneyland
     when it opened 40 years ago.
     Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard Luesenbrink said,"There
     is nothing to suggest this incident could have beenavoided."
     The dismissal came after Matay's lawyer had rested his case.
     Matay, who broke down on the witness stand when shetestified, blamed
     poor security at the park's parking lot for her being robbed of $165
     at gunpoint in August 1995 when she went there with her three
     grandsons, aged between 5 and 10.
     She said that after the incident, security guards detainedher family
     and her grandsons were shocked and traumatized when they saw Disney
     characters they believed were real take off their costumes in a back
     stage area.

   Reuters
   22-AUG-97
   CAMDEN, N.J. (Reuter) - An Ohio man was sentenced Friday to five years
   in a federal prison for using the Internet to induce a 12-year-old New
   Jersey girl to make sexually charged videos of herself and send them
   to him.
   Paul Brown Jr., 47, of Cleveland Heights, was arrested in February
   after the West Caldwell girl's parents discovered some Internet
   communications. Brown had posed as a teen-ager in responding to the
   girl's Internet request for an e-mail pal.
   A statement from the girl, now 14, was read in court. She accused
   Brown of ``emotional rape'' and said her life ``has been a disaster''
   since she learned the truth about him.
   Brown was convicted on morals and pornography charges. His crimes were
   considered federal offenses because of their interstate nature.

No, I would say that I at least am not in agreement.
The US Constitution doesn't allow the states anything, it DOES delineate the
duties of the federal government.
The federal government does not own the states any more than it owns the
citizens. In other words, the states don't need the federal governments
permission to carry on their day to day activities within their boundaries.
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. The problem I see with your thinking is one of heirarchy which is not what
the Constitution is about, it is about how to carry on the business of
running a democratic government that involves equals with clearly dilineated
duties for the systems and rights whose expression is outside the domain
of the systems that are the peoples exclusivly. Governments don't have rights
they have duties which they are charged with carrying out according to
their charter.
People need to understand the original intent was for the state and federal
governments to be on equal footing when it comes to checks & balances. The
biggest disservice we do is thinking the 3 parts of the federal government
are all that is involved in the checks & balances. The states should always
have the opportunity to tell the feds, thanks but no thanks, within the
bounds of the state and federal constitutions.
Democracy as embodied in our Constitution is about the relationships between

It was McArthur and the way it was carried out is completely constitutional.
I will first include the relevant section of the Constitution:
such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of Government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;  Notice in the first sentence it gives Congress the power of 'exclusive
Legislation in all Cases whatsoever'. What this means is that within the
District of Columbia the Congress and NOT the Constitution is the supreme
law and they do NOT have any responsibility to abide by the Constitution
either in spirit or act.
If you want to have a demonstration AND you want Constitutional protection
don't do it within that 10 square miles...
I believe strongly that the founders did not intend anyone to actualy live
within the 10 square miles set aside for such business. It was intended to
be used exclusively for the physical local of the various agencies and no

They mean it isn't something the federal government has any interest or say
in constitutionaly. It does not imply that those powers are granted at the
behest of the feds but rather clearly fall outside of their jurisdiction.
Nor does it support the concept of a heirarchy with the feds at the top,
then the states, and finaly the people.

It isn't the uniform, its the paycheck and who gives the orders that
determines the difference. Militia's get their money and their orders from
the states and are loaned to the federal government.
The relevant sections from the Constitution:
Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; [Note that there is NO proviso for paying for the militia's]
the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; [This seems to imply that it is not the Army who is charged with protecting
the soil of America from foreign invaders]
and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the authority of training and Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; [Hey, I just realized that the above section forces the federal government
to provide militia's with weapons, 'arming']
free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. Your chances of being shot in Texas, like the kid in the valley, are much
lower with the NJNG than the US Army, mainly because there ain't no way they
are going to get into this state without a fight with the TxNG. I seriously
doubt that the kid would be dead today if he had encountered Texas residents
on boarder patrol.
Yes, they are. Read the 10th. Unless explicity given a duty the federal
government is prohibited from expanding their powers.
The prohibition is not on a standing army but rather on monetary and
contractual committments that extend past the Constitutionaly imposed 2
year limit. There is *NO* explicit prohibition on a standing army, simply
that their activities can't be funded for more than 2 years at a time.
As far as I have been able to determine nobody has ever brought such a case.

If permitted by the California Constituion absolutely. It's called freedom
of expression, a weird sort of extension to the pursuit of life, liberty,
and happiness. If the citizens don't like it they can elect another
representative to change the law next time around. The right to liberty
implies the right to give it away.
For a democracy to work the group of people making the laws must be
relatively small, otherwise we see the sorts of abuses we currently have
because we have lost respect for others (ie another state) to decide their
fate indipendant of our own.
I am not an advocate of federal or state rights, and most definitely NOT
any sort of Libertarian. I am a strict Constitutionalist and believe that
if the federal government wants to take on a new job not explicity assigned
in the Constitition they MUST pass an amendment per the method detailed in
the Constitution.
Prior to the 14th (which only forces privileges and immunities, and I
utterly reject any claim that a right is a privilege) this was exactly the
case. The founding fathers wanted to see a multiplicity of states with a
variety of laws some limited some actions and others not. The idea behind
this is that if a state passes laws that are too restrictive it is possible
to reverse the insult in a reasonable time and if it proves impossible to
change it (say because of massive public support) then they can move to a
state where such activity is allowed, thus robbing the state of the taxes
and other benefits it derives from such residents. The idea is that if the
states are given a level of equality with the federal government there will
be a moderating effect on tryanny at all levels.
Read the 10th. The 2nd. does NOT limit a states right to regulate such

Which is why we implimented a representative democracy in the first place.
It does? You are without a doubt reading a different Constitution and Bill of
Rights than the one that I have. If you are making allusion to the 14th,
it only extends to privileges and immunities.
Section 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Section 2 to Section 5 deleted
So you equate your right to religion as a immunity or a privilige? Me
I take it as a right, something outside the legal purvue of the federal
government. An immunity or privilige is something that can be taken away by
the body granting it. Since the Constitution is a mandate from the people
it follows clearly that the only body that can change that mandate is the
people. If the state I live in has a constitution that allows it that is
between me and my state and none of you or your states or the federal
governments business.

No, I am making no such assumption the Constitution however does. Quite
clearly I might add.
Which is completely irrelevant since the federal government has no authority
over intra-state disagreements that do not involve some resource that lies

I quote from the Constitution again...
Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; -- to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; -- to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; -- to Controversies between two or more States; -- between a State and Citizens of another State; -- between Citizens of different States; -- between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States; -- and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. Section 1.  Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. Section 2.  The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Section 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Section 2 through 5 deleted . Would you be so kind as to explain exactly what the 14th brings to the table
that was not already covered in the original document? We didn't need the
14th and still don't. It was, and still is, a political ploy to get people
to willingly (through ignorance) comply with a bunch of schills.

[Note: this document puts to rest forever the question of how our government
       gets its authority and exactly who answers to who and in the first
       two paragraphs even.]
When in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.      We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such Principles and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of Abuses and Ursurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.      He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.      He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.      He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.      He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.      He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasion on the rights of the people.      He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise, the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.      He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.      He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.      He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.      He has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harrass our People, and eat o5Ubstance.      He has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures.      He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.      He has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:      For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:      For protection them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:      For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:      For depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:      For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:      For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rule into these Colonies:      For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:      For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.      He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.     He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.      He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidity scarcely paralled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy (of) the Head of a civilized nation.      He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.      He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.      In every stage of these Suppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.      Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren.  We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.  We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.      WE, THEREFORE, The Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliance, establish commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

You're the one trying a straw-man, I was simply asking a question based upon
several comments you have made both in this exchange and in others as well.
It had nothing to do with your original question but rather an attempt on my
part to expand the discussion to include the 14th which it must to be whole.
Or is your view that you are the only party who may bring other issues into
this discussion? Because, my personal opinion is that I don't need your
permission to include other issues in the argument as long as I feel they
are relevant and can justify them.
Not really as it clearly states in the first clauses where that authority
comes from and the 10th clearly puts limits on what expansions the courts
and legislature can do with the Constitution. The last clause also clearly
states that the constitutions and laws of any state are not superior (but
does not deny equality as granted in the 10th) to the laws and treaties of
the federal government. The last clause also provides even less reason for
the 14th.

If that was what he had it would truly be great, unfortunately we don't have
that. What we DO have is the feds and the state governments doing everything
they can to get around limitations such as this. In effect we have exactly
the opposite of your supposition.
The fed's are currently deciding on just exactly how federal employees can
express their religous beliefs. Do you really think the founding fathers
were so stupid that they wouldn't have thought of this if their intent
was to truly prevent any government from enacting such laws?
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. If you really believe what you state above I have a few of questions:
[well actualy I have a lot of questions, but it would be pressing the
 point I suspect]
 *  How does the federal government justify their limitations on the
    Native American Church or the Coptic Church when federal laws
    relating to religion are clearly prohibited?
 *  If we truly have freedom of speech and the fed's respect that,
    just exactly who passed the CDA?
 *  If we truly have freedom of speech and the fed's respect that,
    why is the fight for strong encryption being fought so hard?
 *  If we truly have freedom of press AND the feds are the only agency
    per the Constitutio to regulate inter-state commerce then how can
    one state arrest citizens of another state when the 'crime' in
    state of the accussed isn't a crime?
 *  Why has the federal government NEVER passed a law detailing the
    process we may use to petition the government for greivences? It
    clearly is not meant as a reference to the courts.

Unfortunately neither does the 14th respect any right, only immunities
and privileges (which clearly are not rights since they can both be
revoked by the granting agency) but it doesn't work because it allows
the feds to intrude in areas they were not meant to be involved in.
The original Constitution already had a clause applying the Constitution
and all laws derived from it to the states and preventing judges or other
agencies from bypassing them. So, given that such extensions were already
in place just what does the 14th do?

* From the original Constitution:
Section 1.  Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. Section 2.  The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. Section 4.  The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence. be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. * The 14th:
Section 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Sections 2-5 deleted
* Now please be so kind as to explain the following:
-  Where in the 14th does it mention the Bill of Rights or apply them
   to the states in such a manner that is not done in the original
   Constitution?
-  Why does the last section of the last item prior to my quote of the
   14th not apply said Bill of Rights since it is clearly a part of the
   Constitution and worded much stronger than the 14th?
-  Why does section 2 above not apply considering it is copied practicaly
   word for word in the 14th and clearly equates the states under federal
   law? Especialy since the wording of section 2 is much stronger than
   the wording of the 14th?
-  Section 4 above clearly equates the states and a citizens expectation
   of equal protection under the law, how does the 14th extend this?
-  Section 1 does something even stronger than 'equal protection' as it
   forces recognition and support of each states laws by the other states
   even if a given state makes a law that makes an action in one state
   a crime in another, how does the 14th add anything to this?
-  Is your claim that the rulings of the SCt apply to citizens instead
   of being the final arbiter for government agencies? If so, how can
   this be considering that the SCt can't instigate any legal actions
   on its own but must act in a reactive manner?
-  And finaly, why should we as citizens accept the rulings of the SCt
   as the final word since we and not the federal government are the
   ones granting the power to govern? Add to this that Constitutionaly
   the role of the SCt is to limit Congress and not the citizenry.

              REPORT: U.S. TO PAY HOSPITALS NOT TO TRAIN DOCTORS
      Doctor graphic August 24, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:22 a.m. EDT (1422 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In an effort to reduce a glut of physicians in
     the United States, the federal government will pay training
     hospitals hundreds of millions of dollars not to train doctors, The
     Washington Post reported Sunday.
     The initiative, part of the new federal budget agreement, also for
     the first time essentially forbids hospitals from increasing the
     size of their residency programs, the paper reported.
     Medicare underwrites residency training programs heavily. Taxpayers
     spend $7 billion a year on the training, with each resident
     translating into an average subsidy of $100,000 a year.IN CONTEXT
     Medicare spends up to $7 billion a year on physician training
     programs. But with one physician for every 380 people in the United
     States, critics say the government is paying for more doctors than
     it needs.
     Under the new plan, Medicare will instead pay hospitals to shrink
     their residency programs. Hospitals that voluntarily reduce
     residency training programs by 20 to 25 percent over five years will
     get the full amount of the lost subsidies for the first two years,
     with payments tapering off over the next three years, the newspaper
     said.
     After five years, the payments will cease, leaving the program with
     fewer residents to underwrite. Administration health officials and
     leading Republicans say the program will save Medicare money in the
     long run, the Post reported.
     The payments are the government's first effort to constrict the
     pipeline of people entering the medical profession, and one of the
     few times the federal government has used subsidies as leverage to
     shrink a particular work force.
  New York tried program first
     The program mirrors an experimental program in New York endorsed by
     the Clinton administration earlier this year.
     Under the agreement between the Greater New York Hospital
     Association and the federal Health Care Financing Administration,
     which runs Medicare, New York is to receive $400 million over
     several years to train fewer doctors, especially in those in certain
     specialties.
     Of the state's 75 teaching hospitals, the Post reported, 42 signed
     up for the program -- nearly four times as many as expected.
     But the agreement drew fire from teaching hospitals in other areas
     of the country who were cutting their residency rolls voluntarily
     and absorbing the cost of the lost subsidies without federal
     assistance.
  Some say agreement may have been unnecessary
     Some government officials quoted by the Post said the glut of
     doctors, particularly specialists, in the United States was a
     growing problem, and argued that the budget agreement was a valuable
     cost-cutting tool. "It remains a voluntary matter of choice for
     these teaching hospitals. It isn't a mandate," said Ari Fleischer, a
     spokesman for committee chairman Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas.
     Others wondered whether it was necessary. The number of doctors
     training to become specialists in some fields has declined
     dramatically despite the subsidy program, the Post article said, due
     to well-publicized warnings that jobs for specialists were only
     available in less populated areas.
     The United States boasts over 700,000 physicians, more per capita
     than any other country.

Forwarded message:
Not shure exactly how to answer this as I don't really measure it but I will
pass along my experience and describe the network on this end...
einstein.ssz.com is a 486DX2 80 linked via ISDN to a FDDI/T3/T1 backed up'ed link to the major SprintNet and MCI backbone here in Austin, Tx. Our typical
physical latency is about 30mS taken from the average of a continous ping
that I use as a baseline. When Majordomo receives a submission it then
immediately resends it. Assuming the pipe ain't clogged and I run about 15%
use with an all time max of about 90%. Usualy, taken from listening to the
hard drive chatter, the resend latency is about 30s to 5m when the pipe gets
heavily used. Typical peak usage is very sporadic and never lasts more than
5 minutes or so. There are two other small networks dialed in 28.8 that are
the major driver of the intermittent loads. One is a commercial video
business and the other is a local Amiga/NT/Mac/Linux BBS (Phantoms Mansion,
oldest surviving bbs in Austin, in existance since '82. I started in '83).
Our current expansion plans are to take the main pipe to a T1 sometime
toward the end of next month. We will then upgrade the dial-ins to ISDN and
adding a intermittent ISDN dial-in along with 2 28.8 dial-ins. The two
dedicated dial-ins will also be expanding to ISDN and I am adding another
dedicated ISDN customer network as well.
SSZ has been on ISDN since Oct. of '92 and in that time we have been down
for more than hours on two occassions. The first was on Mar. 20, 1995 when
one of my lodgers managed to burn the house down. The second was around
last New Year when I moved and SWBT couldn't move the ISDN for 21 days. We
used a 28.8 during that time and physical latency was about 150mS or so.
The current move scheduled for about 3 weeks away is expected to be
accomplished in less than an hour so hopefuly nobody will even notice...
I currently only echo messages to algebra.com because their the only ones
who've asked. We currently are subscribed to toad.com and algebra.com. We
have an open subscription policy meaning all it takes is an inquiry...
Currently the only reason there would be a significant delay is that we on
occassion have majordomo barf on itself and erase the subscribers list. But
we have a backup and it only takes a cp to get it back up, this process is
not automated - hence the delay. Considering the old versions of Linux and
Majordomo (nearly 4 years old) this is remarkable to me since it is the only
major glitch in the software. We are expecting to upgrade einstein to a
Pentium box with much newer software during next month as well.
Our policy on submissions to the list is one of complete hands-off except
for checking for duplicates and loops.
Other boxes that are intermittently available through SSZ and drive our
load are:

                           bursts (intentional behaviour) and lasts for

                 CHILDREN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO POISON TEACHER
     August 24, 1997
     Web posted at: 8:31 p.m. EDT (0031 GMT)
     HAMPTON, Virginia (CNN) -- Four pupils have been charged with
     felonies for allegedly planning to poison their fifth-grade teacher
     with a mixture of oils, soaps and household cleaners.
     The two boys and two girls, now ages 10 and 11, were charged as
     juveniles Friday with attempting to poison and conspiracy to commit
     a felony, said Jeff Walden, spokesman for the Hampton Police
     Department. The names of the youngsters and the teacher were
     withheld.
     On January 15, a classmate overheard the four pupils discussing ways
     to kill their teacher, and told school authorities, Walden said. The
     principal confronted each pupil and found one carrying a glass vial
     containing a liquid that allegedly was to be used to poison the
     teacher's food.
     The four weren't charged until now, because authorities had to wait
     for laboratory test results, police said. The tests indicated the
     mixture would have made the teacher sick, but would not necessarily
     have killed her.
     The Associated Press contributed to this report.

@_subject: Cypherpunks, PGP Buyout, & Writing Code... 
Perhaps the buy-out of PGP is a good thing. Consider that now there is a
clear and present motive for Cypherpunks to start writing the next wave of
world-class crypto...it really is the *only* shure way that the process
doesn't get subverted...we're no longer able to rely on a single commen
source of crypto tools.

@_subject: ISDN is back!....yippeeee 
The ISDN just came back online...now if only the POTS will return...
Anyway, SWBT Level 2 and their protocol analysis seems to have done the
trick this time. As soon as I get my POTS back I'll lack the ISDN folks and
find out what the problem was.
Be advised that SWBT may still have their analyzer online which means they
are doing a full capture of all the Internet related traffic.

Forwarded message:
Why does your remailer strip the subject header?
What has this to do with a couple of rednecks stopping an alleged criminal
out of the goodness of their hearts? Further, what exactly are you talking
about in reference to Gates? Yes, he is rich but what specificaly are you
referning to in regards to his mentality and lynch-mob democracies?
All government or social systems resort to lynch-mod mentatility without
some sort of bill of rights or other explicit restrainer on the system. Even
free-market-crypto-anarchy will devolve to this. Why do supports of
free-market-crypto-anarchy ignore issues regarding excesses of their beloved
systems and what kinds of checks-and-balances need to be implimented to
resolve those issues? Are you really going to claim that under
free-market-crypto-anarchy we have finaly found angels in the forms of men?
Is your claim that had there been a free-market-cryto-anarchy these people
would not have committed the crime in the first place and hence the police
and the rednecks could have stayed home? Is free-market-crypto-anarchy the
final solution in human conflict resolution?
This is a tenet of democracy as well. However, am I to interpret your
statement to mean that no, these rednecks were out of line? If so, my
question still stands. With no centralized authority of any sort and by
extension no centralized police force whose job is it to stop criminals?
Under a free-market-crypto-anarchy exactly how does the peace-keeping
process work?
If there were no police force I am sure Gates with all his money would be
on the top of a lot of hit lists - just too juicy a target to pass up. The
police we have now are deputized citizens. *That* happens to be one of the
safety checks.
What is your point?

This seems to me to be a step backward. Indecent at least has an implicit
relationship with sex while harmful to minors does not. Does the bill make
some notice that it applies only to sex and sex related issues or can this
be applied to any subject matter that would be harmful to minors? This
could impact all sorts information such as bomb info, ways to make booze, drug related sites, etc.

Public anonymity and having an unlisted phone number are not even the same
thing. An unlisted phone number is to reduce public exposure, anonymity is
to enhance public exposure and secure plausible deniability. To have an
analogous situation you would need to use a *listed* phone number registered
to anonymous in such a way that ANI displayed the number but any directory
search resulted in anonymous w/ no address or other tracing info even for
the phone company. To the best of my knowledge no phone company anywhere
will allow a customer to purchase service without identifying themselves to
the phone company. Please let me know if there is such a beast somewhere.

That isn't the same as having it listed under the nym 'anonymous', when

I own some land, you go putting a sign on my fence without my permission and
I promise you I will press tresspasing charges in an instant, even if I
agree with the sentiment. I've had to threaten several DPS officers (Texas
state troopers) with this because they like to park their cruiser in the drive
outside my fence but still within the property line without asking my
permission to do paperwork and eat.
They don't do it anymore.

Hi John,
Forwarded message:
Sorry dude, it isn't against the law in Texas to threaten an officer when
they are committing a crime, and trespassing on private property without
permission, in pursuit of a suspect, or a warrant is most definitely a crime
in this state, even for police. In this state if I catch somebody on my
property at night in the process of what I *believe* is theft is even
grounds for me to use deadly force; but *only* between sunset and sunrise.
About 3 years ago we had a female UT-Austin student shoot and kill a peeping
tom in the middle of town. She saw the guy through her window, got her gun,
went outside and dropped the guy. No charges were filed because it was
after dark and his trespassing on the apartment property was enough to
invoke the above referenced law. There was a lot of screaming and yelling
from a bunch of bleeding hearts about it, but the law still stands.
You really should try to understand why you cow-tow to 'The Man'....

Why didn't you file against them? Texas judges don't take kindly to the DPS
pulling this sort of shit. I worked at UT-Austin from 1984 to 1990 for the
Physical Plant taking care of their nifty burglar alarm system (at the time
really cutting edge compared to the rest of the industry) and got to work with UTPD, which because it is a state school are really DPS officers -
unbeknownst to most folks, and find about half of them are real rednecks who
get away with this sort of shit because nobody ever files on them. Did you
know that if a DPS officer gets some number of complaints within a period
(used to be 3 within 30 days) they were removed from active duty pending a
review. It is even possible to have a officer fired if they recieve enough
complaints. Most cops only get 3-4 complaints a year. It is *critical* for
the system to work correctly that *every* infraction gets reported and if
appropriate to file charges. Even if you don't win the cop will lose, the complaints go on their permanent record and get evaluated yearly and have
a direct impact on their promotions and eligibility for other jobs.
My brother has a really cheeky way to deal with this sort of shit. Once it
is clear they are going to let him go he pulls some coin out of his pocket
and hands it to the officer telling them "Here you go, go buy a
My personal method is to hand them my drivers license (if I'm on a public
road and driving) and then refuse to answer any further questions. I usually
answer with something like "I'm sorry officer, I'm not required to talk to
you". My goal is to get the cop to either let me go right there or arrest me.
Either way I win. Usually the most they get from me is a shrug. So far it's
worked for me, never been arrested except one time when they had a computer
screw up on a 6 year old ticket. Got arrested, posted bond, showed up at the
hearing and requested to see the physical ticket. Charges were dropped because
not only could they not produce the ticket but they couldn't produce any other
evidence of the crime. My ace in the hole was that I still had the court
receipt where I paid the ticket, never had to use it.
Only because you allowed it by not filing. I sympathize with your situation
but find your acceptance a little puzzling as well. By your inactivity you
are promoting such behaviour. Democracy doesn't work if you are complacent
or of a compromising nature. While it's true you might loose the fight, if
you don't even try its guaranteed you have no chance of winning.
A system works because the people refuse to allow it to fail. My personal
philosophy is that if people would stand up and shout more they would be
more immune to harrassment and other similar activities because it reduces
the payoff to such abusive activities. Shine a light on cockroaches and they
run for the dark. It's one of the reasons that I support this mailing list
even thought I disagree personaly with the vast majority of views expressed
by it. Should something happen to SSZ and by extension me, quite a few people
who know me personaly and professionaly will get more than a bit curious
after a couple of days of downtime if they don't hear from me. I further
advertise this because it makes shure that those who are intending to harass
me know that it is not an individual they are dealing with.
My phone service problems w/ SWBT are because they are known for being
incompetent. The problems that I have had with ISDN reliability are a known
problem to the ISP's and heavy ISDN users through-out Texas. The reason that
the ISDN folks and the POTS folks can't get their act together is that they
use the same cable sets but keep different books and operate as an
indipendant business division, one is residential and the other business.
There are limited numbers of pairs in the neighborhood (it's only about 100
years old) so what happens is the ISDN guy looks at the various pairs, his
records are out of date a week or more and as a result don't have the recent
cable changes from my most recent POTS service call and therefore those pairs
are listed as free so he uses them. This causes the POTS to fail, who comes out
and now his records are out of date and he sees the ISDN pairs as unused and
pulls them to fix the POTS. Round and round we go...
[one of my users thinks this is a big conspiracy on the part of SWBT, the
city, state, and federal agencies to put me out of business and shut me up.
Personaly, I can't imagine being that big a fish.]
Doesn't the fact that SWBT now has some say in Bell Atlantic and Bell South
just warn the cockles of your heart....;) [anyone know how a clam, cockle,
got involved in this saying?]
Don't know if it is really on topic but both Bell Atlantic and Bell South
use Tivoli to support their backbones and other services machines. There is
currently a big internal fight (as I understand it) because SWBT has bought
major stakes in both companies and SWBT wants them to use SWBT's custom
self-developed piece of shit (personal opinion here as a long time SWBT
customer, not indicative of either Tivoli or IBM's official or unofficial
views; I'm just a lowly Senior Engineer and they don't let techies like me
in on the political talks) network management software instead of using
I can say this, in the last 3 months since moving to this new house I have
had 8 trouble tickets. None have been repaired in less than 2 days and the
longest was like 6. Every time SWBT says it's my hardware, I swap out
routers or check my wiring, but it ends up being their problem. I've been
charged $30 for a onsite call that should have been paid by SWBT. I have
repeatedly been advised to invoke their Level 2 Protocol Analysis support at
$60/30 minutes and I have to pay the bill first and will only get
reimbursed *if* SWBT decides it really is their problem. When I talked to
them the other day I mentioned that I am thinking of getting the PUC
involved along with a lawyer. Their responce was, verbatim, "Sir, do
whatever you want to do." I gave them a couple of chances to make it right
and I warned them I would fight. I'm currently starting proceedings with PUC.
Did you know that if you are late on a SWBT bill one time your billing
period is reduced, your monthly payment goes up, and it does this for a year
following the occurance.
So I figure that if you think your phone service is bad now wait a year you
ain't seen nothing yet...

We got nothing here.
The fact is that the charges that were used at the state and federal level
were different charges relating to the same incident. This is *not* double
jeopardy in any sense of the word. Further, other than the Feds deciding to
wait until the outcome of the state trial there was nothing that would have
prevented them from filing in tandem.
Furthermore, this rampant equating of federal and state rights is a real
disservice to understanding the correct functioning of a democracy. State
and federal government agencies are supposed to be equal and indipendant
within the guidelines of the Constitution. As a result for a given act
it is perfectly reasonable and actualy desirable for the state and federal
agencies to file in parallel and indipendently. Re-read the 10th with this
case in mind and perhaps it will clear the confusion up for you.

Yeah, and the way it works is that some 3rd party buys a trunk from the
local RBOC and then sets up their PBX and then re-sells the lines. Here's
your test for them. Buy a line and have them list it in the RBOC directory
under 'anonymous'.
Not the same thing as going directly to the RBOC and having them list your
number under 'anonymous'. THAT is the litmus test for true anonymous
phone service *and* to make it equivalent to an anonymous remailer with
address persistance.

Recently a pirate radio was charged by the FCC for operating without a
license. The judge in the case heard the arguments and said their was merit
in the question of constitutionality of the FCC regulations. The radio was
allowed to stay on the air while both sides prepared their cases. Apparently
the judge said something about this being the first time such constitutional
questions had been raised.
There is also at least one piece of cpunks traffic in this about 2 weeks
old when the judge made the ruling.
I believe there might be something at one of the ARRL sites.

JUDGE WILKEN DENIES FCC MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGEMENT!!!
  Press Release Follows. To Go Directly To The Full Text Of Judge Wilken's
  Decision, Click Here
National Lawyers Guild Committee on Democratic Communications
  558 Capp Street, San Francisco 94110
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                 COURT REJECTS FCC'S CONSTITUTIONAL CATCH 22
     United States District Court Judge Claudia Wilken has rejected
     another attempt by the Federal Communications Commission to silence
     Berkeley Micro Radio Broadcaster Stephen Dunifer, founder of Free
     Radio Berkeley.
     In a 13 page opinion released on November 12, 1997, Judge Wilken
     once again rejected the government's motion for an injunction to
     silence micro radio broadcasts by local radio pioneer Stephen
     Dunifer.
     In 1995, Judge Wilken rejected the government's first motion for a
     preliminary injunction against Dunifer's broadcasts. At that time
     the Court found merit in Dunifer's argument that the FCC's ban on
     low power, affordable FM broadcasting was a violation of the First
     Amendment's guarantee of free speech to all in the United States.
     In a blatant attempt to avoid facing its First Amendment obligations
     the FCC then urged Wilken to permanently enjoin Dunifer from
     Broadcasting and at the same time argued that she could not even
     consider the issue of whether its rules, which prevent him from
     getting a license, are unconstitutional. In a Kafkaesqe argument,
     the Commission argued that Wilken had jurisdiction to issue an
     injunction, but no jurisdiction to hear Dunifer's constitutional
     arguments. The government claimed that only the higher federal
     courts could consider the constitutional question.
     In her November 12 decision rejecting the Government's position,
     Judge Wilken pointed to the fact that the FCC had taken exactly the
     opposite position in the 1994 case of Dougan vs FCC. In that case,
     an Arizona micro radio broadcaster had appealed an FCC fine (for
     broadcasting without a license) to the 9th Circuit Federal Court of
     Appeal, and the FCC had argued that the Court of Appeal had no
     jurisdiction over the case, and that it had to be heard by the
     District Court. The Court of Appeals agreed with the FCC and sent
     the case back to the District Court.
     Judge Wilken noted that the Arizona broadcaster had raised the same
     constitutional arguments in the Court of Appeals that Dunifer is
     raising. The Court ruled that in sending all of the issues in the
     Arizona case to the District Court, the Appeals Court recognized
     that the District Court had jurisdiction over all aspects of the
     case.
     In denying the Government's motion for an injunction "without
     prejudice," Judge Wilken ordered the Government to file a further
     brief on the question of whether the unconstitutionality of the
     FCC's ban on micro radio is a valid legal defense to an injunction
     against broadcasting at low power without a license. Dunifer's
     attorneys, Louis Hiken and Allen Hopper of San Francisco, will have
     an opportunity to rebut the government's arguments on this point.
     In response to pressure from the commercial broadcaster's lobby, the
     National Association of Broadcasters (N.A.B.), the FCC has in recent
     months been stepping up its campaign of harassment against the
     thousands of micro radio stations now on the air in this country.
     Hiken commented "The broadcast industry is clearly afraid of these
     little community stations which are speaking truth to its power. In
     trying to do the N.A.B.'s bidding, the FCC demonstrates that it is
     nothing but an enforcement arm of the commercial broadcast industry
     and the multi-national corporations which own it."
     The National Lawyers Guild's Committee on Democratic Communications
     has represented the Lawyers Guild, San Francisco's Media Alliance,
     and the Women's International News Gathering Services as a "Friend
     of the Court" (Amicus) in this case. In its Friend of the Court
     brief the Lawyers Guild pointed out that FCC regulations make it
     impossible for all but the very wealthy to even apply for a
     broadcast license. This, they told the Court, is the equivalent of
     saying anyone could speak from a soap box in the park, but the box
     had to be made of gold. Guild attorney Peter Franck commented "In an
     era when Disney owns ABC, the world's largest defense contractor
     owns NBC and CNN merges with Time which merges with Warner, and when
     'public' broadcasting is told to get its money from corporations,
     micro radio may be our last best hope for democracy on the air
     ways." He continued "Judge Wilken's decision is a courageous
     rejection of the Government's attempt to use a legal Catch-22 to
     avoid facing the fact that its ban on micro radio flies in the face
     of the Constitution."
     The legal team representing Dunifer and the Amicae are very pleased
     with Judge Wilken's reasoned and thorough decision denying the FCC's
     motion to have the case resolved without a trial on the merits. For
     almost 70 years, the FCC has catered solely to the interests of
     commercial corporate giants, through their mouthpiece, the National
     Association of Broadcasters. These are the pirates, who have stolen
     the airwaves from the American people, and who represent corporate
     interests valued at more than 60 billion dollars. Only the Pentagon,
     the Silicon Valley and the transportation industries possess the
     financial wallop represented by the NAB and its constituents.
     Judge Wilken's decision represents a vision of what it would be like
     for the American people to be given back their own voice. The
     decision suggests the likely unconstitutionality of the entire
     regulatory structure underlying the FCC's ban on low power radio. It
     forewarns of the total failure of that agency to carry out its
     statutory obligation to regulate the airwaves in the public interest
     -- that is, in the interest of the American people, rather than the
     media monopolies that control our airwaves.
     The legal team welcomes the opportunity to have a court identify the
     real pirates of the airwaves -- not the thousands of microradio
     broadcasters who seek to communicate with the people of their
     communities, but rather the billionaire commercial interests that
     control the airwaves as if they own them. Is it General Electric,
     Westinghouse and the Disney Corporation that have the right to
     control local community radio, or is that a right that belongs to
     all of the American people, regardless of economic status?

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,       No. C 94-03542 CW
Plaintiff,                      ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S
                                MOTION FOR SUMMARY
v.                              JUDGMENT WITHOUT
                                PREJUDICE AND REQUESTING
STEPHEN P. DUNIFER,             FURTHER BRIEFING
By this action, the United States, on behalf of its agency,
the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), seeks declaratory
and injunctive relief against Defendant Stephen P. Dunifer for
operating a radio station, "Free Radio Berkeley," without a
license in violation of 47 U.S.C.S 301 of the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. S 151 et seq. Several amici curiae
have filed a brief supporting the FCC. Mr. Dunifer does not
dispute that he is broadcasting without a license and that he has
never applied for a license. Mr. Dunifer does not question the
constitutionality ot the statute that requires broadcasters to
obtain a license. Mr. Dunifer asserts, however, that relief
should not be granted to the FCC because he cannot obtain a
license to broadcast under the FCC'S regulations, which he claims
are unconstitutional. The FCC regulations do not allow for the
licensing of micro radio broadcasters, that is, radio broadcasters
who, like Mr. Dunifer, use ten watts or less to power their
signals.(1) Presently before the Court is the FCC'S motion for
summary judgement which Mr. Dunifer and several amici curiae
oppose. The matter was heard on April 12, 1996.Having
considered all of the papers filed by the parties and oral
argument on the motion, the Court DENIES the FCC's motion without
prejudice and requests further briefing.
LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is properly granted when no genuine and
disputed issues of material fact remain, and when, viewing the
evidence most favorably to the non-moving party, the movant is
clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P.
56; CelotexCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986);
Eisenberg v. Insurance Co. of North America, 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-
89(9th Cir. 1987).
The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no
material factual dispute. Therefore, the Court must regard as
true the opposing party's evidence, if supported by atfidavits or
other evidentiary material.Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Eisenberg,
 court under 47 U.S.C. S 402 (a). This means that only the district
 court has jurisdiction over this action; this is not a situation
 where two courts have simultaneous jurisdiction. Therefore, the
 Ninth Circuit's concern in Dougan about Mr. Dougan having two
 bites of the apple is not applicable. However, like 47 U.S.C.
 S 504(a), 47 U.S.C. S 401(a) provides that the FCC may initiate a
 specific type of enforcement action in the district court. The
 Ninth Circuit in Dougan determined that 47 U.S.C.S 504 (a)
 required Mr. Dougan to bring his lawsuit, including his
 constitutional challenges to the FCC regulation, in the district
 court. By analogy, it would appear that 47 U.S.C. S 401 (a)
 provides the district court with jurisdiction to hear not only the
 FCC's charge of broadcasting without a license, but also any valid
 defense to the charge. If the unconstitutionality of the FCC
 regulatory scheme that does not permit Mr. Dunifer to obtain a
 license would be a valid defense to a charge of broadcasting
 without a license, then that defense would be encompassed within
 the grant of jurisdictionto the district court provided in 47
 U.S.C. S 401(a).
        The FCC has submitted a recent case decided in the District
 of Minnesota which, under facts similar to those in the case at
 bar, held that district courts do not have jurisdiction over
 constitutional challenges to FCC regulations raised as defenses in
 an FCC action to enforce a forfeiture order. United States v. Any
 and All Radio Station Transmission Equipment, et al., _ F. Supp.
_, 1997 WL 591127 (D. Minn.) ("Transmission Equipment"). In
Transmission Eqipment, the FCC filed suit in district court to
enforce a forfeiture order against a micro radio station on the
ground that it was broadcasting without a license. Id. at *1.
The defendant admitted to broadcasting without a license but
raised affirmative defenses challenging the constitutionality of
the FCC regulatory scheme that did not allow the licensing of
micro radio stations. Id. at *2. The court distinguished
Pleasant Broadcasting on the grounds that the petitioners there
disputed that they had violated a statute or regulation; the
relevant language required "repeated" violations and both
petitioners admitted to one, but not to repeated violations. Id.
at *3. The court concluded that Pleasant Broadcasting did not
apply to the facts before it because the defendant in Transmission
Equipment did not dispute that he violated the statute prohibiting
broadcasting without a license, but instead raised constitutional
challenges to the FCC's regulatory scheme as affirmative defenses.
Id. The court could not distinguish Dougan on the same ground
because Mr. Dougan admitted that he had broadcast without a
license, as did the defendant in Transmission Equipment. Id.at
*4. Instead, the court interpreted Dougan as involving only a
dispute over whether Mr. Dougan had violated 47 C.F.R. S 15.29 by
refusing to permit FCC engineers to inspect his radio station.
Id. The court distinguished Dougan on the ground that Mr. Dougan
challenged the FCC's forfeiture order and did not challenge the
FCC's prohibition against low power broadcasting. Id.
However, as discussed above, in Dougan, the Ninth Circuit
specifically noted that Mr. Dougan had raised constitutional
defenses to the FCC's licensing regulations in addition to a
defense based on 47 C.F.R. S 15.29. Dougan, 21 F.3d at 1489.
Moreover, in ruling that the district court had exclusive
jurisdiction to hear Mr. Dougan's action to avoid enforcement, the
Ninth Circuit neither explicitly stated nor implied that the
district court could only hear Mr. Dougan's defense based on 47
C.F.R.� 15~29, and not his constitutional defenses. The court
did not retain jurisdiction over Mr. Dougan's constitutional
challenge to the regulation.
 A case cited by neitner party, United States v. Evergreen
Media Corp of Chicago, involved an action brought by the
government in district court to enforce a forfeiture order issued
by the FCC. 832 F. Supp. 1183 (N.D. Ill. 1933). The forfeiture
order was issued as a result of the FCC's determination that
Evergreen Media, a radio station, had violated 18 U.S.C. � 1464, a
criminal statute imposing a fine or imprisonment as punishment for
uttering obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio
communication. Id. at 1184. The defendant filed a counterclaim
challenging the constitutionality of IS U.S.C. � 1464. Id. The
counterclaim alleged that 18 U.S.C. � 1464 was facially
unconstitutional both for vagueness and for overbreadth, and that
18 U.S.C. � 1464 was unconstitutional as applied, on the ground
that the FCC's interpretation of the statute was not the least
restrictive means of accomplishing the goals of the statute.Id.
The defendant also alleged that the FCC's enforcement of the
statute constituted a violation of substantive due process and of
the Equal Protection Clause. Id. The FCC argued that the court
lacked jurisdiction to hear any claims raised by the defendant
which attacked the FCC's policies, practices or regulations. Id.
at 1186. The court found that it had jurisdiction to hear the
 defendant's constitutional challenges to the FCC'S regulations
interpreting 18 U.S.C. S 1464. Id. at 1184-86. Citing Pleasant
Broadcasting, the court found that 47 U.S.C!. � 504(a), which gives
district courts jurisdiction to hear forfeiture actions, provides
an exception to the general rule that challenges to regulations
must be heard in a court of appeal. Id. Evergreen Media provides
additional support for the conclusion that this Court has
jurisdiction to hear Mr. Dunifer's constitutional claims.
 Although the FCC and Mr. Dunifer address the issue of whether
this Court has jurisdiction to hear Mr. Dunifer'sconstitutional
challenges to tho FCC'S regulations, neither party has adequately
briefed whether the alleged unconstitutionality of the licensing
regulations is a valid defense to a request for an injunction
against broadcasting without a license. That is, assuming
arguendothat the regulations were unconstitutional, would this
justify Mr. Dunifer's action of broadcasting without having, or
even attempting to obtain, a license and prevent the FCCfrom
obtaining an injuction? Dougan does not address this question.
Mr. Dunifer asumes that the alleged unconstitutionality of the
regulations would be a valid defense. While it criticizes Mr.
Dunifer for failing to seak a license, the FCC largely confines
its argument to its view that the Court is without jurisdiction to
hear the unconstitutionality defense at all. If the
unconstitutionality of the regulations would be a defense under
these circumstances, this Court would be reguired to determine
whether the regulations are in fact unconstitutional. Otherwise,
the Court need not consider the constitutional issue.
 In support of hts argument, Mr. Dunifer analogizes his
situation to that of a criminal defendant seeking to defend
himself on the ground that the regulation under which he was being
prosecuted was unconstitutional. The FCC responds that in United
states v.Alloy, 755 F. Supp. 771, 775 (N.D. Ill. 1990), the court
precluded the defendant from raising constitutional challenges to
a regulation he was accused of violating. In Alley, however, the
defendant did not argue that the regulation was unconstitutional.
Rather the defendant argued that the regulation was unlawful
because the administrative agency, in promulgating the regulation,
had acted outside the scope of authority granted to it by
Congress. Id.The court, moreover, noted that the statutory
scheme specifically forbade judicial review in any civil or
criminal proceeding for enforcement of the regulation under which
the defendant was charged. Id. The FCC has not pointed to any
provision of the Communications Act which specifically prohibits
judicial review cf a licensing regulation in an enforcement
proceeding. Furthermore, even if Alley were applicable here, a
single district court case from another circuit is slim authority
on which to base this decision.
 Therefore, the Court requests that the parties provide
further briefing on the issue of whether the unconstitutionality
of the FCC regulatory scheme would be a valid defense in an action
brought by the FCC to enjoin broadcasting without a license. The
FCC shall file with the Court and serve on Mr. Dunifer its brief
on this issue 14 days from the date of this order. Mr. Dunifer's
opposition is due 7 days thereafter. If the FCC wishes to file a
reply, it may due so 7 days after the opposition is served.
For the foregoing reasons, the FCC's motion for summary
judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. The parties are ordered to
comply with the briefing schedule indicated above.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

It's "information wants to be free". A subtle but profound distinction.
It's a real pitty Hayek never tried 'cooperation' instead of 'compromise'.
Oh, the short-short sightedness of ego and tryanny.
What is the line of reasoning that the *only* solution for society is to
stamp out individuality? Sounds more like wishful thinking from some
brain-dead drone with no imagination or respect for others.
Perhaps he should have stuck with economics and kept away from sociology.

Bullshit, your Burroughs-esk not withstanding. I believe Jim Bell's AP
proposal is sheer insanity with no real merit other than clear and open
endorsement of anarchy. I have always said this and will always say it.
However, I *do* support his right to *talk* about it all he wants. When he
or others begin to *act* upon it then I say do to them exactly what they are
wanting to do to others - nail their hide to a wall. Violence has one and
*only* one justification - immediate self-defence.
His putting stink bombs in a federal building deserves some punishment. It
is nothing more than a petty childish prank and should be treated as such.
Bottem line with Jim Bell, he is a selfish child who refuses to grow up. Let
him reap what he sows.
The federal responce to this and other forms of civil disobedience are
equealy without merit.
My view: neither the feds or Jim Bell have two halves of a clue to rub
It certainly hasn't changed my beliefs or my plans to act on them one whit.
The difference is that I believe the system can be fixed, yes it will take
time, yes it will require a certain level of jamming unsavory morsels of the
Constitution down some tyrants throats; but it is doable.
Personaly, I would not plea bargain, I would not accept a court appointed
attorney, I would claim political prisoner status, and further I would
immediately appeal my conviction to the Supreme Court. I say this openly and
in public in order to give the Feds one of two options: leave me alone and
accept my civil disobedience for what it is or let's tango in the courts and
let the supreme law of the land draw the lines in the sand. My faith in the
strength of this country rests in the Constitution and the ideals it stands
For a start:
1. I oppose the current tax laws. The Constitutional amendment was *never*
   legaly ratified and was never intended to make individual citizens pay
   40% of their taxes to support the federal govt.
2. Agencies such as NOAA, FBI, BATF, NASA, etc. are not constitutional
   because there is *no* section of the Constitution that delegates those
   issues to the feds. Per the 10th they go to the states or the people
   unless an amendment is enacted.
3. The DoD is currently engaging in contracts that extend over the
   Constitutionaly mandated 2 year limit for anything other than naval
   forces. They also allow the use of military personnel and equipment
   by civil law enforcement - a clear violation of both the letter and
   spirit of the Constitution.
4. I oppose the extension of the inter-state commerce clause because
   regulation does not imply the level of law enforcement and the use of
   force that is currently employeed. I further object to the apparent
   skipping over of the last sentence of the inter-state commerce clause
   which clearly invokes the 9th and 10th.
5. The 14th Amendment does *not* extend *any* protection of rights to the
   states - only privileges and immunities. I further believe that such
   extension at the state level is a bad thing.
6. The fed's interest in doctor assissted suicides is misplaced. There is
   *no* mandate for this to be a federal issue.
7. The use of drugs is *not* mandated by the Constitution to be a federal
   issue.
8. The Constitution does not allow *any* seizing of private property,
   legaly or illegaly gained, without compensation to the owner of
   that property.
9. There is a whole raft of political party rules and regulations that
   limit the participation in government of many smaller organizations.
   These limits are un-Constitutional.
If you or anyone else doesn't like the way it works then get an amendment
passed that changes the way the rules operate.
In short my main bitch is that the Supreme Court of the US doesn't say
"Ain't our problem" nearly enough and when it does speak the question it
should be asking is "Does the Constitution allow this power to the federal
govt. within the constraints of the 9th and 10th?". Neither Congress or
the Supreme Court act in a manner to honor either the letter or the spirit
of the Constitution and in particular the 9th and 10th Amendments.
I believe that *every* federal law and regulation *must* be able to
demonstrate its lineage from one or more sentences in the Constitution
before it is applicable and legal by the 10th.
Personaly, I want to bring charges against Congress and the Supreme Court of
the US for actions contrary to those granted them under the Constitution. In
short, I want to impeach the whole kit and kaboodle.
I also want to get an amendment passed such that representation in
government is related to percentages of votes cast for individual parties and not the over all winning party of the votes counted.
I not only blame myself (as well as all citizens), but I expect to do
something about it over the remainder of my life.
I learned several lessons from Operation Sun Devil. The most important one
was that if you compromise you loose. Phiber Optik and his ilk plea
bargained and he went to jail. Mentor, Erik Bloodaxe, & Steve Jackson
refused and they walk around free men to this day (it's interesting that these folks are all here in Austin).
There's not? You sir, don't have one whit of morality, ethics, or empathy.
Let alone any sort of sense of justice or liberty.
I hope your happy licking the hands of your keepers.

Well that is the litmus test after all, not the goals but rather the means.
I wouldn't say that. I just can't justify them unless under direct physical
attack. I am *not* a pacifist.
I hadn't really entertained the condition that the 'fight' necessarily has
to end in my life time. It certainly didn't end in Thomas Jeffersons. I do
know that if we don't try we have zero chance of gaining any of them, let
alone all of them. And who knows what the future may bring. Personaly I give
the US about 20 years before a general political - economic - societal
breakdown occurs. I believe that it will be even less violent but just as
radical a change as the fall of the CCCP. I further believe that movement
will *demand* ethical and reasonably justifiable reference to the respective
constitutional documents. I also believe that within about a period of 10
years there will be a significant increase in the number of federal
amendments clarifying many of the very issues we discuss today. I believe
many things will drive the change. Among them medical technology which will
re-grow cloned organs to replace any damaged or diseased ones you may have.
I suspect that instead of terra-forming people will clone themselves and
geneticaly engineer the embryo to adapt to the relevant environemt (Hint:
Dougal Dixon). I believe this technology will fine tune the legal issues we
ponder today to a fine edge. I believe the 9th and 10th will be recognized
for the defining tests of all federal, state, and individual jurisdictional
issues. I believe that as a result of those changes individuals will benefit
by being considered equaly with federal and state views.
I believe that people will recognize the totality of the current issues as
the exact same excesses. People will realize that the camp that demanded
specific bills of rights have the right idea. As a result we will get through
indipendant state action several amendments. Those movements will be very
goal specific and short lived. They will further depend on the Internet for
their existance. I believe they will start with individuals in specific
points across the US getting in touch and defining a small and specific set
of goals (ie Demonstrate constitutionaly that individuals have a right to
doctor assisted suicide and that it is an invasion of individual privacy.).
As those goals percolate via passive and active processes across the
Internet a commen experience will grow. An important question to consider:
How long must you hold a sufficient totality of state representation to
consider and pass a constitutional amendment?
No. However, that proves nothing. Simply because something has not happened
is no guarantee it won't happen. In all of human history this is the first
time that the Internet has existed, photon transportation didn't exist as a
verifiable process until just recently, there is now a movement in the dog
lovers camp to save clonable samples of favorite pets in the hopes of
cloning their best loved pooch. Technology as succesful as ours breeds a
technocracy if it doesn't kill us.

@_subject: Civil War Crypto Question... 
I have been reading [1] regarding the beginning of the modern martial
traditions and methods. In chapter 2, 'Tactical and Strategic
Reorganization', in which the birth of the Signal Corp under Myer (by order
of McClellan) and the ensuing conflicts with Military Telegraph under Stager
are discussed. On pp. 43 - 44 there is a discussion on some processes that
Myer implimented including a 'cipher disk' whereby the Union was able to
change their telegraph codes on an hourly schedule. It was apparently very
effictive in dealing with taps and such.
Anyone know of another source that discusses this disk? I looked in Applied
Crypto as well as several other books including a Dover reprint of a book
from the 30's w/o success. I would in particular like to see a photo or
other diagram of its operation.
Thanks for any help you can provide.

Thanks for the reference.
Actualy it was used for telegraphy and flags. You see Mahan, the inventor of
the disk had also just invented the first ever alphabetic flag system.
Because of this system, instead of the wig-wag system others used, McClellan
was the first general in history to change his orders of attack 3 times in 3
days *and* win the battle. The problem on the Peninsula was the land was too
flat and the woods too thick to use it (see my original references around the
same few pages).
Friedman? Who the hell is Friedman? None of my references has anyone by that
named listed, let alone involved.
McClellan was the general in charge of the Army of the Potomac. Meyer was in
charge of the Signal Corp, which at the time was responsible for tactical
communications for McClellan. Originaly Meyer intended to use his new flag
system but because the terrain, flat and wooded, on the Peninsula they found
they weren't reliable. They were also using the balloons from the Union
Aeronautic Department under Lowe. They were quite effective, haven't found
out if they used Meyer's signal system. The flip side was the fully civilian
Military Telegraph under Stager which handled strategic telegraphy was
fighting Meyer for control of the various communications along technological
boundaries. At this time, while they were fighting the South and each other,
they brought in some Beardslee equipment (a rail-based portable telegraph
system) which apparently didn't work well at all. The Beardslee system was
the first use by an American army of portable telegraph equipment, it ran
between McClellan's headquarters to Stoneman's at Mechanicsville. Apparently
one of the chief problems was that wagons and people kept cutting the lines. Merry Christmas!

Spin-doctor bullshit. Technology is *created* by people. When the day comes
where we don't understand it we will quit making progress at the rate we

watching some cop-show then you will have no clue as to what is going on.

Actualy that was so far out in left field that I didn't make the connection.
Really couldn't care less about Friedman and his WWII views of the Civil
War, not relevant to what I am doing. And further, if Friedman is claiming
that this code wheel wasn't invented by the telegraphers, for the
telegraphers then perhaps he isn't as historicaly accurate as some claim of
him. It is clear that Myer invented the code wheel, per his and McClellans
own documents, expressely for telegraphy as a direct results of the success
of Myers new flag signaling system previous to the Peninsula campaign.
Perhaps there is some confusion over exactly *which part* of the Union Army
was using what. McClellan was using Myer and his techno-marvels at the
tactical level and this had no relation to the strategic communications -
the big boys might very well have been using some fancy transposition
After Antietam McClellan told Myer:
"When I start from this camp, I want to break loose from the regular
telegraph lines and depend upon those under my command."
The 'regular telegraph' was Military Telegraph which was the strategic
minded folks. That McClellan had no stomach for them is clear.

It means to lock the rifles safety and load it's chamber in preperation for

and such use it when talking about loading their bongs and I am shure other

In short it means "get ready for action".

Get your facts straight. The US has a library that from day 1 has been
citizen supported. Every state (that I am aware of) has a state library that
is funded by tax payers. Furthermore, Texas & Lousiana have had localy
supported libraries and schools before they were even states.

Well on my .22 I slide bullets down the loading tube and manualy cycle the
bolt. On the M1 carbine I simply insert the clip and cycle the bolt. On a
HK-33 or G3 you do the same sort of thing. Those are the ones I know how to
work because I have used them.
In general the safety locks the trigger and firing-pin mechanism not the
loading or chambering mechanism. I don't know of a safety on a rifle that
blocks the bolt. But I ain't a gun nut (IAAGN).
Revolvers are self-explanatory. Automatics generaly block the trigger and
firing-pin mechanism, again not the bolt. Just grab that damn thing above
the barrel and pull toward yourself with a loaded clip. When it releases
should be loaded and on safety. Certainly works that way on the 1911 that I
use on occassion where the hammer action is blocked (hint - don't drop it
when cocked and safetied). I don't think I have ever shot an automatic that
didn't work that way (all 3 or 4 of them). Again, IAAGN.

Would you be so kind as to give a specific example of a bolt action,
semi-automatic, or automatic rifle that can't be loaded on safe? I have
never seen a rifle that wouldn't allow this.
A parallel pistol example would be nice too, if you're so inclined.

This is only partialy correct, the fact is that half-cocked simply means the
pan-head is down or covered so if the flint strikes the firing plate a spark
will not be propogated into the firing chamber (a hole in the side of the
barrel) and hence fire the weapon. Firing one of these weapons is a two step
process once loaded and aimed. Pull the hammer back and remove the pan-head.
The pan-head is *always* opened just prior to firing in order to eliminate
as many causes of a mis-fire (eg rain hitting the pan-head or wind blowing
the primer charge out of the pan-head) as possible.
Traditionaly (as I was tought anyway) 'half-cocked' meant you didn't carry
through all the way in preperations to the final goal. It is clear that it
has taken on much broader meaning relating to general incompetance and
"Lock and load" is not in any of the infantry manuals I have ever seen from
before the mid-1800's. And in every case it refered to a modern weapon not
a muzzle load weapon. If anyone can point to an exception I would
appreciate it. In all of them it refers to safety'ing the weapon and then
loading a round into the chamber. It originaly came into use because of the
operation of a bolt-action rifle. If the gun wasn't on safety when the bolt
was driven home there was a small but real chance the firing pin (in the
back of the bolt you just jammed down with some zeal) would go off and cause
the weapon to mis-fire (if you and your buddy are both lucky - you missed
both of you).
As to the loading of the ball onto the gun-powder - you won't do it the way
described above but once. The black powder will go off on about the 3rd tap
and you won't have the two hands it takes to load a muzzle-loader. If you
*ever* load a black powder be *absolutely shure* that there is a ball pad
between the gun powder and the ball. It is *not* there for barrell sealing
or some other silly explanation - it's there to inhibit compressive
explosion of the black powder. Don't believe it, go down to the hardware or
feed store and buy a small can of black powder. Then get a 3/4" pipe and
cap. Put only one or two flakes of the black powder on the threads and then
tighten with a pipe wrench (wear gloves, glasses, and apron). After about a
half turn or so you should hear a distinct snapping sound. This is the black
powder going off. This is what will happen if black powder gets between the
ball and barrel while you're tapping - and there's a *lot* more gunpowder
than a couple of flakes to take your hand (and your face if you're silly
enough to be leaning over the barrel which is where not looking down the
barrel of a gun comes from).
Also, those guns didn't have safeties to engage. There was really only two
ways to enshure a safe weapon once loaded - either have the panhead closed
or take the flint or steel blade out of the hammer. Even when un-cocked the
hammer and blade rests on the firing plate and any stiff strike will cause a
spark. Easy to demonstrate - while holding one simply strike the hammer with
the heel of your hand while in the dark - that little spark is what blew
your face off.
You can buy working 'Brown Bessie' models at most any gun or decent hobby
store. They're cheap (around $100 last time I looked), loud, smelly, and
loads of fun...
Merry Christmas!

   The Gallup Organization
   USA Today
   More related sites... NEW YORK (CNNfn) - According to a CNN/USA
   Today/Gallup poll, Americans now favor, by a thin margin, a flat tax
   system in which all Americans would pay the same percentage of their
   income in taxes -- regardless of how much money they make.
   [INLINE] But the public opposes two central features of flat tax
   proposals: the elimination of deductions for mortgage interest and for
   charitable contributions.
   [INLINE] Only one third of the country would favor replacing the
   current income tax system with a national sales tax which would apply
   to all retail purchases. The public believes that most Americans pay
   their fair share in taxes.
   [INLINE] The poll interviewed 1,019 adult Americans on November 21-23.
   [INLINE] The results are as follows:
   [INLINE] Flat Tax System
   [INLINE] Favor, 51 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 46 percent
   [INLINE] Flat Tax System With No Mortgage Deduction
   [INLINE] Favor, 42 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 54 percent
   [INLINE] Flat Tax System With No Charitable Deduction
   [INLINE] Favor, 43 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 53 percent
   [INLINE] Replacing Income Tax With National Sales Tax
   [INLINE] Favor, 32 percent
   [INLINE] Oppose, 62 percent

Wrong, the LOC is for the people. It is there (originaly) to provide a

New York does not equate to 'all the states'. A more than trivial point in

Something related to a project you're working on is my guest guess. I had a
clear problem description and goal in mind both times I dealt with them. My
experience is that just about any research organization like that simply
wants some assurance of legitimacy regarding the use of resources in that
institution, they got a bottem line they have to toe. In my various diggings
I have *never* been turned away from any reference stack if I could provide
them with clear descriptions and goals. Then again, I don't go in raving and
ranting and making lot's of demands either...
The first time I had reference to them was when I worked for the DoD during
college ('80-'83 @ UT) when I had to do some research on a RTL project for
Capt. Gene Barton of the US Army. Not that he would necessarily know
anything about it. I made the requests for specific information through the
engineering library at UT and they contacted both LoC and the Patent Office
on prior art. I was designing a non-Von Neumann router from TTL random gates
and needed to see how some folks had resolved some similar addressing (very
sticky wicket that in regards RTL architectures) issue. The second time was
when I was working for Austron here in Austin doing time reference standards
(1210's, 2055's, 2000 & 5000 LORAN recievers - it you got one and it was
done by triangle-nine it's mine) and needed to do some reference requests
for one of the engineers (I unfortunately don't remember his name) into rf
propogation models in the 10kHz range because of some problem the US Navy
was having off Korea. Past that I don't know as there was some sort of
security issue involved.
Neither time did it take more than a couple of phone calls (numbers provided
for me) and some faxes. I also don't believe that anyone on the other end
know anything more about my projects other than the librarian on my end
saying something like "I have a user who wants to request ...".
YMMV of course.
You don't have to travel farther than your local public library. Now whether
the librarian wants to spend their time working on your project is a whole
'nother (personal) issue.
If you want to know more specifics I suggest you call information in DC and
ask for the main number. From there you're on your own. I'm working on a
small book proposal & ASL expansion pack regarding the Japanese parachute
invasion of Palembang on Feb. 14, 1942 and it's possible I may need to see
records there since the US Navy was part of the combined
British-Dutch-French-US command in that area. If so, I'll be shure to pass
along any experiences that I might have. I certainly hope to arrange an
actual trip to Palembang in a couple of years. But I digress...

I've seen a couple and there are *lots* of references to the various manuals
(and I think every wanna be professional soldier in the last 500 years has
written one at some point) in the various readings I do studying tactical
combat techniques but that doesn't make me an expert by any stretch
of the imagination. The very fact that there are so many and so many were
never accepted (quality?) means even they are by no means a final reference.
I would like to know if there were exceptions or even who wrote the first
manual with 'lock and load'...
Yuck, I had a house fire going on 3 years ago now. Every time I smell a
bar-b-q pit I remember it...;(
I've seen that sort of behaviour as well. I've tried to demonstrate the pipe
model and truth be told, it works only about 9 out of 10 times. Black powder
just ain't that unstable.

I don't know whether I should feel blessed or cursed now....I spent several
hours today clearing the yard (covered in grass) of tree limbs that were
knocked down from the storm last week and in preperation for the storm to
come in to town tomorrow...still have to mow that green stuff since it's
getting a tad tall...maybe this weekend.
Personaly, I can't imagine why anyone would allow them to build a city
without parks and grass and trees and such. Hell, we have laws in Austin
that make such things mandatory...there is currently a big fight going on
about 'Triangle Park' here in Austin between leaving the 50+ acres at N.
Lamar, Guadalupe, & 45th alone or selling to make a movie theatre and
parking lot. Looks like the trees are gonna win this one...I know my dog
certainly likes romping in the mud puddles...(I live about 10 blocks away)
So big bucks don't always win and the city & state (the park is owned by
the state hospital and currently houses some sort of juvenile center in
one small corner) governments do sometimes listen to the people of a
neighborhood over commercial interests.
Money is not more important than trees sometimes & government sometimes
does listen...

Right mounted safety? Sounds like a lefties gun. Safeties are usualy thumb
tripped which means they are on the left. The idea is you can safety the
weapon without taking your finger from the trigger. That could explain the
loading problem, guns built for lefties typicaly have all kinds of weird
handling issues. It sounds to me like a real nightmare to load and use in
the bush since you have to take your hand off the gun in order to get the
safety off while you load another round while cycling the bolt through its
action - eliminates snap shots that's for shure. Do you know if it is a
lefty build? If so then it clearly isn't a military grade weapon since they
are ubiquitously designed for right handed firers (at least until the last
20 yrs. or so).
Once the clip is in place, top feed since you said "push down", does the
safety prevent the cycling of ammo through the breech? Does it use a
stripper clip or a carrier? You don't happen to know the type of action?
Is this a military grade weapon or sport?
Interesting since the 1911 I use doesn't exhibit this ... I don't
have a problem loading it irrespecitive of the safety. If the safety is on
the hammer is blocked from the bottem by a lever. You can put ammo in it,
cock it via the slide, etc. Just can't pull the trigger. Will have to look
more into this...
Thanks for the info.
Merry Christmas!

I would go for a HK 93 or G3 model myself w/ Zeiss 3x9 scope w/ some sort of
laser designator for long range (> 200 yds.). Chambered in .308 and will give
about a 4 to 6-in. group at 600 yds. from what I have seen - very handy for
shooting throug 4 in. brick walls as well. Very accurate (a very popular
sniper weapon) and more than forgiving with the environment. It's little
brother the MP-5 pretty much owns the SWAT and similar sorts of jobs.
A Desert Eagle chambered in .357 (you just *think* those .223 go through
vests) would be my close in choice.
Course you ain't gonna touch the HK for less than a few $k and the Desert
Eagles are over $1k.
Don't worry about it - go with a HK and you can fill the chamber with gunk
and the next cycle of the blowback bolt system will clear it. Excellent all
weather weapon. It'll even fire if un-oiled - not something you should do
with a M16/AR15.

This doesn't use a Mauser 1898 action does it? The top feed 5-round clip is
my first clue...
As to first semi-automatic in the country, I believe  the Springfield 1903
has that particular honor. It used a Mauser '98 action also. It's also where
.30-06 got the 06 from...also very popular in WW1 and used as a sniper rifle
through Normandy, after which the Garand pretty much took over.
How can that work if the R. thumb is on the L. side of the gun while the
safety is on the R. side of the gun? Your description leaves me with one of
two mental images. Either my hand is off the trigger guard and I have a loaded
and unsafed weapon or else I have to do some sort of finger gynmastics
around the trigger guard in the same unsafed condition. Scares the be-jesus
out of me...an errant twig could fire a round.
Yep, bet this is some sort of Mauser '98 action...
We're supposed to get rain and more rain starting tomorrow. They say it might
be clear on Christmas but the rain returns on Friday...;(
Stay warm & thanks for the discussion.

Military and police snipers the world over differ strongly with you...
Beside, it's the 93/G3 not the 91 (thought they do share a lot of commen base
pieces) that is the sniper rifle. I believe you will also find that the .308
is the base caliber for all versions. Your wording above would indicate the
91 was .308 while the 93 was a different caliber, this is incorrect. Visit
the H&K home page...
Really? Watch a few more of those silly police shows on at night. Pay
particular attention to the long-term hostage episodes. I generaly see the
break-in team carrying MP-5 or shortie M-16's. I have yet to see the backup
or sniper team using a bolt-action. Learning base tactics is about the only
thing these shows are good for.
I only use them for long-range shots and it does require the scope to see
the spot - the whole point really. The idea is the beam is of very low power
at this point and doesn't stand out quite as bad as up close (the glowing
red dot).
Bad news, the others guys IR/IIS will spot you in a heart-beat, never use a
laser at nite, it's like tracers - they work both ways. You want to stick
with a strictly 3rd generation passive IR/IIS.
Remember, we're counter-sniping at this point...

True enough.
There wasn't a distinction until the 1920's when the various 'gat' laws
because of gangsters, rum runners and such came into play.
I have a friend who is a gun collector. I 'll see if he happens to have one.
I wanna see this safety...
Merry Christmas!

There is a historical problem w/ the accredation of the various signals in
use during the Civil War in the book:
The author claims (from John Young's cydisk.htm):
 Myer, Albert (1829-1880), U S. Army surgeon and cryptographer. To
finance his medical studies, Myer worked as an operator for the New York,
Albany, and Buffalo Telegraph Company. After entering the army, he developed
a visual signaling method in 1856 and called it flag telegraphy. (Two British
officers, Sir Francis Bolton and Vice Adm. Philip Colomb, independently developed
a similar system at about the same time.) Though it was approved for use
in 1860, the year Myer became chief signal officer, the system was not fully
appreciated until the outbreak of the U.S. CIVIL WAR in 1861. Myer's technique
then came to be known as "wigwag," from the motions of its hand-held flags
or disks for daytime signaling and torches or lanterns for sending messages
at night.
This is clearly several errors regarding 'wig-wag' signaling techniques and
Myer. These techniques go back to pre-Napoleonic times. Myers was a alphabetic
system where arm position denoted the letter, not the arm motion (hence
The American Civil War and the Origins of Modern Warfare
Edward Hagerman
pp. 40
"But the primary motive was recognition  of the benefits of this technology
to tactical and strategic coordination. The increasingly extended lines of
large American armies, especially  their tactical extension with the rifled
musket, as well as the rough terrain, challenged existing technology based
on wigwag signals supplemented by couriers."
In addition, McClellan didn't appoint Myer to be his signal officer until
August 20, 1861. Further, there was *no* signals department in the US Army
to be appointed to until *after* March 3, 1863 when legislation was passed
bringing the official Signal Corp. into being.
I don't have clue what Wrixon is talking about, but it clearly doesn't
have anything to do with history in general or crypto specificaly.
Cite this Wrixon's book with care.

Content-Length: 1714      Hi all,
There was a power failure in my area this evening, a power transformer blew
from the sound I heard just as the power went out. After verifying the UPS
would keep the system up at least 20 minutes I shut the whole thing down.
The system seems to be back up at this time except for a problem with the
eth1 interface. I believe this is related to a glitch and will be working on
it over the next few minutes. The system may be a bit unstable because I
will need to reboot at least once...
Sorry for any inconvenience.

Hi Doug,
Forwarded message:
Which needs to have access to at least *all* incoming requests for data as
well as a channel to other switchboard sites so they can catalog those
requests and won't have to look them up more than once, after that they
simply use the request as a key to a index of sources.
I suspect all the traffic would need to be encrypted to get this to work
well. The channels between the switchboards and the databanks also need to
be encrypted in such a manner that it is transparent even to the operators
what the keys are at any given time. Also, assuming the user provides a
request to a switchboard, who then determines the correct server through
some mechanism, contacts that databank server and requests a transmission,
and finaly the databank server sends the data to the user. How do we track
the various keys and verify that the user making the request is the user
getting the data? Is the switchboard and databank servers simply tracking
the key provided by the original request sufficient?
What you need is a pick-and-place system. It would consist of a handling
mechanism, a burning mechanism, a jukebox mechanism, and a CD storage
mechanism. Personaly I wouldn't want them all in one in case any one broke
down the rest of the system could still keep working.
Valuable to who? For how long? Who pays for the stack of CD's up front? What
kind of amortization schedule are we looking at for paybacks? Since we are
looking at a automated system, what does 'offline' mean when the
pick-and-place goes over to the rack and pulls the CD to place in the
jukebox and it is now online? How do we charge the user?
Yeah, mixmaster does something similar to this. The problem I have with
mixmaster is that the sender has to set up the chaining and keys and such.
There simply isn't a clear mechanism (as I understand mixmaster) to do this
transparently. One look at the chaining file that is required is enough to
explain why granny doesn't use chained mixmaster remailers.
Now if we want to do it in the protocol stack then we have a problem because
it isn't supported in the standard.
What I would do is a little different. An example...
Let's assume we have 4 remailers, A to D. The sender sends a packet to A
that's header is in the clear. Once A gets it, addressed to an appropriate
user to invoke the decryption process, it decrypts the body of the packet.
What it assumes is there is another valid packet with unencrypted header
which it passes on to B. B gets it and de-crypts it and passes it on. This
happens in C and D as well. At no point does any of the processes need to do
anything other than use its own key to decrypt. If that fails the packet is
trashed. Since no information about its previous source was passed to D from
C this failure won't propogate back up the chain, providing a measure of
source security. D takes the packet, whose body is still encrypted and
remails it to the next address in the header, in this example the actual
The issue for me is how do the remailers handle the pass-off. Here are a
few of the choices:
 -  the existing mechanism which is completely dependant on the user and
    their technical skill. I don't like this one, too people intensive.
 -  the sender does it by reference to a key-server and automated chaining
    software. The software would ask for a sequence of available remailers
    from the user, go off to the key-server and get the appropriate keys,
    and create the nested encrypted packets. Then it only has to send them
    on their way. Still a tad too technical for granny I suspect.
 -  the sender provides a source destination and a number of remailers. The
    software goes to the key-server, looks up the available remailers
    (hopefuly there are more than the number requested by the sender) and
    selects the appropriate number through some mechanism (PRNG is my
    choice). It then creates the chained packet and sends it on its way.
    I suspect granny could deal with this one, she knows how to count and
    has sonnie's email address in her mailer software.
What I like about this is the key server represents a mechanism for income.
It would cost say $1/month to store your key on the server and then anyone
who made the request would get it. The key would automaticaly age and expire
if the user didn't keep paying the fee. Further, there would be no
distinction between remailers, users, or other processes as to the actual
key. It would consist of a list similar to:
 :::
for example:
ravage at ssz.com:12/30/98:PGP:3$ at DDcq*
(note that some sort of escape mechanism needs to be included so that :'s
 can be used in keys as well. I put the actual key last. That way I know
 that any : after the encryption_protocol is a part of the key.)
I would have to make requests of the sort:
ravage at ssz.com:*
Where '*' would return a complete listing for that ID of all registered
So to use it I would send an email with the key request(s) in the body
one to a line and sent it to 'key-server at ssz.com'. The key-server would
return something like:
ravage at ssz.com:*
ravage at ssz.com:12/30/98:PGP:
Now there is a problem if the key is multi-part. To handle those I would put
each key part on a seperate line:
ravage at ssz.com:12/30/98:Multi-Key:23$
ravage at ssz.com:12/30/98:Multi-Key:4dseP2*!
So what you would end up with is:
Hope that helps. If you use the key server idea as I am explaining it please
make shure I get credit for it. As far as I am aware nobody else is using a
system similar, nor has one been proposed by other parties. If you find this
is an error on my part please let me know.

Section 4.  The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. [Clearly congressmen are responsible for their actions while in office since
they are civil officers. It looks like all it should take to remove a civil
officer is a misdemeanor such as speeding.]
Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; -- to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; -- to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; -- to Controversies between two or more States; -- between a State and Citizens of another State; -- between Citizens of different States; -- between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States; -- and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. [Note that there is no federal jurisdiction for sueing your own
representatives at the federal level since they are citizens of your own
state, however you *can* sue the representatives of the *other* 49 states
for their actions and that *is* a federal level case]
Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.  In all other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. [Clearly any such claims *must* be at the level of the Supreme Court since
they hold original jurisdiction, further there doesn't seem to be any
mechanism they can refuse to handle the case]
by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. [Since the breaking of the oath to uphold the Constitution while a
representative is a impeachable offence no jury is required. Once the case
is before the Supreme Court then the Congress is required to set the time
and date]
The question of the day is:
How does one go about submitting a case directly to the Supreme Court? The
Constitution apparently leaves this up to the Supreme Court to decide in its
rules of operation.

Forwarded message:
The quotes from the Constitution, which you apparently didn't read, clearly
indicate that the role of the Supreme Court is more than a simple appeals
court. Further, while they may refuse to hear appeals, hence confirming the
lower courts ruling with a supreme stamp of approval, there is *nothing* in
the Constitution and hence their rules that allows them to refuse to accept
cases where they are the only Constitutional jurisdiction, such as
impeachment proceedings of Congressmen relating to un-constitutional actions
that may result in their impeachment.
Once the case is submitted to the Supreme Court then Congress, not the SC,
chooses the place and time.

SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S. - RULES
      ..Part IV. Other Jurisdiction
     _________________________________________________________________
    Rule 17. Procedure in an Original Action
     * 1. This Rule applies only to an action invoking the Court's
       original jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution of the
       United States. See also 28 U. S. C. �1251 and U. S. Const., Amdt.
       11. A petition for an extraordinary writ in aid of the Court's
       appellate jurisdiction shall be filed as provided in Rule 20.
     * 2. The form of pleadings and motions prescribed by the Federal
       Rules of Civil Procedure is followed. In other respects, those
       Rules and the Federal Rules of Evidence may be taken as guides.
     * 3. The initial pleading shall be preceded by a motion for leave to
       file, and may be accompanied by a brief in support of the motion.
       Forty copies of each document shall be filed, with proof of
       service. Service shall be as required by Rule 29, except that when
       an adverse party is a State, service shall be made on both the
       Governor and the Attorney General of that State.
     * 4. The case will be placed on the docket when the motion for leave
       to file and the initial pleading are filed with the Clerk. The
       Rule 38(a) docket fee shall be paid at that time.
     * 5. No more than 60 days after receiving the motion for leave to
       file and the initial pleading, an adverse party shall file 40
       copies of any brief in opposition to the motion, with proof of
       service as required by Rule 29. The Clerk will distribute the
       filed documents to the Court for its consideration upon receiving
       an express waiver of the right to file a brief in opposition, or,
       if no waiver or brief is filed, upon the expiration of the time
       allowed for filing. If a brief in opposition is timely filed, the
       Clerk will distribute the filed documents to the Court for its
       consideration no less than 10 days after the brief in opposition
       is filed. A reply brief may be filed, but consideration of the
       case will not be deferred pending its receipt. The Court
       thereafter may grant or deny the motion, set it for oral argument,
       direct that additional documents be filed, or require that other
       proceedings be conducted.
     * 6. A summons issued out of this Court shall be served on the
       defendant 60 days before the return day specified therein. If the
       defendant does not respond by the return day, the plaintiff may
       proceed ex parte.
     * 7. Process against a State issued out of this Court shall be
       served on both the Governor and the Attorney General of that
       State.

Article III
   Section 1. The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in
   one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may
   from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the
   supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good
   behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a
   compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance
   in office.
   Section 2. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and
   equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United
   States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
   authority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers
   and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to
   controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to
   controversies between two or more states;--between a state and
   citizens of another state;--between citizens of different
   states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under
   grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens
   thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.
   In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
   consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court
   shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before
   mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both
   as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations
   as the Congress shall make.
   The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by
   jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes
   shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state,
   the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law
   have directed.
   Section 3. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in
   levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them
   aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the
   testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in
   open court.
   The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason,

SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S. - RULES
      ..Part VII. Practice and Procedure
     _________________________________________________________________
    Rule 29. Filing and Service of Documents; Special Notifications; Corporate
    Listing
     * 1. Any document required or permitted to be presented to the Court
       or to a Justice shall be filed with the Clerk.
     * 2. A document is timely filed if it is sent to the Clerk through
       the United States Postal Service by first-class mail (including
       express or priority mail), postage prepaid, and bears a postmark
       showing that the document was mailed on or before the last day for
       filing. Commercial postage meter labels alone are not acceptable.
       If submitted by an inmate confined in an institution, a document
       is timely filed if it is deposited in the institution's internal
       mail system on or before the last day for filing and is
       accompanied by a notarized statement or declaration in compliance
       with 28 U. S. C. �1746 setting out the date of deposit and stating
       that first-class postage has been prepaid. If the postmark is
       missing or not legible, the Clerk will require the person who
       mailed the document to submit a notarized statement or declaration
       in compliance with 28 U. S. C. �1746 setting out the details of
       the mailing and stating that the mailing took place on a
       particular date within the permitted time. A document also is
       timely filed if it is forwarded through a private delivery or
       courier service and is actually received by the Clerk within the
       time permitted for filing.
     * 3. Any document required by these Rules to be served may be served
       personally or by mail on each party to the proceeding at or before
       the time of filing. If the document has been prepared as required
       by Rule 33.1, three copies shall be served on each other party
       separately represented in the proceeding. If the document has been
       prepared as required by Rule 33.2, service of a single copy on
       each other separately represented party suffices. If personal
       service is made, it shall consist of delivery at the office of the
       counsel of record, either to counsel or to an employee therein. If
       service is by mail, it shall consist of depositing the document
       with the United States Postal Service, with no less than
       first-class postage prepaid, addressed to counsel of record at the
       proper post office address. When a party is not represented by
       counsel, service shall be made on the party, personally or by
       mail.
     * 4. (a) If the United States or any federal department, office,
       agency, officer, or employee is a party to be served, service
       shall be made on the Solicitor General of the United States, Room
       5614, Department of Justice, 10th St. and Constitution Ave., N.
       W., Washington, DC 20530. When an agency of the United States that
       is a party is authorized by law to appear before this Court on its
       own behalf, or when an officer or employee of the United States is
       a party, the agency, officer, or employee shall be served in
       addition to the Solicitor General.
          + (b) In any proceeding in this Court in which the
            constitutionality of an Act of Congress is drawn into
            question, and neither the United States nor any federal
            department, office, agency, officer, or employee is a party,
            the initial document filed in this Court shall recite that 28
            U. S. C. �2403(a) may apply and shall be served on the
            Solicitor General of the United States, Room 5614, Department
            of Justice, 10th St. and Constitution Ave., N. W.,
            Washington, DC 20530. In such a proceeding from any court of
            the United States, as defined by 28 U. S. C. �451, the
            initial document also shall state whether that court,
            pursuant to 28 U. S. C. �2403(a), certified to the Attorney
            General the fact that the constitutionality of an Act of
            Congress was drawn into question. See Rule 14.1(e)(v).
          + (c) In any proceeding in this Court in which the
            constitutionality of any statute of a State is drawn into
            question, and neither the State nor any agency, officer, or
            employee thereof is a party, the initial document filed in
            this Court shall recite that 28 U. S. C. �2403(b) may apply
            and shall be served on the Attorney General of that State. In
            such a proceeding from any court of the United States, as
            defined by 28 U. S. C. �451, the initial document also shall
            state whether that court, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. �2403(b),
            certified to the State Attorney General the fact that the
            constitutionality of a statute of that State was drawn into
            question. See Rule 14.1(e)(v).
     * 5. Proof of service, when required by these Rules, shall accompany
       the document when it is presented to the Clerk for filing and
       shall be separate from it. Proof of service shall contain, or be
       accompanied by, a statement that all parties required to be served
       have been served, together with a list of the names, addresses,
       and telephone numbers of counsel indicating the name of the party
       or parties each counsel represents. It is not necessary that
       service on each party required to be served be made in the same
       manner or evidenced by the same proof. Proof of service may
       consist of any one of the following:
          + (a) an acknowledgment of service, signed by counsel of record
            for the party served;
          + (b) a certificate of service, reciting the facts and
            circumstances of service in compliance with the appropriate
            paragraph or paragraphs of this Rule, and signed by a member
            of the Bar of this Court representing the party on whose
            behalf service is made or by an attorney appointed to
            represent that party under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964,
            see 18 U. S. C. �3006A(d)(6), or under any other applicable
            federal statute; or
          + (c) a notarized affidavit or declaration in compliance with
            28 U. S. C. �1746, reciting the facts and circumstances of
            service in accordance with the appropriate paragraph or
            paragraphs of this Rule, whenever service is made by any
            person not a member of the Bar of this Court and not an
            attorney appointed to represent a party under the Criminal
            Justice Act of 1964, see 18 U. S. C. �3006A(d)(6), or under
            any other applicable federal statute.
     * 6. Every document, except a joint appendix or amicus curiae brief,
       filed by or on behalf of one or more corporations shall list all
       parent companies and nonwholly owned subsidiaries of each of the
       corporate filers. If there is no parent or subsidiary company to
       be listed, a notation to this effect shall be included in the
       document. If a list has been included in a document filed earlier
       in the case, reference may be made to the earlier document (except
       when the earlier list appeared in an application for an extension
       of time or for a stay), and only amendments to the list to make it
       current need be included in the document being filed.

                   CLINTON ADVISER: NO MAJOR TAX CUT IN 1998
   Tax Cut
   WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, Dec. 28) -- President Bill Clinton will not
   propose any across-the-board tax cut or push for any major overhaul of
   the tax system in his 1998 budget, a senior White House adviser said
   Sunday.
   But speaking on NBC's "Meet The Press," Rahm Emanuel also said that
   Clinton would not necessarily veto any tax cut sent to the White House
   by Congress, provided it didn't bust an existing spending agreement
   that would balance the budget by 2002.
   "If others have an approach, we'd love to see it," he said. "(But)
   where are they going to pay for it? Are they talking about cuts in
   health care? Are they talking about cuts in senior programs?"
   Some Wall Street analysts have forecast a surplus of as much as $40
   billion in the current fiscal year, which runs through September 30 --
   a surplus that proponents of a tax cut say could be used to pay for
   it. Emanuel
   But Emanuel said the White House believes that no decisions about what
   to do with the surplus should be made until a surplus actually
   materializes.
   "Washington should not return to its bad habits of spending money it
   doesn't have," he said. "That's what got us into trouble in the first
   place in the 1980s."
   In addition to tax cuts, a number of Republicans, including House
   Majority Leader Dick Armey and 1996 presidential candidate Steve
   Forbes, have also proposed so-called "flat tax" plans that would
   radically alter the income tax system. Others want to replace income
   tax entirely with a national sales tax.
   Even Democratic House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt has a modified
   "flat tax" plan that would simplify the system and reduce tax rates
   for middle and lower income taxpayers.
   But Sunday, Emanuel made it clear the White House wasn't looking to
   make any such radical changes in the tax code in 1998.
   "We finally have gotten the deficit under wraps and lifted it off the
   back of the economy," he said. "We shouldn't do anything reckless or
   irresponsible."
   However, Clinton will propose new tax credits targeted toward helping
   middle-class families pay for child care, Emanuel said.

                   JOHN PAUL GETTY II NOW A BRITISH CITIZEN
     December 28, 1997
     Web posted at: 9:58 p.m. EST (0258 GMT)
     LONDON (AP) -- American billionaire John Paul Getty II is an
     American no longer.
     The London Sunday Telegraph says the philanthropist has become a
     British citizen and revoked his U.S. citizenship. Sources in the
     British government confirm the move.
     Getty is 65 and has lived in Britain for 25 years. During that time,
     he's become one of the country's major benefactors. In 1986, he even
     received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.
     The Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest Americans estimates
     Getty's fortune at $1 billion.

@_subject: Guns: H&K, G3, 7.62 v 5.56 [Guns] 
I finaly got around to doing some research on Tim's claim regarding H&K's G3
being a 5.56 round while the various folks I have been talking to refer to
it as a 7.62.
Tim's claim that the 7.62 (.308) is actualy the HK-91/G1 and not the G3 is
correct. The confusion comes from the fact that a few years ago the German
Bundswehr quit using the HK and began using the FN/G3 which is 7.62. I had
assumed the G3 it was refering to was the H&K and when I talked to the local
gun nut he thought I was talking about the current model because I had made
a comment a while back about it being used by the Germans as their standard
infantry model and being .308.
H&K 91/G1 is 7.62 (.308) (old standard issue)
H&K 93/G3 is 5.56 (.223)
FN/G3 is 7.62 (.308) (current standard issue)
My suggested rifle *is* the H&K 91/G1 which is .308 and the local gun shop
says used they run in the $1500 to $3000 range. New ones aren't imported.

So what you are saying, though I doubt you realize it, is that a citizen
*can't* sue 2 or more states as a group. They *must* sue singly and in the
individual state courts.
Of course, this isn't explicity described either, so where does this
authority come from?
This means there is no way to sue states as a group for their actions in
regards to relations to the federal government. So the federal government
can require the states to do all kinds of things and I as a citizen and
effected by those actions can't sue the states but only the federal
Interesting hole. I wonder if it will hold up.

@_subject: Right to sue multiple states... 
Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;
[deleted text]
between Citizens of different States;
[deleted text]
Clearly my suing say the govenor and legislature of each of the 50 states
qualifies as a case involving citizens of different states and therefore
there is clearly a right to sue multiple states at the federal level and
falls under the responsibility of the Supreme Court.

Really? Where is that in the Constitution? I can't sue a state or the
federal government on an issue of process or procedure unless I *personaly*
have been effected? Malarky. The simple fact that I am a citizen that
*could* be effected is sufficient grounds to file. Especialy considering the
detailing of authority in the 10th.
If this were so I would not be able to file against a law regulating, for
example, a religion unless I happen to be a participant of that religion.
This is clearly not constitutional since any law threating a single
religion by extension can and does threaten all religious freedom in the
Why? If both states are participating in an illegal action - such as
complying with unconstitutional federal regulations - then even a single
state in which I *don't* reside nor have *ever* been in is a clear threat to
my constitutional rights.  Remember the feds are *required* to guarantee a
constitutional government in *all* states and that all priviliges and
immunitites be recognized by those states - irrespective of my current
geographic location. Now if we accept the argument that the 14th extends my
federal rights to the states then the wrongful action and its application is
even more clearly relevant. However, the 14th is not necessary for this to
be the case.
(thankfuly, since one of my claims is that rights are not equivalent to
priviliges or immunities)
It is the precedence and not the personal application that is
- Illegal taxation and the compliance of the states in turning over money
  illegaly
- regulation and prohibition of firearms and the states complicancy
  in breaking the 2nd.
- the provisioning and support of military operations relating to the
  Army and Air Force (which is unconstitutional unless part of the Army
  or Navy) for more than 2 year terms.
- the failure of the US govt. to train and arm the militia in the several
  states
- the various federal regulations limiting consensual crimes contrary
  to the letter and spirit of the 9th and 10th.
- the abrogation of the states duties as equals to the federal govt.
  and their duties as a part of the checks and balances of the
  Constitution.
And as a matter of course most other issues resting on Constitutional
jurisdiction involving the willing compliance of state government.
Nobody that I can find has *ever* even tried to do this so how can it be
undoable? It's a pity there wasn't some young turk back then to give it a
shot - course there doesn't seem to be any young turks now willing to do it
Now, if I can figure a way around the Supreme Courts 3 year requirement...

We are talking about suing an individual for their actions in their official
capacity. People sign bills not offices. People commit crimes, offices
I can find nothing in the Constitution that prohibits this, and since the
10th limits the feds authority by extension it is permissible.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1.  The judicial Power of the United States, shall be invested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.
Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; -- to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;
Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.
by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearly the Constitution allows charges against individuals for their actions
while in office. Otherwise how would anyone be impeached?
The person holding an office is responsible for all actions of that office
and are in fact *personaly* responsible for those actions.

@_subject: Sniping & such... 
To address Tim's question about bolt-actions. As far as I know the Marine
sniper still uses the Remington 7.62 bolt-action as his arm of choice. The
beauty of the H&K blow-back mechanism is that it is very accurate at long
range compared to other gas operated mechanism.
However, in the situation we are discussion - taking on an assault team with
snipers, aka anti-sniping, this level of accuracy is irrelevant. The goal is
to stop the assault. To this end single shot accuracy is irrelevant. The
reason is that we are not trying to hit a 16 in.^2 piece of brain pan and
*not* hit the hostage in front. What we *are* trying to do is locate and
eliminate specific targets and any ancillary hits to personnel on that end
are a *good* thing. To that end I still like the H&K's because they have
the 3-shot selector. My goal would be to set my IIS to show hot targets as
black, with the black threshold about 90F. I would then pop off a 3-shot
group into anything that looked the least bit like a person. Think of it as
a .308 mini-shotgun at 600 yds. Under those conditions a 6-12 in. spread
*is* a good thing. With this in mind, you would want to wear nomex to reduce your heat
signature, a gillie suit for reduced visual targeting, and some sort of cool
suit (from your local auto performance shop) with a modified and remote
dissipator to reduce your heat signature so that *their* scopes don't show
you as black. If you're in your house a good place to put the dissipator
would be in the bathtub or sink. You might also want to cool-suit the gun as
well. If you're in the field the dissipator should go behind and below your
level of site, it's probably a good thing to cover it with dirt or debris as

When in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.      We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such Principles and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of Abuses and Ursurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not exactly. States have the sovereignty *given* them by the Constitution
and their individual state constitutions. Further, one state can *not* under
the Constitution deny me a right in that state that I have in another.
Perhaps an example. The 2nd gives me the right to bear arms. Texas'
constitution gives the Texas legislature the right to regulate the ownership
and carrying of arms by Texas *citizens*. Those same laws could *not* be
used to deny a citizen of Louisiana from carrying their weapon if *their*
constitution does not regulate such activities.
It isn't *my* logic Bill, it's the Constitutions law:
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. It goes like this:
 -  A question of jurisdiction is noted.
 -  The Constitution is examined to see if it is assigned to the federal
    government.
 -  If it isn't then we look to see if the Constitution denies that power
    to the states. If not then the individual states may impliment it as
    *their* constitutions allow, provided it does not break any of the
    Constitutions dicta about equal protection and recognition.
 -  If the state constitution doesn't cover it *or* it is denied to the
    states by the Constitution then we each get to decide it on our own
    by our own means.

So your premise is that the changes that were implimented at the time of the
Constitution were all the changes that the founding fathers had in mind? You
hold that while it is clear that the founding fathers recognized that the
quantity of change required was such that they would not be able to
impliment it realisticaly since nobody would accept that range of change at
one time? You further hold that the Constitution is not a document that holds
an ideal of freedom for us which will require generations of striving? You
seriously expect to get up one morning and find that no new laws will be
needed and that we have solved all the issues respecting human interaction?
You further hold that with 200+ years of English jurisprudence behind us we
have actualy attained that nirvana?
In short, you would have us take it all - the good and the bad - and ignore
our right to pick and choose what works for us?
If we accept your view, blacks would still be slaves and women would still
not be able to vote, and men couldn't vote unless they were landed.
Do me a favor, please don't try to lick my hand.

Your lack of ability to comprehend english and extrapolate to the fantastic is
truly amazing. You should consider turning it into a money maker. Either
that or you're having a breakdown, see a shrink. Maybe they can do something
about these visions you're seeing.
Happy New Year!

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL23]
Content-Length: 2281      I was playing with my dog Reef today in the yard. The postal carrier came up
and she went over to investigate, barking as usual. The postal carrier
responded by kicking at her and waving mail in her face all the while
getting closer and closer. This did nothing to calm her down. I tried to talk
to the guy while restraining the dog, who was crouched down on all fours in a
defensive position, but he just walked off without a word. I went down to the
post office and filed a complaint. The supervisor at the post office asked me
whether he had struck the dog and when I explained that had he struck the dog
or tried to mace her I would have struck the carrier and taken him to the
police station, he got defensive and began threatening me with federal action.
I explained that was fine with me, let's do it.
It's amazing that federal employees believe they can come on private property,
vandalize it with immunity, and if you attempt to defend yourself then you
are the one in the wrong.
I can't wait till/if the postal rep calls back on the mail-in complaint form
I sent off today...

Too Far
  Rep. Paul's comments about Waco irresponsible
   U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, said on C-SPAN that he lived in fear
   of being "bombed by the federal government in another Waco." Paul has
   embarrassed himself, his constituents and the state of Texas.
   The congressman needs to put aside his hysteria long enough to
   remember the facts of the standoff between federal agents and the
   Branch Davidians:
   Members of the cult gunned down federal agents who had come to serve a
   search warrant at the Davidian compound, which they accurately
   believed to contain automatic weapons and other illegal armaments.
   Before that, the group's leader had sexually assaulted several
   children of his followers.
   The FBI allowed the group weeks to lay down its arms and surrender.
   Some members and their children did surrender and received every
   consideration from authorities; others set fire to their own building,
   causing the deaths of 81 people, including 25 children.
   Paul is wrong to state that the government bombed the Davidians and to
   imply further that Americans should fear that their lives might be
   ended any moment by murderous, renegade federal law enforcement
   officers. His irresponsible remarks encourage the irrational fears
   that were the root cause of the Davidian tragedy and make similar
   confrontations more likely.
   Rep. Chet Edwards of Waco perhaps had the best advice for Paul. If the
   congressman really fears he will be bombed by federal agents, he
   should leave Washington.

X-within-URL:     Court TV Library   Justice Thomas on 'Heroes and Victims'
    Legal Times
   Clarence Thomas may keep a lower profile than many of his colleagues
   on the Supreme Court bench. But when he does speak out, he almost
   always makes an impact. That was the case late last month, when Thomas
   made headlines with a speech excoriating what he termed "the modern
   ideology of victimhood."
   In his remarks, delivered to the Federalist Society's Ninth Annual
   Lawyers Convention, Thomas criticized contemporary society for
   exalting victims -- in not only the political realm, but in the courts
   as well. He marveled at the breadth and depth of the victim mentality,
   finding irony in the white men today who, "preoccupied with
   oppression," have "fallen prey to the very aspects of the modern
   ideology of victimology that they deplore." And, sounding a classic
   conservative theme, Thomas concluded that "the idea that government
   can be the primary instrument for the elimination of misfortune is a
   fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition."
   The full text of Thomas' speech, delivered Sept. 22 in Washington,
   D.C., follows. It is reprinted with permission.
     _________________________________________________________________
   I would like thank my friends here at the Federalist Society for once
   again inviting me to be a part of an important and timely conference.
   And I would like to begin by returning to a topic I touched upon in my
   last speech at a conference co-sponsored by this organization:
   personal responsibility. It says something about the current state of
   affairs in our society that a conference on victims -- that is, a
   conference on the rise of the practice of blaming circumstances for
   one's situation rather than taking responsibility for changing things
   for the better -- is even necessary.
   As many of you have heard me say before, the very notion of submitting
   to one's circumstances was unthinkable in the household in which I was
   raised. The mere suggestion that difficult circumstances could prevail
   over individual effort would evoke a response that my brother and I
   could lip-sync on cue: "Old man 'can't' is dead; I helped bury him."
   Or, another favorite response: "Where there is a will, there is a
   way." Under this philosophy -- the essential truth of which we all
   recognize in our hearts -- victims have no refuge.
   It may have seemed harsh at the time to be told that failure was one's
   own fault. Indeed, there may have been many circumstances beyond our
   control. But there was much that my family and my community did to
   reinforce this message of self-determination and self-worth, thereby
   inoculating us against the victim plague that was highly contagious in
   the hot, humid climate of segregation.
   What has become clear to me over the years, as I have witnessed the
   transformation of our society into one based upon victims rather than
   heroes, is that there is a more positive message to be gained from
   adversity: Success (as well as failure) is the result of one's own
   talents, morals, decisions, and actions. Accepting personal
   responsibility for victory as well as for defeat is as liberating and
   empowering as it is unpopular today. Overcoming adversity not only
   gives us our measure as individuals, but it also reinforces those
   basic principles and rules without which a society based upon freedom
   and liberty cannot function.
   In those years of my youth, there was a deep appreciation of heroes
   and heroic virtue. Art, literature, and even popular culture (unlike
   today) often focused on people who demonstrated heroic virtues --
   courage, persistence, discipline, hard work, humility, triumph in the
   face of adversity, just to mention a few. These building blocks of
   self-reliance were replicated and reinforced at home, school, and
   church. The "rags to riches" Horatio Alger stories were powerful
   messages of hope and inspiration to those struggling for a better
   life. And many of us used to read and dream about heroes -- not to
   mention our favorite television heroes, something perhaps unbelievable
   these days. I am certain that many of you who attended grammar school
   in the 1950s or earlier probably remember reading a favorite account
   of the integrity and work ethic of George Washington, or of Abraham
   Lincoln, or of George Washington Carver, or even of some baseball or
   football legend. It seemed that we all had heroes (not role models, a
   term of far more recent vintage). Indeed, it would have been odd for a
   child of several decades ago not to have had a hero.
   But today, our culture is far less likely to raise up heroes than it
   is to exalt victims -- individuals who are overcome by the sting of
   oppression, injustice, adversity, neglect, or misfortune. Today,
   victims of discrimination, racism, poverty, sickness, and societal
   neglect abound in the popular press. Today, there are few (if any)
   heroes. Often, it seems that those who have succumbed to their
   circumstances are more likely to be singled out than those who have
   overcome them.
   What caused this cultural shift -- from an emphasis on heroes to a
   preoccupation with victims? Why are there more victims and virtually
   no heroes recognized today? Why in years past was there much less of
   an emphasis on victimage?
   I think two things contributed to this change in the state of affairs.
   The first is that our political and legal systems now actively
   encourage people to claim victim status and to make demands on society
   for reparations and recompense. The second is that our culture
   actually seeks to denigrate or deconstruct heroes. Why would a
   civilized society travel down two such destructive paths? Why has it
   become no more admirable to rise valiantly above one's circumstances
   than it is to submit to them -- all the while aggressively
   transferring responsibility for one's condition to others?
   Let's begin with our political and legal systems -- how have they
   contributed to this state of affairs? The classical conception was
   that government and the law were meant to ensure freedom and equality
   of opportunity by giving people the most room possible for
   self-provision and self-determination. James Madison made this point
   in The Federalist Papers when he observed that the "protection" of the
   "diversity of faculties in men" was the "first object" of government.
   And, in more recent times, the great political economist Friedrich von
   Hayek -- who witnessed totalitarianism first-hand -- made a similar
   point when he observed that "the chief aim of freedom is to provide
   both the opportunity and the inducement to insure the maximum use of
   the knowledge that an individual can acquire."
   Between the New Deal and the 1960s, a far different view began to hold
   sway -- namely, that the role of the state was to eliminate want,
   suffering, and adversity. Freedom was no longer simply a right to
   self-provision and self-determination, but was instead a right to make
   demands on government and society for one's well-being and happiness.
   That is the import of Franklin Roosevelt's "Citizen Bill of Rights,"
   which spoke of freedom from want -- rights to minimum income, housing,
   and other "adequate protections from economic fears." And, I think it
   is axiomatic that the call for such new rights (if not claims) became
   ever more prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s.
   No doubt, this gradual transformation in ideas took root and
   flourished (at least in part) because of the aggregate growth in
   wealth and resources we were witnessing in this country during the
   course of the 20th century. Against the background of this prosperity,
   poverty stood out in bold relief and in uncomfortably stark contrast
   -- even as the number of people suffering from it shrank. It is not
   surprising that people began to think that, in a world of seemingly
   unlimited resources, adversity could be eliminated, or, at the very
   least, remedied. The ideal of the "benevolent state" took hold. In our
   "enlightened" society, neglect, misfortune, and injustice did not have
   to be accepted as inevitable facts of life. Good government and laws
   could step in when necessary, as many believed they had successfully
   done during two World Wars, the Great Depression, and the civil rights
   movement.
   If one assumes that suffering and adversity can be eliminated, but
   sees a number of people continuing to suffer from adversity or
   misfortune, then there must be some forces in society that relegate
   the "have nots" to this fate. Or, at the very least, the less
   fortunate are being ignored. Those facing adversity, hence, are
   victims of a society that is not doing as much as it could (if it so
   desired), and these victims can (and should) stake a legitimate claim
   against the political and legal systems for recompense. In this view,
   neglect or selfishness on the part of society and government is
   responsible for the sting of oppression, injustice, and misfortune
   that the unfortunate and "have nots" feel today.
   In light of this modern ideology, is it any surprise that people
   identify themselves as victims and make demands on the political
   systems for special status and entitlements? Our culture expects (and,
   indeed, encourages) people to do exactly that. Consider, for example,
   the creation and continued expansion of the welfare state and other
   social programs in this country. How often have we heard proponents of
   these programs lull the poor into thinking that they are hopeless
   victims, incapable of triumphing over adversity without "benevolent
   intervention" by the state? How often have we heard these proponents
   encouraging the less fortunate in our society to become indignant
   about their situation in life and more demanding on the political
   system to find solution to their problems?
   It is not only in the political system, though, that we see our
   society and its leaders succumbing to the modern ideology of
   victimhood. As with the political system, people today also are
   strongly encouraged to make demands on the legal system by claiming
   victim status. Indeed, the legal system has, in many ways, become a
   significant driving force behind the modern ideology of victimhood.
   Courts are viewed as an effective means of forcing (or at least
   pressuring) political institutions into meeting demands for protected
   status and new rights or entitlements.
   Pointing to perceived "victimization" by "the system" or by others in
   society, our legal culture has often told the least fortunate in our
   society that their last hope is to claim special legal rights and
   benefits, or to seek exoneration for the harmful, criminal
   consequences of their acts. The least fortunate are encouraged to turn
   to legal arguments that admit defeat and that challenge the moral
   authority of society. In these ways, courts are called upon to solve
   social problems -- by creating special rules, and by crafting remedies
   that will satisfy the claims and demands of victim groups but that do
   not apply to all of us.
   Appealing to the legal system, though, was not as easy a task as
   making demands on the political system. Our legal system has
   traditionally required that redress for grievances only be granted
   after very exacting standards have been met. There had to be, for
   example, very distinct, individualized harm. And, the definition of
   harm was circumscribed by a traditional understanding of adjudication
   under the common law, where narrow disputes regarding traditional
   property rights were resolved among private parties who could not
   settle matters on their own. Very generalized claims of misfortune or
   oppression or neglect -- the kinds of assertions made in the political
   system -- would not easily fit into this common mold of court
   activity. It would not be enough for people to be indignant, angry,
   and demanding about their situation in life. There would have to be an
   assertion of a legal wrong and a persuasive argument that a legal
   remedy was available.
   The pressure of victimology "revolutionized" -- and that word does not
   always have positive connotations -- the courts and the law. For those
   in our culture seeking to use the courts as agents of social change,
   poverty, unemployment, social deviancy, and criminal behavior were not
   just unfair conditions in our society that could be eliminated if only
   people or politicians cared. Instead, these abstract problems were
   personified as the direct actions of local schools, churches,
   businesses, and other social institutions so that they could be sued
   for causing individualized harm to the victims. Based on this new kind
   of harm -- a kind of legalistic understanding of "victimage" -- the
   courts were said to be obligated to recognize special rights and
   protected status under the law.
   Take, for example, welfare rights and due process. Beginning with
   Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), our cases underscored the
   importance of welfare as a means of preventing social malaise,
   promoting the general welfare, and securing the blessings of liberty
   for all Americans. The rights to life, liberty, and property were, in
   effect, transformed from freedom from government interference into a
   right to welfare payments. There are countless other examples in legal
   literature and judicial opinions -- some have argued that inner city
   minorities and the poor should not be held responsible for the
   consequences of their criminal acts because of oppression and
   misfortune; and, of course, there is the debate now raging about
   preferences based on sex, race, and ethnicity.
   This change in our political and legal systems has been accompanied by
   the rise of the "victim group." These groups are quite useful to
   public officials for building coalitions for future political support
   and legitimacy, as well. And, for the courts, "victim groups" provide
   useful justification or cover for energizing the legislative process,
   changing the legislative agenda, forcing reconsideration of spending
   priorities, and transforming public debate.
   But the rise of victimhood, and its perpetuation by government and the
   law, is only part of the modern tragedy. There is also the dearth of
   heroes in our culture. Significantly, as the number of these "victim
   groups" has escalated, there has been a corresponding decline in the
   amount of attention that our culture has paid to heroes or, even
   worse, a conscious attempt to cheapen their achievements. Today,
   success or a commitment to fighting for noble ideas is attributed to
   self-interest, revenge, self-aggrandizement, insecurity, or some
   psychological idiosyncrasy.
   Just thumb through recently published biographies in the library or
   bookstore -- in many of them, it is not a conscious effort to be
   virtuous or to do good, but instead a series of unforeseeable and
   external forces, that lead to greatness or success. And, in many of
   these biographies, we are introduced to the uncut, "never before seen"
   foibles, mistakes, and transgressions of people our culture idealized
   for centuries. The message: that these so-called heroes are really
   just regular people capable of folly and vice who happened to have a
   few good breaks.
   In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville anticipated this state
   of affairs when he said: "Historians who live in democratic times do
   not only refuse to admit that some citizens may influence the destiny
   of a people, but also take away from the people themselves the faculty
   of modifying their own lot and make them depend on an inflexible
   providence or a kind of blind fatality."
   Now, the problem these days is not that there are no people who should
   be singled out as heroes. Rather, as Daniel Boorstin suggests in his
   book, The Image, society is preoccupied with celebrities. And heroism
   and celebrity status are two very different things. The word "hero"
   refers to people of great strength, integrity, or courage who are
   recognized and admired for their accomplishments and achievements. The
   word "celebrity," on the other hand, refers to a condition -- the
   condition of being much talked about. It is a state of notoriety or
   famousness. As Boorstin says, "A celebrity is a person who is known
   for his well-knownness." Thus, while a hero is distinguished by his
   achievement, celebrities are created by the media and are simply a
   trademark. Celebrities are, in short, neither good nor bad -- they are
   just a big name. Publicity is the defining feature of a celebrity's
   existence, and, unlike a hero who will become greater as time passes,
   time destroys celebrities. Over time the glare of publicity, as
   Boorstin notes, melts away the celebrity by shedding light and heat on
   his vices and commonplaceness.
   This pattern of ignoring and deconstructing heroes -- and focusing
   instead on the ephemeral celebrity who is known for his well-knownness
   rather than character or individual worth -- stems from the rise of
   radical egalitarianism. In the 1960s, many of the cultural elite saw a
   need to ensure absolute equality. On this view, differences in ability
   and level of achievement are random or uncontrolled; and to permit
   these characteristics to dictate human happiness and well-being would
   therefore be unfair. Celebrity status, in contrast, is not a problem
   for egalitarians, for as Boorstin notes, "anyone can become a
   celebrity, if only he can get into the news and stay there."
   Certainly, real achievement is not necessarily required.
   It should surprise no one that our culture now has far less difficulty
   recognizing celebrities than it does those who achieve success as a
   result of personal effort and character traits that we traditionally
   would consider heroic. Denigrating heroic virtue -- in other words,
   chalking heroism up to circumstance -- fits quite well with the notion
   that we must all be the same and that there can be no significant
   differences in our achievement, social standing, or wealth.
   Anyone can see what these intellectual currents have done to the
   ideals of human dignity, personal responsibility, and
   self-determination. Preoccupation with victim status has caused people
   to focus covetously on what they do not have in comparison to others,
   or on what has happened to them in the past. Many fail to see the
   freedom they do have and the talents and resources that are at their
   disposal.
   Our culture today discourages, and even at times stifles, heroic
   virtues -- fortitude, character, courage, a sense of self-worth. For
   so many, the will, the spirit, and a firm sense of self-respect and
   self-worth have been suffocated. Many in today's society do not expect
   the less fortunate to accept responsibility for (and overcome) their
   present circumstances. Because they are given no chance to overcome
   their circumstances, they will not have the chance to savor the
   triumph over adversity. They are instead given the right to fret and
   complain, and are encouraged to avoid responsibility and self-help.
   This is a poor substitute for the empowering rewards of true victory
   over adversity.
   One of my favorite memories of my grandfather is how he would walk
   slowly by the cornfield, admiring the fruits of his labor. I have
   often thought that just the sight of a tall stand of corn must have
   been more nourishing to his spirit than the corn itself was to his
   body.
   But the culture of victimology -- with its emphasis on the so-called
   benevolent state -- delivers an additional (and perhaps worse) blow to
   dignity and self-worth. When the less fortunate do accomplish
   something, they are often denied the sense of achievement which is so
   very important for strengthening and empowering the human spirit. They
   owe all their achievements to the "anointed" in society who supposedly
   changed the circumstances -- not to their own efforts.
   Long hours, hard work, discipline, and sacrifice are all irrelevant.
   In a world where the less fortunate are given special treatment and
   benefits -- and, significantly, where they are told that whatever
   gains or successes they have realized would not be possible without
   protected status and special benefits -- the so-called beneficiaries
   of state-sponsored benevolence are denied the opportunity to derive
   any sense of satisfaction from their hard work and self-help. There is
   not a one among us who views what others do for us the same way we
   view what we do for ourselves. No matter how much we appreciate the
   help, it is still just that -- help, not achievement.
   It also bears noting that our culture's preoccupation with grouping
   victims has balkanized society. The "we/they" mentality of calling
   oneself a victim of society breeds social conflict and calls into
   question the moral authority of society. The idea that whole groups or
   classes are victims robs individuals of an independent spirit -- they
   are just moving along with the "herd" of other victims. Such
   individuals also lack any incentive to be independent, because they
   know that as part of an oppressed group they will neither be singled
   out for the life choices they make nor capable of distinguishing
   themselves by their own efforts.
   As victim ideology flourishes and people are demoralized by its grip,
   more and more people begin to think that they must claim victim status
   to get anywhere in this world. Indeed, is it any surprise that anyone
   and everyone can claim to be a victim of something these days? In his
   book The Abuse Excuse, Alan Dershowitz criticizes countless examples
   of conditions that "victimize" people and thereby release them from
   responsibility for their actions. Here are just a few examples:
   x The "black rage defense," which asserts that blacks who are
   constantly subjected to oppression and racial injustice will become
   uncontrollably violent;
   x "Urban survival syndrome," which claims that violent living
   conditions justify acts of aggression in the community;
   x "Self-victimization syndrome," which maintains that people become
   less productive and creative, and become severely depressed, as a
   result of societal neglect and discrimination.
   Most significantly, there is the backlash against affirmative action
   by "angry white males." I do not question a person's belief that
   affirmative action is unjust because it judges people based on their
   sex or the color of their skin. But something far more insidious is
   afoot. For some white men, preoccupation with oppression has become
   the defining feature of their existence. They have fallen prey to the
   very aspects of the modern ideology of victimology that they deplore.
   Some critics of affirmative action, for example, fault today's civil
   rights movement for demanding equality yet supporting policies that
   discriminate based on race. These critics expect the intended
   beneficiaries of the civil rights regime to break away from the
   ideology of victimhood: to cherish freedom, to accept responsibility,
   and, where necessary, to demonstrate fortitude in the face of
   unfairness.
   I do not quarrel with this. But these critics should hold themselves
   to the same standards, resisting the temptation to allow resentment
   over what they consider reverse discrimination to take hold of their
   lives and to get the best of them. They must remember that if we are
   to play the victim game, the very people they decry have the better
   claim to victim status.
   Of course, de-emphasizing heroism exacerbates all these problems.
   Human beings have always faced the temptation to permit adversity or
   hate to dominate and destroy their lives. To counter this tendency,
   society had heroes -- people capable of overcoming the very adversity
   or injustice that currently affects today's victims. They rose above
   their circumstances and inherent imperfections. Heroes cherished
   freedom, and tried to accomplish much with what little they had.
   Heroes demonstrated perseverance in the face of adversity and used
   hardship as a means to strive for greater virtue. And heroes accepted
   responsibility -- they did what they did despite fear and temptation,
   and tried to do the right thing when presented with a choice between
   good and evil. It is awfully hard for society to inculcate these
   values without some useful models from the past and present.
   I may not have realized it as a child, but my grandfather was a hero
   who had a tremendous impact on my life. He certainly would not be a
   celebrity by today's standards. Though barely able to read and saddled
   with the burdens of segregation, he worked hard to provide for his
   family. He was a deeply religious man who lived by the Christian
   virtues. He was a man who believed in responsibility and self-help.
   And though this could not bring him freedom in a segregated society,
   it at least gave him independence from its daily demeaning clutches.
   In all the years I spent in my grandparents' house, I never heard them
   complain that they were victims. Now, they did not like segregation or
   think that it was right. In fact, there was no question that it was
   immoral and that anyone who promoted it was morally reprehensible. But
   there was work to be done. I assure you that I did not enjoy the
   demands he placed on us. I saw no value in rising with the chicken,
   and, unlike him, I was not obsessed with what I will call the "reverse
   Dracula syndrome": that is, fear that the rising sun would catch me in
   bed.
   It would not be until I was exposed to the most fortunate and best
   educated in our society that I would be informed that all this time I
   had been a victim. I am sure you can imagine what it was like when I
   returned home to Savannah, and informed my grandparents that with the
   education I had received because of their tremendous foresight and
   sacrifice, I had discovered our oppressed and victimized status in
   society. Needless to say, relations were quite strained and our
   vacation visits were somewhat difficult. My grandfather was no victim
   and he didn't send me to school to become one.
   There are many people like my grandfather alive today. The cultural
   elite does not honor them as the heroes they are, but instead views
   them as people who are sadly ignorant of their victim status or who
   have forgotten where they came from. Our social institutions do not
   train today's young to view such people as heroes and do not urge them
   to emulate their virtues.
   In idealizing heroic virtue and criticizing the victim ideology of our
   day, I am not saying that society is free from intractable and very
   saddening injustice and harm. That would not be true. But the idea
   that government can be the primary instrument for the elimination of
   misfortune is a fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition.
   There has always been bad and suffering in the world, and we must
   admit that wrongs have been and will continue to be committed. People
   will always be treated unfairly -- we can never eliminate oppression
   or adversity completely, though we can and should fight injustice as
   best we can.
   But keep in mind that all of us are easily tempted to think of
   ourselves as victims and thereby permit adversity to be the defining
   feature of our lives. In so doing, we deny the very attributes that
   are at the core of human dignity -- freedom of will, the capacity to
   choose between good and bad, and the ability to endure adversity and
   to use it for gain. Victimhood destroys the human spirit.
   I also am not saying that we should expect everyone to be a hero all
   of the time. We humans are weak by our very nature; all of us at times
   will permit hardship to get the very best of us. But having a set of
   norms to guide us and to push us along -- the stuff of heroes -- can
   be a source of great strength. If we do not have a society that honors
   people who make the right choices in the face of adversity -- and
   reject the bad choices -- far fewer people will make the right
   choices. Ultimately, without a celebration of heroic virtue, we throw
   ourselves into the current state of affairs, where man is a passive
   victim incapable of triumphing over adversity and where aggression,
   resentment, envy, and other vice thwart progress and true happiness.
   What I am saying is that it requires the leadership of heroes and the
   best efforts of all to advance civilization and to ensure that its
   people follow the path of virtue. And, because of the role law has
   played in perpetuating victim ideology and because of the influence
   law can have in teaching people about right and wrong, lawyers have a
   special obligation here. We should seek to pare back the victimology
   that pervades our law, and thereby encourage a new generation of
   heroes to flourish.
   I am reminded of what Saint Thomas Kempis wrote more than 500 years
   ago about the human spirit. His standard is a useful one for thinking
   about the instruction that our law should be offering: "Take care to
   ensure that in every place, action, and outward occupation you remain
   inwardly free and your own master. Control circumstances, and do not
   allow them to control you. Only so can you be a master and ruler of
   your actions, not their servant or slave; a free man. . . ."

@_subject: Word Processors and GUIs (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
Perhaps not, but 90% of what people *do* does fall into those operations.
Ever hear of macro's? Ever use a Sun where the menu pull-down pops up under
the pointer when you click a button? Both of these will increase the use of
a GUI to way more than a straight CLI interface (and I type at nearly 80
words a minute with a slightly crippled L. hand). I suggest you get a GUI
macro utility and something like PopUpMenu on the Amiga that makes the
menu's appear both at the command bar *and* under the mouse. Using this
technique I can execute a file save via GUI in about 1/3 the time I can in
the CLI.
You are confusing learning the commands with learning the 'model' that the
program impliments. The learning curve comes from the user learning the
model the programmer(s) had in their head(s) while writing the program and
learning to solve problems with the black box functions the
programmer/developer uses to solve those problems.
I use both POVRay as well as LightWave, one text and one GUI. The GUI
program is *much* easier to develop 3d renderings in because things like
boundary violations, control path anomolies, and such are *much* easier to
see and deal with in the GUI interface. I also use Scientific Notebook, I
can't imagine doing the same sort of things I do with that GUI
text-processor with say a textual Postscript or Tex program. Just try making
a nice nifty graphical output using Postscript (say) using a GUI and a
editor working in Postscript directly.
This assumption is *very* dependant upon the model of the software. It
depends upon whether the process takes the command sequence and executes it
in parallel or in series with the command entry sequence. In other words, if
the program renders while you are entering new commands will obviously be
much slower than a program that takes the sequence of commands in toto and
*then* executes them. The efficiency to a large part depends upon the model
of the software, not the particular command and control interface.
If you expect to execute processes in parallel (ie edit & execute in
parallel) then a GUI is much quicker (not taking into account the added
overhead of the GUI, which in and of itself is not a condemnation of the GUI
but rather the poor processors we have to run them on) because you can see
you errors as they occur and it keeps them from propogating through the
design or use process. If sequential is your goal then it really doesn't
matter because in both cases (ie GUI v CLI) becuase while it's executing
your commands you can't do anything anyway.
Of course, these models *only* apply if we are single-tasking programs. If
we allow multi-tasking then GUI wins hands down because graphical
information content is *much* higher than CLI in every case. This allows us
to display more information on a GUI than a CLI.
Personaly, this is a non-argument from the technical perspective. It is more
indicative of the mental flexibility of the holders of the various
positions. I wouldn't use an OS that wouldn't let me do both at the same
time (and I don't) and use them as I need them.
Excuse me but the user interface of your example, 123, *has* GUI elements
even in a text mode display.
This is a condemnation of human nature, not GUI's. I use a plain old text
editor when I'm making simple edits. A perfect example is from work where we
recently have taken on a group of office 'helpers' to take care of the more
mundane office needs. They discovered they could add graphics and
attachments to their email and ever since we have suffered from the abuse,
emails with a dozen attachments of pretty pictures that I have to
specificaly work through. Considering I get somewhere in the neighborhood of
500 emails a day that can be a real time sink (thank god for procmail!).
But whattcha gonna do, shoot 'em?
Then quit using the mouse on the wrong damn side of the keyboard. If you're
right handed the mouse goes on the left, not the right. That way you don't
have to quit typing to deal with the GUI. It takes a couple of days to over
come the 'handedness' that is built into our brain, but the long term
benefit is that your wrist load goes *way* down on the right *and* your left
hand fine motor control improves significantly. If you happen to be left
handed then you need a reversed keyboard with the return key and such on the
L. and the mouse on the right.
Try it for 3 days - you'll like it.
That's interesting, I use Linux (x86 & PPC) , WinNT, AmigaDos, AIX, & Solaris
at home on my personal machines (11 of them not counting the TI explorer,
, Atari 800, SX-64 and C-128) and don't find a significant difference in
reliability. They all stay up for weeks and weeks.
OS/2 is a sucky os, it's unstable and calling it reliable is a joke. It's
user interface is inconsistent, it's task swapper is weird and stalls at
strange times for no apparent reason, etc., etc. Note that this is a personal
opinion and not a function of my working for IBM and being required to use
OS/2 everyday (I don't like that requirement either). It is a function of my
using OS/2 since the 1.0 days. It's interesting to note that IBM is moving
OS/2 from the general OS area to specialized applications...

Forwarded message:
There was an employee of SJG, Lloyd Blankenship (aka The Mentor), who wrote
material for SJG and helped manage the Illuminati BBS for SJG. Lloyd was
also one of the lead members of a group called Legion of Doom (LoD) and ran
an underground BBS called Phoenix Project. Members of LoD hacked many
systems and were well known by many in various agencies and was in the
middle of a 'turf' war with Masters of Destruction (MoD) based in Georgia.
Also a member of LoD was Erik Bloodaxe who also lived here in Austin.
Because of various shennanigans various law enforcement agencies, initialy
tripped off by Operation Sun Devil (not related directly to the SJG bust),
were interestedin Lloyd & Erik's activities and particularly interested in
the GURPS Cyberpunk module that Lloyd was writing. In an attempt to shut
down the Phoenix Project and put a hush on the GURPS module, which they
claimed was a 'handbook to hack', they obtained a sealed warrant for Lloyd,
Erik, and about a dozen other members around the country as well as material
at SJG. One Sunday morning in 1990 they arrested Lloyd and several others as
well as went to SJG and attempted to enter. Nobody could be found on a
Sunday morning with a key so they kicked the door down. In the process of
confiscating the GURPS material they also took the Illuminati BBS (run on an
old Apple II) as well as answering machines, dictation tapes, etc. After
several years of legal hassle Lloyd, Erik, & SJG were cleared and *most* of
their property was returned. One of the charges against Erik at least for a
short time was 'theft of a video game'. Seems he and I had bought various
stand-up arcade video games (he had PacMan I believe and I Stargate) from a
3rd party here in Austin (Rick Wallingford of Wallingford Electronics) and
because there was no receipt and Rick wouldn't produce one they thougth it
might be stolen. Both Erik and Lloyd knew they were under observation (along
with many others in LoD and simple bystanders) because of a bar-b-q at
Rick's about a month before the bust. A couple of undercover cops were noted
watching the bar-b-q because they would get out of their car down the street
and walk around with their jackets off - hence displaying their guns. Lloyd
also found out about phone taps because the weekend before he was busted he
and I were talking on the phone and he made a comment about burning approx.
50 lbs. of printouts. When he was busted the SS dilligently took all the
ashes in his fireplace. When Erik was busted the only computer equipment in
his apartment was a dumb terminal and a 2400 baud modem. Even though I was a
user of Phoenix Project and helped work out several hardware problems in
electronics I was never directly involved with LoD nor was I ever contacted
by the SS. I never inquired into whether my phone was tapped because of
Lloyd's paper incident or if it was just his phone.
Last time I talked to Lloyd a couple of years ago he still hadn't received
all his computers and disks back. Erik did two HohoCon's here in Austin but
because of various shennanigans (like cracking the Hotel 8 computer at
Highland Mall) the show is pretty much verboten here in Austin. Lloyd went
back to school in San Marcos and was working on a comp sci degree. I haven't
talked to either Erik or Lloyd in over two years so I don't know what they
are up to now.
The police can't Constitutionaly seize anything without a warrant,
unfortunately the courts don't see it that way all the time. Technicaly if
anyone but you also uses your computer and the police wish to seize it they
must produce search warrants for the other 3rd party work, considerd a
'work in progress', on that computer. If they don't and they do deny the 3rd
party access to that material in the process of their case then the 3rd
party has the right to sue for damages at something like $1k/day. It's one
of the reasons that I have multiple users on SSZ and support several mailing
lists like this one.
That's what I know about it.

Forwarded message:
My approach to this problem has been to use a 1G drive and mount the entire
file system on it. Swap and MS-Dos each get their own partitions. This
allows the use of the entire drive as a buffer. I am in the process of
adding another 1G in approx. two weeks with the intent of moving /home off
the main drive. This not only gives the system more space but the users as
well. I set swap to 4x main ram. I use Linux and have it as one giant
partition even though suggested is blocks of 16M, works for me (YMMV). Would
be minor to monitor df and alarm when it gets to 200M or something.
I must admit however that I am looking at a faster mbrd. and a bigger hard
drive in the immediate future to make up for the extra load I expect. Had
not really planned on the remailer project however...
How about dumping the bounces to /dev/null? I shure don't care if some

I like this idea very much. Myself I would set it for like 4 hours or so and

It could happen. I don't hold to the 'medium is the message' theme

Some people don't want to stay up to date and involved, newsgroups are
great for them. Mail lists however offer a more immediate interaction.
Then for the more scholarly we should have archive sites available with
as much of the list/newsgroup traffic as is possible. So far no body has
offered to act as a archive site, any takers?

Hi all,
I am motivated to post this, something I would normaly not do, because of
the issue of trust of moderators that has arisen lately.
Igor and myself were in a discussion about number theory last nite. We
reached a point of impass. Igor made the suggestion that we bring the
discussion to cpunks. I requested that we drop the issue and specificaly not
bring it to cpunks. My reasoning had several facets. First, the position that
I was in is probably wrong. My motivation was to examine the methodology of
dis-proof (which I was disappointed with). Also, it is not a serious issue
with me and whether my particular view is right or wrong is irrelevant.
Cypherpunks is not the place for truly technical discussions (as is apparent
with even a cursory glance). Traffic on this list practicaly drowns my
ability to filter it and more drivel I (and probably you) don't need. And
finaly, the discussion was fine for a Saturday afternoon discussion, I don't
have the interest or time to carry it out over days or weeks, I have to work
for a living.
Igor agreed to drop the issue and not to bring it to the list. However, this
morning I find Secret Squirrel posting some questions which are taken
practicaly verbatin from my exchange w/ Igor. Seemed like a truly improbable

Forwarded message:
irrational means 'not expressible as the ratio of two integers', this does
not imply uncountable.
Whether 0.12345678910111213... is irrational or not depends on how we choose
to define a rational number where the denominator and numerator are both
approaching infinity and how quickly those approaches occur.
[ What is your definition of infinity/infinity ?]
As alluded to before,
  0.12345678910111213    =    12345678910111213.... / n   (where n = infinity)
0.123456789101112... is certainly countable because by the definition of
countable it must be 1-to-1 with the counting numbers (ie non-negative
integers), which this one clearly is since it contains each positive
non-zero integer (ie the set of numbers required to produce the number are
clearly less, 1 less to be exact, than the counting numbers).
pi = c/2r
You have a algorithm (ie recipe) for determining pi to whatever degree of
precision you are willing to go to. If you insist on using a digital
computer (whose domain of operation is limited to rationals by defintion)
then you are doomed to fail. However, move to analog computers (eg a
compass) and it can be quite easy to calculate, though not easy to plug into
an equation.
Complex numbers are not a member of the Reals, rather the Reals are a
sub-set of the Complex.

"If every segment is to have a numerical measure as its length, then a new

This new domain can no longer be constructed, as in the previous case, by
number pairs. But hints for its construction are provided by a theoretical
analysis of the measuring process for segments."
A mathematicaly rigorous defintion of the class of numbers called 'Real'
is that which equates the members of that set to the possible lengths of an

                             OVERVIEW OF HIV/AIDS
     _________________________________________________________________
   Some important facts about the evidence that HIV causes AIDS are:
     * Tests for HIV antibody in persons with AIDS show that they are
       infected with the virus.
     * HIV has been isolated from persons with AIDS and grown in pure
       culture.
     * Studies of blood transfusion recipients before 1985 documented the
       transmission of HIV to previously uninfected persons who
       subsequently developed AIDS.
   Before the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus
   that causes AIDS, epidemiologic studies of AIDS patients' sex partners
   and AIDS cases occurring in blood transfusion recipients before 1985
   clearly showed that the underlying cause of AIDS was an infectious
   agent. Infection with HIV has been the only common factor shared by
   persons with AIDS throughout the world, including homosexual men,
   transfusion recipients, persons with hemophilia, sex partners of
   infected persons, children born to infected women, and health care
   workers who were infected with HIV while on the job, mainly by being
   stuck with a needle used on an HIV-infected patient.
   Although we know that HIV is the cause of AIDS, much remains to be
   known about exactly how HIV causes the immune system to break down.
   Scientists are constantly discovering more information about HIV and
   AIDS. These discoveries help people learn how to stop transmission of
   the virus and help people infected with HIV to live longer, healthier
   lives. One important question to answer is why some people exposed to
   HIV become infected and others do not. Scientists believe it is most
   likely because of how infectious the other person is and how they are
   exposed. For example, more than 90 percent of persons who were exposed
   through an HIV-infected unit of blood became infected. So we know that
   blood-to-blood contact is a very efficient way that HIV is spread. On
   the other hand, many health care workers are splashed with blood or
   bloody body fluids and this type of exposure has caused very few
   occurrences of HIV infection. Researchers know how HIV is spread and
   the ways that people can help protect themselves from being exposed to

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 328 July 2, 1997    by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein
THE MARS PATHFINDER spacecraft arrives July 4 at its
destination where, after firing retrorockets and deploying a
parachute and numerous airbags, it will bounce to a halt on what
was probably an ancient floodplain.  After this, its missionary
rover will venture forth to taste rocks and make movies. The
local weather forecast calls for blue skies and wispy clouds with a
small chance of a dust storm (currently 600 miles to the south),
in which case the sky will be pink. In September another craft,
the Mars Global Surveyor, will take up orbit around Mars.  (For

STORING AN OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN A
PHOTON or any other quantum particle is possible even in the
presence of noise, researchers have concluded (B. Schumacher et
al., Physical Review A, July 1997; A.S. Holevo, upcoming in
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory).  A photon has many
different quantum states, each of which can be made to represent a
different digit.  Furthermore, one can store many digits
simultaneously in a single photon by putting it into a combination
or "superposition" of many states.  However, quantum mechanics
prevents a measuring device from perfectly distinguishing between
all these different states.  Previously, physicists discovered that the
maximum amount of information that can be read from a photon
can be no greater than the amount of entropy, or disorder, it
acquires when a range of quantum states is created to represent
different digits.  Now, the researchers show that this upper limit can
be reached, even in a noisy environment, by utilizing several
strategies, such as employing only those quantum states that are
most distinguishable.  These findings provide insights into how little
energy is required to store a message.  (For more details, go to

College, 614-427-5832)
HOLLOW NANOPARTICLE LUBRICANTS, consisting of
fullerene-like tungsten disulfide balls, have performed well in
friction and durability tests, and may be superior to other solid-state
lubricants, which usually come in powdered form.  The 100-nm
WS2 balls (much smaller than conventional powder grains, microns
across) are nested like some carbon nanotubes, but flexible.  This,
their chemical inertness, and the tendency to roll rather than slide
when pushed, should make the nanoparticles a good lubricant at the
micron scale, or as an additive in other lubricants. Scientists
working at the Weizmann Institute and at the Center for
Technological Education in Israel are now able to make gram
amounts of the lubricant.  (L. Rapoport et al., Nature, 19 June
ONE MEASURE OF A NATION'S SCIENTIFIC STRENGTH is
the number of papers it generates and the citations those papers
receive.  For the period 1992-96, these were the top  producers of
papers in a select set of journals: US (1.3 million), UK (300,000),
Japan (281,000), and Germany (259,000).  Ranked according to
citations per paper, the order becomes Switzerland (5.66), US
(5.03), Netherlands (4.46), Sweden (4.38), and UK (4.19).
The EU nations lumped together and the US each have a 36% share
of total citations.  The general trend these past 15 years has been for
the US citation rate to remain high but for its citation share to give
ground to the EU and to Asian/Pacific nations.  (ISI ScienceWatch,
May/June; also Nature, 5 June 1997.)

Passenger dragged half-naked from plane lavatory sues
    lavatory lawsuit graphic July 3, 1997
   Web posted at: 5:07 p.m. EDT (2107 GMT)
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Caught with his pants down on a trans-Atlanticflight,
   a New York businessman insists he is innocent.
    Raviv Laor says he was dragged from the bathroom of an AirFrance
   plane with his trousers around his ankles and toilet paperin his hand
   because a flight attendant wrongly thought he wassneaking a smoke.
    Laor, who says a malfunctioning smoke alarm went off, is suingthe
   airline for $12 million for his humiliation. He says he went tocourt
   after failing to get an apology or even a reply from theairline.
    Air France said Thursday that it was reviewing Laor's allegationsand
   would "respond in due course in the appropriate forum" afterconducting
   its own investigation.
  'The depth of my embarrassment I cannot begin to describe'
    The lawsuit, filed last month in Manhattan Supreme Court,asserts that
   20 minutes into a flight from Paris to Newark Airporton May 19, crew
   members broke into the locked lavatory andassaulted Laor.
   "The crew members then, while Laor was naked from the waistdown,
   dragged him outside the lavatory, exposing his genitals andother body
   parts to many seated passengers, both female and male,"the lawsuit
   said.
    "I was terrified," said Laor, 28, who owns a computer
   servicescompany. "My first reaction was 'My God, something must
   havehappened to the plane.'"
    "The depth of my embarrassment I cannot begin to describe," hesaid.
    Laor says he neither smokes nor drinks, and had opted for anonsmoking
   flight.
    He said his protestations were answered with a threat that hewould be
   arrested for arguing with the crew.
    The flight purser "told me I did not have the right to expectprivacy"
   and complained that Americans were "always screamingabout their
   rights," Laor said.
    "An official apology from Air France would have made adifference, but
   now too much time has elapsed," Laor says.

                  GERMANY PASSES WORLD'S FIRST CYBERSPACE LAW
      graphic July 4, 1997
     Web posted at: 4:10 p.m. EDT (2010 GMT)
     BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany on Friday became the first country to
     pass a law regulating the free-wheeling global electronic space of
     the Internet.
     Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government says the so-called multimedia
     law creates legal clarity that will help boost commercialization of
     cyberspace and combats illegal uses of the Internet such as for
     pornography.
     Critics say the law is an example of Germany's urge to regulate and
     may in fact deter investors in Internet services because it does not
     state clearly to what extent the providers would be liable for
     content they don't control.
     The law gained final approval in the upper house of parliament, the
     Bundesrat, an unusually swift six months after the government
     proposed it. It takes effect August 1.
     "We are entering uncharted territory," said Joerg Appelhans,
     spokesman for Germany's research and technology ministry.
     Controversially, the law says online providers can be prosecuted for
     offering a venue for illegal content if they do so knowingly and it
     is "technically possible and reasonable" to prevent it.
     This could apply to forums and similar exchanges offered by online
     services without direct control over their content.
     However, "the liability provisions for providers are a big unknown,"
     said Christopher Kuner, an Frankfurt attorney specializing in
     cyberspace issues. "It leaves a lot of things open."
     The American Chamber of Commerce in Germany says liability for
     Internet services will have to be tested by court rulings, which
     "may cause prudent investors to hesitate."
     But research and technology minister Juergen Ruettgers said a law
     was needed, partly to protect German children.
     "That applies even to a network that knows no national borders," he
     said. "The Internet is not outside the reach of the law."

            GOP: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD 'SHOCK' FOUNDING FATHERS
     July 5, 1997
     Web posted at: 3:46 p.m. EDT (1946 GMT) Solomon graphic
     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government is just too big, taking
     on things "that would have shocked" the nation's founding fathers,
     New York Congressman Gerald Solomon said Saturday in the Republican
     weekly radio address.
     "The Founding Fathers designed a government with limited and defined
     powers," Solomon said. "But that idea has been turned on its head."
     Chief among the government offenses, the congressman said, is an
     exorbitant tax bill.
     "What the founding fathers could not even comprehend is the idea of
     Americans paying more in takes than they do for food and shelter,"
     Solomon said.
     "Our Republican philosophy is different," he said. "We'd rather
     shrink the welfare class and put the American dream of financial
     security and independence within the reach of as many middle class
     people as possible."
     The recently passed budget, Solomon said, will accomplish that by
     offering tax relief to families with children, and those with
     "oppressive capital gains taxes."
     "We're not talking millionaires here," he said. "We're talking about
     people like grandparents who owned a house for years, reared their
     children in that house and then decades later they want to sell it
     when it becomes too much of burden."
     The GOP Tax Relief Act, Solomon said, "will help 2 million older
     Americans."
     Other aspects of the tax relief plan will help small business owners
     -- who may want to pass on the family business to sons and daughters
     -- by increasing an exemption on estate taxes.
     Solomon compared the current Republican tax cut to the birth of the
     United States 221 years ago.
     "Yes, on July 4, 1776, we won the battle of independence from
     oppressive taxation and today ... the Republican Congress has just
     won another battle to restore a larger chunk of that freedom from
     taxation to you," he said.  rule

Forwarded message:
NASA Select is the actual transponder you want to use for NASA stuff. Get
any of the numerous satellite magazines and they will include not only a
map of the commercial satellites but their location and other niceities.
Note that this is not all the satellites you can receive since those not
on the plane of the eccliptic will require a different mast-head (it
requires both RA and declinination, where most low-cost commercial stuff
only has RA). You will also want to check out comp.space.news and pick up
the new satellite listings that come out about once a week or so. You will
also get solar weather alerts on this newsgroup as well.
The main downside a satellite system is that you don't get any of the local
On the hardware front, decide now what kind of coverage you want. If you
have any hopes for a satellite modem (which can be quite fun to play with)
then don't get the digital dish but go with the older C/K band dishes (3m).
The setup that I use (and suggest) is:
 - local cable, at least minimal services to get the local stations
 - C/K band setup with dual decoders so that you can watch two transponder
   channels per bird
 - digital dish to receive the newer systems (if you can find a good
   source for digital sat modems for these please let me know)
I'll give you a hint on how to get started, get to know somebody in the
local sat business and get them to let you know when they replace an old
C/K band system with a new digital systems. Usualy they throw the dish,
mast-head, and cable away because they have no resale value. I got both
of my C/K dishes this way. Spent maybe $100 on cables and connectors not
counting the concrete I used to mount the masts.
With the changes in the cable laws you can now buy hacks to the boxes on the
open market. I *strongly* suggest making this purchase as anonymous as
possible. My cable guy gets a visit from the FCC about once a year on some
purchase he made. I get my ROM's and such at various electronic, hamfest,
and video get togethers that happen in and around Ctl. Texas. I am shure if
you check in your local areas similar events occur. (hint: get somebody else
to drive to the event in their car and pay with cash only and never tell
them anything about your real name or location).
Last tip, buy your own center level and don't be stingy on the cost. The
more vertical you can get your mast the happier you will be in the long
Hope it helps.

            OPEN MICROPHONE CATCHES CHRETIEN'S CRITICISM OF CLINTON
     Chretien Dehaene July 9, 1997
     Web posted at: 9:10 p.m. EDT (0110 GMT)
     From Senior White House Correspondent Wolf Blitzer
     MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
     apparently unaware that he was talking into an open microphone, was
     videotaped Wednesday making some rather undiplomatic comments about
     Bill Clinton, joking that the U.S. president formed his position
     about NATO expansion because he thought it would win votes at home.
     Chretien's remarks were caught on videotape as he talked with
     Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and Luxembourg's Prime
     Minister Jean-Claude Juncker before a NATO meeting in Madrid.
     Apparently unaware the microphone in front of him was on, Chretien
     bragged that his country does not let the United States dictate its
     policy, and suggested American politicians make decisions solely for
     reasons of expediency.
     "In your country, in my country, all the politicians would be in
     prison because they sell their votes," Chretien said.
     He also said Clinton was in favor of inviting Poland, Hungary and
     the Czech Republic to join NATO because it would woo voters.
     Speaking in French, the Canadian prime minister said: "It's not
     reasons of state. It's all done for short-term political reasons, to
     win elections. Take the quarrel over whether to admit the Baltic
     states. That has noting to do with world security. It's because in
     Chicago, Mayor (Richard M.) Daley controls lots of votes for the
     nomination."
     The three leaders laughed as they waited for the Clinton and his
     advisers to arrive for the meeting.
     Juncker asked, "And if we started without them?"
     "To prove that we know what to do without them," Dehaene added.
     "To prove we're independent. He (Chretien), he's used to not doing
     what they want," Juncker said.
     "I make it my policy," Chretien said. "But it's popular. The Cuba
     affair. I was the first to stand up" against it U.S. policy
     tightening the economic embargo on Cuba.
     The three leaders chuckled among themselves.       rule CNN Plus      * Jean Chretien      * Message Board: NATO expansion

@_subject: Gene Engineered Drug Production 
The topic of producing recreational pharmacuticals via gene engineered
organisms is an interesting topic and one we discussed at least briefly 3-4
years ago. Might be worth reviewing the archives.
There are some issues that I believe have kept this from being a commen
 *  Other than Marijuana and Cocaine most of the street pharmacuticals
    base chemicals take too much post-production to get them to a
    usable result. Either the process is something without an analog
    in the cellular systems or else it requires chemicals that don't
    occur in nature in great quantities and are such that you wouldn't
    want it produced inside the person taking the material.
 *  Marijuana's complete gene map has only been available for a little
    over 2 years.
 *  Educational and commercial institutions are not going to allow those
    with access either time or supplies to complete the project.
 *  The LEA's and drug cartels would hunt the original designer(s) down
    and most likely terminate with extreme prejudice. You would be taking
    money from their mouths (so to speak).
 *  Currently there is no country who has a legal structure such that they
    would be an acceptable haven.
 *  Where's the profit? The person who creates it most definitely will not
    get rich. Just imagine filing your patent app.
 *  E. coli or cooking yeast seem to be the best target. Both are fully
    mapped and acceptable to human systems.
 *  In the case of Marijuana the chemicals produced by the genes are
    further processed and THC gets produced at this stage. This means
    the entire 2-tier process must be moved over. Neither yeast or
    E. Coli have this process in place (both being animals that isn't
    a surprise). This complicates the process greatly.
 *  We are just waiting for some bright sole who believes that not only
    should "information be free" but so should drugs and is willing to
    spend 20 years or so on the run.
 *  Regulation of production is a big unsolved problem. Assume for a
    moment that you have ingested some yeast that is producing TCH.
    How do you turn the regulation up or down? How do you keep the
    production from running away? Most drugs LD50 is simply way too
    low for such ad hoc regulation, drugs like TCH and LSD have
    ingestion levels of such magnitude that LD50 becomes a side issue.
    LSD would have a self regulating effect so it would be mediated
    irrespective of the level produced. THC on the other hand if not
    regulated would keep you in a sleepy daze most of the time.

     ISSAQUAH, Wash. (AP) -- A man was coaxed out of his home bypolice
     after he pulled a gun and shot his personal computer,apparently in
     frustration.
     "We don't know if it wouldn't boot up or what," Sgt. KeithMoon said
     Thursday.
     The computer, in a home office on the second floor of thetownhouse,
     had four bullet holes in the hard drive and one in themonitor.
     One bullet struck a filing cabinet, while another made itthrough a
     wall and into a neighboring unit. No one was hurt.
     Police evacuated the complex, contacted the 43-year-old man
     bytelephone and got him to come out. He was taken to a hospital for
     amental evaluation.

                 DATABASE PROBLEM SLOWS SOME INTERNET TRAFFIC
     July 17, 1997
     Web posted at: 9:53 p.m. EDT (0153 GMT)
     (AP) -- A problem with the database that keeps track of all Internet
     addresses slowed network traffic for several hours Thursday morning,
     effectively blinking some Web sites out of existence.
     The problem appeared to be resolved by midafternoon.
     During the trouble, computers couldn't always find someaddresses
     ending in .net and .com, sometimes e-mail didn't go through and
     attempts to look up some Web sites came up empty.
     A user seeking an address ending in .com, for example, wouldhave
     received an error message that read "Could not resolve DNS," said
     Aggie Nteta, a spokeswoman for Network Solutions Inc., which runs
     the main registry of Internet addresses, called InterNIC, under an
     arrangement with the U.S. government.
     Every morning at 2:45 a.m. EDT, the files listing all Internet
     addresses for North America are updated and sent out through the
     network. On Wednesday morning, two of those files somehow became
     corrupted, setting off error alarms.
     However, the system administrator on duty chose to release the files
     anyway, creating a situation in which many Web sites effectively
     blinked out of existence, at least in the eyes of browsers.
     "The big effect was that our site became invisible," saidChris
     Caldwell, chief engineer at NDA, a Web site design company in
     Woburn, Massachusetts.
  Problems with addresses
     The files were corrected and re-released about four hours later,
     although it may have taken several more hours for the corrected
     information to spread throughout the network, Nteta said.
     The problem is the latest in a series of addressing glitchesover the
     past few days. Last weekend AlterNIC, an InterNIC rival, briefly
     took over InterNiC's address on the Web. AlterNIC described this on
     its Web site as a form of protest over InterNIC's current monopoly
     on distribution of Internet addresses.
     InterNIC has also encountered numerous problems with badinformation
     on its database. Some businesses have been double billed, while
     others have had their Web sites dropped from the address lists by
     mistake.
     Dave Crocker, a computer consultant and founder of theInternet Mail
     Consortium, said it was a problem of qualityassurance.
     "The fact that they are growing quickly is not an excuse forthis.
     The rate of errors they are having would not be tolerable for any
     other professional organization doing a technical task," he said.

   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The battle in Congress over export limits on
   computer encoding technology will heat up again next week as the House
   International Relations Committee is scheduled to vote on a bill to
   dramatically relax the current restrictions.
   [INLINE] The legislation, already approved by the House Judiciary
   Committee, would allow U.S. companies to export powerful encryption
   programs, software which scrambles information and renders it
   unreadable without a password or software "key."
   [INLINE] The International Relations Committee plans to hold a vote on
   July 22 on the bill, authored by Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte and
   called the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act.
   [INLINE] Once the realm of spies and generals, encryption has become
   increasingly important as a means of securing global communications
   and electronic commerce over the Internet.
   [INLINE] The Clinton administration favors strict controls on
   encryption exports unless the programs allow the government to crack
   the codes by gaining access to the software keys. But many lawmakers
   oppose the limits, which they say hurt U.S. firms while allowing
   foreign companies to gain market share.
   [INLINE] The Goodlatte bill has over 190 co-sponsors, including a
   majority of members of the committee.
   [INLINE] But committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, a New York
   Republican, is strongly opposed and may try to amend the bill to
   retain most export controls, congressional staffers said.
   [INLINE] The substitute amendment could be modeled on encryption
   export provisions in a broader bill in the Senate backed by Arizona
   Republican John McCain and Nebraska Democrat Bob Kerrey, staffers
   said. That bill was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last
   month, but a bill more similar to Goodlatte's is pending in the Senate
   Judiciary Committee.
   [INLINE] The McCain-Kerrey bill would allow free export of
   medium-strength encryption, with keys up to 56 bits long, and
   establish a board to consider raising the limit in the future. But the
   president would have the authority to overrule the board's decisions
   for reasons of national security.
   [INLINE] The vote in the International Relations Committee could be
   close, some lobbyists said.
   [INLINE] "I think the votes are there to defeat a substitute, but it's
   probably going to be close," said one industry lobbyist who asked not
   to be named.
   [INLINE] The Goodlatte bill would also prohibit mandatory key recovery
   for encryption used within the United States and criminalize the use
   of encryption to hide evidence of a crime. But those provisions are
   outside the International Relations committee's jurisdiction.
   [INLINE] Privacy advocates back the bill, arguing that people need
   unfettered access to strong encryption to protect the privacy of
   personal data, medical records and electronic communications. The
   software industry is also supporting the legislation.
   [INLINE] But FBI director Louis Freeh and other top law enforcement
   officials warn that the proliferation of strong encryption overseas
   will complicate the task of keeping tabs on international criminals
   and terrorists. Link to top    home | digitaljam | contents | search | stock quotes | help

     currently running come from since it would not be possible to turn
     the execution key into an actual machine address.
 -   automatic and anonymous software selection
     Jobs don't need to have the required software or even where it might
     be located. The job would need to understand the catalog scheme in
     place to locate the software (think of a library card system).
Since the OS already bids for processor space it would not require a
major architecture mod to include E$/crypto functions.
I have to disagree. Bloatware comes from the way we look at software
(ie generalize & modularize it) and the way we impliment it (ie libraries).
While it makes the programmers job easier it makes the amount of software
required for the job larger that required because the libraries have
functions and features that aren't used (in this product). Bloatware won't
be fixed unless we (ugh) go back to monolithic project design with most
code custom built with little re-use from previous versions. I suspect it is
easier to buy another 4M of RAM than to pay the programmers to re-create the
wheel each time a new version comes out.

I have obtained a Sparc ELC (4/25) w/ 24M of RAM and 200M of disk space
under Solaris 1.1.2 (SunOS 4.1.4). I will be installing the gcc suite from
the O'Reilly "Programming with GNU software" since this is a supported
OS. I intend to set it up as a small public access irc server. I was
wondering if anyone had suggestions on such hardware and what to use.
The crypto relevance is that I was thinking of having a  channel which
would receive traffic from the regular mailing list. In other words when a
user joins  they could use the normal irc functions but a bot would be
receiving the mailing list traffic as it arrives and sending it out. I am
not proposing to send the  traffic to the mailing list. It would be
one way only. Though a bot function to forward mail on a per request basis
might be implimented if some suitable abuse avoidance mechanism could be
worked out.
Any other crypto relevant suggestions on this topic welcome.

Hi Jack,
I have removed your subscription to the Experimental Science Instrumentation
mailing list.
I would however like to point out that security through obscurity (ie
ignorance) is not security. It is self-delusion. One can not protect them
selves reliably from the many consequences of technology and society via
ignorance. That which you don't know not only can hurt you but can kill you.

No, I hate unix security and it behooves me to know as much about it as
possible so that I may be better informed about its limitations and protect
myself and my property from those out there who hate unix security and plan
on using it to get something from me without my prior permission.
So studying the dynamics of auto glass breaking is equivalent to automotive
vandalism? I bet auto engineers might just object to that generalization.
If I own the car it might be in my best interest to know something about
auto glass to decide whether what I have is enough or should I really buy
that nifty keen security system. Calling the cops and asking them how most
cars get broken into does not lead to the conclusion that I am going to
break into cars.
"A>B" is not equivalent to "B>A".
Discussion toward understanding something is not the same as doing it. If it
were we would all be rapists and murders. Computer science isn't an amateur science? I have to strongly disagree and I
suspect that most computer hobbyist would as well.
I don't know about you but I use my computer for science (and sometimes
it's hooked up to other computers via the net) and therefore find it useful
to understand how they work. Both for when I want to get them to do
something specific as well as when trying to figure out why the silly thing
don't work the way it is supposed to.
This list supports the use of computers as well as the study of them as
analytical instruments or as objects of research themselves. The study of
virus development is as valuable as the discussion of compiler design.
I will attach the info file at the end so that you may review the general
views of the list as well as some of my own.
I have no objection to the discussion of such issues provided they are
within the charter of the list. In short, discussions about how they work,
how to measure various parameters (eg briance and explosives), the history
of the technology, etc. Obviously you can't discuss how to measure the
effectiveness of a poison, for example, if you can't first define what a
poison is and how it works (otherwise how do you know what to measure?).
So if somebody, for example, wanted to discuss how curari works toward the
end of better understanding the human body and the measurement of its
various processes there would be no objection. If you want to propose going
out and actualy killing somebody, then I have a problem.
Knowledge is danger, leave them barefoot and pregnant...
Do what you want, but this list is not rated and irrespective of your
opinion I will continue to refuse to rate any services from SSZ.
Please, don't send them to somebody who has a clue about it and can direct
them to creative uses for that interest (ie visit the Polic Bomb Squad and
perhaps try to get them to support some sort of activity with the kids),
instead let them figure it out with their friends in the garage over a long
weekend. If we're lucky one of them will survive.
Would you do me a favor and auto-program the phone for 911...

Welcome to the Experimental Science Instrumentation mailing list. This list
is hosted by CyberTects in Austin, Tx. If you have questions or problems
please send email to 'list at ssz.com'. You should receive a responce shortly
There is a place for a webpage on the SSZ homepage. However, currently
nobody is involved in any sort of project. If interested please send a note
to the list. To see what else is up at CyberTects look at
 It ain't much, but it is home...;)
This mailing list is intended for the rigorous exploration of nature. One of
the primary areas of experimentation is instrumentation and data reduction.
This list is intended as a resource for the advancement of knowledge in both
areas. As a consequence off-topic discussions are STRONGLY avoided.
This list is NOT intended for beginners. They are certainly welcome but are
expected to stay out of discussions they are not experienced in. General
questions are welcome from any party on relevant issues. We strongly believe
the novice experimenter should be helped. Discussions at all levels are
available. It is not acceptable behaviour to expound on personalities or
other 'flame bait' topics.
Sale and advertisment of services are permitted with due consideration of
the other members of the list. Each 'ad' should appear ONLY ONCE per
calendar year. The 'ad' MUST be relevant to the mailing list members and its
charter topic. All responces should be by direct email.
As a member of this list it is expected you pursue active experiments or
projects. We would very much like to hear about what you are up to and where
you are taking it. A working knowledge of diff-eq's, computer programming,
basic electronics (analog & digital), physics, chemistry, safety
proceedures, etc. is assumed for most discussions.
The person behind the email is Jim Choate. I would like to tell you a little
about myself and provide some insight into the mailing list.
This list is NOT for the exploration of pseudo-science, space aliens, etc.
I named the list after Nikola Tesla because I admire his accomplishments and
his strong indipendant nature.
I have been building 'projects' since I was a kid of 8-9, I am now 37. For
seven years I built projects at Discovery Hall, a hands-on science museum in
Austin, Tx. I am currently working on a hexapod robot and a high-performance
rocket. I am currently a computer engineer for Tivoli - IBM as well as run my
own business, CyberTects. In both cases I play with what I lovingly refer to
as the 'bleeding edge'. Through CyberTects I support several hands-on
technology mailing lists and two user groups.
I started the list a couple of years ago with the intent of finding others
who like to build 'professional' quality projects. Since that time it has
grown slowly but steadily by word of mouth. The folks who participate in the
mailing list are truely an impressive lot. Don't feel hesitant about
starting a dialogue. Historicaly the list has been very low traffic. The
majority of traffic is cross-posts from other sources. I would really like
to see more discussion about current projects.

Bohr's objection was one of religion, not reality. His objection was one of
familiarity breeding contempt of God.
It was Stephen Hawking who made the quip about not seeing the dice.
The SU(5) theory was arrived at by political contrivance in 1927 when the
Solvay Conference was called to resolve the various theories that happened
to be flying fast and furious at the time, instigated by DeBroglie. Because
several of these theories were completely in agreement with experiment it was
becoming impossible to make progress because of all the possibilities. The
question asked was "what theory shows the most promise for continued research
and acceptance of requests for operating capital." The SU(5) was arrived at
by majority vote and not experimental verification.
Einstein's objection to the Uncertainty Principle was the same as David
Bohm's. In fact most physicists at the time were opposed to it, the famous Schroedinger Cat was meant to be an objection to the theory and in
particular to show how unrealistic it was. If you happen to be willing to do
away with the standard SU(5) theory then the Uncertainty Principle goes away,
a good example is to look at David Bohms 'many worlds' theory as it has no
uncertainty principle involved. Bohm was black-balled by the conventional
physics community because he would not accept the SU(5) even in principle. It
has only been in the last 15 years or so that serious review of Bohm's work
has taken place. Alfven and others have used it and other approaches to bring
many of the basic tenets of the SU(5) and the Big Bang into question.
Interesting aspect is even his most strident opponents admitted their
objection to his theories were based on emotion and mental attitudes and not
on any failure regarding experimental verification. He was and is considered
one of the greatest modern physicists, on a par with Einstein and et ali.

I didn't say it did, I said the conference which decided what would end up
being the 'standard model' was decided in 1927. I further thought it was
interesting that the deciding factor was how the participants FELT about the
various theories and on NO theoretical or experimental evidence whatsoever.
The fact that I used the SU() symbology is a reflection of my thinking and
not history. When I took Engineering Physics from Sudarshin at UT in '82
that was what he used because he worked in particle physics. You are of
course free to use whatever symbology you feel comfortable with.
SU() is the symbology used by physicist as an extension of group
theory's U() symbology. The number in the () represents the number of
indipendant variables in the model and tells the researcher how many rows
and columns they need in their representative matrix.
SU(5) is the symbology used for the standard model of quantum mechanics.
SU(22), for example, is the commen "Super-string" theory that was of such
popularity a few years ago.
Glashow & Georgi developed the standard model representation in terms of
SU() in 1973. It has become the standard representation via group theories
for the standard model since then.
Bottem line, all cosmological theories that I am aware of can be mapped onto
SU() models. This is the power of this symbology in manipulating the models.

   WASHINGTON (CNNfn) - President Clinton has settled on William Kennard
   to be his choice to become the next chairman of the Federal
   Communications Commission, well-placed Administration officials tell
   CNN.
   [INLINE] Kennard, the FCC's current general counsel, would succeed
   Reed Hundt, if confirmed by the Senate.
   [INLINE] The sources say the president could make the announcement as
   early as Friday, though the official announcement could slip a bit.
   [INLINE] Kennard was favored for the job by Vice President Al Gore,
   the White House official who makes most of the final decisions
   regarding FCC appointments, because of Gore's long time work on
   telecommunications issues. But another telecommunications policy maker
   in Washington is furious at the White House for the Kennard selection.
   [INLINE] Sen. Ernest Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the Senate
   Commerce Committee, had pushed his former chief of staff on the
   committee, Ralph Everett, for the job. Everett, the first African
   American to ever serve as chief of staff to any Senate committee, had
   the endorsement of 16 Senators and was considered a leading candidate
   for the job.
   [INLINE] Not only is Hollings angry that his candidate didn't get the
   nod, but sources say he is also miffed about how the White House
   handled the process of making the final decision. White House Chief of
   Staff Erskine Bowles called Hollings, Senate sources say, "to
   apologize for how this was handled."
   [INLINE] One source close to Hollings told CNN Financial News, "Don't
   expect quick work in the Senate on this nominee."
   [INLINE] The president also is expected to nominate Justice Department
   attorney Michael Powell to fill a Republican vacancy on the
   five-member FCC, according to the sources.
   [INLINE] And Gloria Tristani, a phone regulator from New Mexico, is
   expected to be Clinton's choice to fill a Democratic seat.
   [INLINE] Those two nominations, however, aren't expected to be
   announced at the same time as the Kennard pick. Clinton already had
   nominated Kennard for the FCC. But the president has yet to name his
   choice for chairman of the agency following Hundt's announcement in
   May that he planned to leave.
   [INLINE] Clinton already has nominated Harold Furchtgott-Roth, chief
   economist for the House Commerce Committee, to fill a second
   Republican vacancy. The FCC oversees the phone, broadcast, wireless,
   satellite and cable-television industries. Link to top    home | washington unwrapped | hot stories | contents | search | stock

This is a cop-out attitude. They should have screamed bloody murder and
demanded at least a public apology. Every commercial customer should
understand their right to sue for losses related to 'work in progress' and
for such seizures to be legal must be explicity listed on the search
warrant. Simply buying service from a company isn't worth the hassle to push
as probable cause, especialy if wrong even in one instance.
Hell, if they make less than a million a year each now it is in their best
interest to fight. The income potential alone is worth it assuming they had
the moxy to figure out a good way to market it. Which might be a novel
tactic to use, "screw with me and I'll make money off it, screw with me more
and I'll make even more..."
If the NSA can take our federaly mandated tax dollars to run a commercial
enterprise in the market they set legislation for why should anyone object
to others making a profit off their actions?
We need an amendment something akin to the 1st relating to the relationship
between government and commercial enterprise.

Photons are the vector boson for em radiation, in a wire or in the air.
In the wire the photons go from electron and protons to other electrons and
protons. This is what makes them want to 'move'. Despite popular vision, they
don't go bumping into each other like a bunch of ping-pong balls in a pipe...
As an aside, this is actualy where the heat comes from not friction. Some of
the photons that are emitted are low frequency and not re-absorbed.

             POLICE: DRUG-ADDICT MOM KILLED BABY WITH BREAST MILK
      Powell July 31, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:55 p.m. EDT (0255 GMT)
     TUCSON, Arizona (AP) -- Police have charged a woman with murder,
     claiming her breast milk was so full of heroin and methadone that it
     killed her 7-week-old daughter.
     The father was also charged with murder for not intervening,
     authorities said.
     "It's true with any form of child abuse that it's preventable, but
     this one seems to be more preventable. It seems to be more of a
     conscious choice," Tucson Police Detective Sgt. Brett Klein said
     Thursday.
     Doctors put Eve Powell into the intensive care unit after she was
     born on May 16 because she was dependent on methadone, the
     opium-based drug used to help wean heroin addicts.
     Before sending Eve home from the hospital a month later, medical
     workers warned the baby's 24-year-old mother, Amoret Powell, that
     resuming her heroin habit while breast-feeding could kill the baby,
     police said.
     But on July 10, tiny Eve was rushed to another hospital,suffering
     from severe oxygen deprivation. She died the next day.
     On Wednesday, authorities charged Amoret Powell with first-degree
     murder, alleging that she killed her daughter by giving her
     drug-filled breast milk.
     Police found used syringes and other drug paraphernalia in her home,
     and she admitted using heroin after Eve's birth, Klein said.
     Test results from Eve's body are pending, but doctors say the
     heroin-methadone combination can cause the oxygen deprivation that
     killed the baby.
     Eve's father, Robin Johnson, 33, also was charged with murder
     because the death resulted from child abuse and he did nothing to
     stop it, Klein said. Each is being held on $1 million bond.
     Powell is not the first mother to face a murder charge fornursing a
     child while using drugs. A jury in Bakersfield, California,
     deadlocked on a murder charge but convicted a woman of child
     endangerment after she nursed while using methamphetamine. Another
     woman in Los Angeles pleaded guilty to child endangerment for also
     nursing while using methamphetamine.

Actualy with the wording of the 9th and 10th you as a citizen are reserved

For the government to prove their side they MUST demonstrate a
constitutional mandate.
Also notice the heirarchy of prohibition detailed in the 10th. The people

discusssion of federal powers versus citizen rights falls to the people

even has the power to prohibit.

  that my rights as a citizen, or even as a human being, are not limited
  by the Constitution by explicit intent of the authors.]
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. [ The powers which are not assigned to the federal government by the
  Constitution OR prohibited in respect to the states falls to the
  states (acting per their own individual constitutions as the deciding
  factor within their borders) and if not covered in the state constitution
  then to the poeple to decide (assuming a popular vote). It is critical
  to note that no explicit limit is placed on the issues decidable by the
  people, a difference explicitly pointed out with the federal and state
  governments.] [The first ten amendments went into effect on 15 December 1791.] A perfect non-crypto example is the current brew-haha over assisted suicide
and a Constitutional right to die. The question is not whether I have a
right to kill myself (assisted or otherwise). The 9th clearly states that
just because a right I might claim is not listed does not mean I don't have
it. Now the 10th says that if the federal government wants to control it
they must show a delegation of authority in the Constitution. So, despite
what the esteemed Supremes may think the question is not "Does the
Constitution allow a citizen to do this?" which is what they announced as
their 'first' question but rather, " does the Constitution delegate the
authority to decide when or how a citizen may die?" If not then each
individual state should decide the issue until or if an amendment can be
passed. Should individual states not cover such decisions in their own
constitutions then the poeple decide the issue individualy until a vote
can be arranged. The problem with our current operation is that we don't
have enough plebicites.

This is an interesting insight into the underpinnings of a democracy or
republic. The secret to success and ultimate limitation of government
authority is people standing up and saying "Hell NO!, I won't take it any
more." In short, for democracy (any democracy I suspect) to work it REQUIRES
people being unwilling to compromise. So many people labor under the
impression that compromise is how they get to where they want to be. Very
successful indoctrination I suspect...

But it isn't the same as you present it. I will explain below.
Let's look at this carefuly for a moment. Child pornography in and of itself
is irrelevant. The issue is sexual acts involving one or more children by
adults which are committed with (or without) the specific intent of creating
some physical record for personal use or to pass to others (with or without
Now let's contrast this with a simple pencil drawing of a child and an
adult having sex (eg. Greek pottery).
The question is are these two acts, one involving a real physical act
involving a minor, and the other as a physical expression of the artists
imagination equivalent?
Some would have you believe they are the same. Unfortunately, I have yet to
see a clear explanation of the view. Now the other side is that they are
different. This belief rests on at least two basic tenents. The first being
that it is the physical act that constitutes the crime and not simply
thinking about it. The second is that there is a fundamental difference of
quality between an item and its representation in some symbology. From this
it becomes clear that the issue is how do we reduce the initial sexual
contact. If THAT can be resolved the other problems resolve themselves. Now,
let's assume for a moment that we have in fact resolved this issue. Should
we then regulate representations of these acts by persons when it is assumed
no actual child was involved? The representation is nothing more than the
ramblings of an expressive mind. So are we not making certain thought
illegal? This certainly contrasts with the belief that a crime requires an
act. That doesn't sound very rational to me. And what about if I don't draw
it but rather write a story? Or perhaps use my image editor to take children
bathing suite adds and medical sources to fill it out, why should this be
any different than a written description? Or perhaps that image on the Greek
pot? No, these sort of line drawing was meant to be prohibited by the
Constitution. The founding fathers must have known the world was a gray sort
of place so they took special precautions (ie 10 Amendments) to make nice and
clear boundaries for the federal government (ie 1'st Amendment). It is clear
that they expressely did not want the government involved in human
This is a straw man. There is no crypto involved in the physical act. Nice
strawman argument though, got almost the whole damn world swallowing at this
Only if you are confused about exactly what the issue at hand is. We need
diagnostic proceedures usable by regular physicians and the issue really
needs to be handled as a medical and not a legal issue. Putting people in
jail won't effect this sort of human behaviour one damn bit. By the time the
guy gets to jail some poor kid has been really abused, is that how you want
your kid dealt with?

   Federal Trade Commission    TRUSTe NEW YORK (CNNfn) - There's an Internet argument going on.
   [INLINE] On one side are people who want to surf the Net in peace,
   free from the "spam" and insidious snooping of those anxious to make a
   quick buck.
   [INLINE] On the other side are businesses looking to take advantage of
   the Internet's promise as a vehicle for reaching specific customers
   cheaply and efficiently.
   [INLINE] Can the two sides coexist? Or will privacy advocates succeed
   in driving cyber-hawkers off line?
   [INLINE] Unlikely, experts say. That's because online companies are
   starting to use other marketing tools that make people worry less
   about Big Brother.
   [INLINE] The issue has heated up lately. Privacy rights groups are
   alarmed about the potential for abuse with junk e-mail and other
   invasive technology. In response, the Federal Trade Commission is
   probing whether marketers are snooping too much.
   [INLINE] The industry, meanwhile, is coming up with its own solutions
   to prevent lawmakers from stepping in.
   [INLINE] Experts say most of the practices raising eyebrows aren't
   much different from what's been happening off-line for years. Yet
   other analysts concede there is danger in an age where extensive
   personal information is available with the press of a key.
   [INLINE] "Consumers don't like to be shoulder-surfed when they're
   online," said Kate Delhagen, a senior analyst with Forrester Research
   Inc. in Cambridge. "(But) this is not a deal-breaker for the Web. The
   Web is alive and well and will continue to thrive. These little bombs
   will continue to go off, and they'll continue to be fixed."
   [INLINE] Besides e-mail, or "spamming," some marketers use browser
   technology to find out where a user has been on the Net or track him
   when he leaves a site by following his electronic footprints.
   Companies are also selling information on databases.

   Scott, executive director of TRUSTe, a non-profit organization of 50
   companies whose mission is to promote trust in online commerce.
   [INLINE] Dan Miller, senior editor with The Web Magazine in San
   Francisco, thinks junk e-mail and the other practices aren't central
   to doing business online.
   [INLINE] "You can do business online without violating someone's
   privacy," Miller said.
   [INLINE] Instead of flooding people with junk e-mail, or "spam," some
   companies such as Amazon.com ask users if they want to be notified
   about new products, Miller said. That puts the control in the hands of
   the users, he said.
   [INLINE] In other cases, companies are creating new partnerships, like
   the one between Border books and Salon, an online Arts magazine,
   Miller said. At the end of Salon's book reviews is a link to Border so
   people can order the book.
   [INLINE] Experts said the disputed methods do work - but at the risk
   of alienating customers.
   [INLINE] "People universally hate spam," said Evan Schwartz, author of
   "Webonomics" and a contributing editor to "Wired" magazine. Smart Web
   sites treat customers respectfully by avoiding mass e-mailing or
   selling information from lists, he said.
   [INLINE] Scott said spamming is more widespread among smaller
   companies because it's so cheap - pennies for each e-mail address
   compared to a few dollars for each name in direct mail.
   [INLINE] "It's a numbers game - the more you send out, the more
   response you get," Scott said. The method has about a 1 percent
   return.
   [INLINE] Sanford Wallace, founder and president of Cyber Promotions,
   the largest bulk e-mail company in the country, insists the practice
   doesn't violate privacy. But he helped organize the Internet E-Mail
   Marketing Council to promote ethical standards. The council has a
   central address where people can get their names removed from all mass
   e-mailers.
   [INLINE] While the new standard might mean the loss of huge numbers of
   customers, "there are still millions and millions left," Wallace said.
   [INLINE] Tracking has been effective to help marketers find out about
   a person's interests so they can target ads, Scott said. If a person
   visits gardening sites, for example, a vendor can flash banner ads on
   the topic.
   [INLINE] "People don't understand the technology and there's a lot of
   anxiety about it," Scott said. "There's so much bad press that it's
   past the point of educating the consumer."
   [INLINE] Controversy about tracking was so heated two archrivals,
   Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp., recently proposed a
   common standard so users can control how much information is available
   about themselves.
   [INLINE] Experts say selling information from databases isn't much
   different from what's been happening in the catalogue business.
   [INLINE] "That type of thing happens all the time," said Don Heath,
   president and chief executive of the Internet Society, a non-profit
   organization of 8,000 individuals and organizations.
   [INLINE] Eight information companies, including LEXIS-NEXIS, recently
   adopted guidelines to protect personal information like Social
   Security numbers on databases.
   [INLINE] Scott argued that most online companies still rely on
   traditional advertising.
   [INLINE] "These (disputed) methods haven't been widespread," Scott
   said. "Even Yahoo goes on TV to tell people to get on the Web. To
   reach the mass market, you have to go through traditional means."
   [INLINE] Scott thinks the uproar about electronic privacy will force
   people to think about the issue off-line, too. People have resigned
   themselves to getting piles of junk mail and catalogues, for example.
   [INLINE] "People had given up trying to protect their privacy, but
   this will make them think about it again," Scott said. Link to top    [INLINE] -- Martine Costello

Alaska was not only bombed by a foreign country (ie Japan) but it was the
only continental US location to actualy be invaded. Do a search on Kiska and
Dutch Harbor on Yahoo....
Hawaii was also bombed and last time I checked it was part of the US, the
same goes for Wake Is., Midway Is., and Phillipines.

Several people have made comment on the difference between states and
protectorates of one sort or another in reference to the comment I made
about Oregon being the only US state to be bombed in WWII. While this is
technicaly true if you go back and look at the original posting I replied
too was made in the context of US involvment in the war and how isolated
we were, so isolated, the claim went, that the Japanese were unable to
invade or otherwise attack the US.
While it is true that Oregon was the only area attacked which was a state
under the context of US possessions being attacked it is false.
The main point here is that the original proposal was incorrect due to more
than a semantic technicality. This brings the whole issue of the US sitting
out the war into question. A question I answer strongly in the negative. It
is not possible that the US could have sat out the war as a neutral.

Two Jap subs were sunk in San Francisco harbor. Unfortunately I can't find
the dates, will keep looking.
Actualy it was a man, his wife, and two children. The two kids were playing
with it when it went off. My memory tells me that the women and two kids
were killed. Don't remember if she was a teacher or not. There was an
interesting video recreation on TDC last month on this incident on a special

Actualy most of them were released from the Japanese mainland at specific
points. If you do further research on this you will learn how they used the
ballast sand in the balloons (mechanicly complicated) to track their source.
All the sites were bombed and the baloons ceased.

Distinction noted. I suppose the fact that American laws govern these areas,
and they pay taxes, and can be drafted into our military, get citizenship at
birth, etc. are totaly and completely irrelevant and completely unrelated to
issues such as these. Thinking like yours is why McArthur got such support
when he promised to return to the Phillipines when even his bosses were ready
to write it off. It's why the Japanese have such a high regard for him
respecting his tenure as military dictator of Japan during their rebuild.
If you haven't read it you might consider reading his biography American
Ceaser for its insight into the politics of these two periods.
The US didn't choose to enter the war however, that is the issue not your
nit-picking over some irrelevant boundary distinction.
One thing is clear to anyone who lived in that period as an adult or studies
it carefuly, the distinctions that Tim is claiming to be relevant were not
important to the people living at the time. When it came to shooting
'Americans' (not Americans in a state, or not on vacation, etc. noise) it
was the shooting of Americans that was at issue and not whether Alaska or
Hawaii really would become a state in 1959. It is not reasonable to expect
the United States of America could have 'sat out' the war. It was and is
clear that American MUST enter the war at some point. The British were down to their last $750M in a S. African bank that went walkaround on an American
transport to pay outstanding bills. Because of the economic and social ties
between American and Britian any thesis claiming America could (let alone
should) have remained neutral is pure meta-history. Consider the
unrestricted German submarine warfare occuring as close as 30 miles from
the Eastern seaboard. How long would people put up with bodies washing up
on their beaches regularly? What would have been the impact of doing
business with Europe under the German helm in the US (which couldn't exist
at anything close to todays tech/social level without strong economic
markets)? The Germans and Russians managed to arrive at a commen goal in the
invasion of Poland. Without the drain of the African and Cicilian campaigns
(which required the support of the US on a military footing to succeed) it
is just possible that Russia could sue for peace with Germany causing at
least a temporary breathing spell for the marshalling of forces. It is also
clear at this point that Germany had a much larger technology lead over the
Russians (research where the tubes for Russian radios came from) and such
weapons as the ME-262, V1, V2, etc. Under this light it is clear that
given a breathing space Germany allied with Japan (assuming the successful
invasion of Australia, with no Britian and no US how long would they last?)
would pose a real threat to the US, including the direct assault on the
continental US. If we can do it in Europe and Africa what in the world makes
you think somebody else can't do it? Without US intervention in the war
Italy would own Africa now.
Those folks were predators, they didn't back down. The Japanese would have
gone for the west coast. The Russians would look at the Alaskan peninsula
(bought from Russia in the 1800's) and lick their chops. The South American
continent would have been Germanic/Japanese without US intervention. The influx of Germans into Argentina and Japanese to Peru started in the 20's
and not the 50's. Germany was building a bomber to hit New York and long
range fast transport subs, their intent was clear.
Why the United States entered WWII can't be attributed to ANY single
simplistic thesis such as this. It is also clear that the Japanese and
German decision making processes were not motived this simply either.

I agree, I keep asking for your examples and proof and you keep avoiding
providing them. You should consider being a politician or a lawyer. It's a
real pity you can't seem to approach this discussion in good faith and with
a sense of open analysis.
Pure market anarchy? What the hell is a pure market? I know what a free
market is. Define it first. Explain how it, without an explicit
bill of rights, will protect my rights? Explain how we don't end up with a
Microsoft that owns everything which effectively reduces to a commercial
communism? Where are my 'exit' choices then? What in the world would
motivate such an entity to provide me with the resources to be a direct
competitor, something clearly not in its best interest for long-term
survival? How will others learn the technology and its applications outside
the purvue of these economic regulatory entities. The unlimited expansion of
the rail-roads in the 1800's is a excellent simili for comparison for both
what such a system would be like as well as the major problems it *doesn't*
address. Taminy Hall ring any bells? There was a free market political
system if there ever was one; pay me and I'll do it for you, don't and you can freeze in hell. A more modern example is the history of the
telecommunications companies which even after being broken up have now
re-combined so that we in effect only have 3 domestic tel-comm providers, and
they are discussing how to combine their resources. Further explain why such
a system will guarantee that my views will at least be addressed at some
level and not relegated a priori to a trash-heap because it goes against the
market analysis of some bunch of bean-counters? Who do I go to for
resolution of claims against these entities, the self-same entities? You
call that justice, equality, or even representation? Explain why and how such
a economic based system will guarantee my right to free speech or even to run
a small business which I currently do when it is clear that I am in open
competition with the very entities which provide me the resources to make the
money? What is the economic motivation for the resource controlling entities
to support my freedoms when it reduces their income? Explain how your system
prevents economic black-balling? Another implication is that we will see more
of the sort of business stategies implimented by PGP Inc. (for example) where
they want a percentage of your income *without* accepting a percentage of the
risk, economic tyrany is tyrany just the same. What recourse do I have if the
monopolies which arise in such a system decide that the services or resources
I need won't be provided? Am I then supposed to just calmly accept becoming
some prole for some zaibatsu? What happens when those monopolies decide that
if they work together they can further streamline the market, and my going to church or taking a vacation goes against those business requirements?
It sounds like you are supporting Hirshleifer who says:
"The mere fact of low income under anarchy... of itself provides no clear
indication as to what is likely to happen next."
[Personly, Hirshleifer is an idiot who apparently doesn't hang out on the
wrong side of the tracks and therefore has no clue as to what motivates
the poor or stupid.]
Which in effect breaks down into one of two results for individuals (which
all free market anarchists admit openly) who don't have sufficient income
to buy their indipendance and their say:
1.  they devote a great deal of effort to fighting to gain control over
    resources.
or 2.  they capitulate to some other party and turn over their resources
    for food and shelter.
History would argue that people will accept neither of these as a solution
to day-to-day living. Economists should stay out of politics. It's one of
the reasons that at no point in either the Declaration of Indipendance or
the Constitution that businesses are given rights are even given
consideration except in regards of taxation of inter-state commerce. People
should have seperation of government and religion and that includes the
worship of wealth.
If it's so damn good how come it doesn't exist anymore? If it provided such
a superior governmental system providing the maximum return on investment
why did it go away? Why did they instead elect to go with a king? Futher,
explain how such an anarchic system can be expanded without demonstrating
the exact same sorts of scaling problems consensual democracies such as
ancient Greek ran into? It's one thing to rule a few 10's of thousands of
people who are related, share world-models and have limited resources and
quite another to rule 4+ Billion people who speak hundreds if not thousands of languages and concommittent cultural beliefs?
Thought crimes and such are not a result of any political system but a
result of the psychology of people. Please be so kind as to demonstrate
(along with my previous questions I am still waiting on) how a political
system effects the basic psychological development of the participants.
Further, explain how the belief in the resolving power of money is any
different than the resolving power of Buddha? You seem to be claiming that
if we pray to the all mighty dollar all will be right with the world.
You seriously expect any reasonable person to be satisfied with such a

result of those same game theories. Are you claiming that such free market
based systems will abandon game theory when it clearly provides insight into
how those free markets operate?
The simply fact that one has a constitution that guarantees certain rights is
*not* a guarantee that others won't find those rights threatening and want to
take them away (see Hirshleifer's two alternatives above). And your assertion
is that if we go to a free market anarchy then we no longer have to worry
about anyone telling us what we can and can't do? Please be so kind as to
demonstrate why a free market anarchy will prohibit monopolistic
organizations who would be just as threatened by armed individuals as any
other centralized organization?
Where do I observe them? Give examples. Whose reality? Are you seriously
claiming that there is one absolute reality?
Governments and religions *ARE* people. There are times where I think you
have said the stupidist thing possible and then you keep typing. Individuals
are the ones who killed the Jews, put pepper spray in the eyes of
demonstrators, and just about everything else that gets done.
I don't know, never looked at the numbers *AND* it isn't my job to refute
it. *IT IS* your job to prove it since it is *YOUR* claim and apparently has
some relevance to your thesis' validity. The number of laws at any given time
is irrelevant and immaterial to my position (nice attempt at a straw man).
It is plain stupidity to make claims and not have a clue as to the reality.
I shure as hell won't be asking people to put their lives in my hands unless
I could address such issues in a manner that they would feel comfortable with.
Gut feelings are almost always wrong. The mere fact that you feel that we
should take such claims at face value is a clear indication of what kind of
worth you place in others. You believe yourself to be an angel apparently.
Oh, and for the record. Studies of deaths during the 1800's indicate that
the vast majority were accidental self-inflicted gunshot wounds, far more
than the Indians or other 3rd parties inflicted combined.

@_subject: Free Market Anarchy (Beck's Folly) - Fundamental flaw 
The fundamental flaw with the justification of a Free Market Anarchy and
also the fundamental condemnation of Democracy is that of taxation.
However, the theory of democracy does not in any way address the issues of
taxation, only how laws are made and what the boundaries on those laws are.
In fact, until about the first third of this century there was NO personal
taxation in this country at the federal level. Clear prima facia , and to use
Beck's verbage 'real', evidence that the assertion that personal taxation and
democracy are irrevocably wedded. Ask yourself, why is it that no free
market anarchist *ever* mentions commenality in humanity? Why do their have
inherent and implicit in their systems a class structure? They would have
you believe this is natural, it is not. Class structures are reflections of
the beliefs of the people, not some fundamental law of nature.
Furhermore, Free Market Anarchy does not address the issues of protection
from abuse. It does not recognize in any manner any mechanism for redress of
grievances unless you happen to be one of the few who controls the wealth.
It further assumes that those who don't have wealth will willingly take this
station in life as a given and simply work for those who do have wealth and
accept without resentment that they will forever be denied any sort of
opportunity to change their station in life except at the whim of the power
brokers. It further does not in any way address issues of life, liberty, or
pursuits of happines - only monetary wealth. It is clear that having wealth
does not in any manner guarantee any sort of empathy for others in the holder.
If anthing, history demonstrates that such 'lords of wealth' are pragmatic
about collecting wealth to the point of predation.
This argument from the specific to the general is fundamentaly flawed and
the conclusion suffers because of it.
Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. How that power is
obtained, by vote or specie, is irrelevant as clearly shown by history.
Some hold that the majority of the populace suffer taxation at the point of
a gun. This assertion is also false. There have historicaly been several
political parties which have promised to eliminate personal taxation. In
every case those parties could not control more than a truly minimal
percentage of the vote. Yes, people say taxation is too high, they do not
hold the assertion that taxes should be completely eliminated.
Free Market Anarchies are doomed to the same sort of death, and if ever
implimented the same sorts of abuse, as all other non-democratic systems.
Also, recognize that those who support such systems have a set of commen
character flaws. First, they can't differentiate the implimentation from the
theory of political systems. They would have you believe that if a given
implimentation of a system is flawed or broken than all systems of that ilk
are then broken or flawed. Clearly history does not support such assertions.
In short, they would throw the baby out with the bathwater. Secondly, these
in general are the sorts of people who find glee when they see a polic
officer run over in the street. Do you seriously believe that anyone this
cold and uncarring would not hesitate for an instant in putting pepper spray
in your eyes? Thirdly, they express a view which I call Theory X equality.
In short, as long as they are the ones making the profit, the fact that you
suffer for it, justly or not, is irrelevant and justified. In more prosaic
words, the ends *always* justifies the means. An assertion that history also
does not support.

I also agree. It is high time those of who believe in our rights put their
money where our mouth is.
But, why do we need a lawyer? We have the right to represent ourselves, why
let somebody who has a intimate stake in the status quo represent us?
Has there ever been a law suite brought against the Supreme Court or
Congress claiming their actions were unconstitutional? The amendment
relating to taxation for a start, repeal individual taxation and return to
the system originaly intended by the founding fathers. Also, let's start
something relating to the 2nd. We should also move to have an amendment
which requires all existing and future legislation pass constitutional
review *prior* to being voted into existance. We should also move to have an
amendment that *requires* government employees be responsible for their
actions on a individual basis and eliminate the protection that Congress has
put in place, that is *not* in the Constitution. We should further move to
have the seizure laws revoked because they are not constitutional. The drug
laws should also be attacked on that level as well.

It was the case in all places. The Wild West simply wasn't that wild.
Damn, I have this book - but not here, at my shop apparently - that was
written by a eastern newspaper report who was in California, to write the
book, and he described San Francisco in the 1800's during the first gold
rushes. He doesn't note significant violence. What really makes the book
interesting is that the reporter took the 'long way' to California - across
Panama via coastal steamers and such. Very interesting descriptions. I'll
make note and get the book next time I'm out there and post to the list for
Would you happen to remember your source? Nothing I have read has ever
mentioned a 1000/year homicide count in San Francisco - ever.
That's interesting since this is a specific and commen example of free
market anarchy supporters, the low violence rates in the Cali. gold fields
during the rush. In particular J.D. Davidson & Lord W. Rees-Mogg go to great
lengths at a couple of places in their book "The Sovereign Individual" to
hold it us as a 'model anarchy'.
Me thinks something is going on here below the covers when both sides of the
discussion use the same example (which is why I intentionaly don't use it
but wait for others to bring it up).
If you read "My Life as a Indian" this might change your view of how it was
in that period. "The Texas Rangers" also has quite a lot to say about what
the Indian wars were like in Texas (not really since there really wasn't
much). It is interesting to note that when the cattle drives started in the
1800's the people oppossed didn't pick up a gun and fight as a rule, they
hired lawyers and sued the cattle owners for damages to their farms and
ranches. This one was one of the primary forces behind the closing of the
fronteir - putting up barbed wire - the cattle barons kept losing the cases.
Let us know how your research goes.
See above books as well as the Time*Life series I mentioned in a previous
submission. I would wager that from 1800 to 1900 there were less than a
dozen face-to-face shoot-outs at high-noon, if any at all. There is also a
very good book that covers the French and Spanish explorations of the
southwest starting in the late 1500's up to the early 1800's when they were
either forced out by political agreements or force. I believe the University
of New Mexico puts it out. If I stumble across it (I'll keep an eye out for
it) I'll get identifiying info. Very good book, but a mother to read.
Generaly people shot each other with rifles from a distance or back-shots.
But the fact is that most, stats put it as high as 60%, of all homicides
(accidental or intentional) were people shooting themselves with their own
weapon by accident. These sorts of incidents were clearly much higher than
Indians or homicide.

Thanks, I'll check them out as I am unaware of their position.
Actualy, his research is one of the reasons that I am so interested in an
actual lawsuit.
What if somebody were to go for several years with no contact at all with
the IRS, and no intention of making contact. Then when approached that
person makes enough noise to guarantee that they will be going to court.
What would it then take to bush-whack the beggars? What is the absolute last
point that your defence must be revealed prior to your presenting your case
to the jury? The reason I use the first person is because to me it seems
critical that no lawyer is actualy used in the defence. As I understand it,
and I ain't no lawyer, there are some actions that a defendent may do if
representing themselves that lawyers are prohibited from doing. Among them
is stating the obvious fact, if the jurors don't believe the law is just
they may refuse to find for that reason. If the Constitution and the actual
record of votes in concert with the general feeling of excess regarding this
matter doesn't prove the case, what will?

Technological, societal, political, religous, whatever non-confrontational

be as equals. If the fed's want to do something they have to get a lot of
the states to go along with it or else they don't get the resources. The
states can't get too far out of line because of their ability to represent

The problem now, fundamentaly to my view, is that the states are seen as

Seems to me that this is false. To have a truly free communcations medium we
must have no censors. The very fact that crypto is involved guarantees that
it isn't free. The use of crypto itself is a form of censorship if you don't
have the key.
No, it isn't.
Tell that to publius. 200+ years later and we still fight over who wrote
what and they didn't even use a simple substitution cypher. The secret to
anonymity is the same as keeping a secret, those who know keep their mouths
How is crypto going to keep them from kicking the turning the phones off,
turning the power off, and kicking the front door in? It isn't.
Speech can't be truly free as long as any party can censor the traffic.
Then be so kind as to explain people who are intentionaly trying to force
legal cases in order to challenge standards? This is a clear 1-to-1 mapping
to flogging (per your example).
Unfortunately cyberspace can't exist without meatspace.
Only if you don't have a clue as to the technical, social and economic milieu
that it exists within. Show me a way to run a remailer program without a
computer which exists in meatspace and your proposition might work.
You have a small imagination. The amount of space in cyberspace in no more
than the sum total of all the hard drives in use on the network or network
accessible at any given time. It's measured in terabytes but that is hardly
Your standards are pretty low when one considers that the largest databases
on the planet are measured in terabytes (1,000 gig's).
Really? Then please be so kind as to pay my monthy bills related to Internet
access. I assure you they are far from 'cheap'.
No, it must provide no moderation on traffic. All anonymous access buys one
is reasonable deniability, a far cry from free communcations; and in fact
fundamentaly unrelated to the concept of free speech.
Doesn't make it correct either, the proof is in the pudding.
In fact the validity of a thesis should in no way ever rest on the
personality or reputation capital, it should rest solely on what can be
proven and tested about it.

Only in your collective wet dreams. Libertaria as described by Tim,
yourself, and others will never come to pass in that form.

If you want to be considered seperate from the US *AND* you don't want to

Subsidize means to pay, the government does not pay as a rule pay the

'mere ferrets'? You obviously don't know much about the predatory nature of
the mustella clan (ferrets, weasels, badgers, etc.). From a predator
stand-point they are excellent hunters, routinely killing prey *three* times
their body weight by themselves. By no means is that routine of predators of
any ilk other than felines (statisticaly hitting 70% kill rates on average,
dogs do good if they hit 40% in packs). You should do a little research into
mustella negripe, the American Black-footed Ferret (distantly related to the
European Ferret at best).
No, being a ferret is *not* an insult but rather a compliment. Pound for
pound if you got to pick a fight don't pick one with felines or mustellids
they *will* kick your weasy little butt.
And yes, I am a cat & ferret lover.

A reasonable motto should be something like:
I'm all for a political faction, they really don't have to be as organized

concepts of multiple political parties with their own popularist views has
become truly effective because of the impact of technology in particularly
on concept expression, and communications.
What needs to happen is a small group of suitably inspired whiz kids need to
get together and form a complete plan for creating legal cases to decide the
respective aspects of the 10th.
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. In some manner the question of whether the first sentence is an implicit
limitation of *all* laws and regulations at the federal level needs to be
tested. In other words, each and every law *must* trace its existance to a
specific set of sentences in the Constitution. If it could be found to be so
then each and every law and regulation at the federal would have to pass
constitutional review at every stage of its existance within the federal
government. Then a case needs to found of some situation say the founding of
a church based on smoking marijuana was a illegal entity under the 1st where
it is found that such organizations were illegal (rather trivial I suspect).
At this point the wording of the 1st becomes *much* more specific.
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Under this light it becomes glaringly clear that not only is Congress not
allowed to even discuss legislation respecting claims of religion. Per the
10th that would fall to the individual states to resolve under their
individual constitutions. This would force many of the major social issues
onto a regional basis where they could be dealt with in a plurality of ways.
Issues regarding infringement of private ownership of weapons becomes
glaringly clear in that light. It simply isn't a federal issue. Per the 10th
it must be dealt with at the state level. Other issues such as no searches
except under warrant issued with probable causes automaticaly prohibits
various sorts of searches including samples of body tissue. The issue of the
use of federal military troops for any sorts of operations except those
respecting the operations of the defence of the US would be clearly decided.
Such silliness as the Supreme Court finding that teachers have the
Constitutional right to search kids because of supposed criminal wrong doing
is clearly shown for what it is, an violation of an individuals civil
rights. Warrants can only be issues on probably cause. Under these sorts of
conditions the various consensual crimes our government now routinely
practices would end. This is vary scary to the status quo crowd. And here
lies the rub, the initial 10th test cast must be irrefusable concerning the
10th. The question then becomes, "What is the issue?". What law or aspect
thereof is found so compelling that the Supreme Court *must* accept the case
for ruling *and* must find in favor of Constitutional review. For maximum
impact somebodies life must hang in the balance in such a manner that some
fundamental question of legal lineage is brought forth. This reduces the
issue to its most fundamental, "Is the right of the state more important
than the life of the individual?"
Why some lawyer has not used this basic question in the numerous murder
trials is truly amazing. If he wins a legal precidence is set. If he looses
and gets to appeal. Then walk that appeals train right up to the fundamental
question of the 10th. Forcing the Supreme Court to either reject, stating
clearly their answer in favor of the majority, or else to review and find
that laws must pass Constitutional muster. Either way the question gets

Seems to me that the fundamental question that should be asked here is:
Does the 10th require strict compliance with the wording of the Constitution
per the first sentence of the 10th or explain specificaly what
Constitutional sentences are being used to justify the 10th and by extension
the entire Constitution itself being exempt of mandatory constitutional
review at all stages of a laws life.
This is perhaps the key question that needs to be asked in order to properly
understand the language of the Constitution. Viewed in the light of strict
compliance the wording of the Constitution becomes remarkably free of
If the 10th is taken literaly it can only be interpreted as saying:
 -  The federal government is required to justify all its rules,
    regulations, and offical actions within the explicit context of
    the text of the Constitution.
 -  In situations where there is no clear ruling the issue is remanded
    to the states for resolution per their own individual constitutions.
    Or in cases where the state constitution would not apply to the people.
 -  "to the people" needs to be interpreted as meaning to be left to
    individual discretion and therefore fundamentaly exempt from review
    at the state or federal level.
 -  This is the level a behaviour or action becomes a Constitutionaly
    recognized right exempt from future regulation per the 9th.
 -  The above interpretations are open to change per the methods described
    for Constitutional Amendments.
 -  "Congress shall make no law..." & "shall not be infringed." become
    much clearer and less open to federal level inteference.
Some of the results of this would be:
 -  The entire 'Drug War' machine would grind to a halt
 -  Many people in jail on solely drug possession and use charges
    with no other jailable charge would be released immediatly
 -  NASA would require some sort of Constitutional amendment to continue
    to operate
 -  The interaction and use between the US military and the state and
    local level regarding law enforcement would cease immediately
 -  CDC would require Constitutional amendment funding
 -  Issues of what is and what is not 'legal' speech would be resolved
    at the state level.
 -  Confiscation of property without compensation would be completely
    abandoned.
 -  The recognition that police have no fundamental rights under the
    Constitution because it in no way draws a distinction between
    polic & a non-police citizen. Laws can not draw distinction of
    this sort at the federal level.
 -  Each and every search *must* be at the direct interaction of a
    magistrate *and* must explicity describe what is being searched
    for *and further* demonstrate probable cause within a much more
    precise environment.
 -  The recognition that laws based on the distinction of 'victimless'
    and 'victim' crimes is a distinction that can't be drawn at the
    Constitutional level.
 -  A action or behaviour is either protected or it isn't.
This would create a set of states with quite a range of constitutional
environments. I can just see the "Mormon State of Utah" where the official
constitutional religion is Mormonism by amendment.

OH, that is truly funny...
Just 'cause I happened to be raised by hippies doesn't mean I am a hippie.
Backfield in motion...Sugar Sugar...
Exactly. Thank you for being so obliging.
Who's Socrates?
A more interesting question is whether the technology would have impacted his
base psychology...
I know this, way down deep there is a fundamental dialog between people and
all the technology in the world doesn't change that. Those base topics are
what define human societies. If this weren't so then how can the human
experience be so stable over recorded history & cultures? Why do we discuss
the exact same sorts of questions all societies & individuals have asked?
But, to counter your suggestion, please be so kind as to demonstrate your
evidence where the method of expression might have changed the basic
fundamentals of his dialogue? What are those fundamental issues that you
claim have changed so radicaly? While your'e at it, how about extrapolating
that nifty keen cliological analysis to say 500 years into the future and
explain your own biases and bigottries? You can leave the whip and chains
out of the dialog, those never change.
I would propose that there are more fundamental issue than the level of
technology. For example, consider the impact of experimentation on a
basicaly experiential world-view as that commen in ancient Greece. As
another example, consider the reaction when pi was shown to be irrational
and this knowledge was banned upon pain of death. Clearly we have the
technology yet we have not escaped the more base human experience. The
reality would seem to indicate that no, the most base messages of Socrates,
Sun Tzu, Christ, or the cypherpunks are still the same old ones...
 -  People are people, people are strange
 -  What makes one person happy is guaranteed to piss somebody else off
 -  Most people will never figure the first two out even if you tell
    them the answers
Uh...like cold day in hell...
I'm beginning to think your attention span is tuned to those 30 second
blip-verts...and who asked? Are the voices back already?
"convey the totality"? What kind of double-speak bullshit is that? Look junior, the absolutely *ONLY* way to express the 'totality' of an
experience is to be the one doing the experience. You can pop all the
moddies and daddies you wanna but it's still a pale imitation; a rose it is
not in any language. Now unless you have just instantly warped our happy
assess into the far flung future we are a long walk from plugging brains
together, nic's & protocols not withstanding.
Well that's good, you shouldn't be as disappointed at your steady failures.
My suggestion, don't quit your day job, assuming your old enough to have a

Um, I believe that went from the late 1500's to the early 1700's at best.
Ol' Joe Smith lived in the early and late 1800's nearly a hundred years
after the traditional Great Awakening. Is your claim that there was a second Great Awakending or are you saying the traditional (if you will)
dating is incorrect?
Actualy, to be accurate his name was Vlad Teppish. He was eventualy killed by
his lord for carrying on excesses such as killing a woman because she let her
husband walk around with a tattered coat. Dracul and Dracula are derived
from dragon and imply a connection with the devil (which also derives its
own existance from this lexical tree).
Doesn't the use of 'perceived' imply some a priori assumptions about the base structure of reality and in fact imply a more atomistic issue, that
of conceptual viability? How does an opinion become atomistic if in order
to express it we must invoke other equaly critical (or atomistic)
expressions? Further, without testing a 'perceived' fact is nothing but an
That doesn't change the fact that the opinion, anonymous or not, originated

lowest level it is nothing more than a description of an individuals
beliefs about reality and their place in it and clearly has impact on the
sorts of ideas that are expressible in them.
Perhaps opinion & fact are unwittingly being confused. Opinions tell the
observer about the holder of the opinion, not the subject the opinion is
direct toward.
Science is about how to ask questions, it is NOT concerned with the results
directly. Science is a non-intuitive mechanism whereby we can regulate how
we think about the world around us. What to do with the results is engineering.
Science itself is heuristic.
There is no 'scientific truth', THE main axiom of science is that everything
is open to review and change in responce to the observation and description
of the item under studies interactions with the environment around it.
Only if they changed their opinions *because* of the expression of your
opinions. Otherwise we are left with independant discovery. Influence is
the ability of one theory to cause the holder of another theory to add
data or tests that could potentialy alter the outcome of that original
theory. The results may or may not support either of the original theories
or could even cause a 3rd theory to be born.
The more people agree with your opinions AND are willing to act on them is
a measure of influence. Also, the fact that others may in fact be motivated
to act because they *disagree* with you also is clearly a possibility you
don't address. Never confuse popularity with influence.
This runs counter to your assumption regarding the number of line-plane
intersections. If the line is not geometricaly 'straight' it can in fact have
zero, one, or more intersections. This causes a problem with this part of the
conclusion, you are using the axiom as proof of the assertion (the axiom).

While I clearly put the beginning of the movement too early (I always get

Hardly, the Renaissance started toward the beginning of the 1400's (eg
Galileo) and ended by the end of the 1500's (eg Newton). Did you know that
Galileo died the same year that Newton was born? Some contemporary of Newton
made the comment that the world could support no more than 1 such intellect
at a time.
After thinking about this I am certain that you are speaking of a movement
other than the Great Awakening. I can't remember or find a convenient name
for the religous/ethical awakening that occured prior to the Civil War.
In thinking about this it occurs to me that immediately after each such
occurance of a 'Great Awakening' there is a war of global (or at least
what passes for the know world) proportions.
Fortunately I can lay claim to being either the last of the baby boomers
or the first of the gen-x'ers depending on whose definition you use.
Personaly, I consider the labels spin-doctorisms intended to focus folks on
the differences instead of the similarities.
Actualy 'dracul' is a word that means devil, it has the same roots as
'dragon'. Neither father or son used that in their name, it's what others
called Vlad when they weren't calling him the Impaler.
Yes, but each of those were individuals. Opinions are tied to individuality
and not geography or chronological ordering. What you actualy have is a
group of individual opinions that once the observer is aware of the set then
forms their own opinion of what the original opinions meant.
A better and more fundamental question:
How do we know what we think is what we think?
If you can't demonstrate this then you have no way of demonstrating there is
even an 'out there' to see.
The point that always seemed clear to me is that there is an implicit
assumption with the whole mind/body question, in short; there is more to
reality than what we experience. Therefore our experience of reality is
fundamentaly different than reality. A further problem I see is that the
implied assumption that the observer is seperate and isolated from that
being observed.
You are using a fundamentaly different science than I use. At no time does
science assume there is a truth, only interactions that can be manipulated
and are simple enough in their core interactions for us to understand.
Science is nothing more than a methodology for asking questions that fit
particular and well defined forms. At the core of this is a basic assumption
about nature, it is homogenous and isomorphic.
Please be so kind why heuristics is the only thing we got? Seems to me that
serendipity has raised its head more than once. As I understand heuristic
algorithms (ie rule base) is that they pre-suppose a system for goal meeting
and then go through a itterative process comparing the current position with
the goal and then reducing that distance.

of them were as well. He also told his son to ask his wife to wait a moment
to die while he finished his cyphers (calculations).
If you don't know how to ask a question in a scientific manner you can't
test it. Science itself doesn't say anything about the results directly
other than they are homogenous and isomorphic, the observer does however when
we examine the goals and reasons for the experiment in the first place. To
observe nature requires a fundamentaly different methodolgy than 'commen
sense' observation. Further, the realization that there are processes in
nature that are fundamentaly un-repeatable is what forced the creation of
statistics and the study of families of events.
Replication of experiments comes from a base assumption in science (which
unlike other axiomatic systems are open to refutation) that nature is
fundamentaly homogenous and isomorphic, in other words the rules of nature
are the same irrespective of geography. Should we find such a non-homogenous
or non-isomorphism in nature then the fundamental reliance on science as we
impliment it now would be shown wrong. The flip side to this is that if the universe turns out to be so arranged
then we have in effect a non-relativistic frame of reference because we have
now proven by exception that a given point or particle in the universe is
truly unique and identifiable through some mechanism.
No, that is business management. At no point in an engineering study is the
issue of cost v price examined. Study Nikola Tesla to understand why your
statement is fallacious.
Popularity means that the issue is well known, influence is that people use
it as a reason for their actions.
I agree that they are linked. I don't think that in the grand scheme of
getting through life they are nearly as important as some would have us
believe. I personaly am more interested in the fundamental question of
whether the meme or paradigm works in the sense of providing me the return
on my resource investment that I intended. I guess a simpler way to put it
is that intellectual capital should not be avaluated by the same methodology
we use to select books or movies to buy.

From Issue                                  VLAD DRACULA
An intriguing figure in the fifteenth century
   [IMAGE] By Benjamin H. Leblanc    valmont at lanzen.net

   University of Montreal, Canada
   In less than two years from now the Count will celebrate his 100th
   birthday, and many Dracula enthusiasts from all around the world
   intend to underline this event. Of course, almost everybody has heard
   about this nosferatu: through movies featuring Max Schreck, Bela
   Lugosi, Christopher Lee or Gary Oldman; in several books - among which
   the recent Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice; or even in bedtime stories
   told to us in our childhood. We all have an idea of who or what the
   Count is. However, on the other hand, Vlad Tepes Dracula, the
   historical figure who inspired Bram Stoker for his novel, is
   definitely less known. The centennial of the gothic masterpiece
   provides us with a good pretext to dive back into the life of this
   machiavellian fifteenth century leader - an initiative that will
   enable us to better appreciate the work of Stoker.
   Vlad Tepes was born in November or December 1431, in the fortress of
   Sighisoara, Romania. His father, Vlad Dracul, at that time appointed
   military governor of Transylvania by the emperor Sigismund, had been
   inducted into the Order of the Dragon about one year before. The order
   - which could be compared to the Knights of the Hospital of St. John
   or even to the Teutonic Order of Knights - was a semimilitary and
   religious society, originally created in 1387 by the Holy Roman
   Emperor and his second wife, Barbara Cilli. The main goals of such a
   secret fraternal order of knights was mainly to protect the interests
   of Catholicism, and to crusade against the Turks. There are different
   reasons why this society is so important to us. First, it provides an
   explanation for the name "Dracula;" "Dracul," in Romanian language,
   means "Dragon", and the boyars of Romania, who knew of Vlad Tepes'
   father induction into the Order of the Dragon, decided to call him
   "Dracul." "Dracula," a diminutive which means "the son of Dracul," was
   a surname to be used ultimately by Vlad Tepes. A second major role of
   this Order as a source of inspiration for Stoker's evil character is
   the Order's official dress - a black cape over a red garment - to be
   worn only on Fridays or during the commemoration of Christ's Passion.
   In the winter of 1436-1437, Dracul became prince of Wallachia (one of
   the three Romanian provinces) and took up residence at the palace of
   Tirgoviste, the princely capital. Vlad Tepes followed his father and
   lived six years at the princely court. In 1442, for political reasons,
   Dracula and his younger brother Radu were taken hostage by the Sultan
   Murad II; Dracula was held in Turkey until 1448, while his brother
   Radu decided to stay there until 1462. This Turkish captivity surely
   played an important role in Dracula's upbringing; it must be at this
   period that he adopted a very pessimistic view of life. Indeed, the
   Turks set him free after informing him of his father's assassination
   in 1447 - organized by Vladislav II. He also learned about his older
   brother's death - Mircea was the eldest legitimate son of Dracul - and
   how he had been tortured and buried alive by the boyars of Tirgoviste.
   At 17 years old, Vlad Tepes Dracula, supported by a force of Turkish
   cavalry and a contingent of troops lent to him by pasha Mustafa
   Hassan, made his first major move toward seizing the Wallachian
   throne. But another claimant, no other than Vladislav II himself,
   defeated him only two months later. In order to secure his second and
   major reign over Wallachia, Dracula had to wait until July of 1456,
   when he had the satisfaction of killing his mortal enemy and his
   father's assassin. Vlad then began his longest reign - 6 years -
   during which he committed many cruelties, and hence established his
   controversed reputation.
   His first major act of revenge was aimed at the boyars of Tirgoviste
   for the killing of his father and his brother Mircea. On Easter Sunday
   of what we believe to be 1459, he arrested all the boyar families who
   had participated to the princely feast. He impaled the older ones on
   stakes while forcing the others to march from the capital to the town
   of Poenari. This fifty-mile trek was quite grueling, and those who
   survived were not permitted to rest until they reached destination.
   Dracula then ordered them to build him a fortress on the ruins of an
   older outpost overlooking the Arges river. Many died in the process,
   and Dracula therefore succeeded in creating a new nobility and
   obtaining a fortress for future emergencies. What is left today of the
   building is identified as Castle Dracula.
   [IMAGE] Vlad became quite known for his brutal punishment techniques;
   he often ordered people to be skinned, boiled, decapitated, blinded,
   strangled, hanged, burned, roasted, hacked, nailed, buried alive,
   stabbed, etc. He also liked to cut off noses, ears, sexual organs and
   limbs. But his favorite method was impalement on stakes, hence the
   surname "Tepes" which means "The Impaler" in the Romanian language.
   Even the Turks referred to him as "Kaziglu Bey," meaning "The Impaler
   Prince." It is this technique he used in 1457, 1459 and 1460 against
   Transylvanian merchants who had ignored his trade laws. The raids he
   led against the German Saxons of Transylvania were also acts of
   proto-nationalism in order to protect and favour the Wallachian
   commerce activities.
   There are many anecdotes about the philosophy of Vlad Tepes Dracula.
   He was for instance particularly known throughout his land for his
   fierce insistence on honesty and order. Almost any crime, from lying
   and stealing to killing, could be punished by impalement. Being so
   confident in the effectiveness of his law, Dracula placed a golden cup
   on display in the central square of Tirgoviste. The cup could be used
   by thirsty travelers, but had to remain on the square. According to
   the available historic sources, it was never stolen and remained
   entirely unmolested throughout Vlad's reign. Dracula was also very
   concerned that all his subjects work and be productive to the
   community. He looked upon the poor, vagrants and beggars as thieves.
   Consequently, he invited all the poor and sick of Wallachia to his
   princely court in Tirgoviste for a great feast. After the guests ate
   and drank, Dracula ordered the hall boarded up and set on fire. No one
   survived.
   In the beginning of 1462, Vlad launched a campaign against the Turks
   along the Danube river. It was quite risky, the military force of
   Sultan Mehmed II being by far more powerful than the Wallachian army.
   However, during the winter of 1462, Vlad was very successful and
   managed to gain many victories. To punish Dracula, the Sultan decided
   to launch a full-scale invasion of Wallachia. Of course, his other
   goal was to transform this land into a Turkish province and he entered
   Wallachia with an army three times larger than Dracula's. Finding
   himself without allies, Vlad, forced to retreat towards Tirgoviste,
   burned his own villages and poisoned the wells along the way, so that
   the Turkish army would find nothing to eat or drink. Moreover, when
   the Sultan, exhausted, finally reached the capital city, he was
   confronted by a most gruesome sight: thousands of stakes held the
   remaining carcasses of some 20,000 Turkish captives, a horror scene
   which was ultimately nicknamed the "Forest of the Impaled." This
   terror tactic deliberately stage-managed by Dracula was definitely
   successful; the scene had a strong effect on Mehmed's most
   stout-hearted officers, and the Sultan, tired and hungry, admitted
   defeat (it is worth mentioning that even Victor Hugo, in his Legende
   des Siecles, recalls this particular incident). Nevertheless,
   following his retreat from Wallachian territory, Mehmed left the next
   phase of the battle to Vlad's younger brother Radu, the Turkish
   favorite for the Wallachian throne. At the head of a Turkish army and
   joined by Vlad's detractors, Radu pursued his brother to Poenari
   castle on the Arges river.
   According to the legend, this is when Dracula's wife, in order to
   escape Turkish capture, committed suicide by hurling herself from the
   upper battlements, her body falling down the precipice into the river
   below - a scene exploited by Francis Ford Coppola's production. Vlad,
   who was definitely not the kind of man to kill himself, managed to
   escape the siege of his fortress by using a secret passage into the
   mountain. Helped by some peasants of the Arefu village, he was able to
   reach Transylvania where he met the new king of Hungary, Matthias
   Corvinus. However, instead of providing some help, Matthias arrested
   Dracula and imprisoned him at the Hungarian capital of Visegrad. It
   was not until 1475 that Vlad was again recognized as the prince of
   Wallachia, enjoying a very short third reign. In fact, he was
   assassinated toward the end of December 1476.
   We do not know exactly why Bram Stoker chose this fifteenth century
   Romanian prince as a model for his fictional character. Some scholars
   have proposed that Stoker had a friendly relationship with a Hungarian
   professor from the University of Budapest, Arminius Vambery (Hermann
   Vamberger) , and it is likely that this man gave Stoker some
   information about Vlad Tepes Dracula. Moreover, the fact that Dr.
   Abraham Van Helsing mentions his "friend Arminius" in the 1897 novel
   as the source of his knowledge on Vlad seems to support this
   hypothesis. It should also be kept in mind that the only real link
   between the historical Dracula (1431-1476) and the modern literary
   myth of the vampire is in fact the 1897 novel; Stoker made use of
   folkloric sources, historic references and some of his own life
   experiences to create his composite creature. On the other hand, it is
   worth mentioning that Vlad Dracula's political detractors - mainly
   German Saxons - made use of the other meaning of the Romanian word
   "Dracul" - "Devil" - in order to blacken the prince's reputation.
   Could the association of the words "Dragon" and "Devil" in Romanian
   language explain an earlier link between Vlad Tepes and vampirism?
   Today, as Romania opens itself to the tourism industry, many "Dracula
   Tours" are being offered throughout the country. Two months ago, the
   author of this article attended one of them, organized by Bravo Group
   and designed by the Transylvanian Society of Dracula. This particular
   Tour includes the most important historical places related with Vlad
   Tepes, such as 15th century town of Sighisoara - Vlad's birth place;
   the Snagov Monastery - where, according to legend, Vlad is said to
   have been buried after his assassination; Castle Bran - which has been
   in the past erroneously described by officials of the Romanian Tourist
   Ministry as Castle Dracula; the Poenari fortress; the village of Arefu
   - where many Dracula legends are still told; the city of Brasov -
   where Vlad led raids against the German Saxons; and, of course, Curtea
   Domneasca - Dracula's palace in Bucharest. The Tour also covers the
   folklorical aspects of the fictional Dracula. For instance, one will
   find oneself eating the meal Jonathan Harker ate at The Golden Crown
   in Bistrita, and sleeping at Castle Dracula Hotel - built no so long
   ago on the Borgo Pass, approximately where the fictional castle of the
   Count is supposed to be. If you have another trip to the Bahamas
   planned for next Christmas and are a fan of Stoker's literary work,
   maybe should you reconsider your decision?
   As for the 100th birthday of the novel, may you celebrate "freely and
   of your own will!"

To hell with gassing them, the issue is the bar-b-que that occurred after.
Something like 18 children were murdered and the US government and the
then Texas (bitch) govenor Ann Richards were complicent in the nefarious
deed. Someday she and every agent that participated will stand before a jury,
unfortunately the odds are it will be the jury of history and not their
Why were those kids deprived of the modern conveniences? Clearly the answer
"David and his followers wouldn't surrender" doesn't hold water. Those kids
deserve NO punishment for actions others *may* have committed, they were a
victim - whether of David or the actions of the gov. reps. is irrellevant.
Those people were given a public trust, they not only abused it but failed
miserably in its resolution. They must pay the price. Saying "I was
following orders" has no place in a democratic society anywhere; the
individual MUST be held accountable for their actions and they should not be
able to shirk that responsibility nor pass it off to some 3rd party.
Further, irrispective of their job or position in society or the government
the responsibilities AND rights of the individual must not be infringed AND
must take predidence over all other duties or responsibilties.

                   POLL: YOUNG ADULTS WANT BETTER GOVERNMENT
     graphic November 19, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:57 p.m. EST (0357 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most young adults don't necessarily want to
     reduce government's role in America but want it to do a better job,
     according to a new poll. As for themselves, however, they see their
     future not in government work but in private business.
     The survey by pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter was released
     Wednesday at the kickoff of a project by corporations and nonprofit
     groups to increase public trust in government.
     In the poll, 40 percent of respondents said government can help them
     achieve their goals in life, compared with the 48 percent who said
     government programs and policies are a hindrance.
     But a large majority, 71 percent, answered that government could
     help with better leadership and management, and 60 percent would
     prefer improving the government over simply reducing its size and
     power.
     On working in government themselves, 66 percent said a career in the
     private sector is more appealing. The telephone survey of 505
     Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 was conducted October 29 and
     30. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

They are they same if we ignore the fact that there is 50+ years between
the 1st (1700-1750) and the 2nd (1800-1850).
Then you should go back and read them some more. In fact, if you still have
the originals they include in the header the URL where I got the data from.
Take the 10 minutes and go over and take a look at them. All three were
related to religous revivalism in one form or another. The 1st (which
itself some consider to be the second occurance of a previous movement
as indicated in the title) did not occur in the 1800's which was the
original precis that somebody threw out
I did some looking around as well and other then Norton, yourself, and
whoever it was that made the original claim all references I can find to
the Great Awakening refer to the 1700-1750 event(s) as the first one to
occur in the America's. If I can find my Norton Anthology I'll take a
look at it, though it is 15+ years old.

@_subject: My last comment on Great Awakening... 
It has been claimed that the original claim by Bob and anonymous was that
the first Great Awakening ended by the late 18'th century. This is a
complete fabrication. The original claim put forth clearly references dates
in the 1800's as the date of the first instance, clearly 50-100 years in
error from the original Great Awakening that occurred between 1700-1750. In
my original posting I (thought) made it clear that I didn't quite know when
the original event occurred but was certain it ended prior to the late
1700's which would clearly pre-date the original claim. I subsequently took
the time to provide references for those citation and clearly indicated
where my memory was in error, and even took the time to explain my confusion
regarding the 'Beacon on the Hill' movement. In responce Bob and apparently
anonymous made it clear that they saw no reason to do 'homework'
irrespective of the impact of historical accuracy on their claims.
Make up your own mind on the validity of the claims.

Forwarded message:
Hi Monty,
I have a couple of questions...
Any particular methodology you might care to share on stopping WWII?
Being an avid amateur historian concerning WWII I am very much interested in
any insight you might have.
As to taxation and withholding:
incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. [25 February 1913.] Notice the date of implimentation, considerably before WWII, it is in fact
the year before the US became involved in WWI. Perhaps you meant WWI instead
of WWII? Citizens of the US have been paying taxes since 1914.
What war? The taxes came about because of issues other than fighting a war
which hadn't even happened yet.

          WOMAN, 80, PUT OFF GREYHOUND BECAUSE OF BIRTHDAY-GIFT PUPPY
     woman with dog November 23, 1997
     Web posted at: 6:32 p.m. EST (2332 GMT)
     TAMPA, Florida (AP) -- The bus was a Greyhound, but the driver was
     no dog lover.
     An 80-year-old woman returning home from her birthday party was
     kicked off a bus at a rural truck stop late at night because of her
     birthday present: a tiny puppy named Cookie.
     Dogs aren't allowed on Greyhound and the driver refused to make an
     exception, leaving Antonia Sanabria at the side of the road about 80
     miles from home at 3 a.m. Friday.
     A security guard summoned by the bus driver called Marion County
     sheriff's deputies -- adding to her fright.
     "When the bus pulled away and I saw all those policemen I was
     scared," Sanabria said. "I thought they were going to put me in
     jail. I don't know, I was crazy with fear. I've never gone to jail."
     What could have quickly become a terrifying ordeal for the woman,
     who walks with a crutch and has trouble hearing and seeing, instead
     became an inspiration.
     After getting her a sandwich and something to drink, police from
     different jurisdictions teamed up to ferry Sanabria all the way from
     the Ocala area to her Tampa doorstep in five different patrol cars.
     "I've never seen so many people so nice with me -- an old lady. They
     gave me love, respect, attention," she said. "Love has a lot of
     names -- compassion, respect, friendliness."
     As soon as she got home, all Sanabria wanted to do was sleep, which
     she did with her new 7-week-old Pekinese pup.
     When she woke up she found a bouquet of roses with a card that read:
     "We want you to know there are still some nice people in the world,"
     from Hillsborough sheriff's deputies in Tampa who coordinated the
     relay.
     Greyhound apologized and gave her a refund on Saturday. The
     unidentified driver, a 20-year Greyhound veteran, was suspended
     pending an investigation.
     "It's unfortunate that a lady of this age and condition would have
     something like this happen to her in the middle of the night," said
     George Gravley, a Greyhound spokesman.
     Sanabria's daughter, Sally Creel of Panama City, was outraged,
     saying: "What a low-life thing to do."
     But after the police rescue, her mother was far from bitter.
     "It was a birthday I'll never forget," Sanabria said.

               FACING CRISIS, JAPAN'S OLDEST BROKERAGE TO CLOSE
      graphic November 23, 1997
     Web posted at: 7:06 p.m. EST (0006 GMT)
     TOKYO (Reuters) -- Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd, Japan'soldest
     brokerage, will shut down, a spokesman said Monday,resulting in the
     country's biggest financial failure since World War II.
     Financial sources said a last-ditch review at a meeting ofYamaichi's
     board of directors determined it had no chance ofsurviving a credit
     crunch, shrinking business and high-profile scandals.
     The board was to hold a news conference later Monday,the spokesman
     said.
     Japanese markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday, but
     international stock markets and the yen were expected to be hit by
     the news of the shutdown amid fears of a domino effect across Japan,
     Asia and possibly beyond.
   International markets brace for possible fallout
     International markets were braced for fallout from Asia's latest
     economic crisis, the final chapter in a saga of Japanese corporate
     racketeering that has worldwide implications.
     The fear that Japan might be the next Asian domino to fallhas kept
     international monetary officials, already dealing with a crisis in
     South Korea, the world's 11th largest economy, and other Asian
     nations, on edge.
     "The initial reaction is likely to be selling pressure onthe yen and
     equity markets and a firmer opening for U.S.Treasuries," said Kirit
     Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa International in London.
     Bank of Japan sources told Reuters a special board meetingwould be
     held on Monday morning on whether to extend specialunsecured loans
     to Yamaichi.
     The Finance Ministry and central bank contacted overseasauthorities
     to alleviate global concerns, especially in U.S. and European
     markets.
   Third brokerage to collapse in past month
     The Yamaichi crisis follows the collapse in the past monthof
     second-tier brokerage Sanyo Securities Co. Ltd. and10th-ranking
     commercial bank Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.
     Finger-pointing has already started over what was behind thecollapse
     in its centenary year of a Japanese household name that has a staff
     of 7,500 at home and 33 branches abroad.
     Takeo Nishioka, secretary-general of the main opposition NewFrontier
     Party, said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's ruling Liberal
     Democratic Party had not acted decisively enough to ensure financial
     stability in Japan.
     "The Yamaichi Securities situation has undermined the trustof
     Japanese investors and international financial markets,"Nishioka
     said on national television.
   A financial system in need of reform
     The criticism added up to a unanimous view that Japan'sfinancial
     system was in urgent need of reform, deregulation and closer
     supervision -- and there was more bad news to come.
     At its core, the liquidity crunch faced by Yamaichi has beendriven
     by concern that creditors cannot pin down just how large the
     brokerage's potential losses could become, analysts said.
     "It's a story of lack of sufficient disclosure andsupervision," said
     James Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo.
     A Finance Ministry official said on Saturday there weresuspicions of
     vast off-balance sheet liabilities exceeding 200 billion yen ($1.58
     billion) from illegal trading practices.
     If that is the extent of the problem, one industry source said that
     a "white knight might be found to pick up at least some of the
     pieces.
     But there were worries the numbers may be much larger, withpossibly
     1 trillion yen ($7.9 billion) accumulated fromillegal deals since
     the 1980s.

Do you have a particular method in mind?
Such as?
So how does Tojo and his out of control Kwantung Army figure into this? Do
you feel that Japans Co-prosperity Sphere was a benign goal? How do you
consign your position that we provoked Japan with their behaviour in such
situations as Nanking?
The Phillipines at the time were a US protectorate, is your position that we
should have simply turned them over without a fight? Korea was ceeded to
Japan as a result of the 1903 defeat of Russia, how is this relevant to your
position? Let's assume for a moment that the US hadn't gotten involved. The
Japanese would have eventualy gotten to Australia. Once there what would have
kept them from expanding their co-prosperity sphere eastward in order to
better stabalize their resources. When they knocked on Guam or Midway's door
should we have let them go like the Phillipines? How about the Japanese's
eventual expansion into the Allutians? Should we have simply given Alaska to
them as well? Is your position that once they had the western half of the
pacific rim they would have no pretentions on the eastern half? What do you
base this on?
Really? How so? Is your position that Germany would have benignly left the
US alone once they had defeated Britian (I am assuming of course the US
hadn't shipped resources such as oil and fuel to them)? Had the US not
gotten into the war the resources available to Germany and Japan were such
they could realisticaly have beaten the Russian. One of the reasons that
Russia had the resources to reinforce the eastern front was their ability to
remove troops from the Chinese border based on Richard Sorge's intelligence.
That depends on where they stop their rolling. Is your position that if we
had refused to support conflicts against Japan and Germany all would have
been well? Are you proposing that Germany would not have advanced with their
atomic research? Completed development on their jet-based New York Bomber?
Volunteer to who?
Justifiable war? How is the invasion of the US by British troops
significantly different than the invasion by German or Japanese troops?

Considering the relationship between the Kwantung Army and the Emporer
faith and the Japanese are a clearly mis-matched combination.
Japan beat the shit out of Russia in 1903. Had it not been for Richard
Sorge's intelligence of the situation in 1938 around Chankufeng Hill at
Vladivostok indicating the Japanese governments committment to keep the
situation from becoming a declared war and Georgi Zukhov at Khalkin Gol in
1939 the Japs would have beaten them then as well. In both situations Stalin
was up against the wall. In 1938 there are clear indications that instead of
counter-attacking he might very well have sued for peace and in the process
lost the port at Vladivostok. Had the Japanese re-inforced their army they
could have beaten the Russian troops available. Considering the lack of
roads and rail in that part of Russia it is unrealistic to expect
reinforcements to have arrived from Russia in a meaningful time frame
without recognizing the contribution Japans hesitancy in getting into a
conflict with Russia and Richard Sorge's clandestine intelligence
contributed. Had either one of those not been present then Russia would have
been eaten in little gobbles from the east and west.
Had it not been for the oil, food, and weapons we shipped Britian he would
have owned Europe in toto. It is clear from Hitlers earliest writings that
he had full intention of taking Russia. Had Stalin not had Sorge's
intelligence regarding the Japanese's intent not to attack Russia at that
time he would not have been able to pull troops from that front. Had those
troops not been pulled then both Moscow and Stalingrad *would* have fallen.
If Moscow fell Stalin fell. The Japanese also had intentions of taking
Russia but only if they could consolidate their hold in the western Pacific
Rim *and* keep America out of the conflict. China was beaten at the time.
The only thing keeping the Japanese from taking over the entire country was
two things. Their interest in expanding southward and eastward in the
Pacific to gain more oil and resource reserves (Manchuria's oil was critical
but no sufficient) and the fact that they simply didn't have enough men to
do both, expand north/west and south/east. The Japanese chose to go
south/east because they figured that with no chance of Russia attacking with
the Germans on their doorstep they could flesh out their co-prosperity sphere
and then come back once they had sufficient troops and resources *and* by
doing this in concert with the Germans there is little chance of Russia
surviving. It was also clear to many in Japan that there was no way America
could afford to stand by and watch the Pacific be taken by force. At the
time America was involved in its own expansion (ala Philipines & Guam) and
it is clear that both American and Japanese expansion in that area would not
work. The only clear path was to eliminate the American naval threat in the
Pacific. Should such a situation be achieved there was no way American could
afford to reduce the naval strength in the Atlantic by much, the Germans
were waging unrestricted submarine warfare sinking even American ships.
But this is a domino theory as well...there is one thing that studying
history and playing wargames teaches...all conflicts are a domino theory.
 fond of Hitler in the beginning of the
Mussolini may not have been fond of Hitler but he certainly admired and
respected the man, or at least that is what Ciano's diaries indicate.
Mussolini's explorations in Africa were a result of an attempt on his part
to gain respect in Hitlers eyes. Mussolini's attack on France was a gambit
to buy a seat at the surrender equal to Hitler. Mussolini's invasion of
Greece over Hitlers protests were a measure of his equality. Unfortunately
for the Italians the French & Greeks were more than capable of beating the
Italian forces. Note that the Italians were not poor forces (examine the
history of the Ariete Division in N. Africa) but rather very poorly led and
supplied. It's further of some interest to note that Japan was very diligantly
trying to get Italy to declare war on the US as late as Dec. 3, 1941.
The Japanese were certainly not bashful about taking Guam, Philipines,
Midway, the Aleutian Islands; all in their original plans. The Germans were
sinking ships as close as 20 miles off the easter seaboard. Bodies were
washing up on the beach on a regular basis all along the eastern US coast.
Keep in mind that from the tip of Siberia to the tip of Alaska is only
something like 90 miles. Now with that in mind and considering the state of
mind of Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, etc. how realistic is it to expect them to
have passed on such a plum?
Absolutely, every indication is that Hitler and the Japanese had full
intention of involving the US. Neither could afford to let the resources and
peoples of north and south America sit untouched even if they hadn't planned
to get the US involved. Consider where the only two locations for platinum
are located and the impact of that metal on high-technology.* Further
consider, had Germany and Japan worked in concert a little closer they could
have had 90% of all the oil on the planet. You think the oil shortages of
the 70's were a bitch. In such a world the US would not have been the first
on the moon (I suspect we wouldn't even be in the running). We would not in
all probability have developed the atom bomb in time; Germany would have
inhereted all the work the British did and considering that at the time they
had all the heavy water on the planet they would have had a definite
advantage. Take that and put things such as the ME-262, the New York Blitz
Bomber, the V2, the Tri-partite signatories expansionistic dreams, the
picture becomes quite nasty.
And if you think for one minute that the US could have stood against Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Australia combined under some sort of combined assault
with the technological edge going to the tri-partites you are sorely

The Japanese joined the Tri-partite on Sept. 27, 1940. 5 days later it began
its first attacks in Indo-china, 13 months prior to the attack on Pearl
Harbor. America was shocked by these acts and interpreted them as openly
hostile and tended to strengthen Chian Kai-shek's claims as the legitimate
Chinese authority. Prior to this signing Japanese forces had advanced up the
Kowloon Peninsula to glair through the wire at Hong Kong. Tokyo demanded the
British close the Burma Road and cease all war material trade with China. The
British requested the Americans invoke a general embargo as well as moving
naval forces to the western Pacific. The Americans rejected all these
suggestions. They had moved the Pacific Fleet from the West Coast to Pearl
Harbor. Because of the upcoming election it was felt that such actions would
be interpreted as support for the British colonialism which was politicaly
unacceptable to much of America. The British responded by offering to close
the Burma Road for 3 months (during the monsoon season when there was little
traffic to interrupt). Only in July of 1940, 2 months before Japan signed the
act, did Roosevelt finaly put an embargo in place which covered aviation fuel,
lubricants, and certain scrap iron and steel. In September the regulations
were tightened. Only in Nov. after being re-elected did he include copper,
zinc, brass, oil-drilling equipment, and other strategic materials.
It's important to note that as early as January 1941 the Emporer had ordered
Yamamoto to review the attack on Hawaii. Presumably because he felt
uncomfortable with the entire thing.
So the time line is something like this:
15 months prior to Pearl Harbor the US places an embargo on Japan presumably
because of their aggressive policies.
13 months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor the Japanese sign the
Tri-partite Act.
12 months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor the Emporer gets cold feet
and orders a review of the plan.
Actualy at the time, German invasion through Mexico was felt to be a real
possibility. There was significant build-up of both covert agents in Mexico
as well as military forces along the border during this time.
Note, I would appreciate any references to the regulation of Japanese
nationals transiting through or applying for residence in the US during this
period. Can't say that I've ever seen this issue in anything I've read.

Napolean never took Moscow, he was stopped - just like Hitler - at the
gates. The closest either French or German forces got was to look at the
spires of the Kremlin. Beyond that similarity there are a wide range of
differences between the situation. The fact remains that had Stalin *not*
been able to withdraw troops from the Chinese border he would not have been
able to keep Stalingrad or Moscow. Further, the *only* reason that Stalin
could afford to do that was because Sorge indicated that the Japanese were
interested in other goals at the time. Oh, regarding Napolean, the reason
that he couldn't take Moscow was because troops, called Cossacks, were moved
from the east to the west.
Hitler may have been a lot of things, stupid was not one of them.
Such as? The situation in China at the time was that a variety of warlords
were spending more time fighting each other than the Japanese. China at that
time was not a cohesive entity. The reason that Japan lost WWII was that at
no point did they have strategic supplies of oil for longer than 5-9 months
*and* the US waged unrestricted submarine warfare in the Pacific destroying
what merchant marine the Japanese had so they could not take advantage of
the oil refineries in such nifty places as Palembang, Sumatra (whose taking
in Feb. 1942 was the first use of Japanese paratroops, all 700 were wiped
out). It was not because they didn't have the men.
In 1934 Mussolini invaded Abyssinia all on his own, Hitler took the
opportunity to march into the Rhineland while the rest of the world stood
aghast at the use of modern weapons against stone-age tribesmen. The next
thing Mussolini did was send troops to help Franco, troops which fought
right along side Germans troops. On Nov. 30, 1938 Ciano made a comment in
the Fascist Chamber about 'natural aspiration' and the members stood yelling
"Corsica, Tunis, Nice!". The talk of taking Nice obviously did nothing to settle the French's worries. In July, 1938 5 billion lire was asigned to
modernize the Italian forces. The Abyssinian campaign cost 13 billion lire
and tied up 300,000 Italian troops. The help in Spain cost hardware and
involved another 50,000 troops who were still there. When the Spanish Civil
War ended in 1939 he invaded Albania, which was an Italian protectorate. By
this time Italy as allied strongly to Germany in the minds of just about
everyone. Around 12 August, 1939 after Ciano discovered the intended invasion
of Poland and passed this to Mussolini did there become a measure of doubt in
Mussolini's mind that perhaps he had picked the wrong allies.
If the US had waited until Hitler began dropping bombs on New York and
firing V2's from submarines 20 miles off the coast while at the same time
Japan was doing the same sorts of things, with a nice base at Pearl Harbor,
*and* you claim the US could have stood the test then I can only say you
are confused at best.

                   CIVIL RIGHTS WEB SITE TO FIGHT CYBERHATE
      CivilRights.org November 24, 1997
     Web posted at: 6:01 p.m. EST (2301 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to President Clinton's call to fight
     hate crime, the nation's largest civil rights coalition and a
     regional Bell telephone company have created a Web site designed to
     combat Internet hate speech.
     The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said Monday the site --
      -- was developed and will be maintained for two
     years with a $100,000 contribution from Bell Atlantic.
     Clinton issued a call two weeks ago at a White House Conference on
     Hate Crimes to find ways to fight the problem.
     "You are providing an antidote to cyberhate," he told the civil
     rights coalition in a letter read by Transportation Secretary Rodney
     Slater at a news conference on Monday.
     Wade Henderson, LCCR executive director, said the idea to create a
     Web site was triggered by a proliferation of Internet hate speech by
     groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance.
     Bell Atlantic chairman Ray Smith cited a study by the
     Anti-Defamation League showing the number of hate sites on the
     Internet has doubled to 250 in the past year. He called the new site
     "an antidote for poison."
     The idea is to "counter the frightening espousal of hatred and
     violence against Americans because of their race, gender, religious
     or sexual orientation," he said.
     Henderson said hate groups have become more sophisticated in
     communicating their doctrines and recruiting. "Instead of the
     street, they recruit on the net," he explained.
     There is also concern for the First Amendment protection of free
     speech, Henderson said. "This Web site will respond to hate with
     information and competing ideas without seeking to restrict Internet
     speech."
     In addition to providing information on hate crimes around the
     country, the site will explain various strategies to address those
     crimes and offer materials for young people, parents and teachers to
     encourage diversity.

   [INLINE] 1812: NAPOLEON IN MOSCOW
   by Paul Britten Austin
   9 x 6 in. (240 x 159 mm).  272 pages.  22 halftones, 2 maps.
   ISBN 1-85367-195-9.
   U.K. Price £19.50.  U.S. Price $40.00.
   Napoleon's Grande Arm�e waits at the gates of Moscow, preparing to
   enter in triumphal procession. But it finds a city abandoned by its
   inhabitants - save only the men who emerge to fan the flames as
   incendiary fuzes hidden throughout the empty buildings of Moscow set
   the city alight. For three days Moscow burns, while looters dodge the
   fires to plunder and pillage. And so begins 1812: Napoleon in Moscow,
   Paul Britten Austin's atmospheric 'word-film' presented through the
   testimony of more than 100 of the people who witnessed the took part
   in the campaign. A large proportion of these close-up accounts have
   never been seen in English before.
   After the fires die down the army settles in the ruins of Moscow. For
   five weeks Napoleon waits at the Kremlin, expecting 'his brother the
   Tsar' in St. Petersburg to capitulate and make peace, while in fact
   the Russian army is gathering its strength. At the same time Murat's
   cavalry, the advance guard, is encamped in dreadful conditions three
   days' march away at Winkowo, where it is being starved to death. When
   Napoleon eventually realizes the futility of his plans and prepares to
   leave Moscow, the advance guard is surprised by a Russian attack and
   tumbles head over heels out of its position. The most astounding
   exodus in modern times ensues. Trailing thousands of wagons and
   carriages laden with all the stupendous loot of Moscow, the Grande
   Arm�e moves slowly south in an attempt to outflank the Russian General
   Kutusov. At Malo-Jaroslavetz, 100 kilometers from Moscow, it runs
   headlong into ten of Kutuzov's divisions, and its 'conquest of the
   world' comes to an end with the shock of Napoleon himself narrowly
   escaping capture by Cossacks.
   1812: Napoleon in Moscow follows on from the brilliant 1812: The March
   on Moscow, which brought Napoleon's army across Europe to the great
   city. Paul Britten Austin recreates this next phase of the epic
   campaign with characteristic verve, and an astonishing sense of
   immediacy from the words of the participants themselves.
   Paul Britten Austin went to sea as a cabin boy in the British merchant
   marine, graduating to Radio Officer and serving in tankers and liberty
   ships. In 1947 he recovered his childhood home in Paris, but moved to
   Sweden, where he married the Swedish novelist Margareta Bergman,
   sister of the film director. For nearly a decade he was in charge of
   English-language broadcasts from Radio Sweden; thereafter, from 1957
   to 1969, of the Swedish government tourist office in London.
   He has written a score of books on various subjects, both in English
   and in Swedish, including a classic biography of the eighteenth
   century Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman. He has also translated many
   other Swedish classics and he has been awarded a Swedish knighthood of
   the Order of the North Star and an honorary D.Litt. In 1989 he
   contributed the article on Marshal Oudinot to David Chandler's
   anthology Napoleon's Marshals.

@_subject: Further costs of war (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
True, but my reference had to do with what would have happened if the US had
NOT gotten into the conflict. Then such shortages as the 4-engine bomber
would not have been as critical to Germanys servival as early in the war.
The bottem line, had the US not entered the war Germany and Japan had enough
resources to reach their goal. Further, it is unreasonable given the nature
of Hitler, Mussolini, & Tojo to believe they would have left the US alone,
let alone stable long-term trade.
It's unfortunate the Chinese didn't see it that way.
Actualy I am discussing the strategic and operational level, not tactical.
It isn't the result of a single battle but rather the management of a string
of battles that is important to winning. That takes understanding motives,
transportation, raw supplies, processing facilities, etc. The thesis was
that had the US not entered the war the result would have been a relatively
benign quad of the US, Germany, Italy, & Japan, supposedly moderated by
distance and economic dependancy. I challene that.
Consider the strategic interacion of 3 parties, easily extensible to more.
It is in each of the parties best long-term interest (assuming unrestricted
access to resources, theological supperiority, etc.) to pair with one of the
other parties and attack the 3rd, evenly splitting the spoils. The stablist
strategic form is binary or possibly unitary. I would further feel
historicaly supported to propose that given sufficient time, resources, and
planning this situation will develop *and* devlolve to either a binary or a
unitary form. A recent example was the Soviet Union. The interesting question
is whether the current apparent unitary position of the US will devlove into
a multi-party situation or whether it can actualy win over by some means the
other parties to willing cooperation.
And once they had control of the basic infrastructure they wouldn't have to.
I challenge the thesis that the Japanese would have had to put a soldier in
every house. Consider the situation in Vichy France and it's relationship
with German occupiers. The Chinese could certainly have no higher level of
objectionable feelings. Yet the Vichy French as a rule were quite
cooperative in supporting German goals. Even to the point of firing on their
French brothers in North Africa.
Why? The Tripartite Pact wasn't signed until Sept. 27, 1940. A considerable
time before this Churchill had been sending letters to Mussolini requesting
him to stand against Germany. That act on Mussolini's part would definitely
thrown a wrench in the Germans plan on the strategic and political level. He
chose to go with the Germans because he at some level felt they would win.
Seriously? What would the US have used? The P-51 Mustang would most
certainly not have gotten the surge it did because Britian would have been
giving their hot-rod Merlins to the Germans to put in their 109's. The
impact of that simple act alone would have seriously crippled the US and
given a considerable lead to the Germans in engine technology. Consider also
that without the military load the ME-262, Komet, Blitz Bomber, V2, etc.
would have gotten farther quicker. The US got its first jet engine from
Whipple who was a Brit.

@_subject: Global Strategic Structure - Speculative 
- n-party political systems evolve/devolve into binary or unitary
    party systems.
  - a binary system is stable provided each individual party is stable.
  - no truly global unitary system has ever existed.
  - historicaly we see multi-party systems devolve into 2-3 primary
    parties.
  - it may be possible that the US is the first country in history to
    reach the unitary model.
  - that unitary position, if it exists, is not total, there being at
    least 1 3rd world level participant. in fact there being 200+ such
    parties.
  - does the unitary position evolve/devolve back to a n-party system
    where the unitary party is either eliminated or reduced in stature.
  - is it reasonable that a single governmental system can possibly
    manage a global resource pool.
  - will we then see an averaging of political systems across the total
    set of parties.
  - is it possible, considering the range of human desires & beliefs, that
    a multiplicity at todays level of parties is a stable state, because of
    the averaging effect. In effect creating a global government rule-set
    for inter-national and intra-national behaviour. the root cause being
    that this averaging reduces the pay-off for violence and maximizes the
    pay-off for cooperating.

Revolutionary Quotes
   We built your fort. We will not have it used against us.
          John Wayne Allegheny Uprising
   Restrictions of free thought and free speech is the most dangerous of
          all subversions. It is the one un-American act that could most
          easily defeat us.
          William O. Douglas
   The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's for which the sheep
          thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces
          him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty. Plainly, the
          sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of liberty.
          Abraham Lincoln    The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution
          was in the minds and hearts of the people. This radical change
          in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the
          people was the real American Revolution.
          John Adams
   Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent
          revolution inevitable.
          John F. Kennedy
   Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of
          others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny
          ripple of hope...build(ing) a current that can sweep down the
          mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.
          Robert F. Kennedy
   Those who suppress freedom always do so in the name of law and order.
          John V. Lindsay
   Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are
          men who want rain without thunder and lightning.
          Frederick Douglass
   All civilization has from time to time become a thin crust over a
          volcano of revolution.
          Havelock Ellis
   Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's
          inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.
          Reinhold Niebuhr
   This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit
          it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,
          they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or
          their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.
          Abraham Lincoln
   The French Revolution of a hundred and fifty years ago gradually
          ushered in an age of political equality, but the times have
          changed, and that by itself is not enough today. The boundaries
          of democracy have to be widened now so as to include economic
          equality also. This is the great revolution through which we
          are all passing.
          Jawaharlal Nehru
   If our economy of freedom fails to distribute wealth as ably as it has
          created it, the road to dictatorship will be open to any man
          who can persuasively promise security to all.
          Will Durant
   Any doctrine that weakens personal responsibility for judgement and
          for action helps create the attitudes that welcome and support
          the totalitarian state.
          John Dewey
   I call that mind free which jealously guards its intellectual rights
          and powers, which calls no man master, which does not content
          itself with a passive or hereditary faith, which opens itself
          to light whencesoever it may come, which receives new truth as
          an angel from Heaven.
          William Ellery Channing
   A society of sheep must in time beget a government of wolves.
          Bertrand de Jouvenel
   All the higher, more penetrating ideals are revolutionary. They
          present themselves far less in the guise of effects of past
          experience than in that of probable causes of future
          experience.
          William James
   A regime, an established order, is rarely overthrown by a
          revolutionary movement; usually a regime collapses of its own
          weakness and corruption and then a revolutionary movement
          enters among the ruins and takes over the powers that have
          become vacant.
          Walter Lippman
   Government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit and
          security of the people, nation or community; whenever any
          government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these
          purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable,
          unalienable, indefeasible right, to reform, alter, or abolish
          it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the
          public Weal.
          George Mason
   You can never have a revolution in order to establish a democracy. You
          must have a democracy in order to have a revolution.
          G.K. Chesterton
   Here in America we a descended in blood and in spirit from
          revolutionists and rebels- men and women who dared to dissent
          from accepted doctrine. As their heirs, we may never confuse
          honest dissent with disloyal subversion.
          Dwight Eisenhower
   There is no substitute for a militant freedom.
          Calvin Coolidge
   He who would be free must strike the first blow.
          Frederick Douglass
   Those who give the first shock to a state are the first overwhelmed in
          its ruin; the fruits of public commotion are seldom enjoyed by
          him who was the first mover; he only beats the water for
          another's net.
          Michel De Montaigne
   There is a kind of revolution of so general a character that it
          changes the tastes as well as the fortunes of the world.
          La Rochefoucauld
   The art of revolutionizing and overturning states is to undermine
          established customs, by going back to their origin, in order to
          mark their want of justice.
          Blaise Pascal
   Whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the
          property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under
          arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with
          the people, who are thereupon absolved from any further
          obedience, and are left to the common refuge which God hath
          provided for all men against force and violence.
          John Locke
   Everything I see about me is sowing the seeds of a revolution that is
          inevitable, though I shall not have the pleasure of seeing it.
          The lightning is so close at hand that it will strike at the
          first chance, and then there will be a pretty uproar. The young
          are fortunate, for they will see fine things.
          Voltaire
   The most sensible and jealous people are so little attentive to
          government that there are no instances of resistance until
          repeated, multiplied oppressions have placed it beyond a doubt
          that their rulers had formed settled plans to deprive them of
          their liberties; not to oppress an individual or a few, but to
          break down the fences of a free constitution, and deprive the
          people at large of all share in the government, and all the
          checks by which it is limited.
          John Adams
   It is an observation of one of the profoundest inquirers into human
          affairs that a revolution of government is the strongest proof
          that can be given by a people of their virtue and good sense.
          John Adams
   To dare: that is the whole secret of revolutions.
          Antoine Saint-Just
   An oppressed people are authorized whenever they can to rise and break
          their fetters.
          Henry Clay
   Wherever a man comes, there comes revolution. The old is for slaves.
          Ralph Waldo Emerson
   Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution. The
          proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a
          world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!
          Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
   All men recognize the right of revolution: that is, the right to
          refuse allegiance to, or to resist, the government when its
          tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable.
          Henry David Thoreau
   Insurgents are like conquerors: they must go forward. The moment they
          are stopped they are lost.
          Wellington
   Revolutions are not made: they come. A revolution is as natural a
          growth as an oak. It comes out of the past. Its foundations are
          laid far back.
          Wendell Phillips
   Revolutions never go backwards.
          William Henry Steward
   The French revolution was a machine invented and constructed for the
          purpose of manufacturing liberty; but it had neither lever
          cogs, nor adjusting powers, and the consequences were that it
          worked so rapidly that it destroyed its own inventors, and set
          itself on fire.
          C.C. Colton
   Great revolutions, whatever may be their causes, are not lightly
          commenced, and are not concluded with precipitation.
          Benjamin Disraeli
   A reform is a correction of abuses; a revolution is a transfer of
          power.
          E.G. Bulwer-Lytton
   Whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty
          manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are
          ineffectual, the people may, and of a right ought to reform the
          old, or establish a new government; the doctrine of
          non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is
          absurd, slavish and destructive of the good and happiness of
          mankind.
          Declaration of Rights, Maryland
   There are but three ways for the populace to escape its wretched lot.
          The first two are by the routes of the wine-shop or the church;
          the third is by that of the social revolution.
          M.A. Bakunin
   Revolutions are not made by men in spectacles.
          Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.
   Revolutions are not made with rosewater.
          E.G. Bulwer-Lytton
   It is not the insurrections of ignorance that are dangerous, but the
          revolts of intelligence.
          James Russell Lowell
   The right to revolution is an inherent one. When people are oppressed
          by their government, it is a natural right they enjoy to
          relieve themselves of the oppression, if they are strong
          enough, either by withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing it and
          substituting a government more acceptable.
          U.S. Grant
   Revolutions can no longer be achieved by minorities. No matter how
          energetic and intelligent a minority may be, it is not enough,
          in modern times at least, to make a revolution. The cooperation
          of a majority, and a large majority too, is needed.
          Jean Jaures
   One of the chief symptoms of every revolution is the sharp and sudden
          increase in the number of ordinary people who take an active,
          independent and forceful interest in politics.
          Nikolai Lenin
   It is impossible to predict the time and progress of revolution. It is
          governed by its own more or less mysterious laws. But when it
          comes it moves irresistibly.
          Nikolai Lenin
   We must enter and take possession of the consciences of the children,
          of the consciences of the young, because they do belong, and
          should belong to the revolution.
          Plutarco Calles
   Those who are inclined to compromise can never make a revolution.
          Kemal Ataturk
   He that accepts protection, stipulates obedience. We have always
          protected the Americans; we may therefore subject them to
          government.
          Samuel Johnson
   If there was ever a just war since the world began, it is this in
          which America is now engaged.
          Thomas Paine
   I desired as many as could to join together in fasting and prayer,
          that God would restore the spirit of love and of a sound mind
          to the poor deluded rebels in America.
          John Wesley
   If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign troop
          was landed in my country I never would lay down my arms,-
          never! never! never!
          William Pitt
   The American Revolution was a vindication of liberties inherited and
          possessed. It was a conservative revolution.
          William E. Gladstone
   Who draws his sword against his prince must throw away the scabbard.
          James Howell
   Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
          Thomas Jefferson
   My call is the call of battle- I nourish active rebellion;/ He going
          with me must go well armed.
          Walt Whitman
   Disobedience in the eyes of any one who has read history is man's
          original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has
          been made, through disobedience and through rebellion.
          Oscar Wilde
   Disobedience, the rarest and most courageous of the virtues, is seldom
          distinguished from neglect, the laziest and commonest of the
          vices.
          George Bernard Shaw
   Tyranny brings ignorance and brutality with it. It degrades men from
          their just rank into the class of brutes; it damps their
          spirits; it suppresses art; it extinguishes every spark of
          noble ardor and generosity in the breasts of those who are
          enslaved by it; it makes naturally strong and great minds
          feeble and little, and triumphs over the ruins of virtue and
          humanity.
          Jonathan Mayhew
   No government power can be abused long. Mankind will not bear it.
          Samuel Johnson
   Some boast of being friends to government; I am a friend to righteous
          government, to a government founded upon the principles of
          reason and justice; but I glory in publicly avowing my eternal
          enmity to tyranny.
          John Hancock
   The evils of tyranny are rarely seen but by him who resists it.
          John Hay
   It is lawful and hath been held so through all ages for any one who
          have the power to call to account a tyrant or wicked king, and
          after due conviction to depose and put him to death.
          John Milton
   If a sovereign oppresses his people to a degree they will rise and cut
          off his head. There is a remedy in human nature against tyranny
          that will keep us safe under every form of government.
          Samuel Johnson
   'Twixt kings and tyrants there's this difference known;/ Kings seek
          their subjects' good: tyrants their own.
          Robert Herrick
   The mob is easily led and may be moved by the smallest force, so that
          its agitations have a wonderful resemblance to those of the
          sea.
          Polybius
   The common people suffer when the powerful disagree.
          Phaedrus
   Do not wonder if the common people speak more truly than those above
          them: they speak more safely.
          Francis Bacon
   Do not be too severe upon the errors of the people, but reclaim them
          by enlightening them.
          Thomas Jefferson
   The people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our
          liberty.
          Thomas Jefferson
   I am not among those who fear the people. They, and not the rich, are
          our dependence for continued freedom.
          Thomas Jefferson
   The welfare of the people is the supreme law.
          Motto of Missouri
   In your dread of dictators you established a state of society in which
          every ward boss is a dictator, every private employer a
          dictator, every financier a dictator, all with the livelihood
          of the workers at his mercy, and no public responsibility.
          George Bernard Shaw
   It is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep
          the rest in order.
          Thomas Jefferson
   Arbitrary rule has its basis, not in the strength of the state or the
          chief, but in the moral weakness of the individual, who submits
          almost without resistance to the domineering power.
          Friedrich Hatzel
   Despotism has forever had a powerful hold upon the world. Autocratic
          government, not self-government, has been the prevailing state
          of mankind. The record of past history is the record, not of
          the success of republics, but of their failure.
          Calvin Coolidge
   It violates right order whenever capital so employs the working or
          wage-earning classes as to divert business and economic
          activity entirely to its own arbitrary will and advantage,
          without any regard to the human dignity of the workers, the
          social character of economic life, social justice, and the
          common good.
          Pope Pius XI
   The foundation on which (our government is) built is the natural
          equality of man, the denial of every pre-eminence but that
          annexed to legal office, and particularly the denial of a
          pre-eminence by birth.
          Thomas Jefferson
   When the government violates the people's rights, insurrection is, for
          the people and for each portion of the people, the most sacred
          of rights and the most indispensable of duties.
          Marquis De Lafayette
   Revolution is the larva of civilization.
          Victor Hugo
   General rebellions and revolts of a whole people never were encouraged
          now or at any time. They are always provoked.
          Edmuns Burke
   It is only by instigation of the wrongs of men that what we call the
          rights of men become turbulent and dangerous.
          James Russell Lowell
   Revolutions are like the most noxious dungheaps, which bring into life
          the noblest vegetables.
          Napoleon
   When all other rights are taken away, the right of rebellion is made
          perfect.
          Thomas Paine
   Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the
          Third may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the
          most of it.
          Patrick Henry
   None but tyrants have any business to be afraid.
          Hardouin de Perefixe
   He who strikes terror into others is himself in continual fear.
          Claudian
   Tyrants have not yet discovered any chains that can fetter the mind.
          Colton
   There is something about men more capable of shaking despotic power
          than lightening, whirlwind, or earthquake, that is, the
          threatened indignation of the whole civilized world.
          Daniel Webster
   Anarchy is the sure consequence of tyranny; for no power that is not
          limited by laws can ever be protected by them.
          John Milton
   One sharp, stern struggle, and the slaves of centuries are free.
          George Massey
   The bigger a state becomes the more liberty diminishes.
          Jean Jacques Rousseau
   Every generation must wage a new war for freedom against new forces
          which seek through new devices to enslave mankind.
          Progressive Party Platform
   The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.
          Edmund Burke
   Tyrants are always assassinated too late. That is their great excuse.
          E.M. Cioran
   There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to
          conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the
          lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
          Machiavelli

Revolutionary War Quotations
   By Kristen Ballard
   Contents:
   Introduction | Before the War | During the War | Conclusion |
   Bibliography
   Introduction:
   Many famous quotes came from the Revolutionary War. Quotes were said
   by people to express and tell other people their feelings. Many quotes
   effected people during battles, and some quotes led to the beginning
   of some battles.
     _________________________________________________________________
   Before The War:
   "If this be treason, make the most of it!"
   This quote was said by Patrick Henry at the time of the Stamp Act in
   1964. His purpose for saying this was to defend himself. This quote
   helped from a patriot group called the Stamp Act Congress.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "If our Trade be taxed, why not our Lands, or Produce� in short,
   everything we possess? They tax us without having legal
   representation."
   This quote was said by Samuel Adams after the Stamp Act of 1765. His
   purpose for saying this was to make people go against the idea of
   having the trade taxed. The effect it had was it made other Americans
   think about what had happened and many became discontent.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and
   New Englanders are no more. I AM NOT A VIRGINIAN, BUT AN AMERICAN!"
   This quote was said by Patrick Henry in 1774 right after the Boston
   Tea Party had taken place. His purpose for saying this was to keep
   self-interest from destroying the common effort of some Americans. The
   effect it had was that it made American colonists work together and it
   angered the British.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "� the very tails of American sheep are so are so laden with wool that
   each sheep has little wagon to support its tail and to keep it from
   trailing on the ground."
   This quote was written by Benjamin Franklin after "Braddock�s Defeat"
   in the London Chronicle. His purpose for saying this was to mock the
   English. It made the English mad and brought up several arguments
   about governing the colonies in America.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "� I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me
   liberty or give me death!"
   This quote was said by Patrick Henry at a meeting of the First
   Continental Congress in 1774. His purpose for saying this was to make
   the Americans fight for liberty and independence. The effect it had
   was it played an important part on the making of the Declaration of
   Independence.
     _________________________________________________________________
   During the War:
   "Don�t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it
   begin here."
   This quote was said by Captain John Parker after Paul Revere�s ride in
   April of 1775 in the town of Lexington. His purpose for saying this
   was that he didn�t want to start the war, but if the British did, they
   would fight. This began the Revolutionary War when one shot went off
   because all of the British men started firing furiously.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "..Should the colonies send an army of two or three thousand man and
   attack Montreal, we should have little to fear from the Canadians or
   Indians, and would easily make a conquest of that place� "
   This quote was written by Ethan Allen in 1775 after the war had begun.
   His purpose for saying this was because he wanted to fight the British
   and to tell his army that they shouldn�t be afraid of the Indians or
   the Canadians because they could defeat them. This made it impossible
   for restoration of harmony.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "I move that these united colonies ought to be free and independent�"
   This quote was said by Richard Henry Lee in 1776 at the writing of the
   Deceleration of Independence. His purpose for saying this was to tell
   how the American colonists felt about freedom and independence.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "�On our side, the war should be defensive� we are now in a
   [dangerous] position. Declining an engagement to flight may throw
   discouragement over the minds of many, but when the fate of America
   may be at Stake, we should continue the war as long as possible�"
   This quote was written by George Washington in 1776. His purpose for
   saying this was to tell the Congress that the only way that the small
   Continental Army could win was to fight defensively, and to attack
   only when victory was certain.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish."
   This quote was said be John Adams in 1776 just before the writing of
   the Declaration of Independence. The reason he said this was because
   he was standing up for the idea of the colonies being independent.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "These are the times that try men�s souls�"
   This quote was written by Thomas Paine after the writing of the
   Declaration of Independence in a forty-seven page pamphlet called
   Common Sense. His purpose for saying this was to try to persuade the
   Americans to demand independence, rather then try to patch up their
   differences with Great Britain. The effect it had was it made George
   Washington start to prepare his army.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country."
   This famous quote was said by Nathan Hale at the retreat of the
   British from New York in August of 1776. His purpose for saying this
   was these were his last words before he was hanged. This quote showed
   the spirit of the fighting Americans.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "May it please Your Honor, I surrounded them!"
   This quote was said by Sam Clowney at the Battle of Camden. He said
   this because he was fooling five Tories into believing that he had a
   whole army with him. The effect it had was Clowney took them prisoner
   and he impressed Colonel Thomas.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "Where a goat can go, a man can go; and where a man can go, he can
   drag a gun."
   This quote was said by Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne at the Battle at
   Mount Defiance. He said this to encourage his troops to drag their
   cannons and weapons up Sugarloaf Mountain (Mount Defiance). The effect
   it had was General St. Clair ordered the patriots to abandon the fort
   because they knew that they were at the mercy of the men on Sugarloaf
   Mountain.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "�Let us die here rather than retreat."
   This quote was said by Alexander Hamilton at the Battle of Monmouth.
   He said this to convince General Lee not to retreat. The effect it had
   was it gave General Lee hope. It also caused the British to retreat
   and sneak away to New York.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "Tie up overcoats, pick touch-holes, fresh prime, and be ready to
   FIGHT!"
   This quote was said by Ben Cleveland at the Battle of Kings Mountain.
   He said this as the Americans were going out to fight the British. He
   said this to prepare his men for the battle. The effect it had was it
   made the Americans aware of how badly Cleveland wanted to win this
   battle. The Americans surrounded the British and took six hundred
   prisoners.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "�I know the cause it desperate; but Sir, we must either quit the
   country or attack."
   This quote was said by George Rogers Clark at the Battle of Vincennes
   in February of 1779. His reason for saying this was to convince
   Patrick Henry that Clark and his men must attack the Hair Buyer and
   his men or give up completely. The effect it had was the Indians fled
   because they believed Clark had about a thousand men at the bottom of
   a hill.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "I have not yet begun to fight!"
   This quote was said by John Paul Jones at the battle between the
   Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis in September of 179. His purpose for
   saying this was to show that he was not going to give up. The effect
   it had was the battle continued for two more hours and soon after
   that, the Serapis toppled into the water, forcing Pearson to
   surrender.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "I request you will witness to the world that I die like a brave man."
   This quote was said by John Andr� at the attack from West Point in
   August of 1780. He said this because he was hanged when he was
   pronounced a spy and even though he didn�t do the crime he didn�t
   fight to get free. It had a big effect on certain people. Sir Henry
   Clinton locked himself in his room for three days, and the English
   newspapers raged over the hanging. They called it murder.
     _________________________________________________________________
   "We began a contest for liberty ill provided with the means for the
   war, relying on our patriotism to supply the deficiency. We expected
   to encounter many wants and distressed� we must bear the present evils
   and fortitude�"
   This quote was said by George Washington at the battle of West Point
   in 1781. He wrote this because he was telling the army and the people
   on the home front not to give up or lose heart in the battle.
     _________________________________________________________________
   Conclusion:
   Many quotations had important effects on most of the people in the
   Revolutionary War. They made some people very mad, some happy, some
   confused, and they even made some people proud. Quotes had a lot of
   thought put into them. Some people have to this awhile before they can
   understand them.

Actualy it does, it's just that the reason for this discussion has escaped
your blipvert mentality. The reason this is relevant was the claim made by
others that had the US *not* entered WWII then the situation would be
significantly different than now. In particular it would be a more positive
results. I draw exception to this and am willing to debate the point.
It's interesting that as a direct results of this conference the Japanese
took the time to put down their plans to secure (ie take over) the western
Pacific. It relied on their typical "Great All-out Battle" strategy. An
important point in this strategy was luring the US fleet into Japanese
waters and defeating it.
Actualy most of these islands were originaly Dutch, German, or Spanish.
For example, the Philipines were Spanish.
[data deleted]
Vulis, this hasn't dawned on you yet but none the less, you are actualy
agreeing with my position that it isn't possible for the US to have kept
out of the war. The other participants simply didn't have the resources or
the system to organize them with otherwise.
Which books Vulis, books you have access to or books that you wrote? I made
a request for more specificity. Which books in particular are you refering
to? Further, for this to be relevant you must show that it was a change of
state that mitigated the Japanese actions in some way. That last proviso is
the bear...

WARNING: blipvert mentality
It was still Russia. The claims of incompetence and internal unrest apply to
both regimes. Is there some point you wish to review regarding this point?
Actualy, the Russians never beat the Japanese prior to Khalkal Gol.
[deleted material, relevance unclear]
This was the battle of Chankufeng Hill (1938). My sources indicate the
casualties were approx. 10,000 on each side.
But(!), the relevant point of this conflict is one simple point. The
Russians didn't re-inforce *or* launch their counter-attack until *after*
Sorge had assured the Russians that the Japanese would *not* re-inforce
themselves (which they didn't). Further, it is important to note that Zhukov
employed a massively superior force, including weapons, the likes of which
had never been employeed by the Russians before. In addition, Zhukov is
notable not for his strategic sense but his tenacity, he didn't care about
casualties and did not withdraw once forces were committed. Even though it
was clear that the Japanese would have withdrawn because of lack of
reinforcements. It was a show battle from the military perspective.
[deleted material, relevance unclear]
Only after he was shure that the Japanese wouldn't contest it.
Militarily speaking Moscow didn't fall. :-) There was no battle. The course
taken by the Tzars in dealing with Moscow was a political move that would
actualy provide them with more return than an actual battle. Remember,
Moscow was the fort (ala Kremli), the capital was St. Petersburg. This
strategy was discussed and discarded by Stalin as being politicaly
Actualy they did walk in. Napolean spent six weeks at the Kremli before
realizing the folly of his misunderstanding. He was waiting on the Tzarist
forces fro St. Petersburg. By that time 3/4 of Moscow had been burned to the
The Cossacks didn't arrive until shortly *after* the French began moving
their van out of Moscow.
But it's irrelevant to this discussion.
Irrelevant to this discussion as well.

And just exactly what does that have to do with contributing to the US
becoming involved in WWII?
The point to this is that at the same time the US was taking the Hawaii's, Guam,
and conquered the Philippines (costing 20,000 Filipinos & 4,000 Americans).
The US itself was making grabs into that same pie.
Actualy it stems from my being an American and the names that are chosen for
whatever reason. Pretty weak ad hominim.
[deleted material - weapons count - relevancy unclear]
Huh? Who said anything about Zhukov being innovative? His main claim to fame
is his disregard for casualties.
The issue in both cases wasn't military. In Napoleon's case the capital
wasn't Moscow, it was St. Petersburg. Moscow was an outpost the French over
estimated the worth of. By not fighting for it the peoples sacrifice created
a great political environment and also further depleted the French who
weren't prepared for the weather. In the WWII case, Stalin couldn't afford to
be seen backing down.
The Germans only got to the outskirts. And the records that I have indicate
that it wasn't a cake walk. To quote a report that Bock made to Brauchitsch
just after arriving from viewing Moscow from a front-line bunker: "I have last night relieved a divisional commander who reported that the Russians
had repulsed his men with hammers and shovels."
There was no assumption. Stalin had Sorge to tell him what was up.
Assuming he had no intelligence, send out scouts. I would probably look at
some form of contested withdrawal (the hardest kind of operation technicaly)
to a set of stop-lines. I would use those stop lines for re-supply &
re-organization. This would allow me to remove troops from the front lines
and compensate with improved logistics over my opponent, whose supply lines
only get longer and longer. I would in addition increase my intelligence
resources (eg traffic monitoring & analysis) on that front. I would furher
increase my air forces ability to bomb in close support to about 100 miles
behind the front lines. The lines would be about 30-60 miles apart depending
on terrain. Never under-estimate your enemy (that 'no intelligence' will
bite you in the ass *every* time) and have a clear goal. I would attempt to
pull some troops from the eastern front because the Japanese supply lines
would be long and external, while mine get shorter and are internal. This
would allow me an edge on the typical 3:1 ratio. I would further recognize
that while I had lots of natural resources in that area but few urban areas
physical control for a short period while resolving the western front is
acceptable. If something like the US entering were to occur I would then put
a light covering screen and pull troops out because the Japanese don't have
the resources to fight on that many fronts.
No, I claim that *one* of the issues involved was to be able to appear at
the bargaining table as Hitlers equal. Material refering to these motives are
in Ciano's diary. Mussolini was wanting the entire episode to be seen as a
grand adventure. He wanted Italy to be seen as an adventersome country with
the cutting edge in political systems successfuly fulfilling its rightful
place in history. In short, he wanted to be seen as the 'good guy'.

We are talking commercial remailers here right? . As famous as you are, you don't get to change the rules in the
middle of the game.
You don't need anonymous remailers for this since simple crypto will provide
just as good private communications security than anonymous remailers will
because there is no central choke point where traffic analysis occurs . Now
if one of the parties is actualy under surveillance then the anonymous
remailers won't help because they will be tapping at the source, if anything
it would provide further evidence of the parties complicity in a conspiracy.
If you want your communications to stay private (if I understand your use of
the word) use encryption and use underground remailers which isn't open to
commercial exploitation, or else simply purchase a different account on your
current ISP.
Irrelevant, people don't pay for test posts enough to keep a commercial
remailer in business - unless we vastly increase the total traffic level by
quite a few orders of magnitude. irrelevant, people won't pay for this either.
irrelevant (and I'm a Pantheist, they don't get more obscure than that)
since people ain't gonna pay for this unless they are persecuted in their
country of residence. If so the easiest thing to do would be to outlaw
anonymous remailers (with the same logic they use to oppress the religion).
[see  for more details on this]
And you suspect they will actualy pay for this? This line of reasoning I
would love to hear more on...
Let's look at this a moment. I believe we can take as a given that Singapore
is a oppressive regime. Furthermore all traffic in Singapore goes through
government operated and regulated POP's. In that environment you really want
to send traffic to an anonymous remailer? Can you say 'man-in-the-middle',
and not only that but all the outgoing traffic from Singapore won't be
through an anonymous remailers making it trivial for Singapore officials to
determine exactly who to go hassle. So it is clear that the only parties
discussing Singapore safely will be outside Singapore which makes the
supposition that Singapore is going to come after you a bit suspect.
You're talking about a country that outlaws private satellite dishes - get
real. Furthermore commercial enterprises are open to much closer scrutiny in
areas like Singapore making it even harder to stay in business unless the
operator happens to be a government stooly, hardly the stuff of security.
My thesis would be that any remailer (commercial or not) in a country with
an oppresive regime is the last place you want to consider secure.
See  Applies to China, Korea, Iraq, etc.
I would also like to see your explanation of exactly why they would pay for
The only reason that anonymous remailers are useful here is that the
originating party doesn't want to deal with the results of being known.
The flip side to this is that the reputation of anonymous discussions in
these sorts of areas would have little political impact. A person who won't
discuss such issues under their own name certainly won't go out and become
actively involved in some political movement. Now if your claim is that such
activity might hold some weight with an elected official I would appreciate
an explanation as well - especialy considering that the anonymity provides
just enough 'cover' so that the politician can safely ignore any and all
traffic made through this mechanism, "They aren't one of my constituents."
If you have some reasoning outside this please share it.
Irrelevant because people won't pay for this.
Free remailers are useful for all sorts of mental masturbation, for actual
business there doesn't seem to be a lot of uses.

Actualy I have never killed anything with my current .22, but a lot of tin
cans and paper targets have been holed. And, no, I would NEVER consider a
.22 anything close to a self-defence weapon since even a head shot doesn't
guarantee anything other than pissing the target off. I might use it as a
club but it is not nearly that stout, I'd go for my shovel or hoe or maybe
my nunchakus (assuming they didn't have a gun -which most burglars and such
don't have).
Actualy it cuts down on crime because the criminal is afraid they might get
shot. A perfect example of this is Florida or Texas where the vast majority
of people have guns. If you catch a burglar in your house or car do they
run? No. Why? In the vast majority of cases the perp states that they were
afraid of being shot - in effect saving both lives. I can say this, I would
never consider staying in a place for very long that prevented me from
owning a gun legaly. Well, actualy there is one way, guarantee that I get my
own personal police officer to go around with me (and they should be armed).
Here in Texas we have a law that permits the owner of property to kill
without warning any party stealing their property after dark. It's amazing
that the vast majority of burglaries and such happen during the day.
It's further interesting that in both Texas and Florida after legalizing
handguns the number of robberies and such went down, as well as the number
of violent crimes using guns. The only thing that went up was domestic
violence where one spouse killed another in a fit of rage. Had the gun not
been there they would have gone back to knives and frying pans which used to
be the weapon of choice. Are you proposing that we outlaw knives and frying
pans as well?
Not mentality, maturity. I am shure they think about it all the time, they
just can't find an underground gun dealer.
Yeah, they not only blow up the individual target but a couple of dozen other
bystanders in the process. If it's so damn safe how come the cops over there
all carry machine pistols and such. Something you never see here in the
states even during a bank robbery.
First, not that many little kids are killed by guns. Most die many other
ways much more horrible. Two presidents and if Illinois is any show the
Grandma's can take care of themselves. Secondly, in this country more people
are killed each year by hands, feet, and clubs than guns. Thirdly, the vast
majority of gun owners would no more shoot somebody without thinking than
they would run over them in their car. Beside, it takes a moment of
reflection to get the sites lined up. You have accepted your over-bearing invasive jackbooted police with a
equinimaty that would never occur here - we'd shoot the SOB's. Sounds like
when it comes to sheeple the US has a long way to go when compared to Europe.
And if some of those aren't shot we'd have a lot of people running around
with other peoples property against their will. Shooting a person is in and
of itself not bad, if you believe it is then I take it you support disarming
the police and military as well.
Do you support capital punishment?
Apparently it's you and your ilk that haven't gotten the clue:
It isn't that a gun was used but under what circumstances.

Most households in the US do have firearms, most criminals don't steal guns
they buy them from the underground. If they do steal them they sell them
pretty quickly afterward. Very few gun crimes in the US are committed with
stolen guns, or guns stolen by the possessor at the time of the shooting.
Bullshit, they have muggings and such there just like everywhere else. Are
you seriously claiming that sort of stuff doesn't happen? The schools here
in Austin don't either. Most schools in the US don't have this sort of
stuff. The way to fight crime is to stop putting 1st time offenders, drug offenses,
non-violent crimes, etc. in jails AND to make consensual crimes non-crimes
like they ethicaly should be. We have over a million people in jail in the
US, more than any other country, the vast majority of whom shouldn't be in
jail because what they did shouldn't be a crime.

Why is the situation more stable if both parties are armed? If I were
confronted by a armed burglar and we were facing off I would pull the
trigger as soon as I got a lock. If their gun wasn't in a ready position I
would warn them and if they so much as flinched I'd drop them. If they were
unarmed I might beat them senseless with the gun but I would not shoot them
unless they made a motion to rush me, then I would go for a non-lethal shot
unless the distance was less than a dozen feet (rushing distance) or so in
which case I prefer head shots followed by center-torso (heart) shots. I'd
also train to fire 3 shot groups. The one exception would be center-torso
shots if they were wearing heavy or bulky clothing that might hide a vest.
In that situation (assuming it wasn't a rush) I would shoot for the inside
of the thigh at the hip-joint. Hit that artery and your dead without
immediate medical attention (which I am not likely to give after just
shooting the SOB). If it was a rush situation I would dump the clip into
their chest moving upward, hoping the KE would slow them down enough to get
a clear head shot (this would be what I practiced the most as well).
No, despite your claim the most stable situation is to not have the invasion
in the first place, followed by the victim being the only one armed. Anything
else is a gun-battle waiting for a twitch.

This holds if it is a one-time occurance. If Mallet is looking at the
traffic over a very long time it is completely reasonable to expect some
correlation to become clear.
To address the example another presented about some book example of burst
analysis. Look at real-world examples such as the underground in France in
WWII. They would generate a single message on a known frequency at a
specific time. Thus interested parties could dial-in and get the info but
would not provide the Nazi's with sufficient traffic or time to get a
bearing. The revolutionaries in the book are amateurs and deserve what they
get since it is clear they are incompentent and by extension not fit to run
a country. Anyone with a clue will use times single instance transmissions
and if available burst or SS transmitters to reduce the transmission time
even more.
With current technology like full-time satellite surveillance and
transmitter characteristic analysis anything more than a single burst
transmission with the radio from a random location will provide sufficient
traffic to get a fix. You should also throw the transmitter away or change
the drivers in the finals after each use as characteristic analysis will
provide Mallet with the means to track the transmitter and thereby apply
traffic analysis (just like they use in some cell systems).

             DOOR-TO-DOOR SCHOOL SALES DEBATED AFTER BOY'S SLAYING
     Werner October 1, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:02 p.m. EDT (0202 GMT)
     TOMS RIVER, New Jersey (CNN) -- During the school year, it's a scene
     that takes place across the United States -- children selling
     merchandise door-to-door, raising money to benefit their schools or
     activity groups.
     But now, the rape and murder of an 11-year-old New Jersey boy who
     tragically knocked on the wrong door has brought renewed attention
     to the issue of whether door-to-door sales should be discouraged, or
     even outlawed.
     Prosecutors say Edward Werner was attacked and murdered by a
     15-year-old boy who opened the door at a house in Toms River. Edward
     hoped to win a walkie talkie by selling the most merchandise in a
     contest.
     Authorities say they know of no other connection between the victim
     and the teen who has been charged -- that it was a "chance
     encounter" brought about by Edward's door-to-door selling in what a
     prosecutor describes as a "very safe" neighborhood.
     The teen-ager was charged Wednesday with murder and aggravated
     sexual assault. Authorities did not release his name because he is a
     juvenile.
  Raising money for the PTA
     Schools and non-profit groups pull down an estimated $2 billion a
     year from product sales, and no state has a law restricting
     door-to-door fund-raising sales by school children. But in the wake
     of Edward's slaying, a New Jersey legislator has suggested a ban.
     Neighborhood
     Ironically, Edward was raising money for the PTA -- though the
     national Parent Teacher Association has a policy discouraging
     students from selling merchandise door-to-door. The sales kits
     provided to the students warned them to sell only to "family,
     friends and neighbors with whom you are familiar."
     The Association of Fund Raisers and Direct Sellers, a trade group
     representing about half of the estimated 1,500 companies that deal
     with school and youth groups, has also adopted a policy saying it
     does not endorse door-to-door sales.
     Instead, the association suggests that children sell to relatives,
     friends or neighbors they know, while having parents sell to their
     co-workers, according to Russell Lemieux, the association's
     executive director.
     "That's really the bulk of sales in fund raising," Lemieux said.
     "The instance of a child going door-to-door is quite rare."
     However, children are often offered incentives that encourage them
     to sell as much as they can -- incentives which could have a
     tendency to encourage, rather than discourage, door-to-door sales.
     "Our members say incentives ... make a big difference," Lemieux
     said.
  Robbery thought the motive
     When he was last seen, Edward had about $200 on him, and police say
     he had been showing that money to friends. Robbery is believed to
     have been a motive in his murder, but no robbery charge has been
     filed.
     In the wake of the tragedy Edward's school district has banned
     door-to-door sales, as green ribbons have begun to appear in his
     memory.      Correspondent Christine Negroni contributed to this report.

               TEEN KILLS 2 AT SCHOOL; MOTHER FOUND DEAD AT HOME
     Woodham October 1, 1997
     Web posted at: 3:38 p.m. EDT (1938 GMT)
     PEARL, Mississippi (CNN) -- A Mississippi teen-ager slashed his
     mother's throat Wednesday morning before going on a shooting rampage
     at his high school that left two students dead and at least six
     wounded, authorities said.
     The high school junior, Luke Woodham, was arrested and charged with
     three counts of murder shortly after the shooting at Pearl High
     School, about three miles east of the state capital, Jackson.
     Police Chief Bill Slade choked back tears as he told reporters,
     "This was a disgruntled girlfriend-boyfriend thing... We talked to
     the youth. He gave us a statement and his manifesto was that he felt
     he had been wronged."

     A former girlfriend of the suspect was one of two students killed at
     the school.
     Slade also said police suspect that the student had killed his
     mother, Mary T. Woodham, 50, at home earlier Wednesday by slashing
     her throat.
     The shooting happened about 8:10 a.m. as buses were arriving at the
     school. David Williams, a sophomore, said the gunman walked into the
     commons area inside the front of the school, pulled a rifle from his
     jacket and opened fire.
     "He was shooting anybody he could find. He shot at me and hit the
     staircase," said Mark Wilkerson, a freshman. "I saw fragments going
     everywhere." Medic offering help
     One student described the accused youth as reserved. "He was a very
     quiet person," said Alan Burrow.
     Four wounded students, ranging in age from 14 to 18, were taken to
     Rankin Medical Center in Brandon, Mississippi, where one student had
     already been treated and released. Grieving students gathered in
     hospital waiting rooms.
     "The injuries are non-critical gunshot wounds," hospital spokesman
     Mark Lee said. "In layman's terms they are flesh wounds."
     Officials shut down the school almost immediately after the shooting
     and sent all students home.
     Rhonda Marks, a spokeswoman at River Oaks Hospital, said two
     students had been brought into the hospital for treatment. Marks did
     not know if the hospital would receive any more wounded.

@_subject: Remailers and ecash (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
Mallet will be following the cover traffic, since it is cover there will be
no correllation uncovered between input and output traffic because the
output traffic header info will either be a small class of destinations used
over and over or else it will be chosen randomly using something like a
spider on webpages or a usenet newsgroup crawler. Just send the bogus
packets to random addresses, talk about spam with a bite...
For the sender to chain from remailer to remailer to destination the
destination has to be in the header info somewhere. Now in the most secure
system each packet header will only contain the address of the next hop. When
the next site gets it the packet contents are de-crypted (otherwise reading
the chaining info is trivial) and the contents are uncovered to reveal another
packet with the next hop header and another encrypted block. And on and on
we go.
Now if I were tasked with traffic analysis of this sort I would look at each
incoming header and each outgoing header. I would look for some sort of
correlation (ie some percentage of the time when I see this source address I
see this destination address within some period) over time between the steps
in the chain. Realisticaly it would take at least a dozen or so
transmissions using the same remailer chain before a clear pattern would
emerge. In general there are two types of classes in traffic analysis. The
first is monitoring of a specific entity involved in the transfer, usualy
source or destination. The second is passive traffic monitoring where I
simply go from remailer to remailer and find statistical correlation between
the various packets in the hope that somewhere somewhen I would come across
something of use.
The first type is the most commen currently but with the various requests by
the FBI and other LEA's it is becoming clear they want to get into the
second class of traffic analysis in a big way. Guess they are finding it
harder and harder to get the big-wigs like the drug cartels because they use
a higher degree of technology than the LEA's do, they're simply out-classed.
With the second class they could catch a email (for example) from some end
user buying a couple of quarters of pot and then chase that chain in
reverse. Without the passive second class monitoring they would have never
gotten that lead in the first place.
Now consider the LEA's think nothing of monitoring a suspect for years if
required. I know of one case where the DEA spent 2 years tracking a
'kingpin' for 45 tons of herb. They even brought in specialist from the NSA
and military to do covert monitoring for the over-seas participants,
including traffic analysis of their communications.
If they ain't LEA's then a whole new set of options become available. Also
consider, if they aren't LEA's then they are probably doing a class one
traffic analysis which is only a matter of time to resolve.
Considering the current number of anonymous remailers it would not surprise
me if the CIA/NSA/Massad/MI5/etc. are not currently monitoring them all. It
is a given that countries like Iraq, Singapore, China, etc. are currently
doing about all they can to monitor the remailers because they are known to
be used by 'terrorist' organizations.
It seems to me that many people have an inherent (and unrecognized)
assumption that Mallet will have access only to a single remailer and won't
bother actualy tracing the traffic. A bad assumption.
It is also worth remembering, the government as a whole is quite slow but
there are some quite capable individuals.

Shure they do because one of the things I would love to do is run a
commercial anon remailer. If I as a businessman motivated to get into it can't
justify it how in the world can somebody with less technical experience
justify it? How would you justify it to your bank for a $10k loan? I suspect
that if I can find a way to overcome my anal retentive penny pinching then
it will sell others as well.
You obviously have never done business with me. I've turned more than
one customer away because they were either stupid or wanted something that
was completely out of line. I provide my customers a specific set of
services at specific fees with specific results, period. If they don't like
the way their baby looks that is their problem, I just deliver 'em. I do
this out of love, not a need to feed.
Depends on their motivation...a question we all seem to be grappling with.
If it's possible I am shure that one of the thousands of posts that we
generate on this issue will be the trigger.

Remember: A gun is like a finger, just point it at what you want to
          hit.
I have met hundreds of great shots in my life, there are many people for
whom this sort of behaviour would not be delusional. My grandfather (who
you'll hear more about in a minute) used to delight us as small kids by
lighting matches stuck in wood fence posts with a .22 pistol from about
50 yds. My cousin from Louisiana likes to shoot squirrels (if you can call
it that) by passing the bullet just in front of their nose, causes lung
hemorraghes and they just fall off the limb. Me, I always miss or blow their
teeny little head off, it's apparently a game of 1/4 inches. I work with an
ex-gomer (ie USMC) pilot who is quite phenomenal with his .357 Desert Eagle,
his groupings are just about an inch at 25 yds.
I have 20/10 eyesight (in one eye now, the L. is blind) and I've been
shooting guns since I was 6 years old. By the time I was 12 I was killing
Nutria in Louisiana's swamps every summer for bounty with a single shot of
.22 from 100+ yds. I once got a nice heart shot on a deer at 400 yds. over
iron sites with a .308. I hit what I aim at with a pistol or rifle assuming
I have fired it a few times (which if I own the gun is a given). The first
thing I do is range a weapon when I buy it. It's also why I practice shooting
in groups of 3. Better chance of hitting, and hitting something important.
Being shot at doesn't bother me, been there done that several times now, so
I don't think that will be much of a factor.
I agree a snap shot is inaccurate but if I have time to get the gun and get
to my bedroom door nobody is going to get a chance for a snap shot. Hell, if
I had a reasonable idea where they were I'd shoot their wormy ass through
the wall. I seriously doubt anyone can get to my bedroom without me being
warned (my burglar alarm isn't electronic).
If you break into my house at 1AM this is a given. I'll either shoot you or
beat you to death with a skillet. If you don't want to die don't break into
my house. It's the Golden Rule. There is absolute NOTHING that justifies
breaking into my house at any time let alone in the middle of the night. It's
called 'cause and effect' unfortunately most folks now a-days just don't seem
to have caught the clue.
There is a saying that my grandfather tought me (he was a medic in WWI
because he was a contientous (sp?) objecter):
If you pull a gun on somebody shoot, and shoot to kill. If you can't bring
yourself to kill then don't use a gun.
Who the hell wants to non-lethaly wound a burglar, I'm betting on them
flinching when I start yelling at them...
Absolutely great reasons to shoot the asshole there.
Look, when a person breaks into your house, robs you, rapes you, or whatever
they are basicly saying "I am going it on my own, I apply no rules or
recognition of civilization. Your life means nothing to me because I am willing to trade it for a few measly bucks". It is silly to try to deal with
such people reasonably, if they were reasonable they wouldn't be there in the
first place (they'd be home protecting their own possessions). They are
a clear and present danger with long-term intent. Save your life and their
next victim or your tax dollars to put them in jail and train them to be
better criminals, do everyone a favor kill them now.

                BOY SHOOTS SISTER FOR TALKING ON PHONE TOO LONG
     October 1, 1997
     Web posted at: 11:11 p.m. EDT (0311 GMT)
     ORANGE PARK, Florida (AP) -- A 14-year-old boy shot his sister for
     talking on the telephone too long, a law enforcement official said.
     The boy, who was not identified because of his age, was charged with
     attempted murder. His 15-year-old sister was treated for a gunshot
     wound to her chest and released from a hospital.
     The boy said that his sister was getting on his nerves for talking
     on the phone too long, the sheriff's office said.
     He said he took his mother's .22-caliber revolver from a locked box
     in her bedroom. The girl was reading a book when she was shot
     Monday. When officers arrived, the boy was talking on the phone.
     "I could understand a temper thing, but this kid had the gun for
     four or five hours before he went into his sister's bedroom and shot
     at her twice," said sheriff's Sgt. Wes Gronikowski.

                   NATIONWIDE CRACKDOWN ON MAIL FRAUD BEGINS
     Mail fraud graphic October 1, 1997
     Web posted at: 11:11 p.m. EDT (0311 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal, state and local law enforcement
     agencies joined hands with more than 1,500 private sector volunteers
     Wednesday to launch a nationwide crackdown on mail fraud.
     "Project Mailbox," initiated by the Federal Trade Commission, U.S.
     Postal Inspection Service, the National Association of Attorneys
     General and the American Association of Retired People, targets con
     artists who use mass mail to defraud consumers.
     The FBI estimated several years ago that an estimated $40 billion a
     year is lost to mail and telemarketing scams that include a range of
     deceptive claims such as phony bills, bogus advance-fee card offers
     and false contest claims.
     One goal of the new effort is to get a more accurate and up-to-date
     estimate on the size and nature of this problem. To assist, AARP is
     asking members to turn over unsolicited and suspicious mail to law
     enforcement officials. The coalition is also launching a consumer
     education campaign.

I have been shot at several times, some were hunting accidents and some were
intentional. I did not freek out nor did my adrenalin rush impede my ability
to think or to react. I did shoot back in each case. I am still alive and
don't have a single bullet hole in my body so I must be doing something
right. Don't know about them, I left the area in every case ASAP.
My house at 1am is not comparable to the jungle nor is the psychological
situation comparable either. I am not confused about where or what is going
on nor am I worried about making my tour. I am faced with the clear situation
of somebody who wants to do me bodily harm. That doesn't scare me, it pisses
me off to no end. When I get a rush I don't shake and such, I get very calm
and methodical. It's only after the crisis has passed that I tend to sit down
and shake like hell.
No shit. Let me make this clear. The ONLY way I would even consider shooting
to wound was if the burglar was CLEARLY UNARMED, and the only reason that
would happen was because in Texas shooting unarmed persons, even burglars,
is illegal other than that you'd be dead. In any other situation my intent is
to kill, kill, kill. As I said before, I would start with a center chest body
shot and work up (which is natural since the aim point for successive shots
will rise).
We agree on this point.

must garner some of the responsibility of putting them in that situation.
In short the methods we use to control drug use in this country promote
crime. This does not apply to others who would do this anyway and happen to
take drugs, which means the drug laws are clearly unreasonable.
Isn't killing dogs a bad thing? I am shure my dog thinks so. Perhaps their
is a lesson to be had in comparative psychology here. It's much easier to
ask another entity to die for you because you consider them different and
therefore of less value in the grand scheme of things. Human history is full
of such instances. This also happens to be the rationale a lot if not all
burglars use to justify their actions as well.

Shure you can. The operator offers a simple service, resend email
anonymously. If the result of that email is the anon user bringing hardship
on the remailer cancel their account. If they do it again, cancel it again.
Such is the woes of a commercial remailer. Outside of that, if they don't
like the fact that I won't do other things for them when they are anonymous
that is too bad.
Like I said, I offer specific services with specific goals for a specific
fee. If the results are not what you wanted, too bad. You want my other
services then you'll have to give up the anonymity because I need a certain
level of security that dealing with anonymous customers simply can't provide.
I would operate a commercial remailer, I would limit my services to keeping
the remailer up and the accounts valid so long as the money flowed in from
the users, period. I don't do dedicated lines, security audits, development,
etc. to anonymous customers.

@_subject: Remailers and ecash (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
No they don't, all remailers do not encrypt their outgoing as a matter of
course (do any currently do it as a matter of course? I would bet not if I
were a gambler). The remailer you used to send this didn't use encryption on
its outgoing or else I wouldn't be able to read it. The last time I looked
about a year ago the vast majority of remailers didn't encrypt their outgoing
traffic as a matter of course, it required the user to do it (I suspect this
is still true). Furthermore I specificaly used the word 'set' to mean a group
of remailers acting in concert such that this encryption happened
automaticaly - I know the answer already - No, there are no sets (ie a
cooperative network) of remailers (Mixmaster operaters included) implimenting
this unless the user goes to extreme and does it all themselves. As a matter
of fact there appears to be little to no cooperation between remailer
operators. There are no remailer key servers to manage the server and user
keys so the user must contact each remailer and obtain the key which is
itself open to traffic analysis, note that such first contacts by definition
have to be in the clear. Hope that Mallet starts their analysis AFTER you
get your keys or else. If this process can't occur automagicaly there is
little commercial utility for the system - it's too cumbersome.
First off, the size of the packets in no way effects the succes of a traffic
analysis, only a cryptanalysis of their contents. Traffic analysis looks at
four things: the incoming packet header, the outgoing packet header, and
the times of receipt and transmission.
The idea behind latency is that if it is chosen correctly and the packet
re-transmission falls outside the analysis window there is no way to
correlate the incoming and outgoing traffic. From the analysis engines
perspective the events are distinct and non-related. Simply re-ordering the
packets at re-transmission time does nothing if I set the window larger than
the time it takes to resend the original traffic and the cover traffic.
Setting the analysis window to infinity also causes the analysis overhead to
grow quickly though this means that re-ordering and latency are irrelevant.
A party implimenting traffic analysis is probably not going to look at the
contents until they have a clear understanding of the traffic flow between
the surveiled parties. At that point it is cheaper to look at the involved
parties and see if one of them has a weakness that can be exploited (ie
offer immunity to a herion addict) over doing actual expensive
cryptanalysis. If you can subvert a member you are in the classic
man-in-the-middle position.
When the Austin Cpunks looked at Mixmaster about 1.5 years ago for several
months it became clear that as implimented currently Mixmaster can't easily
support public remailer key servers or automated non-user-involved chaining
and processing (encryption & decryption). Shure the packets look the same,
but unless you as the sender go in and manage that material you are shit out
of luck. The remailers can't do it themselves without user intervention,
that's economicly not viable.
It is actualy quite simple why you would want to do this. You could then in
effect send the same packet (identical in every bit) to a set of remailers.
Each remailer would then decode the packet and send it on. All but one would
go to bogus addresses and the one remailer with the right key would get to
resend to the next remailer(s). Plus none of the outgoing traffic would be
to the same server, further complicating analysis. This also gives the user
some control over how much cover traffic gets generated. However Mallet
doesn't know which packets are which and therefore must follow every packet.
This multiplies the number of hops in the traffic analysis that need to be
analyzed. As mentioned in one of my previous posts, in this situation the
complexity goes up by a power causing the required computing resources to
trace the traffic to quickly become excessive.
Sine this is so painful for you, I assume this is the end of this

It will certaily tell you if the system is network aware, as to internal
operation and its validity it says nothing. If you want to test it you must
send each remailer in the network a message with a final destination of the
source. If you don't get it back you know the remailer is not online. This
is called a 'loopback'.
So as long as I only send traffic to other remailers the electricity and
such are not charged? How does my local electric company measure this?
If the remailer is turned on there is a cost. Unless you are getting charged
by the packet the cost of operating is indipenant of the traffic until you
have to increase your clogged pipe. Commercialy irrelevant approach.
But it doesn't pay for the cover traffic. It also short changes the
man-in-the-middle remailers since they have to spend resources without
getting recompensed. This would indicate that there is little financial
motive to operate a remailer that deals only with other remailers.
So what keeps me from submitting message after message and never pulling
them out? I guess you just keep paying the bills to pay for the increasing
traffic and the need to increase your pipe to carry it. Commercialy
irrelevant. Also, consider the exponential expansion from cover traffic.
So what if I use a free-net or perhaps one of the free machines at the
public library or at the local college? Or the system at work?

Of course not:
 -   it provides even more non-covered traffic for Mallet to analyze
 -   it proves that the remailer is keeping long-term records of its
     activity, further prompting Mallet to use rubber-hose crypto or
     a covert break-in to recover the data.
A commercial remailers should keep no records and this means that each
submission must include some form of token for immediate payment of access
fees. Further, a secure remailer should NEVER send traffic to a subscriber
as the result of anything other than normal traffic handling.

Forwarded message:
Why/how does it decide to throw them away? Does the incoming produce cover
traffic even if its thrown away? Traffic analysis generaly does not look at
the contents of the packets, encrypted or not is irrelevant.
I suspect it would lower the estimated ratio of cover traffic if nothing
gets sent out. This would in general lower the cost to analyse the traffic.
I would set it up to send bogus outgoing even if the message was dropped.
That way the analysis would correlate the dropped message to the outgoing
and produce a cover ratio closer to the actual value. Also remember to send
n+1 bogus traffic to make up for the dropped outgoing.
By 'nym' you mean each subscribed address or to each address used in the
outgoing? I would say it is bad to send to subscribers. It provides
non-covered traffic that identifies your subscribers specificaly (really not
a threat since Mallet already has their original incoming and therefore
their source address) as well as demonstrating that you are keeping long-term
traffic records. The long-term records represent a clear threat to the
security and stability of the remailer. If you send out this cover traffic
regularly then be shure to use some mechanism to select email addresses
randomly or else Mallet will get a list of your bogus addresses and begins
to filter them immediately.
A commercial remailer should not keep records of its use. However, I suspect
that eventualy remailers will be required to keep usage records by law.

                      JUDGE THROWS OUT RUBY RIDGE CHARGES
     Randy Weaver's house October 2, 1997

     * Judge invokes double-jeopardy law
     * Harris accused of killing U.S. marshal
     * Charges against FBI agent unaffected
     BONNERS FERRY, Idaho (CNN) -- An Idaho judge dismissed a state
     murder charge against a man accused of killing a federal agent in
     the Ruby Ridge shootout, saying he can't be tried again after his
     acquittal of murder in federal court.
     Idaho Magistrate Judge Quentin Harden ruled Thursday that the charge
     against Kevin Harris violate a state law barring prosecution of
     someone who faced the same charges in another "state, territory or
     country."
     Prosecutor Denise Woodbury, who charged Harris and FBI marksman Lon
     Horiuchi in state court in August, had argued that the state
     double-jeopardy law was meant to cover prosecutions in other
     countries, not the United States.
     "I find that (Idaho law) bars further prosecution of Kevin Harris
     for the acts set forth ... in the complaint in this case," Harden
     said.
     "To rule that the courts of the United States of America do not come
     under 'another state, territory, or country' would be an anomalous
     result -- giving more credence to the courts of another country than
     to the courts of our own nation," Harden wrote.
  Harris accused of killing U.S. marshal
     Standoff scene
     Harris, 29, of Republic, Washington, was accused in the shooting
     death of deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan and of shooting at
     another agent in the August 21, 1992, shootout that precipitated an
     11-day siege at the cabin of white separatist Randy Weaver.
     A friend of Weaver's, Harris was staying at the cabin during the
     shootout and was wounded by an FBI sniper's bullet. Weaver's
     14-year-old son, Sam, was killed in the gunfight. His wife, Vicki
     Weaver, was later shot and killed during the siege by the FBI's
     Horiuchi.
     The shootout has become a rallying point for some groups who believe
     federal law enforcement has encroached too much on citizens' rights.
     Weaver and Harris were tried and acquitted of federal charges in
     1993.
     But in August, Woodbury charged Harris with first-degree murder in
     Degan's death and assault with a deadly weapon against Arthur
     Roderick, another law enforcement officer. Harden also dismissed the
     assault charge.
     Woodbury also charged Horiuchi with involuntary manslaughter in the
     death of Vicki Weaver.
  Charges against FBI agent unaffected
     Harden's ruling doesn't affect the charge against Horiuchi, who has
     never been tried in any court. His lawyers have indicated they will
     try to move his case to a federal court.
     Harris was at his job as a welder when he received the news that the
     murder charge against him had been dismissed, said Diane Peters, his
     business partner at Eagle Industries.
     "We were hoping what was fair and just would turn out," Peters said.
     Harris himself did not return a phone call, and Woodbury declined to
     comment on Harden's ruling.

Forwarded message:
Perhaps this should be added.
Way too high for commercial use. Get it down to something like .01 and that
would be workable I suspect (haven't done the math). Course this raises the
issue of who pays for dumped mail on a commercial box. Should the customer
pay since it was their action that instigated the drop? Or perhaps the
remailer since they were selling a service which they didn't provide at
their discretion?
Not to me. It's your box and your money, set any policy that you desire.
If I as a user don't like it, I'll beat feet...
Let's generalize a bit to see if we can get a clearer picture.
 -   traffic that seems to be duplicate.
     What if the digital signature on each one is valid implying the
     originator intended to send the 3,000 pieces. Do you dump them
     and take the money?
 -   traffic from specific parties whose reputation capital is low.
     As a business should this really matter as long as the creetin
     pays the bill?
 -   traffic of an abnormal format
     Don't see any issues with this one.
Are there any other classes that you can think of that you might want to
filter on?
Ok, so you are doing header filtering.
Let's see if we can put some numbers to it...
We receive n pieces of mail. n/10 is tossed at reception based on header
filtering. For each mail that gets to the remailer code we sent m cover
messages and 1 real message.
So the remailer handles a total of (n - n/10) + (m + 1)(n-n/10)  pieces in a
given time period, t. Let z stand for (n - n/10) the actual number of
processible traffic, we can reduce this to z + (m + 1) z.
Let's assume now that we go ahead and transmit cover for those emails we get
something like z + (m + 1) z + m ( n/10 ). We don't add a 1 to the m(n/10)
because we don't have a real outgoing to process.
So the total traffic load of the remailer can be represented by:
 L = z + (m + 1) z + m ( n/10 )
 L = (n - n/10) + (m + 1)(n - n/10) + m(n/10)
Now if you look at a travelling salesman problem you see quickly that the
complexity grows quite quickly. This produces a traffic analysis load of
something of the form,
 T = L ^ v
Where v represents the complexity factor in dealing with the possible
combinations possible.
So, without actualy plugging numbers in there, I would say it looks like a
small increase in output could grow pretty quickly because of the power
growth factor in the extra traffic and processing it.
Ok, let's add a 'software failure' category.
If I understand you the remailer would send outbound traffic to its input
for distribution to your subscribers? I don't believe it would factor into
the analysis at all if all the source destinations are the same. Outbound
traffic from party A that went to party B would be important to track. So,
if you wanted to do this sort of stuff and you wanted Mallet to chase their
tail I would randomly pick source addresses from my subscriber base and send
the bogus messages to my subscribers making shure nobody received an email
from themselves. Then it looks like everyone is involved in a conspiracy...
It has nothing to do with limiting speech so I doubt you'd have a 1st leg to
stand on. Furthermore, the 1st doesn't guarantee the right to anonymity. If
you want to claim that as a fundamental right you'd need to use the 9th and
10th. It does have to do with being able to trace the perp back if
needed. I am not saying I agree with it, just recognize that reasonable
people will see this lack of tracability via a court order as a clear threat
to their security at all levels.

Duh. Look you picked the numbers and the scenarios, if you got a bitch about
'em talk to yourself...their your ugly baby.
So how do we rollback the payments if say the nth hop breaks the delivery?
If I were a user and one of the remailers dropped the traffic I would want
all my money back, I'm paying for delivery to a specific party.
It is clear that the n-1 remailers has no claim to the charges since the
email was not delivered to the recipient. Yet, it is not fair to take their
income simply because some other remailer dropped mail due to a policy
problem, which they clearly didn't have since they delivered the traffic to the
next hop successfuly. Perhaps the remailer with the restrictive hop should
pay the n-1 remailers. This would certainly provide clear financial
incentive for remailers to have liberal fair use policies (which I support
fully) and act as true commen-carries simply doing a job mechanicaly like
the phone system or the network infrastructure itself. The bottem line is
that if commercial anonymous remailers will survive they have to be as
liberal with handling traffic as my routed is.
Is it? If this were commercial systems the key server would NOT be on any
remailers involved otherwise we have a prime target for man-in-the-middle
attacks. So, assuming the user gets the key and the remailers get the keys
from a 3rd party server which delivers the incorrect keys for whatever
reason. Who pays for the failure then? To me it looks like the key server,
but they aren't involved in traffic control but key control. While it is
clearly fair to charge them for costs (say 1 remailer hop) incurred due to
bad keys (which could be the original submitters fault), who pays the other
remailers who handle the traffic and loose the income through no fault of
their own?
Also, what happens if the key is good but the software glitches (which is
indistinguishable from a bad key at the source level)? Are you proposing
we re-send for free all along the chain? I don't think the remailers which
succeded will take kindly to that.
If the MTBF for a remailer is n then the MTBF for m remailers is n*m. In
other words the remailer chain gets less reliable as it gets longer.
Let me say it again, traffic analysis doesn't look at the contents,
cryptanalysis does. Whether the contents are encrypted or not is irrelevant.
The word 'encrypted' NEVER occurs in traffic analysis. You encrypt the
contents because it is assumed that the network analysis has already
Ok, so the recipient has no way to reply to specific parties unless the
contents contain the source address in a source encrypted block. In such a
case Mallet is going to look at the recipient and begin traffic analysis on
them. Which Mallet is going to do as soon as they either submit or recieve
traffic from that node anyway. Seems moot. An effective Mallet collects
statistics on all participants indiscrimenantly.
This is another example of the apparently unrecognized and implicit
assumption that Mallet is only going to look at one party in the chain.
Bad assumption. Traffic analysis will succeed ONLY if the *network* is
analyzed, not some specific node in that network.
This sounds like a message pool where a recipient must attempt decode on
every packet they recieve. The ones not meant for them fail. I don't believe
this is a commercialy viable process because of the amount of work on the
recipients machine.
I have a further question. The cover traffic that shows up in the recipients
mailbox unrequested is spam isn't it? Also, when the recipient uncovers the
last block is it going to say "This space intentionaly left blank"? Or can
users of your remailer expect to recieve email full of hex gibberish they
can't decode since they don't have a key? My suspicion is that if you are
sending cover traffic to anything other than a /dev/null recipient
with an a priori agreement you are not going to keep your users long.
Turn those numbers around and you might manage to cover the traffic.
The cover traffic MUST be greater than the 'real' traffic to be effective.
My suspicion based on about 4 months of playing with MixMaster 1.5 years ago
is that this ratio must be several orders of magnitude unless your traffic
is measured in the millions+ of transactions per day.
All the outgoing traffic better look the 'same' it's nothing but a standard
TCP/IP routing header and the contents (which we never look at). The
remailer software is irrelevant on this issue. Traffic analysis relies on
the stability of the protocols and their source & destination info not what
they are used for.
As for the rest of it, take the equation I gave in a previous email and feed
it into a spreadsheet. Develop the equations that define the network using
the same sort of structures and proceedures you use for a travelling
salesman problem (check a local library). If you're asking me to do that
work then I need money, I'll talk about work for free - I don't do work
for free.
The remailer only needs records of transactions while a transaction remains
un-committed. The only long term record it should keep is the number of
transactions processed and how much money is currently on the books.
The records are not available unless somebody cracks the box and begins to
tool around the OS ... Mallet is pretty sneaky he reads CERT and collects
hacker software too. If your remailer is keeping records of transactions
after the transactions close you are not secure. You are actualy providing
further incentive to Mallet.
Just exactly where is anonymity mentioned in the 1st? And since it clearly
is not how do you extend:
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Is your claim that the remailer is a press? (I rhetoricaly bet not) If so
then every computer irrespective of use is a press and protected. Are you
going to follow this line in future cases?
Or is your argument that the traffic is speech and therefore the carrier of
the traffic is immune to prosecution? If so you may have some problems in
the future when the judges and prosecutors get a better clue. Because the
1st's speech clause protects the source of speech not the carrier - that's why
the founding fathers specificaly mention freedom of the press - to extend
that protection to the carrier. Or did you use the commen-carrier approach?
My money is that you used the second line of reasoning which means you can
expect it to be over-turned in the coming years. Unless somebody manages to
get a court to recognize computers as presses and extend those protections
fully or networked computers (not the applications they are put to) in
general as commen-carrier the battle isn't over.
Now if you throw the 9th and 10th in there (which I further rhetoricaly bet
you didn't) you got a winning combo.
Rhetorical question: do you realize that all networked computers are
                     remailers at the routed level? Did you extend your
                     argument thusly?

           REPORT: PARENTS SOUGHT TREATMENT FOR TEEN SLAYING SUSPECT
     The suspect's house October 3, 1997
     Web posted at: 4:18 a.m. EDT (0818 GMT)
     JACKSON TOWNSHIP, New Jersey (AP) -- Three days before 11-year-old
     Eddie Werner vanished while selling candy door-to-door, the parents
     of the teen accused of killing him reportedly asked a judge to lock
     up their son.
     The parents of the teen asked a Family Court judge on September 24
     to place him in a residential psychiatric treatment center in a bid
     to get his violent behavior under control, The Star-Ledger of Newark
     reported Friday.
     Instead, he was allowed to remain at home. Werner
     Last Saturday, Werner disappeared as he sold candy and wrapping
     paper for a school fund-raiser. His body was discovered Monday night
     in a wooded area between the neighborhoods where he and the suspect
     lived.
     Authorities have not released the name of the suspect because he is
     under 18.
     On Thursday, prosecutors said they believe the suspect was molested
     by a 43-year-old New York man who met him through an online chat
     room and arranged trysts.
     Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said Stephen Simmons, 43, of
     Holbrook, New York, and the suspect met at New Jersey motels and at
     Simmons' home for sex several times over the past 13 months. Simmons
     The boy's parents learned of the meetings and informed police.
     Simmons, who has been charged with third-degree sodomy and could
     face other charges, was arrested on September 24 -- the same day the
     suspect's parents made their request of the judge.
     "These people had been crying out for help a week before the
     incident," the suspect's attorney, Michael Critchley, told The
     Star-Ledger. "Everybody should step back and pause a moment before
     they put this kid on a pyre and burn him."
     The teen-age suspect faces murder, aggravated sexual assault and
     robbery charges. Prosecutors were reviewing whether to have him
     tried as an adult. memorial
     Acquaintances described the suspect as a loner and a bully, but
     others said he was an average teen and a good student with an
     interest in computers. He built his own Web page, which he filled
     with biographical tidbits and exhaustive information about his
     favorite rock band, Smashing Pumpkins.
     He also explored other regions of the online world. Kaye said
     information found on a computer drive seized by prosecutors
     indicated the boy was visiting homosexual chat rooms, where he first
     met Simmons.

   InfoWorld
   04-OCT-97
   Buying stamps for use on "snail mail" soon may be possible over the
   Internet, and one company pioneering the technology to do so has
   caught the attention of both Microsoft and AT&T.
   E-Stamp has created a system that will enable users to purchase
   postage over the Internet and then print viable U.S. Postal Service
   stamps onto envelopes.
   Recently, both Microsoft and AT&T Ventures announced that they have
   taken an equity stake in E-Stamp. Both companies will receive a 10
   percent stake in the postage sales system's creator, and both will
   hold a seat on its board of directors. Financial details of the
   investment were not disclosed.
   "One of the things we're trying to do now is build the industry
   infrastructure by forming strategic partnerships with software,
   hardware, and Internet companies, and we see our relationship with
   Microsoft and AT&T as the first step in this process," said Nicole
   Ward, vice president of marketing for E-Stamp.
   The potential for both Microsoft and AT&T to incorporate E-Stamp
   technology into their product lines in the future could be intriguing,
   according to analysts.
   "Microsoft could certainly be incorporating the generating technology
   into Office," according to Vernon Keenan, senior analyst for Zona
   Research, in Redwood City, Calif. "I could see clicking a button in
   Word, and when you print out your envelope, you'd get a stamp on it."
   "It's certainly conceivable; that's not a scenario that we've
   ignored," said Greg Stanger, director of business development and
   investments for Microsoft, in Redmond, Wash. "The Office team picking
   it up and incorporating it into whatever they're doing is not out of
   the question."
   E-Stamp is preparing to beta test the system in San Francisco and
   Washington by the end of the year. Once postage is purchased from the
   U.S. Postal Service over the Internet, the value of the "stamps" will
   be held in an "electronic vault" attached to a PC and printer,
   according to the company.
   The Postal Service will monitor the amounts as it currently does with
   postage machines, but Internet postage is a new innovation, according
   to Roy Gordon, program manager of process and product development for
   meter technology management for the U.S. Postal Service, based in
   Washington.
   "This is the first new form of postage potentially introduced by the
   postal service in 77 years," Gordon said.
   E-Stamp estimates that the complete system will cost less than $300
   per year.
   The irony of using the Internet to facilitate the delivery of "snail
   mail" was not lost on analysts.
   "It is definitely ironic," said Ray Boggs, director of small-business
   research for IDC/Link, a market research company in New York. "But
   what could be more appropriate than leveraging one technology to
   benefit another?"

Remember n is a fraction, failures/time_period ...
If your MTBF is 1 failure per year for each system and you have 10 systems
your MTBF is 10 failures per year. Looks like multiplication to me....
Course you can look at it another way as well. Which would mean you would
have 1 failure every 10th of a year. That's division, and also misleading
because failures don't care about the time period, they may happen all
at once.
Depends on how you look at MTBF, I generaly look at it the first way because
I can use addition if I'm working on a system that don't have multiplication
(eg machine code on a 68HC11) that way I don't have to build some damn
floating poing library to do division ...
Statistics, damn statistics, and lies.

Just a quick head-up....
The ISDN is going up and down today, there are several SWBT trucks in the
neighborhood. My suspicion is that they are working on the trunk line throw
from the N. Lamar station to the one on Duval behind the church. If this is
the problem then it should go stable (or go dead because of another
documentation error like last time) sometime this afternoon.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

@_subject: MTBF 
MTBF is usualy given as a single number, number_of_base_time_units from
initial turn-on to 1st failure given no power downs or other interruptions.
This is effectively of the form number_of_base_time_units/failure.
This is clearly equivalent to number_of_failures/base_time_unit for
practical use. Especialy considering that in this form you generaly don't
ever need to do a division as you do if you use the first form.

TURNING ONIONS INTO DIAMONDS.  Nano-diamonds can
be created without high pressure by squeezing carbon "onions"
(nested buckyball-like structures) with ion beams.  Graphite
material can be made into diamond the hard way, with the use of
high pressure (above 10^6 atmospheres), high temperature, and
the use of catalysts.  But recently scientists have been able to
bombard carbon onions with electron beams and now ion beams
as well, and have been able to convert the onions almost
completely into diamonds, up to 100 nm in size.  Researchers at
the Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart (Florian Banhart,

SUPERFLUID if placed on the right surface, say physicists at the
University of Illinois (David Ceperley, ceperley at ncsa.uiuc.edu). Superfluids, substances that flow without friction, are few in
number: liquid helium-4, special gases of rubidium and sodium
atoms (in the form of Bose-Einstein condensates), pairs of
helium-3 atoms, and pairs of electrons (which flow through
superconductors).  The trouble with getting hydrogen molecules
(H2) to become superfluid is that they are all too ready to
combine with each other into H2 solids. By laying them on a
silver substrate and by salting them with a pinch of alkali metal
atoms, the H2's should be able to resist the tendency to solidify
all the way down to zero temperature.  At 1.2 K they would
become a superfluid, the Illinois theorists predict.  They believe
this can be carried out over the next year, after which
experimentalists could explore unique hybrid superfluids, such as
H2/He-4 mixtures.  (M.C. Gordillo and D.M. Ceperley,

A POLYMER THAT CAN TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN
DIFFERENT LIGHT BEAMS has been demonstrated by
researchers at UC-San Diego (W.E. Moerner, 619-822-0453),
opening possibilities for inexpensive and easily manufacturable
"optical transistors" that can amplify or attenuate a light beam. The San Diego polymer is an example of a "photorefractive"
material, a material that adjusts its structure and electronic
properties when two or more light beams combine on it to form
an interference pattern.  On these materials, light from one beam
can bend in such a way as to bounce back in the direction of a
second beam, adding energy to it.   Inorganic versions of these
materials exist, but they are difficult to make and can cost
thousands of dollars for a tiny cube. Moerner constructed a
polymer whose three main components carried out essential tasks:
buckyballs offer electrons, poly (n-vinyl carbazole) (PVK)
molecules carry these electrons along their backbone, and
PDCST molecules stretch or contract, changing the way light
bends in these regions.  The researchers demonstrated a "net
gain" of about 5, in which one of the laser beams shining on the
material gained energy.  These materials have numerous possible
applications, including correcting distorted images.  (Science, 25

   Subject: Clinton to propose IRS citizens panel on Friday
   After weeks of Republican criticism that he was defending the Internal
   Revenue Service, sources tell CNN that President Bill Clinton on
   Friday will propose creating national and regional citizens boards to
   handle taxpayer complaints against the agency.
   Clinton's citizens panels would not have as much authority over the
   IRS as most Republicans prefer. But the White House believes the
   proposal will give the president cover.
   Under the Clinton plan, a national citizens panel would be created to
   serve as a forum for oversight and to handle taxpayer complaints.
   Similar panels would be created to serve as complaint clearinghouses
   for each of the IRS' three dozen regional offices.
   An administration official tells CNN that Clinton will also commit to
   internal IRS reforms designed to make the agency more efficient.
   The administration move comes after sharp complaints from
   congressional Democrats and White House political advisers who worried
   that the administration appeared to be defending the agency during
   Republican-called hearings that highlighted taxpayer complaints.

   Commission urges U.S. to take 'hands
   off' approach on regulations
   October 8, 1997: 3:17 p.m. ET
   [LINK]    [INLINE]    Encryption fight rolls on - Sept. 15, 1997

   BRUSSELS (Reuter) - European officials urged governments, including
   the United States, on Wednesday to take a "hands off" approach to
   regulating the technology needed to ensure that Internet transactions
   are confidential.
   [INLINE] "If regulation at all is needed, it should be very light," a
   top telecommunications commission official said, presenting a report
   on how the European Union should promote security on the Internet.
   [INLINE] EU Telecommunications Commissioner Martin Bangemann told
   reporters that strict controls would end up penalizing law-abiding
   users rather than the criminals they targeted.
   [INLINE] He added that the United States, which restricts exports of
   certain strong encryption products, was becoming isolated on the
   issue. "We must engage in a debate with the Americans at an
   international level," he told a news conference.
   [INLINE] The commission's report addressed the use of encryption and
   "digital signatures" -- electronic seals that are attached to
   transmissions to allow recipients to verify their origin and ensure
   that they have not been tampered with.
   [INLINE] It urged the EU to take a common approach to the questions,
   saying otherwise cross-border Internet trade could be hampered. It
   said it would propose legislation on "digital signatures" in the first
   half of 1998.
   [INLINE] Encryption has become a contentious issue because some
   governments and law enforcement authorities want to regulate it as a
   way to keep it out of the hands of terrorists and other criminals.
   France has virtually outlawed use of encryption software.
   [INLINE] But the commission said controls could impede the growth of a
   technology that is essential to promoting business over the Internet
   and would likely not work anyway.
   [INLINE] "It's not possible to prevent criminals from using modern
   technologies in order to protect themselves and their messages from
   the police," Bangemann said. "There's not much point in preventing
   legal users from having access to this."
   [INLINE] In addition to its export controls, the United States is
   discussing legislation that would restrict encryption technology
   domestically, for example by requiring systems that would allow law
   enforcement authorities to tap into electronic transmissions.
   [INLINE] Bangemann renewed his push for a global charter on the
   Internet that would address questions such as encryption, noting that
   the United States had already expressed interest in the idea.
   [INLINE] The Commission said EU legislation on digital signatures
   would address questions such as legal recognition of signatures,
   liability, technical requirements and certification authorities (CAs).
   [INLINE] CAs hold information that allow recipients to confirm the
   identity of the person that has sent a transmission.
   [INLINE] It said it would look askance at national restrictions on
   encryption, however. "Instead of introducing or maintaining rather
   inefficient but cumbersome restrictions, the Commission invites member
   states to enhance cooperation of police forces on a European and
   international level," it said. Link to top    home | digitaljam | contents | search | stock quotes | help

                       U.S. SEEN AS OPEN TO CYBER ATTACK
     Cyber Warfare graphic October 8, 1997
     Web posted at: 3:46 p.m. EDT (1946 GMT)
     BALTIMORE (AP) -- Suddenly, electric power goes off. Or telephones
     go dead. There's chaos in the electronic banking system. Are the
     incidents electronic accidents, or deliberate attacks?
     Computer security experts from government and private industry
     voiced agreement Tuesday that as the most technologically advanced
     society in the world, the United States is uniquely vulnerable to
     electronic attack.
     How soon the threat would be real and what could be done to block it
     were principal topics of discussion on the opening day of the
     National Information Systems Security Conference.
     "Our profound vulnerability is growing on a daily basis," said
     Charles Abzug of the Institute for Computer and Information
     Sciences. "Since our society is the most technologically advanced in
     the world, we are more vulnerable than anyone else."
     Robert Marsh, a retired Air Force general who is chairman of the
     President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, told
     the conference that "while a catastrophic cyber attack has not
     occurred, we have enough isolated incidents to know that the
     potential for disaster is real and the time to act is now."
     The commission is expected to send its report to the White House
     next week. Marsh said the panel would recommend far greater
     cooperation and sharing of information between government and
     private industry, accelerated research and a nationwide program to
     educate people on the scope of the problem.
     But questions were quickly raised as to how much information the
     government could share from a report that is classified.
     "We have to solve this dilemma because if we don't, we have no
     sharing of information," said Thomas J. Falvey, a commission member
     who is a security expert at the Transportation Department.
     Marsh conceded in an interview that there will be a need to break
     down reluctance within industry and government to share sensitive
     information.
     He said there is a need to "devise the means by which the private
     sector can in fact be willing to share its information and not fear
     that it will leak."
     At the same time, the government "is going to have to recognize that
     in this new era, it's the private sector that needs some of this
     threat information and this warning information."
     As examples of cyber attacks already experienced, Marsh cited
     incidents at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and Griffis Air
     Force Base in Rome, New York.
     "A flood of e-mail messages originating in Australia and Estonia,
     and routed through the White House computer system, virtually shut
     down Langley air base's e-mail for hours," he said.
     Someone in England routing messages through Latvia, Colombia and
     Chile and commercial Internet service providers gained access to
     computers at Rome Laboratory at Griffis and "launched attacks
     against a wide array of defense and government computer systems,"
     Marsh said.
     One of the difficulties in such cases is determining whether it is
     the work of a mischievous hacker or an attack by a hostile
     government.
     "If Iran attacked AT&T, how does AT&T know that's an act of war
     rather than some kid fooling around?" asked John Pescatore, a senior
     consultant at Trusted Information Systems, a developer of computer
     security software.

There in no 'DATA' construct in 6502 assembly.
This is some sort of macro that either the assembler or programmer

in 6502 good programmers use the branch instructions (BCC, BCS, BEO, BMI,
BNE, BPL, BVC, BVS) because the JSR required three bytes versus 2 bytes for
a Bxx. The only constraint was that the branch target must reside in the same
256 byte page as the branch itself. The biggest boo-boo committed here was not
realizing that branch offsets that took you across the upper page boundary
would leave you at the lower page boundary plus some remaining offset.
Idealy a jump table was created that had the various target addresses for your
routines. Then a Bxx followed by a indirect mode JMP (NOT a JSR). If that table
was in the first 256 bytes it was possible to save a whole clock cycle AND a

                  BROTHER'S BOOK: ATF BLEW UP MURRAH BUILDING
     James Nichols
  Jury selection continues in Denver courtroom
     October 8, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:21 p.m. EDT (0221 GMT)
     DECKER, Michigan (CNN) -- As jury selection continues in the trial
     of accused Oklahoma bombing conspirator Terry Nichols, his brother
     has published a book meant to plant the seeds of doubt about whether
     Nichols was involved in the worst terrorist attack ever on U.S.
     soil.
     The 415-page book, co-written with Bob Papovich, is called
     "Freedom's End: Conspiracy in Oklahoma." In it, James Nichols
     contends that his brother had nothing to do with the 1995 bombing,
     that a law enforcement agency actually blew up the building, and
     that the FBI has not investigated the case sufficiently.
       _______________________________________________________________
  "They have failed to prove anything. They have investigated people, but not
  the bombing, because all they want to do is prosecute people, not find out
  the truth."
    ï¿½ James Nichols
       _______________________________________________________________
     Specifically, James Nichols contends that the plastic barrels found
     at his brother's Kansas home did not match those found in the rubble
     of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He also
     contends that the bomb did not contain ammonium nitrate, as
     prosecutors contend. vxtreme CNN's Ed Garsten reports.      James Nichols does admit that Timothy McVeigh, already convicted and
     sentenced to death in the attack that killed 168 people, was upset
     about a 1993 raid by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
     at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. But he scoffs at the
     idea that was the motive for the Oklahoma bombing, as prosecutors
     say.
     "Getting back at the (ATF) is a really stupid argument. There were
     few (ATF) agents stationed at the Murrah building," he writes.
     Freedom's End
     Instead, James Nichols maintains that the ATF itself blew up the
     Murrah building as part of a cover up of what happened at Waco.
     He wrote, "Who benefits by destroying records that would prove that
     the (ATF) was lying about the alleged drug laboratory, illegal
     weapons and child abuse at (the Davidian compound)?"
     Contacted for a response, an ATF spokesman told CNN that the agency
     could not comment because of the ongoing trial of Terry Nichols in
     Denver.
     James Nichols is scheduled to testify in his brother's defense.
     For James Nichols, writing the book may have been easier than
     getting it published. He says mainstream publishers would not print
     it, so he and Papovich published it themselves and took out loans to
     pay for it. Nichols also says many books stores are refusing to
     carry it because of its controversial subject matter.
  Jury selection continues in Denver
     In Denver meanwhile, a second week of jury selection began in
     Nichols' trial in U.S. District Court. Terry Nichols
     A grandmother who said it would be a mortal sin for her to impose
     the death penalty, and who pleaded that she needed to be with a sick
     daughter, was dismissed Wednesday on grounds of hardship.
     "I could never think of putting a person to death, because how can
     you put a person to death when it won't bring the people back?" she
     asked. "It would be on a person's conscience."
     The woman is Catholic and Judge Richard Matsch asked if she
     considered it a mortal sin to sentence someone to death.
     "Yes," said the woman, "a mortal sin."
     She was followed by a man who designs packaging for the medical
     industry. He said the death penalty would be appropriate in "a crime
     where someone shows no remorse. It might be a very violent crime."
     Another prospective juror interviewed Wednesday morning was a man
     who at first said the death penalty should be automatic for anyone
     convicted of premeditated murder. Later, under questioning by U.S.
     District Court Judge Richard Matsch, the man conceded that he could
     consider the character and background of the defendant before
     imposing a death sentence.
     The court is attempting to find a pool of 64 "death
     penalty-qualified" jurors from which a final panel of 12 jurors and
     six alternatives will be chosen.
     Under federal law, jurors must agree that they can impose the death
     penalty but will also consider other sentences if mitigating
     circumstances warrant.
     Nichols, 42, could receive the death penalty if he is convicted of
     the murder and conspiracy charges he faces.

           WOMAN ADMITS SLAPPING ADOPTED CHILD ON FLIGHT FROM RUSSIA
     October 8, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:30 p.m. EDT (0230 GMT)
     NEW YORK (AP) -- A Phoenix woman testified Wednesday that on a
     12-hour flight from Moscow she may have slapped one of the two
     Russian girls she and her husband adopted.
     Karen Thorne said she was "very frustrated" in her attempts to calm
     the young girl on the crowded jet. She said difficulties began when
     she and her husband, Richard, met the 4-year-olds at an orphanage in
     Voronezh, about 12 hours north of Moscow by train.
     She said one child cried frequently and the other was initially
     warm, but then became aggressive and hard to manage. She said the
     children were difficult to control on a shopping trip in Moscow and
     while waiting to board the plane to New York.
     Three Texas men who were on the flight with their own newly adopted
     children said they saw the Thornes hit the girls. The Thornes were
     arrested upon landing and the girls were placed in foster homes,
     first in New York and now in Arizona, where the Thornes are
     permitted supervised visits.
     The Thornes have been charged with assault, harassment and
     endangering the welfare of the children. The Thornes speak only
     English; the children only Russian.

Finaly getting back to reading some more of the book [1], Chpt. 9 in
This chapter deals with various aspects of social issues (eg rise of
national languages) and how they led to the growth of nationalism in
general. Toward the end of the chapter (pp. 265 in the hardback) these
idiots (don't know a better term) actualy have the audactity to claim that
Stephen Jay Gould is a neo-creationist, in short they claim that Gould holds
there is a 'higher power' (ie transcendance) directing evolution and the
impact of inhereted traits on society.
The author of this section has apparently never read a word that Gould has
written. Gould is known as a leading supporter of Punctuated Equilibria and
its various spawn, and with Ernst Meyr lead the battle against creationist
theories and others of that ilk. Gould and Meyr's theories flatly reject
transcendance as a force in evolutionary theory. Considering that no
supporter of transcendance in evolutionary theory has ever succesfuly
weathered a reasoned attack I simply stand in awe of the authors expectation
of the readers ignorance.
The more I read of this book the less respect I have for either author.
I previously recommended this book as an intellectual challenge at least,
I retract that recommendation. Don't waste your money on this drivel from
a couple of snake oil salesmen who continously contradict themselves and
pose flawed theory after flawed theory.

Well apparently you didn't comprehend what he was saying any better than the
authors of the book or your experts. However, I have no intention of bringing
this discussion onto the list past this responce. If you, or anybody else,
would like to see Gould's refutation of this claim in his own words then
refer to:
Scientist Confront Creationism
ed. L.R. Godfrey
ISBN 0-393-30154-0
Chpt. 8.
Darwin's Untimely Burial - Again!
pp. 139
This volume is a collection of articles by 15 of the top evolutionary
theorist (not all biologist) in the field. Worth the $7.95 this little book
You might also want to read "The Mismeasure of Man" (again).
[rhetorical questions, please don't send responces]
So your premise is that the evolutionary processes which form non-humans are
not the same forces acting on humans? You seriously mis-understand not only
Gould but modern evolutionary theory in toto. Sounds like you and not Gould
have embraced neo-creationism.
What relevant experts? THE relevent expert in evolutionary biology is Ernst
Meyr. Are you claiming that Meyr doesn't know what he is talking about?
Gould's premise, supported by Meyr and most other evolutionary biologist,
is that the human being is in fact a radicaly different animal than all
others. Not because of some magical force of transcendance but rather a
easily understand mechanism. The increase of cerebral capacity in concert
with exo-cerebral capacity (ie memory outside the brain), abstract
thinking, and language provide humans the tools to escape the purely
evolutionary process. Gould's claim, and what pisses so many people off, is
that man has reached a point where the major force in future development is
NOT evolutionary processes. It is quite similar to what happens when you have
10 computers sitting in a room and what happens when those 10 computers are
networked and given large hard-drives. You don't get evolution, you get revolution.
[that's as close to relevancy to this list as I can manage]

Bad analogy.
Can't say that I am motivated by this particular meme. I am ecstatic that
the company I work for in my day job (Tivoli Inc.) is coming out with a
series of security and crypto related products to be implimented by our
customers on a global enterprise level. None of which support GAK or backdoors.
Now whether our parent company IBM will have the cajones to carry through on
it is another question entirely. Exactly how we are going to sell these
products over-seas does concern me, especialy since our product is used by
many large corporations for enterprise managment in other countries besides
Canada or the US and they regularly use our Courier product to distribute
data across national borders (not to mention some pretty big ponds).
There are at least 10-12 people at Tivoli tech-support who 'have got it'.
If those blade guards keep me from getting a close shave then they shouldn't
be there.
Exactly, it's the message that is protected NOT the media.
Congratulations and best wishes on your future.

@_subject: SSZ & T1 upgrade 
Just a quick note to update you on the status of the T1 upgrade. It's going
to take us a few weeks longer to get resources in place than we expected but
there is some good news.
It turns out that SWBT can provide us a 2-year contract on a full T1 for
<$1500 setup and $350 a month. If we go for 5 years there is no install fee
and the fee is $250 a month. We are currently discussing various issues with
our current customers, examining our personal finances, and our market share
potential in our area for which contract to go for. I currently have a
2-year contract on the present equipment location. The potential for
purchasing the property will also be discussed. We can purchase a T1/T3
Linux compliant card that will mimic a NIC for less than $700. So, it looks
like we can do a complete upgrade to a T1 for less than $3k.
Provided we don't get in some sort of grid lock we hope to have something
setup and going within the next few weeks.
It is my personal desire to have something in place and fully functioning no
later than Thanksgiving. But then again, I would have already signed the
contract in order to get it going by Halloween. Alas, I am not the last word
anymore - the down side to business partners.
Even if both my current business partners decide they want out I can say
that I will have resources in place by Christmas to have us to a T1. So,
irrespective of what is decided the T1 will happen.
We will be keeping the ISDN as a backup and transient dial-in for users.
If you have any questions please direct them to 'consulting at ssz.com'.

     1992 shootout at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
     E. Michael Kahoe, a former head of the FBI's violent crime and major
     offenders section, told the court he was sorry for his actions.
     "I must live every day with the realism of what I've done," he said
     tearfully. "I will always be known as the agent who plead guilty to
     obstruction of justice in the Ruby Ridge case."
     Kahoe was sentenced by Judge Ricardo Urbina, who could have given
     him two years. The judge also ordered him placed on probation for
     two years after his release from federal prison.
     Kahoe's lawyers said his 26 years of unblemished law enforcement
     experience should be taken into account. Federal prosecutors urged
     the maximum sentence.
     In 1992, the wife and son of white separatist Randy Weaver were
     killed during a standoff with the FBI. A deputy U.S. marshal was
     also killed in the siege.
     As head of the FBI's major crimes section, Kahoe was responsible for
     preparing a critique of the FBI's performance at Ruby Ridge. Federal
     prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to hand over documents and
     later destroyed the report, which they were able to recreate from
     computer files.

   LA Times
   14-OCT-97
   Consumers Don't Trust Internet Enough To Share Their Credit Card
   Information
   ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 14, 1997-- More than one out of
   three Americans have become users of the Internet during the last
   year, primarily for information gathering, but decidedly not for
   shopping, according to a national survey reported today by a leading
   consumer researcher.
   "There is clearly something addictive about the availability of
   galaxies of information for the asking," said Britt Beemer, chairman
   of America's Research Group, the firm that conducted the research
   project, in his keynote address before the 21st Century Commerce &
   CALS Expo USA at the Orange County Convention Center.
   "However, it's a very different story for shopping," he adds, "where
   very few people (2.8 percent ) feel comfortable in using the Internet
   to make a purchase in cyberspace."
   Beemer, who pioneered the influence of fear of crime on shopping with
   his annual survey on the subject, says he is "surprised more people
   weren't actively patronizing the Internet to eliminate worry about
   their personal safety, particularly for shopping at night."
   When asked about the degree of trust they had for shopping at a store
   in the mall compared with a purchase via the Internet, respondents
   opting for the store (72.1 percent) outnumber Internet shoppers (6.7
   percent) by more than ten to one, the survey indicated.
   According to Beemer: "Most people (77.9 percent) are reluctant for
   security reasons to give their personal credit card data via the
   Internet to a virtual salesperson, but many others (26.9 percent)
   don't want to buy something they can't see and touch; 14.9 percent say
   they always buy in stores; 11.6 percent report they like to pay cash;
   and 11.1 percent simply enjoy shopping too much to let their computer
   have all the fun."
   The few products that do sell at all via the Internet include computer
   software, books, apparel, and home furnishings, but the percentages of
   people actually buying are nominal, Beemer says.
   Consumer use of the Internet to get information in influencing various
   purchasing decisions does appear to be increasing, with many people
   (45.9 percent) reporting they sought information prior to shopping,
   and 9.6 percent indicating they were searching for both information
   and advertising.
   Those who use the Internet say the reason they do so is to acquire
   information (68.4 percent); to chat with and meet people (7.1
   percent); and to keep track of their finances (6.1 percent).
   When it comes to information gathering, 41.0 percent are seeking the
   news of the day; 23.7 percent are getting data on companies; 12.8
   percent are looking for help in school work; 6.4 percent are checking
   out stock and bond prices related to their financial status; and 5.8
   percent are surfing for travel information, the study points out.
   "There is some hope down the road that people's fears and concern
   about using the Internet for various personal business purposes will
   ease," says Beemer.
   "When asked whether they would expect to make financial transactions
   in the future, nearly six out of ten said `no,' but nearly 10 percent
   (9.4 percent) answered in the affirmative," he reports.
   The survey was conducted during the last week of September, 1997 of a
   national sample of 1000 respondents. Of this number, 41.7 percent had
   no access to a computer either at home or at work; 24.6 percent both
   at home and at work; 17.7 percent at home; and 15.9 percent at work,
   only. The study has a margin of error of +/- 4.3 percent.
   America's Research Group is a leading consumer research firm,
   headquartered in Charleston, S.C. Its staff has interviewed three
   million Americans over the past dozen years, giving ARG the largest
   database of retail trends in America. Britt Beemer is the author of
   PREDATORY MARKETING, published early this year by William Morrow.

               SECRET SECURITY MESSAGES ON STAMPS CAN BE DECODED
     Postal Service Logo October 16, 1997
     Web posted at: 3:39 p.m. EDT (1939 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- The post office is preserving a bit of nostalgia
     from an era when children saved cereal box tops for the secret
     decoder rings. The new decoder isn't a ring, but it does the job by
     revealing secret messages hidden on some U.S. postage stamps.
     "It was done primarily as a anti-counterfeit measure, but we knew
     that collectors of all kinds would enjoy it as an interesting design
     element as well," said postal spokesman Barry Ziehl.
     You normally can't see the hidden image, but the post office is
     selling decoders to interested people. For $4.95 collectors can get
     a special lens that reveals the hidden message when placed over the
     stamp.
     The first hidden image was on a 32-cent U.S. Air Force stamp issued
     in September. With the decoder, viewers can see the letters USAF
     repeated over and over across the face of the stamp. The decoder has
     to be turned slightly from side to side to get the image to appear.

             SUBPOENA ISSUED FOR DATA BEHIND NEWSPAPER'S WEB SITE
      website October 16, 1997
     Web posted at: 8:40 p.m. EDT (0040 GMT)
     VENTURA, California (AP) -- In what could be a legal first, the
     Ventura County Star has been subpoenaed by attorneys in a murder
     case for information about people who have used the newspaper's
     Internet site. The defense wants to determine whether the jury pool
     has been contaminated.
     The subpoena, which asks for unpublished e-mail and demographics of
     people who participated in an online survey about the case, explores
     new territory between legal protections for the media and a
     defendant's right to a fair trial, said Terry Francke, a media
     attorney with the California First Amendment Coalition.
     "This is very new, and I suspect the courts will be grappling with
     more and more of these types of requests from attorneys as the
     medium grows," Francke said Wednesday.
     The Internet site detailed the Diana Haun murder trial. Haun was
     convicted September 28 of conspiracy, kidnapping and murder in the
     slaying of Sherri Dally, her lover's wife -- an act prosecutors said
     was a human sacrifice birthday present. The penalty phase of Haun's
     trial is scheduled to begin Monday.
     The subpoena was served this week by James Farley, the attorney for
     Haun's lover and alleged co-conspirator Michael Dally. His trial is
     set to begin November 24. Jurors will be bused to Ventura from
     adjoining Santa Barbara County.
     The Internet site stretches beyond the newspaper's circulation area
     in Ventura County, possibly contaminating jury pools in Santa
     Barbara County, said Len Newcomb, an investigator for Farley.
     "The media decided to make this a high-profile case and decided they
     wanted to reach a vast number of people," Newcomb said. "And the
     worst-case scenario is that we won't be able to find jurors who
     don't already have strong biases."
     Newcomb has filed subpoenas on 56 news organizations from Los
     Angeles to San Luis Obispo, requesting unpublished reader, listener
     and viewer response to the Haun coverage.
     The latest subpoena unquestionably invades legally protected
     discourse between readers and their newspapers, said Timothy J.

     "I don't have a problem providing information to defense attorneys
     that has already appeared in the newspaper, or in this case online,

Not shure exactly why, doesn't seem to be related to the OS or hardware, but
you obviously are aware that SSZ had some serious problems this afternoon. I
suspect (wild guess at best) that it was power related in some way.
Anyway, I'll be watching it all weekend.

           GOVERNORS WARN COLLECTING INTERNET TAXES WOULDN'T BE EASY
     Internet taxes October 17, 1997
     Web posted at: 11:12 p.m. EDT (0312 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's governors and local officials,
     already having difficulty collecting taxes on catalog sales, said
     Friday a bill aimed at restricting new taxes on the Internet would
     worsen their problems.
     "It's very similar," Republican Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio
     said at a press briefing. "We've had an ongoing problem in terms of
     how to handle that. We've been continuing to try and work that out
     with those businesses in the states that have the large mail-order
     catalogs."
     The National Governors' Association estimates states lose $4 billion
     in sales taxes annually from catalog sales. That's because states,
     cities and counties generally lack the authority to capture sales
     taxes on such sales if the catalog business is headquartered out of
     state.
     That problem could only intensify based on the projected growth of
     electronic commerce. Voinovich cited one estimate of $1.5 trillion
     in sales on the Internet by 2002.
     "I don't think this is the time for the federal Congress to rush
     into something that will have such a huge impact on state and local
     government," he said.
     Joining Voinovich to oppose the Internet tax bill were leaders from
     the National Association of Counties, National League of Cities and
     U.S. Conference of Mayors.
     Rep. Chris Cox, a Republican from California, and Sen. Ron Wyden, an
     Oregon Democrat, have sponsored similar bills that would bar any new
     taxes on computer transactions -- such as taxes on Internet access
     or online services -- for an unspecified time while Congress studies
     the whole issue.
     The bill would make an exception to the moratorium for income earned
     through an Internet service; local business license taxes, if the
     Internet provider is located within the appropriate jurisdiction;
     and sales or use taxes, so long as they are the same as charged for
     mail or telephone orders.
     "We would love to have the bill say what the sponsors say it says,"
     said Brian J. O'Neill, a Philadelphia city councilman, representing
     the National League of Cities. But O'Neill and others say the
     technical language of the bill contains a broad pre-emption of state
     and local taxes.
     Wyden spokesman David Seldin strongly disagrees.
     "We have bent over backwards to clarify language of the bill so
     there can be no questions" that local governments retain authority
     to levy the same taxes on the Internet that are assessed on catalog
     sales, Seldin said. The bill seeks to halt new local taxes aimed
     specifically at Internet businesses.
     One National Governors' Association official said the bill's wording
     would worsen the states' problem of collecting sales taxes on
     catalog sales.
     "We know that we have to sit down with the industry and make the
     sales tax work on Main Street, on catalogs and on Internet, in some
     simplified, clear and technologically neutral way," said Tim Masanz
     of the association's economic development group.
     "If Congress goes on record and says that Internet sales are the
     equivalent of catalog mail-order sales, those talks are doomed," he
     added.
     "I can understand their desire to fight that battle but it would
     certainly not do much good to create a situation where you are
     favoring one at-home purchase over another," said Seldin.

What is your problem Bill regarding cypherpunks-e you've made accussatory
comments regarding that list a couple of times now? It is simply another
member of the CDR just like SSZ or algebra.com - is your claim that each of
these has their own indipendant content? If so, catch a clue and realize
they don't unless their broke somehow and quit forwarding. If somebody on
cypherpunks-e submits something it gets gatewayed through SSZ (and hopefuly
others by now) just like traffic from one of the other member remailers. I
wanted to gateway cypherpunks-j as well but we decided folks might get
confused if there were something other than english on here. And
considering both the -e and -j are in Japan, new, and relatively
unadvertised does it really suprise you that they don't have a lot of English
based traffic from that end?
You must be the one(s) who keeps subscribing and unsubscribing to the 3 US
remailers from a variety of (forged?) aliases in the hopes of carrying on the
'moderation experiment' meme. Or perhaps your hope is to catch one of us
down and claim we're filtering because the traffic didn't show up from three
different sources. I can't speak for the other CDR operators but I can say
that SSZ cache's all mail originating on this end and sends it out to the
other remailer sites as soon as we come back online. So nothing gets missed
from SSZ. My internet provider is supposed to be cache'ing incoming mail
to SSZ if we go down and I hope the other remailers also cache their mail
as well. If not, oh well, I 'm not going to miss any sleep over it.
Just in case you missed it the other day, I believe Igor has started
gatewaying a new remailer as well because I saw a 'Test' message from a
cypherpunks mailing list I didn't recognize as one of the known remailer
hosts. If so that means we're at 5 remailers in the network. One of them in
Japan, which meets at least one of our goals to get a remailer node outside
the US. This is a GOOD thing.
My offer to gateway the CDR to any site that requests the subscription
stands. So, if you are operating a remailer with only a single feed point
and that point is not currently SSZ please send me email and I'll add your
site to my re-send list. As to cypherpunks-e, one of the other CDR sites
should consider adding them to their re-send/subscription list.

ps Regarding SSZ's downtime yesterday, at this point don't have a clue
   why the system crashed without warning and then cored when it came
   back up. Once I got home and did a hard reboot it has worked without
   a glitch. Though we still have intermittent droppages of the ISDN
   link lasting 1-5 minutes. I have turned in another trouble call to
   SWBT in the hopes of them fixing it. That makes the 5th ISDN
   trouble ticket in 4 weeks. I think SWBT gets lonely if I don't call
   them at least once a week or else their field folks really have
   forgotten how to write...

Upon further digging at my request they determined that indeed there had
been some sort of cable throw yesterday. They issued me a trouble ticket
number and will check the line. Considering the intermittent nature of the
drop my suspicion is a bad punch-down. If this is so we should see the line
stabalize sometime this afternoon.

                 FBI HIRES NUCLEAR PHYSICIST TO HEAD CRIME LAB
     FBI crime lab October 18, 1997
     Web posted at: 2:27 p.m. EDT (1827 GMT)
     From Correspondent Terry Frieden
     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI hired the former head of a government
     nuclear weapons laboratory to direct its troubled crime lab, even
     though he has no background in forensic science.
     The FBI had promised to seek an experienced crime lab scientist from
     outside the government following a stinging Justice Department
     report on the lab last spring.
     But the man chosen for the post is Donald M. Kerr Jr., 58, a
     physicist-engineer who from 1979 to 1985 headed the government's Los
     Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed.
     The FBI acknowledged that Kerr's selection after the National
     Whistleblowers Center disclosed his name at a news conference
     Friday.
     "It just seems dumbfounding and implausible that they would not hire
     a world-class forensic scientist to take over the crime lab," center
     Director Stephen Kohn said.
     The selection also was criticized by the National Association of
     Criminal Defense Lawyers.
     "Once again, the FBI has dealt with Congress and the public with
     incredible arrogance," said the group's vice president, William
     Moffitt.
     Federal Bureau of Investigation officials defended the hiring of
     Kerr, saying he is the renowned scientist the agency was looking for
     to beef up its crime lab.
     "He has vast experience in managing large lab operations and a long
     track-record of successfully revitalizing labs," an FBI source told
     CNN.
     A formal announcement of Kerr's hiring is expected Tuesday.
  'This is not somebody from the outside'
     FBI building
     Kris Kolesnik, senior counselor to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
     one of the harshest critics of the FBI, said Kerr's work at Los
     Alamos and more recently for a major defense contractor make him a
     "real government insider."
     "This is not somebody from the outside who's going to bring a fresh
     breath of air," Kolesnik said.
     Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich blasted the
     world-renowned crime lab in April for flawed scientific work and
     inaccurate testimony in major cases, including the Oklahoma City
     bombing. Bromwich called for a new lab director with a scientific
     background "preferably in forensic science."
     Meanwhile, another flap over the crime lab erupted Friday when chief
     lab whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst said that in examining FBI lab
     reports recently released under the Freedom of Information Act, he
     found that five more FBI examiners had altered lab reports.
     "In the last week, I have found five more people that have been
     altering cases -- five more that the inspector general didn't find,"
     Whitehurst said.

No, Bill, the cypherpunks-e list was announced by me and it was announced as
a *specific* member of the existing CDR started at my specific request. Only
the cypherpunks-j was ever announced as the indipendant list, which I
intended to change. I further sent out a note requesting feedback on
non-English traffic and it's acceptance on the existing CDR. I received
nothing but smart-ass replies so we decided not to gateway that traffic but
leave the cypherpunks-j traffic fully indipendantly. That lack of responce
is what motivated the cypherpunks-e list. It was nearly a week after the -j list that the -e came online because I had to work that weekend and the -j
operator was going to Australia.
It is still 'broken' in that the mailer software they use doesn't accept
submissions with blank subject: lines. As a consequence I get several
bounces a day, usualy from anonymous accounts, that I simply /dev/null.
Whether this is a bug or a feature is up to your own interpretation.
I am looking into putting something in place so that SSZ puts something
on the traffic that is subject: blank since the -j and -e remailer software
can't have this behaviour turned off.
About the only good thing I can say is that I got a $150 credit and the
phone bill is $70/month for the 3 analog lines so I get to ride free
dial-in's on SWBT's dollar for two months.
The ISDN seems to be relatively stable since turning in the trouble call and
doing the testing, which showed 100% reliability (right).

IBM has such a non-disclosure agreement that apparently signs over to them

Fortunately I had other pre-existing agreements and when I signed the paper
as a function of employment I added a proviso that I had a consultancy as
well as pre-existing non-disclosures that limited their rights to my work
to only that performed while on-the-clock. Two years later they have never
contacted me regarding this so I assume they accepted it. I know of another
engineer here who said that such proviso's didn't apply to him because he
was under pre-existing contracts with the government (in various ways) that
prevented that sort of contract with him. They didn't refuse him employment
Contracts are contracts, if you don't like a part of it then mark it out and
put your own proviso's in their. If they accept it, by paying you wages for
work, then you are pretty much done with such broad intellectual property
That's the nice thing about contracts, as a signatory you have a right to
review and modify the contract. Use that right.

   Nothing says "GREED" like a politician with too much idle time. When
   will there be an end to oppressive taxation. I'm not apposed to paying
   taxes, but good Lord, do they have to tax everything. I think we need
   to get the air conditioning taken out of the government buildings, so
   they don't sit around thinking up new and better ways to put the
   screws to the people who already pay their way.

   all of us easier, more logical alternative solutions in energy ,
   education, food , work and communications ...how can politicians
   destroy something this good and free ? one way is with taxes....lets
   stand united against the politicians corrupt tricks to start
   manipulating this wonderful new tool for growth and democracy...lets

   I am not at all surprised that some brain-dead politicians who would
   sell their daughters into slavery for a little cold cash would attempt
   to tax the Internet.

   No article I've yet to review has provided a coherent argument for the
   public-policy which would be satisfied by Internet taxation. Nothing
   concerns me more than politic automatons who cannot resist the urge of
   government interference in commerce for the sake of government
   control. Few realize that the technology industry of the past decade
   is primarily responsible for our comparative advantage over foreign
   markets. Taxing Internet activity will be the foothold which turns
   this tide.

   The Internet is already taxed through the existing telephone tax
   collections. Special taxes for the Internet is simply another example
   of double taxation. Most of us are fully aware of the objectives
   behind such efforts and we have had it up to our noses with this
   nonsense.
   The time to put a halt to this is already past due.

   Doesn't local government already collect taxes from our local phone
   and cable companies that most of us use to get to our Internet Service
   Providers? That being the case, we are already being taxed once. This
   appears to be an attempt at taxing us twice for the same service.
   Think about it......

   Michael Benezra - 02:37pm Oct 19, 1997 ET ( of 7)
   Any government that would dare tax the Internet will find Internet
   businesses fleeing that country and operating from a different local.
   After all, on the Internet it does not matter where you are, but what
   you provide to your customers. If you operate from the US or Hong Kong
   does not make a difference to anyone.

           GOVERNORS WARN COLLECTING INTERNET TAXES WOULDN'T BE EASY
     Internet taxes October 17, 1997
     Web posted at: 11:12 p.m. EDT (0312 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's governors and local officials,
     already having difficulty collecting taxes on catalog sales, said
     Friday a bill aimed at restricting new taxes on the Internet would
     worsen their problems.
     "It's very similar," Republican Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio
     said at a press briefing. "We've had an ongoing problem in terms of
     how to handle that. We've been continuing to try and work that out
     with those businesses in the states that have the large mail-order
     catalogs."
     The National Governors' Association estimates states lose $4 billion
     in sales taxes annually from catalog sales. That's because states,
     cities and counties generally lack the authority to capture sales
     taxes on such sales if the catalog business is headquartered out of
     state.
     That problem could only intensify based on the projected growth of
     electronic commerce. Voinovich cited one estimate of $1.5 trillion
     in sales on the Internet by 2002.
     "I don't think this is the time for the federal Congress to rush
     into something that will have such a huge impact on state and local
     government," he said.
     Joining Voinovich to oppose the Internet tax bill were leaders from
     the National Association of Counties, National League of Cities and
     U.S. Conference of Mayors.
     Rep. Chris Cox, a Republican from California, and Sen. Ron Wyden, an
     Oregon Democrat, have sponsored similar bills that would bar any new
     taxes on computer transactions -- such as taxes on Internet access
     or online services -- for an unspecified time while Congress studies
     the whole issue.
     The bill would make an exception to the moratorium for income earned
     through an Internet service; local business license taxes, if the
     Internet provider is located within the appropriate jurisdiction;
     and sales or use taxes, so long as they are the same as charged for
     mail or telephone orders.
     "We would love to have the bill say what the sponsors say it says,"
     said Brian J. O'Neill, a Philadelphia city councilman, representing
     the National League of Cities. But O'Neill and others say the
     technical language of the bill contains a broad pre-emption of state
     and local taxes.
     Wyden spokesman David Seldin strongly disagrees.
     "We have bent over backwards to clarify language of the bill so
     there can be no questions" that local governments retain authority
     to levy the same taxes on the Internet that are assessed on catalog
     sales, Seldin said. The bill seeks to halt new local taxes aimed
     specifically at Internet businesses.
     One National Governors' Association official said the bill's wording
     would worsen the states' problem of collecting sales taxes on
     catalog sales.
     "We know that we have to sit down with the industry and make the
     sales tax work on Main Street, on catalogs and on Internet, in some
     simplified, clear and technologically neutral way," said Tim Masanz
     of the association's economic development group.
     "If Congress goes on record and says that Internet sales are the
     equivalent of catalog mail-order sales, those talks are doomed," he
     added.
     "I can understand their desire to fight that battle but it would
     certainly not do much good to create a situation where you are
     favoring one at-home purchase over another," said Seldin.

              WILL HEADLESS HUMAN CLONES GROW ORGANS IN 10 YEARS?
     'Human Cloning' graphic October 19, 1997
     Web posted at: 8:39 p.m. EDT (0039 GMT)
     LONDON (AP) -- Headless human clones will be used to grow organs and
     tissues for transplant surgery in the next five to 10 years, a
     leading authority on the ethics of human cloning predicted Sunday.
     Dr. Patrick Dixon, author of "The Genetic Revolution," which
     forecast the cloning of animals, made the prediction after The
     Sunday Times reported that British scientists have created a frog
     embryo without a head.
     Scientists believe the technique used to create the headless frogs
     could be adapted to grow human organs such as hearts, kidneys,
     livers and pancreases in an embryonic sac living in an artificial
     womb, the paper said.
     Many scientists believe human cloning is inevitable following the
     July 1996 birth of Dolly, the world's first cloned mammal. She was
     created at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh using cells from a
     sheep's udder.
     "I predict that there will be great pressure to combine cloning
     technology with the creation of partial fetuses, missing heads, arms
     or legs as organ factories for tomorrow's people," Dixon told the
     British news agency, Press Association.
     "These will be developed on an experimental level somewhere in the
     world in countries where there is little or no gene legislation
     within the next 5-10 years because of the overwhelming demand," he
     said.
     "The demand is there, the technology is almost there as well," he
     said.
     Dixon called for an urgent global biotechnology summit to examine
     every aspect of genetics, and provide the foundations for
     international agreements. International inconsistencies on various
     aspects of genetic engineering, including human cloning, urgently
     need to be ironed out, he said.
     "Genetic engineering is a very exciting technology, it has the power
     to feed the world, cure disease but you do have to ask fundamental
     questions before it is too late," Dixon said.
     "The headless frog embryo is another example of the way the
     technology is racing far ahead of public understanding," he said.
     "We must get the thinking in place which looks over the horizon
     beyond today's headlines to what tomorrow will bring," Dixon said.
     "Scientists have been making up the rules as they go along."
  Genes manipulated to suppress frog's head
     Jonathan Slack, professor of developmental biology at Bath
     University, told The Sunday Times that he created headless frog
     embryos by manipulating certain genes -- and used the same technique
     to suppress development of a tadpole's trunk and tail as well.
     The headless frog embryos have not been allowed to live longer than
     a week because under British government rules, embryos are not
     considered animals until they are a week old, the paper said.
     Slack believes the breakthrough could be applied to human embryos
     because the same genes perform similar functions in both frogs and
     humans, The Sunday Times said.
     The newspaper said the lamb and frog techniques could be combined so
     that people needing transplants could have organs "grown to order"
     from their own cloned cells.
     These organs would exactly match the patient and there would
     therefore be no danger of rejection. It would also ease the shortage
     of organs for transplant, The Sunday Times said.
     Slack told the paper that using intact human embryos would not be
     possible because they would have to be killed.
     "It occurred to me a half-way house could be reached," he was quoted
     as saying. "Instead of growing an intact embryo, you could
     genetically reprogram the embryo to suppress growth in all the parts
     of the body except the bits you want, plus a heart and blood
     circulation."
     Growing parts of human embryos to cultivate organs could bypass many
     legal restrictions and ethical concerns, because without a brain or
     central nervous system the organisms may not technically qualify as
     embryos.
  Professor: 'No ethical issues'
     Lewis Wolpert, professor of biology as applied to medicine at
     University College London, called Slack's suggestions sensible and
     feasible.
     "There are no ethical issues because you are not doing any harm to
     anyone," The Sunday Times quoted him as saying.
     But Oxford University animal ethicist Professor Andrew Linzey told
     the newspaper: "It is morally regressive to create a mutant form of
     life."
     "It's scientific fascism because we would be creating other beings
     whose very existence would be to serve the dominant group," he was
     quoted as saying.

Forwarded message:
Come on, tell us how you really feel...
What if your design specificaly includes self-modifying code for reasons of
execution speed or some recursive efficiency? Glad to know I don't have to
compete with you on those sorts of jobs...thanks.
Well I would include all the possible functions I would need and then keep
some sort of array. Each branch point would depend upon the contents of that
array. When the program starts it would use either some default
configuration or perhaps the 'last-state' of the engine on the previous run.
Then as the contents of the array changed the dynamic configuration of the
sub-routines would change.
Another good mechanism is to store addresses in immediate mode, which means
the address is hard-coded. Then dynamicaly change the contents of the address
of that address. I once wrote a machine code utility that cleared large
blocks of RAM 256 byte pages at a time. Each time the code ran it would go
through and incriment the address stored in that address a fixed amount, the
page size, and then jumped back to the beginning of this single loop. Ran
very quickly. I used it to clear video ram faster than the os functions

        JUSTICE SEEKS $1 MILLION A DAY CONTEMPT FINE AGAINST MICROSOFT
     Microsoft logo October 20, 1997
     Web posted at: 1:29 p.m. EDT (1729 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department asked a federal court
     Monday to hold the computer software giant Microsoft Corp. in
     contempt for requiring personal computer manufacturers to license
     and distribute its Internet browser.
     The department said the company violated a 1995 court order the
     government obtained to bar the company from anticompetitive
     licensing practices. The government sought a $1 million a day fine.
     "Microsoft is unlawfully taking advantage of its Windows monopoly to
     protect and extend that monopoly," Attorney General Janet Reno told
     reporters. Janet Reno
     "This is a very serious abuse," said Assistant Attorney General Joel
     I. Klein, head of the antitrust division. He said Microsoft's action
     was designed to undermine the dominant market position of its major
     competitor for Internet browsers, Netscape.
     Internet browsers are important, Klein said, because they "could
     erode Microsoft's operating system monopoly" in the Windows
     operating system. "This kind of product forcing is an abuse of
     monopoly power and we seek to put an end to it."
     Klein emphasized that the Justice Department is still investigating
     other practices by Microsoft but declined to give details.
     The Justice Department objected to Microsoft's requirement that
     computer manufacturers who want to license the Windows 95 operating
     system also license its internet browser, known as Internet
     Explorer. Most personal computer makers install Windows 95 at the
     factory.
     Klein said, "These are two different products." He said they should
     be sold as two separate products, but he adamantly said the
     government was not taking sides in the war for browser market share
     between Microsoft and Netscape, whose browser is known as Navigator,
     or any other company.
     "Each of Microsoft's products should compete on its own merits,"
     Klein said.

                    U.S. SAID VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER ATTACK
     cyberwarfare October 21, 1997
     Web posted at: 5:02 a.m. EDT (0902 GMT)
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report concluding the nation is vulnerable to
     electronic warfare was delivered to the White House Monday by a
     presidential commission.
     The classified findings and recommendations of the Commission on
     Critical Infrastructure Protection say the danger of computer
     attacks that could shut down communications and power grids is real
     and requires early action.
     "Today, the right command sent over the Internet to a power
     generating station's control computer could be just as effective as
     a backpack full of explosives and the perpetrator would be harder to
     identify and apprehend," the panel wrote in its executive summary to
     the report.
     The report recommends stepping up research and establishing a
     nationwide program to educate people on the scope of the problem. It
     also recommends revising existing laws to ensure protection against
     electronic attacks through the Internet.
     "Law has failed to keep pace with technology. Some laws capable of
     promoting assurance are not as clear or effective as they could be,"
     the panel wrote.
     Because revamping laws would be a "lengthy and massive undertaking,"
     the commission offered several suggestions to jump-start the
     process.
     "We identified existing laws that could help the government take the
     lead and serve as a model of standards and practices for the private
     sector," it wrote. "We identified other areas of law that can enable
     infrastructure owners and operators to take precautions
     proportionate to the threat."
     P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman, said a task force composed of
     representatives from several government agencies will review the
     report and come up with recommendations, which is likely to take the
     rest of the year.
     In addition, an advisory committee headed by former Sen. Sam Nunn,
     D-Ga., and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick will work
     with the private sector on ways to protect against cyber attacks.
     At a conference on computer security two weeks ago, commission
     Chairman Robert T. Marsh said the ability to do serious harm over
     the Internet is real.
     "While a catastrophic cyber attack has not occurred, we have enough
     isolated incidents to know that the potential for disaster is real
     and the time to act is now," he said.

Yes, there are occassional breakdowns in the communications between the
list remailers. The reason that there are several of them is if one goes
down for more than a few minutes the whole lists doesn't go down which would
occur if we were still on a single remailer.
In cases such as this I would suggest checking the archives provided by a
couple of sites (I thought since I don't check the archives).
Things get lost on occassion?

@_subject: SSZ - ISDN repairs today... 
As most of you are aware SSZ has been experiencing a great deal of ISDN
stability issues the last 4-6 weeks (since the move to the new location).
To date we have been through a cable throw from one trunk line to another
which involved switching CO's. Since that throw we have seen intermittent
outages lasting from a minute or so up to 15 minutes (perhaps longer but I
didn't see them since logging is not always turned on).
Well I get up this morning and find the ISDN exhibiting the exact same sort
of intermittetent outages from last weekend, except now they ain't so
intermittent. Seems the cool weather and light rain have exacerbated the
issue such that we are in a nearly continous connect-disconnect cycle. We
are still passing packets with no loss, beit slowly.
I called SWBT and they are sending a installer out to put the line on
another distinct pair as well as putting in a repeater to boost the
Expect there to be intermittent outages of an hour or more today. If the
fixes work we should be rock-solid again.

It isn't a rationale, its reality. This view is not moderated by political
or ideological beliefs but the harsh reality that things don't work the
right way all the time.
Your implied base assumption is that the reason is always the same. I
seriously doubt it.
The process is so simple it ain't funny. I believe, but won't guarantee it,
that we are all using a procmail script to remove duplicate messages, and
that is all the 'distributor/reflector duplicate-filter algorithms' there
is. Unless one of the other repeaters is doing something more complicated
they haven't said. In short, you are under the misconception that this is
something special, it ain't.
SSZ receives traffic from the other remailers at cpunks at ssz.com, just a
normal user account, which has the procmail script filtering duplicates. It
then forwards to cypherpunks at ssz.com, which is the majordomo managed list.
cpunks at ssz.com as well as the rest of the subscribers get their traffic from
here. If the procmail breaks then I get a mail loop at SSZ and my box fills
up and lets me know pretty quickly something is broke because majordomo
recognizes this through the X-loop: and kills them in that case as well as
sending postmaster (me) all kinds of nifty hints. The other sites in this
case still filter duplicates so things still don't run away.
outbound and have them add cpunks to their outbound list.
Sounds good to me...
No, SSZ has full inbound and outbound traffic queing for up to 4 days
or the hard drive fills up here and at my ISP.

@_subject: CDR Operators & interaction... 
I have received a couple of pieces of mail that concern me. The content
seems to indicate that people have one or both of two basic misconceptions
about the CDR:
 -  The operators do not communicate between ourselves unless one of us
    begins to recieve duplicates or other indications of problems at
    another site. Outside of that we simply don't communicate.
 -  I am NOT in any way the moderator, central clearing house, or in
    any other manner concerned with the operation of the 'network' of
    remailers. I operarate SSZ as a home-based business and the
    CDR is motivated by my personal interest in the various issues
    as well as the fact that it costs nothing extra for me to carry.
The remailer network was initialy instituted by Igor and myself in order to
keep the Cypherpunks mailing list alive after the toad.com announcement that
the mailing list was going away due to the various issue related to the
moderation experiment. The entire point was to create a system such that it
was simple and could not be compromised by any single operator.
Furthermore, if you or anyone you know is interested in joining the CDR as a
remailer node, archive site, mail-news gateway, etc. then send a message to
the list requesting the various operators for feeds. SSZ has a standing
invitation to anyone who desires to have a full-time participant.

Forwarded message:
It occurs to me that this entire question is really of much larger social
 -  do babysitters in your home have an inherent right to not be monitored
    in case they harm the child?
 -  do operators of vehicles on public roads have an inherent right to
    privacy about the vehicle?
 -  do businesses have the right to monitor the uses that their systems
    are put to?
 -  do public officials have an inherent right to privacy about their
    actions related to their office?
etc. ad nausium...
These various issues can be broken down into two simple questions that
once answered genericaly can be applied to the specific cases.
The bottem line is:
Does the owner of a resource have an inherent right to control that
resource and if so what are the boundaries?
Does the user of a resource have rights outside the purvue of the owner
of that resource and if so what are the boundaries?

But what are the boundaries? How do you tell when a particular action has
crossed them?
They don't? What if the resource is a requirement for a normal life?
Is simple ownership a license to steal or abuse? How do you even describe
them in a general sense? What if the owner of a resource decides to change
the fair use policy? Shouldn't the user have a say in what those conditions
are? Is simply agreeing to be a user of a resource license for the owner to
use that dependency to manipulate the user?
No, your answers are better than the other persons but not by much.

Monty, without a doubt that is the stupidest thing you have ever said on
this list.
If a company makes your employment contingent on something you don't like,
change jobs. DON'T need laws, don't want laws that get involved in this.
This is *STRICTLY* a civil contract issue between the two parties, PERIOD.
Why is it that so many people start discussions regarding social issues and
then meander into government issues, or visa versa, without ANY recognition
of their schizophrenia?
Personaly, I blame it on spin doctors like yourself.
At least I have the satisfaction knowing that in no way am I contributing to
putting food on your table, making your car payments, or paying off your drug

I must disagree there. She has the qualifications to obtain employment in
may corporations and such. As a matter of fact, unless she happens to be
inequivicaly wedded to live in her current abode have her send me her
resume. I will be quite happy to submit it to the H/R department at Tivoli
(an IBM company I admit) for a position in our training department (last
time I checked they had like 90 positions they wanted to fill globaly). I
can guarantee the cost of living is somewhat lower than NY here in Texas
and her pay will most likely be higher than current. There is also the
opportunity for global travel if she is interested and were to get hired.
Sending out resumes is cheap, about $.40 a company.
Obviously this is open to alternate interpretation depending upon to what
lengths the party is willing to go to change their life. Skills are what you
sell not a particular job title or duty set.

Wrong, this income not only must be reported but in every state that I am
aware of you need a license to legaly do baby-sitting for hire.  Many
states, such as Texas, won't let you do it from your home. You even
need one in Texas to baby-sit peoples pets, though you can do that from
your home if your yard is big enough for the number of pets you are licensed to sit.
Have Janice go to jail for tax-evasion and lack of a license isn't going to
do her or her kids a lick of good.
Not counting long-distance to grandma and grandpa, other relatives.
Let's combine electricity and gas into a single bill, since this will cover
both of these. You're probably looking at $150 - $200 a month with 6 kids.
You're also leaving out water and waste-water which adds another $50-$100
considering 6 kids and their baths and such.
Hell, I'm single and come close to this and food costs in Texas are a LOT
lower than in New York. Though I do eat out at lunch every weekday. And no,
I don't go partying regularly at all. Way too busy with work (>16hrs/day
5 days a week & 16-20 on weekends) to do that other than a couple of times a
month. I went to the store today and bought enough food for 4 days and it
cost me $30. So that comes to something like $250 - $300 for me not counting
lunches, and that's for just a single person. Multiply that for 6 and the
numbers are considerably higher.
Man, you must not know the kids I know. Not only do they eat a lot they
waste a lot because they seldom finish 'adult' size portions.
Not exactly true. The hand-me downs are 1-gen old when the first kid gets
them. By the 2nd or 3rd kid the clothes will be too worn out and soiled
to wear. My parents were dirt poor and I got lots of hand-me-downs as a kid
and can speak from personal experience here. They might last two kids.
While we're at it let's not forget the various school supplies and other
things the kids will need, medical and dental costs (my experience is that
government agencies don't cover 100%), then there's toys, books, music, etc.
Even considering buying everything used and using the public library this is
going to be a very tight budget.
You also left out auto costs such as gasoline, oil, normal maintenance,
insurance, registration, etc. Birthdays, Christmas, Mothers Day, Fathers
Day, movies with friends and such, hair-cuts (it's clear she won't have time
to do that herself), pets, kids hobbies, life insurance, etc.
Nope, your figures are WAY off.
My guess is that you are either single or if married your wife has her own
career and you each make at least $45k. Also, no kids or more than one pet.
You don't raise good kids by sticking them in a closet wearing burlap sacks
and feeding them scraps.

@_subject: Orthogonal 
I believe the first definition for orthogonal is not the vector or Cartesian
definition but rather from geometry.
Where, for example, polygonal means a closed shape made up from many line
segments, orthogonal means a closed shape made from line segments at right
angles to each other. The simplest being the square.
DeCarte used the concept of ortho- to describe the relationship between the
axis of his measurement system, hence orthogonal. Strictly speaking
orthogonal is a misnomer and should be orthometric or 'measurements at right
I am interested in how orthogonal obtained its variety of other meanings. I
run across it in linguistics, computer science, philosophy, etc. In most of
them it means some sort of pure or simple relationship. Unfortunately I
can't find any sort of description of how it got expanded this way.

I can see the union 'build complicated things out of basic building blocks'
and the use of Occam's Razor (I'm as lazy as any other programmer) but fail
to see how this maps to anything relating to the concept of orthogonal.
Which clearly doesn't have any inherent minimalist cast.

I work everyday with the NSA, CIA, Dod, Army, SAIC, all the phone companies,

behind Tivoli comming out with their new Security Management application
because vendors required us to move away from our custom databases and
toward industry standards (Oracle, Sybase, Informix, DB2, DBMX, etc.) *AND*
at the same time requiring a better security mechanism than the existing one
we use (DES & Kerberos based).
The reality of the market does not support your thesis.
Are they involved with the new Cryptographic Standard projects of the

them involved in any of the work I have had access to so far; much to my own

Actualy si (scalars) can be rational, real, or complex. It is also possible to use more general structures such as fields. [1]
Note that complex numbers numbers may be used, in other words a vector can
be used to multiply another vector.
A vector of vectors, and you haven't even really defined vector yet...:(
Are you saying:
(c1*v1)+(c2*v2)+...+(cn*vn) <> 0
where at least one ci is <>0, is some sort of test for membership in a vector
space? What about,
(1/c1*v1)+(-1/c2*v2)+(0*v3)...+(0*vn) = 0,
     1         -1
if so it should be clear that except for the case of c=0 there is always a
way to take two, which is clearly more than one, of the scalars and cause
the sum to be zero. Now if you have a single non-zero scalar multiplier then
it seems reasonable that you can create such a structure that is always <>0.
In other words 'are expressible in'?
              ^^^^^^^^^^^
              Need to better define this one.
The operations that are applicable to a vector space are: [1]
1.  Associative law of addition: (x+y)+z = x+(y+z)
2.  Commutative law of addition: x+y=y+x
3.  Existance of zero: x+0=x for all x in V
4.  Existance of inverses: x+(-x)=0
5.  Associative law of multiplication: a(bx)=(ab)x
6.  Unital law: 1*x=x
7.  First distributive law: a(x+y)=(a*x)+(a*y)
8.  Second distributive law: (a+b)*x=(a*x)+(b*x)
where x is of the form 'asubn(x^n)+bsubn-1(x^n-1)+...+asub1x+asub0'
This is a remarkably circular definition to present. In clearer wording;
The set of vectors S is expressible in a vector space V iff S is contained in While this may be a requirement or test for membership in a vector space (as
used below) it doesn't qualify as a definition.
                                                 ^^^
                                                 set of what?
In other words, any 'vector' can be expressed as the sum of the
multiplication of unit elements by some set of scalars.
Is this definition something you just wrote or would you be so kind as to
give the reference if it isn't.
This definition uses 'basis', doesn't define it. You can't use a term to
define the term, it's called circular reasoning. My question still stands,
can you please better define 'basis'. Or is your claim that basis is simply
a way of stating 'elements of unit magnitude'?
Furthermore, a definition of vector space has nothing to do with orthogonal
measurement systems, it does have to do with polynomials. It just so
happens that this sort of geometry shares the same sort of rules, that
doesn't make them the same thing. There is nothing in your description, in
particular the nifty little (*,*,*,...*)'s that implies any sort of
measurement system based on line-segment axis that are 90 degrees apart,
merely that there is more than one variable (ie x,y,z,...a) involved. Vector space -  a vector space is a set of objects or elements that can be
                added together and multiplied by numbers (the result being
                an element of the set), in such a way that the usual rules
                of calculations hold. [1]

   'Dracula' is a word derived from 'dracul' meaning dragon and was given
   to Vlad Tepish, whose name means 'son of the devil', he was further known
   as Vlad the Impaler because he would impale people on poles and place them
   along the roads in Transylvania. When he died in 1496 his head was
   impaled on a stick as well.

Forwarded message:
Which orthogonality are you speaking of?
Are you talking linguistics, philosophy, or computer? Consider, historicaly
the point of 'orthogonality' was to indicate a  *non-overlapping* or
reducable structure, something which provides a reference to evaluate other
Orthogonal implies there is intersection, it's hard to have a closed
geometric shape (-gonal) or a right angle (ortho-) axis system without them.
Good, I understand how it is used in vector spaces and don't really get my
jollies off on arguing on unrelated issues. What I *would* like to
know is how a mathematical term related to geometry and right angles got
expanded *historicaly* to mean something completely unrelated. I don't think
a linear algebra book is relevant to this question, despite the protestations
of the techno-masturbatory ot the contrary.
There are a whole host of users on this list who live by strawman arguments.
I am glad to see you aren't one of them (apparently).

Bill, more than 2,000 people have dies from planes being blown up by
terrorist in the last 10 years alone.
Old Prince Ferdinand, you know the bloke whose death started WWI allegedly,
had an attempt on his life the morning of his death via bomb. He shrugged it
off and got shot.
Stalin had millions killed for political reasons.
The Isrealis have killed tens of thousands in their expanionisitic,
non-survivalist motivated actions.
The US backed Central American death squads have killed hundreds of
thousands if not millions.
People kill for religion, politics, insanity, and fun.
Terrorism has a long history in human culture.
Yours is a unreasoned view.

Yes, Bill it is. *ANY* use of violence for anything other than IMMEDIATE
SELF-DEFENCE is terrorism. Simply being on the *winning* side does not make
your actions any less terrorist. Any use of violence except in immediate
self-defence is in effect saying "do what I say or I kill you". THAT is the
definition of terrorism.
Bill, I have never done anything but been willing to let my views stand on
their own two feet.
Well, if we look at Jan. 1, 1900 as the starting date for our accounting I
would estimate that somewhere between 2 to 5 BILLION poeple have died due
to terrorist acts.
It doesn't make it right whether it is the Khmer Rhouge, SOG, Shinning Path,
The SLA, CIA in Laos or Columbia, Ruby Ridge, KAL 007, TWA 800, IRA, SDS,
Black Panthers, or some old lady in Ill. who wants to committ suicide.
When you kill or threaten somebody for what they believe or what they are you
are committing terrorism.
*NOTHING* justifies turning a democracy into a police state, that is the
WHOLE point to democracies in the first place; NOTHING justifies a police
state. Go back and read the Declaration of Independance again, you missed
something in previous readings.
If anything Bill, *you* are the one who has unwittingly (I hope) swallowed
their jism.
If you yank on a dogs chain and it bites you, it isn't the dogs fault.

Forwarded message:
If we as individuals can't make our own decisions about what is best for us,
what makes you think some stranger will do any better? By our initial
assumption we are assured that they can't make adequate decisions about
their own life. Every form of government other than democracy assumes a
priori that noble oblige is prima facia. To paraphrase an old questions of
politics, who governs the governors? Or do you feel we have found angels in
the form of kings?
Democracy says, you don't need a governor (in that sense). You ARE held
responsible for your actions AFTER your actions, not for simply thinking
about them or even speaking them.
Juries are supposed to be composed of your peers, not who the prosecution or
defence believe will best support their case. It should be that the first 12
poeple called who don't have a valid excuse to be excused are the jury, the
next 12 are the back-ups. This would guarantee that getting a conviction for
anything other than the most heinous crime with the most explicit and
incontrovertible evidence will be well nigh impossible, as it should be in a
democracy. It should be a mother fucker to put somebody in jail in this
Judges should not be able to tell someone they need permissio to file a
legal complaint. Nor should a judge be able to refuse a juries request to
have testimony transcribed because it costs too much. That isn't justice,
that is systemic expediency and criminal indiference.
Which means we should have the lowest number of incarcerated individuals
instead of the most.
Doesn't work what way? Consider, other than democracy, that every form of
government has an implicit assumption that there is some base sets of
activities that citizens should be permitted and they will be happy. Those
activities are determined, except in democracies, by those in power who are
NOT elected or otherwise responsible to the people as a whole. In a
democracy the people are given the opportunity to make up their mind what to
do with their lives and property without having to obtain permission from
some authority. Why? Because there isn't such an authority to get permission
from in the first place.
In what way?
Paying a government to keep the park clean and mowed and the lights on at
night or my streets well paved and de-iced in winter is not quite the same
thing as having black-suited ninja wann-be's kicking my door in at 2AM
because I choose to smoke a joint or even grow my own weed; or spend six
weeks in jail for possessing vitamins that some cop THINKS is drugs; or
perhaps because I happen to be a doctor and know how to read and might take
exception to being told what I can or can't say; or because I might be of
Jewish decent or a Muslim or a Catholic or Anglo or Negro; or etc. etc.
There is a reason behind the madness of "Congress shall make no law...".

No, it doesn't - your definition of democracy is a simplistic if not
childish view intended to cast democracy in the worst possible light
imaginable. What you describe is a democracy which has no bill of rights or
explicit limitations on the issues that the democratic body can vote on.
Obviously there is nothing in the definition of a democracy that prevents
those founding the democracy from stating:
"Congress shall make no law respecting ..."
or "The rights of the people to .... shall not be infringed."
Grow up.
You've proved nothing except your a priori dislike for democracy because you
want to convince others you are an angel.

No, I just hit a home run. The fact is that if the defendant is facing a
charge that can result in the death penalty *NO* juror will sit on that jury
who will a priori eliminate the death penalty as a potential verdict.

No, that is not the way it works at all. [Geesh]
Let's start from the beginning, shall we.
Our government does *NOT* start with the Constitution [one spin-doctor
approved lie down]. It starts with the Declaration of Independance. It
defines those self-evident issues of a democracy we are speaking of. Further,
the founding fathers [NOT just the framers of the Constitution; second
spin-doctor approved lie down] felt those rights were God given because they
were inherent in being a human being, not something like a drivers license
you had to prove you were responsible enough for and could be taken away
[third spin-doctor lie down]. You got those rights (barring social
institutions to the contrary, which are a challenge to overcome for
democracies - and we fail miserably) because you breath and shit - period.
[fourth spin-doctor lie down]
Even my being a pantheist, and hence rejecting the concept of divinity,
allow that we have rights which are inherent in our existance (Nature's God,
which for me are synonymous). Rights that can only be taken at the pain of
death or continued violence [fifth spin-doctor lie down]. That violence
abrogates the social contract between myself and others (ie society) because
it does not allow me the latitude that is mine by simple existance [sixth
spin-doctor lie down].
Allow me to quote the first and part of the second initial paragraphs of
that founding document:
When in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.      We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such Principles and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of Abuses and Ursurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. *THAT* is the definition of democracy, *NOT* some bullshit definition that a
government spin-doctor spews forth in a government spin-doctor institution
better known as a school telling you that some ephemeral 'rule-of-law' is
the ultimate authority in this country [seventh spin-doctor lie down].
Political oppressors are like the Terminator, you can't reason with them and
it will kill you. They're meat-bop (thanks Rudy!) machines with faulty
Democracies should be based on cooperation, NOT compromise (ie giving up
rights to make sombodies elses job easier). [eighth spin-doctor lie down]
Tim and others predict a revolution, while I agree in principal that a
social and political revolution and hence an accounting (hopefuly with about
another 50 amendments to the Constitution) is coming I disagree that it will
or needs to be violent. This ilk of 'patriot' hates so much they have become
what they hate - users of violence to get their way and to hell with the
consequences. They're simply the next wave of oppressors if we let them.

television you should spend more time reading books and period newspapers
and less time looking at the boob-tube. At the height of the range wars there
were only 9 murders associated with the conflict, not hundreds as the popular
entertainment media and spin-doctor culture would have you believe. Get your

Face off's at high-noon simply didn't happen and poeple didn't run around

I would suggest *strongly* that if nothing else you review the western
history series by Time*Life, should be at your local library, and UT Press
put out a book called "The Texas Rangers". I have both of them but
unfortunately they are in my shop 30 miles away. A lookup at your local
bookstore should get them if you are truly interested in how it was. "The
Quick & The Dead" was a movie, not a historical documentary.

Oh pooh. Spare us the spin doctor diatribe...
Anarchist are interested in protecting only their own person and
possessions over and above all other factors. Furthermore, it in no way
protects from oppression at the individual or social level. The only thing
it does is guarantee that I will have to spend a great deal of my income
on protection, most folks have something better to do with their time than
participate in a system that believes the height of personal achievment is
to sit around and stroke your gun looking for trespassers on their property.
Try explaining how an anarchy is going to better protect my right to free
speech or the economic and social stability required to carry on a business?
Democracy <> Mob Rule
Something you just don't seem to get.
A good measure of the oppressive level in a given government is to examine
who owns property versus who manages it.
Type:                            Owner:             Manager:
Communism                        Govt.              Govt.
Fascist                          Indiv.             Govt.
Democracy                        Indiv. <> Shared   Indiv. <> Shared
Anarchy                          N/A                N/A
Changes in this relationship seem to be a good measure. For example consider
the level of change in ownership rights before and after the changes in the
confiscation laws. If one thinks of speech as a commodity this also holds.

   NEW YORK (CNNfn) - H&R Block said Monday it will sell its 80 percent
   stake in CompuServe to WorldCom Inc. for about $1.2 billion in a
   complex deal which will ultimately turn over CompuServe's content and
   subscribers to America Online.
   [INLINE] Under the deal, CompuServe shareholders, including H&R Block,
   will receive 0.40625 shares of WorldCom stock for each share of
   CompuServe.
   [INLINE] After that deal is completed, WorldCom will turn around and
   give AOL all the CompuServe content assets and subscribers plus $175
   million in exchange for AOL's Advanced Networks and Services division,
   which supplies about one-third of the network capacity for AOL's own
   customers.
   [INLINE] The deal will add CompuServe's approximately 5 million home
   and business subscribers to AOL's pool of about 8 million customers.
   AOL is the world's largest online service provider.
   [INLINE] WorldCom, a business telecommunications company based in
   Jackson, Mississippi, will be adding AOL's high-speed Internet access
   division to its own services. WorldCom will retain CompuServe's
   Network Services division, which comprises about 100,000 ports used to
   support dial-up users as well as other corporate computer services,
   such as intranets.
   [INLINE] The deal ends AOL's long journey toward acquiring its online
   rival. America Online has made attempts to purchase the service as
   recently as July. AOL made a $1 billion stock bid over the summer,
   which H&R Block rejected.
   [INLINE] The deal will now face regulatory review and could possibly
   trigger concerns over AOL's largely increased market share. Link to

I can think of several ways right off...
 -  radioactive source  -  controlled water flow through a faucet
 -  waterwheel such that each bucket contains a hole of the correct size
 -  magnetic pendulum
 -  jello scintillation counter
 -  A-B chemical oscillators at their critical point
 -  a light detector placed under a tree in a breeze or wind
 -  Chaos Game
 -  Foucalt Dust
The real question is what algorithm is used to generate the random seeds.
The above mechanical systems (eg magnetic pendulum) are excellent sources of
random numbers whereas the algorithmic (eg Chaos Game) methods are more
suspect and open to breaking.
You might want to check out:
Fractals for the Classroom: Part 1; Introduction to Fractals and Chaos

I haven't looked at Part 2 yet so I don't have a clue as to its applicability.
But considering the authors reputations I would suspect it would be worth
a check out (I am planning on buying a copy anyway).

I think Igor got a bruised ego...
More explicity it is a weird IFS nomenclature (I believe). What is being
said here near as I can tell is:
Take some function X and takes it's output for the n'th result and use it as
the input for calculating n+1.
We take the n'th value and subtract it from 1, assuming the RNG function
returns 0 <= x <= 1, and feed this into X take the result and multiply by
some scalar, a, producing Xn+1.
Not shure exactly why the subtraction from unity is in there. All it really
does is give you a number > .5 if you are less than .5 and visa versa.
Doesn't enhance the IFS in any meaningful way that I can see.
The scalar multiplier, a, isn't doing anything but scaling the output.
Again it isn't effecting the IFS in a meaningful way that I can tell.
It would be more interesting to know the specific X's since this is
what will determine the 'level' of chaos that results since this is what
will define the strange attractor.
Section 1.3 onward of the reference I mentioned previously goes into some
detail on the various feedback processes and how to describe them somewhat
formaly. It's called a 'One Step Feedback Machine'.

I have read 'The Sovereign Individual' as well so am somewhat familiar with
the thesis they propose. I will ask you the same question I would ask of
Davidson & Rees-Mogg...
Assume that we accept this thesis that the best way to run a government is
to structure it such that customers set policies and procedures. What
inherent protections does that give me regarding abuse by the system? How
do you propose to keep the majority from deciding that it is uneconomical to
protect my rights as some minority group? A careful study of business
practices versus race or socio-economic group (as expressed by dress) will
quickly show that persons of the wrong 'type' receive less service than
those of more acceptable groups. The sort of service the customer receives
is after all in the hands of the salesperson, not the customer.
Let's look at an admittedly contrived example but I believe it will suffice.
There are two fires at opposite ends of the coverage area for a fire house.
On Saturday they receive a call to go to one end, where the wealthy live.
Would you have the owner pay prior to the firemen putting the fire out?
Would they pay some premium beforehand? Now on Sunday a fire occurs on the
other end where the poor are. Assuming they can't pay the bill would the
firemen drive away? If so, wouldn't this in fact pose a threat not only to
the other poor but also the wealthy since the fire might spread if it got
large enough. Would the wealthy then be asked to pay for that run of the
fire truck? What if they refused, how would the firemen pay for the food to
feed their family? Perhaps go out and burn down more rich houses...
If there are not some inherent or explicit checks in place then such a
econo-government would reduce to mob-rule just as happens with democracy
without explicit bills of rights. Neither you or Davidson/Rees-Mogg address
this issue sufficiently. Furthermore, neither you or the authors address
exactly why such a government would abandon the use of force totaly. Exactly
why would this form of government reduce say burglary, thereby eliminating
the need for police. Is this form of government going to do away with bomb
weilding weenies, I doubt it, so we clearly have a need for federal or
national level law enforcement fully armed. Since it is clear that all 200+
world governments would not abandon their current forms of government there
is a clear and present danger from outside our borders. How do we protect
ourselves from this threat? You can't pay them not to attack you, otherwise
you are doing exacly what the system was supposed to avoid doing - paying
You want a government with minimal intervention, the issue is not whether
it is a democracy or a econo-government or even a communism. What
measures that is the rights of the people recognized by the government
and how the government respects those rights.

The Sovereign Individual
Davidson & Rees-Mogg
ISBN 0-684-81007-7
re: pp. 207 - 208
Chapter 8
The End of Egalitarian Economics
The revolution in Earnings Capacity in a World Without Jobs
   Those who have employed compulsion and local advantage to redistribute
income are destined to lose much of their power. This will alter the command
of resources. Privately generated wealth that heretofore has been
commandeered by the nation-state will be retained instead by those who earn
it. Increasing amounts of wealth will find their way into the hands of the
ablest entrepeneurs and venture capitalist worldwide. Globalization, along
with other characteristics of the information economy, will tend to increase
the income earned by the most talented individuals in each field. Because
the marginal value generated by superlative performance will be so huge, the
distribution of earnings capacity throughout the entire global economy will
take much the shape it does now in the performance professions like
athletics and opera.
I don't know about you but I don't think the implicit assumption in the
title about our current economic system qualifying as egalitarian is in any
way realistic.
Furthermore, it is seriously expected that the majority of people will
survive by doing the equivalent of porno flicks to pay the bills while a
handfull of people wield all the money, and hence the power in this system.
Man, this sounds like zaibatsu heaven.
How exactly is it better to take all those resources away from a government
I have some control over irrespective of my socio-economic standing (further
protecting my minority status) and give them to a system which tells me a
priori that I have little hope of getting any realistic income increase
irrespective of my effort level.
While it will be true we will be living in a world without jobs it won't be
the socio-fantasy of Star Trek but rather the simple fact that there are no
jobs to be had. And to top it off, their going to tell me up front that I
have no hope of support if something happens and I can't pay the fee for
government intervention. We are further shocked to realize that the tried
and true philanthrope won't be around because those sorts of resource uses
are inefficient and will be quickly eradicated because of it.
A call to the gas company,
"I'm sorry Mr. Bilbo, we can't turn your service back on because of your
not paying bills. If you wouldn't buy quite so much soup to feed those bums
you might have the money to pay the bills."
Yeah, take everything I got, take everything the person who might be
motivated to help me has for trying to help me, and then tell me I don't have
anything that I can do about it...woo woo, sounds like fun to me.
It may come as a shock to you, but money is not the goal. The goal is your
grandkids and the world they will live in.
We pay taxes to pay the bills of the indigent not to let the mother sit
around on her ass but rather to protect the innocent kids who don't have a
say in it. Those kids deserve a chance, whether you as an individual believe
in them or not, THAT is the cost of humanity. We are just stewards of this
reality, the real owners are the generations to be born. Their the ones we
have to explain ourselves to. Please review Santyana.
While I strongly suggest reading the book because it has a lot of good
individual ideas, the work taken as a whole is seriously flawed.
Also, please remember;
You are
What you do
When it counts

Not in this democracy they don't. In every democracy currently extant there
is a bill of rights. The government may not respect it, but that is a flaw

See above.
Since there are no true democracies extant your point is moot.

First it isn't morality in the sense of personal decisions of right and
wrong but rather a question of professional ethics akin to a doctor or
engineer. It is basic questions about the limits and responsibilities
involved in specific activities.
Your 'free society' is a euphamism for anarchy. You are promoting a system
where all activity is voluntary.  In such a system nothing higher than
unshaven naked peole with a rock and the rabbit they just killed exists.
There is no motivation in such an environment to build higher
infrastructures because there is no mechanism to provide environmental
In such a system individuals don't have time to do anything but protect what
they have and take as much of their neighbors environ as possible. They
don't have time for anything else, if they go off and spend 8 hours building
that nice pretty public road for that new auto plant their neighbors take
what they have and tomorrow they discover they don't have time for that
public road after all. You might say, well let your wife and kids watch it.
To that I say, isn't that the same as letting elected officials build a
infrastructure - there is an implied taxation taking place. Furthermore you
have about the same amount of security in both systems - I doubt you would
be brash enough to propose that all husbands can trust all wives and kids.
Not if you are a citizen and abiding by the contractual agreement between
you and the n-1 citizens of your nation.

This is most certainly a democracy, it's called a representative democracy.
That we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights is a measure of the
founding fathers wisdom but by no means are either required to have a
democracy, nor do either by definition eliminate a governmental form from
being a democracy.
That depends on how the founders define the democracy. The definition of a
democracy does NOT define the system put in place merely who has a say in
how it runs.
You're painting with way too broad a brush. Like most things simply being a
cat does not equate all cats to be the same. This also applies to
democracies, there is plenty of room to manuever when designing it.
Where? When? No government ever implimented by man has ever been a true

For there to be a true democracy as you seem to define it we would require

Forwarded message:
If the Libertarians are so gung-ho on avoiding governmental (especialy
federal) intervention in their lives why do they support the 14th Amendment?
Why do they steadfastly stick to the position that the states should be
forced to be homogenous in their laws under the federal government? It is
clear that the founding fathers wanted the situation in the several states
to be quite dynamic and diverse, otherwise why "Congress shall make no
law..." and not something more comprehensive preventing the states from such
laws as well?
Why do they further not ask why the 9th and 10th are not fully respected and
used by both the legislative and judicial branches of the federal
No, the Libertarians have an agenda that is broader than simply reducing the
intervention of government in our daily lives. They want a situation that
provides them the upper hand, both politicaly and economicaly, while at the
same time reducing the ability of their opponents to gain an advantage. From
this perspective they are just another elephant or jackass...

   Reuters
   16-SEP-97
   CAMBRIDGE, England, Sept 16 (Reuter) - Privately held Harlequin Group
   Ltd said it introduced a software product which harnesses artificial
   intelligence to speed up criminal investigations.
   The product, Harlequin Intelligence, displays criminal investigation
   data in graphical form. Artificial intelligence is used to break down
   witness statements into their component form and instantly links
   evidence to existing databases.
   The graphic displays allow a quick snapshot of the progress of an
   investigation.
   In a statement released at the Cambridge International Symposium on
   Economic Crime, Harlequin said the system discovers links or
   identifies associations that may not be immediately apparent to an
   investigator or analyst.
   ``Harlequin Intelligence is designed for use by major law enforcement
   and investigation agencies to combat many different types of crime
   including homicide, fraud and drug related offences. It is also
   designed for use in commercial business information environments where
   these powerful technologies can be equally applied to corporate
   business concerns,'' the Cambridge based company said in a statement.
   A spokesman declined to reveal the cost of the system or the company's
   sales targets but said the system had already been sold to the Los
   Angeles Police Department, a force in Florida, the U.S. Federal Bureau
   of Investigation, and four police forces in Britain.

A democracy which doesn't respect its limits of power is the problem. This
has always been the problem with all forms of governments and will continue
to be the problem with all forms of government (even anarchy). People are
people, people are strange; it isn't a question of technology [1] or time.
The solution is people taking more direct and immediate action in the first
person. Always has been, always will be.
Irrespective of all the spin-doctor protestrations to the contrary not
Governments are governed by the 3 laws of thermodynamics just like
everything else.
You can't get ahead
You can't break even
You can't quit the game
The failing with the founding fathers is that there were not enough
amendments in the Bill of Rights explicity listing citizen rights and
federal duties and limits in the first place. THAT is the problem with
our government today: even the harshest critics of their day trusted a
federal government too much.

I think you are confusing 'blatant self-interest without regard to others'
with civil liberties. There are no 'gay rights' or 'womens rights' or any
other sort of 'minority' rights, there simply are rights that each and every
human being holds. All this special interest crap is just that, blatant
self-serving crap at the expense of others.
Civil liberties are inherent rights human beings have by simply being human
beings. They are not a statistical effect or dependant upon who happens to
hold the current reigns of government. Their respect however, does depend on
not only the minority but the majority realizing it is in their best
long-term interest to support them. The bottem line is that it really
doesn't matter what kind of government it is, as long as everyone goes along
reasonably willingly.
What truly amazes me is that, for example, the anti-gun lobbiest have not
pushed modifying the 2nd Amendment. Shows a serious lack of character and
follow-through. Oh yeah, that would get either the states or the people
directly involved...imagine that.
Seems to me that the best way to play poker with an equal player is to go
for table stakes. Perhaps the answer is a Crypto Amendment movement, take
the political ante all the way...why mess around with some pansy-waisted
politicians in Washington...lets get 50 governors or several hundred million
Americans involved. You'd at least get PSA's and 'equal time' out of the
deal. It'd probably cost less to influence 50 governors than several hundred
congress persons.

                TED TURNER DONATES $1 BILLION TO 'U.N. CAUSES'
     Ted Turner making his speech In this story:      * 'A billion's a good round number'      * 'You have to learn to give'
     * 'The world is awash in money'
     September 19, 1997
     Web posted at: 12:10 a.m. EST (0510 GMT)
     NEW YORK (CNN) -- CNN founder and Time Warner vice chairman Ted
     Turner announced Thursday night that he will donate $1 billion over
     the next decade to United Nations programs.
     Turner made the announcement at a dinner held in New York by the
     United Nations Association-USA to honor Turner for his contribution
     to the international community. He was presented the Global
     Leadership award by the group.
     Speaking of his gift, Turner said, "this is not going to go for
     administration. This is only going to go for programs, programs like
     refugees, cleaning up land mines, peacekeeping, UNICEF for the
     children, for diseases, and we're going to have a committee that
     will work with a committee of the U.N. The money can only go to U.N.
     causes."
     The donation will be made in 10 annual installments of $100 million
     in Time Warner stock, he said.
     "Present day value that's about $600,000," he joked.
     The 56-year-old Turner also joked that he was about to be named to
     Forbes magazine's list of the top 25 richest Americans, "and I'm
     going to push myself down the list."   'A billion's a good round number'
     During his speech at the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel, Turner
     said that he made the decision to donate the money only two nights
     ago. He said it was based on the increase in his net worth since the
     beginning of the year.

     Ted Turner's speech

     CNN's Larry King talks with Ted Turner about his donation.
       _______________________________________________________________
     "When I got my statement in January," he said, "I was worth $2.2
     billion. Then I got another statement in August that said I was
     worth $3.2 billion. So I figure its only nine months' earnings, who
     cares?"
     Speaking live later with CNN's Larry King, Turner said, "I'm no
     poorer than I was nine months ago, and the world is much better
     off."
     Asked how he came to pick the figure $1 billion, the irrepressible
     Turner said, "A billion's a good round number."
  From one station to a colossus
     Starting in 1970 with a single UHF television station in Atlanta,
     Turner grew a global colossus that includes a smorgasbord of cable
     channels, movie studios and professional sports teams. He started
     his TBS satellite superstation in 1976 and CNN in 1980.
     As a yachtsman, Turner was skipper of the boat that won the
     America's Cup in 1977.
     In April, Turner chided fellow billionaires Bill Gates and Warren
     Buffett for not donating more money to charity.
     "What good is wealth sitting in the bank?" Turner said at the annual
     meeting of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. "It's a pretty
     pathetic thing to do with your money."
     Turner said the gift was based on the money he'd made from the Time
     Warner stock he received when Turner Broadcasting merged with Time
     Warner to form the world's largest communications company (and CNN's
     parent company as well).
     He said the decision was to give the money based on the value of the
     stock, but that it is possible the stock will increase in value and
     "Who knows, I might get a little money back from this deal."   'You have to learn to give'
     Turner and Annan
     In 1996, Turner gave away $28 million, according to a survey by
     Fortune magazine. The money went to Worldwatch, the Bat Conservation
     Society, Friends of the Wild Swan and hundreds of other
     environmental causes.
     Turner told King that he has discovered "the more good I do, the
     more money has come in. You have to learn to give. You're not born
     to give. You're born selfish."
     Turner said he wanted to donate the money directly to the U.N. but
     was told by his lawyers that would not be legal. The U.N. cannot
     legally accept money from individuals, so Turner will create a
     foundation to spend the money and administer the programs.
     The programs are expected to focus on jobs, land mines, education
     and global warning. When King asked about global warming, Turner
     said, "Haven't you been outside lately? It's hotter than hell out
     there."
     Turner also said he intends to become a fund-raiser for United
     Nations causes "so everybody who is rich can expect a call."
     Alvaro de Soto, the U.N. assistant secretary general for political
     affairs from Peru, said Turner's gift "symbolizes the best of what
     we all admire in America. I can only hope that his gesture will
     inspire many."   'The world is awash in money'
     "There are so many rich guys in the world, billionaires," he said.
     "The world is awash in money and nobody knows what to do with it. We
     don't want the money they know what to do with, just the money they
     don't know what to do with."
     "Did you talk to Jane Fonda about this?" King said.
     "Yeah, two nights ago when I thought of it in a hotel room here in
     New York," Turner said.
     Asked her response, Turner was momentarily quiet. "It brought tears
     to her eyes," he said. "She said, 'I'm proud to be married to you.'"

Well it really wasn't meant to be taken quite that literaly. It just seemed
to me that a question of some import to this list might be how one tells
such a statistical anomaly (if you'll allow me) from an actual concerted
attack. What would the tale-tell's be for such a distinction? While
full-blown war would not be hard to differentiate consider such an attack
from a small group with an immediate and distinct goal as well as potential
long-range goals. What sorts of processes and types of information would be
of interest to a person who was tasked with evaluating such an occurance?
Things like:
 -    relationships between the history of the various participants, both
      mechanical and human
 -    geographic relationships, weather comparisons, environmental
      conditions, etc.
Consider your responce at first reading. That is a barrier that has to
be jumped for such activities to be used effectively, wouldn't you think?
This would indicate that an effective long-term strategy for a sect attack
via the Internet would be advertising. Which would rule-out most real
clandestine attacks as being from a small political or religous group. There
is also the issue of talent recruitement and budget. So, with these sorts of
issues in mind, what kinds of financial transactions might be of interest?
And finaly, in such an environment can the elimination of non-GAK crypto
really be effective? Is crypto really even an issue?
Now consider, if you will, the requirements if we assume that we are under a
concerted Pearl-Harbor attack from a rival 1st World power. How would that
effect the issues discussed above?

A pseudonym and an anonymous account are NOT the same thing. That is what
you are missing.
'ravage' is a 'nym that I have been using since about '82 or '83 (I used
'ogre' and 'ghost' before that), I have NEVER used an account such as
'anon while I do generate traffic under other short-term
The only reason anonymous mail comes as 'anon or 'nobody is because that
is the way they are currently set up. If an anon-remailer were serious about
long-term survival the output accounts would look just like the user
accounts and not something as blatent as the above.
Anonymous remailers will have arrived when they quit using the simple
patterning as above and they figure out how to charge for their services
(anonymous privacy is a commodity with a worth, seriously undervalued in
todays market).

This works if it happens to be in the current location of an individual,
seems pretty unworkable considering the geographic distribution of cpunks.
Provided you can pay the bill to keep it going AND you use some form of
anonymity (which I doubt you could hold up for long).

Just a quick note to say that SSZ is back after a 2 day downtime caused by
the phone company throwning my trunk onto another trunk because of a switch
in central office location (I'm closer to the new one). The only problem was
the ISDN wasn't listed in the to-throw list so that pair got pruned out.

@_subject: Remailer latency (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
Some basic issues regarding the physical infrastructure (YMMV):
 -  since the lines are answered by modem and not voice AND they are
    not answered as the business you can use residential lines which
    means a much lower cost of operation.
 -  assuming 1 in-dial and 1 out-dial (needed for maximum throughput
    and minimum latency) you only need long-distance on the dial-out.
 -  the pricing on the move of my 4 POTS broke down thus:
     Line #            Install $         Monthly $     Function
       1                 38.35            16.63        dial-in, no ld
       2                 30.95            16.63        dial-in, no ld
       3                 16.35            16.63        dial-in, no ld
       4                 16.35            30.08        voice w/ ld,
                                                       call notes,
                                                       caller id
 -  the pricing on my other aspects are:
     ISDN                0.00 w/ 2 yr.    80.00       main link to
                         contract                     provider
     Electrcity                           12.00       per machine
     Modem               200.00                       per line
     ISP                 0.00 w/ 2 yr.    400.00      backup DNS,
                         contract                     4-day mail cache,
                                                      admin account,
                                                      usenet server access,
                                                      full C-class,
                                                      backup dial-in,
                                                      their ISDN costs
 -  you should also arrange legal and financial support
Maybe that will give you a Ctl. Texas base-line for estimating what it would
take to do the job. I should have an estimate for T1 pricing and setups in a
couple of weeks, say something and I'll post the current status.

   Reuters
   26-SEP-97
   HAMBURG, Germany, Sept 26 (Reuter) - The German unit of the world's
   largest online service, America Online, said on Friday it planned to
   boost advertising revenues and that its parent company may begin
   including ads on private electronic mail.
   ``We are optimistic that we will make a leap forward with our
   advertising,'' said AOL Germany spokesman Ingo Reese in a telephone
   interview with Reuters.
   ``We waited until we reached the critical mass of 400,000 users,''
   Reese said. ``Now we are opening ourselves up to the advertising
   business.''
   He said the company expected robust growth from the new ad strategy
   and added AOL had considered several possibilities for increasing
   revenues including placing advertisements in the form of graphics on
   e-mail between users.
   ``That is one of the most attractive venues for the advertising
   industry,'' Reese said, adding that 40 percent of AOL customers in the
   U.S. use it because of its e-mail capability.
   Reese said AOL had received positive feedback from media that carry
   ads and ad agencies on a presentation tour through several German
   cities with its U.S. marketing manager Myer Berlow, which ended on
   Thursday.
   He said the U.S. parent company receives 16 percent of its $2 billion
   in annual turnover from ads.
   AOL does not have any plans for major print or television campaigns
   for the online service, Reese said.
   ``We want to build up our own advertising business first,'' he said.
   AOL in Germany is a joint venture of American Online and the media
   company Bertelsmann . It recently took over its rival CompuServe,
   which it says will make it one of the largest Internet service
   companies in the region.
   Reese said the company had not yet decided how the takeover would
   affect its marketing.

Forwarded message:
This aspect of traffic cover is more complex than it at first seems. Take
for example the second simplest model that I am aware of. For each email
that comes in n bogus emails go out with one remailed copy. So for each
email we receive we end up processing n+2 emails. Since to be useful n must
be reasonably larger than 2 to be effective we are left with a quandry. As
we process more traffic (ie become successful) we find our bandwidth need
growing at a linear rate of n, unfortunately the skills and resources to
support this increase also get larger as we become more successful.

But that is the exact point I'm making - it hasn't been tested. Before
anyone with a lick of sense is going to jump into the remailer business
big-time somebody is going to have to put their neck on the block and set
the liability standard.
I'll grant you mentioned digital postage. This simply is not robust enough
to handle the world of a commercial remailer operator. We'll just have to
agree to disagree here because the standard digital postage argument simply
doesn't sway me to support it.

   26-SEP-97
   SINGAPORE, 1997 SEP 26 (Newsbytes) -- By Kenneth Kway. When it comes
   to conducting monetary transactions on the Internet, the world can
   only move as fast as its financial institutions. Banks in particular
   have an important role to play in the acceptance of the Internet as a
   legitimate medium in which secure business transactions can be
   performed.
   But even banks in well-connected Singapore have been cautious in
   embracing the Internet for their business while being clearly
   interested in tapping in on an increasing number of Internet users in
   Singapore and the region. The Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) is
   one of the first to make Internet banking a reality.
   DBS hopes to revolutionize Singapore's local banking industry by
   giving customers the convenience of banking through the Internet at
   any time they choose and from anywhere they happen to be. "We expect
   other banks will soon be unveiling similar programs but we are the one
   of the first to bring this service to our customers," said Lau Chan
   Sin, DBS deputy president.
   "We want this project to contribute to the creation of an IT culture
   where customers can experience the ease and convenience of banking on
   the Web," said Lau.
   The trial involving a select group of DBS customers and staff will
   last until October, when the system will go live. They will have
   online access to detailed information regarding their results. Among
   other things, they will be able to obtain real time information about
   their accounts, track cheque status, transfer funds and effect payment
   of bills.
   "For now, it is unlikely that Internet banking will move into areas
   that are not already covered by phone banking," says Datapro analyst
   Lim Soo Ching. "As it is, banks are trying to work out a business
   proposition for phone banking. Online banking would face the same
   concerns."
   The bank's home page, users' first point of access, will deliver
   banking news to the customer. The bank has gone one step further and
   allowed users to customize the kind of news they want to receive. Each
   time they check the area on the DBS home page labelled "Your Personal
   News" they will be presented with the personalized bulletin that is
   relevant to their needs and banking habits.
   The bank has put in place a slew of industry standard security
   measures like firewalls and authentication services. These measures
   are supplemented by a proprietary security solution. The emphasis is
   on confidentiality of the transaction as much as protecting against
   unauthorized access.
   "Looking at the technology the bank has out in place, security is not
   a problem," says Lim. "Banking may be actually safer than phone
   banking, but the user perception is just the opposite." The bank
   stresses the importance of user cooperation to maintain a high level
   of security. "The customer has to work hand in hand with the security
   systems that the bank has put in place," said Mrs Elsie Foh, executive
   vice president of retail banking at DBS. "For instance they should
   remember to log off from the system once they have completed their
   banking session.
   The bank was not at liberty to reveal the equipment and software used
   in the project but it was disclosed that the entire setup cost S$2
   million. Aside from an initial sign-up fee, the bank intends to charge
   users a monthly fee for the program after the initial 6-month
   promotion period.
   DBS will add to the initial services offered through the Bank's
   Internet Banking service. "We met with great success bringing our
   customers the convenience of share application and COE (Certificate of
   Entitlement) bids through ATMs," said Foh. "Similarly, we intend to
   broaden the scope of our Internet services to include more diverse
   types of commercial applications."
   Investment related transactions, insurance purchase and third party
   funds transfer are just some of the areas being explored for future
   implementation. In this way, the banks hope to build greater value on
   the new service and attract a high user base. DBS expects 30 000
   customers in the first year of the system's operation and projects
   that the number will climb to 150000 in 3 years.
   "Culture will also make a difference," says Lim. "Asia tends to take
   longer than the West in the acceptance of new technology." He cites
   automated teller machines (ATMs) as one such example. "It will be some
   time before online banking becomes the norm."
   DBS is looking into providing all its users with personal financial
   manager software such as Intuit or Quicken. This would allow customers
   to better coordinate their personal finances with the bank. Such a
   package will most likely be customized to work with the bank's system.
   "The significance of this technology is that any computer in the world
   that can access the Internet is instantly a transaction terminal that
   can be used to do banking." said Lim.

                         'SPAM' SLAMMING GOES TO COURT
      Internet spam September 26, 1997
     Web posted at: 10:59 p.m. EDT (0259 GMT)
     DEARBORN, Michigan (CNN) -- One of the world's largest Internet
     service providers is squaring off against one of its largest
     purveyors of junk e-mail, known unaffectionately by netizens as
     "spam."
     Apex Global Internet Services, or AGIS, the third largest Internet
     service provider in the world, has dropped so-called "spammers" from
     its service, including the biggest spammer of them all, Cyber
     Promotions, owned by Sanford Wallace.
     Now, Cyber Promotions and Wallace are fighting back, having filed a
     lawsuit against AGIS alleging breach of contract.
     "I'm very proud of what I do, and I don't really think that spamming
     is bad or good," said Wallace. "I think it's just a way of doing
     business."
     Spam is the electronic equivalent of junk mail, unsolicited messages
     hawking all sorts of products and services.       AGIS officials say they were forced to take action because they were
     caught in the middle of the ongoing Internet tug-of-war between
     spammers and angry recipients who had launched high-tech
     counterattacks against spam.
     "We asked the anti-spammers to give us a chance, and we asked the
     spammers to stop sending unsolicited e-mail to people who said they
     didn't want it," said Phillip Lawlor, chief executive officer of
     AGIS. "The problem was that really didn't make anybody happy."
     "Both sides then resorted to unethical and illegal practices in
     order to take down the other side's networks."
     There is some precedent for AGIS's actions against junk e-mail.
     Earlier this year, America Online successfully sued to stop Cyber
     Promotions from sending unsolicited e-mail to its subscribers.
     However, AOL is a private network, not an Internet service provider.
     The suit between Wallace and AGIS, then, could help determine how
     far such providers can go in trying to can spam from the entire
     Internet.
     A federal judge is expected to rule on the suit against AGIS on
     Monday.

Forwarded message:
And consequences will be:
 -  in general intermittent reliability with boxes going up and down
    like yo-yo's. I suspect it will be like BBS's were in the early
    80's when everyone put one up for two weeks.
 -  limited traffic bandwidth, why would some kid or hobbyist be
    willing to spend (for example) $1k/month to keep a T1 going so
    others can use it.
 -  parties who would not use a fully commercial site because they
    don't want to pay for it will flock to such servers. Because
    they loose nothing if it goes down they have no reason to
    consider the impact of their actions on themselves.
And there are a couple of problems with this:
 -  it relies on a mechanism not currently in place to interface with
    other more traditional financial institutions. Which I might add
    don't look upon this as the most trustworthy mechanism.
 -  how do you charge for the postage, per submission? What happens when
    I want to send 10,000 parties the email. Do I still pay the digi-postage
    equivalent of $.35? Or do I pay $350.00? What about intermediate
    remailers and their desire to get a cut of the pie?
Really? Tell that to the DA when some bozo from the local Scientoligist shows
up and starts harrassing you with legal actions. No, CyberPromo is a clear
indication that what others think can in fact sink your boat no matter how
big a bilge pump you might have.
It must evolve or else we won't have anonymous remailers. People in general
are not going to build these sorts of systems out of some philanthropic
streak. Even if they did, it is equaly obvious they won't be reliable for
long-term use.
Agreed. However, I do not believe that anonymous remailers have a
sufficiently parallel structure with physical mail to carry that system
over. When the Austin Cpunks had kourier up about a year and a half ago
it became clear that financing such an enterprise is not trivial. I suspect
that anon remailers will operate by something similar to ISP's where when
the account is setup some fee is paid for use and not on a use by use based
fee. The problem with that is it creates a 'concrete' link between the
party desiring anonymity and the remailer operator that may be exploited in
some (most? all?) cases to break that anonymity.
The problem is that it shuts out people like one of my customers who still
uses a 2400 modem, even after I offer to give her a spare 14.4 that I have.
While I can appreciate the desire to expunge such luddite thinking as a
gear-head but as  a business I don't care about their philosophy unless it
leads me to their purse strings.
If remailers are going to work as a business we can't turn our back on
traditional payment mechanisms. The problem, as I see it, is that there is
no clear mechanism for me to write a normal check and have that turn
into a anon account easily without involving 3rd parties and their
concommittent extra costs - further increasing the end-user cost to do
business. There better be a reason or they won't pay for long.

In effect as you get more popular your traffic becomes easier to track.
I don't think I would use a remailer that advertised this 'feature'.
Traffic analysis is something that is easily automated so the measure of
success (to my mind anyway) is what sort of resources would a mallet need
to get a solution versus the time frame that solution might we relevant.
Admittedly this is a very sloppy area of remailers, I am not aware of any
analysis with anon. remailers in mind.

True, but there are only 3 systems and it is not clear at all which will
dominate and be used by all parties. Also there is the issue of security in
regards to maintaning anonymity when there is such a small pool of parties
to use. Doesn't take a genius to figure out where to hang out and watch the
How? There is certainly no clear mechanism in place. Does the customer
contact each remailer operator prior to sending the traffic, thus opening up
N opportunities for anonymity cracking.
If the operators agree to a system how do we get there? Is it time to have a
anon-remailer conference to settle on distributed payment schemes?
Unless it is pertty serious nobody is going to pay such a fee just to send
an email around. The problem I see is one of scale. The infrastructure for
handling physical mail is very 'bulky' and requires a lot infrastructure.
Email on the other hands effectively rides on the back of an existing
Internet infrastructure for nearly free. Because of the historicaly low cost
for email this would tend to in general indicate a low market value on anon
remailers. This means the cost per msg. must be very low (the aforementioned
micro payments) and hence leads to two realizations:
 -   we need a lot of remailers
 -   we need a lot of traffic to invoke economy of scales
It is clear that neither of these can exist without the other, meaning this
puts us at a chicken-or-the-egg type situation.
True, but it doesn't have the rest of the infrastructure (some detailed
above) in place. To get this to work will take more than a couple dozen
operators swapping some digi-cash between themselves. There are entirely too
many infrastructure and legal issues for remailers to be any sort of
profitable long-term business that will attract non-techie investors.
If you know of some investors please let them know of me as I am very interested in commercial remailers (anon & not).

It would provided nobody was really concerned about tracking you. Let's
consider your scenario for a moment ...
1.   purchase M.O. with cash, presumably in person
2.   use ground mail to get the M.O. to the remailer
3.   send encrypted email from your nym to me identifying which account
     it applies to.
4.   remailer receives the email and the M.O.
5.   apply funds to account.
I see a couple of ways a determined mallet could over time figure out who
was doing what with whom.
My primary assumption is that mallet has some reason to suspect a specific
party and their use of anon remailers.
When the M.O. is purchased, even by cash, the chances of getting put on
tape is pretty high. This places a clear link between at least one party and
the purchase of the M.O. (it has a serial  and the time it was purchased
(M.O.'s have time stamps). Making it trivial to figure out which
security tape(s) to review.
The ground mail places at least a rough geographic area as to its source
unless you plan on travelling all over the states sending your M.O.'s. This
is too much trouble for a user except in very unique circumstances. My
grandmother for example probably won't travel across town let alone across
the state on each use.
By monitoring the physical mail at the remailer we can clearly link the mail
to the recipient.
When the remailer deposits the M.O. a record is going to be made about who
received it and how much.
My guess is that it would take about 3-4 cycles of this before mallet can
start putting a clear picture together of what and who is involved.

Yes, but it does not have a clear market advantage. In fact the anonymity
issue may actualy work against it.
I can assure you that any business will not use multiple protocols unless
their interface is the same for all of them. There simply isn't enough
business to have very many systems.
Ask yourself this, how attractive would the Internet have been if it had
required users to install and manage multiple communications protocols for
every connection?
Different currenciens don't mean different payment systems. Even though we
have dollars, yen, rubels, etc. the things people do with them and the
way the systems are built are pretty much the same. This is why
international business works in the first place; they got banks, we got
banks. If I can buy a Quarter Pounder (Le Royale) in the US I figure I
can work it out in Russia.
But who is using the remailers is the point in traffic analysis if I'm
not mistaken. Not very anonymous if they know who you are.
Can do what? Anonymity cracking or create a payment system that allows
for the intermediate parties to be paid but doesn't over-burden the
user? The point is not to have the poor end user have to create a half-
dozen payment arrangements to get chaining. It becomes a real hassle to
do at that point. We're talking about the people that drive the one block
to the store to get more beer...
This is the silliest thing I think I have heard so far in this
A quarter a message per hop is about 2,000+ times too expensive to make
anonymous remailers work. The key to anonyous remailers is not the
cost per message but rather the amount of traffic to be carried.
Anonymous remailers are beasts of mass markets measured in millions of
And my experience is that prices move up and people expect them to.
But the system to post charges BETWEEN remailers must be pretty consistent
to be acceptable. That is the key and it has NOT been discussed too any
great degree. That inter-remailer traffic must be anonymous also or else
traffic analysis can back-track.
It seems to me that the remailers need some sort of anonymous payment
server that is put in place for some other reason, that way they don't
have to deal with the justification issue. The most obvious issue where
anonymous purchasing would be of interest to the regular consumer is to
prevent the collection of information about them through their purchases.
Perhaps what we need is a business which purchases things as an agent of
its members and then distributes them through some anonymous tracking
system. That way the only stats collected by retailers are those of the
aggregate purchasing requests. Then a member could request the purchase
of some credit line on a remailer. The remailers could become members of
such a system and purchase credit lines on each other to deal with chaining
payment issues.
What is being sold is anonymity. It does not necessarily provide
privacy and may in fact decrease your security.
How? What I am saying is that physical mail and the system developed for
dealing with it went hand-in-hand. The design and advancement of the
Internet technology is not driven by email or it's technology. That perhaps
because of this difference perhaps we need to look at models other than
the postage one. It in fact may be coloring our perception and a look at
alternative models might help.
The remailer itself is cheap, it's the rest of the system that needs working
Furthermore, most people who want privacy aren't going to be saying
anything anyway, anonymous or otherwise. The people who will use anonymous
remailers are people who have something to say but for one reason or another
don't wan't it tied to them personaly. It's not privacy but 'plausible
deniability' they are looking for.

That is exactly what we are talking about, he who predicts what the market
will do AND invests somebodies elses money will win big. That 'abstract'
market motion is EXACTLY what the market will do in practice. In other words
it's the service you will be buying because the people with the money think
it will make them money off your willingness to spend your money.
As I have said before, privacy and security are not issues in remailers.
Being able to plausibly deny any involvement is, a subtle but important
It will not start with a small group. Anonymous remailers are big traffic -
big buck operations in the long run. The price per message must be in the
milli-cent range which means the traffic must be in the mega-message range
to make money; simple multiplication.
It isn't a question of which currency you use - that is NOT the same as the
economic system in place. Businesses may use dollars or dinars but at the
end of the day they put them in a bank which at least at times follows
international agreements on banking. This is why we can transfer money from
one denomination to another.
Yes, but that is not a different system. You are still taking money from
your bank account (on loan from a bank if through a CC) and putting it in
somebody elses bank account. The banks define our system of economics to a
great degree. Banks don't like anonymous transactions so whatever system we
put in place must buy the support of the traditional financial institutions
at some point. How do you convince a bank that anonymous cash transactions
are in their best interest?
If they do then the users aren't anonymous anymore and hence any 'security'
or 'privacy' they may derive is one of delusion.
Stego won't be any harder to detect than a PGP encrypted message.
I guarantee that neither your mother or mine will look twice at that
gobbeldy-gook. Hell, I won't use it because I have to create such files
every damn time I have to send a message. Too much work, too much room for
errors. When you can arrange to chain remailers without the user having to
touch the above you will have a winner.
Actualy, yes I did do something to reveal my identity. I have to pass that
entire list of chaining along to the first remailer who passes it along to
the second minus the first entry and so on. If I can grab a single remailer
in that chain I can back track because that remailer knows where that list
came from.
To really make chaining secure neither the user or the individual operators
should have a say in it.
Then they won't use remailers at all. A smart person is not going to trust
any 3rd party channel they don't have total control over. A smart person is
not going to get involved in a conflict in the first place. The situation is
sort of like the comparison between reasonable and un-reasonable men.
Progress is caused by the un-reasonable man. If the commercial remailer is
ever going to arise (which I doubt) it will be one of 'regular joe's' as
users and must be about as complicated as getting a coke from a machine
(which is a long way off currently).
I am, that doesn't mean I can't call a spade a spade. I didn't say anything
about you personaly, deal with it.
Really? I suggest you look at newspapers from say the mid-60's and compare
them to now. Very few things will be anywhere close to where it was then in
price, and the vast majority will not be lower.
Bread went up, water went up, electricity went up, etc.
No, prices don't drop the machines that used to cost the current price
aren't made anymore. Any entry level machine costs about $1,000 just like
it did 10 years ago. The difference is that you get a lot more hardware
and a new os. Again, a minor but important distinction.
Yes, I have bought memory recently - 64M as a matter of fact. The memory has
dropped in price because the new machines don't take it anymore or else
the motherboards with the new many-megs-required OS's won't work on 8M
anymore. Theres no mystery other than obsolescence at play. Try buying one
of the new 4G DRAM's....
I looked into it for several months about a year and a half ago. The result
was the current economic, social, and legal environment simply aren't going
to support such operations in the near future with anything like the
indipendance that we would like.
Hell, your the one offering $50 or somesuch for a commercial remailer. Take
that $50 and set up your own site. Nothing like experience to teach a hard
lesson. If you're right you should be making money in short order.
While remailers may be, commercial remailers still don't exist and are a
completely different beast than some philanthropic enterprise. If you don't
get the millions up front you won't be getting anyone. The other aspect you
seem to ignore consistently is not the cost to submit the original message
but the cost to send that message to the world, the real cost I might add.
The purpose of commercial remailers (and I suspect all remailers) is to
reach a mass market. If your market can't reach millions for pennies nobody
will use it because you can't give them what they want.
Whether its drugs, sex information, or political views the central party
must reach a large group to succeed.
Once the pioneers worked out the technology: Cable television, music videos,
automobiles, air transport, bicycles, telephones.
Only if you feel obliged to arrange payment between the remailers yourself,
which provides a link between remailers and you further eroding your
expectation of anonymity. The point, which you miss, is that the chaining
remailers should know nothing of the original user which your system fails
to do.
ecash is anonymous but it is not an accepted standard between remailers, let
along commercial ones. Furthermore, under your system I as a user must
contact each remailer and arrange payment to some account. So we know not
only who received it but who sent it as well, otherwise how does the
remailer know to take your payment and apply it to your account and not
mine?. If we further accept your premise that mallet knows who is using those
remailers then we are completely devoid of anonymity.
I am arguing that under the current system the checks and balances are such
that true anonymity can't be attained on a scale that is commercialy
Really? How about explaining how I purchase a car or house anonymously with
ecash? I can't.
Also, you seem to have missed an important point. When we get a system where
anon remailers can survive we will have created an anonymous money laundry,
not something that a lot of people want or desire.
If this were true it would have already happend. The thousand or so people
on this list might be involved in the technology and its application, I
doubt that we will have any say in its eventual success.
First, you don't know what I think - ask questions don't make assumptions
(speaking of manners). Please keep your ad hominims at home.
What I am saying is that because the cost of individual mail is low I as a
commercial business trying to make a living off each of those emails can't
expect a lot from them, therefore I need a lot of them.
ecash is not what I am talking about here. Which by the way will take a lot
of work to get people to use it as ubiquitously as needed by a commercial
I am talking about the entire infrastructure that will be required to support
commercial remailers. What will be required is not clear to anyone involved
in the issues. I furthermore don't have any interest in religion (re
evangalism) but rather in running a business and making money. I don't want
to change your mind, I want you to spend your money with me (as an anon
remailer operator) with the security that no matter what you submit it can't
be traced back to you. Even your much vaunted ecash can't do that yet.

I have to disagree on the annual cost to run. Considering the load of
remailers a simple ISDN would be sufficient. With that instead of a T1 it
takes less than $1,000 a month to operate a machine full-time. Approximately
1/4 of your estimate. I agree further that remailers COULD make a profit
under current conditions IF the financial institutions accepted anonymous
transactions (let's not even get into the LEA's and tax agents) from both
source and destination; they don't. I personaly found the legal issues the
most daunting considering my income and cash reserves. It would not take
more than one or two nuisance suites to put a small operator out of the
game permanantly. One of the critical aspects of successful small business
operation is a stable financial environment, I don't think you can have that
visiting the lawyer every few weeks.
This is larger than my guess at a fair market per msg value. Considering
your price does your remailer get enough traffic to pay your $50k a year?
Of coure it should be transactional and the only way to get it going full
speed is to grab the casual user. Consider that an email is a transaction,
it isn't like a phone line that may actualy handle many users over a given
time. Email has one source and one to many destinations. The problem with
flat rate is it underestimates the impact of large remailings when the
population is itself millions. Furthermore, under a flat rate model each
remailer in the chain gets less if the number of remailers grows. This runs
contrary to what the user wants for anonymity retention which is a lot of
links in the chain. The user should be the one to decide how many and how
much that is worth to them.
It sounds to me like what you are saying is that since email (a one-time
event) is a service of the Internet, however the Internet (a long-term
structure of computers forming backbones with more transient leaf nodes) can
survive flat rate pricing because the limitations of a piece of hardware are
known and can be figured in. The number of users and the amount of remailing
can't necessarily be known before hand. Furthermore, assuming a commercial
model I would certainly have saturating my pipes a goal.
It further seems to me that to make that software simple and easy to use a
lot of 'decisions' have to be made for me. That indicates to me some sort of
standards and the implied organizations that set them for the remailers.
And contrary to what some would have you believe, those organizations and
standards do not necessarily imply great submissions on the part of the
participants indipendance. Consider the types of questions that needed to be
answered to get the CDR up and going. Such an organization would probably
suffice for the initial boot-strap.

Like a T1 doesn't require a POP. Like T1's and their associated CSU/DSU's
and such don't break (tell that to several of my customers who will get a
hearty chuckle out of that one). Like they don't need air-conditioning and
other support services.
True, but to be effective they must be available on demand and the user
shouldn't have to wait until your auto-dialer feels this is a good time to
deliver the service.
I have found that my 128k connection very seldom gets congested even with
high traffic. Other traffic choke points usualy limit the amount of
traffic that I see. Even when one of my customers runs their resume tracking
program (which will saturate a ethernet easily in testing) can seldom
saturate the line for more than a few seconds.
Ah, so cracker is not a true commercial model but rather a hybrid then?
You pay for some services and a 3rd party donates the rest?
I'm wondering about your co-location machine, from your comments above it
must be sitting in a field since you don't pay rent (or was that your way of
saying somebody else pays the rent for you?). Is this so? Since so many of
your utilities and physical plant are donated I have to question the
accuracy and utility of your figures as well as the applicability of those
figures to a true commercial enterprise.
Whether you have realized it or not, all those seemingly great freebies and
perks for nothing actualy make the remailer less stable because your
operation relies on the good feelings of a 3rd party which can be used to
Mallet's advantage.

This isn't strictly true. I can send an email from an anon account to my
friend Bob. At this point I know who I am, I know who Bob is, Bob knows who
Bob is, *but* Bob doesn't know who I am. Clearly I obtained anonymity
without anyone else gaining it. The only time that complete anonymity is
obtained is if both sender and recipient are using anon accounts.
Well a single user is going to make traffic analysis a bit simplistic.
Though this reducion to absurdity does serve to make a clear point about
anonymity and traffic level. Clearly large traffic flows are required to
maintane the anonymity for any usable length of time.
Only if the fee was something they would notice, milli-cent fees are not
something most people will notice. I think you are unwittingly getting near
the mark however. In short your comment about incentives to the operators,
include in there the users and you have a winning combination. The question
should be expanded thusly:
What would motivate an average consumer to use an anonymous remailer?
Clearly simple anonymity or writing nasty letters to Grandma anonymously are
not going to motivate most folks irrespective of cost - they simply have no
interest in such activities. So, the question becomes:
What besides raising hell anonymously, laundering money, and defeating
merchant purchase traffic analysis are commercial anonymous remailers good

Forwarded message:
Because if a remailer is working correctly for each incoming message n + 1
outgoing messages should be sent. Of those n + 1 messages, n are cover
traffic and 1 is the actual outgoing traffic. It is clear that n should be
larger than 1 to be effective. Therefore we know that at least half of the
traffic out of a given remailer is cover there simply to waste our cpu
cycles because the complexity of traffic analysis rises by the square of n
(I believe, working from memory here).
This raises an intersting point. How would a remailer system be set up to
handle encrypted email on both incoming and outgoing? In other words the
sender would contact the remailer with a key set and the remailer would then
send the results onward with individual recipients key sets. The only way I
could figure out to solve this in my playing around was to have a key server
that kept listings of all the parties keys. Is there a simpler way? I figure
the key server should not be the remailer machine.
Nobody expects to get rich but such an activity should at least be capable
of recompensing its owner and operators in an acceptable manner.
laundering cash, and avoiding credit analysis. But what?
No, at least not from my perspective. What we are asking is what we should
be using it for? I certainly have very little I would say anonymously. I
believe the best way to stay out of jail and reasonably secure is to be know
by large groups of people who might lend sympathetic ears in times of need.
I don't promote violence or unnecessary boat rocking, BUT (and it's a big
one for me) I do expect those who I charge with certain duties to carry
those duties out within the bounds of the contract we arranged. One aspect
of this is that if the charge is very controversial and you are known to be
vocal a gag order might be enforced. In such situations he who has already
had their say is much better off because then people realize the impact
clearly. Just consider the reaction to the Canadian criminal speech ban and
the resultant web activity for a real world example. With that kind of press
I can guarantee that the Canadians, even with their Draconian beliefs in
civil rights, are not going to use that sort of tactic widely. Now here is a
use for a  free anonymous remailer.
Yes, but why would I?

Using an anonymous remailer does nothing to reduce spam. It doesn't even
make it harder for them to send it to you, they just don't know who you are;
hardly a requirement for most spam that I have seen.
How in the world would an anonymous remailer help me get or keep a job?
Are you perhaps refering to whistleblowing? If so, being anonymous will do
nothing in most cases because you have to be willing to stand up and say you
saw what you saw non-anonamously in court. Otherwise the company will just
claim it ain't so and that you are some chicken-shit ex-employee with a
grudge, the DA will buy it too unless you reveal your identity which sort of
defeats the whole point of anonymity.
Now it might be useful for other forms of whistleblowing, ala Pentagon Papers,
where the source is irrelevant except for idle curiosity. But considering the
frequency at which this sort of stuff happens it hardly qualifies as a reason
to stay in business day after day. If it is a commercial remailer using ecash payments then every user is
laundering money - strictly speaking. The point being that with such a
system in place it becomes trivial to anonymously launder your money into
ecash and then using another account turn it back into real money. The nice
thing about this is that you don't loose anything in the process, unlike
regular underground money laundering where you might get 60% return (if you
are lucky and got a big gun). I'll leave it as an excercise to the reader as
to how this can be used to avoid taxes at nearly every level.

Well, speaking from more than a couple of years in the business, most
companies don't take that sort of traffic outside their corporate firewalls.
I can state unequivicaly, working for Tivoli - IBM, that were an employee to
send such confidential email out they would get sacked ASAP (as they should
be) and possibly face criminal and/or civil charges. Besides, it's much
safer to just bribe somebody, that way some eager beaver doesn't stumble
over your tap in a routine maintenance tour.
So you are proposing something like:
  employee emial --> anonymous remailer --> firewall --> Internet
  Intenet --> firewall --> anonymous remailer --> employee2 email
  employee email --> firewall --> anonymous remailer --> firewall
  firewall --> employee2 email
To be honest, I can't see either one providing any sort of security that
would be advantagous to a business. Not only that but in the second case
the remailer is owned/operated by a third party. How do I know my
competitors aren't running remailers to capture my traffic? The first case
would be much simpler if we simply do away with the remailers and simply
send encrypted email using company distributed software and keys.
You consider snail mail, phones, and faxes secure? You certainly live in a
different world than I do. I personaly consider none of them secure. Hell, I
have all the equipment I need to intercept any and all of these forms of
traffic in my workshop. For less than a thousand bucks you too can have the
necessary equipment.
Only if we use encryption and/or remailer technology. This crypto technology
is applicable to the other technologies besides email. Otherwise they are all
about equivalent without it, they keep the honest man honest and thats about

True, but you take a hit on security if you don't have a personal
arrangement with the provider. It also means you won't be on hand when
the cops come a knocking...better use CFS or something similar. This
will require having some sort of contact point for times when the system
gets rebooted, it's obvious you won't give the pass phrase to the operator.
There are other issues involved like the utility of having a business at home and the number of legitimate deductions that can be taken.

@_subject: Commercial remailer request... 
Since we apparently now have at least one commercial anonymous remailer I
would be interested in the gross cash flow. In short, I would like to know
the general difference (plus/minus and by about how much) between the cost
of the remailer operation versus the actual e-cash income in American dollars
each month. It would also be nice to know the relative ratio between free and for-pay submissions. Is the remailer to be advertised, and if so where?
Would it be possible to have such info say submitted to the list for the
next few months?
I want to put one up now that we are moving to a T1 within the next few
weeks but I have to justify it financialy.

@_subject: Electron Microscope... 
I have a couple of suggestions:
 -  Try several of the science museums around the country. As a result of
    my work with Discovery Hall I know that both Chicago and the
    Exploratorium in San Fran. had working available electron microscopes.
    Course this is nearly 10 years out of date too so who knows if they
    still run them.
 -  You might also try one of the 4 schools in the US who have a certified
    Semiconductor Technology program. There is one here in Austin, one in
    Phoenix (I believe), and one somewhere in Oregon. I don't remember where
    the fourth one is. Call Intel or AMD and ask their HR or PR people
    where the schools are, they'll know.
Good luck.

I've been doing it for many years. Don't have a checking account, don't own
a credit card. I do have a saving account with a local credit union and
go in every 3-4 days and withdraw what I need for the next 3-4 days. Pay
every bill in cash or money order. I'm not going into how I invest my
excess capital. If my employer needs me to travel I do it on their plastic.
The only irritating thing I find is that I can't walk into grocery stores any
more and get money orders larger than $700 and many won't do it for more than
$400. I have to pay my rent each month with a $400 and a $397 money order in
order to meet the $797 amound due because I'm too lazy to drive the extra
6-8 blocks to the one who will do the $700 money orders. Other than that I
don't have a problem at all.
I'm going to go tomorrow and buy a new laptop at around $1500. I intend on
paying with a wad of $100 bills. Bet you they don't look twice nor will they
ask for ID.
I've actualy never had a problem paying cash, never had anyone turn real
money down...

Wrong. I go in once a week and pull out money in a lump sum. I then budget
that money myself. The only thing they have is a sequence of deposits from
paychecks and withdrawals to cash.
I either take the fees in check and deposit them or else take 'in kind'
trade (eg I did a job if installing Win95 for a customer on some laptops
he'd bought via auction. There was a Tadpole 3XP Sparcbook on there. I took
it for my fee).

@_subject: VMM question - reply (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
This is a function of the "Look Aside Buffer" and the actual operation is a
bit more complicated. The vmm must keep up with which processes have it
mapped, where in their indipendant memory maps it shows up at, what the
status is in each of those maps, whether it's sharable or not (though the
Linux vmm doesn't seem to do any write locking), and probably some functions
that I've missed.
There are two ways to do this in general...
Write-through: means the vmm goes ahead and not only updates the vmm copy
               but the copy on the drive. Note that this may or may not
               actualy update other copies if a process has one that isn't
               sharable (ie has its own private copy). This has a lot of
               over-head in that there is lots of i/o.
Write-back: means that the data in the individual pages doesn't get written
            to the drive until the page is either swapped out of active
            memory (and written to swap) or is closed. This is a form of
            'lazy propogation'. Again, this doesn't address how other
            processes may have their images effected.
One easy way, at least on a Unix machine, is to keep the system clock setting
when the page is created. Then close them in chronological sequence. This
obviously has it's problems. The first person to open isn't guaranteed to be
the first person done. Another method would be to select via a PRNG the
'first' process to update the page. Then each following would take their
turn according to the spin of the wheel. This leaves us with two options,
as each process closes it only writes the changes that it has made; which
could overwrite the previous user if they edited the same part of the file.
The alternative would be to force each user to create a different file with
some filename convention to differentiate them. Then leave it up to some
unknown method to arbitrate the file propogations at that point by some
'compare and share' method perhaps.
How do you know ahead of a read that a process is going to read that page?
Or are you saying that before another process can open a file we force the
first process to go ahead and write its changes? What happens once two or
more have the page mapped and begin editing? How do you propose to manage
the file closure writes that will occur?

Forwarded message:
It turns out, I've been doing more reading on vmm on NT, that the model
that's implimented in NT is a hybrid of the MIPS 4000 model and the 386
model. That rationale is that this allows the actual code in the HAL to be
much smaller by taking advantage of the different hardware aspects of the
cpu architetures (this means speed).
Don't know if I am going to get this right since I still haven't figured out
all the intricacies. But this is what I *think* is going on (in NT)...
The TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) is used in NT to determine if the
page frame is currently in memory or swapped out. It does this by marking a
frame 'invalid' if it's swapped out and listing it's actual page frame
number if it's a valid page. Invalid does *not* mean that it can't still be
in memory. The reason is that each process has a 'Page Frame Directory' which
lists all the valid Page Table Pages for that process. Each of these Page
Table Pages lists where each Page Frame Page is within that processes memory
map (and that's a whole nother issue with various parts being pageable and
non-pageable as well as system or user level). Each Page Frame Page knowns
where the individual pages are (ie in memory or swapped out). There is a
rather tedious mechanism that translates the virtual addresses to PFD's,
PTP's, and finaly to PFP's. That's what I'm trying to get a handle on now.
Now these various page related structures get quite big and themselves need
to be swapped out. So there is a level of recursion in here. There is also a
Page Table Page structure called a 'Prototype PTE Address' (a PTE is a Page
Table Entry - ie a valid page frame, these things seem to have several
different names making it confusing to follow at times) which is used to
allow processes to share a PTE across PFD's. Once we get to a PTE we actualy
have a 4k chunk of code or data that a cpu can operate on/with.
So, there is where I'm at right now...
Hope that makes it clear as mud.
ps. I am enjoying my Toshiba 445CDX, it's a pretty cool machine. Anyone

     Saturday Sale will be going on. Anyone interested? It's basicaly
     about 20 sq. blocks of computer equipment of every make, model,
     and age imaginable as well as lots of other stuff (time before
     last some guy had Cobra Helicopter IR cameras for $500 ea., would
     make a great IR telescope.). We usualy leave Saturday morning around
     2am and get there a bit before 7am. The sale usualy starts about
     midnite Friday nite and goes until Saturday evening. The best deals
     are early Saturday morning (my experience over about 5 years of
     going anyway).

I'll provide you a feed if you find that acceptable, unfortunately I am not
able to provide an account on SSZ to run it off of. My suspicion is that
you'll need a majordomo or similar remailer package (possibly with procmail
for duplicate filtering). I also strongly suggest you get your feed as a CDR
member and not a subscriber to a given list. That way if one node goes down
it won't leave you out in the cold (necessarily). You also probably don't
want to use a system that hosts a CDR node in case that site drops off the
Good luck.

If there were no copyright nobody would have any reason to market software
or much else for that matter. I would predict that much of the technology
and infrastructure we have now wouldn't exist. It would also stiffle
creativity and new methodologies because there would be no profit in it to
recoup development costs. Those who would survive in such a market would be
the 800-lb gorillas because only they would have the resources to squash the
smaller companies.
Free markets monopolize.

Oh yeah...
Software development is a long way from selling software, not the same
animal at all.
I mean when I go down to the dozen computer stores within a mile or so of my
house I am truly deluged by software from countries outside of the US and
Canada. I mean we have all heard of the Indian and Bulgarian software
billionares haven't we? And all those folks in Turkey just rolling in
Further, who do the majority of these folks who actualy make a reasonable
living work for either directly or under contract? Large US and Eurpean
countries thats who.
That's why those folks can make a living developing (not selling) software.
I can tell how often you buy perfume, the ones I buy for my girlfriend
certainly have a little 'c' on them... And as to the number of companies
that are actualy developing perfume versus reselling it under their own
house brands...there might be a couple dozen succesful (say stay in business
more than 5 years) in the whole world and I would go so far as to hypothesize
that if one were motivated to plot the number of companies per year over the
last say 50 years you would see the number go *down*.

@_subject: Free-market monopolization features... 
This is the theory in its current working version:
An unregulated (free-market) economy will inherently monopolize when, but
not necessarily only if, the following are present:
 -  the market is saturated, in other words the number of consumers at
    any given time are equal to or less than the service providers ability
    to provide that service (or resource). This means the long-term survival
    of firms is a function of retained market share and raw resource share
    control/ownership.
 -  the technology and/or start-up costs are high in material and
    intellectual factors. This minimizes the potential for new providers
    to start up. Providers will also require non-disclosure and other
    mechanisms to reduce sharing of information and cross-communications
    except under controlled conditions. Expect an increase in certifications
    and implimentation standards required to do business with the more
    succesful of these providers.
 -  an individual or small group of service providers have a small but
    distinct efficiency advantage in technology, manufacturing, or
    marketing. Over a long-enough time this market advantage will grow
    and as a result widen the 'technology gap' between firms.
 -  expect the most efficient firms to share their profit with the
    critical intellectual contributors. This further reduces the
    problem of cross-communication and new provider start-up.
 -  expect to see the more successful providers to join in co-ops with
    the less succesful providers. This will be under the surreptitous
    goal of 'developing technology'. It's actual goal will be to cause
    these smaller firms to commit resources to such enterprises. As soon
    as it is strategicaly advantagous the primary providers will break-off
    the co-op. This has the effect of further reducing the ability of the
    smaller providers to react in a timely manner to market changes or
    develop new technology due to resource starvation.
 -  expect to see the less efficient providers to combine in an effort
    to reap the benefits of shared market share and resources. Unless
    this partnering provides a more efficient model and there is sufficient
    time for that efficiency to develop these new providers will eventualy
    fail or be joined with other providers.
 -  expect to see the primary provider buy those less efficient providers
    that don't fail completely. These purchases will be as a result of
    some new or unexpected technology that will significantly increase
    the market share of the primary provider -or- it will be with the
    goal of eliminating this secondary technology and forcing those
    market shares to do without or use the primary providers technology.

 -  initialy prices for services will be low to promote purchasing but
    as providers obtain larger market shares their prices will increase
    over time and out of step with inflation and other market forces in
    order to widen the profit gap. The strategy is one of 'use it or
    starve'.

So do I, and I bet both our incomes combined doesn't add up to 15 minutes of
Bill G's and it won't. From a market perspective we're flies on the back of
great elephant. Please be so kind as to describe how and why this marketing
mechanism (copyleft) will succed? I've been using and supporting Linux since
1993 (SSZ is listed as a source site in the back of 'Running Linux' since day one) in this manner neither I or anyone else has gotten rich. Linus made
so much money off it that he went to work for a company in So. Cali. writing
fully commercial software...  It's copyrighted in the important sense in that it uses the copyright to

made by it.

wouldn't be filled with short term conflicts and ups-n-downs. Only that the
*long-term* result is a monopolized market. A point you seem to gloss over
as irrelevant. Let's give the market another 5-10 years and see where Linux
stands. Right now the estimate is 6-10 million users world wide use it. Share
wise that isn't a lot. The reason that Linux garners so much press right now
is that it is in fact an exception when an organization uses the software
(eg NASA). The test will be whether it grows significantly over the long
run and not the 5 years that Linux has been a serious os.

Agreed, however the motivations that drive people to creative or
constructive acts wouldn't change.
Agreed, but the ability to carry through on them *is* criticaly dependant
upon the social and technological infrastructure of the participants. True, but what you are leaving out is their ability to impliment those
ideas, which most certainly depends upon the infrastructure that surrounds
them. Ideas abhor a vacuum. In such an environment it is reasonable to
assume that people would not loose their basic instincts, among them greed.
So it is clear that people would not stop having ideas, but the milieu of
those ideas would be restrictive and most probably very paranoid. If you
learned of a particular process or idea it would not be in your best
interest to pass it around. Further it would be very difficult to trust
others because there would be no consequence to them taking your idea and
using their resources (which the creator was depending on to actualize the
concepts) to create the end product themselves. Remember the prisoners
dilema here...
This is a straw man. We are discussing the issue of what would be reasonable
to expect considering human nature in an environment where there was *no*
protection of ideas and no redress of grievances through a legal system.
Intellectual anarchy if you will.

The point is that it would *not* effect single instances or markets, it
would effect the very fabric of trust that is inherent in a society that
rewards creativity. If there were no copyrights and by extension no
protection for the creator or implimentor of an idea we would have a
situation where the groups with the resources would be the ones able to best
actualize and therefore reap the benefits of ideas. In such an environment
why would some individual choose to go head to head in a battle they
couldn't win due to resources and a lack of a standard infrastructure?
They wouldn't, they'd go back home and grow food and mind their own
business. They wouldn't exchange ideas because it could be taken as a given
that mail and other forms of non-direct communications would be insecure.
not receive it and that some intermediary would in fact take possession of
that material and take advantage of it. So we can assume that people would
not work on colaborations bigger than their immediate neighborhood. Now it
is also clear that within that neighborhood some will have more resources to
actualize ideas in respect to many of those who actualy create the ideas.
In such an environment why would the individual increase this parties
resource share to their own detriment? They wouldn't.
The protection of ideas and the reaping of the actualization of the creation

mechanisms that impliment this fundamental belief of who should benefit. If
we do away with this we are also doing away with a much deeper and
fundamental aspect of modern society, trust that our toil will benefit us in
the end.

I agree.
Is it? The vast majority of those users are non-commercial users. The number
of US users, currently estimated at 6M is *not* significantly different than
the number of home users of C64's and Amiga's (both machines had a very poor
commercial market penetration) and also had maximum market penetrations in
the 6M range. This consistency would seem to indicate to me that there
is a significant overlap in the home users and the Linux community and that
this community stays reasonably stable as a constant percentage of total
population and not the software alone. The question at this point is how
will this number change over the next 2 years or so. If we don't see a
significant rise in this percentage then I would suspect Linux will never
succeed in making a serious bid for MS parity. It is still a rare thing for
an employer to provide Linux as a the default os on a new-hires pc. How many
companies do you know that when a person comes in and configures their pc it
contains Linux by default? Not many. Further that percentage is *not*
increasing at any sort of significant rates. I would prophecy that you will
have to wait a long(!) time before you can expect your local grocery store
(HEB here uses Win95 and various Unix'es for back-office and check-out) or
bank to be using it as a de facto standard.
Also, considering that the folks who are making money on Linux are the
distributors. How have they faired over the last 4-5 years? If you go to your
1st year Linux Journals (only 12/yr. and the Feb. 98 is  and compare it
to your current issue how do the number of distributors fair? It turns out
there are only a few major distirbutors (Red Hat, Slackware, InfoMagic,
Walnut Creek, SuSE) and some of the early distributors have seen a
significant decrease in their market share (eg Ygddrasil). So even in the
Linux community we have seen a *decrease* in the *commercial* enterprises
who have succeeded? Why? Because users like to have the same distribution as
their friends so that they have some hope of resolving their problems. So
what you see (and this is from my 4+ years working with Linux user groups)
is that the majority of members of a given user group will have only 1 or 2
distributions and unless you have one of those most of them will be very
hesitant to work on it because of the ignorance factor of the special
features and changes of each distribution. The local Austin Linux Group
(alg-l at lists.io.com) for example is moving currently from Red Hat to SuSE
because of the superior, and propietary - I would add, X-windows and RPM
modifications they have made.

Another Linux market observation that would indicate that the total impact
of Linux is going to be less than what we as Linux supporters would want
is the literature that has arisen about Linux. In particular the count of
monthly magazines. Linux has a roughly 6M user market penetration yet there
is only a single Linux specific magazine available. In the comparative
markets of C64 and Amiga there were several (eg Amiga World, Info, Compute!)
magazines. Even today there are at least 3 Amiga magazines on the market yet
that machine hasn't been actively manufactured in over 2 years. Why is the
Linux magazine market limited to The Linux Journal? And what does that mean
for the long term strength of the market (and by extension the hurdles other
OS's would face in the future)?

Outside of Linux applications? Very small. I have never worked for a company
nor dealt with a customer who as a matter of course used GNU software and was
in fact the accepted cannon of that companies computer use policies.
Students, individual hobbyist, and small companies (one of the reasons I
focus on SOHO in my consulting) are the marked exceptions. The reason these
folks can get away with it is their customers if they have any are concerned
about the end product and not the process. This isn't true of larger
companies who are as concerned with the process because of the impact of
budgets, quality control, purchasing, etc.
As I do, I have a ELC and a Tadpole 3XP that I use Linux on as well as
Solaris. I also have a IBM N40 RS/6000 laptop that I run AIX 3.x and PPC
Linux on. I've been waiting 2 years for the Linux68k to be ported to the

for the Tadpole on Linux SPARC has been in the wings about that long as well.
In the Austin area (1M pop.), I have yet to find a single other soul who as
a matter of course uses Linux on those platforms. At best I know of about a
dozen people who play with it and every case I am the one who got them the CD
and prompted their activity. My experience would indicate the interest and by
extension future is not there for these platforms except as a point of
esoteric interest. Believe me, I *wish* I had more people to talk to and work
with on these platforms. I can kill just about any discussion in a Linux
user group meeting by asking about SPARC or PPC versions, nobody
(figuratively) uses them and nobody is really interested in learning about I know of only a couple of articles in the Linux Journal that has even
discussed SPARC Linux (and that would indicate a lot of folks don't use it)
and have never seen a PPC article.
Very few. The total number of SPARC or PPC (not Mac mkLinux) is measured in
the 10's of thousands at best. Consider that out of all the Linux
distributors only a couple carry SPARC or PPC versions.

I have a question, after going to the GNU homepage ( I have not
been able to find out the numbers of how many if any corporate subscribers
and participants to the GNU Foundation. Is there anyone out there who might
have a pointer to this information, or better yet is an actual participant
in the GNU heirarchy and can discuss these and related issues?

The problem with this interpretation of the market is that AmigaWorld, Info,
Compute!, etc. didn't cover the hardware to that great a degree. What they
did do was discuss the programming and applications of those machines to
problem solving, education, programming, etc.
This point isn't the hardware and it isn't selling magazines on related os's
that can be applied to Linux because of its similarity. The issue *is*
increasing Linux' market share, magazines that discuss issue about AIX or
HP/UX that can be applied to Linux don't do that.

Here is what I am thinking...
 -  commercial success at larger commercial enterprises can be seen
    by looking at their gross orders of software. Consider that if a
    company decides they want to use Win95 and WinNT for their systems.
    Are they going to buy them one at a time? No, they are going to
    purchase either large quantities or site licenses.
 -  Since GPL doesn't really support site licenses in the normal sense
    they won't be there to look at. In other words the total number of
    site licenses from corporations for software is a measure of its
    penetration.
 -  Since GPL doesn't prohibit buying one copy and then making as many
    subsequent copies as you desire it is not likely that a given company
    is going to buy great quantities of GPL'ed software. What they'll do
    is have each department, through their own budget disbursement and
    orders, purchase such software as required. So we can expect to see
    one or more, but relatively few overall, purchases of software.
    Since this does not seem, to me anyway, to allow for a differentiation
    between one hacker purchasing the software in a comany or an entire
    department this also will not be a clear indication of penetration.
 -  Large companies faced with the above situations and having committed
    to the continued survival of those sources of software will want to
    create a situation where they minimize their need to keep re-ordering
    software as its needed (expensive in people and process time) the
    reasonable thing is to subscribe for annual terms or similar programs.
What I would like to know is what is the percentage of subscriptions by
companies in regards to the total number of subscriptions of GNU software.
I couldn't find any way to get this info on the  page. Since the
question is at what point is current penetration of Linux into commercial
entities as a standard business environment this seemed relevant.

My suggestion is not to alter the card such that a visual inspection would
show. In most states it's a felony to modify or alter a drivers license,
they are considered the property of the state and not yours personaly.
Next time a cop asks for ID and you hand him your d.l. you could be in for a
lot more than  couple hundred dollars and a ticket.
Anywhere from a few hundred bytes to a k. Depends on the bit density of the
tape. Go down to your local electronics or audio supply and get a polarized
loupe and count them.

Well I just looked at my Tx. d.l. to make shure my memory was correct. At
least on Texas d.l's the *only* way to get to the mag stripe is to break the
clear plastic laminating cover. And I assure you that if that cover is
broken or tampered with the officer will become much more suspicous. It has
this nifty little seal embossed all over the laminating cover on both sides.
So going down to the local laminating shop won't work either.
Proceed at your own risk, it's your neck after all.

The 'Currie Point' (the point a magnetic material looses its magnetic

melt at about 250 - 300.

I rather doubt that. I have had a Texas drivers license since I was 16, I'm
now 38. I have washed them innumerable times and I have never had the
lamination break or otherwise degrade. The lamination is quite heavy. I did
have one crack at the seam one time because of a bad lamination and was
specificaly instructed by the officer who wrote me a speeding ticket to get
it replaced. I did so immediately. The law here is that if the license is
damaged, you move, or otherwise make the information invalid you have 30
days to correct it. I suspect quite strongly that had I shown up at the court
house to pay that ticket with the same damaged license (required to be shown
at the time of payment) they would not have accepted the payment and might
have asked to to discuss the situation with one of the officers they so
thoughtfuly have placed about the room.
Texas takes counterfeiting of licenses quite seriously.
My suggestion would be don't try such juvenile tricks here, the DPS have
seen it before and won't be pleasant people to deal with unless you're
a juvenile.
I have a proposal. Lucky is supposed to be in Austin for the CFP conference.
If he is agreeable, he could ask to examine a Tx. d.l. We could leave it up
to his opinion as to whether these would be easy to alter.

Doesn't the FCC have to test the RF emissions of all laptops as well as
monitors for sale as Class A and Class B in the US? Shouldn't that material
be available? I searched the main site,  but didn't find
anything regarding this. I sent a request for instructions on how to obtain
the emissions test results on computer monitors and laptops for commercial
and non-commercial use, foia at fcc.gov.
If anyone actualy knows of the location I would be much obliged if you would
pass it along.

I disagree, it would give you a gross baseline on the total emissions
between monitors and laptops. That field strenght measurement would at least
allow you to calculate radiuses of equal strength to calculate approximately
how far the emissions are from each class of device for equal probabilities
of detection. One of the specific goals is to measure how effective the
device is at effecting other co-located devices (such as seeing ghost images
on other monitors or causing static in paging equipment).
I suspect one could do it with a spectrum analyzer or a grid dip meter.
We're not trying to bring the individual vertical retraces out of the
chaff...we're trying to calculate the total comparitive emission strengths.
If that isn't high enough then trying to get individual componants of that
field will be useless.

As to calculating a realistic estimate of range to intercept, I disagree
I am aware of how to do Tempest in practice as well as in theory.
The process goes something like this. The first target is the vertical
retrace. This signal is usualy the strongest because the voltage required
(and hence the dv/dt) is the largest to sling that e-beam from the lower
right to the upper left. It usualy resides in the 50-70Hz range. The next
target is the horizontal retrace. It slews the beam from the right edge of
the display to the left in order to start another trace. You can use this
signal to syn both the vertical retrace steps (in order to move the beam
down verticaly to start another trace) as well as the ramp that is required
to slew the beam across the screen to write the pixes. Once these 4 signals
are aquired and fed to the appropriate control terminals of a CRT you are
ready to begin decoding the actual trace data for each line of the display.
This is the hardest since the actual modulation of the e-beam is done via a
screen grid (who said tube theory was out of date?) and that signal is quite
small and generaly has a cardoid emission pattern aligned axialy along the
central axis of the CRT tube. So if given a choise you want your antenna to
be behind the viewer in line with the display.
It is of some import to note that larger displays are easier to aquire
usable signals from since the distances the e-beam is slewed and as a result
the control voltages are much larger.

Only of the individual pixel modulations. Go back and re-read my post you
missed a whole slew of implications. The vertical and horizontal positioning
is via the yoke not the screen grid. Electrostatic steering of an e-beam
is expensive and slow, you can't change the charge on the plates that fast.
In regards the data for the individual scan lines, where else are you going
to modulate that beam than a screen grid? This is a high-voltage low-current point. You can't drive the beam off the screen, the inside of the tube is
coated in a carbon based chemical called 'aquadag' that will short the beam
to ground and blow your flyback transformer in short order. Not to mention
that the inertia of the e-beam will be a bit of a hassle to deal with as
well. It won't move that fast.
The screen grid is where the dot clock goes to modulate the e-beam, or is
your claim we're going to modulate the filament directly? If so I would
suggest you re-take your electronics class and learn how to read a schematic
a tad better. A short trip to either your local library or electronics
repair business will pay off wonders. You're looking for a Sam's Photo-Facts
on the particular monitor you are examining. There is also the fact that the
dot clock itself is a low-voltage low-current device until it gets to the
tube drive electronics where it switches the high voltage drivers to the
If your getting your signal off the harmonics you're doing it the hard way.
Go back and re-read your texts on Fourier Transforms and then do a
power-spectrum analysis on the signals to the tube; what you will find is
that the primary frequencies get the majority of the signal (eg 1st harmonic
of a square wave (ie a dot clock) only gets, at best, 1/3 of the energy of
the primary).
In any case, it's the high voltage emissions of the tube drive electronics
that are detected, not the small 5V to 12V drive signals. The same is true
for LCD, Plasma, and other flat panel displays. You detect the high-voltage
emissions of the display drive electronics. Note that on active transistor
displays (where you don't have the high voltage bias as in a LCD) you don't
get these sorts of emission magnitudes and they are *much* harder to detect.
In addition in the active transistor displays the display drive electronics
should buffer the data and so, unlike a CRT, you don't have to send each
individual pixel every time. You can actualy send only the changes and
impliment those. Unless you're integrating the signals you receive your
Tempest display will be gibberish.
What? This is malarky. If the screen is black the filament emissions are
being blocked by the screen grid and the charge cloud gets shunted to ground
via the aquadag coating. This means there is no current, and as a
consequence no emitted rf field to monitor. And what keeps it from blowing
the flyback in this case is that the charge cloud acts as a capacitor
and limits the dv/dt to something that the flyback can deal with, it has to
leak past the screen grid.
You can also discern this using Tempest to monitor NTSC where the black
pulse is a negative going pulse at the end of the scanline waveform. It's
there so the receiver electronics can know when to turn the e-beam off so
you don't get those annoying retrace lines across your screen when it moved
back to the left and down one line. Since it's a negative going pulse with
respect to the vertical and horizontal retrace it's dv/dt is going in the
opposite direction. If you get a schematic find the horizontal retrace clock
and disable it and monitor the display.
This is just plain silly. The switching of the software is drowned in a sea
of such noise on the board. Anyone who claims they can pull a valid signal
off a cpu pcb at more than a few feet is a liar or else they have some
pretty remarkable extra-terrestrial technology. There are litteraly 10's of
thousands of state transitions all over the pcb that are going on in
parallel and the positive transition fields cancel the negative transition
fields so what you end up with is a hash of noise. 30 seconds of looking at
a spectrum analyzer will make this obvious.
In modern computers what drives the crt is the data residing in the video
frame buffer that drives the output electronics on the card and not the
data on the cpu pcb.
It can take as much as 20 minutes to drain a good high-voltage supply (read
the documents of all power supplies that operate above a couple hundred
volts, it should include the discharge time constant - you want to wait
through at least 3 of those). There is also the issue that a crt tube sitting
unconnected in the open dry air will develop enough of a charge to knock the
shit out of you if you're silly enough to grab the grounding connection on
the side with one hand and be grounded to earth with the other. So even if
the machine is turned off you get a continous charge build up on the tube
that gets drained through various resistors to ground. Unfortunately this
is a pretty incoherent signal and low power as well.
I routinely deal with voltages in the 1MV range and currents (usualy not at
those voltages) in the 100A range (I build 12 ft. Tesla Coils for grins and
giggles that throw discharges in the 8-12 ft. range). When you start talking
about voltages above a few hundred there isn't any such thing as 'off', only
a higher impedance path to ground and longer time constants.
NOTE: if you do decide to play in your monitor then make shure that one of
      your hands is in your back pocket at *ALL* times. Otherwise make shure
      there is somebody there to call 911 so they can haul your body off. If
      you don't the discharge leakage current through your heart *when* you
      make a mistake will cause it to go into ventricular fibrillation
      (v-fib). Unless you got a de-fibrillator handy your dead in about 3
      minutes.
If they get within a meter of my machine I seriously doubt they will be
using VanEck but rather rubber hose or eye ball monitoring...
We're talking real world here not some Tom Clancy novel.
True, but instead of being within a couple hundred feet (the average
succesful range for interception) you're now talking about 10's of feet.
At that range my dogs barking will let me know that Mallet is in the house.
Duh, can you say 'impedance'....go back and study your analog and rf
electronics. A monitors off impedance per line is somewhere in the 50 to 75
ohms range. The impedance of a wire hanging in the air is much higher and as
a consequence the current flow and as a result the emitted em field will be
much lower.
And this surprises you? A pc chassis, provided you put all the screws in it
and don't have lots of holes in it, is a Faraday Cage, it's the reason they
make them out of expensive metal and not cheaper plastic.
A very effective method to confuse Van Eck is to have several monitors
sitting next to each other with different displays. A more active display
is much more effective than one that is static (eg. such as a person typing
in an email to cypherpunks).
I strongly suggest the following reference:

That's good. The thought that given current technology a signal reception
van could pull one monitors display out of a building that could potentialy
have 1,000+ pc's (my last job had about 1500/floor and 3 floors) at a range
of say 200 ft. is truly incomprehensible. If it works that is a feat worth
many laurels.
You show up in my companies parking lot without my permission and start
snooping you'll be the one sitting in jail facing industrial espionage
charges. Any defence lawyer worth a damn would be able to blow this out of
the water, private citizens don't have the right to invade my privacy any
more than police without a warrant - and that take probable cause.
It's the monitors that need shielded, the computers already sit in a Faraday
cage. Simple copper screen glued to the inside of the monitor case with a
paper sheild and then grounded will resolve that problem. Be shure to put a
grounded screen on the front of the tube as well (similar to those radiation
shields that some companies make that don't work because they aren't
A simple Gunn Diode oscillator driving a broad-band 100W rf amplifier will
swamp any signal you could hope to catch. Cost, about $250 ea. With the
new low-power transmitter rulings there wouldn't be much anyone could do
about it either.
Gee, and to think that when I've done this sort of stuff I only used a
Commodore 1702 composite monitor and some rf amplifiers and filters...
Duh, silly me. Any claim that it can *only* be done with lots of money is
almost always wrong.

His original money was made by being the first company to sell a CP/M
compliant BASIC. It was very heavily pirated and Microsoft became a de facto
standard for S-100 using CP/M. Then because of Digital Research's failure to
treat IBM with respect he was selected as the supplier for their basic OS.
This decision was made because of his reputation with CP/M software. Because
of this connection Microsoft was in a position such that Gates couldn't help
but make money as long as IBM was selling pc's. And considering nobody ever
lost their job buying IBM it was a shoe in that IBM was going to sell
machines. His first versions of Windows didn't sell. He looked at what was
selling which was a GUI with more features and better looks. He hired the
right people to impliment those changes and wallah he had a winner. All
those pc's running his old os no longer had to go to Desqview and DR to get
a GUI that was acceptable to their users. From their they have used various
marketing and licensing tricks to increase his market share.
But a company doesn't make money from selling software to computer
manufacturers, they make money by having their software on pc's that the
users use.
And in the long run non-copyrighted software has a significant market
advantage. It's smaller, it is more stable, and people don't get as pissed
off when they want to make their backups.

That depends on what current and near-future medical technology can do
to extend the lifespan of humans. If your assumption is that most folks
younger than about 50 will be dead in 75 years I suspect that you're in for
a nasty surprise. The reason I posted those cc:'s regarding such research is
enough that current estimates of key strength based on human life times need
to be re-evaluated. It is my suspicion that within 10-15 years it will be
possible, as a matter of course in regards employer medical insurance, to
have ones biological clock reset such that the lifespan will be extended 3-4
times with the main limiting factor being cancers. Under those conditions
key strength lifetime computations need to be re-evaluated.

As long as there isn't a transformer in there. The impedance shift will

11MHz base frequency won't produce a clean ring at 125MHz or 210MHz, they're
not a whole number multiple of the base. How is this accounted for? What did
he calculate the Q at? At what range was he picking up these harmonics as
well as the base? The lower harmonic implies a 4MHz beat and the higher a
1MHz beat, how did he account for these signals? Personaly I would be more
inclined to suspect the information was riding on the beats. He didn't
happen to measure the frequencies to 3 decimal places did he? Since the
components are most likely 20%, 10% at best. This would indicate that his
base clock was slewing from around 10MHz to around 12MHz, this would explain
the 1MHz and 4MHz beats anyway; sub-harmonics due to excessive slew-rate.
If he was seeing ringing it had to be very low power because such off-integer
resonances only occur in low-Q tuned circuits and that implies a very quick
decay constant because the majority of energy is being dissipated in heat.
So, in effect, Van Eck is claiming that the propogation attenuation of the
125 and 210 harmonics is lower than for the fundamental frequencies in a
low-Q tuned circuit? Or is he claiming the emitted energy of the harmonics
was higher than the base drive signal?
As I alluded to with the comment I made about integrating the received
signals. The easiest way to do this sort of stuff with a small budget is
with a flying capacitor integrator.

In what context? The only place a super-het would buy you any selectivity,
and its tight bandwidth may actualy work against you, is in capturing the
data on each trace. The syn pulses aren't amplitude sensitive so much as
time ordered. If you can get a clear signal use that to fire a Schmitt
trigger and synthesize your sync pulses and ramps/stairstep generators from
that. Using a super-het for this is over-kill.
Doing a Fourier on the grass won't pull the signal out unless you've got an
integration function in there to filter the noise (ala flying cap filter).
If the signal is strong enough that a Fourier can be applied to it then the
signal is most likely strong enough to use directly. The data we're trying
to get out isn't that complicated; two sync pulses and the e-beam modulation
I would like to request that you provide a better description of the
equipment used at HIP for the demo. If the various descriptions of that are
accurate his signal detection range was around 50 - 100 ft. and he was using
specialy sized fonts (special in the context that you wouldn't use them for
a spreadsheet or document processing). Is this correct?

I read the paper when it came out, but that's been a while now..:)
Thanks for the reference, I'll take a look at it over the next few days.
I'll describe how it works in hardware and then how I've done it in
You have a bank of n capacitors that are hooked to a amplifier via a
mux. You use a counter that you start with some sort of trigger that
sequentialy connects each cap in turn to the amplifier. The charge and as
a consequence the voltage varies depending upon whether the new voltage is
higher or lower than the last sample. The assumption being that the signal
itself is time invariant and that the variations in signal strength are
noise and random in nature. After only 3-4 cycles through the cap bank you
begin to pull a workable signal out of the noise. The nice thing is that
this works for signals that are below the noise floor and buried in the
In a VanEck monitoring situation you'd need a bank of n capacitors where n
is the number of horizontal pixels. You will also need to array each bank
into a m row matrix where m is the number of scan lines. You can get around
some of the bulk by using a gyrator circuit to synthesize the capacitor and
some sample-and-holds to synthesize the array.
The advantage here over software is that this signal can be sampled as its
built in real-time (use instrumentation amps) unless you happen to have
dual-port ram in your computer (I've never had access to such hardware) and
fed to whatever equipment you want to process it.
You take a A/D converter and drive an array with it. You sync it the same
sort of way as the hardware methods above. Each element in the array
contains the current estimate for that particular sample of the total
waveform. Each time you come back to the same array element you compare the
last value to the new value. You take the value that is half-way between the
two and store that as the new array value for the next cycle. In short order
a signal comes out.
Either the hardware or software method will naturaly integrate the signal
within the sample window because of the capacitor effect. This compensates
for clock and signal jitter quite nicely.
This method will require a D/A conversion process if you want to feed it
to any external equipment. Though it should be perfect for Van Eck
monitoring. Simply use your video frame buffer as your sample storage array.

@_subject: Fourier & Signal Analysis... 
There is one final point I would like to make regarding at least one comment
on Fourier Analysis of signals in a noisy environment.
Fourier signal analysis is not good for this sort of stuff, what you want is
a function called a Laplace Transform.
Fourier is a method to take a complex signal and break it down into
component trigonometric functions (eg sin) such that we can apply filtering
and other frequency dependant operations to the signal to improve the
signals characteristic signature or operate on a particular component (ie a
component that is resonating with something and decreasing the s/n ratio -
ringing on a pulse edge for example).
If you want to find a signal in the noise you want to apply a Laplace. What
it does is convert the amplitude-time variant signal (ie f(t)) into a
power-frequency variant signal (ie f(s)). What this does is take, for example,
a sample of a signal and describe how that signals power is divided between
the various frequencies in that signal (eg McLauren Series). In most
applications the grass of the signal will be evenly distributed across the
s-mapping while the signal (at least its carrier component) itself will show
up as a spike of noticeable amplitude. The reason you do this in signal
analysis is because that transormation function will often be a simpler
equation to solve numericaly that actualy trying to deal with f(t).
So, if you want to find a signal in a complex environment use a Laplace
Transform, once you've found the signal and want to know about its
components use a Fourier Transform.
Good hunting!

@_subject: VanEck, Noise, & Palmtops... 
Palmtops are noisy, this is bad for Van Eck. Van Eck relies on the fact that
the device is emitting display signals significantly above the noise floor
or that there is a method to pull that signal out of the noise.
Considering the power draw of palmtops, while they are noisy they are also
very low power. My guestimate on emitted rf is in the micro-watt range. That
means for a succesful intercept the receiver would need to be in most
situation within feet of the device. It'd be much simpler to simply ask to
see the PDA because you were thinking of buying one than lugging all that
obvious equipment around...
If you want to defeat Van Eck you want either very quite or you want lots of
noise smoothly distributed across the rf spectrum.

cases that are available. They'll cook or chill your electronics and block
the emissions quite handily. Be shure to get a supply for the copper door
gaskets, they wear out under daily use about 3-4 times a year.

I have felt that way since the early 80's. The rate of technology
multiplication and some of the truly weird technologies that people said
wold never happen are happening. Don't forget the fact that their test beds were done with *standard* ink-jet
printers with a modified head assembly.
These are some of the exact same questions that I'm trying to add numbers to
myself... when we take the union of the computer, information processing,
networking, bio-engineering, transportation, etc. industries the various
predictions of Toffler and others seem woefuly short-sighted.

Stricly speaking I would agree, we are *past* the cusp and on the upward
rush of the technology curve.
Exactly! Only look at what people are actualy *doing* and not what they are
predicting. It's one of the reasons the vast majority of forwards in the
technology forum I send here are about things that have succeeded.
While the concept of a backyard fab has been pretty much blown out of the
water what *has* come around and *wasn't* predicted is the growth of
fab-less chip design companies. If you look at how these sorts of businesses
have grown since the late 80's onward it is astounding some of the custom
chips these firms are willing to design and get built through renting others
spare fab bandwidth.
SoS technology was always predicted to win the game *if* the issues of
thermal expansion between the Silicon and Sapphire could be resolved. Also,
just as with Josephson Junction devices, other methods to achieve the same
levels of predicted performance at less cost were devloped. There must be
technologies that fail for there to be technologies to win. Simply pointing
at the failed ones as an example of why it can't happen is a strategy that
is doomed. There will always be some turk who has the self-confidence to say
it can be done and then does it.
All of these technologies are out there. They haven't reached a point where
they're mature for a variety of reasons. Let's look at Terabyte storage for
a moment. Consider that the largest data bases on the planet are only a few
*hundred* Terebytes and of them there are only a few 10's of thousands.
Perhaps the reason the market hasn't taken off in this area is because the
market isn't large enough. Give it another 5-10 years so that computers have
become pervasive in schools, play, home, business, etc. (and no they are not
pervasive now) and the market forces to drive new material releases on CD
or other long-term media as the *primary* media (paper being so now) *and*
there becomes a market for the re-release of past books and material then
we'll begin to see a reason for each of us to be carrying around tera-bytes
of data.
Fuzzy logic and neural networks resolve your telephone switching issues,
are used to locate natural resources, filter intelligence data for threads,
etc. They're even used in coffee makers and micro-waves now.
e-beam addressed memory is a looser, and anyone with a clue back them would
have said so as well. Too power hungry, physicaly a bitch to haul around in
your shirt pocket, etc.
I *strongly* suggest folks follow the Quantum Coupled Architecture
developments over the next two years or so.
These are new technologies that are only a decade or two old. Consider
transisitors. The first FET transistor effects was discovered in the 30's
but it wasn't until the 50's that we actualy managed to build a working BJT
and several years after that till the FET based technology became feasible.
And there have been some interesting advances in these fields. DES being
cracked by a bio-logical computer a couple of years ago for example. The ARM
technology as well as the ability to not only understand but manipulate the
genetics and mechanics of nano-technology have only been around 5-10 years.
These are new technologies that are at the 'terrible-two's' stages of
development. It's clear they can do it, they just haven't figured out how.
And in the process they're rambling around the house opening every cubbard
and drawer dumping the contents out.
Until it's a reality it's *always* hype. Asking the technology to prove it
itself the first day is like asking a new born baby to talk or recite
Shakespeare. It's unreasonably demanding and self-deluding.
You can see some pretty funny predictions in the Enquirer also...
It's a good thing to have an open mind, just not so open it sloshes out on
the ground.
a born cynic.
The street finds its own uses for technology.

@_subject: Moore's Law - What is it? 
Consider this,
Moore's Law has for the past few decades successfuly described the increase
in computer performance, at least within experimental error. It has proven
it's success, at least short term, from the school of hard knocks.
But what *is* Moore's Law? It clearly doesn't discuss the fundamental
technology of computing and its limitations. Is it in fact the mathematical
description of our understanding and ability to apply that comprehension to
the real world. Is it in fact a mathematical model of the limits of human
reasoning and not computing technology per se.
If Moore's Law is fundamentaly valid over the long-term it should be
applicable to other forms of human endeavor since the limits of human
reasoning and comprehension would seem to be a characteristic of our mind
and not a particular area of application.
What other forms of human exploration when examined in this light follow the
Perhaps Moore's Law is a measure of an ecomomic systems' ability to apply
and distribute technology to the society in a non-breakthrough, an ah-hah
experience where there is a fundamental shift of paradigm, environment.
If so, what other forms of economic expansion follow this curve?
However, if Moore's Law is only applicable to computing technology; Why?
Why should such a simple curve describe such a complex and inherently
non-deterministic area?

Perhaps, but I doubt your proposing that history looks upon Hamilton
with equity to Jefferson. The ultimate winner of any discourse is the one
that history remembers.
Jefferson's Opinion of Hamilton:
That I have utterly in my private conversations disapproved of the system of
the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, I acknowledge and avow;
and this was not a merely speculative difference. His system flowed from
principles adverse to liberty and was calculated to undermine and demolish
the republic, by creating an influence of his department over members of the
Legislature. I saw this influence actually produced, and its first fruits to
be the establishment of the greatest outlines of his project by the votes of
the very persons who, having swallowed his bait, were laying themselves out
to profit by his plans; and that had these persons withdrawn as those
interested in a question ever should, the vote of the disinterested majority
was clearly the reverse of what they made it. These were no longer then the
votes of the representatives of the people, but of deserters from the right
and interests of the people.
My objection to the Constitution was that it wanted a bill of rights
securing freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom from standing
armies, trial by jury, and a constant Habeas Corpus act. Colonel Hamilton's
was that it wanted a king and a house of lords. The sense of America has
approved my objection and added the bill of rights, not the king and lords.
I also thought a longer term of service, nsusceptible of renewal would have
made a President more independant. My country has thought otherwise, and I
have aquiesced implicity. He wishes the general government should have power
to make laws binding the States in all cases whatever. Our country has
thought otherwise. Has he aquiesced?
Note: It is of some interest to note the capitalization in the final
      opinion, it is Jeffersons.

This only applies to semiconductor systems. Also, liquid Nitrogen is cheaper
to purchase than beer, liter for liter. Also with Peltier devices it is quite
possible to keep such systems working for extended periods of time. Simply
review some of the Nitrogen based IR viewing systems that are being used by
amatuer astronomers.
However, there are technologies being worked on now, protein memory for
example, that offer equal 3d packing factors and don't require esoteric
cooling systems.

Hi all,
Someone mentioned in private mail that 'opticom.com' was a valid webpage.
True, but it isn't the Opticom that is making the tera-byte chips that we
have been discussing. I did a whois on them and called the admin contact
number and they very quickly made it clear there was no connection.
So, if anyone knows how to get in touch with the company on the other side
of the big pond please pass that info along to me. I am most interested in
getting data sheets, etc. on the devices.

The point I was thinking of was that such a timing would be when the country
as a whole was distracted with over-seas events. Since they were Aryan
Nation related, as I understand it, the goal was probably to further their
white supremacy agenda. An attack on some 'hood would cause a civil uproar
between blacks and whites that could have a impact of some importance. The
result of that could be quite pervasive.

I suspect that this part is the key, what they will propose is some
mechanism to alter the chipsets from the one currently implimented. Expect
them to impliment something similar to the DAT tape systems where the machine
won't execute a copy function if it sees the correct signal.

Their story was that the child had a behavioral problem and the parents
refused to get counceling when the school requested. She apparently goes on
room smashing temper tantrums on a regular basis. The father of the child
said it was the most ludicrous thing he had ever heard of, reportedly.
Can't say that changes the situation a heck of a lot though...

True, but the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents aren't equivalent. In neither
case were the people involved committing aggregious crimes nor were they
expecting to be attacked by massed forces.
I suspect that implicit with the premeditated train robbery is the
expectation of pursuit.
I don't remember the date, but....
During the American Civil War, Lincoln and his wife were having dinner with
several other government and military persons. During the dinner a
discussion arose about the best way to end the war. After much discussion
and depracation of the South Lincoln spoke. The gist of his rebuttal was
that the *best* way to win a war was to make the enemy your friend.

Forwarded message:
Apparently the girls problems had been going on for a while, if the reports
are accurate. Which raises the question of why she was still in a regular
school environment in the first place. If it was a 'all of a sudden' attack
then perhaps the instructor needs some looking into as well.
I'd like to know what the 'significant blood loss' from scratches was
refering to, as well as what experience the teacher had with the child prior
to this.

@_subject: Should the Feds ban spam? (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
It means the employee's of the paper act as agents of the owners and not as
direct right-holders of the paper itself. In other word the job of the
editor, not his civil right as an owner, is what gives them the privilige at
the behest of the owners to edit what appears in the paper.
The only people who have a right to 'freedom of the press' are the people
who *own* the press. Employees don't have rights, per se, in this only
duties and responsibilities to carry out the desires of the owners.
Now if we address the issue, as some proposed, of ISP's having 'global
filtering' rules (eg "All cyberpromo.com accounts are filtered") *and* the
purchaser may for some reason *want* to recieve cyberpromo.com traffic they
are left with the only option of going to a second (or third, or ...) ISP
in order to get what they want.
Not at all, I assume that people can deal with as many ISP's as they have
money for. What I do assume is that if we expect ISP's to filter spam they
have only a single option open to them. That option is to impliment a
filtering policy based upon an interview and oversight by the purchasers of
that account. This will increase the costs of Internet access far above the
current levels. This increase in cost will naturaly strain already limited
budgets and force some people to drop secondary (or tertiary, or ...)
accounts because of this basic access price increase.
Not at all, the purchaser defines a spam policy that the ISP impliments.
Whatever filtering the recipient wants to do over and above this is left
unremarked. However, for an ISP to filter ones email to determine if it fits
the policy the purchaser/recipient has defined they *will* be required to
review *all* incoming mail. Otherwise how do they determine if it fits one
of the categories that were defined in the contract, whether we look at it
from the perspective of what to filter or what to pass along and let the
customer process on their own.

@_subject: W.F. Friedman - A reputation revisited?... 
Thought I would pass an interesting quote along regarding Friedman. I think
it may have some interest considering the holding of Friedman by some
Combined Fleet Decoded: The secret history of American intelligence and the
                        Japanese navy in WWII
John Prados
ISBN 0-679-43701-0
pp. 164
"This is not to say the solution occurred in a vacuum, however. It was
OP-20-G that had solved Red, predecessor to the new diplomatic system,
and Commander Safford recognized that his organization needed outside help
on Purple. He went to his Army counterpart, The Signal Intelligence Service
(SIS), which formed part of the Signal Corps: there, senior cryptanalyst
William F. Friedman, was an expert on machine based encipherment systems.
Under Friedman, chief of the team attacking the B Machine would be Frank B.
Rowlett. Other SIS cryptanalysts, an electronics engineer, accounting
machine experts, and Japanese linguist formed the rest of the group.
Friedman, too often given credit as the man who "broke" Purple, made only
sporadic contributions amid other duties. His main role came in selecting
members of Rowlett's team, with an assist on diagnosis and analysis of the
sytsem. Robert O. Ferner was Rowlett's second, with cryptanalysts Genevieve
Grotjan, Albert W. Small, and Samuel S. Snyder plus crytographic specialists
Glenn S. Landig, Kenneth D. Miller, and Cyrus C. Sturgis Jr. The top
Japanese linguist was John B. Hurt, a Virginian like Rowlett himself."

This is the real fault with the conference mentality...
How can anyone reasonably expect 35 people, invitation only or not, to have
a clue about any aspect of the industry let alone some sort of birds eye
I would wager that if we took the top 35 ISP's in the US they couldn't come
up with a cohesive expression of viewpoint that would have a lifetime
measured in anything more than a few weeks.
Pure hubris.

The way it works is if a company send you (ie addressed to you or your
physical address) and *then* attempts to recoup costs for the product or item
delivered *and* you did not request the item *then* it is yours. It must be
either addressed to you or the occupant of that delivery address, it is
important to note that the test in all this is whether you requested
something from the company. If the item is specificaly addressed to a 3rd
party it is a crime to open it. I haven't looked into what the requirements
for re-delivery are, as far as I am aware you could either return it to the
post office for dead-letter filing or dump it in the trash.
Technicaly, it is a crime for *you* to put stuff in your mailbox. When the
home pick-up was eliminated a few years ago (supposedly because of the drug
and bomb threat) the mailbox on your house or in your apartment was turned
into an *exclusive* delivery point for the USPS. When you or I ask somebody
to drop it in the box because we are not home we are technicaly committing a

Not quite. Of course I don't agree with all of them either. There are two
rules you should consider:
 -  It's ok to have an open mind, just don't let it slosh out on the
    ground.
 -  Understanding a view is not equivalent to supporting a view.
You might also want to consider that two opposing views might very well
*both* be right...it depends on where you sit on the fence as to what the
tree looks like.
I must agree here. If a technologist (ie one who studies science for
profit, hence creating a technology) chooses not to publish their results
that is fine. However, a scientist is one who studies nature and its
interactions, profit is not and should not be a motive. Simplistic or not;
in fact some things are better understood when simplified (ala the
scientific principle). A scientist has an obligation to discuss and publish
their results for other scientists (and even technologist) when they are
reasonably sure their results will stand up to indipendant verification (a
critical issue in science, not in technology however).
Don't be confused by Timy's claim to be a scientist, he is a technologist at
heart. Many of his views and beliefs are motivated by issues of control *not*
Further, the *reason* he was so secretive was because of the history of
failed attempts and early 'proofs' that later failed. He was motivated by
getting it right and ruining his reputation; not because he thought proving
Fermat's Last Theorem would provide him riches and laurels for the remainder
of his mortal coil.
Which means, per the Constitution, that he should be removed from office.
He broke a public trust and that means he looses any public station he
currently has and is barred from future office.
Of course, this is a specious argument. If it was already in the literature
it wouldn't be science advancing (learning something that wasn't known
before). The whole point to science is to understand and explain what we see
and don't see that creates the cosmos we inhabit. Now if your point is that
Intel taking some trade secret only they are aware of and using this to make
quicker chips is science then you don't know a damn thing about science.
It is *required* for doing 'science', it isn't for doing 'technology'. As a
matter of fact a little perusal of history demonstrates that science
requires open and unhindered dialog while technology requires closed
channels of communcication and mechanisms of control. A perfect current
example is the move to cloan humans. The guy, Creed?, is right "you can't
stop science"; you can however stop technology and businesses do every day.
Until that oocyte goes viable it's science, from that point on it's
You don't know Timmy very well do you...
Actualy your mistake is assuming that there is *one* morality. Don't fret
though. Just about everyone wants to jam everyone else into their nice
little easily understood molds. It makes it much easier to justify their
actions to themselves and potentialy to others if they get them to swallow
even once.
Reasonable men don't change the world. If we aren't motivated by our ethics
and belief that our actions can change the world into the way it 'should be'
then what is the motive? Money? Even that is a veiled mechanism to make the
world the way we think it should be (ie we have more money or social station
than currently endowed with). Changing the world is what *makes* life worth
living. The question *is* why do you want to change the world and *who* gets
to profit by it?

True, Gauss didn't publish many of his results and he wasn't famed for that
either. He *was* famed because he *did* publish some of his works. In fact,
if you study Gauss you find a insecure introvert who in general hated his
competition. He lied in his correspondance about work he supposedly did (see
his relations with Bolyai who was a friend of his from school -
"Non-euclidean Geometry" by Roberto Bonola; Dover ISBN 0-486-60027-0 $5.50).
Yes, Gauss was respected for his math, he was hated for his humanity, or
lack thereof. If anything Gauss' bahaviour held back science because of his
Fermat in general published most of his work, however, much of it was lost
including his proof. His statement was that it was too long to be written in
the margin of the book, not that he didn't write it down. The implication
being that he *had* written it down and it got misplaced or lost it.
Both of these folks are *very* poor examples of your point.
Darwin set on his results because he was aware of the results of his work
and the consequence to his career. He felt he needed more stature and as a
consequence more security before publishing. He also understood he was right
and that the first to publish would go down in history and the second would
be an also ran. If you study the others alive at the time there were many
people who had suggested similar theories. His own uncle had written similar
material several decades before Darwin ever set foot on the Beagle. Darwin
didn't invent evolution, he did refine it. Further, Darwin *isn't* know in
the scientific community for his two books intended for lay readers. He *is*
known for his seminal study of finches and mollusks, both quite clearly
demonstrate his beliefs and theories and both had a much bigger impact on
the scientific acceptance of evolution than 'Species' ever hoped to have.
You are confusing the acceptance by the lay public as equivalent to
scientific acceptance. You really should read Mayr.
Again, a bad example.
Actualy the open discussion of hypothesis and the testing thereof in open
and unbiased comparison by indipendant researchers *is* most certainly a
requirement in science - your protest not withstanding.
Don't confuse the science of atomic physics with the engineering of building
a bomb. They are not the same thing. The majority of the work done to
succesfuly understand an atomic bomb was known world wide in the 1920's
and early '30's. The engineering to do it along with the money and project
management skills motivated by the political where with all to actualy do it
You are confusing affect and effect.
Thanks. My smashed finger is starting to hurt and your points are pretty easy
to refute as well.

That depends on your personal philosophy, or are you claiming to have found
"The Way"? (that's rhetorical, please don't respond since the consequencial
discussion leads nowhere that we aren't already)
You got to choose your family and what country you were born in and how much
money you have? Cool, you should consider yourself truly blessed, in the
several 10's of thousands of years of humanity you are the first so gifted.
No, everyone doesn't pick what they are comfortable with. Only somebody that
takes their station in life with its consimmitent spoils as a given would
say something this idiotic. Nobody is obliged to let you alone unless they
decide to of their own volition. It only takes one to make war (the old
saying is wrong) it takes two to make peace. And man being what he is wants
his own way even at the expense of somebody elses way. Such is the trials
and tribulations of social animals.

Unfortunately, for you, I never made that claim (if anything you did

Certainly not directly, but considering your background and past comments it

Um, actualy Einstein didn't propose a bomb. I believe Leo Szilard approached
Einstein with a letter asking the President to begin an initiative. The
motivation was because most of the really worthwhile German physicists
working on the Nazi programs left the Nazi sphere. The fear was that since
Germany had the *only* supply of heavy water in the world and the only state
backed program in the field that if the US didn't do something they would
loose the bomb in a series of bright flashes. I also, don't believe the
war had actualy started when Einstein was approaced by Leo on Aug. 2, 1939.
He certainly went to great pains to publish it, even anonymously in some
cases and out of his own pocket.
He pursued knowledge for deep religous reasons, according to his notes.
Newton was also the Exchequer of England and had 3 peopled hanged for
stealing gold from the government mint. He took the job because he had pissed
so many people off at the time because of his attitude that he couldn't find
work. It was prior to him becoming know as the 'Lion of England' and gaining
life tenure.

Who also worked with Gauss and probably beat Gauss to any solution to the
problem of non-euclidean geometry (see Kurzer Grundriss eines Versuchs, p. 46).
Actualy his father published it as an afterthought to get him to quit
working on Euclids Parallels. It was published in Tomus Secundus (1833,
pp. 265 - 322) written by his father.
Both John Bolyai's "The Science of Absolute Space" and Nicholas
Lobachevski's "The Theory of Parallels" are included in Roberto Bonola's
"Non-euclidean Geometry" (Dover, ISBN 0-486-60027-0 $5.50). I certainly had
no problem reading the 3 combined books.
I was just looking at the translators notes to Lobachevski, it was done
by George Bruce Halsted of 2407 San Marcos St, Austin, Tx. May 1, 1891.
Not true, Bolyai wrote him several letters as described in his book and the
various prefaces. Lobachevski's book was promoted by Gauss as the first and
truely critical work on non-euclidean geometry. In a rare show of magnamity
Gauss even admits that Lobachevski's work exceeded his own.
He wrote a classic work on non-euclidean geometry that was quite popular in
1912 when it was printed.

Would you or Keynes like to explain how such an aloof character could have
had so many 'well-known' conflicts without publishing and discussing his and
others work? How can somebody who supposedly never published have become so
well know? I guess he got somebody else to stand in for him in the various
discourses he partook of at the Royal Society meetings.
I would suggest a simple trip to the library and look at what is published
by Newton. If I get the chance I'll take a look and catalog some of the
anonymous publishing that are attributed to him. It may take a while, this
unfortunately can't reside very high on my list of priorities; sorry.
Would you or Keynes like to explain exactly how a government employee,
,as the Exchequer or as a Professor of Natural Philosophy (Physics)
would remain solitary? I guess Newton went to the various mints (if memory
serves at the time there were 3) and did his other duties including
presenting cases in court related to theft and counterfeiting by proxy?
Yeah, Halley had just seen the comet and was trying to figure out it's
orbit. He approached many people on the issue and Newton was the only one
who could resolve the issue in England. Because of the long periodicity and
the fact that Halley didn't have 3 sightings he couldn't use the standard
orbit calculations. By using calculus, which Newton had invented and Halley
didn't know, it was possible to calculate an envelope of orbits. Haley then
researched records of sightings and determined that only one comet with a
75+ year orbit could be it. If Newton was so unknown from not publishing why
did Halley even care to ask Newton?
Halley was a pretty notable character in his own right. He was given a ship
to do the first magnetic map of the N. Atlantic, he called it 'Paramour
Pink' (Pink Lover). He and the prince of Russia would also push themselves
around London in a wheelbarrow drunk as skunks...

Anyone who would tell their dying wife, via their son, to wait a moment

What the hell are you talking about here? I made no such claims at all.
Lobashevski was the first person to write in modern history on non-euclidean
geometry. Gauss was a contemporary and was quite familiar with Lobashevski's
work. He was even asked to review "The Theory of Parallels". Gauss, in an
uncharacteristic act, even admitted that Lobachevski's work had progressed
farther than his own.
Gauss did a lot of harm as well. He characteristicaly denied works of others
and trivialized their contributions while at the same time promoting his
own. He was prone to bouts of drunken anger and is known to have physicaly
attacked quite a few people while in that state. His usual treatment of
contemporaries was based on contempt, not respect.
Bolyai's father worked with Gauss (as I explained) and his son John also
worked with Gauss from the time he (Bolyai) was in school; not Gauss.
I am going to refrain from going on with the remainder of your 'points'.
You have strayed so far afield, as usual, or misconstrued comments that it
has no relevance to what the original discussion was about, which was science
advances when people publish and share their work - not when it is held back
and unpublished.

Ok, my absolutely last post on this issue.
Forwarded message:
It is a commen citation in several of his biographies. The first place I saw
it was in a science history book that Isaac Asimov wrote (you know who he is
I assume, known for writing world-class sci-fi and one of the best
bio-chemistry textbooks around in the 70's and early 80's) back in the late
70's. It's the same book where he talks about Torricelli (he invented the
mercurey barometer) and how he sent his brother-in-law into the bandit
infested hills to actualy test the device. There seems to have been some
indication that Torricelli had an alterior motive in this action.
Unfortunately I think I have attempted to read a large fraction of the 300+
books that Asimov wrote at one time or another since about 1965 when I really
started to read sci-fi and as a result they all seem to run together. I
looked in the couple of Asimov books that I actualy own but unfortunately it
isn't in either of them. I will look at the library I keep at the shop next time I go out there but it is equaly likely it was destroyed in my house fire
3+ years ago. If somebody out there knows which book this is I would appreciate
the citation. I will add this to my 'hunt-list' that I keep as I tour the many
bookstores here in Austin. If I find it I'll holler.
No, I am citing the translator of Bolyai's book; Dr. George Bruce Halsted.
If you want to discuss this further and intelligently it might do you well to
have actualy read the book, which by your own admission you never have.
Don't be a miser, spend the $6.00 US.
I *might* take your comments a hell of a lot more seriously if just once you
would cite a single reference to *any* of your comments or claims. It is
interesting that when it comes down to proof you don't have the time to do
the research nor do you *ever* fill any request for references.
Your twisting words and dangerously approaching straight out lying. Both
Farkas Bolyai and Gauss worked together on non-euclidian geometry. Let me
quote the translators notes for the book:
" But to prove Euclid's system, we must show that a triangle's angle-sum is
exactly a straight angle, which nothing human can ever do.
  However, this is anticipating, for in 1799 it seems that the mind of the
elder Bolyai, Bolyai Farkas, was in precisely the same state as that of his
friend Gauss. Both were intensely trying to prove what now we know is
indemonstable. ..."
As to my making mistakes, big fucking deal. Everyone does. The difference
between you and me is that I am not trying to do anything other than figure
out what happened and why. If I'm wrong I'll admit it (and I am at least
once a day). I am also willing to do the research (as best I can with what
resources I have) and also willing to cite it. All I ask from those who wish
to debate issues with me is equal treatment, in short the opportunity to
review their sources and an honest opportunity to refute those sources. You
seem to have a personal motive in everything you submit and further *never*
cite any sort of source that can be reviewed and repudiated or supported.
To put it bluntly, you lack honesty in your dealings with others.

the US somebody asked him what he would have been if he hadn't taken up
physics. His reply was a plumber. He was promptly made an honorary member of

Easily. The acceptance of freedom of speech is not equivalent to the
acceptance to spend and earn money freely and without regulation.
Speech and money are *not* equivalent.
This is as specious as Vulis' argument that these positions are equivalent
to pregnancy in the logical realm, in short you are or aren't. The reality
is that few people, other than statists or extremists look at the world let
alone their personal beliefs in that simplistic fashion.
I believe in the unregulated exercise of speech, including the dissemination
and use of crypto technology. To do otherwise implies some sort of ownership
of the individual by the society doing the regulating. Clearly an incorrect
conclusion. The ability of those same groups to spend their money as they
see fit is not supportable by that same logic. Groups must have regulated
monetary systems or else they collapse because of the monopolization and
therefore loss of vitality of markets. To believe otherwise is to accept the
premise that these monopolies could somehow buy an individuals rights.
Clearly a result even a market anarchist can't accept.

     Carl Friedrich Gauss worked in a wide variety of fields in both
     mathematics and physics incuding number theory, analysis,
     differential geometry, geodesy, magnetism, astronomy and optics. His
     work has had an immense influence in many areas.
   At the age of seven, Carl Friedrich started elementary school, and his
   potential was noticed almost immediately. His teacher, B�ttner, and
   his assistant, Martin Bartels, were amazed when Gauss summed the
   integers from 1 to 100 instantly by spotting that the sum was 50 pairs
   of numbers each pair summing to 101.
   In 1788 Gauss began his education at the Gymnasium with the help of
   B�ttner and Bartels, where he learnt High German and Latin. After
   receiving a stipend from the Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb�ttel, Gauss
   entered Brunswick Collegium Carolinum in 1792. At the academy Gauss
   independently discovered Bode's law, the binomial theorem and the
   arithmetic- geometric mean, as well as the law of quadratic
   reciprocity and the prime number theorem.
   In 1795 Gauss left Brunswick to study at G�ttingen University. Gauss's
   teacher there was Kaestner, whom Gauss often ridiculed. His only known
   friend amongst the students was Farkas Bolyai. They met in 1799 and
   corresponded with each other for many years.
   Gauss left G�ttingen in 1798 without a diploma, but by this time he
   had made one of his most important discoveries - the construction of a
   regular 17-gon by ruler and compasses This was the most major advance
   in this field since the time of Greek mathematics and was published as
   Section VII of Gauss's famous work, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae .
   Gauss returned to Brunswick where he received a degree in 1799. After
   the Duke of Brunswick had agreed to continue Gauss's stipend, he
   requested that Gauss submit a doctoral dissertation to the University
   of Helmstedt. He already knew Pfaff, who was chosen to be his advisor.
   Gauss's dissertation was a discussion of the fundamental theorem of
   algebra.
   With his stipend to support him, Gauss did not need to find a job so
   devoted himself to research. He published the book Disquisitiones
   Arithmeticae in the summer of 1801. There were seven sections, all but
   the last section, referred to above, being devoted to number theory.
   In June 1801, Zach, an astronomer whom Gauss had come to know two or
   three years previously, published the orbital positions of Ceres, a
   new "small planet" which was discovered by G Piazzi, an Italian
   astronomer on 1 January, 1801. Unfortunately, Piazzi had only been
   able to observe 9 degrees of its orbit before it disappeared behind
   the Sun. Zach published several predictions of its position, including
   one by Gauss which differed greatly from the others. When Ceres was
   rediscovered by Zach on 7 December 1801 it was almost exactly where
   Gauss had predicted. Although he did not disclose his methods at the
   time, Gauss had used his least squares approximation method.
   In June 1802 Gauss visited Olbers who had discovered Pallas in March
   of that year and Gauss investigated its orbit. Olbers requested that
   Gauss be made director of the proposed new observatory in G�ttingen,
   but no action was taken. Gauss began corresponding with Bessel, whom
   he did not meet until 1825, and with Sophie Germain.
   Gauss married Johanna Ostoff on 9 October, 1805. Despite having a
   happy personal life for the first time, his benefactor, the Duke of
   Brunswick, was killed fighting for the Prussian army. In 1807 Gauss
   left Brunswick to take up the position of director of the G�ttingen
   observatory.
   Gauss arrived in G�ttingen in late 1807. In 1808 his father died, and
   a year later Gauss's wife Johanna died after giving birth to their
   second son, who was to die soon after her. Gauss was shattered and
   wrote to Olbers asking him give him a home for a few weeks,
     to gather new strength in the arms of your friendship - strength for
     a life which is only valuable because it belongs to my three small
     children.
   Gauss was married for a second time the next year, to Minna the best
   friend of Johanna, and although they had three children, this marriage
   seemed to be one of convenience for Gauss.
   Gauss's work never seemed to suffer from his personal tragedy. He
   published his second book, Theoria motus corporum coelestium in
   sectionibus conicis Solem ambientium, in 1809, a major two volume
   treatise on the motion of celestial bodies. In the first volume he
   discussed differential equations, conic sections and elliptic orbits,
   while in the second volume, the main part of the work, he showed how
   to estimate and then to refine the estimation of a planet's orbit.
   Gauss's contributions to theoretical astronomy stopped after 1817,
   although he went on making observations until the age of 70.
   Much of Gauss's time was spent on a new observatory, completed in
   1816, but he still found the time to work on other subjects. His
   publications during this time include Disquisitiones generales circa
   seriem infinitam , a rigorous treatment of series and an introduction
   of the hypergeometric function, Methodus nova integralium valores per
   approximationem inveniendi , a practical essay on approximate
   integration, Bestimmung der Genauigkeit der Beobachtungen , a
   discussion of statistical estimators, and Theoria attractionis
   corporum sphaeroidicorum ellipticorum homogeneorum methodus nova
   tractata . The latter work was inspired by geodesic problems and was
   principally concerned with potential theory. In fact, Gauss found
   himself more and more interested in geodesy in the 1820's.
   Gauss had been asked in 1818 to carry out a geodesic survey of the
   state of Hanover to link up with the existing Danish grid. Gauss was
   pleased to accept and took personal charge of the survey, making
   measurements during the day and reducing them at night, using his
   extraordinary mental capacity for calculations. He regularly wrote to
   Schumacher, Olbers and Bessel, reporting on his progress and
   discussing problems.
   Because of the survey, Gauss invented the heliotrope which worked by
   reflecting the Sun's rays using a design of mirrors and a small
   telescope. However, inaccurate base lines were used for the survey and
   an unsatisfactory network of triangles. Gauss often wondered if he
   would have been better advised to have pursued some other occupation
   but he published over 70 papers between 1820 and 1830.
   In 1822 Gauss won the Copenhagen University Prize with Theoria
   attractionis... together with the idea of mapping one surface onto
   another so that the two are similar in their smallest parts . This
   paper was published in 1825 and led to the much later publication of
   Untersuchungen �ber Gegenst�nde der H�heren Geod�sie (1843 and 1846).
   The paper Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis
   obnoxiae (1823), with its supplement (1828), was devoted to
   mathematical statistics, in particular to the least squares method.
   From the early 1800's Gauss had an interest in the question of the
   possible existence of a non-Euclidean geometry. He discussed this
   topic at length with Farkas Bolyai and in his correspondence with
   Gerling and Schumacher. In a book review in 1816 he discussed proofs
   which deduced the axiom of parallels from the other Euclidean axioms,
   suggesting that he believed in the existence of non-Euclidean
   geometry, although he was rather vague. Gauss confided in Schumacher,
   telling him that he believed his reputation would suffer if he
   admitted in public that he believed in the existence of such a
   geometry.
   In 1831 Farkas Bolyai sent to Gauss his son J�nos Bolyai's work on the
   subject. Gauss replied
     to praise it would mean to praise myself .
   Again, a decade later, when he was informed of Lobachevsky's work on
   the subject, he praised its "genuinely geometric" character, while in
   a letter to Schumacher in 1846, states that he
     had the same convictions for 54 years
   indicating that he had known of the existence of a non-Euclidean
   geometry since he was 15 years of age (this seems unlikely).
   Gauss had a major interest in differential geometry, and published
   many papers on the subject. Disquisitiones generales circa superficies
   curva (1828) was his most renowned work in this field. In fact, this
   paper rose from his geodesic interests, but it contained such
   geometrical ideas as Gaussian curvature. The paper also includes
   Gauss's famous theorema egregrium:
     If an area in E ^3 can be developed (i.e. mapped isometrically) into
     another area of E ^3 , the values of the Gaussian curvatures are
     identical in corresponding points.
   The period 1817-1832 was a particularly distressing time for Gauss. He
   took in his sick mother in 1817, who stayed until her death in 1839,
   while he was arguing with his wife and her family about whether they
   should go to Berlin. He had been offered a position at Berlin
   University and Minna and her family were keen to move there. Gauss,
   however, never liked change and decided to stay in G�ttingen. In 1831
   Gauss's second wife died after a long illness.
   In 1831, Wilhelm Weber arrived in G�ttingen as physics professor
   filling Tobias Mayer's chair. Gauss had known Weber since 1828 and
   supported his appointment. Gauss had worked on physics before 1831,
   publishing Uber ein neues allgemeines Grundgesetz der Mechanik , which
   contained the principle of least constraint, and Principia generalia
   theoriae figurae fluidorum in statu aequilibrii which discussed forces
   of attraction. These papers were based on Gauss's potential theory,
   which proved of great importance in his work on physics. He later came
   to believe his potential theory and his method of least squares
   provided vital links between science and nature.
   In 1832, Gauss and Weber began investigating the theory of terrestrial
   magnetism after Alexander von Humboldt attempted to obtain Gauss's
   assistance in making a grid of magnetic observation points around the
   Earth. Gauss was excited by this prospect and by 1840 he had written
   three important papers on the subject: Intensitas vis magneticae
   terrestris ad mensuram absolutam revocata (1832), Allgemeine Theorie
   des Erdmagnetismus (1839) and Allgemeine Lehrs�tze in Beziehung auf
   die im verkehrten Verh�ltnisse des Quadrats der Entfernung wirkenden
   Anziehungs- und Abstossungskr�fte (1840). These papers all dealt with
   the current theories on terrestrial magnetism, including Poisson's
   ideas, absolute measure for magnetic force and an empirical definition
   of terrestrial magnetism. Dirichlet's principal was mentioned without
   proof.
   Allgemeine Theorie... showed that there can only be two poles in the
   globe and went on to prove an important theorem, which concerned the
   determination of the intensity of the horizontal component of the
   magnetic force along with the angle of inclination. Gauss used the
   Laplace equation to aid him with his calculations, and ended up
   specifying a location for the magnetic South pole.
   Humboldt had devised a calendar for observations of magnetic
   declination. However, once Gauss's new magnetic observatory (completed
   in 1833 - free of all magnetic metals) had been built, he proceeded to
   alter many of Humboldt's procedures, not pleasing Humboldt greatly.
   However, Gauss's changes obtained more accurate results with less
   effort.
   Gauss and Weber achieved much in their six years together. They
   discovered Kirchhoff's laws, as well as building a primitive telegraph
   device which could send messages over a distance of 5000 ft. However,
   this was just an enjoyable pastime for Gauss. He was more interested
   in the task of establishing a world-wide net of magnetic observation
   points. This occupation produced many concrete results. The
   Magnetischer Verein and its journal were founded, and the atlas of
   geomagnetism was published, while Gauss and Weber's own journal in
   which their results were published ran from 1836 to 1841.
   In 1837, Weber was forced to leave G�ttingen when he became involved
   in a political dispute and, from this time, Gauss's activity gradually
   decreased. He still produced letters in response to fellow scientists'
   discoveries usually remarking that he had known the methods for years
   but had never felt the need to publish. Sometimes he seemed extremely
   pleased with advances made by other mathematicians, particularly that
   of Eisenstein and of Lobachevsky.
   Gauss spent the years from 1845 to 1851 updating the G�ttingen
   University widow's fund. This work gave him practical experience in
   financial matters, and he went on to make his fortune through shrewd
   investments in bonds issued by private companies.
   Two of Gauss's last doctoral students were Moritz Cantor and Dedekind.
   Dedekind wrote a fine description of his supervisor
     ... usually he sat in a comfortable attitude, looking down, slightly
     stooped, with hands folded above his lap. He spoke quite freely,
     very clearly, simply and plainly: but when he wanted to emphasise a
     new viewpoint ... then he lifted his head, turned to one of those
     sitting next to him, and gazed at him with his beautiful,
     penetrating blue eyes during the emphatic speech. ... If he
     proceeded from an explanation of principles to the development of
     mathematical formulas, then he got up, and in a stately very upright
     posture he wrote on a blackboard beside him in his peculiarly
 he always succeeded through economy and
     deliberate arrangement in making do with a rather small space. For
     numerical examples, on whose careful completion he placed special
     value, he brought along the requisite data on little slips of paper.
   Gauss presented his golden jubilee lecture in 1849, fifty years after
   his diploma had been granted by Hemstedt University. It was
   appropriately a variation on his dissertation of 1799. From the
   mathematical community only Jacobi and Dirichlet were present, but
   Gauss received many messages and honours.
   From 1850 onwards Gauss's work was again of nearly all of a practical
   nature although he did approve Riemann's doctoral thesis and heard his
   probationary lecture. His last known scientific exchange was with
   Gerling. He discussed a modified Foucalt pendulum in 1854. He was also
   able to attend the opening of the new railway link between Hanover and
   G�ttingen, but this proved to be his last outing. His health
   deteriorated slowly, and Gauss died in his sleep early in the morning
   of 23 February, 1855.

PIERRE DE FERMAT (1601 - 1665)
   From `A Short Account of the History of Mathematics' (4th edition,
   1908) by W. W. Rouse Ball.
   While Descartes was laying the foundations of analytical geometry, the
   same subject was occupying the attention of another and not less
   distinguished Frenchman. This was Fermat. Pierre de Fermat, who was
   born near Montauban in 1601, and died at Castres on January 12, 1665,
   was the son of a leather-merchant; he was educated at home; in 1631 he
   obtained the post of councillor for the local parliament at Toulouse,
   and he discharged the duties of the office with scrupulous accuracy
   and fidelity. There, devoting most of his leisure to mathematics, he
   spent the remainder of his life - a life which, but for a somewhat
   acrimonious dispute with Descartes on the validity of certain analysis
   used by the latter, was unruffled by any event which calls for special
   notice. The dispute was chiefly due to the obscurity of Descartes, but
   the tact and courtesy of Fermat brought it to a friendly conclusion.
   Fermat was a good scholar, and amused himself by conjecturally
   restoring the work of Apollonius on plane loci.
   Except a few isolated papers, Fermat published nothing in his
   lifetime, and gave no systematic exposition of his methods. Some of
   the most striking of his results were found after his death on loose
   sheets of paper or written in the margins of works which he had read
   and annotated, and are unaccompanied by any proof. It is thus somewhat
   difficult to estimate the dates and originality of his work. He was
   constitutionally modest and retiring, and does not seem to have
   intended his papers to be published. It is probable that he revised
   his notes as occasion required, and that his published works represent
   the final form of his researches, and therefore cannot be dated much
   earlier than 1660. I shall consider separately (i) his investigations
   in the theory of numbers; (ii) his use in geometry of analysis and of
   infinitesimals; and (iii) his method for treating questions of
   probability.
   (i) The theory of numbers appears to have been the favourite study of
   Fermat. He prepared an edition of Diophantus, and the notes and
   comments thereon contain numerous theorems of considerable elegance.
   Most of the proofs of Fermat are lost, and it is possible that some of
   them were not rigorous - an induction by analogy and the intuition of
   genius sufficing to lead him to correct results. The following
   examples will illustrate these investigations.
   (a) If p be a prime and a be prime to p then a^(p-1) - 1 � is
   divisible by p, that is, a^(p-1) - 1 \equiv 0 � (mod p). A proof of
   this, first given by Euler, is well known. A more general theorem is
   that a^(\phi(n)) - 1 \equiv 0 (mod n) � (mod n), where a is prime to n
   and \phi(n) � is the number of integers less than n and prime to it.
   (b) An odd prime can be expressed as the difference of two square
   integers in one and only one way. Fermat's proof is as follows. Let n
   be the prime, and suppose it equal to x� - y�, that is, to (x + y)(x -
   y). Now, by hypothesis, the only integral factors of n are n and
   unity, hence x + y = n and x - y = 1. Solving these equations we get x
   = � (n + 1) and y = � (n - 1).
   (c) He gave a proof of the statement made by Diophantus that the sum
   of the squares of two integers cannot be of the form 4n - 1; and he
   added a corollary which I take to mean that it is impossible that the
   product of a square and a prime of the form 4n - 1 [even if multiplied
   by a number prime to the latter], can be either a square or the sum of
   two squares. For example, 44 is a multiple of 11 (which is of the form
   4 � 3 - 1) by 4, hence it cannot be expressed as the sum of two
   squares. He also stated that a number of the form a� + b�, where a is
   prime to b, cannot be divided by a prime of the form 4n - 1.
   (d) Every prime of the form 4n + 1 is expressible, and that in one way
   only, as the sum of two squares. This problem was first solved by
   Euler, who shewed that a number of the form 2^m (4n + 1) can be always
   expressed as the sum of two squares.
   (e) If a, b, c, be integers, such that a� + b� = c�, then ab cannot be
   a square. Lagrange gave a solution of this.
   (f) The determination of a number x such that x�n + 1 may be a square,
   where n is a given integer which is not a square. Lagrange gave a
   solution of this.
   (g) There is only one integral solution of the equation x� + 2 = y�;
   and there are only two integral solutions of the equation x� + 4 = y�.
   The required solutions are evidently for the first equation x = 5, and
   for the second equation x = 2 and x = 11. This question was issued as
   a challenge to the English mathematicians Wallis and Digby.
   (h) No integral values of x, y, z can be found to satisfy the equation
   x^n + y^n = z^n ; if n be an integer greater than 2. This proposition
   has acquired extraordinary celebrity from the fact that no general
   demonstration of it has been given, but there is no reason to doubt
   that it is true.
   Probably Fermat discovered its truth first for the case n = 3, and
   then for the case n = 4. His proof for the former of these cases is
   lost, but that for the latter is extant, and a similar proof for the
   case of n = 3 was given by Euler. These proofs depend on shewing that,
   if three integral values of x, y, z can be found which satisfy the
   equation, then it will be possible to find three other and smaller
   integers which also satisfy it: in this way, finally, we shew that the
   equation must be satisfied by three values which obviously do not
   satisfy it. Thus no integral solution is possible. It would seem that
   this method is inapplicable to any cases except those of n = 3 and n =
   4.
   Fermat's discovery of the general theorem was made later. A proof can
   be given on the assumption that a number can be resolved into the
   product of powers of primes in one and only one way. The assumption
   has been made by some writers; it is true of real numbers, but it is
   not necessarily true of every complex number. It is possible that
   Fermat made some erroneous supposition, but, on the whole, it seems
   more likely that he discovered a rigorous demonstration.
   In 1823 Legendre obtained a proof for the case of n = 5; in 1832
   Lejeune Dirichlet gave one for n = 14, and in 1840 Lam� and Lebesgue
   gave proofs for n = 7. The proposition appears to be true universally,
   and in 1849 Kummer, by means of ideal primes, proved it to be so for
   all numbers except those (if any) which satisfy three conditions. It
   is not certain whether any number can be found to satisfy these
   conditions, but there is no number less than 100 which does so. The
   proof is complicated and difficult, and there can be no doubt is based
   on considerations unknown to Fermat. I may add that, to prove the
   truth of the proposition, when n is greater than 4 obviously it is
   sufficient to confine ourselves to cases when n is a prime, and the
   first step in Kummer's demonstration is to shew that one of the
   numbers x, y, z must be divisible by n.
   The following extracts, from a letter now in the university library at
   Leyden, will give an idea of Fermat's methods; the letter is undated,
   but it would appear that, at the time Fermat wrote it, he had proved
   the proposition (h) above only for the case when n = 3.
     Je ne m'en servis au commencement qe pour demontrer les propositions
     negatives, comme par exemple, qu'il n'y a aucu nombre moindre de
     l'unit� qu'un multiple de 3 qui soit compos� d'un quarr� et du
     triple d'un autre quarr�. Qu'il n'y a aucun triangle rectangle de
     nombres dont l'aire soit un nombre quarr�. La preuve se fait par
     apagogeen � en cette mani�re. S'il y auoit aucun triangle rectangle
     en nombres entiers, qui eust son aire esgale � un quarr�, il y
     auroit un autre triangle moindre que celuy la qui auroit la mesme
     propriet�. S'il y en auoit un second moindre que le premier qui eust
     la mesme propriet� il y en auroit par un pareil raisonnement un
     troisieme moindre que ce second qui auroit la mesme propriet� et
     enfin un quatrieme, un cinquieme etc. a l'infini en descendant. Or
     est il qu'estant donn� un nombre il n'y en a point infinis en
     descendant moindres que celuy la, j'entens parler tousjours des
     nombres entiers. D'ou on conclud qu'il est donc impossible qu'il y
     ait aucun triangle rectange dont l'aire soit quarr�. Vide foliu post
     sequens....
     Je fus longtemps sans pouvour appliquer ma methode aux questions
     affirmatives, parce que le tour et le biais pour y venir est
     beaucoup plus malais� que celuy dont je me sers aux negatives. De
     sorte que lors qu'il me falut demonstrer que tout nombre premier qui
     surpasse de l'unit� un multiple de 4, est compos� de deux quarrez je
     me treuvay en belle peine. Mais enfin une meditation diverses fois
     reiter�e me donna les lumieres qui me manquoient. Et les questions
     affirmatives passerent par ma methods a l'ayde de quelques nouveaux
     principes qu'il y fallust joindre par necessit�. Ce progres de mon
     raisonnement en ces questions affirmatives estoit tel. Si un nombre
     premier pris a discretion qui surpasse de l'unit� un multiple de 4
     n'est point compos� de deux quarrez il y aura un nombre premier de
     mesme nature moindre que le donn�; et ensuite un troisieme encore
     moindre, etc. en descendant a l'infini jusques a ce que vous
     arriviez au nombre 5, qui est le moindre de tous ceux de cette
     nature, lequel il s'en suivroit n'estre pas compos� de deux quarrez,
     ce qu'il est pourtant d'ou on doit inferer par la deduction a
     l'impossible que tous ceux de cette nature sont par consequent
     composez de 2 quarrez.
     Il y a infinies questions de cette espece. Mais il y en a quelques
     autres que demandent de nouveaux principes pour y appliquer la
     descente, et la recherche en est quelques fois si mal ais�e, qu'on
     n'y peut venir qu'avec une peine extreme. Telle est la question
     suivante que Bachet sur Diophante avo�e n'avoir jamais peu
     demonstrer, sur le suject de laquelle Mr. Descartes fait dans une de
     ses lettres la mesme declaration, jusques la qu'il confesse qu'il la
     juge si difficile, qu'il ne voit point de voye pour la resoudre.
     Tout nombre est quarr�, ou compos� de deux, de trois, ou de quatre
     quarrez. Je l'ay enfin rang�e sous ma methode et je demonstre que si
     un nombre donn� n'estoit point de cette nature il y en auroit un
     moindre que ne le seroit par non plus, puis un troisieme moindre que
     le second etc. a l'infini, d'ou l'on infere que tous les nombres
     sont de cette nature....
     J'ay ensuit consider� questions que bien que negatives ne restent
     pas de recevoir tres-grande difficult�, la methods pour y pratiquer
     la descente estant tout a fait diverse des precedentes comme il sera
     ais� d'espouver. Telles sont les suivantes. Il n'y a aucun cube
     divisible en deux cubes. Il n'y a qu'un seul quarr� en entiers que
     augment� du binaire fasse un cube, ledit quarr� est 25. Il n'y a que
     deux quarrez en entiers lesquels augment�s de 4 fassent cube,
     lesdits quarrez sont 4 et 121....
     Apres avoir couru toutes ces questions la plupart de diverses (sic)
     nature et de differente fa�on de demonstrer, j'ay pass� a
     l'invention des regles generales pour resoudre les equations simples
     et doubles de Diophante. On propose par exemple 2 quarr. + 7957
     esgaux a un quarr� (hoc est 2xx + 7967 \propto � quadr.) J'ay une
     regle generale pour resoudre cette equation si elle est possible, on
     decouvrir son impossibilit�. Et ainsi en tous les cas et en tous
     nombres tant des quarrez que des unitez. On propose cette equation
     double 2x + 3 et 3x + 5 esgaux chaucon a un quarr�. Bachet se
     glorifie en ses commentaires sur Diophante d'avoir trouv� une regle
     en deux cas particuliers. Je me donne generale en toute sorte de
     cas. Et determine par regle si elle est possible ou non....
     Voila sommairement le conte de mes recherches sur le sujet des
     nombres. Je ne l'ay escrit que parce que j'apprehende que le loisir
     d'estendre et de mettre au long toutes ces demonstrations et ces
     methodes me manquera. En tout cas cette indication seruira aux
     s�auants pour trouver d'eux mesmes ce que je n'estens point,
     principlement si Mr. de Carcaui et Frenicle leur font part de
     quelques demonstrations par la descente que je leur ay envoyees sur
     le suject de quelques propositions negatives. Et peut estre la
     posterit� me scaure gr� de luy avoir fait connoistre que les anciens
     n'ont pas tout sceu, et cette relation pourra passer dans l'esprit
     de ceux qui viendront apres moy pour traditio lampadis ad filios,
     comme parle le grand Chancelier d'Angleterre, suivant le sentiment
     et la devise duquel j'adjousteray, multi pertransibunt et augebitur
     scientia.
   (ii) I next proceed to mention Fermat's use in geometry of analysis
   and of infinitesimals. It would seem from his correspondence that he
   had thought out the principles of analytical geometry for himself
   before reading Descartes's G�om�trie, and had realised that from the
   equation, or, as he calls it, the ``specific property,'' of a curve
   all its properties could be deduced. His extant papers on geometry
   deal, however, mainly with the application of infinitesimals to the
   determination of the tangents to curves, to the quadrature of curves,
   and to questions of maxima and minima; probably these papers are a
   revision of his original manuscripts (which he destroyed), and were
   written about 1663, but there is no doubt that he was in possession of
   the general idea of his method for finding maxima and minima as early
   as 1628 or 1629.
   He obtained the subtangent to the ellipse, cycloid, cissoid, conchoid,
   and quadratrix by making the ordinates of the curve and a straight
   line the same for two points whose abscissae were x and x - e; but
   there is nothing to indicate that he was aware that the process was
   general, it is probable that he never separated it, so to speak, from
   the symbols of the particular problem he was considering. The first
   definite statement of the method was due to Barrow, and was published
   in 1669.
   Fermat also obtained the areas of parabolas and hyperbolas of any
   order, and determined the centres of mass of a few simple laminae and
   of a paraboloid of revolution. As an example of his method of solving
   these questions I will quote his solution of the problem to find the
   area between the parabola y� = p x�, the axis of x, and the line x =
   a. He says that, if the several ordinates of the points for which x
   is equal to a, a(1 - e), a(1 - e)�,... be drawn, then the area will be
   split into a number of little rectangles whose areas are respectively
     ae(pa^2)^(1/3), ae(1-e) ( pa^2(1-e)^2 )^(1/3),... .
   The sum of these is p^(1/3) a^(5/3) e / ( 1 - (1 - e)^(5/3) ) ; and by
   a subsidiary proposition (for he was not acquainted with the binomial
   theorem) he finds the limit of this, when e vanishes, to be (3/5)
   p^(1/3) a^(5/3) . The theorems last mentioned were published only
   after his death; and probably they were not written till after he had
   read the works of Cavalieri and Wallis.
   Kepler had remarked that the values of a function immediately adjacent
   to and on either side of a maximum (or minimum) value must be equal.
   Fermat applied this principle to a few examples. Thus, to find the
   maximum value of x(a - x), his method is essentially equivalent to
   taking a consecutive value of x, namely x - e where e is very small,
   and putting x(a - x) = (x - e)(a - x + e). Simplifying, and ultimately
   putting e = 0, we get x = �. This value of x makes the given
   expression a maximum.
   (iii) Fermat must share with Pascal the honour of having founded the
   theory of probabilities. I have already mentioned the problem proposed
   to Pascal, and which he communicated to Fermat, and have there given
   Pascal's solution. Fermat's solution depends on the theory of
   combinations, and will be sufficiently illustrated by the following
   example, the substance of which is taken from a letter dated August
   24, 1654, which occurs in the correspondence with Pascal. Fermat
   discusses the case of two players, A and B, where A wants two points
   to win and B three points. Then the game will be certainly decided in
   the course of four trials. Take the letters a and b, and write down
   all the combinations that can be formed of four letters. These
   combinations are 16 in number, namely, aaaa, aaab, aaba, aabb; abaa,
   abab, abba, abbb; baaa, baab, baba, babb; bbaa, bbab, bbba, bbbb. Now
   every combination in which a occurs twice or oftener represents a case
   favourable to A, and every combination in which b occurs three times
   or oftener represents a case favourable to B. Thus, on counting them,
   it will be found that there are 11 cases favourable to A, and 5 cases
   favourable to B; and since these cases are all equally likely, A's
   chance of winning the game is to B's chance as 11 is to 5.
   The only other problem on this subject which, as far as I know,
   attracted the attention of Fermat was also proposed to him by Pascal,
   and was as follows. A person undertakes to throw a six with a die in
   eight throws; supposing him to have made three throws without success,
   what portion of the stake should he be allowed to take on condition of
   giving up his fourth throw? Fermat's reasoning is as follows. The
   chance of success is 1/6, so that he should be allowed to take 1/6 of
   the stake on condition of giving up his throw. But if we wish to
   estimate the value of the fourth throw before any throw is made, then
   the first throw is worth 1/6 of the stake; the second is worth 1/6 of
   what remains, that is 5/36 of the stake; the third throw is worth 1/6
   of what now remains, that is, 25/216 of the stake; the fourth throw is
   worth 1/6 of what now remains, that is, 125/1296 of the stake.
   Fermat does not seem to have carried the matter much further, but his
   correspondence with Pascal shows that his views on the fundamental
   principles of the subject were accurate: those of Pascal were not
   altogether correct.
   Fermat's reputation is quite unique in the history of science. The
   problems on numbers which he had proposed long defied all efforts to
   solve them, and many of them yielded only to the skill of Euler. One
   still remains unsolved. This extraordinary achievement has
   overshadowed his other work, but in fact it is all of the highest
   order of excellence, and we can only regret that he thought fit to
   write so little.

Gauss and Fermat both published or shared their works with others
contemporaries as demonstrated via their short biographies that I submitted
to the list.
If one doesn't publish (which in the scientific sense means to share
publicly ones discoveries, *not* necessarily in open literature - which is a
constraint you have never implied before now - changing the rules in the
middle of the game are we...and while you go ballistic - when Gauss and
Fermat were alive there were no magazines, work was published via
demonstrations, books or by letters shared between co-workers) then be so
kind as to explain how anyone would find out about the work in the first
place, divine intervention?
What Ulam, Teller, Von Neumann did regarding actualy making the devices;
such as the work on explosive lenses; was *engineering or technology* it
wasn't science. Science as was extant at the time was quite capable of
describing what needed to be done, the question was how to build the damn
thing. THAT question is technological not scientific. Furher, at *no* time
did I imply that those working on the bomb simply quite working on the
theoretical issues that were still unanswered. The reality is, as my
original claim, that the process *required both*. However, taking this to
the extreme, as you are want to do, of equating them is a disservice to
their achievements and the endeavors of science and engineering.
Further, if you had done one whit of research on the Manhatten Project you
would have found that the *primary* issue for most of the scientist was that
the military wouldn't allow them to *share their work*. In many of the
letters, depositions, minutes of meetings, etc. there are continous and
heated discussion on how the secrecy impacted negatively the process of
meeting their goals. Ulam, Teller, Von Neumann, et ali. would be the *first*
to refute your claim.
And very little of what they didn't publish outside of the CCCP made a big
difference to what others were doing. As a matter of fact, because of this
many of the Russian scientists are reaping the rewards by being passed over
for Nobels and other such rewards for sharing their work. A very clear
result of this policy in the CCCP was the technological 2nd class that
resulted in just about every aspect of Soviet science and engineering
outside of some very esoteric and theoretical work. A primary example of
*why* and *how* such secrecy *inhibits* rather than promotes science is a
study of Russian biological sciences. If you seriously claim that the policy
of state secrecy didn't inhibit russian science then be so kind as to
explain their clones of the Apple II or the IBM 360, which were truly
attrocious in their technology. Just look at the impact on China because of
these sorts of policies, it was in the late 1970's before they ever managed
to build a TTL equivalent quad-NAND gate, something that the western world
had been cranking out since the late 1960's. I got involved in computers and
electronics in 1969 *because* those self same 7400 chips were *dumped on the
surplus market*. Prey tell how we managed to create a technological millieu
that allows 9 year old kids to play with chips for pennies when a whole damn
country with a population in the billions can't manage to build and use till
nearly 10 years later? Malarky. If you simply review the history of science (something that is
becoming clear you haven't) and study some of these great luminaries works
you find that *critical* to all of them was *sharing* their work(s) with
others of a similar bent. Their biographies are replete with mentions of
letters, meetings, books, etc. they both supplied and received from others.
Back to Newton, he graduated in 1665 w/ a BA from Cambridge. Shortly before
this he had begun his experiments in light. He published these results in
'Philosophical Transactions' in 1672 and was elected a fellow of the Royal
Society the same year because of it. In 1687, at Halleys prompting to
abandon his chemical studies (he was an alchemist) and focus on mechanics,
he published 'Principia'. This same year is when he became involved in
politics which eventualy resulted in his appointment in 1689 to the
Convention Parliament of the university. In 1695 he was appointed the Warden
of the Mint. In 1727 he was appointed Master of the Mint, which he held
until his death. In 1703 he became the president of the Royal Society.
That same year he published 'Opticks'. In 1705 he was knighted. He also
wrote religous works, two of the best known were 'Observations of the
Prophecies of Daniel' and 'Church History'.
How in good faith you can claim this doesn't qualify as sharing their work
and that such sharing isn't critical to advancement is truly revealing.

@_subject: More on Fermat... 
Given Tim May's assertion that publishing is not critical to the advancement
of science *and* that Fermat is a prime example of this I would like to
examine it.
Let's ignore the references to Fermat's letters and such to Pascal,
Descarte, and others. Let's take as a given that Fermat's work was not
published. When he died the executors found the material and decided to
publish it (we'll ignore their motives for a moment). The result was a
global 'aha' for mathematicians. A collective "Ah, so THAT's how you do
Since it is clear that had Fermat's work *not* been published those self
same problems would have remained unsolved, perhaps some as long as his Last
Theorem which stands as a prime example of the result of *not* publishing or
noting results, perhaps some even till today. It is clear that the initial
hypothesis that publishing (or sharing) of work is not critical is clearly
incorrect by the very example it holds to prove itself.

I'm not shure who the 'Your' is but I'd like to add some comments on these
issues and observations.
If you don't know something you either can't take advantage of it or else
you have to rediscover it on your own. It is clear that if everyone had to
re-invent the wheel at every step then not much would get done.
Nobody has a responsbility to publish. Science is a completely voluntary
pursuit. I would contend personaly that if you don't publish you arent'
doing science but rather mental masturbation (a rather selfish pursuit I
I don't think this is relevant to the issue at all.
Who spoke of true scientist? A 3 year old kid poking at a lightening bug on
a warm summer eve is as much a true scientist as a Nobel prize winner working
on cosmology, the reason is that *both* will share it with anyone they can
get to hold still long enough to listen. We have been speaking of the impact
of sharing data on the expansion of scienctific knowledge. The actual logic
is remakably simple. If you don't let others know of your work then others
must recreate it or it gets lost and the consequences of that is that whole
areas of knowledge go unvisited potentialy forever. When *they* share it
*they* get credit for it not you (which may or may not be a motive of the
individual, it certainly has *nothing* to do with actualy doing science
however; it's sorta like why some boy asked you out when you were a kid, they
either wanted in your pants or had a genuine interest in your company, or
perpaps even both. In any case this has nothing to do with the fact that a
date is occurring, it's the mechanism and not the motive that is important).
To share ones knowledge with others in such a manner that they may
indipendantly verify the results to demonstrate some general pattern in the
mechanism(s) of the cosmos. Once this is done the next step is to
explore the consequences of this new set of general patterns and what the
new understanding leads to.
I don't think science needs great minds as much as it offers a set of
opportunities to apply those talents in a challenging manner that is not
present in many other human pursuits. The relationship is like a moth to a
flame (hopefuly with less drastic consequences than for the moth).
To jump from sharing your work with others in the scientific community and
equating that community to the public is a bit of a leap. The vast majority
of folks wouldn't have a clue what to do with any particular piece of work,
let alone how to use it to get something else that wasn't known. Most
scientist can't fully apply results from other fields unless they happen to
be a polymath or possess some special insight or ability (such as a savante,
a good example is Gauss' being able to instantly see how to sum the first
100 numbers by pairings). To do science requires a discipline that even many
of those who are trying to do science aren't successful at aquiring.
Then perhaps they aren't doing science. One also has to look at the
motivation of why they aren't publishing. It could be that they don't trust
their results, feel that nobody will understand them because of the esoteric
nature, simple bashfulness gone extreme, or open hostility or asocial
tendencies. This last issue raises a whole range of questions and
conclusions about 'great minds' and their 'quirkiness' and commen bahaviour.
It isn't a question of what I think or some definition of 'true scientist'.
It *is* a consequence of what is required to do science which requires that
the work you do is shared with others so *they* don't have to recreate it
and therefore waste time and effort. Science, by definition, is a
collaborative effort. Consider the Fermat example from Tim May, had Fermat
went ahead and written his proof down *and* it had been found all those
people over the last 200 years would have been able to work on other
problems. What kinds of changes in our technology and as a consequence our
society would have resulted if *that* could have happened. Instead of 2 steps
forward and 1 step back we might be 3 steps forward...
I think you should be more consistent in your definition in what science is,
what it requires from its practitioners, and how that distinguishes them
from others. Simply because I slop paint on a canvas doesn't make me a
artist though it does make me a painter. And it is clear that, at least for
this example, the artist *is* a painter. 'A implying B' does *not* imply
'B implying A'.

Exactly. And it is as it should be. Consider that speech is *not* equivalent
to action (eg. swinging a fist). Running an enterprise or engaging in some
activity *is* equivalent to the party swinging their fist. They have a
*right* to swing it so long as it *doesn't* interfere in others right to
swing their fist *and* the first parties swinging doesn't strike the second
party. In short, a party has the right to make as much money as they like,
however that right does not extend to the point of inhibiting others from
similar opportunities. A free market monopolizes, that monopolization
inhibits others from expressing their rights in the same manner that hitting
some person in the face inhibits their fist swinging because they are out
cold on the floor. As a consequence a free market is inherently inhibiting
on free expression - something any self-respecting anarchist won't put up
with. So we are left with the very simple conclusion that any anarchist
worth the title won't put up with a free market because it creates an
environment that creates a monarchy.
It is logicaly inconsistent, and philosophicaly nonsensical, to talk about
being an anarchist of any ilk *and* talking about supporting free markets.

Given that anarchist don't support a 'head' in regards to human activities
*and* that a free market monopolizes thus creating a 'head' it is clear that if we apply the ideas of human society (ie political systems) to
economics we derive a fundamental conflict, that a anarchist in the economic
sphere is left with no choice but to agree that economic systems must be
managed and creates a 'head' either by plan or monopolistic fiat.
Therefore the original thesis that such political models are applicable to
economic ones is flawed. It simply is not possible for an economic system to
exhist without some sort of 'head' or guiding structure. This is
fundamentaly at odds with the definition and spirit of anarchy.

I believe this view to be fundamentaly flawed. Consider that if a particular
scientist doesn't publish (ala Fermat) then this does not inherently
prohibit or inhibit others from deriving the result (lot's of examples so I
won't pick a single one). However, when an artist or other practitioner of
human expression fails to publish then an item of unique character is lost.
Had T.S. Elliot not written 'Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats' it is
*very* unlikely that *anyone* in the entire remaining history of the
universe would have written those charming poems and we would be deprived
among other things of knowing why a cat has three names. In addition, the
fact that a given individual finds no worth in why a cat has three names
does not change the worth of the insight provided by the author. So, while a
given art critics views may not mean much to you this does not justify in
any manner trivializing that worth for others. To do so would indicate a
personality of extreme hubris and potentialy a severe sociopathy. Expect
them to begin walking around with their hand in their vest at any moment.
The distinction is that human expression doesn't assume homogeneity nor
isotropy as science requires. Rather it assumes a priori that each activity
and it's result is unique in the history of the universe and fundamentaly an
expression of that *individual* view of experience. That is what art derives
it worth from while science derives its worth from the result being the same
irrespective of the practitioner.
And before somebody brings it up, while reality *is* observer dependant,
this is a recognition that the act of testing is fundamentaly a part of the
sytsem being tested. The statistical results *are* homogenious and
isotropic for observers - Fire in the Deep not withstanding.
            The end of our exploring will be to arrive at where we
            started, and to know the place for the first time.

Check out the current 'Justice Files' on The Discovery Channle. The general
gist is that individual prior to being proven a criminal have too many civil
liberties and as a result police are hindered in their duties.
It'd be pretty funny if it wasn't serious.

Which one was it? I had the privilege of working on the IBM Leonardo
exhibit when it was in Austin at Discovery Hall about 10 years ago. Part of my
duties was to repair two of his models (the 'turtle' tank & his composite

There was a show on one of the cable science shows about Leonardo week before

Malarky, the history of science (and of human civilizations) is replete with
example after example of idividuals discovering the same basic theme and its
proof. Just the three examples we have been using (Newton, Gauss, Fermat)
are filled with comments about contemporaries discovering the same result.
Review Darwin for a moment, he chose to share the fame for evolutionary
theory with Wallace because he had reached the same conclusion. Had either
Darwin or Wallace not chose to publish the result would still have been
found and shared.
Only in the context that they are both poets who write poetry.

@_subject: A further thought on free markets & anarchy... (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
First, it isn't magic. It is the realization that any market is limited by
several factors (eg number of customers, limited raw resources, startup
costs) and that even a small superiority in one businesses ability to
produce their service or product over time will provide them with an
increased share of those limited resources and the share in profits that
acrue as a result. As their share, and hence their control over, those
resources increases the competitors are faced with the prospect of having
to go to the competitor to get what they need in order to compete.
It is *not* a part of any free market theory that I am aware of that
pre-supposes that a given business entity will, for whatever reason, of its
own free will guarantee the continued existance of competition. If anything
the long term goal of any business is to reduce competition.
If we accept the commen view of free markets and the one you seem to be
saying is the reality, we shouldn't worry about Microsoft. One morning
they'll all wake and realize that if they don't keep HP, Sun, IBM, Apple
in business they won't have competition. As a consequence of that
realization they will in fact provide contracts or other forms of
renumeration to their competitors to keep them in business and hence able to
take potential sales away from Microsoft.
What I am saying is given the environment and goals of operating a
for-profit firm the supposition that a free market will somehow prevent
monopolization is incorrect. I am saying that a free market economy when
operating without outside 3rd party guidance or some form of economic bill
of rights will by its very nature monopolize and reduce competition due to
nothing more than minute superiorities of individual business models and
the efficiency those businesses acrue over time as a result.
But the free market model as currently understood is an anarchy, at least at
the beginning. The reason that it falls into this category is that there is
no governing body or bill of rights. Each business is left to its own ends
and the consequences thereof. There are no externaly enforced limitations on
business practices in this model. Further, regulation of unfair (whatever
that means in a free market - personaly I thinks its a spin doctorism
equivalent to saying you can have an anarchy without inherent use of
violence) practices is completely abandoned other than the assumption that
eventualy competitors and consumers will learn of those practicies and quite
dealing with that business. The problem with that assumption is that by the
time such practices become known there may be no competitors and the consumers
only option might be to simply have to do without the item completely. In
the case of a life sustaining resource this is no option at all.
The point I am making is that the arguments that support political models of
social activity are not mappable to the economic ones in a simple one-to-one
method as the free market model (and many others) assume in a axiomatic
manner. That in fact, because of the inherent limitations of a market which
is not one-to-one mappable to the range of human expression (the field of
social systems) which has no inherent limitations in resources or means
such comparisons are flawed by this axiomatic assumption.
The history of economics is filled with examples of markets without
regulation becoming monopolized. There was the example yesterday or the day
before regarding some rail baron and how they cornered the oil market
because they realized the efficiency advantage of using rail based oil
carriers. Look at Microsoft, the airlines prior to federal regulation.
The the long-haul trucking industry, the teamsters, etc., etc.
Microsoft certainly didn't have political supperiorty? And how can you in
good faith sneak in this concept of 'political superiority' into a discussion
of free markets which a priori and in an axiomatic manner require that such
regulation and their inherent regulatory bodies do *not* exist and most
certainly do not inhibit or otherwise limit the options available to a
commerical enterprise in that market. Smacks of changing the rules in the
middle of the game.

Unit 1: The Scope and Method of Economics [INLINE] UNDER CONSTRUCTION
   Read "Case and Fair": Chapter 1 - pages 1-20.
     _________________________________________________________________
     A. Definition of Economics
     Economics is the study of how individuals and societies choose to
     use the scarce resources that nature and previous generations have
     provided.
     The key word in this definition is "choose".
     Economics is a behavioral science.
     In large measure it is the study of how people make choices.
     _________________________________________________________________
     B. Why study economics?
     1. To learn a way of thinking: This summer we are going to learn to
     think like economists - to use tools that will help us analyze
     complex situations in the real world of economics.
     2. To understand society: Past and present economic decisions have
     an influence on the character of life in a society.
     3. To understand global affairs: Understanding international
     relations begins with knowledge of the economic links among
     countries.
     4. To be an informed voter: When you participate in the political
     process, you are voting on issues that require a basic understanding
     of economics.
     _________________________________________________________________
     C. The difference between micro and macro economics
     Microeconomics deals with the functioning of individual industries
     and the behavior of individual economic decision-making units -
     business firms and households. It explores the decisions that
     individual businesses and consumers make - firms' choices about what
     to produce and how much to charge, and households' choices about
     what and how much to buy.
     Macro economics looks at the economy as a whole. Instead of trying
     to understand what determines the output of a single firm or
     industry, or the consumption patterns of a single household or group
     of house holds, it examines the factors that determine national
     output and income.
     While micro economics focuses on individual product prices, macro
     economics looks at the overall price level and its behavior over
     time.
     Micro economics questions how many people will be hired or laid off
     in a particular industry and the factors that determine how much
     labor a firm or industry will hire. Macro economics deals with
     aggregate employment and unemployment: how many jobs exist in the
     economy as a whole, and how many people are willing to work but
     unable to find jobs..
     We are going to be using this word "aggregate" a lot. It refers to
     the behavior of firms and households taken together. For example,
     aggregate consumption refers to the consumption of all the
     households in the economy; aggregate investment refers to the total
     investment made by all firms in the economy.
     There are some topics which micro and macro economics share.
     For example, the study of how government policy affects the economy.
     However, again micro economics looks at these effects on the level
     of the individual firm or household, macro economics considers the
     effects of policy on the economy as a whole..
     The micro economic foundations of macro economics.
     There is also another important relationship between the two
     branches of economics and this is what is called the micro economic
     foundations of macro economics. This is a fairly new development and
     one which is trying to reconcile the assumptions and principles of
     micro economic analysis with efforts to understand the economy as a
     whole.
     For example, in efforts to understand inflation, macro economists
     are now trying to include micro economic ideas about the way that
     prices adjust to changes in supply and demand..
     _________________________________________________________________
     D. The relationship between economics and social philosophy. One of
     the first economists was an Englishman by the name of Adam Smith.
     (Some would say he was the first economist.)
     Born in the early part of the 18th century, Smith developed the idea
     of the "invisible hand" and was the first to describe the
     relationship between supply and demand in a free market economy. He
     described himself as a "social philosopher".
     Social philosophy is concerned with fairness. It deals with
     questions such as:
     Why are some people rich and others poor?
     Is it fair that 90% of the country's wealth is controlled by 5% of
     the population?
     Is the progressive income tax, which taxes a higher proportion of
     the income of the wealthy, fair?
     These questions are still relevant and are the subject of economic
     policy.
     _________________________________________________________________
     E. Economic Policy
     A policy is a plan that guides action.
     An example of an economic policy would be the Federal government's
     plan to keep the economy working at full employment.
     Anyone can recommend macro economic policies but it is up to
     governments to implement them.
     In general we judge the outcomes of any policy according to four
     criteria:
     1. Efficiency: In economics we say that a policy is efficient if it
     leads to outcomes that help the economy produce what people want at
     the least possible cost.
     2. Equity or fairness: This is obviously hard to define because
     fairness like beauty depends on who's looking, but in general terms
     we could say that an economic policy is fair if it leads to outcomes
     in which the costs and benefits are shared in a way that is
     proportional to a person's participation.
     3. Growth: At the present time economic policies are also judged
     according to whether or not they lead to increases in output. I say
     "at present" because some economists are beginning to question the
     assumption that economic growth is always a good thing.
     4. Stability: In economics stability is defined as the condition of
     the economy in which output is growing at a steady rate, with low
     inflation and full employment. Currently, the Federal Reserve is
     defining stability as a growth rate of about 3%, with inflation
     between 2% and 3% and unemployment between 5% and 6%.
     _________________________________________________________________
     F. What economists do. In addition to making policy recommendations,
     economists spend a lot of time formulating theories and developing
     models. These two words have more or less the same meaning in
     economics that they do in other academic disciplines.
     A theory is a coherent set of hypotheses which make statements about
     the way the world works.
     To illustrate this idea of theory, the text refers to what is known
     as "the law of demand". This so-called law is really just a
     well-tested hypothesis which states that when prices fall, people
     tend to buy more, and vice versa.
     A theory is said to be "good" if its hypotheses turn out to valid
     statements about the real world and if it has predictive power.
     I should say at this point that very few economic theories,
     particularly in macro economics, have predictive power.
     A model is just a formal statement of the theory, usually a
     mathematical statement.
     Several institutions have built huge models of the US economy and
     how it works that have hundreds of equations linked together. These
     big models usually run on computers. When we visit the Federal
     Reserve in San Francisco we will see one of these models in action.
     We will also be working with a number of smaller models and a large
     number of pictures of models.
     The text points out two common errors that are made when people
     develop theories or build models. These are:
     1. The post hoc fallacy: This mistake is made when someone mistakes
     an association between two variables for a cause and effect
     relationship. My favorite example of this is taken from a study done
     in Holland at the end of WWII which showed a positive relationship
     between the number of storks inhabiting a certain city and the
     number of babies born.
     2. The fallacy of composition: This has to do with the belief that
     what is true for the part is also true for the whole. There are many
     examples of this kind of thinking in economics. For example, we have
     seen over a very long period of time the benefits of free markets -
     the efficiencies in individual markets that are created whenever
     people are free to pursue their own self-interest. However, it might
     be a mistake to assume that pursuit of one's own self interest was
     the best thing for society as a whole.
     You cannot prove a theory.
     It is important to note that neither theories nor models can ever be
     proved beyond the shadow of a doubt. The best we can say of a theory
     is that it is consistent with the facts as currently observed and
     that it is seems to have predictive power.
     Another fact about theories is that they are always based on certain
     assumptions which have to be accepted for the theory to work.
     For example, in economic theory two of the most important
     assumptions are (1) that people make rational choices based on
     analyzing costs and benefits and (2) that people try to maximize
     utility.
     Another important assumption that is rarely discussed is that the
     world of economics can be understood by understanding the behavior
     of discrete variables.
     All of these assumptions are now under attack.
     _________________________________________________________________
     G. Other Important Concepts Introduced in Chapter 1
     1. Opportunity Cost: This can be understood as the cost of lost
     opportunities. An example would be the opportunity cost of coming to
     Skyline this summer. This cost is measured by the wages I could have
     been earning if I had decided to work instead.
     The reason that opportunity costs exist is because resources are
     scarce; it is an especially important concept in economics where we
     are often trying to measure the costs and benefits of different
     economic choices, policies, etc.
     2. Marginal: This refers to the "last unit" and is also an important
     factor in making economic choices.
     For example, suppose the publisher of our textbook is trying to
     calculate the costs of producing more books. In making this
     calculation, Prentice Hall would only consider the marginal or
     additional costs of just these new books. The money they have
     already spent would be irrelevant. These are the sunk costs and even
     though they would be included in a calculation of average costs,
     they wouldn't influence the decision to produce additional books.
     3. Markets - free and regulated, efficient and inefficient:
     Markets can be free or regulated, efficient or inefficient. Most
     markets in the real economy represent some combination of these
     qualities.
     A market is said to be free if buyers and sellers are free to come
     together and make deals without government interference.
     A regulated market is one where the government sets at least some of
     the rules.
     For example, the stock market is relatively free - people can buy
     and sell shares of stock without much interference from the
     government. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission
     establishes many rules in this market, particularly for companies
     who wish to sell their stock.
     An efficient market is one in which there is a very rapid
     circulation of information and in which profit opportunities are
     grabbed up almost as soon as they appear. Inefficiencies arise
     wherever the flow of information is restricted and where people are
     not free to take advantage of profit opportunities.
     4. Ceteris Paribus: This is a Latin phrase which mean "all else
     equal" and refers to the difficulty of analyzing more than two
     variables at a time. It is trotted out by economists when they want
     to emphasize the fact that they are looking at a single
     relationship, holding everything else constant. For example, "The
     amount of a good or service that people want is inversely related to
     the price, ceteris paribus."
     The things that are held constant in this example are the tastes and
     preferences of consumers, the availability of substitutes etc.

Which is the reason they put the 9th and 10th in there.
Actualy it should be because people realize you don't owe that other person
an explanation for your actions and you further don't need their permission.
Of course this assumes you *aren't* using anything that belongs to them.

@_subject: rant on the morality of confidentiality (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
According to who? The scientist who is supposedly immoral? Obviously their
actions aren't against their beliefs. The observer who is claiming it is
immoral because they *believe* it to be immoral? Morality is a function of
human psychology and not a fundamental result of existance. The relationship
is similar to that between A, T, C, G, U and the genome.
Who is so moral that they may decide what is immoral? If you're a Christian
the answer is simple 'judge not lest ye be judged'. Jesus stopped the
stonning of an adulteress by saying that he who was without sin could throw
the first stone. Since he was the only one without sin (by defintion in
Christianity) he should have been the one to throw the first stone. What did
he do? He sent everyone home with the admonishment to sin no more.
It doesn't necessarily take smarts.
What truths? Science isn't involved in 'truth' let alone 'Truth'.
So you propose that ignorance of the consequences will some how protect us?
Responsibility to who? The person(s) paying the bill, your fellow scientist,
the society you live in, the world you inhabit, the generations to follow?
Don't confuse working for the state as something that somehow mediates the
basic tenents of science. If to get the job you may have to give up some
scientific practices then at that point you aren't practicing science anymore.
That's easy, the theories work when applied in experiments.
or simply send email to Ron Baalke at JPL (you could call him on the phone
if you don't mind paying the bill)
Why do they have a responsibility to drop it on your doorstep?
What book?
Everyone is like that. It is one of the reasons science requires public
dialog on its results. You can fool some of the people most of the time,
most of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all
the time.
Sooner or later somebody will notice the king (theory) is butt naked
(doesn't work when applied in experiment).
Cryptographers are scientist also.

Forwarded message:
Spin doctor bullshit. Without the research there isn't anything to publish.
By banning the basic research we would in fact be banning the publishing of
the results of that scientific research.
Not at all. Equating swinging of ones fist in a empty field and swinging it
into somebodies nose and then taking that supposition as justification to
ban fist swinging *is* most certainly unconstitutional. Furthermore, robbery
isn't illegal under the Constitution unless its the federal government
taking the material and refusing to follow the Constitutional directive to
pay for *all* property, irrespective of how it was gained, for public use as
those duties are relegated per the 10th to the purvue of the states.
The question here is whether Congress even *has* the power to regulate those
sorts of behaviours without an amendment being passed by the states to
surrender their authority per the 9th and 10th to the federal government.
Without doing the research it isn't possible to think very much about
cloning except in a *very* abstract manner. That forcing of abstraction
against ones will may very well infact be unconstitutional.
The articles contemplating the amendments are irrelevant to this issue. Only
the actual amendments are relevant. What people might *want* to do has
nothing to do with what they *can* do under the limiting documents of this
No, they are a result of political wrangling by small groups to gain
political power and the economic and social conseuences thereof. They also
result from a clearly premeditated absolution of the Constitution that these
self same 'representatives' gave an oath to uphold with their lives. The
justification that is profered is the ethics of the constituents.
Your a law professor and your logic, respect for the Constitution, and
basic scientific comprehension is this bad? No damn wonder we're in the shit
hole we're in now...

Congress' real job should not be passing laws providing funding, prohibiting
activities, etc. It *should* be in creating and passing Constitutional
amendments per the 10th that re-define the responsibilities and duties of
the federal government within the changing millieu of the current society.
This way the people via their state representatives have a much closer input
into what the feds are actualy enpowered to do and to who.

@_subject: Talk of Banning Research into Human Cloning (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
I hope they forward the CNN piece on the European ban on cloning that is
occuring as I type this. The bottem line is that saying it's ok to ban it here simply because you are
sure somebody somewhere else will allow it is reprehensible and a complete
abrogation of both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. If it's ok
to do it there, why isn't it ok to do it here? Smacks of a double standard
or some sort of surreptitious conspiracy to control the technology to the
benefit of a few. Perhaps the government has already done this research, at
Seed's estimate of $100,000 per clone, god knows they already have the money,
the equipment, and the people willing to do it.
Tell me, once the other countries have banned it will you then argue that we
should repeal our own ban and allow such research?
Bans on broadcasting without a license on an unused frequency was found
unconstitutional - it seems nobody had *ever* raised the issue before. The
interstate commerce clause was also raised and found to be potentialy
Until a few years ago the threatening of anyone, even the killing of a
president, was not a federal crime. Perhaps that original idea was that
since we believe all people to be equal under the law the killing of a bum
was no more heinous than killing of a president. One could even argue that
such classifying laws as the protection of federal employees over and above
a commen citizen are in fact against the equal treatment under the law for
all citizens that this country is founded upon.
It's 'interstate commerce', and it isn't the copyright clause per se but the
clear and plain language regarding 'advancement'. Further the clause
*specificaly* states that it is between states - by no stretch of the honest
imagination can be be construed to include private functions inside the
state boundary. Next you will be telling me I need a federal license to
program because somebody might use my software ...
Taking away peoples rights and choices is much ruder than anything you could
claim I have ever been. Why not answer the points instead of crying about
how I hurt your feelings because I won't play within the limited set of
rules you want so that you can retain the advantages of that limited set and
as a consequence not have to deal with the possible reality that your entire
suppositional set is bogus.
I know how it operates, that is why it pisses me off. It operates under the
authority of a document that prescribes in clear language how that system is
supposed to operate and specificaly describes what those limits are, how to
apply those limits to new events, and how to change those limits if they
should be felt to be too restrictive or damaging. However, those who are
entrusted with the operation believe that that self-same trust allows them
to ignore their empowering charter.
You seem unable to comprehend that perhaps the logic that has been used to
justify many of these actions is not only unconstitutional but also in the
long term detriment of the country. It's a pitty you're so close minded you
are unable to expose your delicate sensibilities to open debate.
It's a pity that your only defence is ad hominim attacks and concious
exclusion of contrary arguments because of their emotional impact on
Sir, the only thing I have left to say to you is:
Yet, it moves.

    their own personal interests and the making of their own private
    fortunes. They did not starve the people to pay for America's
    industrialization. They gave the people better jobs, higher wages, and
    cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with every
    scientific discovery or technological advance- and thus the whole
    country was moving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step of
    the way.
    - Ayn Rand
    In the United States the majority undertakes to supply a multitude of
    ready-made opinions for the use of individuals, who are thus relieved
    from the necessity of forming opinions of their own.
    - Alexis de Tocqueville

@_subject: What is the Constitution? 
Today, when a concerted effort is made to obliterate this point, it
    cannot be repeated too often that the Constitution is a limitation on
    the government, not on private individuals- that it does not prescribe
    the conduct of private individuals, only the conduct of the
    government- that it is not a charter _for_ government power, but a
    charter of the citizen's protection _against_ the government.
    - Ayn Rand

I can understand your emotional reaction to some of my wording, it is its
specific intent to ellicit such a reaction. It's a measure of the readers
maturity to be able to ignore the noise and focus on the issues. However,
in this particular case this seems to be working in the negative respecting
my goals. So, in order to open channels of dicussion I would like to make an
offer. I will desist on the use of these psychological warfare techniques
and their destabalizing effects on your emotional state *if* you will
return to an open discussion without resort to ad hominim and straw man
arguments and address the issues directly and in plain language without
resort to legalistic verbal camouflage to skirt the main points.
Thank you for your time in considering this offer.

    NAME
          ticket - authentication service
    DESCRIPTION
          This manual page describes the protocols used to authorize
          connections, confirm the identities of users and machines, and
          maintain the associated databases. The machine that provides
          these services is called the authentication server (AS). The AS
          may be a stand-alone machine or a general-use machine such as a
          CPU server. The network database ndb(6) holds for each public
          machine, such as a CPU server or file server, the name of the
          authentication server that machine uses.
          Each machine contains three values important to authentication;
          a 56-bit DES key, a 28-byte authentication ID, and a 48-byte
          authentication domain name. The ID is a user name and
          identifies who is currently responsible for the kernel running
          on that machine. The domain name identifies the machines across
          which the ID is valid. Together, the ID and domain name
          identify the owner of a key.
          When a terminal boots, the user is prompted for user name and
          password. The user name becomes the terminal's authentication
          ID. The password is converted using passtokey (see auth(2))
          into a 56-bit DES key and saved as the machine's key. The
          authentication domain is set to the null string. If possible,
          the terminal validates the key with the AS before saving it.
          For Internet machines the correct AS to ask is found using
          bootp(8). For Datakit machines the AS is a system called
          p9auth on the same Datakit node as the file server the
          terminal booted from.
          When a CPU or file server boots, it reads the key, ID, and
          domain name from non-volatile RAM. This allows servers to
          reboot without operator intervention.
          The details of any authentication are mixed with the semantics
          of the particular service they are authenticating so we
          describe them one case at a time. The following definitions
          will be used in the descriptions:
        $CH sub c$
                an 8-byte random challenge from a client
        $CH sub s$
                an 8-byte random challenge from a server
        $K sub s$
                server's key
        $K sub c$
                client's key
        $K sub n$
                a nonce key created for a ticket
        $K lbr m rbr$
                message $m$ encrypted with key $K$
        $ID sub s$
                server's ID
        $DN sub s$
                server's authentication domain name
        $ID sub c$
                client's ID
        $UID sub c$
                user's name on the client
        $UID sub s$
                user's name on the server
          A number of constants defined in auth.h are also used:
          AuthTreq, AuthChal, AuthOK, AuthErr, AuthTs, AuthTc, AuthAs,
          and AuthAc.
      File Service
          File service sessions are long-lived connections between a
          client host and a file server. Processes belonging to different
          users share the session. Whenever a user process on the client
          mounts a file server (see bind(2)), it must authenticate
          itself. There are four players in an authentication: the
          server, the client kernel, the user process on the client, and
          the authentication server. The goal of the authentication
          protocol is to convince the server that the client may validly
          speak for the user process.
          To reduce the number of messages for each authentication,
          common information is exchanged once at the beginning of the
          session within a session message (see attach(5)):         Client->Server
                Tsession($CH sub c$)
        Server->Client
                Rsession(${CH sub s},~{ID sub s},~{DN sub s}$)
          Each time a user mounts a file server connection, an attach
          message is sent identifying/authenticating the user:
        Client->Server
                Tattach($K sub s lbr AuthTs, ~ {CH sub s},~{UID sub c}, ~
                {UID sub s}, ~ K sub n rbr , ~ {K sub n} lbr AuthAc, ~
                {CH sub s}, count rbr )$
        Server->Client
                Rattach($ K sub n lbr AuthAs,~{CH sub c},~count rbr$)
          The part of the attach request encrypted with $Ksubs$ is called
          a ticket. Since it is encrypted in the server's secret key,
          this message is guaranteed to have originated on the AS. The
          part encrypted with the $K sub n$ found in the ticket is called
          an authenticator. The authenticator is generated by the client
          kernel and guarantees that the ticket was not stolen. The count
          is incremented with each mount to make every authenticator
          unique, thus foiling replay attacks. The server is itself
          authenticated by the authenticator it sends as a reply to the
          attach.
          Tickets are created by the AS at the request of a user process.
          The AS contains a database of which $ID sub c$'s may speak for
          which $UID sub c$'s. If the $ID sub c$ may speak for the $UID
          sub c$, two tickets are returned.
        UserProc->AS
                $AuthTreq, ~ CH sub s , ~ ID sub s , ~ DN sub s , ~ ID
                sub c , ~ UID sub c$
        AS->UserProc
                $AuthOK, ~ K sub c lbr AuthTc, ~ CH sub s , ~ UID sub c ,
                ~ UID sub s , ~ K sub n rbr , ~ K sub s lbr AuthTs, ~ CH
                sub s , ~ UID sub c , ~ UID sub s , ~ K sub n rbr$
          Otherwise an error message is returned.
        AS->UserProc
                $AuthErr$, 64-byte error string
          The user passes both tickets to the client's kernel using the
          fauth system call (see fsession(2)). The kernel decrypts the
          ticket encrypted with $K sub c$. If $UID sub c$ matches the
          user's login ID, the tickets are remembered for any subsequent
          attaches by that user of that file server session. Otherwise,
          the ticket is assumed stolen and an error is returned.
      Remote Execution
          A number of applications require a process on one machine to
          start a process with the same user ID on a server machine.
          Examples are cpu(1), rx (see con(1)), and exportfs(4). The
          called process replies to the connection with a ticket request.
        Server->UserProc
                $AuthTreq, ~ CH sub s , ~ ID sub s , ~ DN sub s , ~ xxx,
                ~ xxx$
          Here xxx indicates a field whose contents do not matter.
          The calling process adds its machine's $ID sub c$ and its $UID
          sub c$ to the request and follows the protocol outlined above
          to get two tickets from the AS. The process passes the $K sub
          s$ encrypted ticket plus an authenticator generated by
          /dev/authenticator from the $K sub c$ ticket to the remote
          server, which writes them to the kernel to set the user ID (see
          cons(3)). The server replies with its own authenticator which
          can be written to the kernel along with the $K sub c$ encrypted
          ticket to confirm the server's identity (see cons(3)).         UserProc->Server
                $ K sub s lbr AuthTs, ~ CH sub s , ~ UID sub c , ~ UID
                sub s , ~ K sub n rbr , ~ K sub n lbr AuthAc, ~ CH sub s
                , ~ 0 rbr $
        Server->UserProc
                $K sub n lbr AuthAs, ~ CH sub s , ~ 0 rbr$
      Challenge Box
          A user may also start a process on a CPU server from a non Plan
          9 machine using commands such as con, telnet, or ftp (see
          con(1) and ftpfs(4)). In these situations, the user can
          authenticate using a hand-held DES encryptor. The telnet or FTP
          daemon first sends a ticket request to the authentication
          server. If the AS has keys for both the $ID sub c$ and $UID sub
          c$ in the ticket request it returns a challenge as a
          hexadecimal number.
        Daemon->AS
                $AuthChal, ~ CH sub c , ~ ID sub c , ~ DN sub s , ~ ID
                sub c , ~ UID sub c $
        AS->Daemon
                $AuthOK$, 16-byte ASCII challenge
          Otherwise, it returns a null-terminated 64-byte error string.
        AS->Daemon
                $AuthErr$, 64-byte error string
          The daemon relays the challenge to the calling program, which
          displays the challenge on the user's screen. The user encrypts
          it and types in the result, which is relayed back to the AS.
          The AS checks it against the expected response and returns
          either a ticket or an error.
        Daemon->AS
                16-byte ASCII response
        AS->Daemon
                $AuthOK, ~ K sub c lbr AuthTs, ~ CH sub c , ~ UID sub c ,
                ~ UID sub c , ~ K sub n rbr$
          or
        AS->Daemon
                $AuthErr$, 64-byte error string
          Finally, the daemon passes the ticket to the kernel to set the
          user ID (see cons(3)).       Password Change
          Any user can change the key stored for him or her on the AS.
          Once again we start by passing a ticket request to the AS. Only
          the user ID in the request is meaningful. The AS replies with a
          single ticket (or an error message) encrypted in the user's
          personal key. The user encrypts both the old and new keys with
          the $K sub n$ from the returned ticket and sends that back to
          the AS. The AS checks the reply for validity and replies with
          an AuthOK byte or an error message.
        UserProc->AS
                $AuthPass, ~ xxx, ~ xxx, ~ xxx, ~ xxx, ~ UID sub c$
        AS->UserProc
                $AuthOK, ~ K sub c lbr AuthTc, ~ xxx, ~ xxx, ~ xxx, ~ K
                sub n rbr$
        UserProc->AS
                $K sub u lbr AuthPass, ~ roman "old password", ~ roman
                "new password" rbr$
        AS->UserProc
                $AuthOK$
          or
        AS->UserProc
                $AuthErr$, 64-byte error string
      Data Base
          An ndb(2) database file exists for the authentication server.
          The attribute types used by the AS are hostid and uid. The
          value in the hostid is a client host's ID. The values in the
          uid pairs in the same entry list which users that host ID make
          speak for. A uid value of * means the host ID may speak for all
          users. A uid value of !user means the host ID may not speak for
          user. For example:
        uid=!sys uid=!adm uid=*
          is interpreted as bootes may speak for any user except sys and
          adm.

If you're interested in getting Plan 9 in CD format:
Harcourt Brace & Co.
Plan 9 (full distribution on CD w/ source)
ISBN 0-03-017143-1
$367.50 + 8% s/h + state tax (8.25% in Tx)
Usualy takes 24 hours to setup an account with them. Apparently they don't
ship this through retailers.
When I called this morning for up to date info the  selection for
individuals and professional didn't work. Just select the operator option
and be done with it. I advised them their VRU didn't work correctly.
If you talk to EJ tell her thanks again.
If you just want to play then go to plan9.att.com and get the disk set
they offer for playing around. It lacks all source but it will install
a minimal system on an Intel box. Should work on most systems though I do
suggest that you use a SCSI based system.

@_subject: Don't shoot the messenger (Re: 1 Question to Dr. Froomkin...) (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
Ok. It's not just the US judicial system, include the executive and
legislative branches as well.
You propose speaking softly will resolve the issue? If so why speak at all
since that is the softest speech of all. Your position seems to be that if
a question is hard then it should be avoided because it might offend
the sensibilities? You propose that justice would be better served if
it were all masked in innuendo and euphamism?
Perhaps, that is no reason not to take them to task when they expound a
position using fallacious arguments. Further, Dr. Froomkin is a law
professor who *trains* future lawyers. If anyone should be held to task for
their actions and views it is those who are deciding what tomorrows world
will look like and the people charged with those decisions. There is a
fundamental ethical responsibility for conservatism and literalism in those
enterprises that simply isn't present in most other 'jobs'. We aren't
playing horseshoes or handgrenades - close enough is not good enough.
There is a fundamental difference between Lawyers, Doctors, & Soldiers and
the vast majority of other human endeavours. In short, they are given the
lattitude to decide events that directly and immediatley impact human life.
Engineers, Pilots, hamburger flippers, etc. are seldom in a position as a
matter of course of their practicing their vocation to decide whether a
person will live or die. Because of this exclusion from commen behavioral
limitations they should receive *less* latitude and trust in their actions
instead of more (which is what is happening today). Ulitmately, when a lawyer
fails in their duty to use *every* legal recourse a person sits in a room and
gets to listen to the hiss of cyanide drop into the acid. When these people
make a mistake there is no 'fixing' it. Sometimes "I'm sorry" just doesn't
cut it. It is entirely too important to be complacent or trust without
verification (thanks to Pres. Reagan for that one). The road to hell is
paved with good intentions.
We'll just have to agree to disagree here. If they take the job they take
the responsibility to answer for their actions to any and every citizen that
asks for it. However inconvenient, uncomfortable, or rude the question may
be posed because the *next* citizen they ask to trust them may be the one
asking the question. Never forget that but by the grace of God there go
If you want to trust your future to somebody who 'shuts down' because
somebody says "spin doctor bullshit" or strenously defends their views be
my guest. Me, I want a MUCH more mature and determined individual handling
me and my decendants future. I want to experience that strength of
conviction from them not a yellow streak.

@_subject: plan 9 features (Re: autonomous agents (fwd)) (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
I have been working on a potential distributed data haven model using the
Plan 9 architecture. I have finaly amassed enough machines where I can
actualy dedicate the i/o, process, and file servers on seperate machines.
The problem that I see for the immediate future is getting nodes that don't
happen to reside on my premises for additional testing in about a year. I
don't have a clue to how to get people to spend $400 bucks for the software
(which the ATT license prohibits from commercial use) *and* dedicate several
machines to the enterprise. But I'm not going to give up, maybe some folks
will volunteer just to do it...:)
I took the liberty of forwarding the man page for the auth() function to the
cpunks list. It describes the 56-bit DES based authentication mechanism. I
personaly don't care for DES so at some point I will be looking to replace
that mechanism with an alternative.
I also need to take some time and look at porting the Plan 9 file server
adapter for Unix to Win95/NT. Either that or I mount the file systems to a suitably enhanced Linux box and then export from there. This would imply
that the Win95/NT boxes need to be on the physical network of the Linux box
or else excessive opportunities for MITM attacks are present. Not that
simply being on the same network provides complete protection either. I hope
that OpenNT will provide enough Unix-like features to minimize the port
The Plan 9 mechanism also needs to be enhanced in such a way that besides
the access token involving encryption the actual transfer of packets are
also content encrypted. This has potential compatibility problems with
un-enhanced Plan 9 servers that I haven't had a chance to look at.
Once I have a system up and running it will allow non-Plan 9 systems to
access the resources by using what is called 'hand-held DES encryptors'.
Unfortunately, there is not a real description of how this is to be
accomplished in a real-world manner.
My hope is to have something available sometime this summer that will allow
folks to play with it at least in a limited way.
If you get the chance and have the resources you should look into at least
getting the Plan 9 documents. They're like $150 but call and verify that
price since I didn't this morning. Also note, there are now two releases
of Plan 9 floating around out there. The only distinction I am aware of is
one is the 'old' release and the current is the 'new' release. Don't have a
clue as to how to tell them apart or what compatibility problems will exist.
My best estimate is that in about a month I will have the resources to
install and begin developing the model. I am currently between employers (I
don't work at Tivoli-IBM anymore) so I'm job hunting in the Austin area
over the next few weeks. I'll make reports to the list on the results as I
manage to get results.
I don't know about Java on Plan 9, I'll look into it.
Take care.

@_subject: Talk of Banning Research into Human Cloning (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
Actualy, at least according to one episode of that show on TDC that Skully
form the X-Files hosts, there are several groups who are working on just
this thing. One female researcher has extended the life of worms (admittedly
a step or two from humans) by 7 times with no apparent effect. There was a
piece on CNN late last nite about some researchers discussing this as well.
Their estimate is that it would be at least 5 years before there would be
anything available on the open market.
There is also at least two groups working on growing specific organs. One
group (the one interviewed on the TDC show) is using plastic forms to grow
the organs in. They can apparently grow small samples of specific cells and
are looking at how to organize the growth of more complex structures such as
a kidney which would include blood-vessels and such.
I am sorry I don't know the name of the show. If somebody out there does
please speak up.
My prediction is that within 15 years there will be methods to extend human
life by at least a factor of 3 and techniques to replace every organ or
structure with the persons own cells (thus alleviating all tissue rejection
problems) through accellerated growth mechanism based on cloning in such a
way that cancer, accidents, etc. will become at best temporary tragedies.
In short, unless you get your head or entire torso squished there will be
methods to keep people alive for periods approaching 200 years. Further,
these techniques will be available through standard insurance via your
employer because they will be low cost (that's the nice thing about

@_subject: how to release code if the programmer is a target for coercion (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
Actualy they killed Bull before he could complete his Super-Gun design and
get it built. There is no point to be had in killing the designer after the
fact except to advertise their accomplishment except to prevent future work
by that person.
This seems to have worked with several of the programmers at The L0pht
(l0pht.com) because of their legal problems. Seems they now do work for the
DoJ and other groups in return the various charges that were pending against
them were dropped (or at least put on hold).
L0phtCrack is one of the major NT cracking/testing tools currently used by
folks. And no, I am not implying it has been compromised only pointing out
that because of the relationship of some of the programmers to law
enforcement it could have been. I am not aware of the exact timing of the
agreement, development, and release of the software.
Then everyone would want proof and if you couldn't produce it they would
simply label you a nutcase. You probably would have mysterious accident
after that sort of behaviour. Besides, even if you were to prove it - could
you trust the witness protection process?
If the agents could infiltrate the development team what keeps them from
mounting a mitm attack on the people doing the signing?

Isn't this going to increase latency and increase the likelihood of both
sureptitious attacks (I notice the request in newsgroup A and begin putting
my mitm requests in the other newsgroups - the odds being that I will get
the data and then forward to the original recipient with small changes) as
well as must plain missing the request?
Be shure to pay with cash and use an anonymous name and address. Considering
the cost of accounts this could be quite expensive. Many services do provide
the first 2 weeks free or similar features. I predict that should this model
be put into practice at a very broad level the ISP's won't give the free
trial-periods to anonymous accounts.
Is this going to be a live model or a VR relicant? If it is a live model
then it should be relatively trivial to determine that persons
identification and location. Another question that comes up is how many
strippers are going to participate in this if they know the consequences?
It's one thing to spend the night or a few weeks in the tank, a whole nother
thing to spend years in there.
These still have to show up in the actual packets and are open to sniffer
attacks. Also, the individual packets can be traced from router to router.
Lot's of blind alleys but you'll get there eventualy.
SWBT will currently sell T1 access to homes for as little as $214/mo. Would
you settle for $2,568/yr.? Note that this price doesn't include routing and
name resolution. I'm still (3 months later) trying to get SWBT to tell me
how much they will charge for this - they supposedly offer it but I have yet
to find an actual business office that support home delivery of service.

Actualy I am more interested in the why's and wherefor's of the actual
application and less in the theory. If the issue was only theoretical there
wouldn't be over a million people in US jails and the other various excesses
that are currently permitted. That is far from theoretical.
That is one of the problem with the current approach. The Constitution is
not taken to mean anything. A fundamental flaw, theoreticaly or practicaly.
It is considered a document written by a bunch of long dead guys with little
if any application for todays social structures.
I'm asking Dr. Froomkin whether he accepts the Constitution as the defining
document of the government (not just the courts which is implicit but
unstated in your various questions) of the United States. I apologize if the
question was unclear. I had intended to structure it in such a way that it
was absolutely clear - it is a yes/no question after all.
Why? Because I want to know. The answer would provide insight and might
provide further information for future strategies.
There is an old saying: Know thy enemy.

Morality is an individuals or societal groups beliefs of right and wrong.
Of course there is no more absolute right morality than there is a right
flavor of ice cream, this entire line of reasoning is a non sequitar. Ethics
is the issues of what is correct or permissible in relation to a particular
human activity such as scientific research or law.
When you use 'science' and 'morality' in a comparison you are in actuality
comparing apples and oranges. Science is related to *how* one does a
particular activity, it is not concerned in the least with *why* that
activity should (not) be done in the first place.
Science and its philosophy are *not* applicable to all areas of human
discourse anymore than the Bible is applicable as a methodology to study
quantum physics or aerodynamics.
Science isn't concerned with right, wrong, morality, etc. It *is*
concerned with a systematic way to ask questions in a *specific* area of
discourse. To apply science to religion is as much a disservice to science
and religion as it would be to try to apply it to art.
Exactly whose theory or principle of natural selection? At the current time
I am aware of several different theories that fit the data but which in many
aspects are mutualy exclusive. This is entirely too broad a statement to
have reasonable merit. We simply don't know enough about what is going on
with the processes of life to justify this sort of leap.
Natural selection isn't doing anything. It is a term we apply to a process
we observe occurring. That process seems to occur at several levels besides
just the genes.
I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that. We start with the base
pairs, which really are informationaly isolated from the codons which are
triplets of base pairs which form a 'word' in the genetic code. It is of
some import to realize that the genetic code itself is *not* dependant on
the actual mechanism of expression, in other words you can talk about
the genetic langauge without any reference to the base pairs themselves.
It is the codons that are important. There is a fundamental symmetry break
at that level. Each of the codons is mapped to one of 20 amino acids. Since
there are 4 bases arranged in 3's there are 64 combinations. This means
that for any particular amino acid there is more than one way to code
it. There are also several 'stop' codes which break the transcription
process as well.
That works equaly well as a definition of the cosmos. Keep this up and
you'll become a pantheist...;)
Oh boy...
Not all moralities or religions accept the premise of altruistic behaviour.
Further, if you look at the prisoners game, you actualy accrue more from
intermittent moral behaviour than from consistent moral behaviour. Human
morality has no place in any consistent theory of natural selection that
I have ever seen. Please explain how a moral theory as you propose will
increase the participants likelyhood for reproduction? Further, if you look
at primate research (both non-human and human) what you find is a tendency
for promiscuity in both sexes. Males tend to be 'in heat' at all times while
females (at least when they are just entering the mating group) tend to
follow a estrus or lunar based cycle. Recent studies of primates in Africa
have found that the previous theory that band members don't intermingle is
actualy incorrect. Upon extended monitoring they find that when the females
go into heat each month they sneak off and mate with outlying members of
other bands (who are usualy un-paired males). They intentionaly hide this
activity from their band mates because if caught they will face a physical
assault and potentialy death. This raises the question of whether chimps
have morality under your view because it is clearly a measure of right and
wrong. Are you willing to give chimps some sort of equal status to humans
as a result? Studies of human females find this same sort of behaviour in
the young just entering the mating pool. Studies find that young women tend
to wear more provocative clothing and explore non-familiar peer groups in
relation to their menstrual cycle.
Absolutely, unfortunately the fallicy with such an assertion have nothing
to do with the reasons you expound.
So being a scientist increases ones probability for mating? Please be so
kind as to offer some proof. Do scientist tend to have more offspring than
non-scientist? I think you will find that the actual studies show that the
more intelligent and well educated tend to have *fewer* children. This would
seem to run contrary to your hypothesis.

@_subject: how to release code if the programmer is a target for coercion (fwd) 
Sorry Ryan,
I'll need more context to answer this one. Would it be too much to ask for
more than a fragment of one sentence...:(
Forwarded message:
I've probably sent out somewhere in the neighborhood of 40+ messages in the
last two days, several have related to signing documents in different
contexts. I don't recognize this particular fragment. Sorry, I don't
memorize my traffic nor do I keep archives of it and I'm way to lazy to
go searching the cypherpunks archives at 2am.
I'm assuming this has something to do with the eternity server/black_net
discussion that has been going on. So I'll take a stab at it, not that it
may make any sense in the actual context ...
 - You generate the code and sign it
 - You deliver the signed code to a data haven server of some architecture
   (note that you don't know where it is or who runs it, I'll assume you
    use some particular usenet newsgroup as your drop point)
 - Somebody else comes along and sees a list of available items and selects
   yours (again through a usenet based request mechanism).
 - They receive the code signed with 'your' key and decide they want to
   verify the signing (through yet another usenet channel).
The problem with this model is in the second step. What is to keep them
from removing your signatory, moding the code, and then resigning it. If the
recipient desides they want to check the sign they have two choices:
 - select an anonymous key that has been previously stored on some sort of
   key server.
   (if they are running a eternity server blind they could be running a
    key server blind as well, it follows that at least some of the
    users of your software wanting to verify the signing will go to this
    server and hence have corrupted code, if we're using the usenet model
    this is even more likely since they could be running a feed point for
    other usenet feeds downstream and hence capture many if not all requests
    for the product, especialy if they were the only server to actualy
    carry a copy.)
 - contact you the author directly (I'm assuming of course you were silly
   enough to put a publicly available key directly traceable to yourself
   on it in the first place) in which case they simply intercede from a
   upstream tap and verify their request in your behalf.
In either case there is no guarantee that what comes off the server is
what you the source put on there. Hence the long term security of the key
is compromised. In particular, in the second case, since they already know
who provided the illicit data to the server there motive is clearly to
track the users. This breaks the anonymity of the data haven.
Implicit in a workable data haven model is the goal of both source and sink
anonymity. This means that any signed data on the server must provide a
mechanism for the user to verify the sign by access to a suitable key to
generate the appropriate hash and compare it to the one that the server
delivered. If they match you should have the correct unadulterated document.

Hi Ryan,
Thanks for the clarification. I've added a few issues that have occured to
myself and Doug Floyd (operator of the dh-l mailing list) during several
short discussions we've had over the last year.
Forwarded message:
If I understand this you mean to use the code itself as the key?
So you require all the eternity servers to use the same source? Doesn't this
imply at some point a single point of distribution and hence another point
of attack?
I am unclear as to what you mean by 'known target', are you refering to a
particular eternity server, the eternity server code itself, the document the
user is looking for, or the provider of the document? I suspect the provider
of the document. Doesn't the fact that you can't address issues of key
validity become an issue? How does this model handle key aging or do you
propose to leave the same keys out there for extended periods of time (ie
decades after your death)? Doesn't this extended lifetime represent a threat
to the validity of the keys since it provides mallet an exceptional period
of time in which to mount the attack? Especialy since nobody is checking the
It further seems to me that the main motive of most law enforcement is going
to be going after the user of the data the majority of the time since this
is much more time critical than knowing who provided the data. After all
simply knowing who did the original sourcing is not enough to remove the
problem after the fact. Eternity servers are after intended to be long lived
mechanism, this provides the authorities much time to follow the data and
analyze the network traffic. Wouldn't it be important to provide some sort
of delivery mechanism that provides a full encryption envelope around the
data until it is delivered to alice? I recognize this exacerbates instead of
alleviates the key server security issues.
Ah, ok. So we again are assuming everyone is using the same particular piece
of technology. In this model, would it not add security to the mechanism to
have the eternity server deliver the encryption software (ie PGP)? How does
this model handle the physical contact that is required in the PGP web of
trust? In particular how does it verify that the actual physical contact
Can you address the key distribution mechanism and how it addresses the
issue of a mallet producing their own key server with their own keys signed
sureptitiously by their own multiplicity of 'nyms? Do you see a group of
'Johny Appleseeds' roaming the country in person dropping little dolops of
signed keys off? Or, do you believe some sort of key verification service
will need to be generated that compares keys for individual 'nyms on the
various servers and publishes a list of keys that don't match (something
that would to my thinking be prime data for a data haven server). Doesn't
such a 'trusted' service have the same sort of 'user end' threats as the
eternity servers themselves?
Assume for a moment that mallet wants to monitor a particular alice. Alice
makes her request which goes through mallets tap. Outbound traffic is
uneffected so that the actual keys sent to the server are good. However, no
the return stroke mallet intercept the traffic, provides their own bogus
keys and signed document. How do you see alice finding a way to recognize
this? The threat with this model is that alice might be turned and therefore
condemn any co-participants in whatever activity alice is supposed to be
involved in (eg ingesting lettuce or leading a freedom cell in Burma)?
I agree with all the points but the last. When the cost becomes too high
(ie inconvenient) they simply won't use it. I just can't seem to grasp why
people would spend even more money (which would provide a flag via
monitoring of funds) to physicaly meet a group of others who they probably
don't know and therefore probably shouldn't trust at such a fundamental
I believe it is a fundamental mistake to have the key server inside the
eternity server, just as I object to anonymous remailers that provide such
service. The key servers should be on different machines to provide physical
independance & legal indipendance - these are long lived keys after all and
there is no reason architecturaly to put the keys at threat if the data
haven is at threat, and finaly technological indipendance - it should not
require a upgrade of the eternity software (and visa versa) to upgrade the
key server software.
Another issue that was raised previously, neither I nor anyone else
addressed it at the time, is this acceptance of latency of distribution.
Since we are talking about providing potentialy damaging documents (to who
is intentionaly left vague) doesn't this latency provide opportunities for
attack? Unlike a remailer network where it defeats traffic analysis in the
data haven model it seems like a perfect means to get the processing window to
actualy mount a trace.
Anyway, since I am still about 3-6 months from actualy implimenting any of
my own Plan 9 based (network level anonymity) model this is all conjecture.
Hope it provides at least a seed for something useful.
Ta ta.

Hi Dan,
Forwarded message:
A building once built doesn't change and it's a pain in the ass to change
the rooms and such. A general purpose stored program computer is
intentionaly designed to get around these limitations. Computers before the
stored program paradigm most certainly fit the building model however.
The OS provides a multiplicity of resources for me to use (purchase) at my
leisure? I don't think so, unless you want to model the user as the company
that loads the shelves. In a computer, unlike a store, each time I want to
use a jar of tomato paste (program) to build lasagna (job) I don't have to go
out and buy a new jar of tomato paste.
That one I'll buy (figuratively).

Forwarded message:
Where do these private access servers get/send their traffic ultimately?
So we have lots of little groups of remailers that are hidden from public
view by a 'ring' of public remailers (required if we want the general public
to access them)? By what mechanism do I as a 'secret' remailer let others
know about my existance and hence willingness to carry traffic? By what
mechanism is my trustworthyness to be judged for this secret duty?
Doesn't the remailer have to know who to ask to have a reasonable shot at
getting the pieces? Isn't the list of sources going to have to be publicly
accessible? Doesn't this also increase the bandwidth problem? Considering
the scale required to impliment this, where is the monetary pay off for
these secret remailers?
At least one current potential for income is the indipendant key server.
Charge some amount to keep the keys for a year and charge per access by
remailers since they would be commercial enterprises. If the cost were
pennies per access you could even access the casual individual user who
wants to pull a key (though I personaly would like to see this cost be born
by the key server operator).

Considering that the federal law enforcement agencies have had decades to
deal with organized crime and such over a national and even international
level, 100' level warrants is not even a resource strain if the pay off is
large enough. Now if we had 10,000 or 100,000 the picture begins to change
    8.  Operator incompetence
    9.  initial startup difficulties
   10.  lack of an effective financial model
This is another problem with the entire crypto process as now implimented.
Users of keys, either for encryption or signing, tend to think of the keys
as long term entities. Considering the increase in computing power, the
coming ubiquity of law enforcement monitoring on the network, increased
payoff for hackers as the traffic of personal info increases, and general
human failure keys should in fact be changed often (say a couple of times a
year, annualy at least)
These are all criticisms of the TCP/IP and associated network mechanisms and
not specific faults in the remailer model. It has to work with what it has.

There is at least one way to do it with standard equipment, course it must
be 1-way only. The source takes the phone line from their standard 4800
modem and put it in the audio in (both should be 600 ohm, be shure to use a
matching transformer for isolation). At the other end you do the same sort
of thing but use the modem to decode the data. You can not have full-duplex
with this method, half-duplex only.
Yeah, another radio, a map, a ruler & pen, a omni-directional antenna, and a
car. Check out the ARRL for various antenna designs.

We should also pick our treasurer with some care. It is the prime target for
law enforcement since it provides them access to the money records.
In general I have to agree with Adam though, in the real world with
ubiquitous and surreptitious monitoring signing documents is actualy a
liability in many if not most cases. About the only exception is dealing
with a contractual relationship.

EXACTLY. That is why there is a potential for a MITM (requires at least
3 parties) attack.
So what? If Alice is being monitored for whatever reason and she requests
your key Mallet simply intercedes and inserts their own key. How is Alice
going to catch a clue?
It isn't the source but the recipient that is under attack.

reading but rather what you were generating? Using Van Eck it would be much
easier and cheaper to determine what you were reading than spend the money,
physical resources, and people time to figure it using traffic analysis.
It's more incriminating to prove you sent a request for illicit data than
you downloaded it. Sending it out shows premeditated intent. Simply
downloading it shows only curiosity with no other evidence. Simple traffic
analysis will determine your sourcing data even if it is fully encrypted.
I point my local news readers at my ISP's news server so I don't flood my
link with several gig's of traffic a day. This is the primary objection to
hosting a 'real' local news server - the bandwidth and hardware resource
issues place it outside of most peoples financial ability.

That's all fine and dandy, however, we *are* talking about an eternity server
architecture that delivers documents to an end user in a secure manner on
demand with no mechanism, by design, to determine the original source. In
this case there would by definition be *no* history to verify against.
It is in fact this lack of history from the users perspective that causes
the authenticity problem in the first place. Further, a point that seems
to have been forgotten, we are talking about signed and not encrypted
documents. Of course there are some similar problems if we do include the
encryption of the data itself into the protocol.

Forwarded message:
How are these fundamently different? Assume for a moment that as a user of
an eternity server the source is the data I want.
The point I am making is that whether the author is corrupt or not is
Pretty expensive and rather unrealistic I suspect. Where does this random
user come from? What is '(thresh)'? What good would an anonymous key
signature provide? You can't verify it within the web of trust model, that
would imply the author wasn't anonymous which takes us back to the 'friends'
attack. How do we know that some number of these cypherpunks aren't turned?
Are you proposing that the user test all 100 of the signatures? Which
realisticaly is the only way to verify any given one of them. Not very many
people will go to that extreme simply for grins and giggles.
The standard is programs over ~10k lines is not comprehensible by a single
individual on a line by line basis.
'small compilation system' of what? What who wants it to do? The author?
Mallet? The end user?
It isn't the key of the author or the eternity server that is under attack
by Mallet. It is the security of the individual user who is under assault.
We're talking here about users who want to get data that is illegal or
otherwise incriminating or dangerous to one group or another. In particular
let's consider the situation of a Lebanese freedom fighter in Isreal or
perhaps a 'Free Burma' revolutionary in China.
Which doesn't effect the ability of Mallet to resign that code at the users
end in order to break the users local security.
[material describing script verification deleted]
Mallet can re-write said script, especialy with the sorts of latency that
the Eternity Server forces on the end user, such that it is consistent with
the bogus keys the end-user gets. It is simply much easier to write scripts
in a day than say 10 minutes.
The end user may not have people available to trust is the point. The reason
the transport mechanism is relevant is that it is much easier to spoof a
verification script if the user is not going to be surprised with 24 hour
turn around on requests, whereas a responce time measured in minutes lessens
the window of opportunity to Mallet significantly.
It may come as a surprise to you and others but not everyone in the world
can pick up a phone and call a 100 people all over the world and not raise
some suspicion.
While it is perfectly permissible to design Eternity or any data haven with
inherent key servers, I believe it is a bad idea from a design perspective
because it makes the code even larger, decreases the potential for monetary
motives for indipendant key servers to appear, and if the server is
compromised then the key server is also. It is more expensive if Mallet can
be forced to deal with two indipendenat operators then a single monolithic

Admiral Hopper used to give a talk about the worth of data and she had a
very nice chart that would demonstrate the worth of data over time. Initialy
it is worth a lot because it is hard to reproduce, obtain, or distribute. As
time goes on it becomes less and less important. In her particular context
it was related to the economic decision of when to move data offline in
large database applications.
That's a jump of logic. The data may infact be quite popular even though you
don't offer it anymore (might even do this in order to increase its worth, say some sort of insider trader newsletter). It's probably not in the best
interest of the data haven model to speculate on exactly why a particular
source decides to quit sourcing.
Then again, if it was really important I might intentionaly want to attack
the ability to provide long-term income. A better model might be to charge
for the access and let the actual submission be no charge. A portion of the
retrieval charge could then be piped back to the source. Consider the case
of say nuclear or biological information for a weapon. That sort of data
would be accessed only infrequently (unless you're giving something this
expensive to obtain and verify away - a d-h operator error, no.) but should
be quite expensive to retrieve.
More realisticaly they would have somebody just add it to a batch job and
let the spare cycles of the machines crank away at it. Or perhaps set up a
key challenge and get people all over the world to work on it in their spare
cycles. Who knows, perhaps the source of the data woudl be intriqued enough
to provide spare cycles unknowingly.
It's not just their sig-int capability but their complete processing
resource capability that must be considered as well as their psychological
motivation. Granted, all of these are extremely difficult to measure let
alone verify. Perhaps a little paranoia might be a good thing.

@_subject: Signed document - a thought... 
I was pondering the security issues regarding signed documents and key
security. It occured to me that in all the discussion it is assumed that the
document is transmitted after the key is transmitted.
It seems to be that a higher level of security could be obtained by
submitting the signed document first and then submit the signing key.
This way when the document goes out Mallet has no idea what key to replace
and any fudging of the document will destroy the sign. Then when the key
goes out if it is replaced the document won't pass testing either since the
server already has a unmod'ed copy.
In short, instead of having each author have a signing key, have each
document have a signature key and always submit the signed document prior
to the signing key. After all it's the document and not the author (who we
assume is already using an anonymous submission mechanism) we wish to verify
from the end users perspective.
The mechanims provides a means for the data haven server to verify the
authenticity of the document and this allows them to pass that trust on to
the end user in the same sort of way.

So in your model there isn't any form of check on the data for redundency?
Not if it's:
 \
This is a specious point. The fact is that from the users perspective the
index would automagicaly provide the actual resting place for the server
to find it, even if it were on a different server. The whole point is to
make the software do the druggery. The length of the pathname or URL is
irrelevant at that point.
The point being that if we take the average user of a data haven model they
don't have the resources (money, technical skill, bandwidth, etc.) to set up
a data haven of their own. Further, the storing of the data by other parties
isn't the issue, it isn't the data havens data. This is one of the primary
reasons that really important data should be expensive to get initialy. It
goes back to what I was saying in a previous post about Grace Hoppers
worth-v-time model.
What this over-looks is the potential for that data to become relevant to
some currently unknown situation in the future. While I agree that the data
should not necessarily be in a fast medium storage after a certain time
period it should not simply be thrown away. If nothing else at some point it
will have historical (inexpensive, it's still money) relevance.
Life costs money, that is one of the reasons that you don't want to throw
stuff away that may bring in income down the road.
There simply isn't a way around that except to out bandwidth the attacker.
I like it when you write my own rebuttal for me...:)
The bottem line is that the market mechanism *is* the willingness of some
party to buy that space. Nothing more, nothing less. Further, Mallet ain't
stupid or he'd have starved a long time ago.
The point is that *nothing* is given away for free, though you might want to
let people *give* you resources for free. Which is the point I was making.
The point is that the system can *always* be spammed. You *don't* charge the
source of data a million dollars to put it on your server. It's gotta be
source cheap or else it isn't worth their time to bother with it. If you
*really* want to promote such servers what you need is a model that allows
submitters free access *and* a share in the subscribers fees. Then everyone
If the source has something they know is worth god awful sums of money they
aren't going to submit it to the data haven anyway, they'll set their own
haven up and reap the benefits directly. There is an economic issue here
that is at parity with the technical issues.
Not really, at some point the complexity works against itself - you should
study a little chaos theory. The final point is to make the system (ie the
logical linking of black box operations that themselves may be quite
technical or complex) dirt simple.
Tell that to the NSA and their Cray-acres. The point is that even if you
have customer ASIC's or FPGA's or whatever these are still computers and you
can't seriously be suggesting that the resources to create customer hardware
for specific goals is any less complicated or more inexpensive than using
general purpose hardware when looked at from a global scale. If that model
were so generaly applicable then we should move all our processing jobs to
ASIC's and reap the benefits. There is also the issue that even if you use
customer chips to develop customer key cracking hardware (which I agree is
being done as we speak) there is still the inescapable fact that you will
need lots(!) of them. So the result is that whether they are custom or
general purpose devices the sheer quantity becomes a hinderance.
That would depend on the economics of startup and what kind of footprint
that would leave in the industry. This is one of the reasons that the NSA
builds their own chips.
My, my. Moral stipulations are probably no more relevant than psychological
classifications. The issue is one of emotion. Mallet wants it because it
benefits Mallet and hinders Mallets enemies. This is an emotional reason
and most definitely outside the bounds of simple rational/irrational action
classification. When I was speaking of psychology earlier in my submissions
I was not the least bit implying any comment on rationality, goodness, or
other relative classifications. I was refering to greed, pride, honor,
self-respect, etc. as motivations. The interactions of those in individuals
and organizations doesn't depend on classifications.
Any government can be subverted as well, happens on a regular basis. The
legal system may not need to be subverted for the simple reason that more
than one legal system may be involved. The front page example you are so
fond of is a instance that would take, my guess, probably in the
neighborhood of $10k to have a full page for a single day. To make the
participants investment in that sum worth it, what is their pay off in your
system? Just having their name in the paper probably isn't worth it. The
wide public advertisment, and hence notoriety is probably not a big plus
either. Especialy considering that it would guarantee the participant a nice
bug-for-life experience.
Whether the providers themselves are bugged are not is really irrelevant,
its the backbone infrastructure providers who are providing the access points.
You tap the satellite transfer point, for example, not the 300 organizations
sending data down it. You tap the telephone switch in each neighborhood, not
the individual lines on their subscriber end trunks.

It is clear that there are two diametricaly opposed models of payment
mechanisms and who those costs should fall on; producers or consumers.
I personaly have no faith in systems where the producers bear the burden of
the costs since they have no clear mechanism to obtain the funds to finance
the enterprise in the first place.
Imagine for a moment that a couple of persons come into possession of a set
of documents which would cause considerable political embarassment and legal
difficulties for a head of the local government.
Why should these two individuals pay to have their data dissiminated to
anyone who wants it? It certainly isn't going to improve their social,
political, or professional standing since the server will anonymize the
data. They then have two options, release it themselves and hope for the
best (and hence reap the benefit of any economic benefits that might acrue)
or do nothing with it.
How about information to build man portable atomic bombs? It doesn't make
sense to take all those chances and the data haven operators to take the
chances when they will get at most the monetary input from a *single* party.
It is clear that these resources are clearly inferior to many parties paying
to get the data.
I guess the question boils down to why the individual operator in running
the server in the first place. I assume a priori that the goal of both the
submitter and the operator is to make a reliable income from the users of
the service since there are clearly many more consumers of information than
producers of it.

Yes, at bargain basement prices that allow, if not even promote, a daddy

No, the source payment mechanism does not promote either server honesty

We're going round and round here, as I said earlier the views are

I suspect they'll wonder why that particular file is so much larger than

Look for the pixel that has the unique color mapped onto it.
And can't handle more than a few dozen colors and limited layering.

@_subject: NTY compression proposal 
It has been proposed to compress the keys from 100 cypherpunks down to a 64
character add in the NYT. Let's consider the math a moment to determine if
this is realizable.
Each key will require some sort of identifier, to make it simple lets assume
8 characters to identify the cypherpunks and 8 bytes to represent their key
(64-bits). This mean that each line will contain 16 bytes. With a hundred
entries that is 1600 bytes or 12800 bits.
Now 64 characters of text in a newspaper represents approx. 64 6-bit
characters (we can't use a full 8-bit because the paper doesn't normaly
support that many characters in normal text). This provides us with
384 bits.
The proposal leads to a requirement for an algorithm with an average
compression factor of:
12800/384 or 33.33:1 with no data loss.
That's a pretty hefty compression factor for average responce.
Is there a loss-less algorithm which provides this level?

The reason I addressed them is that they were what you brought up. Those
dainty decorations are critical to every industrial use of CAD that I have
ever been exposed to or used in an industrial setting. I'll have to disagree
with your opinion  on their utility.
Ok, let's address hatching from the perspective of use as a means to encrypt
data. Let's further use AutoCAD since it is by far the most used in
industrial settings. I think you will find that most other CAD programs use
one or more of the methods in AutoCAD.
AutoCAD offers a standard set of hatching objects via the HATCH and BHATCH
commands. In both cases the actual hatch patterns are 1-bit patterns meant
to be tiled. The HATCH command itself is normaly used for gross backgrounds
and such because it doesn't respect object boundaries. The BHATCH command
does respect object boundaries and is used much more in industrial and
machine drafting. In both cases the color of both the background and line
color must be specified. The hatching pattern is then simply tiled across
the appropriate area. It is possible to add other non-standard hatch
patterns but again, they are 1-bit deep and tend to be regular so there
isn't a lot of room to put data.
It is possible to include AutoLisp routines to do such hashing but I fail to
see how one would stego encrypted data in source code describing how to draw
the pattern.
There are two means to store reference to those patterns in a file. The
first is simply to include a pointer to a standard table of hash patterns
that every copy of the program will understand. I suspect that there isn't
much room there for stego. Now if we extend the standard hash table we are
required to include those hash patterns in our file and suitable coding to
tell the foreign program to include them appropriately. I don't see a lot of
room there for stego. The alternate is to include the actual hash pattern in
the file specificaly not linked to the hash table, in other words an
indpendant object we will manipulate through normal mechanisms. While I
will agree that if you could guarantee that Mallet didn't actualy view the
file as a graphic but rather as a file via some sort of character editor
(eg od -c or od -h as the simplest) there isn't much room for getting caught.
However, if you were to bring it up as a graphic and view it you find the
actual hash pattern is limited because it can be of only a particular size
for the hashing display and handling routines to handle.
CAD programs at their basest level understand a limited set of objects;
coordinate pairs, sets of such pairs for drawing lines, and color. Other
geometric objects (eg circles or hatches) are usualy built up through some
sort of algorithmic application of these basic objects. In the better CAD
programs those objects are routines that are shared as standard functions in
the program or through a cookie-cutter mechanism. The way new functions are
added is to add some form of PDL (eg AutoLisp) function. The cookie-cutter
mechanism usualy is limited by the 1-bit depth and the limited size of the
Let's look at the mechanism that most CAD and graphics programs use for
color manipulation. In very few programs that I have ever come across are
the colors of each pixel actualy represented by some depth that allows the
full range of colors for every pixel. In general some color map mechanism
that takes a limited set of colors (usualy arrayed in a table) and allows
the program to select a given color from that table. Such special effects as
color cycling are created by writing a program that dynamicaly changes the
color stored in each member of that table. This is very fast and allows
every pixel for a given color to change in concert instead of the delay of
having to go to every pixel and test its color and then change it; very
slow. The way that most programs allow more colors than allowed by a
given color table is they create some sort of interrupt for each line of the
dispaly when the display gets a retrace pulse. When this pulse happens (on a
1024 x 768 it occurs every 1/768 seconds - a long time by computer
standards) a routine changes the color map to the one appropriate for that
line of the display. Some higher performance displays use a d/a mechanism so
that each pixel on the display is addressible. These sorts of displays allow
the color map to be changed for each pixel but they are very expensive in
hardware and list price, both tend to limit the applicability to commen
stego exchange outside a limited group.

We are looking at selecting 100 64-bit keys out of a set of 2^64,
that is not a lot of opportunity there, given a random key generation
process, for a lot of commen patterns in the key set. If we don't have a
lot of commen patterns in the text we don't get a lot of compression.
In this case we can't afford any loss.
Which if we do the math requires something in the neighborhood of 33:1,
for a loss-less algorithm that's a pretty hurky boundary condition.
My point exactly, which would lead us to the conclusion that our requirement
of a 33:1 compression factor is not realizable.

Not at all. I even manage to use it well enough to make money selling my
own services now and again...
Exactly, which means we are left with two results. Either the source forgoes
the d-h completely, since they could dissiminate their data through a normal
anon remailer and usenet (for example) completely eliminating the whole
point of the d-h and the consequential payments - this reduces their
overhead considerably. Or they share the income through the d-h operator.
Now if the source has two halves of a clue to rub together their share will
include whatever money they paid the d-h operator in the first place - thus
eliminating the need for the source to have paid in the first place. Either
way the source ends up with the net effect they don't pay the d-h operator
for their services - the end user does. In only one case is there a economic
reason for the d-h to exist. Now if the goal of a d-h operator is to make
some income which model would you choose? From the source's perspective the
d-h model makes sense because it places two (not one) layer of anonymity
between them and Mallet. As a source, which model would you choose?
Either way you look at it, the end result is the end user pays the bills.
Why on earth are you assuming that is what I do? While I have sold dedicated
and intermittent dial-ups they in general have not been to the general
public and my customer base is not one that comes from general advertising.
At no point has it ever been a significant portion of my income in any case.
As a matter of fact I haven't advertised in any public forums. Don't know
where you get your data about me from but you really should go to the horses
mouth instead of some jackass. Your data would be much more accurate.

Which in general are a flat rate. I'll try to fill in the various issues you
raise with as real-world numbers as I can get.
Everyone who uses the system. The question is who do we want to define as
'using'. I believe the provider of information is not 'using' the system
in the strictest sense but rather making an investment of their time and
effort in somebodies elses business model and hoping that work will bring
them profit.
Assuming your 5 year plan, a 1G drive costs $100 or less. That's roughly
Granted, but except for the sys-admin you don't need them often. In all the
years I have been in business I've needed a lawyer only a couple of times.
Say $1k/lawyer-year.
A Cyrix P200 runs about $600 for a working box (I bought one just a few
weeks ago). So that gives us about $120/cpu-year.
For reliable system administartion you're looking at 5 people (3 8-hr.
shifts plus weekend coverage of 2 12 hour shifts). A sys admin with the
skills and maturity to work in this environment is going to run you in
the neighborhood of $40-60k/yr. So this means we're looking at, on the
outside, $300k/sysadmin-yr. This is the real cost of doing business.
Not shure what the normal ratio for online versus offline storage actualy
is currently, say 10:1.
This seems overly simplistic to me. The actual cost of the bandwidth is
reasonably fixed for a given site. Also if we throw in the other servers
this model becomes a bit more flexible. Remember, under the Eternity model
we don't know *which* server is being hit for the request. This means we
have to consider the actual end user costs in a much more complicated
fashion. It's one of the issue I'm working on myself. It does not seem clear
cut nor well researched at all.
I fail to see the profit in giving away plans for man portable nukes or to
turn commen cooking yeast into a THC producing horde when the various
groups around the world would pay so many millions (or would that be
billions) for some to get it and some to keep others from getting it. The
potential for a access auction hasn't been explored as far as I am aware.
I believe advertising would be a necessity. The question is how. Would the
payoff for doing a print ad in a magazine be worth it? Should it only
be advertised on the net?
If the Eternity model works the question becomes which one and where are
they located? Whose legal defense? Which jurisdiction? Put up an offer for 1
weeks notice of any pending legal actions against the network and make it
worth the while. Say $500M. It would of course be fully anonymous and the
information would have to be testable prior to payout. Leaves two option.
First, the data is verified and the source is paid. Second, the server
goes down and the source isn't paid - thus ruining the reputation of a
server. It isn't clear to me what the total impact would be on the network
as a whole. One way to mediate this impact on a given server would be to
share the cost of the payout between the various servers. It is after all in
all the servers best interest to keep as many going unharrassed and as well
prepared and for-warned as possible.
True, but the current model doesn't allow anonymous providers as the norm
either. The users may be anonymous but the ISP isn't.
Then there is no reason to use an anonymous network, simply put the data on
their own webpage and sell it direct, cut out the middle-man a tried and
true business tactic.
One of the assumptions is that the source, individual server, and sink
are all anonymous to each other as well as Mallet. Now we're changing the
rules of the game in the middle of the game. Apples and oranges.
If I were actualy going to impliment something like this I wouldn't even
consider it unless I had at least $500k worth of funding for each of the
first 5 years. That start up cost, $2.5M, is what is going to kill it.

Ooops, I needed to do some editing that I missed....sorry for the confusion.
I should have changed all those 4800's to 1200's. I couldn't remember which
one so I had picked one distinct from the example provided by ya'll and
missed changing it to the correct value per the references. I got sloppy.

First, I knew the answer, I was looking for a lead-in...thanks.
Then how, Constitutionaly speaking, do they have get the responsbility to
search when it is clearly a judicial responsibility (that is where it is
in the Constitution) and in cases such as Evans -v- Gore the Supreme Court
has found that the judicial body can't transfer or relinquish it's
responsibilities even if it *wants* to?
I suspect that, again Constitutionaly speaking, the only system that would
pass strict muster would be something similar to the Dutch which prohibit
the police from executing a search until *after* review by a legislative
This is a rhetorical question, I don't expect you or anyone else to

     The CCIPS is responsible for implementing the Justice Department's
     Computer Crime Initiative, a comprehensive program designed to
     address the growing global computer crime problem. Section attorneys
     are actively working with other government officials (e.g., the FBI,
     Department of Defense, NASA) the private sector (including hardware
     and software vendors and telecommunications companies), academic
     institutions, and foreign representatives to develop a global
     response to cyberattacks. These attorneys, who are responsible for
     resolving unique issues raised by emerging computer and
     telecommunications technologies, litigate cases, provide litigation
     support to other prosecutors, train federal law enforcement
     personnel, comment upon and propose legislation, and coordinate
     international efforts to combat computer crime.

   A. Federal Guidelines for Prosecution of Violations of Intellectual
   Property Rights
   (Copyrights, Trademarks and Trade Secrets)
     The importance of the protection of intellectual property to the
     economic well-being and security of the United States cannot be
     overestimated. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
     wrote the attached manual to assist law enforcement in the
     investigation and prosecution of violations of federal criminal
     copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws. Section I of the manual
     contains an overview of the protection of intellectual property, and
     discusses the basic scope of copyright, trademark, and trade secret
     and patent law. Section II focuses on intellectual property entitled
     to copyright protection and Section III describes the applicability
     of various federal criminal statutes to copyright infringement.
     Section IV addresses the prosecution for trafficking in counterfeit
     goods under 18 U.S.C. � 2320. Section V discusses the prosecution of
     trade secret thefts and analyzes the recently enacted Economic
     Espionage Act of 1996. Finally, Section VI contains a list of
     contact persons, model indictments, search warrant affidavits, jury
     instructions, state criminal trade secret statutes, and the
     legislative history of the Copyright Felony Act and the Economic
     Espionage Act of 1996.

   B. Operation "Counter Copy"      In early May, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
     Investigation released the first results of a nationwide law
     enforcement effort to crack down on trademark and copyright fraud,
     which is estimated to cost American businesses millions of dollars
     each year and cheat unsuspecting consumers who purchase counterfeit
     products. As a result of the joint effort, called Operation "Counter
     Copy," 35 indictments were returned since the beginning of April for
     copyright or trademark infringement. More information about
     Operation Counter Copy, including a press release and brief
     summaries of the cases, are available via the links below.

     The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section is also charged
     with evaluating all requests for approval of charges under the
     Economic Espionage Act and making a recommendation regarding the
     approval of such requests to the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney
     General, or Assistant Attorney General. In addition, the Section
     also prosecutes certain Economic Espionage cases directly.
     Four Pillars Case
     One well-publicized case currently being prosecuted by the Section
     involves the alleged theft of trade secrets by the Four Pillars

  IV. ENCRYPTION AND COMPUTER CRIME
     _________________________________________________________________
     The nation's policy on encryption must carefully balance important
     competing interests. The Department of Justice has a vital stake in
     the country's encryption policy because encryption may be used not
     only to protect lawful data against unauthorized intruders, it may
     also be used to conceal illegitimate materials from law enforcement.
     While we support the spread of strong encryption, we believe that
     the widespread dissemination of unbreakable encryption without any
     accommodation for law enforcement access is a serious threat to
     public safety and to the integrity of America's commercial
     infrastructure. Our goal is to encourage the use of strong
     encryption to protect privacy and commerce, but in a way that
     preserves (without extending) law enforcement's ability to protect
     public safety and national security. Accordingly, the Administration
     has promoted the manufacture and use of key recovery products, aided
     the development of a global key management infrastructure ("KMI"),
     and liberalized United States restrictions on the export of robust
     cryptographic products. We anticipate that market forces will make
     key recovery products a de facto industry standard and thus preserve
     the balance of privacy and public safety that our Constitution
     embodies.
    A. Letter from Attorney General Janet Reno and others to Members of
   Congress regarding law enforcement's concerns related to encryption
     On July 18, 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno and others sent a
     letter to Members of Congress outlining law enforcement's concerns
     about the public safety and national security threats posed by
     unbridled availability of strong encryption. It urged legislators to
     support a balanced approach that supports commercial and privacy
     interest while maintaining law enforcement's ability to investigate
     and prosecute serious crime. This letter was co-signed by:
     * Louis Freeh, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation
     * Barry McCaffrey, Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
     * Thomas A. Constantine, Director, Drug Enforcement Administration,
     * Lewis C. Merletti, Director, United States Secret Service

  V. INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTER CRIME
     _________________________________________________________________
   With the explosive growth of the Internet worldwide, computer crimes
   increasingly are prone to have international dimensions. Some of the
   challenges faced by law enforcement on the international front
   include: harmonization of countries' criminal laws; locating and
   identifying perpetrators across borders; and securing electronic
   evidence of their crimes so that they may be brought to justice.
   Complex jurisdictional issues arise at each step. The Department of
   Justice is working with foreign governments through many channels to
   address global threats related to computer crime. A. Attorney General
   Janet Reno's speech to Senior Experts representing the G-7 on January
   21, 1997    On January 21, 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno spoke to Senior
   Experts representing the G-7 group of leading industrialized nations
   (now, with the inclusion of Russia, known as The Eight). The Attorney
   General's speech addressed the challenges presented to law enforcement
   by hightech and computer criminals, and she suggested a number ways in
   which the United States and its allies can respond to this global
   threat. Her speech is available via the link below.

     Coordination among prosecutors in high-tech crime cases has improved
     dramatically because of the implementation, since January 1995, of
     the "Computer-Telecommunications Coordinator" ("CTC") program. Under
     the CTC program, each United States Attorney's Office, as well as a
     few other Department entities, has designated at least one Assistant
     U.S. Attorney to serve as a CTC, with a few distinct areas of
     responsibility. To reach a CTC, contact the Computer Crime and
     Intellectual Property Section, or the U.S. Attorney's office in a

     on Consumer Information Privacy and its Data Base Study. The
     Department is deeply concerned about the safety and security of
     American citizens. The Department is vigilant to take appropriate
     measures to guard their privacy while using all the resources at its

We spend quite a bit of money on it that is for shure. I believe we have
like 5 or 6 channels currently. I worked on a program for access television
a few years ago doing post production, video processing, and audio
sweetening. It was a soap opera that we filmed in a local retirement home
and even won an award at some contest in England. It was called 'Silver
Time'. The cool thing is that anyone can go down and by taking a couple of
4 hour classes put their own show on. Because I know the person who does
their technical support via contract through one of my customers (CVS)
they'll let me go in and play around for free. They have some quite
professional equipment, Raptors and several non-linear editing decks as
well as a bunch of Amiga Video Toasters and such. That experience is one of
the reasons I ended getting my own Toaster. The hard drive of which failed
and I have spend the last few evenings, between answering your traffic,
rebuilding. It finaly came back online yesterday and I think I've just about
got it all rebuilt software wise.

and occassionaly puts on his own video game review production. We had hoped
to do a 30 minute 'state of crypto today' show but we never could get the
momentum going.

Ask one of your friends with a fireplace to help out. Just remember to stire
the ashes when done. Otherwise it's possible using IR sensing to read the

Is the additive to the paper alcohol soluble? If so soak it in alcohol for a

I have Igor, works pretty well for some paper additives. If it's a plastic
base then use finger nail polish remover or model cement thinner.
How in the hell can you say with a straight face burning paper with alcohol
is any more a fire hazard then burning paper? You don't burn the paper while
it's in the alcohol bath, but remove it and then burn it. If you try to burn
it in the bath what you get is just like gasoline. The fumes burn not the
alcohol itself so the paper doesn't get nearly hot enough to do any good.
You're making burning paper, additives or not, a lot more complicated than
it is.
If you're that worried about it go down to your hardware store and buy a
hand-held torch. Additives or not that will burn it.
Good luck.

 compliant ISDN products.  ""What is not widely known is that built in
 to the international CCITT protocol is the ability to take phones
 'off hook' and listen into conversations occurring near the phone,
 without the user being aware that it is happening."  Seems like an
 awful lot of CP using ISDN gear should beware.  Many ISDN devices are
 firmware based.  Might this not spawn a number of good crack projects
 to remove this feature from popular products.  I use an Ascend P25.
  The docs say its CCITT compliant.  Sooo does it enable this form of
 surveillence?  Enquiring minds want to know.
All phones can be forced to do this. Even POTS. It's a commenly known
'feature' by most folks in the telecom industry for the last 30+ years.
Commen defeat is to leave the phones unplugged or place them next to a
radio or television. Then if you want to have a secure conversation
go to another room, or better yet take a long walk in your neighborhood
at low-traffic times.

Go down to your local security or electronics supply (not Rat Shack) and
you should be able to buy a polarized loupe and see it directly.
If it has any N in it then don't burn it in a closed space otherwise you
will get various xCN compounds. These are very toxic, KCN is Potassium Cyanide.
In general you don't want to burn most plastics in closed spaces or be
downwind because they do give off various toxic chemicals. You can check
with your local fire dept. and they can provide references on the plastics
used in television cases, 3.5 floppy covers (v the disk itself), video tape,
etc. and the sorts of gases they give off.
When my house burned 3 years ago both my cats were killed because of smoke
inhalation (approx. 9 computers and bunches of other plastics went up). It
was not a pretty sight. Congealed blood from lung eruptions on their lips,
very blue tinge to the skin, etc. Not a pretty sight.
If you're smart avoid burning plastics except under very controlled

I was in a discussion with several people regarding the rate if improvement
of current video production equipment and how it would effect the veracity
of video images of all sorts in future legal cases.
Is anyone aware of anybody working on a mechanism to digitaly sign video and
photographs (a cool app of stego I suspect)? This would alleviate a great
deal of mistrust for security video cams and such. What I had in mind was
the manufacturer puts a unique key in each machines rom's and when each
image comes in a signature of the image and the key is stored in the
interframe retraces that are normaly not shown (ala videotext). I asked a
couple of people in the biz that I know and it seemed a new concept to them.
Just a thought...

Hi, It took a few minutes to find one, but below is just one of the many
standards that are implimented for plastic uses in the home that make
reference to minimal levels of HCN in particular.
Despite what some folks would like you to believe, plastics in conflagration
are *NOT* safe to inhale even in small quantitites because of these gases.
Note that I edited a bunch of lines out for brevity.

Ad hominims, opinions, and no proof...
I have forwarded to the list a single safety standard for plastics and fires.
It *specificaly* mentions HCN, so apparently it not only can happen but does
often enough they want to test for it on a national level. There are many
more out there and as I said before, if you contact your local fire dept.
they can provide you with documentation as well.
Sulfur dioxide is present and does pose a threat, fortunately it's a rather
short termed threat and treatable. Sulfur dioxide turns into sulphuric acid
in the water of the body. Not to mention it burns up the oxygen in formation.
The biggest threat with the acids that are produced in a fire is to your
possessions. They soak this stuff up and then when the firemen put the fire
out they use water which creates acids. These acids effect the components of
your possessions over an extended time.
Depends on the molarity. It is nowhere near as toxic as cyanide on a per
part basis.
Actualy most smoke inhalation deaths occur because of lack of oxygen and the
elevated temperatures. The actual clogging process would take much longer
than the 2-3 minutes most smoke deaths take to occur.
As to cats hiding, they tend to hind *under* furniture which is actualy the
*safest* place to be, the clearest air is next to the floor. It was also
where my cats were found, in the living room under the couch where the smoke
very clearly never got below about shoulder height - it stains the walls
quite well. The fire didn't even make it into that part of the house, it
stopped in the next room. The fire itself burned for less than 20 minutes
total because the neighbor saw it about 5 minutes after the person who
accidently set it off had left. The fire station was on the next block.
It was very quick. The firemen were very careful to explain to me exactly
why the cats died, gases from the plastics (HCN was specificaly mentioned)
and the temperature of the air (they estimate over 350F). While not enough
to cause spontaneous combustion it is more than enough to cook the lungs.
The air was hot enough that several plastic bags holding wargame materials
within 1 ft of the floor were melted but the paper materials were not even
scorched. This would further indicate that the damage was done by the
temperature of the gas and not direct flame or smoke.
The leads on most components are an aluminum compound (my background is EE)
and they typicaly don't start to burn until well over 800F, aluminum itself
burns at 600. Since typical tip temperatures in soldering (lead eutecticts
only - not indium composites) are in the 600 to 700 it is clear that pure
aluminum would not be desirable. So they mix tin and other compounds with As to electrolytics, the liquid plastics that make up the dielectrics are
very toxic and most certainly give off xCN compounds when burned.
Just for the record, Lead (the element) is not generaly used in modern
electronics except in a eutectic solder mix for connections. I have several
computers that were burned in the fire and the majority of the solder on the
pcb's was *not* evaporated. In most cases it wasn't even melted even though
the case was completely gone (2 A1000's that work fine though the cases were
completely destroyed by the temperature of the air, not fire).

Forwarded message:
Had DEC not been bought this is exactly (IMO) what would have happened.
Unless my info is seriously off DEC is already shipping 500MHz Alpha's and
has 1GHz chips in test. DEC historicaly has been way ahead of Intel (say a
year or so which in this business is a lot) and I don't see any reason to
suspect that to stop. A comparison of base technology between Intel and DEC
leads me to believe DEC is ahead a good margin. Intel won because of the
price (DEC has historicaly been very expensive) and support of MS and IBM.
(remember, nobody ever lost their job for buying IBM)
The only question I have is whether MS will continue to produce a HAL for
WinNT 5.0 or whatever they call it. That could put a serious crimp in
Compaq/DEC and would most definitely spawn a new round of lawsuites.
Had you realized that when we break the 1GHz barrier it won't be safe to
operate these machines without the cover on them? It'd be like breaking the
inter-lock on your microwave.

Isn't signing the document at least in theory a participatory creative act?
If you don't sign it then it doesn't exist in the same context as if you do.
Otherwise why have the signature? If I use a camera to sign a digital image
am I not stating that I have viewed and consented to the image being a valid
representation of what the lens saw? Seem quite similar to me.
A mechanism to sign a digital image would provide some base protection
against altering the image surreptitously, just as why you sign (and get a
copy) of other documentary evidence.

I have owned Intel and DEC machines since the late 70's. I started out on a
DEC PDP 8e in 1976 a friend game me when I was in high school and bought a
S-100 Intel 8080 machine about a year later. Since that time I have owned
80186, 80286, 80836, 80486, and Pentium machines as well as PDP 11/03,
PDP 11/23, PDP 11/34, & MicroVax II. Given a comparison by date the DEC
machines have had a higher clock frequency and generaly been a generation
or so ahead of Intel in the capabilities of the hardware. Further, the
operating system architectures available on the hardware, until the last
6-8 years anyway, also went to DEC when it came to scalability and usability.
The fact that NT was available on both the Intel and Alpha architectures
pretty much at the same time makes any further comparison moot except for
market share (which I alluded to the main forces in an earlier post). Unix
was available on the DEC architectures LONG (what, 20 years?) before it every
even thought about being put on a Intel cpu.
Then why isn't the Intel cranking at 500MHz now like the Alpha? Why is every
market comparison for the chips shows the DEC staying ahead of the Intel in
base clock frequency (I won't even get into architecture efficiencies) for
the next 5-8 years?
I bet now that Compaq has given them the sorts of resources they had to go
head to head with IBM from the late 60's to the early 80's that could change
pretty quickly, even considering the multi-billion dollar start-up costs of
modern fabs.

I was exchangin idea with a couple of members off-list and an idea came to
me about how to time stamp the frames. It would require a minor modification
to the WWV transmission but it wouldn't be much. Have the WWV transmitters
sign each 'tick' of the clock and have a WWV receiver in the vcr. This would
allow time stamping the frame with a signed reference that could be checked.

The fact that it's hard is what makes it worth doing in some environments.
The goal is to provide a reasonable doubt as to the validity of the picture
on the tape.
Don't know about cost and power consumption...but this is where I'm at
on this issue now, by no means is it fully worked out:
The actual signal on the tape can be mapped to a specific head mechanism
using the same sorts of technology that is used to identify specific cell
phones from the rf signature. So we can do an analysis of the signal and
verify if a given camera striped the tape. Hysterisis, amplifier slew rates,
power spectrum analysis, etc.
The pattern of wow and flutter of any motor and drive mechanism is unique
and can also be mapped to a specific mechanism. This wow and flutter creates
regular and repeatable irregularities in the pattern on the tape. This
allows us to match a drive mechanism to a specific program on a tape.
Irregularities in the drive wheel will cause specific pattern in the way the
stripes are laid down (ie wiggles in the same place each time that part of
the wheel comes around).
Irregularities in the syncronizing clocks in the tape mechanism can be
traced to particular oscillators (usualy slew rate as a function of
frequency stability).
By signing the frames with a signed time reference we can verify which clock
was used, though we can't verify that it wasn't recorded and played back at
a later time. We can at least verify the tape wasn't stiped prior to the
claimed time. For security applications this could be quite useful.
So if we have a fully analog system there are several means to test the
various parts of the systems to verify source veracity. We can also test the
tape recording mechanism even on a digital or hybrid system.
So let's look at hybrid systems where the video signal is source digital or
is digitized in the camera (for special effects, etc.).
If a frame isn't signed we don't trust it.
So we have a camera with a ROM that has a signature. We could replace the
code in the rom and keep the signature. If the owner doesn't replace the ROM
prior to testing then we can easily verify the ROM and it's signature don't
match. We don't even need the signature to do this, simple comparison
between the rom that should be there versus the one that is present is
If they do replace the ROM then we have a frame that is signed but potentialy
modified prior to the d/a conversion process. The question is can we in fact
identify such non-linear editing? If the answer is no then there is a clear
reason to suspect the validity of any video source that went through any
sort of digital processing.
I suspect the answer is no since this question is equivalent to signing a
document that was modified prior to the signature being placed on it. The
signature process only signs what was fed into the algorithm and can't
detect changes to the document prior to the signing.

The question was asked why mixing acids and bases are hazardous. Please
note number 5 below. When an acid and base are mixed you get water and a
salt. When water is added to acid (ie pouring a base into an acid) the heat
of reaction can cause the water to get quite hot and cause the chemicals
to splatter upon you. The idea is you want the acid to disolve in the water
and not the other way around. Goggles, bibs, and all other reasonable safety
precautions should always be used.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 356 January 27, 1998   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein
LOCALIZATION OF LIGHT has been achieved by an Amsterdam-
Florence collaboration (contact Ad Lagendijk, adlag at phys.uva.nl). Consider the movement of light through a  diffuse medium such as
milk, fog, or sugar.  The light waves scatter repeatedly, and the
transmission of light decreases as the light gets reflected. In the
Amsterdam-Florence experiment something different happens.  By
using a gallium-arsenide powder with a very high index of
refraction but with very low absorption at near infrared (wavelength
of 1064 nm), the researchers were, in a sense, able to get the light
to stand still.  That is, the light waves get into the medium and
bounce around in a standing wave pattern, without being absorbed. This is the first example of "Anderson localization" for near-visible
light.  This medium is not what would be called a "photonic
bandgap" material (analogous to a semiconductor for electrons) but
more like a "photonic insulator." (Wiersma et al., Nature, 18/25
December 1997; see also QUANTUM EVAPORATION occurs in a new experiment when a
beam of phonons (little pulses of sound issuing from a warm
filament) inside a pool of superfluid helium-4 is aimed at the liquid
surface from below.  In analogy with the photoelectric effect (in
which light ejects electrons from a surface), the phonons pop helium
atoms up out of the liquid.  By measuring the momenta of the
phonons and the evaporated atoms, one can determine that the
atoms originally had zero momentum parallel to the surface,
demonstrating directly (for the first time) that the He-4 atoms had
been part of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which the atoms
fall into a single quantum state.  Theories of superfluid He-4 had
supposed that the atoms reside in a BEC state, but this had not been
experimentally verified until now.  The researcher, Adrian Wyatt
of the University of Exeter,  believes this method can be used to
generate beams of coherent helium atoms (an "atom laser" effect). (Nature, 1 January 1998.)
ANOTHER VERSION OF QUANTUM TELEPORTATION is
being published by researchers in Italy and England (Francesco
DeMartini, University of Rome, demartini at axcasp.caspur.it).  Like
the Innsbruck teleportation scheme published several weeks earlier
(Update 351), this demonstration employs a pair of entangled
photons.   Whereas the Innsbruck experiment teleported the
polarization value of a third, distinct "message photon" to one of
the entangled photons, the Rome scheme encodes one of the
entangled photons with a specific polarization state and transmits
this state to the other entangled photon. Although different from the
Innsbruck experiment (which had a 25% teleportation success rate)
and the original theoretical proposal for teleportation, this scheme
works 100% of the time if the receiver applies the right
transformations on the second photon. (D. Boschi et al., upcoming
article in Physical Review Letters).  In another, theoretical paper,
Sam Braunstein of the University of Wales (Bangor) and Jeff
Kimble of Caltech propose an experimental method for extending
quantum teleportation from transmitting discrete variables such as
polarization to transmitting continuous variables like the amplitude
of the electric field associated with a light wave. (Braunstein et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett., 26 January 1998.)

As I understand the process you don't get around the speed-of-light issue
because the control channel still needs to be sent via radio or laser or
whatever. This was discussed in the in the original teleportation
announcement. However, I don't see anything that would keep you from syncing
two atomic clocks and then using them to make the changes in sync, this
should allow the imposition of the speed of light only on initiation and
occassion syncronization. I'll have to beg ignorance on specifics as I
haven't had the time to really dig into specifics. I haven't even read the
primary references to date.
Agreed. It would also solve many terrestrial problems as well.
True, but it would be boring compared to being there first person. I do
support robot exploration as a precursor to manned exploration.
there' as well as from satellites are circularly polarized. This is the
reason that the antennas have those curly-ques on them (look like a
cork-screw sorta). The last time I even messed with extra-terrestrial
signals was the SL-9 impacts. I worked with several amateur groups using plane
(flat rectangular) loop antennas to measure the increase in the background
noise in various bands (we used a HP spectrum analyzer at my site) during
the impacts. What we saw was a 'jump' across the band of several db's just
at the time-of-flight times we expected. The assumption being this was
caused by the impacts. We monitored 1MHz to 10MHz. I found it pretty
impressive. We got, if memory serves, around 6 of the large impacts.
I'll have to disagree, all forms of E-M radiation that I am aware of are
polarized to some frame of reference. The E-M fields after all are
orthogonal. The question is which field you want to pick as a reference
and the relationship of source to sensor. Circularly polarized (ie the
fields rotate around the axis of transmission at some rate) are about the
only sort that would appear essentialy the same irrespective of reference

The actual transportation of the state is instantanious as it must be by
quantum theory, just as the change in orbits of an electron occurs instantly.
However, the catch is that the command/synchronization channel must be
sent in parallel and it at some point can't use the quantum transportation
technique and hence the speed-of-light comes back into play. This was
specificaly discussed in the original quantum transportation announcement
sent out by AIP.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 350 December 10, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
QUANTUM TELEPORTATION has been experimentally
demonstrated by physicists at the University of Innsbruck (Anton
Zeilinger, 011-43-676-305-8608, anton.zeilinger@ uibk.ac.at; Dik
Bouwmeester, Dik.Bouwmeester at uibk.ac.at).  First proposed in
1993 by Charles Bennett of IBM (914-945-3118), quantum
teleportation allow physicists to take a photon (or any other
quantum-scale particle, such as an atom), and transfer its properties
(such as its polarization) to another photon--even if the two photons
are on opposite sides of the galaxy.  Note that this scheme
transports the particle's properties to the remote location and not the
particle itself. And as with Star Trek's Captain Kirk, whose body
is destroyed at the teleporter and reconstructed at his destination,
the state of the original photon must be destroyed to create an exact
reconstruction at the other end.  In the Innsbruck experiment, the
researchers create a pair of photons A and B that are quantum
mechanically "entangled": the polarization of each photon is in a
fuzzy, undetermined state, yet the two photons have a precisely
defined interrelationship.  If one photon is later measured to have,
say, a horizontal polarization, then the other photon must "collapse"
into the complementary state of vertical polarization.  In the
experiment, one of the entangled photons A arrives at an optical
device at the exact time as a "message" photon M whose
polarization state is to be teleported.  These two photons enter a
device where they become indistinguishable, thus effacing our
knowledge of M's polarization (the equivalent of destroying
Kirk).What the researchers have verified is that by ensuring that
M's polarization is complementary to A's, then B's polarization
would now have to assume the same value as M's. In other words,
although M and B have never been in contact, B has been imprinted
with M's polarization value, across the whole galaxy,
instantaneously. This does not mean that faster-than-light
information transfer has occurred. The people at the sending station
must still convey the fact that teleportation had been successful by
making a phone call or using some other light-speed or
sub-light-speed means of communication. While physicists don't
foresee the possibility of teleporting large-scale objects like humans,
this scheme will have uses in quantum computing and cryptography. (D. Bouwmeester et al., Nature, 11 Dec 1997; see also
 DO EARTHQUAKES HAVE ELECTRICAL PRECURSORS? The
elastic waves measured by seismometers are transmitted by the
flexing crust while an earthquake is doing its worst.  But some
scientists believe that flexing also goes on in the hours and even
weeks before a quake.  Too small to be detected seismically, the
flexing might well be sensed electrically.  As underground strata
rearrange themselves before a quake, the thinking goes, pockets of
water are squeezed into new configurations, changing local
conduction properties, which can be monitored with buried
electrodes. On this basis Panayiotis Varotsos at the University of
Athens (011-30-1-894-9849, pvaro at leon.nrcps.ariadne-t.gr), has
reportedly predicted certain quakes in Greece weeks ahead of time
by triangulating voltage differentials at the level of 10 millivolts/km
over distances of 100 km. (Some skeptics dispute this assertion.) In new research, Varotsos buttresses his claims with laboratory
studies of another system under pressure which puts out transient
electrical signals before it fractures, namely a crystal containing a
variety of dislocations and defects. Conductivity patterns in the
crystal convince Varotsos that analogous patterns (although on a
much bigger distance scale) observed in the buried electrode arrays
constitute a true earthquake precursor.  (Varotsos et al., Journal of
Applied Physics, 1 Jan, 1998; journalists can obtain the paper from
physnews at aip.org.)

Actualy, if we are talking about instantanious events the event itself is not
frame relevant, thought exactly when and where the event occurred may be.
Consider an electron when it changes orbitals does so in zero time. So the
question that the photon was emitted is not at issue, now where that photon
came from and at what clock tick may in fact be.

up about how information worth/accuracy goes down with time. A proposal was
made that I thought might be of some interest as a base for discussions of
data havens and how to treat the relative worth of information.

What do you mean 'shortly before', the collapse is instantaneous. There ain't
no time to send anything. The channle can carry one bit of data, the
collapse has occured (1) or it hasn't (0). It isn't like a modem, CD, or
other comm channels where you have a bandwidth and can piggy back signals
for synchronization by using parts of that bandwidth.

True, but your opening your cookie does not *force* Lucky to open his at the
same time. This is one fault with this model. The 'state' of the cookies are
not inter-dependant as the polarization of the photon pairs are.
It isn't instantanous, the correlation existed when they were printed and
doesn't change. If I destroy one of the cookies it doesn't destroy the other
spontaneously as would happen in a correlated photon-pair. The state of the
individual cookies exists because of the observer and not a fundamental
requirement of the cookies existing.
On this we can agree.
Incorrect. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that in order to
measure one parameter the other must *necessarily* change because they are
in actuality different aspects of the *same* characteristic. They are *not*
indipendant aspects of the system being observed. Momentum and position are
different sides of the same coin. A conservation effect is what we are
dealing with. This same conservation issue arises, and in fact allows
FTL state transitions, with bound photon-pairs.
Not quite. In the act of measuring one parameter we necessarily change the
other. That change is what we can't measure *at the same time* not the
absolute value at a given time tau.
Only if the light has a single polarization. If you shine a circularly
polarized light through you will in fact see light on the other side.

       QUANTUM COMPUTATION: A TUTORIAL COOL CENTRAL SITE OF THE HOUR    Samuel L. Braunstein   Abstract:
   Imagine a computer whose memory is exponentially larger than its
   apparent physical size; a computer that can manipulate an exponential
   set of inputs simultaneously; a computer that computes in the twilight
   zone of Hilbert space. You would be thinking of a quantum computer.
   Relatively few and simple concepts from quantum mechanics are needed
   to make quantum computers a possibility. The subtlety has been in
   learning to manipulate these concepts. Is such a computer an
   inevitability or will it be too difficult to build?    In this paper we give a tutorial on how quantum mechanics can be used
   to improve computation. Our challenge: solving an exponentially
   difficult problem for a conventional computer---that of factoring a
   large number. As a prelude, we review the standard tools of
   computation, universal gates and machines. These ideas are then
   applied first to classical, dissipationless computers and then to
   quantum computers. A schematic model of a quantum computer is
   described as well as some of the subtleties in its programming. The
   Shor algorithm [1,2] for efficiently factoring numbers on a quantum
   computer is presented in two parts: the quantum procedure within the
   algorithm and the classical algorithm that calls the quantum
   procedure. The mathematical structure in factoring which makes the
   Shor algorithm possible is discussed. We conclude with an outlook to
   the feasibility and prospects for quantum computation in the coming
   years.
   Let us start by describing the problem at hand: factoring a number N
   into its prime factors (e.g., the number 51688 may be decomposed as ).
   A convenient way to quantify how quickly a particular algorithm may
   solve a problem is to ask how the number of steps to complete the
   algorithm scales with the size of the ``input'' the algorithm is fed.
   For the factoring problem, this input is just the number N we wish to
   factor; hence the length of the input is . (The base of the logarithm
   is determined by our numbering system. Thus a base of 2 gives the
   length in binary; a base of 10 in decimal.) `Reasonable' algorithms
   are ones which scale as some small-degree polynomial in the input size
   (with a degree of perhaps 2 or 3).
   On conventional computers the best known factoring algorithm runs in
   steps [3]. This algorithm, therefore, scales exponentially with the
   input size . For instance, in 1994 a 129 digit number (known as RSA129
   [3']) was successfully factored using this algorithm on approximately
   1600 workstations scattered around the world; the entire factorization
   took eight months [4]. Using this to estimate the prefactor of the
   above exponential scaling, we find that it would take roughly 800,000
   years to factor a 250 digit number with the same computer power;
   similarly, a 1000 digit number would require years (significantly lon
   ger than the age of the universe). The difficulty of factoring large
   numbers is crucial for public-key cryptosystems, such as ones used by
   banks. There, such codes rely on the difficulty of factoring numbers
   with around 250 digits.
   Recently, an algorithm was developed for factoring numbers on a
   quantum computer which runs in steps where is small [1]. This is
   roughly quadratic in the input size, so factoring a 1000 digit number
   with such an algorithm would require only a few million steps. The
   implication is that public key cryptosystems based on factoring may be
   breakable.
   To give you an idea of how this exponential improvement might be
   possible, we review an elementary quantum mechanical experiment that
   demonstrates where such power may lie hidden [5]. The two-slit
   experiment is prototypic for observing quantum mechanical behavior: A
   source emits photons, electrons or other particles that arrive at a
   pair of slits. These particles undergo unitary evolution and finally
   measurement. We see an interference pattern, with both slits open,
   which wholely vanishes if either slit is covered. In some sense, the
   particles pass through both slits in parallel. If such unitary
   evolution were to represent a calculation (or an operation within a
   calculation) then the quantum system would be performing computations
   in parallel. Quantum parallelism comes for free. The output of this
   system would be given by the constructive interference among the
   parallel computations.

Because the thermodynamics assume a *closed* model. The base assumption of
your model is that it is closed. This means that not only the mirror, and
the two focii are in the system, but also the light source. When taken as a
whole the entropy is constant. Now if you allow the light to pass through
the mirror from outside an initial axiomatic assumption, a closed system, is broken.
This is the reason that thermodynamic arguments against evolution fail, the
Earth is most certainly *not* a closed system.

Um, actualy no. Since the photons are coupled we know that the second photon
has actualy changed it's polarization, either that or your original
assumption they are coupled is not true. The polarization between the two
photons *must* be zero. Otherwise you arent' playing with our physics.
Correlation is not a function of any quantity conservation operation.
The values of the photons are actualy opposite and therefore sum to zero.
Foo is not the inverse of Bar, as is the case for horizontal and vertical
True, but the swap of polarization was *not*. That occured later and is what
changes instantly irrespective of distance.
Yes, it causes the correlation to be destroyed. You are not taking into
account the correllation or polarization dependency between the two photons.
Our base assumption is that when photon A is horizontal then photon B is
vertical. This *must* occur to preserve symmetry.

A couple of other points that I should have added. Your base assumption that
light and heat are not the same thing is faulty. They are in fact identical
so to speak of the 'law of optics' and the 'laws of thermodynamics' as
different things is in error.
What happens in the *real* world is that a point is reached where the amount
of energy emitted by each foci exactly balances the amount of energy
received by each foci. We in effect reach thermodynamic equilibrium, better
known as heat death. This term means that the minimal level of disorder has
been reached by the system under study and without outside intervention no
change, outside quantum fluctuations, will take place.

That begs the question and misrepresents reality to a good degree. People
take the choices they think they have, usually those choices are made
available by the party that is operating the service the consumer will
use. So, there is usually very little say for the consumer other than
yes/no. This is not the fault of the consumer, it's the fault of the
producer. In their drive to gain a significant share of the market
(something which goes against free market economy by the way) they will
reduce the number of combinations they must offer (reduces cost).
Blaming the consumer is simply a quick way to justify whatever strategy
the producer finds attractive.
History says otherwise...
Why does IRC need encryption? Why authentication? I can see no reason to
authenticate IRC sessions. This is contrary to the spirit of free speech
and open access. Encryption won't prevent snooping since joining the
servers themselves is trivial for the potential user and provides yet
another sole source for traffic analysis. Being easy to join is what IRC
is about after all, it's hard to build a community otherwise.
What IRC needs is anonymity, distribution, and a mechanism to limit the
sorts of activities (ie anti-Dos) that cause the problems. This should be
resolved in a "Open Source" sort of mechanism and not through some
proprietary (irrespective of how voluntary, after all what sort of choice
is there if there are no alternatives?) society.
Personaly, p-2-p technology is the way to go with IRC. Not more
centralized servers. That way if some script kiddy gets randy the one or
two clients they connect to directly can eliminate the problems. After
all, you have a right to do what you want until it interferes with
somebody else.
It's 'lovely' because you're already biased to that view.
Do current operators have the choice to not join, to take their IRC toys
and go elsewhere? Then it isn't unfair, it's inconvenient perhaps and
it's definitely autocratic. Neither of those make it unfair a priori. For
it to be unfair the action would have to prevent you from choosing
alternative selections.
What amazes me is that instead of whinning about it they don't go out and
create more IRC channels. It's parallel to the question of why on a list
of hundreds of 'crypto-anarchic individualist' we only see a handful of
mailing lists (though they are trivial to build and inexpensive to operate). It's also similar to Eric's comments above about 'sheeple', why
is it that anarchist/libertarians are always saying on one hand that the
way to run a society is to let individuals make choices, yet they're the
first to complain about how 'stupid' people are when they don't take the
choices the anarchist/libertarian wants.
This is GOOD, diversity through philosophical disagreement means the
system is working.
Here's a monopolistic market and forces are driving a split and even the
anarchist are against it apparently.
Whine, whine, whine. This is one of the most self-important, self-serving
commentaries I've seen in a long time. This guy is a bozo.
His argument is something like this:
-	The organization is changing the way it operates through a
-	The current operator wants to keep it the same and feels that
"I lost, and that isn't fair."
There is a distinction between 'EFNet Admin' and 'IRC Admin'. As to
'conform' or be 'de-linked', that's the way 'free choice' works. You go
along or you go alone (at least until you can find some more suitably
minded parties).
As to the point of a list of servers which won't be served, there is
nothing wrong with that under this mechanism. If I have a party at my
house it's up to me whom to invite, simply because I might know you
doesn't give you any right to show up without an invite.
What this whole bunch of bozo's needs is a p2p deamon that has something
akin to 'host.deny/host.allow' that applies to domain names, IP's,
channel ID's, and user ID's. If you want to create a 'permanent'
channel why should EFNet be the ones to decide? Why not let the 'market'
decide through their transient choices?
This is just another example of why human psychology makes anarchic or
libertarian communities unworkable. People have entirely too strong a
social need to be comfortable in such environs. Which side (it's good/it's
bad) isn't important, what is important to recognize the subconcious need
to have a structure at all. Of course this also ignores the tendency of
most people to be 'lazy' with respect to their contribution to a project.
Which is really one of the main reasons we don't see more CDR nodes or
alternate IRC networks springing up, it takes responsibility and activity.
This is probably a good thing really. It makes it harder for LEA's and
other 'mallet's' to have a window of opportunity that is open long enough
to take advantage off.
They already are, and have been for years. Usenet is another service that
could use some sort of p2p datahaven environment. This should be one of
the Cypherpunk 'target projects'.
Of course this activity is yet another example of how
'anarchit/libertarian' market ideals are not the ideals that the community
as a whole desires. It's also demonstrates that 'free markets' without
some 3rd party regulation (eg 1st and 4th) are inherently unstable.

You (and apparently Eric) haven't ever heard of cron and tar? The job
you're speaking of is called a 'system administrator'. There job is to
archive the contents of the companies machines. Make multiple copies and
then escrow at least one of those copies in another physical location.
The reality is that if a company gets hit with this sort of problems (ie
document loss) then they have a competancy issue of a bigger proportion.

Actualy any time that can't be described using a polynomial (i.e. a0 +
a1x + a2x^2 + ...) is NP. For example something that executes in factorial
or exponential time is NP.
If it is found that all NP can be reduced to P then I'd expect to see
somebody be able to express a factorial (for example) as a polynomial.
I ain't holding my breath.
The 'nondeterministic' part simply means it's unknown if the problem can
be reduced to a polynomial representation.
As to 'guessing', some processes are polynomial and some aren't.

Actualy it's all of them. Where the question comes from is when one looks
at what it different instances of a given problem (e.g. the number of
closed loop paths with no double crossings of a set of bridges, or the
number of sequences that a set of cities can be visited without repeats).
The goal is to find a solution in a fewer number of steps. There seem to
be two major categories P and NP.
So for the travelling salesman problem the question becomes how to
describe the way the resources and problem space grow with relation to the
number of cities. Were that relation to be describable in a polynomial
then it would be a P. It looks like the problem is not describable by a
polynomial and is therefore NP.
Stripping context removes meaning for anything. It's also changing the
rules in the middle of the game.
Well, if we're going to speak strictly then you're wrong. Strictly
speaking we're talking of the relative complexity to resolve certain
classes of problems. And in that case it DOES make sense to word
statements like this.
One can say that a given problem is "x^2" (which can't be NP since x^2 is
a monomial, a class of polynomial and therefore P) with relation to
resources or number of potential solutions with respect to going from n to
So, if I have 10 of something and manipulate them and it takes me x amount
of time and y resources. And I know the problem is "x^2" then I know that
even small changes will drasticaly increase the number of solutions that I
have to resolve. In fact I know that if I go to 20 of them things then
I'll have to deal with a run time of approx. x^2 and require about y^2
The point is to find an algorithm that uses those resources more
It depends on it's complexity. And it does make sense of speaking to a
particular algorithm (e.g. Seive of Aritoshanese) as being NP (which it
No, because 'primality testing' has a host of algorithms. It appears they
are NP, but if somebody were to find a NEW algorithm that did it in P then
primality testing, at least with respect to that algorithm, would be a P
class problem.
Another aspect of the N=NP is that the assumption is that if we can
resolve a single NP to a P then that should resolve ALL NP to P. That's a
pretty big leap with no real analysis behind it. A canon of faith rather
than proof or fact.
So the question does in fact effect isues of problem class, algorithm
selection, and execution resource requirement.

See the last sentence in para 1 above.
You are in fact saying if I can resolve one NP -> P then I can resovle ALL
NP as P. Yet in your earlier email you said the opposite, that you didn't
believe that saying the solution of one NP in a P format meant that all NP
could be solved in a P format.
You are in effect saying that primality, travelling salesman, etc. are
reducible to a single algorithm with respect to resolution.
To word the assertion differently,
"All problems can be reduced to a sum of products such that no single
monomial has a factor more complicated than a power."
I really doubt reality is that simple.
As to Cooks assertion, it is possible to create logical statements which
are irresolvable, irrespective of time or algorithm. So it is clear that
there are in fact statements which can't be resolved so there must be at
least some class of NP that are not resolvable to P.
But you're welcome to your own opinion.

Hi Bill,
Which is mathematicaly equivalent to having an algorithm that solves the
problem directly in polynomial time. One only has to add to the solution
time the factor that represents the 'walk time'. Let's consider a prime
seive. The numbers are the positive integers and they're a line. So we
take the time to check the solution for any given guess and add to it an
'mx+b' factor to represent the time to generate your guesses (in this
cases the positive integers).
Last time I checked a polynomial plus a polynomial was just another
polynomial. We're not talking about absolute magnitudes but rather the
relative magnitude differences of the algorithms.
How one pronounces 'tomato' isn't relevant.
In fact, it is clear that if the algorithm necessary to generate your
'guess' is itself non-polynomial then you've demonstrated the sum (i.e.
time to generate guess plus time to check) can't itself be polynomial. In
the case where a random number is used to generate a guess then the factor
is a simple constant (i.e. '+c') added to the solution time. Iterations by
constant value will also consist of the 'loop time' to execute the sum,
again a simple constant. So, in most cases the effort needed to generate
the guess or walk sequentaly through a state space or through a random
proceess is inconsequencial.

Infinite? It isn't even countable. It's of class Aleph 1, not Aleph Null.
The problem is the last conditional of your definition. It's impossible
even in principle to create such a universal set and define an operator to
say if a particular sentence does or doesn't resolve, never mind it's
actual value. Godel disallows a universal sentence consistency verifier,
as distinct from a universal resolver which it also prohibits. Your
conditional assumes axiomaticaly the existance of such a beast. In
effect Godel says you can't have a universal translator (i.e. Translate
the Boolean sentence into a 0 or 1 depending upon if it is consistent or
'has a satisfying assignment').
You are, with that conditional, in effect saying that even though Godel's
Incompleteness Theorem says that I can create Boolean sentences that are
not resolvable you can resolve all of them. Clearly paradoxical. I feel
safer giving up 'has a satisfying assignment' over Godel's.
The reality is that if you have a problem set such that all members are
resolvable you are using a sub-set of the actual problem set. In other
words you've found a 'distinction'. It is my assertion that there are many
such 'distinctions' in the NP set that in fact mean there are different
classes of NP problems which are not resolvable to one another and whose
solution algorithms are completely indipendent. The first such
distinction, per Godel's, is that there are some problems I can't resolve.
So, why should there be only a single distinction? I can certainly think
of no reason to limit it. So, unless somebody can demonstrate that NP
problems break down only into solvable and unsolvable problems (which
isn't possible via Godel's) I feel pretty safe that P<>NP (I'm pretty sure nobody can build a universal tester for that either). While P may be in NP, there are some NP that won't resolve to P's.
I've unexpectedly run into this exact same sort of problem with Goldbach's
recently. Additive Number Theory of class h=2 and degree 1 are fun!
When one speaks of 'cosmological' sets (i.e. sets that contain all
possible arrangements) it isn't possible even in theory to actualy resolve
all of the individual members.

Here in Texas it has to be a domicile or a place of business to be
required to have toilets. And if the building doesn't have them then it's
usualy grandfathered (at least until the next time you need a building
permit to do a mod).
Nada, call your electric company. Ask them what happens if you turn off
the electricity where you live? Nothing.
Of course you can avoid this by living outside a city. Generaly the county

come from bad experiences like Mrs. Oleary's cow (though it really wasn't

No, it's because the continent of the US is larger and as a consequence
the weather tends to be more violent. Got something to do with the size of
the air masses and their ability to store energy. Review some good weather
texts. [1]
We have hurricanes, tornadoes, flash floods, locust swarms (here in Texas
every year they get so thick you can literaly sweep them with a broom),
etc. at a much higher rate than Europe.
And anyone who hasn't seen a Force 5 tornado literaly rip the slabs of
houses out of the ground and sling them for over a mile, or a playing card
stuck edge on in a telephone pole, or ever seen a 20 ft storm surge come
in (I grew up around Galveston & Freeport and used to surf the hurricane
surges) will never understand keeping an eye on the weather.
When was the last time a town literaly ceased to exist, except for an
empty cow pasture, in less than 30 minutes due to a tornado in Europe? No
houses, no fences, no trees. If you'd like to see an example review
Gerrold, TX and the F5 that hit there a coule of years ago. And we get mud
slides that will match anything in Meditteranean Europe (roughly same
All that flooding that Europe is going ga ga over we get here in the SW
every fucking year. Hell, we had 4in. of rain in about an hour last week
for example. The lake that was very low two weeks ago is now within 2
feet of being full. The lake is held at half depth normaly (for flood
control) and runs about 680ft. It holds over a million acre-feet of
flood storage at that level. You do the math. Our flow rates at some of the damns went from less than 100 cfm to over 20,000 in less than a day.
Crests were 12+ feet over flood for example. And we've got another one
coming this weekend. When I was about 7 or so (1967?) it rained for 28
days straight in Galveston. I have this vivid memory of us driving through
flooded Houston in my dad's truck getting a giggle out of the thousands of
stranded cars sitting in water that went halfway to the windows just so
we could get my Aunt who worked on the other side of town and couldn't
get out. There's a reason the houses down there are built on stilts and
3-4 ft pier-and-beam slabs.
But it's not just Europeans, even yankee's (northerners) get a lot of guff
about the weather. In Chicago we see reports of people dying when the
temp. hits the high 90's for a few days. It stays hi 90's here in Austin
for months. We had 2 weeks of over 100 temperature and the nightly temps
don't get below 90. Yet we have very few if any deaths. And I've yet to
meet anyone who doesn't stand in awe at the Texas thunder bumpers.
Lightning and thunder like no place on Earth, except Florida.
The flip side is that we, in the SW at least, don't know shit about cold
weather and feet of snow. A cold winter for us is several 3-4 day stints
of sub-freezing, above zero, temperature (though you don't usualy hear of
anyone dying there either). When it snows here in Austin (and it doesn't
melt instantly) the entire town literaly closes up and eveyrone goes out
and plays in it. Drives folks from the cold climes absolutely batty.
There's an old saw about Texas,

Godel clearly applies to Boolean algebra. The theorems we are speaking of

This following a near impeachment.
What happens if by the day the new president is to take his oath there is
still no clear winner? Even if the candidates get together and one is a
gracious loser, the trauma won't be lessened. There will be literaly no
faith in the president. What would Congress need to do in order to pass an
emergency resolution that would allow the current president to stay in
office until the issue is resolved. Could this be a new way to get a third
term? Would the vice-president (who serves when the president can't) then
be the next in line (assume the speaker of the house would be next if
memory serves)?
Any civil liberties group worth the name better get ready to go into high
gear. Voters and juries are going to be extremely critical of government
Expect to see a drop in law and government related employment below it's
current nadir.
This will probably distract the military from as many foreign involvements
as well. There will be no clear foreign policy. This could have
devastating effects for many of the high tension areas (e.g. China -
Taiwan). It will probably effect global terrorism as well. We'll also see
an increase in espionage as well. This could effect future crypto regs in
a negative way as well. Cyphers and paranoid politicians.

What if this further alienates the younger set and what we're looking at
is possibly the first time in history where one society will be replaced
in the space of 20-40 years, non-violently and completely, by something
only remotely related?
It will be a society which embraces technology and individualism in a
new uniquely American experiment?

Go read the 12th. It all assumes the basic vote is valid. This is the same
mistake Declan made in his (typically) self-inflating way.
And then ask yourself, ok. Let's assume that the vote does go to the EC as
it stands. The people in general won't have any faith in the results. Now
Congress recognizes this and decides to step in per the 12th. Will this
resolve the issue? No. Most people are still going to see a bad election
followed by the people who managed the bad election (in principle if not
practice) making the choice. Another indication of 'vote value' or lack of
However it goes, this one is going to wake some folks up.
It will be more than Floridians.
See Kennedy/Nixon.
I agree with your last statement, you are confused.

There is no standard size. Usualy county lines are drawn for historical
reasons. Though at time of statehood this does get reviewed and modified.
Texas has over 200. Some have several M (I live in Travis and it has 1M,
Harris Country [Houston] probably has close to 5M) a couple in W. Tx. have
only a few thousand.
I'd be surprised if many (any?) states have any sort of program to get
people to perferentialy live in certain counties. I suspect the other
counties might get upset.
I suspect Florida is quite similar.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Katz /. piece on improving "political technology" 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Unfortunately Katz'a and your crypto-anarchy-economic understanding and predictions are based in 18'th/19'th/20'th century
concepts and views. They unfortunately bear little resemblence to the
motivation of those actualy living the event.
Actualy it won't. When the society gets to this level it no longer needs
such structures. The individual controls enough resources directly that
such assaults, while devastating to the target, will render the attacker
in an equaly sorry state. The quantity and types of controlled resources
are also sufficient to elleviate the 'homeland' motivation. Nation states
won't exist in that sort of environment either, for the same sorts of
reasons. There will be giant manufacturing firms for hardware.
This won't of course come to pass until mankind is well off this mudball.
There simply aren't enough resources on a sigle planet to support even a
small group of such technologist for more than a few years. Certainly not
the 100's of Billions such a society will require.
Consider Kurzweill's predictions of the last few days for example. With
such a technology many of the current business and social institutions
become questionable at best. In a very real sense the concept of
'business' and 'profit' become problematic but let's not upset anyone too
badly to start.
The singular aspect of the crypto-anarcy view that is most laughable is
that almost everyone runs around thinking the world will be the same,
there just won't be taxes or cops/soldiers. How naive. 99% of the current
social meme's in your head are obsolete today, almost all of them will be
worthless 50 to 100 years from now when this sort of potential really
begins to arrive. With the taxes and cops demise will go the vast majority
of day to day trappings you're familiar with. Look around, are you willing
to give this ALL(!!!) up? It isn't pick and choose.
Autarch is NOT anarchy and they're not 1-to-1 mappable in axioms.
If you want this utopian vision (it will have it's own crosses to bear, be
warned) as soon as possible then put every iota of energy into getting
mankind off this mudball permanently.
Consider the impact of current neurological research into human cognition,
fundamental limits to capacity are being found. Without biotechnologies
ability to address this many of tomorrows problems won't get resolved and
this utopia won't happen (can you say "bye bye dino"?). The current
religious, social (incl. religious), and economic institutions can't
survive in a world of such morphed humans who live 200 years. I can
suggest "Man after Man" by K. Drexler.
The reality is that while most of us will reap the benefits of life
extension we'll be locked out of the majority of future human development
because we were born too early to genengineered in the womb. Respected and
pitied at the same time.
Unless of course the human mind isn't an artifact of the ghost in the
machine and really is just a machine. In that case transfer into a 'new'
body would be possible. My guess is this is about 200 years off. The odds
are that about 50% of those people reading this who don't die in the next
20 years will live to see it.
Where's your fucking stock market in that sort of world? It isn't. The
technology is so pervasive and 'open source' while the pockets of humanity
are so wide spread that such entities can't exist.

If 'you' knew that, nobody could tell from the comments. The general
cypherpunks view seems to be the PGP web-of-trust is sufficient (and they
are woefully wrong).
This is actualy one of the two key problems with PKC management,
authentication/verification. The other being scaling. The
authentication/verification problem itself has two branches. The first
being submitter/user authentication and the other being
protocol/implimentation verification.
As to scaling, I've been touting 'small network' approaches for years. It's interesting that Napster and it's ilk are just that. Couple this with a
universal namespace (ala Plan 9) and some service like LDAP and you might
have a usable system. Couple this with a cryptographicaly secure network
layer (this is another key management problem also) and 'indepenent' or
open source nameservers (for IP resolution, not to be confused with the
'working' namespace I mention above). The only thing I've seen that looks remotely workable is completely
distributed and open sourced. The problem is setting up the not-for-profit
namespace and key registries (assuming the problems above are resolved).
How should they be funded?
There is no real answer to any of them at the current time though.

There is an interesting article in the New Scientist about attempts to
prove the Reimann Hypothesis.  Alain Connes is one of the people
mentioned; he's working on a method based on quantum chaos.  The article
doesn't mention cryptography, oddly, among the fields that might be
effected if the hypothesis is proven.

No, it is a secure proxy protocol through bits that doesn't require

@_subject: CDR: Re: Public Key Infrastructure: An Artifact... 
The reality is that, other than for emotional reasons, there is no real
requirement that the purchaser and the provider have any relationship
other than anonymous.
The real problem is in guaranteeing to all parties that the binding
between the key and the 'owner' be absolutely air tight. Unfortunately
this is the one aspect that has received the least attention. It is the
primary problem with key management other than scaling. If the relation
between owner and key is not strictly secure then problems arise.
Face to face (so much for anonymity to a third party) and trusted
intermediaries (which opens up traffic analysis and rubber hose attacks)
are clearly not sufficient. This is the reason I say the PGP style
web-of-trust is not effective.
How do you anonymously guarantee the binding between the two parties and
their respective keys, while remaining anonymous? Is it a requirement that
one or more parties have access to the (public) keys?

Bullshit on all points.
If you don't believe businesses don't use guns then you should check
around. Hell, my local grocery has an armed guard at the front entrance
when it's open (and other times I suspect). Tell this to your local
mid-level drug dealer.
Most people encounter a gun at least daily within say 50 ft. of their
person, thought they may not be aware of it or individualy handle it.
Most people, industrial country or not, are controlled by the beliefs they
hold and what they believe is acceptable. Corporations and governments are
as much a victim of this as the individual is.

Which was never it's intent outside of interstate and international
commerce. There is a reason that there is no mention of commercial
representation in the Constitution, in a government of the people, for the
people, and by the people there are no businesses. They aren't people.
Business exists to empower people to develop governments which allow them
to attain their goals and dreams. Neither government or business is an
ends in and of itself.
With respect to Gibson, you should re-read his work then. There is
government (e.g. Turing Police). Also, who originaly built the hovercraft
or robots at Dog Solitude?
The point of Gibson's work is that corporations and government are the
primary corruptors of society.
"the government' is a group of people...to rephrase,
"The group of people we delegate decision making, problem resolution, and
enforcement thereof to does far more to control us (and just generally
piss in our rice crispies) than corporations."
And this surprises whom?
Then again, what are corporations? A group of people who delegate decision
making, problem resolution, and enforcement thereof with respect to profit
It means little, when we get right down to it, so say that one group of
people have a larger influence over us than another. The real point is why
we delegate that authority in that manner.
Of the people, by the people, and for the people after all assumes that
there is A people. A coherent population that respects the ideals of the
American democratic experiment. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people
(including those who enact those ideals) are ignorant [1] of those ideals.

Oh, and to actually return to Sunders original point of copyright. Editing
the copyrighted file actually shows intent. At least my excuse is the god
damned software is intentionaly designed to force the behaviour.
But I did find a way to remove the attachments with only 1 extra click.
Though Netscape screams like a banshee when you do it (You pick up
another extra click here as well which makes the exercise entirely too
tedious - and I'm sure as hell not opening another(!) window - you've
got your modem picadillo and I've got my software elegance standard -
Want respect? Give it.). Clearly Netscape feels that the argument over
unintentional (or 'forced' depending upon POV) copyright violations are
less important than keeping attachments on 'send page' commands. It's
always seemed to me that it would have made more sense to fetch the page
reference when the mail was opened. But I didn't write the friggin beasty.
If you don't like the behaviour then send a note to Netscape. I'm not
going to do anything except keep transiently using the program and to keep
participating in the list. If that means the occassional unintended
attachment then so be it.
Deal with it. If it really bothers you but you don't want to unsub then
you can kill file (Mommy, can I go out and kill tonite?) or you can start
your own node. File size limitations would be completely acceptable so
long as you don't truncate the messages on the backbone that you forward
to other core nodes. File size truncation would need to be limited to
your direct subscribers only.
You are of course always welcome to keep whinning. Empower the individual!

Most of the stuff in "Dettering Democracy" is newspaper articles, books,
and government reports. Much of it was sitting in the stacks at the UT
Austin library (UT Austin supports LANL which is a major Latin America
resource and "Deterring Democracy" is about central America in large
part). Wasn't very hard to check at all.
I've only read a couple of Chomsky's books (the other being parrt of "The

took them out of context. Surely you can point to a single book, a single
chapter, and a single cite that you KNOW is provably incorrect or clearly
out of context. The difficulty of verifying the rest of the cites is moot
at that point after all.
Where is the bogus cite?

The current hurricane in Belize. Had the government not stepped in and
'price fixed' the stores would have been depleted and cached by the few a

Why in major disasters do prices go up, when it is clear this is contrary
to the best interest of the market? That without price fixing the majority
of people will be left without. Why is this hands-off philosophy not held
accountable for its failings? I must assume that the resultant famine due
to price inflation by the individual resource owners is still a result of
that government interference. ;)

So, how come all of a sudden we're injecting algorithms that the users
must know to even access the network? What sort of regulatory mechanism is
required to mediate changes to the process?
So, we can't send uuencoded text to guard against ASCII-pure (i.e. 7-bit)
machines? Why not? I actualy prefer that sort of stuff because as a last
resort I can check it visualy for errors.
Why not offer a set of services and 'default' or 'best practice'
suggestions, leaving the actual decisions up to the user where it belongs?
A remailer should do NO content checking, ever. It's ONLY job is to route
and destroy traffic analysis.

What algorithm is proposed that can reliably determine the difference
between plaintext and cyphertext, note that we don't know what algorithm
is used, with only 20 bytes/char's?
Another question I have is, does this mean that anonymous stego isn't

What algorithm will reliably find stego data?

Actualy, with respect to free market theory, yes.

A rather long quote from Hayek,
Patents, in particular, are specially interesting from our point of view
because they provide so clear an illustration  of how it is necessary in
all such instances not to apply the ready formula but to go back to the
rationale of the market system and to decide for each class what the
precise rights are to be which the government ought to protect. This is a
task at least as much for economist as for lawyers. Perhaps it is not a
waste of your time if I illustrate what I have in mind by quoting a rather
well known decision in which an American judge argued that "as to the
suggestion that competitors were excluded from the use of the patent we
answer that such exclusion may be said to have been the very essence of
the right conferred by the patent" and adds "as it is the privilige of any
owner of property to use it or not to use it without any question of
motive." It is this last statement which seems to be to be significant for
the way in which a mechanical extension of the property concept by lawyers
has done so much to create undesirable and harmful privilige.

They do it now, sans encryption. The mass distribution is what makes it
economical. If the encryption can be gateway'ed then it's useless and
doesn't raise the cost significantly.
A more useful mechanism would be to distribute the keys and appropriate
client software to spammers. What's a flat $50?...
And it has NOTHING to do with the encryption. The lack of log's is what
prevents back tracing.
No, the goal is to stop spammers.
In addition, there are aspects of remailer operation that make the
complaints about spam pretty irrelevant.
Nobody said anything about the interim processing until now. How is this
relevant to the 'free speech' aspect of requiring the use of particular
forms of encryption end-to-end.
Where's the key management mechanism to ensure the security of the traffic
in the reamiler network?
It's your problem, there are aspects of this proposal that are simply
silly, and several others that haven't been adequately explained or
You talk about decreasing the load due to spam, and don't even recognize
that you've replaced it with a whole other process. One that potentialy
could be more complicated, error prone, and expensive in time and resource
impact than the original 'problem'.
The solution to bad speech is more speech, not regulation. And don't kid
yourself that setting up such a mechanism isn't regulatory.
What algorithm are you proposing to identify plain-text? There are key
managment issues, what is your proposal for this problem? There is the
increased complication of admining the box (think of resources to support
both the remailer operation as well as the encryption - consider that
scale carefuly).
I'm in Zimbabwe and the remailer is in the US, how do I manage the keys to
enter the network in such a way that it is secure?
You need the key to get into the remailer, otherwise how does it tell the
message is encrypted? You seriosly propose sticking some static PGP header
for example will stop anyone, spammers know how to use word processors too
you know.
Yep. Apparently better than you do.
Have a nice day you pretentious butthead.

No stupid, there are lot's of persons called the 'market'. There is no
'market' without those individuals. When the market goes out of
equilibrium then free market mechanisms are not enough to correct.
It is not in the interest of the market to have a percentage of the market
die due to resource limitations. If you don't get this then I'm not the
dumb one here.
Oh, on your comment about database usage and the 'ownership of 39'. You
mis-represent the situation.
It isn't the number that is of interest and debate, it's the 'Marcel is
...' part. In effect you are taking a number (i.e. your 39) and applying a
context to it based on the activity of one or more individuals. They in
effect 'author context' that gives the '39' a meaning greater than it's
The reality is that anytime any agent accesses data in a database that has
context provided by my activity then they are accessing a work of my
creation. How come I don't get, for example, a dollar each time my context
is accessed? It's effectively theft.

Is there a distinction between 'equilibrium' and 'steady state' in this
I'd say with respect to individual exchanges you are correct. This means
the results of some exchange i doesn't effect exchange t, even if they
involve the same participants. This lack of information transfer, economic
amnesia, is my primary dislike for this theory. However, the
concept of equilibrium does have a time variable. The flow of time is
actualy required for any 'measurement' of that 'equilibrium' (I'll
continue to assume parity per my question above) to be meaningful. There
is of course no requirement that time be linear or smooth.
Many of the folks I deal with have turned to cellular models. They seem to
behave in a reasonable manner and they're reasonably easy to manage. My
personal interest is in the application of modelling the near term
politico-military situation with the two China's.
There is psychohistory at egroups.com, there are several interesting
participants and several of us are working on a CROWDS model. I also have
a history list at SSZ, cliology at ssz.com. For more info,
Right now I'm working on a CROWDS project that models behaviour in
aircraft. It's pretty simple, an ASCII map and some behaviour rules to
animate the passengers written in Perl. Pretty standard cellular automaton
theory. I hope to start on my China simulator some time next year. Right
now I'm collecting data on the American Civil War, WWII (German
perspective), and the current China participants. The goal is to include
'political', 'social', and 'economic' factors into a CA and their effect
on military force growth and use.
Speaking of CA's. I've heard that Wolfrom's new book is supposed to be out
sometime in the next year or so. He claims to have a fundamentaly new
modelling science if I understand the marketing slicks (and they're not
too inaccurate).
I've been saying for several years that an unrecognized threat is the
amount of data available to the larger governments is enough to setup and
run a economic simulator using real world data sets. It's the reason I am
so certain that there must be increased individual involvement and that
control of that data must be mediated by the person generating it - in all
cases. There is no justification for any access to that record being
exempt from monitoring - law enforcement arguments considered.
Which raises the real question of "Ok, where to now?"...

Good. I agree with your comment. The reason that I was asking was
situations like 'A-B Chemical Oscillators' and B-Z generators from
chemistry as well. There is a clear stability but there isn't a
singular steady-state. It seems to me that a statistical mechanical market
modelled as a CA could have similar structures (e.g. Glider Guns). It
would be interesting to understand what that meant in real world
Since it's well understood that CA's represent a general computing
mechanism it's not a leap at all really. Just a different manner of
instantiating them. I think the clear superiority comes from CA's treating
a distinctly modular market modularly where'as DE's tend to consider a
continous domain. people, time, items, services, and specie come in
modular forms. CA's inherently instantiate the concept of 'I' in the
model, allow each cell to have unique 'neighborhood' rulesets.  The hard
part is to figure out how to take that equation and convert it into a
'neighborhood' ruleset. The work of Wolfram and Rucker has been quite
helpful in this aspect. Other nice features of CA's is that they are
naturals for parallel processing. They also fit into OO programming
concepts easily. When you couple this with concepts like 'small networks',
'cake cutting algorithms', evolutionary/genetic algorithms, and fuzzy
algebra/logic, and include game theory in the 'neighborhood' ruleset you
end up with a very flexible tool. This approach is very multi-disciplinary
and differs in characteristics from normal CA's with simple 'survival
neighborhood' rulesets. One difference that drasticlly changes the
behaviour is the allowance of 'action at a distance' with respect to
'neighborhood' selection. Make the state of the current cell a function of
distant cells and not just immediate neighbors. Along this same vein,
instead of the state dependencies being immediate add 'speed of light'
limits via diffusion mechanisms. You can also use things like 'Annealling
Theory' and spin-glasses.
As Rucker says,
There is a better way.
YOU can do it.
Seek the Gnarl!

companies will focus on profits alone and that unfortuantely (and much to

No dipshit, you have a right to TRY TO BE HAPPY.
Typical anarcho/libertarian bullshit misprepresentation. And another prime
example of 'freedom for me, but not for thee'.
This is a perfect example of the failure of libertarian/anarcho thought,
it is completely focused on the 'me'.
When will you learn that free market economics is about the market and its
stability and not the individuals attainment of nirvana. I'll answer my
own question, never.

No, until the SC found the personal income tax legal less than 100 years
ago this was not a valid statement. And it isn't valid today. It is an
expression of the typical anarchist/libertarian bullshit whereby they want
to reap the benefits of a large and dyamic society and its economic market
without having to actualy participate in it.
It is EXACTLY the sort of viewpoints that Hayek warns against with respect
to losses of individual freedom.

A few,
The acceptance by the rank and file of Lincoln's 'fundamental law of
nations'. This has laid the basic groundwork for the ever
increasing 'federalism' (and as a consequence socialism/fascism). The change in life style (e.g. loss of state power) we see a loss of

Because they don't have a section for 'strict constitutionalist'. It isn't

Reply-To: cypherpunks at ssz.com
Seems to me you can do better with a gaming server.  If the gaming
server servers RNGs in a sequence such that each sample in the
sequence can be verified, they don't need to trust the server; or at
least there is an audit function.
Eg. say that the server publishes subsequent pre-images in a
h_0 h_{i+1} = h_i
and the server computes h_i values up to i = 10^8 and then publishes
them starting with h_{10^8}, h_{10^8-1}, ...
Then anyone can verify that the random number is the preimage of the
previous random number.
You do something similar with a more efficient (log(n)) auditing
function with merkle authentication trees.
If they aren't doing this someone should clue them in.

Bullshit. That is such a general statement as to be worthless.
The 'law' stems from the individual right to self-defence. Law is backed
by violence because that is what is is about.
To then try to portray this as the stem of human abuse of same is simply
abusive to the reader. People do not do violence on others simply because
laws exists. It is not unreasonable, to any reasonable person that is, to
expect a certain percentage of persons in 'the law' to abuse it. Where
else is the best place to be after all? As usual, the devil is in the
details. It isn't 'the law' that is the problem, but rather how as people
we allows it to be abused.
Your thesis is self-referential, inconsequential, and still born.

    Seeing that languages, like UDRP, tends to generate a lot of smoke,
I have arranged for a special list called "Lingua at domain-owners.org" for
the purpose of running dialogues on the topic of languages and the
internet, both for those interested from a user standpoint and those who
stand to develop the technologies. (I think it is good if these groups
know each other!!!)
    As in the case of UDRP at domain-owners.org, it will be an open list
with a specific interest and all with sincere interest in the subject
are welcome to join in or simply lurk and glean ideas  Some of you are
like me and just intensely interested and others will be the technical
genius required to make it all come together, but all are welcome.

Then you have no clue how to search 'in document' or you're being

1. If you go to google and use 'mediterranean gibralter waterfall' note
   very first item and note the comment about 'final waterfall'.
2. Get off your lazy butt and actualy execute a search on this document.
   You'll find commentary on,
   "Summary of Lecture - GY 308 (Southampton University)
    Read the course description carefully. Note terminology like
    'gigantic waterfall', comparison to Victoria and Niagra, etc.
You should really learn how to fish.

No, it isn't. I have lived in Texas for 34 of my 40 years and written

(you used to not need this), 5 years of apprenticeship to a current PE,
and pass a test (though my employer can call me an 'engineer' or whatever

can get a 'Professional Engineer' certification but it is not specificaly
in programming. It includes a bunch of crap out of EE & ME as well.
There IS a lot of talk about it but there is NO requirement for licensing

At least here in Texas not at all.
Actualy it has to do more with insurance and legal liability. With the
certification it actualy makes it easier to hold somebody responsible for
failures. There are also a lot of insurance issues (which I don't claim to
fully understand, nor want to) as well. At least here in Texas the move
seems to be pushed mainly by lawyers and other litigation related groups.
It's probably the same group, at least in part, who pushed through the
changes on the Professional Engineer Cert. that required a college degree
to even join the PE program for certification. The same for the Bar a few
years ago they changed it so you had to be a graduage of an accredited law
It's about as silly as the attempted outlawing of self-help legal material
here in Texas by the Bar and its cohorts.
It's a mechanism to raise taxes through the licensing of all business (no
objection) and inrease litigation (big objection).

Since I was mentioned in passing, socialism (at least the way I use it) is
the central management of resources and people without private ownership.
Facism is the central management of resources and people with private
ownership (of course if you don't manage it the way they want they do take
it away - so it does have a 're-definition' of ownership).
When I call anarcho-capitalist, libertarians, and even Tim a socialist, I
mean it in the context of they want to manage the resources to some model
they feel is 'reasonable' and if you disagee too damn bad. The fact it
isn't THEIR private property they want to manage doesn't seem to impinge
into their reptillian psyche not at all. In effect they believe in angels
among men, and as a consequence they must be the angels.
The view in effect reduces my right to decide as an individual and that is
realy what makes it 'socialist'.
The REAL litmus test should be "Does that behaviour interfere with the
expresson of my beliefs?". If the answer is no then it isn't any of the
other parties business and the behavior should have no further regulation
or limitation (unless at a later time it does cross the 3rd party
expression test).
Oh well, another of those COTUS half-baked rants...

I didn't invent the definition. The 'socialist' did.
Not really. The Solidaros movement was a democratic movement where they
wanted to impliment a government that had representation and guaranteed
civil rights (I don't know exactly how far along they've come). But at no
point was their goal the continued management of speech, work, income,
etc. through a central government mechanism.
BAD comparison. The Fortune 500's can't kill me and they can't throw me in
jail for not buying their products or participating in their programs. I
further have the right to tell them to fuck off (equivalent to secession).

Socialism says that if we let the individual manage resources then some
get right and come get poor. They claim that not only should people have
the opportunity to improve, society has a responsibility to make it
happen. And the mechanism is redistribution fo wealth through a
centralised mechanism. That may be a state like a 'federal' system or it
could be a distributed communal sort of thing. The point is that each
individual works for the collective best interest. The consequence is they
do not get representation (at least equal opportunity isn't guaranteed
with respect to politics). So the statism certainly doesn't have to be
'central' with respect to a single party. They are 'central' in that they
are the only parties (wether it's a central federal system or a
distributed communal mechanism). Since all persons work when and where the
state desires things like wage control are inherent and fundamental tools
of economic management. Since there is not equal opportunity with respect
to political potential it is also clear that 'free' speach in the Western
sense doesn't exist.
I'd say you're pretty much wrong on all counts.
And I can sue them or sick the big G on 'em.
The S. Americans are a perfect! example of why unregulated markets, such
as those proposed by some here, don't work. Russia and N. Korea are the
flip side of that extreme.

@_subject: CDR: Re: would it be so much to ask.. 
If you believe capitalism prevents fascism you better do some more
thinking. There is nothing about capitalism that prevents fascism. In
fact, if you think about it the management of private property (by any
party other than the immediate owner) to maximize profit (i.e. the trains
run on time) is a form of fascism. This is especialy true of corporations
(ie fictional people - yuck) and things like LLC's.
By my definition, capitalism is a form of socialism (I personaly think
Marx was an idiot and the communist manifesto has several glareing
incongruities) because it defines the pursuit of capital (the fact that
it is in a small set of hands or lots is to this point irrelevant, what
matters is everyone is at least trying to pursue capital) as the primary
goal of society. It in effect wants to make everyone live by the same
standards and processes.
I would say that my position is the distinction between socialism,
fascims, capitalism, crypto-anarchy are all false distinctions. The
primary point of interest is that each of them is mono-theistic (if
you'll let me bastardize that term) in that they require each participant to pursue the same goals, they require an inordinate amount of
cooperation. They're an attempt to tame the unknown and uncontrollable by injecting an external framework. Hubris at its best.
What a long-term stable human society needs is plurality, distribution, and lots of armed individuals. Yes, it may cause a higher murder rate than
without the guns, but the freedom is much more precious than human life
(if it weren't why spill blood for it?).
Democracy is not about compromise. It is about recognizing fundamental
limits to the actions of both individuals and societies, and respects
those parties right to exist and defend that existance.
Socialism, fascism, crypto-anarcy, bah. A gilded cage is still a cage.
It's always been that way. The Consitition (here comes another of my
half-based COTUS rants) is the first attempt at breaking this. It clearly
says if you take private property for civil use the owner must be
compensated, no exceptions are listed. Unfortunately this has gotten to be
so bastardized (especialy in these days of confiscation) as to allow the
taking of private property without compensation in nearly any
I blame this on the rise of federalism (and as a consequence fascism) that
has taken hold of this country since Lincoln came to power and started the
Civil War.
Lincoln's heart may have been in the right place (I personaly doubt it)
but it doesn't change the fact that his good intentions took us to the
exit to hell. And the real bitch is that Mexican radio that keeps fading
in and out on the AM band...
Capitalism itself has some problems, such as it has no recognition of
civil rights, religion, representation, etc. It's primary function is to
increase the profit margin and raise capital, everything else is
secondary. Nothing angelic in that at all. Greed is an original sin.
Simply because two societies are capitalist, socialist, or democratic
(really anything) doesn't necessarily mean they will be implemented the
same way. What you're doing is confusing principle with practice. We are
after all using these terms in a very! general way. It's not like a
perfect form of any sort of government has ever existed. People aren't
that clean, which is the point under discussion after all and the reason
for governments.
This after all addressed the very heart of my disrespect for all political
systems other than democratic ones. In every case the goal is to manage
all persons using the same standards and practices. Democracy (at least in
principle) is the only political system which recognizes in an axiomatic
way the differences in goals and views of the participants of the system
and (at least attempts to) protects that plurality.
Yes. I am saying that many people out there who call themselves, for
example, social democrats or christian libertarian are confused. They
have not sat down and reasoned their views out from first principles. They
can not explicity list (or even make reference to some extant list) their
fundamental base axioms, identify potential conflicts, and then how those
conflicts are resolved. I believe that most anarchist, libertarians, etc.
are simply people who are intellectualy advanced, emotionaly retarded, and
as a result pissed off that everyone doesn't see things their way, 'cause
it's the right way. In other words they're mad because they can't have
what they want, right now.
The vast majority of poeple think of themselves as good people (even
Hitler thought he was doing good killing Jews). They believe they only
want the best. The only problem is it's the best only from their narrow
perspective. It isn't that they're bad, it's that they've never learned to
think criticaly (or for themselves if you prefer) and as a result they
have failed to develop emotionaly (i.e. empathy).
Intelligence is not all it's cracked up to be.
If the individual does not reserve the right to doubt in all cases then
there can be no emotional development because there can be no conflict as
there is no real choice.
This trend can only be exacerbated by increased federal involvement in our
schools for example. I find this trend horrendous as it is equivalent to
the killing of local culture. Perhaps the very 'mediocrity' that
D'Tokeville (I know the spelling is wrong) was concerned about. I can say
that the Texas of today is not the Texas of my youth. Much of the culture
has been lost with respect to individuals lives and what remains has been
commercialized (e.g. German Texas Bar-B-Q houses) to the point of
homogenization. I personaly want my god damn fiesta's back. I like
whacking the shit out of that pinata! Why there are not groups in this
country attacking any federal involvement in schools leaves me stunned
honestly. It is after all a wholly state level issue.
I will say this, that in regards mediocrity democracy must work at it.
Other forms of government institutionalize it from the beginning. I'll
take democracy, as "We" so poignantly demonstrates the battle isn't about
right or wrong. It's about the right to make the choice yourself.
Democracy at least gives me a chance (i.e. pursuit of happiness). I know
of no other form of government that makes that promise or gives one the
ability to be personaly involved (ie. 2nd Amendment).
Which segues into another point that's been on my mind. Waco. The judge
found the Davidians responsible and the feds without fault.
Strictly speaking, since every citizen has the right to self defence and
that at times in the course of human events, it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them
with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the seperate
and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the seperation.
(oh yeah, so much for Lincolns claim that no country has ever recognized
it's own demise, or the 'supreme law of nations'. Neither exist in this
country and why nobody has ever bothered to mention this also stuns me.)
The Branch Davidians did that. Their 'crime' to defend their 1st Amendment
religion against the federal forces is a sham. They had every right to
kill those agents the moment those agents attempted to enforce their
'jurisdiction' by force. Nature, God, and the Declaration of Independance
(the founding document of the reasons and ethics that justified the
formation of this country) clearly demonstrate this. Only short-sighted
petty officials more interested in their own goals and greed than the
great oath they took can fail to see and understand.
Note I am not saying that in some cases federal agents don't have a
responsibility to settle issues by force. I am saying that the other side
has commited no crime in resisting. This is the true power of the American
form of democracy when practiced honestly. The Founding Fathers (Go
Jefferson!) knew exactly what they were doing.
"I am no mans (or by extention nations) nigger. I refuse to bend my knee
and any man who asks me to can't be an honest American. They can only be
here to oppress me. I will resist."
(It's also why I believe Jefferson was willing to keep his slaves. He
expected a conflict much quicker than actualy occurred. Perhaps as little
as 20 years. I believe his actions were based on rational expediency and
the safety of all concerned.)
THAT is THE fundamental American Democratic Ideal. It is the absolute
bedrock upon which this country is built. The right to resist is absolute.
This is why the 2nd Amendment says 'shall not be infringed'. That means
not registered, not intimidated, not filed, not collated, not infringed.
Unless there is specific evidence pursuant under the 4th Amendment it is
not a federal issue what happens between me and my weapons. The Federal
government may do nothing to interfere with the individual right to buy,
own, and carry weapons. The 10'th Amendment does not invalidate existing
state constitutional restrictions on same howerver. Weapon regulation is a
state by state issue governed by state constitutional regulations
regarding weapons. Note that since a fundamental bedrock of the nation,
and therefore the very states themselves, they are also bound to recognize
this point. In effect American democracy guarantees one the right to cease
participating in the American experiment (or perhaps participate more
actively in it depending on ones point of view).
If America is justified to exist then individual Americans are justifed in
killing any party which attempts to use force against them, as guaranteed
in the 1st and 2nd Amendments. The judge has in effect said that since the
Davidians didn't have a right to protect their beliefs the original
colonist didn't have a right to revolt. As a consequence he has said that
the very system that gives him authority to rule is not itself justified
to exist. And therefore he has no authority to rule.
What a fucking idiot.
It is my biggest condemnation of American jurisprudence that the
Declaration of Independence, the very ethical bedrock of this country -
not English law as the law mongers would have you believe, is virtualy
ignored with respect to the justification of law. Absolutely incredible
and absolutely damning. Treason. We did after all have a war with the
explicit intention of building our own society.
The fact that we have drifted from these ideals should surprise no-one.
The fact is the transient passion of pursuit of liberty will eventualy
fade to the power of longer-term relationships such as language and
family. I suspect this was the ultimate point of Jeffersons comment
on a revolution every so often. Jefferson was unfortunately off a tad.
I'm sorry but I'm getting tired and hungry. I'll leave the remainder of

Yes, it is the right of their parents to protect their children. They have
a right to demand that products and services targeted at their children
conform to the parents desires. The business has no say in it, and
Labeling products as to target audiences and requring parents ok to allow
children to buy adult products is NOT (let me repeat, NOT) cencorship in
any way, manner, or form. It is responsible parenting and the recognition
of business that they have a social duty as well as a economic duty to
provide products with the features their customers want. And if that means
no tobacco adds in kids stores or parental permission to sell certain
types of products to those kids then too damn bad for your profit margin.
If you can't do it then you don't deserve to be in business.
You're real position isn't that the government is telling you how to label
your products, it's that ANY party is saying they want products with
features you don't want to provide.
The failure of capitalism is the failure to recognize that human beings
have rights and that business is simply an expression of individual
rights. Rights allow one to pursue an activity until that behaviour
infringes anothers right to engage in their activity (in this case raising
their children).
Libertarian/crypto-anarchy/capitalism is nothing more than a mechanism to
use the masses for the benefit of the minority. Fucking socialism.

But not one of those documents is IN the Constitution. So you'll have to
fight (not that I agree with this aspect) to get them accepted. After all
there is nothing to keep one from using the 'Communist Manifesto' for a
reference document with respect to unalienable rights.
What the Constitution DOES say is that with respect to inter-state
commerce the federals can regulate it. 'Commerce' has two definitions. The
first is the commenest which is transfer of goods and services. The
second, less well known, is the interactions of individuals. So it is
clear the federals have a direct stipulation to regulate inter-state
commerce and that included person-to-person interactions. So much for
inter-state freedom to associate.
Now what about intra-state? There is nothing in the Constitution that
prevents the application of this basic federal principle to the states
within their boundaries. So, per the 10th the question of whether an
individual had free association within the state would be guided by the
state Constitution.
It should be obvious that there is no fundamental 'right to associate'.
People have a right to be left alone. People have a right to protect
themselves so they have a right to keep you and your burglar budies (for
example) apart so long as there is a reasonable snowballs chance in hell
of you burglarizing anyone. You don't have a 'freedom to associate' that
would let you stroll into a prison and have exchanges with one or more
prisoners unsupervised.
The best one can hope for is that in the pursuit of happiness people must
associate with other people. Within the bounds of the inter-state commerce
clause and the 1st and 4th Amendment the federal goverment can't regulate
your behaviour.
You can associate with anyone provided there isn't reasonable cause to
keep you apart. Under our Constitution the only reasonable cause
acceptable is that the association will cause a crime to be commited (and people squeeze that baby for all it's worth).

Ah, but now you've changed the topic of discussion and hoping nobody will
notice. We're not talking about the behaviour of the kid or the parents
right to drop them off.
We ARE talking about the responsibility of a vendor to provide information
to the consumer (which is after all the parent even if the kid is spending
the money by proxie) per the standard free market model. Simply because
the kid was dropped off does not eliminate the responsiblity of the vendor
to the parent.
Remember, for a free market to work the information must be shared AND
maximized. This means that even if one parent walks in and asks the games
to be rate the vendors responsibility is to maximize that information.
Per Hayek, - a homogenous commodity offered and demanded  by a large number of
  relatively small sellers or buyers, none of whom expects to exercise
  by his action a perceptible influence on price.
- Free entry into the market and absence of other restraints on the
  movement of prices and resources.
- Complete knowledge of the relevant factors on the part of all
  participants in the market.
It's that last one that blows your thesis straight to hell.

If people played 'fair' and actualy stayed within the very limiting

Unfortunately people don't work that way so it won't work that way.
By the time the market can collect the information the abusers are hidding
it's too late for the market to correct. In human socieities there must be
some form of 3rd party arbitration/regulation.
Now the question as to whether this is best served by a central power
structure or a more distibuted one (e.g. polyocracy) is an open question.
I would say historical evidence shows the distributed model is better

There is a deeper point that needs to be made you're glossing right over.
It has to do with that term 'free' or 'freedom' you keep throwing around.
Your application does not do justice to the meaning of the term.
The reality is that 'freedom' means (even in crypto-anarchy circles) the
right (note that word Timmy) to engage in whatever behaviour one chooses
so long as it is consensual and doesn't abridge anothers right to
Trying to 'shun' somebody for their non-invasive behaviour (e.g. two dykes kissing in a ball park) is the peak of anti-freedom. If a person really
respects freedom it is more than 'freedom for me but not for thee'.
The kissing of the girls was nobodies business, in or out of the park in a
FREE society.
Tim, you're a bigot and a hypocrite.

There is NO difference. The fact that it's a business is irrelevant. It's
basic inter-personal respect.
I don't know about a law, if the basic society doesn't understand the
philosophy then the 'law' certainly won't fix that problem. Bottem line, within the context of 'freedom' (for the dykes or business
alike) unless it can be shown that the act will directly
interfere with that place of business then the business has no say in it.
In other words, the personal likes and dislikes of the owner are NOT
expresible through the actions of the business.
Simply running a business does NOT increase ones ability to manage others
actions. Simply wanting to buy an item does not require that I surrender
one iota of my personal liberty.
The act by the business of refusing to service me as a customer because I
don't have the lifestyle they like IS most certainly an infringement of
the civil liberties of the customers and they should be able to take
action accordingly against the business for trying to constrain their
Your freedom means you NEVER have a say in my freedom. Only my (or your)
abuse of that freedom.
Demonstrate that the two dykes infringed the right of the owner to try to
make a profit. Then, and only then, will you have a case to infringe their
right to express their beliefs.
Would it have mattered if it was a guy and his girlfriend? If so, why?
Why is a man and a woman kissing not infringing or damaging but two
women/men is?
It's irrational (which is reason enough to question the business
operations - their supposed to be rational) and it's coercive.
As usual, more 'freedom for me, but not for thee'. Typical
anarcho-capital-crypto-libertarian bullshit.

No, I am applying it quite literaly to the actors in the market. It was
meant to apply to the market and its consituents in toto. You really
should go back and read what Hayek (and Von Mises, etc.) really said about
competition and free markets.
The facts have been seriously mis-represented.
The requirement is meant to relate to ANY factor in the market that
interacts with the participants and the exchange (not the particular
price for that particular exchange).

If it's a business and it's 'public' access then the ONLY reason you would
have a right to exclude anyone would be if they interfered with your
freedom to execute the business.
See the comments I made about the difference between a 'private' and
'public' business.
You have the same fucked up definition of 'freedom' as Tim.
Not surprising.

I didn't get the original message so I'll reply here.
No, we're not talking about lasers. But then again 'coherent' simply means
'arranged' or 'synchronized'. If you don't believe there is coherence in
imaging the rays of light through a camera then you don't have a fucking
clue about optics.
The fact is, that if you take a lens and form an image there IS most
certainly a level of coherence. You can break that coherence by simply
injecting a fogged piece of glass for example.
This is what the walls of the house do, they break the coherence of the
original light rays so that no image can be formed on the other side of
the wall.
Glass howerver is reasonably transparent and as a result the light doesn't
lose coherence through that. However if you attenuate the light using an
aluminized mylar sheet and then break up the image using the bubble pack
(the little bubbles of air absord the IR and then re-emit it out of phase with the original stream of photons - that! is coherence), walah. No
usable image the cops can use against you.

The trick would be to subvert the code management system and the build
shop. That would generaly require higher access than the programmers
have. Not that it couldn't be hacked, but you'd have a lot of logs (and if
they're using a journaling filesystem that adds yet another layer) to
wipe. That means time. Such a hack would take a planned extended effort.
It generaly wouldn't be spur of the moment.
Then again, code reviews on future releases of that code base and the
patch shop roaming around would provide post facto mechanisms for finding
such kludges.

If it's mis-appropriated you should bitch at them. I made a clear note
that I had NOT seen the original and was replying to a copy.
Get your facts straight.
Those are mechanisms that lead to the loss of coherence of the photon
emissions from the original source. You're confusing cause and effect.
Bullshit. If the photons that come off the reflected or secondary source
are distrupted in their phase then no recognizable picture will form.
Yeah, so where in 'coherence' in there? I know what MASER means too.
No, it is NOT in phase with the incoming photon. It IS in phase with the
secondary photons emitted by the material in the lasing body. In general
the optical pump for a laser is a optical flash and it emits no
recognizable coherent photons.
Exactly. And if the photons are not coherent with respect to arrival time
and flight path when you try to take a photo then no picture will occur.
Instead you get a blob.
Note that I am NOT saying the photons are coherent with respect to
their individual waveshapes (ie peaks/vallies match) but rather that their
emission and arrival time are coherent, they happen at the same time and
follow rougly parallel paths (now do you get it, I didnt' think so.).
No thanks, I've got quite a few right here. Beside that I've spent the
last 30 or so years building this sorta shit.
Study nature, not books.
             Louis Agassiz
Yes, it is time-coherent as well as path-coherent (they must be parallel
in order to make a picture). The wall does two things:
It causes the photons emitted at the same time from the source to be
received at different time, this interupts the ability of the receiver to
correlate (i.e. verify coherence) them into a recognizable picture.
The second thing it does is take the intialy parallel rays of light and
break that parellelism, their coherence with respect to path (in other
words their coherence with respect to geometry, lasers require this as
well to laze, it's more than the emitted photons being in step, they
have to be parallel also). The photons that are re-emitted from an
intermediary barrier are NOT parallel (or coherent) with the original
source photons.
[more pseudo-science deleted]
Coherent in physics means 'in phase' or 'in step', it does not mean 'in
phase only with respect to individual wave equations'. There are LOTS of
forms of coherence in physics that have nothing to do with lasers or even
optics. Coherent means correlated with respect to some characteristic.
Instead of reading about a laser, build a couple.

Being against 'free market' bullshit doesn't make one an
'anti-cypherpunk', it does make them a 'discriminating cypherpunk'. It
does however mean they at least recognize that the 'Libertarian' view
of 'god money rules' is bereft of any philosphical import and ethically
about as dead as it's possible to be.
Fuck David Friedman and his 'business has only one purpose: make money'
and anyone who follows his brain-dead dronings.
Actually you have to start out being stupid to fall for libertarian
Freedom for ALL, not just the monied. Libertarians are just another group
wanting to coerce you to their ends - make lots of money for them. And if
you don't have any, well that's just too damn bad. The Libertarian credo
of 'money makes the world go round' is accurate only if you choose to make
it so.
Tell 'em "No thanks".

Actually you may invoke the 5th for anything that isn't in your best
interest (ie witness against himself). The 'incrimination' crap is just
that, a twist on the 'in any criminal case' (the 'any' is the key point).
It's also worth noting there are NO exceptions to this, nowhere in the
Constitution is forced acceptance of immunity for example permitted.
                                 Amendment V
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in
cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual
service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

Yep, let's bitch about how stupid I am and how I don't get it. And at the

Your forte is clearly the ad hominim.
There is no implied consent with respect to removing copyright from the
author of any traffic throug the CDR.
Simply joining this list, or any other, doesn't remove copyright. It
doesn't IMPLY anything outside of resticted permission of the subscribers
to use personaly (not commercialy mind you) as PARTICIPANTS IN THAT
PARTICULAR FORUM.
There is no 'implied stripping of rights' in the copyright law or any of
its applications.
'fair use' will certainly provide some relief for use of this material
outside of the forum it was submitted to. However, that still does not
strip rights or allow you for example to put your name on something as
your work (which is perfectly allowable under public domain) or to use it in a commercial venture of any kind without permission. If you don't get
that permission a priori then you open yourself up to relief for the
copyright holder under the copyright laws.

Of course you do...
It depends on what the alternatives are, if there are none then there
isn't a lot of difference. How gilded the cage is isn't a relevant issue.
'nearly all'? That's a laugh. It happens in all societies because people
are wired that way psychologicaly.
If one defines 'free' as lacking coercion. Of course you can't have any
sort of human interaction without 'coercion' at some level. If it's not
physical, then it's economical, if it's not economical it's religious, if
it's not religious it's racial, if it's not racial it's what sports team,
if it's not a sports team it's emotional coercion via a SO. If it's not
that then it's self-imposed psychological 'benchmarks' we all pick up and
try to measure ourselves against. If it's not one thing, it's another.
People are about manipulating other people.
All the anonymous reputational capital crypto-anarcy crap in the world
won't change that, and it won't protect the weaker from the strong (of
course that concept is completely alien to 'free market' economists and
supporters of David Friedman's ilk).
You should also talk to Declan, you have a future in the 'press'.
Nobody is saying they are the main problem. What they are saying is that
from a 'power broker' perspective, there ain't no difference. And they'd
be right.
Not now, but how long would it take them to move if they thought there
weren't other organizations that would intercede? Not very long.
As usualy you mispresent 'free market economics' as some sort of panacea
that will elliminate 'government abuse' and give us a 'coercion fee'
society. Bullshit. we'd only be trading one tryant for another. Just look
at the history of the 'company store'.

In the first part I will explain what IPsec is and how it is supposed
to work.  I will explain the three protocols which provide security,
and explain the relationships with other technologies such as DNSsec.
I will then explain how to set up FreeS/WAN under Linux.  I will
explain how to patch your kernel and how to make the FreeS/WAN patch
co-exist with the international kernel patch.  Finally I will explain
how to configure and start FreeS/WAN so as to communicate securely
with another machine.
In the final part I will talk about issues with IPsec, such as
interactions with firewalls, and how IPsec could be used to provide
all-pervasive encryption on the Internet.  I am hoping that this part
of the talk will become more of an "open forum" where ideas can be put

I haven't misrepresented anything. You've never defined it. I just assumed
you were speaking english.
Clearly my mistake, I keep forgetting you're like Tim; always re-defining
what a word or term means and then not telling anyone. Then when they use
it in some way that you don't like it's 'their' failure.
Coerce - from L. coercere, 'to restrain', in modern usage it means
something along the lines of 'to compel or dominate by force or threat'.
'force' has no requirement to be physical, any more than 'violence' does.
What you're doing is using a very restricted definition to mean 'physical
force' or 'physical consequence'. Unfortunately this isn't a broad enough
definition to be useful. To claim that psychological coercion is of no
consequence, as your statement implies means that it is you and folks who
use your definition who are missing the bigger picture/problem.
The crypto-anarchy claim that if we'd only get rid of government coercion
all will be good is the real view that doesn't get it.

Silly me, and if I'd included even a single line if text the British
tabloid wouldn't have removed the page about the secret carrying laptop
left in a cab. Or that the 'owner' hadn't advised his superior of the
loss until after security was aware of it.
Actually this is a perfect example of why pet view isn't any more

A post or two yes, you can use under 'fair use', you can't just take posts
willy nilly as you see fit and re-distribute them as you see fit. You
couldn't take a dozen of them in toto and use them without permission
Go back to the Apr. 12 arguments on this point and you'll see the suttle
shift on Declan's position from 'all posts have implied consent' to 'the
press can use them in an article'.
You'll also note that he slipped right by the post I sent in responce to
his 'USENET' claim about 'implied copyright limitations', they don't
You'll also find a post where he admits that were there any 'implied
consent' it would fall to the list operators (of which I am one and he is none) and not newspapers or other 'organizations'.
He's a slippery little beggar who'll lie, cheat, steal, and twist
whatever it takes to keep from going 'Oh, I guess I could have had a V8'.

Hi Brian,
I've been thinking about your project, I like your idea and wish you the
best. I don't think it would be appropriate for the CDR because we have a
specific focus (that does include anonymity) and it doesn't include being
a mule for a stream of anonymous messages of god knows what subject
matter. I will be including information on the SSZ CDR homepage about it,
unless you object.
On the other hand, if you find that your single server can't handle the
load please keep me in mind. I have the resources to support such a
mailing list and especially like the 'distributed' nature you refer to.
Once I get my part of the 'Hangar 18' Plan 9 resource space up and running
I hope to use my 'igor' remailer project for something quite similar. I'm
sure there will be room to collaborate once I get my ducks in a row.

They're also responsible to the same law and license that every other
diamond trader in NY is responsible to. This isn't a 'market' in the
economic sense, it's an extension of their religion (clearly a
non-economic aspect to their culture).
Which again isn't really a 'market' per se since there isn't a statistical
issue here. ALL Jews, as opposed to some percentage of same, technicaly
require their food to be kosher.
They are particular mechanisms for the protection of their culture not an 'economic market' (though both have economic aspects). They don't do it to
protect their income. They do it because they believe it's the 'right'
thing to do, they are answering to a higher calling.

More a statement.
You're confusing pseudonymit and plausible deniability with anonymity.
If the party were truly anonymous there would be no way to identify them
to a third party in order to pass the 'reputation capital' along.
There would have to be a 'persistent nym', not an anonymous one.

And they admit it freely, the 'protection racket of the soul'. This is
after all one of the primary facets of their lives. It's also very
non-economic in character.
It also occured to me a few minutes ago while I was out on an errand that
it's pretty funny that crypto-anarchist are using 'heavily regulated
markets' as examples of the strength of 'free market' and 'reputation
capital' (being devout is related to 'reputation'?).

I was busy over the Easter weekend.
That's new on -anonymous search page! (inserted with htl 60, should hopefully be visible everywhere)
-anonymous key submission (just a description on how to add to the 'freegle' in-freenet key index)
-list of recently added keys
-better navigation
-nicer layout in a shade of orange
And here's the what's-to-come list:
-automated retrieval of the in-freenet key index (should put that in place soon...)
-downloadable version of the search classes, preferably as an fproxy plugin
-source code of all the server-side stuff
-actual crawling (I'm evaluating the WebSphinx crawler toolkit, should be adaptable to Freenet with few modifications)
Enjoy! Laud! Criticize!

I announce the initial release of stegdetect.  Stegdetect is an
automated tool for detecting steganographic content in images.
It is capable of detecting several different steganographic methods to
hide messages in JPEG images.  Currently, the detectable schemes are
jsteg, jphide, and outguess 01.3b.
Stegdetect is covered by a BSD license and should compile and run on
most UNIX-like operating systems.
You can download stegdetect from

Well, part of it, probably. The point being there are many 'kinds' of
'anonymity'. They are not(!) all equivalent.
If there is no 'persistance' the requirement that it be 'untraceable' is
moot, unless you plan on coming back (very bad idea to ever visit the same
place twice, or stay in the same place more than 24 hours).

Isn't the anonymizing agent itself a 'reputation service' in that it's

Of what point is a new born baby? You have to let it grow up.
That depends on the particular context, in addition there is no
requirement that I am aware of that says that all 'modes' of anonymity are
useful. Only that they have a demonstrable difference from other 'modes'.

No, because if the anonymizer fails the clients are screwed.
What if it's not anonymous. What if it's selectively anonymous? What if

Ah, not sure why that did that...
But, more to the point - you shouldn't try to read minds and draw
conclusions from sentence fragments. You are not a good mind reader.
.... a centralized group of servers to distributed not only content but
the indexes. The only real distinction between the two is where the
content resides, not a significant distiction since the system still has
centralized servers.
But more importantly the original claim which you just jumped right over
about the intellectual property being somehow different between USENET and
Napster and that if Napster fell down it would take significantly longer
to recover than USENET is simply bogus.
More 'let's give Jim shit because he keeps poking holes in our favorite

@_subject: The real enemies of the poor 
Exactly, perfect example of my point. You had already made up your mind
that it was a 'worthy' read from past experience.
I don't read it unless I think I'll get something out of it; your
assertion is really a tautology (though you don't seem to see that).
All the time. Irrelevant to the point under discussion though.
Ah, you draw a synonymous comparison that is false. 'expectation' is not
'judgement'. Not synonyms. Expectation is something that happens a priori,
judgement post facto. Further, 'hope' is not 'expectation' either.
As to methodology/scholarship, that's a slippery slope. It could be the
reader not the author...
Another point to add is that by using 'expectation' you're clearly not
approaching the subject without bias (which isn't the same thing, despite
your apparent equivalence, as tabula rasa). For a person to approach a
subject tabula rasa they would need to be ignorant of the subject even in
a subjective sense. If they are aware of the topic the best they can hope
for is non-biased/open minded. Not the same thing.
Generaly when I read a book, assuming it's not for personal pleasure, I'm
not interested in the pro's or con's, but rather what info they can
present that I haven't heard before (back to that hating sequels :). As to
the logical consistency/validity of an argument, I can make my own mind
up. I read books to expand my own model, not to take up anothers.
'wasting time' is 'personality'. Your waste of time is somebodies
jewel of the Nile (I have these images of Creationist books I've read flashing through my mind, very unpleasant).
And there's looking for corroborating evidence... :)
That wasn't where I was going with my commentary. I was simply pointing
out that the way you had worded it made it look like you were choosing
reading/research material based on POV/personality instead of logic of
argument. That you chose reading material based on pleasant past
experience and familiarity rather than raw subject matter relevancy.
As to the general commentary, now it makes more sense with clarification...I even agree for the most part.

@_subject: Spoliation cites 
Bullshit. 'policy' is not 'required by law'.
The only documents the court can reasonably expect any business to retain,
irrespective of (future) reason or possible motive, are those specifically
required by law. These laws in most states are very limited in this
For example here in Texas, a business must keep records according to
purchases and sales for tax purposes, but they are not required to keep
identifying info for the parties making those sales/purchases (there are
some specific laws that extend this, eg chemical sales). But the light
store, for example, dumps the actual receipts after 30 days.
Now if a court comes back and says that such a policy is spoliating
because the oinkdroids happen to want to know if somebody purchased a grow light on a particular date and the policy prevents that, then it's too
damn bad for the court and the cops.
The law does not allow the courts to make up arbitrary 'should have's'
whenever it wants to simply because it's convenient for the court.
(It's also worth mentioning that the reporter who is in jail in Houston
currently faces a maximum 18 months incarceration, after that they get
popped irrespective of what the judge may want, even judges face habeas
corpus on contempt citations eventually)
If courts are not held to account to the same law they execute then the
law is worthless.

Intentionaly turning off logging certainly shows 'intent' which is all

Over what are we arguing? You've raised three seperate issues that are in
conflict in this example. Which one is futile? And if you think 'moral
indignation' doesn't have something to do with war then you truly don't
understand war.
Perhaps, but history is full(!!!) of examples where nations didn't do that

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News

ELEMENT 118 HAS BEEN ERASED FROM THE PERIODIC TABLE.

INSECT SENSES SUGGEST NOVEL NEURAL NETWORKS. Animals gather information about their environments when sensory
neurons fire minute electrical signals in response to chemicals, light,
sounds, and other stimuli. Studying networks of neurons in animals
and insects can provide us with insight to the natural world as well as
inspiration for manmade networks to aid in computing and other
applications.  A new model of neural networks, based on recent
studies of fish and insect olfactory systems, suggests a way that
neurons can be linked together to allow them to identify many more
stimuli than possible with conventional networks. Researchers from
the Institute for Nonlinear Science at the University of California,
San Diego (M. Rabinovich, mrabinovich at ucsd.edu, 858-534-6753)
propose that connections between neurons can cause one neuron to
delay the firing of another neuron. As a result, a given stimulus leads
to a specific time sequence of neural impulses. In essence, the
interconnected neurons include time as another dimension of sensory
systems through an encoding method called Winnerless Competition
(WLC).   Using a locust antenna lobe exposed to fragrances such as
cherry and mint for comparison, the researchers found their model
could identify roughly (N-1)! (equal to (N-1) x (N-2) x ...x 2) items
with a network built of N neurons. That is, a ten neuron WLC
network should be able to identify hundreds of thousands as many
items as a conventional ten-neuron network, and the benefits increase
as networks grow.  The WLC model helps explain how the senses of
animals, insects, and even humans can accurately and robustly
distinguish between so many stimuli. In other words, it is a
mathematical rationale as to why a rose, by any other name, would
smell as sweet---but doesn't smell like an onion. Ultimately, the WLC
model may lead to high capacity, potent computing networks that
resemble an insect antenna or a human nose more than a desktop PC.

DELIVERY OF SINGLE ATOMS ON DEMAND is now possible. Physicists at the University of Bonn hold cold cesium atoms in a
magneto-optic trap, but can shuttle the neutral atoms, one a time,
with great control over distances up to a centimeter by shifting an
additional laser-light interference pattern serving as local potential
well.  This kind of conveyor belt for atoms is expected to be of help
in various quantum entanglement experiments or as part of an atomic
shift register.  (Kuhr et al., Science, 13 July 2001; kuhr at iap.uni-

No, it's not.
Given. So are all the remailers in between.
No they don't. They have at most the sender or the receiver (never both
unless they've already cracked both of them in which case this entire
exercise is moot).
How do you shut a program down that is running independently in a
distributed process space? A process space that is distributed in such a
way that the hardware that executes a particular image of the remailer for
one message is NOT the same hardware that would be used for the next
message. In fact neither the owner of the process or the owner of the
individual boxes necessarily have a say in the selection process. The only way to take that down is take 'em all down at once. Not possible.
Can the US government shut the entire Internet down? No. Can they shut
down just the US based infra-structure in toto? No.
Not hardly. You really, really should read more 9P documentation.
Fortunately encryption software enjoys enough of a 1st amendment shield
that isn't going to happen. A moot point.
Not hardly. Sending an encrypted message to a friend across the country
is not a 'circumvention device' because we aren't doing anything related
to copyrighted material. An anonymous remailer is not a 'circumvention
device' within the context of DMCA.
Hell, if they could manufacture it at will they already would have.
Not hardly. But I'll gladly look at a more fleshed out scenario when you
provide it...
Which Plan 9 and 'small world' networks ain't.

Some specific info on 'implied' copyright.
The best that Declan can hope for is a 'non-exclusive' copyright, but even
that would require an exchange (ie a meeting of minds) between the two
parties. However, that won't fly since, as an operator of at least one of
the nodes, the policy is that you as the original author release no rights
by participating in the CDR itself, implied or otherwise - which I've stated
many times (check the archives). So the 'implied' contract perspective falls
down because one of the parties involved has EXPLICITLY made known the
conditions of use. That over-rides ANY implied anything. Further, by the
other nodes agreeing not to modify backbone traffic they have explicitly
agreed to this for all parties NOT SUBSCRIBED TO THEIR NODE.
What we do have is a EXPRESS LICENSE between node operators. And then a
(potentialy) implied (unless they print a policy on a webpage like SSZ does)
contract between subscriber and node operator.

You don't have to sign it. You only have to agree to it verbally, or in
this case email.
A verbal agreement between two parties that dictate how they will relate
to each other is a contract.
If you don't want to abide by that 'informal' agreement then I'll gladly
remove you from the SSZ CDR feed. It's your call.

But, in this case (as I've claimed in the past) EACH AND EVERY COPY
represent harm to the plaintiff. Of course it makes sense to recover all
copies where each of those copies will cause harm. The purpose of the
court, and law in general, is to reduce 'harm'.
That is NOT the same thing as demanding that an author of a work turn over
each and every copy of same. Of course if there was a defamation issue
then again it would make sense to recover each and every copy.
In the case of something like the Pentagon Papers it makes sense to
ATTEMPT to recover said documents. Since each copy represents harm.
Bottem line, if the court orders all copies siezed there must be some
indication of harm if ANY SINGLE copy remains unrecovered. Otherwise it's
just a violation of the 1st.

MANHASSET, N.Y. - A new report dashes any remaining illusions that 802.11-based (Wi-Fi) wireless local-area networks are in any way secure. The paper, written by three of the world's foremost cryptographers, describes a devastating attack on the RC4 cipher, on which the WLAN wired-equivalent privacy (WEP) encryption scheme is The passive network attack takes advantage of several weaknesses in the key-scheduling algorithm of RC4 and allows almost anyone with a WLAN-enabled laptop and some readily available "promiscuous" network software to retrieve a network's key - thereby gaining full user access - in less than 15 minutes.

It matters from a resolution perspective as well. The fact is you claim
1/20 messages are being dropped (per remailer or per submission? Do you
see any difference in drop rate dependent upon number of remailers, you
should?). That's an ASTOUNDINGLY high figure. Several orders of magnitude
over any expectation of 'normal' behaviour.
This means that not only is the technology itself under question, but its
implimentation as well.
In short, with this level of failure you can't 'trust' anything.
Duplicates are not drops, signatures do nothing for drops. You're changing
the rules in the middle of the game.
Which we don't have if we accept your numbers. Depending on the technology
you're trying to vet is a recipe for disaster (well Mallet won't think

The point is that one remailer isn't sufficient (especially if you've got
some sort of fixed latency, which is pretty much a given even if the
window is 24 hours). Assume a single remailer. Both input and output
stream are sampled. We must assume that the from: and to: are observable.
To deny the from: implies a secondary anonymizing layer, contrary to our
intial assertion. To deny to: implies that there is an additional layer
between the last remailer and the recipient of the traffic. The goal of a
remailer is to break the connection between a given incoming and a given
out-going (ie mix the to:/from: relation) - not to hide either
necessarily. So, even if we generate cover traffic a comparison of all
outgoing with each incoming is clearly realizable using modest resources
(not including the tap itself). As long as your sample window around each
from: event is greater than the latency, you'll find a statistical
correlation to the to: event. It takes at least two remailers and they
must in addition talk with a shared keyset different than either from: or
Now, let's talk about that cover traffic for a moment...
It's random, so subsequent comparisons based around to: or from: events
will cancel out because they won't be repeated often enough. There is the
additional question of just exactly who we're sending that cover traffic
to since we're the only remailer. In addition there is the problem of
exactly how we produce all that bogus traffic. My suggestion is keep a
steady flow of messages (ie  >= C, dmsg = 0) to a well known
set of addresses (remailers of course) and then randomly replace the
bogus traffic with real traffic in a round robin selection process.
Any real-world realizible system requires(!) at least two remailers who
are not(!) in collusion with each other, and they must share a different
set of keys than either to: or from: might use.
The only workable solution to that, which doesn't involve 'trust' per se,
is to move to a distributed environment with autonomous process execution.
There is of course a discussion of self-sufficiency w/ respect to e-cash
schemes in here, but that's a different topic. Additionaly there is the
Plan 9 process bidding mechanism that fits in here as well. Then you
request a image of that program (which is running other images elsewhere)
to run in your own process space. You can verify the signature of the
image by comparing it to known good signatures (and the algorithm they
were used). This way each image of the program gets 'paid' for by being
run by the user directly (though they have zero control over its environment mind you - excepting hacking the process mechanism in the OS - which recurses to the remailer getting a signature of the OS and itself to verify it hasn't been hacked. Some nifty problem/solution sets in
You could of course do this today with the existing mix-masters to a
certain extent. Linux would of course be a good example, though from a
image used - signature perspective MS would be more stable with all the
custom Linux kernel compiles (and over 180 distro's).

I've also claimed that strictly speaking the Air Force, NASA, NSF, NOAA, etc. are actually unconstitutional. Why? Because the 10th requires some
sort of deligate (at least a sentence fragment) in the Constitution for

@_subject: (LNE) Majordomo results (fwd) 
**** info: unknown list ''.
**** Help for Majordomo at lne.com:
This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
management system at Majordomo at lne.com.
If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced user's summary of
Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this message.
Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe
and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list
You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands
in the body of mail messages addressed to "Majordomo at lne.com".
Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does
not process commands in the subject line.
You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself.
If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail, Majordomo may
mistakenly believe each line of your message is a command; you will
then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening,
either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature,
or put a line with just the word
on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
processing your signature as bad commands.
Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:
I.  Get information about a list.  Use the command
in the body of the mail message to get information about a list.
II.	SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST
Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
list, so you can begin receiving mailings.
To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:
If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
(a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
the command.  For instance, if you're sending a request from your work
account, but wish to receive "demo-list" mail at your personal account
(for which we will use "jqpublic at my-isp.com" as an example), you'd put
the line
in the mail message body.
Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification
that an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message
will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may or may not be the
same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a
command found in that message back to Majordomo at lne.com.  (This can be
a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra
email by someone who forged requests from your address.)  You may also
get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the list owner
for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about who may
subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list owner
should contact you soon after your request.
Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
list policies and features.  Save this message for future reference; it
will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
to Majordomo at lne.com:
(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "demo-list").
III.	UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS
Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:
(This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
address is shown in your mail.)
To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
the request, give that address in the command:
In either of these cases, you can tell Majordomo at lne.com to remove
the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
in place of the list name:
VI.	RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES
Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
may include:
- back issues of the list
- help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
- daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list
To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines
in your mail to Majordomo at lne.com.
VII.	GETTING MORE HELP
To contact a human site manager, send mail to Majordomo-Owner at lne.com.
To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
approval address, which is formed by adding "-approval" to the user-name
portion of the list's address.  For instance, to contact the list owner
for demo-list at lne.com, you would send mail to demo-list-approval at lne.com.
To get another copy of this help message, send mail to Majordomo at lne.com
with a line saying
in the message body.
VIII.	COMMAND SUMMARY FOR ADVANCED USERS
In the description below items contained in []'s are optional. When
providing the item, do not include the []'s around it.  Items in angle
brackets, such as , are meta-symbols that should be replaced
by appropriate text without the angle brackets.
It understands the following commands:
    subscribe  []
    unsubscribe  []
    get          Get a file related to .
    index         Return an index of files you can "get" for .
    info     intro     help
    end
Commands should be sent in the body of an email message to
"Majordomo at lne.com". Multiple commands can be processed provided
each occurs on a separate line.
Commands in the "Subject:" line are NOT processed.
If you have any questions or problems, please contact
"Majordomo-Owner at lne.com".

But 'porn' is no more speech than 'murder' is. What makes porn so
offensive isn't the pictures, but the ACTS that had to be commited to
create the speech. No where in the 1st does it say that you can say and do
anything you want as long as it contains 'speech'. While the 'speech' part
is really irrelevant (and a wrong-headed way to resolve the issues
relating to the acts) there is still the component of the acts against
minors that needs to be dealt with. Those acts are in no way 'speech'.

But they are auto-catalytic. You draw a false distinction that the 'act'
and the 'picture' are somehow disconnected. They are not. Note that I am
not in any way addressing text or artificialy created images, or images
created by consenting adults. Only those which involve a minor. It is the
involvement of a minor which is the deciding line, why? Because they don't
have the life skills/experience/maturity/whatever to make the informed
decision themselves. The act preceedes the speech and as a consequence
looses its protection. It's very like an admission of guilt.
The desire to get the 'speech' is what drives the act. To address one and
ignore the other is simply not reasonable. The images should be taken as
evidence of the act and then destroyed. They should not in and of
themselves be left in circulation to promote further acts.
And no, this does not violate the 1st in spirit or letter.
No, one is not. There is no mention of 'privacy' in the Constitution. It
does talk about 'personal' (and yes, I am aware of the legalistic
quibbling this injects into the discussion - I agree with your equating
'personal' and 'private'  - IANAL.)
And what about the self-determination of the children? How does allowing
porn protect that? It doesn't.
Are we talking 'adult' or 'child'?...world of difference.
The point being, sex between consenting adults isn't 'porn'. It's sex
between consenting adults.
'porn' falls into two categories. Only one of which makes any sense. That
is regarding minors. The other is a religous perspective based on some of
the most twisted Judeo-Christian spin-doctoring around and involves sex
other than between a man and wife in the missionary position in the dark
with their clothes on.

Absolutely the making is 'speech'. The distributing it is 'press'. Only a
lawyer would confuse the two.
Let's look at the situation, if for nothing else to twist your tit ring...
We have a group of persons who commit an act with a child. In the process
a photograph is taken. The photograph is distributed.
Your (ie CACL) claim is that the picture is not itself a crime, and in
particular it is protected as speech.
This assertion is wrong. Here's why.
The person taking the picture was not the only participant who had a say.
Each person in the picture and help create the event had a say. They were
a participant in the 'speech' both in act and recording. The distribution,
or 'press' is a different issue but follows.
Now, the child is clearly a participant in that act as well as a
participant in any claim of 'speech' that might be attributed to the
picture (or recording, or whatever).
Now the standard for expression of ones rights is that you are pretty much
allowed to do whatever you want, until/unless you interfere with another.
Then your right ends, and their right to self defence begins.
Now the child clearly has both a right in the speech aspect as well as the
self-defence aspect.
So, can the child be 'consensual'? No. Children for a variety of reasons
are NOT (and why somebody who claims to be as smart as you do doesn't get
this makes me chuckle, google 'paiget' 'volume') simply 'little adults'
as was so popularly, and universaly held until the later half of this
centry. In other words they don't have the same 'consensual abilities as
adults. Our law recognizes this and provides special protections as a
So, we have a picture, at least one of the participants was forced against
their wishes (or their guardians wishes, select as you may) to
So, can we really claim that the only issue is the right of speech with
respect to the adults? No.
The picture is not protected speech by the simple expedient that it was
constrained or forced upon at least one of the participants.
I guess that 97 percentile doesn't mean as much as you thought.
(this applies equaly to Declan's specious commentary as well)

The framers made no such distinction. A little thought will demonstrate
why such a distinction is specious, and clearly politically motivated.
Any speech which is distinguished as political or not raises a question of
metric. In particular, who and how. Those questions are political by their
very nature. Any speech is political in nature.

It does apply.
Making the picture is speech because it represents an expression.
No, this is sharing, that takes copies, that takes 'press'.
I'm not, simply paraphrasing your C-A-C-L commentary from past discussion.
And the best you can do is 'fat boy'? I'm surprised you made it to 50th
Not at all. My position is that pedophilia, and paraphanalia related to it
is wrong and not protected speech or press. That the material involves a
non-consenting participant and that their self-defence trumps any
individual 'speech' rights you might claim.

One of the ways to model a 'black body' radiator is using this technique.
The point being that the energy of the photons emitted through the hole
have a statistical energy distribution that matches (at least close enough
for experiments) the radiation emission of a black body at a
characteristic temperature.
Actually statistical mechanics, not quite the same thing as quantum
theory. But you can't talk about QT w/o SM.
That should probably be the amount of energy it radiates at particular
Actually not, as Y cools its emissions drop (looking at your example in
reverse). At some point X becomes hotter than Y and the net travel of
photons goes the other way. It's worth remembering that what is actually
happening is that both bodies are emitting radiation continouly, only the
statistical 'average' of the results model this 'one way' flow. Eventually
they'll reach a point where the average energy emitted by one, and
absorbed by the other, equals. From that point both objects will emit
radiation into their surroundings and both will cool until that exchange
The flat radiation of the surface isn't the same as with the hollow
spheres. For the hollow spheres the greatest part of the radiation is
re-absorbed by the relevant body (and re-emitted, and re-absorbed, ...).
This re-adsorption is what leads to the black body behaviour. It acts as
an averaging mechanism. The plates just emit into space and the majority
of radiation is lost, not reabsorbed.

You're missing the parameter where the walls have to be kept at a
temperature T. This implies that your environment around the ball is
controlled. In a lab environment you'd wrap the cavity in some sort of
heater blanket.
To help you get a better grasp of the scale of the effect, consider the
odds of a single photon entering the cavity port from the outside. What is
the odds that that photon will be re-emitted? Almost nill. It effectively
absorbs radiation at all frequencies (hence the 'black' term). Now,
consider the inverse, what is the odd that a photon of a given wavelength
will be emitted? The odds that a perfect black body absorber would radiate
a photon from inside the cavity to the outside environment is also low.
So, to make a black body radiator into a beam weapon implies so much
energy keeping the cavity at the temperature required that it would be
simpler to use that energy directly instead of trying to create a high
energy photon stream from a very(!) inefficient emission process.

I've answered this question before.
I'm not a C-A-C-L. I don't see them as the 'enemy'.
If CJ had really been running around putting bombs in courthouses (in
Canada or not) or was a credible threat to anybody (whether they are
agents are not is irrelelvant, and the distinction is really
unconstitutional) then I WANT him in jail and will happily help put him
I met CJ in person, under some rather strange cirumstances. He also went
out of his way to involve me (eg the bomb description posts to the list he
had on his person when he was captured) and the Austin Cypherpunks. I will
say this, the AC were not impressed by him in general and the general
consensus was he was at least a couple bricks short.
If you want information, you sometimes have to give some.
I operate a remailer for the express purpose of discussing alternatives to
the current approaches to our society. Part of that is the willingness to
involve myself with people, even if the odds of success are very low. I
asked myself how credible I'd be if I ran around deciding I'd talk to this
group but not that group. I felt, not very.
Everything I said came from voluntary and reasonably public comments made
by the appropriate parties over several years of interaction (I joined the
original list in late '92 or early '93). Nothing I said can't be backed up
by reams of posts.
Finally, I'm more worried about my butt than yours or Timmy's.
It was a personal judgement call, one that I believe I resolved equitably.
If you don't agree, tough. It wasn't your call. (the fact that you want
respect for your actions but can't seem to give it to others is only
another indication of your real world view)
Basically, I don't see it in the same immature black/white:us/them view
that you and your cronnies hold. It ain't a football game, goober.

It was the first cite I cam across that mentioned the 'gets so small that
nobody cares' aspect...suited my purposes just dandy. Within that sentence
is another whole aspect of the 'fair n-slice problem', for example; how
does it get small? Consider the situation where you have a cake and
n-people and use a scale to measure the slices. The goal being to get them
all weighing the same within some measure of error. An associated
question is, given a starting quantity (q), a number of players (n), and
a given error (dq), what is the maximum number of 'slice and dices' you
will need to go through? How does that change when it's a fixed percentage
by volume error (ie %g/g)? Or perhaps (as likely with people) a fixed
minimum volume that one can resolve (while this reduces for homogenious
quantities, what happens when it's heterogenous)? From a applications
perspective this seems like a pretty important issue.

Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH
Dawn Xiaodong Song, David Wagner, Xuqing Tian
University of California, Berkeley
SSH is designed to provide a security channel between two hosts. Despite the encryption and authentication mechanisms it uses, SSH has two weakness: First, the transmitted packets are padded only to an eight-byte boundary (if
a block cipher is in use), which reveals the approximate size of the original data. Second, in interactive mode, every individual keystroke that a user types is sent to the remote machine in a separate IP packet immediately after the key is pressed, which leaks the interkeystroke timing information of users' typing. In this paper, we show how these seemingly minor weaknesses result in serious security risks.
First we show that even very simply statistical techniques suffice to reveal sensitive information such as the length of users' passwords or even root passwords. More importantly, we further show that using more advanced statistical techniques on timing information collected from the network, the eavesdropped can learn significant information about what users type in SSH sessions. In particular, we perform a statistical study of users' typing patterns and show that these patterns reveal information about the keys typed. By developing a Hidden Markov Model and our key sequence prediction algorithm, we can predict key sequences from the interkeystroke timings. We further develop and attacker system, Herbivore, which tried to learn users' passwords by monitoring SSH sessions. By collecting timing information on the network, Herbivore can speed up exhaustive search for passwords by a factor of 50. We also propose some countermeasures.
In general our results apply not only to SSH, but also to general class of protocols for encrypting interactive traffic. We show that timing leaks open a new set of security risks, and hence caution must be taken when designing this type of protocol.

(For this discussion we will only include the rules portion.) It must make (sometimes conflicting) decisions that affect the lives of those it has justification over.
A poorly designed legal system, in the worst case scenerio, can wreak a society as much as, or worse than, an outbreak of war or uncontrollable disease. Less extreme cases can usually result in, but not limited, to the following:
1) bureaucratic inefficiency processing legal cases
2) the conviction of innocent parties
3) the non-remedy or incorrect remedy of undisireable behaviour
4) the inability to implement the rules and remedies
5) in the inefficient method of settlements between the wronged parties and the guilty ones.
One would also find it difficult to comply with a poorly designed legal system, for a legal system exists to reduce undesirable behavior against the values of society, and not to make as many things as undisireable as possible thus increasing the cost of participating in that society unneccessarily.
Our current legal systems operates much like an expert system, with thick rule books and lots of lawyers. The assumption behind this seems that, you can patch all the holes on the legal system if you have enough rules. However, according to Gï¿?el's Incompleteness Theorm, such an undertaking would prove furtile because no one set of a system of rules can provide both a consistent structure nor a complete one.
This means, if you want a "fair" (as in consistent) laws and yet want these laws to cover everything, then dream on. Yet, the legal system continues, apparently unaware of this contradiction.
We had not also figured out the problem of having to learn and memorise such huge rule sets. Who (other than people working directly in the legal system and those with photographic memory, of course) can reasonably remember an encyclopedia's worth of such rules? Yet common law clearly states that ignorance of the law cannot excuse one from legal liability.
With each day, as new developments appear in our world that never existed previously which create new legal implications, the rule book only gets deeper. We also have a corresponding book of case laws that get even thicker still. Somehow, it would seem redicious to expect everyone to know all these rules.
Hence, I propose using the following systems in combination:
- Heuristic System
A heuristically based legal system would operate based on objectives instead of rules. First, we have to start from what we want to achieve. We may want to ensure our freedom (such as of the ability to publish freely (i.e. right of free speech)), or we may simply want to prevent overcrowding on buses that could increase accident rates.
Firstly, we must determine the fundemental objectives a society wishes to achieve, which we may call a society's value. These should not have too large a number or they will introduce additional complexities and perhaps inconsistents to the legal system. These principles will definitely create ambigulities, because of the "complete" nature.
We could include the following varieties:
1) Certain Freedom(s) (e.g. to publish freely, to self-actualise)
2) Persuit of Happiness
3) Preservation of the status quo
For each of those we choose or all of them, we must describe a vivid, accurate vision of how a society implementing these rules will look like. We cannot merely declare that one has the "right" to life, or liberty, or happiness, but we must describe and show our vision of a future society operate on these principles to clarify what we mean.
Going a step further, we then create a counter-vision, a dystrophic society that implements the opposite rules that we have. We also create a third vision, of someone managing to twist the principles of our society to their opposities, and what syndromes and problems will arrive with this. With this, we fight ambiguity with ambiguity which will hopefully tell us if we had made the right choice.
One (usually the founding members) must choose these principles carefully, for to change them would actually mean a change in the entire society and the systems of rules, introducing great instabilities. The same goes for the vision of the society, which one may update in accordance with future technology but not change.
Secondly, we have to state our objectives, and then we derive a set of general rules to prevent that. For instance, we could specify a certain formula for the vehicle overloading and allow the owners to compute the exact weight and approximate number of people, instead of declaring an arbitrary and ambiguous amount (such as 150 adults or 300 children). For this case, we may also specify that we wish to reduce pain and suffering by reducing the amount of accidents.
For the problem "free speech", we can specify we want free disclosure of information and ideas and then work towards how to make it happen, for instance, by creating a low cost, efficient and non-censored information distribution system that everyone has access to, and then requiring people to publish dually (one copy to the media source they want to publish, and the other to the information system). Note that this concept of "free speech" may again, sound too ambiguous for us to formulate a system to adequately address it.
Lastly, the set of general rules must not exceed a certain length and complexity that would in total, take more than a week to learn and understand. They must exist as clearly worded as possible, so that one cannot read multiple interpretions into them. Most importantly, they should exist in the public domain, easily accessible and easily referenced, unlike our current law books. All rules should use this system first, before others.
- Expert System
A expert system acts as a system of second resort, if heuristics cannot solve an issue. It does not neccessarily alleviate Gï¿?el's problem, however, it provides a quick and easy way for one to look up information based on rules without having to consult lawyers and other legal experts who may have a certain bias or incomplete data. It also provides a great substitute to a human judge, which may have biases and insufficient time to handle all cases fast enough.
We first assume that we encode our current set of minimum rules into a consistent set of items. We flag ambiguous areas, when we or the system encounters them, and allow users to make a decision about choosing to choose which side of the ambiguity to continue with. The system will also take in decisions made by the legal system previously in helping it to determine the course of action.
When the one has a case against him or another, one can simply consult the system, entering the relevant data as the system asks for information. After one has completed the data entry, one should get a rough decision against or for one, or at least probabilistic decision. This decision will also contain summaries and links to full details of the rules explaining the reasoning it uses to arrive at the decision(s).
Thus the legal system should also have the aim of reducing the amount of ambiguity in its decisions. This system will demostrate whether a legal system can meet this standard.
- Intellicratic
An intellicratic system can function in two modes:
1) as a system of last resort, in the absense of a pre-existing legal principles applying to a certain problem
In this case the legal system will post all details to the public as an Request for Solutions (RFS). The public will debate and rule over the judgment. After this, we can insert the judgment into the expert system.
2) in the redesign of a system of heuristics or the expert system
In the event of the discovery that a certain subset of rules do not further the core values of a society. If a rule does not further the core values, then this rule must crease to exist. The public will rule over the pros and cons of the rule and the remedy, if any, against this problem that the outcasted rule ought to protect.
Once a ruling had occured, this information will enter the expert system and help define future related issues.
Hence, I had proposed how a possible improved legal system could operate. For more data about Intellicracy, please refer to sociologistics.webhop.org

BREAKING A QUANTUM SYMMETRY ON THE TABLETOP.
A recurrent theme in art and science, the concept of symmetry has
become a powerful scientific tool for the analysis of physical
systems.  However, under special circumstances, a "quantum
anomaly" occurs: the laws of quantum physics break a system's
apparent symmetry.  After a long search, a research group (Horacio
Camblong, University of San Francisco, camblong at usfca.edu, and
collaborators at Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina) has
found a relatively simple example of a quantum anomaly: the
interaction of a polar molecule with an electron.  A polar molecule,
despite being neutral, has a permanent separation of electric
charge--a dipole.  This dipole produces an electric field, which can
capture electrons if it is strong enough.  Can such an arrangement
exist as a stable ion, with its "extra" electron?  The researchers
formulated the answer to this question in the language of
symmetry.  In physics, symmetry means that a system, such as the
molecule-electron arrangement, behaves the same after you
perform a change to it, such as stretching the molecule to larger
scales and making appropriate adjustments to other variables in the
system.  At first glance, the electron-molecule interaction exhibits
a remarkable scale invariance: the system "looks" the same when
viewed from different scales in space and time--at least in a
classical physics description which treats the molecule as a dipole
and the electron as a point of charge.  But this tidy picture breaks
down with a proper treatment of the system, as prescribed by
quantum field theory.  A quantum field theory treatment requires
the process of renormalization, which removes certain
mathematical infinities and inconsistencies from the quantum
approach. This process also makes the molecule's energy levels
discrete or quantized rather than continuous.  Examining the
system this way, the researchers found that the scale invariance
broke down.  In fact, a large body of existing evidence, both
experimental and numerical, supports their conclusion.  While all
other known quantum anomalies occur at high energies (an
example is chiral symmetry in nuclear physics), the work suggests
that quantum symmetry breaking can occur at much lower
energies, in the domain of interacting electrons and molecules. (Camblong et al., Physical Review Letters, 26 November 2001.)

If the sending node doesn't know about the destination node, how does it
konw where to send the traffic (even if the sender provides the address)?
The reality is that the remailers must 'know' of each other one way or
another. Simply being part of a 'remailer network' (anonymous or not)
tends to already put one in a 'conspiratorial' situation.
Truly robust remailers MUST be located in domains that protect speech and
association with something similar to 'innocent until proven innocent'.
That's the only defence against 'conspiracy'.

Merry Christmas to you too.
The same key it shares with everyone else (all users to anon_1 use the
same key - bad!!! idea). Allows you to build up a big library of
plain-cypher pairs, and if you send it to yourself you can attack their
private key as well.
And it can't encrypt that outgoing traffic since it doesn't have the key
to the destination (I assume the user must nest these themselves). This
represents a lot of work for the initiator of a email, especially if
they're in a 'sensitive' situation. Too big a 'signature' (the traffic
analysis kind).
The sender having to know all the steps is a major threat to the standard
remailer model. In fact it's one of the major shorcomings with the current
approaches. The sender should at most be able to set the number of
remailers, not which ones. That way there's on evidence sitting around on
their machines (and you can posit throwing the keys away each time - but
then you have to go out and get them again...and around and around we go).
One of the primary points of any remailer technology should be to minimize
the threat to the user. This model doesn't.

There is a difference between stating the basic principle and stating that
the principle is acted upon. Were the principle acted upon we wouldn't be
having these discussions in the first place.
We ALMOST ALL agree that the principles are not being followed. That in no
way detracts from the principles (eg very few follow the CACL philosophy
therefore it must not be 'true').

thank you for the kind consideration of our work.
How many images are posted to Usenet every day? I'd say around 50,000
a day, including GIF images and other image file types that we did not
look at [1].
Which USENET archive that stores a full feed from the time before
steganography suddenly hit the limelight of the press would you use?
We had access to a couple of Terra bytes accounting for a few months
of Usenet activity.  Thats what we looked at.
You might have heard that Usenet traffic is mostly for binary data.
That is correct but most of the binary traffic is not in images [2].
If you have any suggestions on how to increase the scope of our
analysis, I would be glad to hear them.  Alternatively, you might
conduct a study yourself as I just released most of my tools.  It
would be interesting to see something more "statistically significant" ;)

coins do you have in your pocket right now? I'll wager asymptotic to nill.
Actually the payment for the fee for the assayist and the mint aren't
likely to come out of the metal they are processing today. Now if we were
talking of a 'frontier' sort of situation then you wouldn't have those
fees going back into circulation, at least not immediately. In that case
the 'cut' would be collected over some suitable period of time and then
sold. Or the assayist could simply take their cut on the upstream broker
payment (this assumes of course they have sufficient liquid capital in
hand). But these examples, at least from the perspective of the money changer are
dealing with effectively 'unlimited' cash pools to draw from.
Your objections to Adams points don't hold.

Bullshit, We're talking AMATEUR ROCKETS here folks. Beside, irrespective
of the actual size of the rocket it will be in LEO way before it gets to
Clearly you folks have no clue to the distinction between government,
commercial, amateur. Russia, I agree. Europe is uncool. Hell the Germans outlawed amateur
rocketry in the late 30's and haven't looked back once.
The Gulf is deeper than the North Sea and I'd bet the rigs we got out here
are just as big.
No, you need a boat. Sealand is more than sufficient for putting a Amateur
rocket up. Hell, I could fire one from my back yard as far as that goes.
Though I think the launch tower might give somebody a clue.
While the rest of you folks sit around telling yourself the same old

Not being a 'human' language is not sufficient to prove it is encrypted,

Let me tell you how the Rabin system works in the Crypto 99 paper.
I'll do it as pseudo code and copy it to BXA so everything is kosher.
Basically they generate a one time pad by xoring a random subset of the
message bits, where the subset indices are agreed upon in advance by
the communicants:
Security Parameter k // Error probability = 1/2^(k/5)
Random data length PER MESSAGE BIT n = 5E // E is maximum size of adversary memory
Message Length m //bits
Message M = {M_1, ..., M_m} // m bits long
Secret key s = {sig_1, ... sig_k} // each in range 1-n, k of them
Random data alpha[n][m]  // n*m bits long
One Time Pad X[m]  // Will be xored with M
for i = 1 to m do
  for j = 1 to n do
    if j is an element of s then
      R and S store alpha[j][i]
  end for j
  S and R set X[i] = xor of stored alpha[j][i] values (k of them)
  S sends M[i] xor X[i]; R recovers M[i] by xoring with X[i]
end for i
For each message bit M_i we need to use 5*E random bits, where E is the
estimate of the maximum amount of memory the adversary can hold.
For example if Eve can store 100 Tbits, we need to use up 500 Tbits of
data for each message bit.  To send say a 1 Mbit message that is, well,
it's a lot.  500 exabits.  (It goes giga, tera, peta, exa.  Then zetta
and yotta.)
The initial shared secret key is simply k indexes in the range 1-n,
where k is the security parameter such that the guaranteed probability of
failure is bounded by 1/2^(k/5).  k = 300 would give a security level of
2^60.  The size of the initial shared secret key is therefore k log n, so
with k = 300 and n = 2^49 as above, this is about 15000 shared key bits.
So I would say no, this 1999 scheme is not practical.  Maurer's original
approach used only n random bits in total, not n bits per message bit,
but it did not have as strong provability.  The authors leave it as an
open problem whether they can achieve similar levels of provable security
using n bits total, which would make it much more practical.
Maybe the new result presented in the Times fixes this problem and reduces
the data quantity to something sane.

Interesting. Something I came up with may be relevant -
I explained this to Ian Goldberg, who agreed that both conjectures are
completely obvious, and also couldn't see a way of proving them.
If anyone could forward this around I'd much appreciate it - it seems like
worthwile work, but I haven't figured out how to even try to get it
published anywhere - even the front outright ignores submissions from
people with no academic affiliation.

The problem I see with doing this, is that it doesn't stop someone absent-mindedly sending out an unencrypted mail to the list server. Which then will travel happily in the clear over the Internet to the list server, (where it gets encrypted and sent back out again but its too late by then).
so I'm coming round to the idea that the only way to do this is via a web-driven interface on a secure server.

They are open to 'artificial star' attacks using lasers and the upper
atmosphere. They  are currently used in the Keck for example as 'adaptive
optics' so they can correct for distortions in the atmosphere. They use a
fixed amplitude beam and measure the variations, the opposite tack of
using a variable beam could induce non-randomness into the stream.

@_subject: Remailer Functions (Re: Testing for encryption. (fwd)) 
Which raises an interesting question for me, Plan 9 has no remailer and
I've decided to take that on as a first project. However, I want to
combine the features of say majordomo with several different sorts of
anonymity (ranging from stripping From: headers to full encryption). For
the time being I'm refering to it as 'igor'.
I believe fundamentally that putting routing info in the body of the
traffic is evil. So I intend to use the Subject: with default delimiters
(ie [igor: *]). So if you wanted to send to SSZ CDR under igor and strip
your headers the command might be Subject: Foobar [igor: strip_header].
The [*] is itself always stripped. There will also be a no_log that won't
log the receipt or transmission in any system file. You could of course
chain commands. While I do intend to allow igor to use a 'set' of trusted
remailers using PKE the actual selection of remailers will be decided by
the listproc and not the user. They'll only be able to do, for example,
[igor: encrypt, mix, strip_header, no_log, check_pgp]
This would for example encrypt the body using the inter-igor PK's. It
would send the email w/ cover traffic to some number of remailers (maybe
mix_# also?). It would strip the header before it did anything so in
effect the recipient will see the last remailers header and that's it. No
log would instruct all igor nodes to not log the traffic. And finally it
would ensure that the original source traffic fit the PGP format (it would
support other algorithms through loadable modules.
Inter-igor traffic relating to a particular piece of mail would be wrapped
around the actual traffic under question (the body would never be touched
by igor's hands directly). I've still not decided exactly what scope this
command set will cover.
With respect to mix, what I intend is each igor will have a list of
trusted single-hop receivers. It will randomly select n (or m if n>m) of
these and use the PK's to encrypt the traffic. It will only send/receive
from this trusted list. So if you tell igor to use 3 layers of remailer
then each node can only know of it's immediate neighbors and won't have
any way of determining where any neighbor received it from (Yes, the
wording of the last couple of sentences is a tad vague).
It will of course support the sorts of features that majordomo has as
What other sorts of features might be useful?

 I wonder what was used to encrypt the letter and how they were able to
decrypt it. Did he give them the password? Was the encryption weak (it would
be funny if he had used DES)? Blah blah blah...
 Our (I'm US) govt. can't even keep its own members from spying on it.
Yet they have a problem with us exporting crypto tools so that mom and dad
can buy their goods over the net? Or they are afraid that terrorists will
get ahold of something they can download off the net already. Hmmm...gotta

Somebody does something. As a consequence another party is considered to
have contributed to the first persons act, without actually participating
in the act.
So, if the first person is not fully responsible, why is the second
party fully responsible? How do you test this?
If a party whose actions contribute is responsible for the consequences
then isn't the censor themselves, since they take an active role, also
Doesn't this put a party in the defence in the role of presecutor and
judge? That seems to be a considerable conflict of interest.

I forgot to mention in my earlier reply that the Maghribi themselves were
Jewish. It's worth noting that all three religions rely on the same basic
texts, just selected and ordered differently. The major distinction
between them is how to order and interpret, not fundamental doctrine (ie
God, Satan, do good to your fellows, do various things to your enemies,
It's really more a segregation made according to 'state' (ie major
religious interpretation) based upon economic pragmatism.

No, they don't. They do need a persistent network presence however.
Distinctly different things.
Which is pointless. The only(!) group that is excluded from IRC at this
point is anyone who doesn't have the brains to request a session key
through the server.
Using pk's doesn't do this since I can loan my key as easy as I might own
a password. Besides how do you know somebody isn't diddling with the
central server?
Any centralized system is bound to be defeated through a 'least effort'
attack on the servers. As a result of the server going down the entire
system has now been breached and the trust in the operators is nil.

STOCK MARKET: FOLLOW THE LEADER
To make money in the stock market, you have to understand risk.
Physicists have been using statistical physics methods to analyze
markets in order to better understand market risks, such as the
probability that a large shift in market value will occur during a
year-long interval. Real markets have a higher probability of
experiencing large changes than conventional "pure chance" would
predict, and econophysicists have suggested many schemes to explain
this fact. The latest idea, reported in the 25 December PRL, points
to the "herding behavior" for which traders are famous. The authors
describe a simple computer model where information networks grow
randomly until entire "clusters" of traders act on the news and then
wait for the next "rumor mill" to grow. The model predicts price
fluctuations similar to those of real markets.

I think most, that entertainment value is what helped at least in part to
make their discussion palitable. After all it follows if the book is both
popular and influencial it is actually changing peoples mind.
Wells was contemporanious with the growth of atomic physics. I think it's
more likely a cose of being too close.
Actualy it gives us a reason, both reasoned and emotional, to consider
alternatives like 'harm'. They're more pragmatic and easier to define
across social belief systems. Things like murder, rape, & theft are pretty
common. Then we include concepts like freedom of religion and speech and
we begin to see a framework where a multi-cultural society can exist. It
allows the keeping of local 'web-of-trusts' while at the same providing a
more general framework for commerce and human experession.
I think the operable point is 'same premises'. The true test of a theory
is when the parties start at different premises.
A more specific form of socialism.
Oh, not at all. I'm simply saying that considering human nature any
society that isn't paranoid isn't going to last long. Like it or not
(personaly I'm rather fond of it) the human animal is a predator. A damn
smart, ruthless, cold-blooded, determined killer. That is one of the prime
facts as to why we got to where we are. This realization is one of the
reasons I'm interested in the subject.
No, I actually expect to see a growth in the desire for anonymity. As
people realize the true extend of data mining and the extent of both
commercial and government databases they will become more paranoid. People
will finaly come to realize explicitly that freedom IS security (which
I've always felt was the point behind Franklin's quote).
I've always felt these predictions didn't understand the fundamental
nature of the network requirements. The current internet and OS technology simply isn't up to it.
Ok, I've spoken poorly. I'm not talking of the society per se but rather
the network that it is built upon. If we follow the current model Lessig's
point of regulation by compiler will come to pass. However, if instead we
have a network infrastructure that is end to end developed Open Source it
provides no room to regulate. Lawmakers can't as a matter of course pass a
law dictating what network stack you might use (at least in the US). That
would provide a base for a more humane and reasonable society. A society
where freedom of expression and social responsibility are balanced as they
should be (at least under the 4th).
I'll have to disagree, it's a statistical mechanical problem. Not
deterministic at all. One of the primary memes, and primary problems, is
this point. It's almost like talking to DeCarte.
I don't see the relevancy.
Because within the arcology the society can set its own norms while at the
same time interacting with others. The question is what holds such an
arcology together? A strong common culture.
Actually for the arcology/zaibatsu to exist will require nanotechnology
and several other technologies to become practical. If we don't develop
then the entire process is fall down because the resource base won't
expand as fast as the need. Without the technology there is no way to
address the need.
Just remember, 20 generations is effectively billions. Consider that
society when it has moved off planet based societies and begun to process
extra-planetary resources. Lifetimes potentially moving toward the 500
year mark, genetic engineering to build custom chimeras. Consider the
potential for ark's with artificial wombs, stem cell management, and gene
Well that would depend on a family by family basis. In general what one
can say is that it will build a social structure where children visit
their grandparents for much farther than through their teens. And on for
the great grandparent...
Won't fly, but I'd like to hear your description of the driving forces...
What 'large bumps'? Considering that most generations will be 20-30 years
apart in age (at least at first, expect the age between generations to
extend outward). In addition the additional storage of culture will act as
a mediating affect.
So be it. Remember, something must happen. It will happen as a result of
cause/effect and random events.
I'm not predicting disaster, a slow lingering drown on ones own waste.

I have a question. I want to use GnuPG (or any suitable open source
alternative) to encrypt a credit card to store in a database. The client
wants to decrypt them on the server and view them over an SSL connection. I
can encrypt without a problem, but to decrypt I know I at least need the
passphrase, but then that makes me leave the private key on the server
(bad!). Is there a way to send both the passphrase and private key to the
Perl GnuPG interface and have it decrypted in memory to send via SSL?
We're trying to avoid having the client install the decryption software on
their desktop (client's being such as they are) and just provide either the
private key or the passphrase/Private key.

They also tend to be larger than the original as well. Though there has
been some progress in understanding why recently. Some other issues might
be pointed at in the recent 'jellyfish monkey' experiments. Of the
embryos, the only viable one didn't express the jellyfish gene, those that
did - died.
Take a look at Dougal Dixons 'Man After Man' book for some examples of
what scares the hell out of them. A (mediocre) sci-fi book that has the

All children are 'natural' clones (as if one could have an unnatural

identical clones with each parent (and 25% for each grandparent).

It is only 'reasonable' if you have probably cause. Let's take the example
of the cop standing on the corner with a photograph (obstensibly the same
as computer searches). That photo is of a particular person who has
particular characteristics. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the
person in the photo is a white, blonde, male. The police officer isn't
going to stop blacks, hispanics, women, children, etc.
However, the automated system does exactly this. They are not searching
for a 'particular person' as required by the 4th, they are searching
everyone for instances in the police records. Clearly non-conformal to the
wording of the 4th.

Neither. The wording of the question indicates a deep ignorance of data
conversion and data set analysis. I suggest a good study course in A/D
data conversion techniques as well as statistical correlation analysis.
"Biometric Data" is the conversion of analog parameters converted to
digital data and stored. It is used under the premise that by applying yet
another algorithm (as opposed to the data conversion mechanism) the 1-to-1
correspondance between data set and individual can be proven.

The fact is that if clonning research is stopped then the low success rate
will continue. A self-fulfilling prophecy. If it is allowed to go forward
in a very short time (a year perhaps) the problems will be ironed out and
the success rate will exceed 'natural' (Grrrr Judeo-Christian ethics)
rates of success.

ITALY Public Announcement
July 3, 2001
the G-8 Summit, a meeting among heads of state and government from eight
nations including the United States.  There will be thousands of government
officials, press representatives, and security personnel in Genoa.
In addition, it is estimated that from fifty to eighty thousand or more
demonstrators will be present before and during the Summit meeting period.
As at past international meetings it is likely that some of the
demonstrators will become disorderly or violent.  If that occurs, clashes
could result in injuries and/or arrests.
Italian officials are working to minimize the potential for disruption.
Access to many areas of the city, including well-known tourist sites, will
be closed to the general public.  Travelers to and through Genoa are likely
to experience delays, detours, and limitations on their movement due to
traffic and other restrictions.  Travelers scheduled to arrive in or depart
from Genoa via train, ferry, cruise ship, or plane during the Summit period
should confirm with their companies whether there have been changes in their
travel arrangements or instructions regarding travel to or from their points
of arrival or departure.
U.S. citizens, other than those with official Summit-related duties, should
avoid travel to Genoa during the Summit period.  Those who must travel to
Genoa, should exercise caution, avoid any crowds or demonstrations, and
monitor the local media to keep informed.
The U.S. Embassy in Rome is located at Via Veneto 119A, telephone (24 hours)
(39) 06-46741, fax (39) 06-4674-2217.
The U.S. Consulate General in Milan is located at Via Principe Amadeo 2/10,
telephone (39) 02-290351, fax (39) 02-2900-1165, and after-hours telephone

The rental agency has no(!!!) authority under law to enforce speeding
regulations. If they find that a leasee has violated a law by getting a
ticket or whatever then they certainly have the right to protect their
property by refusing or raising rates on future rentals, but to impose
'fines' is simply wrong, they do not represent the civil authority in
charge of the road. It would certainly be sufficient evidence to bring
charges of reckless driving or whatever, but the final determination of
'guilt' and the consequences thereof are up to the CIVIL authorities and
not the owner of the property.

No, it isn't. While police certainly need 'probably cause' to institute a
search there are NO (zero, nadah, nil, nul, none) requirements on citizens
to wear any particular part or type of clothing (or not wear it even). Any
such law would violate the 1st.

Since I own my private vehicle then I have the 'right by owner' to give

The DCchat program I wrote about a couple of weeks ago is ready for test It is available at   It is written in Python and
requires threads and Tkinter support built in.
I ended up leaving out the "nym" feature, all messages are anonymous.  Mostly
at this point I want to know if it works with moderate numbers of users Can the DC net scale?  When does it fall apart?
Any questions please feel free to ask.  Perhaps people could agree on a to try a chat?
If you want to try chatting, first run the program once ahead of time and it will
create your host key in a file hostkey.pub.  You can post that and users can check
to see if it is present in the list.  Eventually I hope to automate this checking to
some degree, a la ssh.

Not only is it a logical fallicy, but a legal one as well. It's all(!) a
personal choice. Saying "I passed this law I knew was unconstitutional
because it was the only thing I could think of" doesn't excuse the abuse.
ONLY individuals have that right...it's a pity we've lost the true meaning
of 'American Democracy'. Just too radical for most folks I guess.
     When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
     people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
     with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the
     separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of
     Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
     mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
     them to the separation.
     We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
     pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments
     are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
     consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government
     becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People
     to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
     its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
     such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
     Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
     Governments long established should not be changed for light and
     transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that
     mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
     than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
     accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
     pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce
     them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their
     duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for
     their future security.

How? The only ethical way would be to either put a govenor on the vehicle
or else have somebody ride along with you. Otherwise they'd just have to
trust the civil authorities to catch speeders.
Not necessarily, there is an issue of cognisence and alternative. For
example, let's say that the contract says 65 max, but somebody goes 85.
How's the company going to know?
Within limits, yes. The question is where are the limits.

Actually it's not, it's a strawman to draw in more income.
If the auto vendor was really concerned about their vehicle they'd install
a govenor (like they did on the '64 1/2 Mustand for example) that would
limit the RPM's of the engine. Quick, easy, simple. A lot(!!!) less
expensive (about $20) and more reliable than a GPS receiver.
It's the typical bait and switch (typical of capitalist/libertarian goals
that is).
What's an example of why this process won't work? Consider the GPS is set
for 55MPH and the customer is doing exactly 50MPG (hence not being shown
as a speeder) but is in a 30MPH zone.

Why is there no mention in the contract of:
- Providing the customer the data upon return to the shop for review
- A dispute mechanism (heavily used I predict)
- Why should the auto manufacturer know all the places I've been in their
  car, what if the locations are business sensitive
- Can the rental agency sell that data to others
- Is it ethical to sell the data to the drivers regular insurance carrier
  even though there is no indication that the behaviour in the rental
  auto is comparable to behaviour in their own car (I know lots of people
  who figure 'I paid the insurance and it ain't my car, what the hell')
- And who arbitrates the dispute, clearly it shouldn't be the rental
  agency as they have a vested interest
The typical Libertarian approach is to support whatever puts the primary
service provider (Libertarians almost always use producer-consumer
examples, why is that?) in the primary profit making position and the
service consumer in the least protected position. The typical Libertarian
figures that if you can make a buck of the sucker, then any failure or
harm in the contract by the provider is the dumb blind luck of the
The concept of 'fair' is a pretty rare concept for most Libertarians.
Then again, what is 'fair'? (Being a Pantheist the concept of 'absolute
right/wrong' is foreign to me, only within the concept of human psychology
and a specific social milieu is it definable)

The point being, there are plenty of historical precidence where this sort
of behaviour has led directly to the change desired by the protestors
against a much better armed and entrenched foe.
Highly heirarchial defence mechanisms, such as you tout as invincible,
work just fine when faced with that sort of competition. When faced with a
more distributed and idealistic confrontation they eventualy fail.
The question is not one of tactics, but of spirits.

Have you looked at Plan 9? It would allow you to run the 'mint' as a
independent distributed service for all users that actually runs as no
user. It would require a 'virtual filespace' so the requisite binaries and
such don't reside on any one machine, not native but that's doable as
well. Once started, as long as there were any Plan 9 process/file spaces
available the service would 'live'.

Well see...
What is 'obscene'?
What is 'pornography'?
As to the 'child' part of that, any interaction with a minor in any way
without parental consent should be grounds for immediate hanging (just
What two or more consenting adults do is between them and nobody else.
                                 Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
                                Amendment IX
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
                                 Amendment X
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people.
Now a couple of questions for you...
Where in the Constitution does it say the fed's are supposed to regulate
pornography or sex?
Where in the Constitution does it draw a distinction with regard to 'the
people' between adults and minors?
The 10'th Amendment clearly makes these issues STATE issues, not federal
Simply because a bunch of religious fascist/socialist wanna do it don't
make it right.

Some answers are question, even if one doesn't recognize, like, or want to
accept it.
It has to cross a state boundary. Prove that ALL pornography crosses state
boundaries. Prove that one mans 'pornography' is the same as every other
mans 'pornography', otherwise you're breaking the 1st by supporting
specific 'religions'.
You're an ass.
Where in the Constitution does it give the SCOTUS the job of claiming ANY
jurisdiction outside of the 10th?

Another observation about our 'implimentation' of the Constitution...
Since we live in a democracy based on 'consent' (1st 2 para's DoI) and the
concept of 'life, liberty, pursuit of happiness' coupled with 'shall not
interfere with others expression' as axiomatic concepts of American
democracy it isn't too hard to understand that we don't live there.
What we have is a system that is focused on ways around the Constitution
based on 'good of society' concepts. The base problem with them is the a
priori assumption that the Constitution doesn't work and needs to be
worked around in the first place. People don't believe that a 'free
market' social system like American Democracy doesn't work.
This is not a new character however, as Jefferson said;
I am not one of those who fear the people.
Anyone who talks of 'idiots', 'sheep', 'naive', 'just don't understand',
'minimal economic impact', etc. are typical examples of those who
fundamentaly don't believe in a 'free market' concept (and not
paradoxically who'll sell your rights for profit - to reword Jefferson a American democracy predicates axiomatically that, yes there are some
really stupid people out there but whatever their performance level it's
going to be better than you making decisions for them.
What we have today is a rampant rush to 'security' not through free market
social mechanisms but through a 'control economy' sort of society.
You'd have thought all these (supposedly) bright people could look at the
CCCP, China, Cuba, etc. examples and put 2 and 2 together.
Alas, Jefferson was right, there are no angels...just a bunch of predatory
assholes. (and people wonder why othe people who feel abused riot in the
streets, I wonder how their attitude would change when the mop handle was up their butthole?)
....'the people' doesn't apply to the 'individual' indeed.
What does that second para of the DoI say about a citizens duty?
And on the topic of 'limiting felons rights', where in the Constitution
does it give the federal government any regulatory action over rights? It
gives them a bunch of jobs and directs them to comply with the laws and
treaties made UNDER the Constitution (which has this nifty 9'th
Amendment). Where in the Constitution is the word 'felon' (or a synonym
thereof) even used? (if you can't find it, find the 10'th and ponder that
baby for a moment)

Reply-To: alg at austinlug.org
The ALG key signing party will take place on Thursday July 26 2001.
In order to participate in the party, please take the following
(A) if you have not done so already, generate a GPG/PGP key for yourself.
    The precise command for this varies with your version of GPG/PGP.
    Consult the documentation for your version.
(B) email your public key to me by noon the day before the party July 25.
    Please indicate in your subject line the nature of the message.
    For example, Subject: KEY FOR KEY-SIGNING PARTY.
    If you use more that one key you can submit more than one, but
    be reasonable.
    I will use these keys to prepare a list of key IDs and
    fingerprints which will facilitate the party. I will Xerox
    this list.
(C) Bring 2 things to the party:
    (a) your GPG/PGP key fingerprint(s)
        This will be used to verify that people are being
        asked to sign the public key that you want them to sign.
    (b) Identification, preferably picture identification to
        The party will be run according to the non-coercion
AFTER THE PARTY, everyone will have a list of public keys and key
finger prints that they have decided it is OK to sign.
I will have added all the public keys that were sent to me to the
public key servers. I will also email the public keys used in the party
to this list, in case anyone does not have access to the public key
servers.  You will be able to get the public keys that you wish to
sign from any public key server.
They should sign these public keys and make the signatures public.
Please email the signed public keys to me and I will compile the
signed public keys for the use of ALG. Please use the subject line:
I will also add these now SIGNED keys to the GPG/PGP public
key servers.
If you wish, you can also send the signed public keys to
the public key servers your own self. -:)

Wrong. See that phrase 'private financial gain'? That means that any(!!!) activity, private or commercial, which reduces
the cash flow INTO the corporation is a legitimate target. So simply
talking about it is most definitely a crime. So, while in this case they
may not have decided to go this route, the route is still there.

There was an article in IEEE Spectrum last year (I think) on one of the
systems. The main failure mechanism is weakening of the aeroshell and due
to increased loading the missile comes apart. The same sort of thing
happened in Desert Storm with some of the Scuds that used plywood sheeting
instead of aluminum. It's one of the primary factors of their high failure
It's the one they use primarily.
While reflecting the thermal energy is a good idea, doing the same for
radar isn't since it allows more conventional systems to be used to track
the missile, contrary to the goal of delivering large quantities time on
target. Of course reflecting the IR allows one to use a 'dual component'
system whereby another missile homes in on the reflected laser (standard
IR designator sort of stuff).
Another aspect is to beam the exhaust. By creating hydrodynamic shockwaves
in the exhaust cone it should become possible to cause the engine to come
apart due to back-pressure or simply creating ancillary thrust vectors
and causing the guidance system to mis-calculate. Thrust attack like this
must take place very early in the launch or at each stage seperation.
You've probably got no more than 30-60 seconds out of a 30 minute flight
(for a ICBM that isn't sub launched, then you've got single/double stage
and about 15 minutes max).
While the current systems won't do it, it should even be possible with
high power short pulse width systems to heat the air in front of the
rocket to cause turbulence.

Even that's not sufficient since lasers have been demonstrated for
mid-course assaults as well.
All it really takes is to get it cocked a tad off senter and aerodynamic
forces will take it apart, irrespective of hull weakness.
They've certainly managed to kill enough of them in tests starting as far
back as the ASAT fighters from the 80's. The reality is that quite a lot
of research goes on in attacking the warheads while in the mid-course
phase. It's also worth mentioning that in general the individual (assuming
MRV) warheads don't usually seperate until after mid-flight. This means a
not-so-small target.
Actually not, if you strike the tanks (they are typically filled with
Nitrogen to both provide strength, ala a plastic coke bottle with the top
on and off, and to help move fuel to the engines. Approximately half the
flight occurs in this phase.
The satellite used was specifically chosen to mimic the characteristics of
a re-entry vehicle.
All I can say is google and 'anti-satellite aircraft'.

Maybe. But even mirrors can be burned through by a laser. And then we've
got weight issues that this would entail. It's not like they've got a lot
of overhead for the job. I suspect that faceting wouldn't be any more
effective than a smoothly round body form, it could have aerodynamic
effects as well (ie sharp corners at the facet edges - and yes they could
be rounded - now you're moving back toward a round rocket planform).

Does throwing a fire extenguisher at a auto window constitution probable
cause for lethal force in self-defence?
No. Because the fire extenguisher won't go through the safety glass.

Actually I've seen windows break (and broken my fair share) on cars
multiple times. Some from wrecks, some from gunshot (a .38 will bounce off
a windshield for example) some from other things. I even once had a D
based rocket fired directly into the windshield of a 68 Cougar, it was
much larger and going a hell of a lot faster than a fire exstinguisher.
It didn't go through the window. Didn't even break it.
A center puch (which focuses the force into a small area) isn't a fire
extstinguisher. And windows are DESIGNED to break into a thousand little
pieces, it absorbs the force of the impact. That way you don't get the
sorts of car accident results that were so common in the country up
through the 60's when the safety(!!!!) glass was put in all cars
(admittedly Genoa isn't in the US). Things like no heads, amputated arms,
chopped off noses and ears, etc.
You should dig up some of the old safety crash films from that time and
compare them to what happens today.
A fire extinguisher stuck in a window does none of the above.
I doubt seriously anyone would be blinded (and I'm blind in one eye from
being struck with a 2x4 so I can speak from 1st person, yes it's great
bodily injury. It's not justification for lethal force).

@_subject: A question of self-defence - Fire extinguishers & self defence 
Sorry, no backpedaling here (how are you liking your bike anyway?). I
stand behind my previous statements on this topic.
We're not talking about 'self-defence' here, we're talking 'deadly force'.
Not 1-to-1. Nice strawman though.
Couldn't pay me to be a lawyer. I do know what sort of law I want my
country to have and as a citizen I have a right and a responsibility to
express that and to act toward those ends. If that pisses you off (or
bruises your ego to the point of wanting to 'prove' how smart you are in
comparison), well so be it. I've really got better things to do with my
time than some silly elementary school bully schtick you're emotionally
attached to.
"I'm right because I made a 97'th percentile on my LSAT!"....yeah, right.
What experiment? You paying the bill? If you'll pay the bill and somebody
can identify the weight of the extinguisher and the model of the car I'd
be willing to locate one in a junkyard and throw a fire extinguisher
through it. I figure it would be worth a giggle or two (pretty low key
rush really). I have safety equipment and 5 acres to work on. From simple
low-velocity KE interactions the odds of being blinded are nil with
standard safety equipment (which is why I ended up blind in one eye,
don't have to tell me twice no siree bob). I'm regularly exposed to low to
medium velocity particulate flying through the air because of my hobbies
(ever seen a plate glass capacitor go when it's driving a .5MV Tesla
coil? Woo Woo!!!! Now there's 'deadly force'). I also get exposed to
deafness, flame, heat prostration, asphyxiation, poisoning, etc. on a
regular basis too. As well as drowning, falls from extreme heights (50 to
4,000+ feet), nitrogen narcosis, large autonomous robots and mechanicals,
etc. I used to do 'traditional' full contact TKD also (which raises
another point, if a 12 year old can succesfully block a 150+ lb. man in a
leap with an arm deflection a 15-20lb. fire extinguisher is nothing). I
get off on it.
One caveat, Ctl. Tx. is in our regular summer burn ban so no explosives or
You should go to srl.org and look at the Austin show ('96) for examples of
the sort of shit I like to play with. Or get in touch with one of the
Austin Robot Group and ask them about some of the stuff that we used to do
on a regular basis at Discovery Hall (they sponsored the SRL show). Don
would be a good one. If you can find anybody from DH that still works at
the Austin Childrens Museum (sponsored by Dell) they can tell you some
stories I'm sure.
Why the hell weren't those cops wearing eye protection with all that shit
flying around, it was the middle of a riot (I'll bet they had their body
armor on). Their stupidity should rest squarely on their shoulders. Why
was a vehicle without safety wire allowed anywhere near a known riot
location? Hell, putting your hand up would have nullified any 'great
bodily harm' potential (eg putting it on the inside of the glass where the
extinguisher struck). A broken arm or hand is not 'great bodily harm' by
any definition (except a self-serving one perhaps). Amateurs with no experience around those sorts of environments really should keep their
mouths shut about how that stuff works.
No, the cops panicked. The evidence isn't that they shot the protestor,
but rather that they drove over his body in their panic to 'escape'. They
lost their composure, they failed as police officers when it really,
really counted. I don't believe 'murder' is appropriate but 'manslaughter'
and being thrown off the force seem equitable.
And then there is the point that at no time is the police officer relieved
of their sworn duty to protect the citizens, including the rioters.
Self-defence is NOT a sufficient release (there is a term for this policy but it escapes me, I know where to find it though and I'll share it
This is a perfect example of why the standard police psych requirement of
'likes to be in charge' is a poor choice for police forces. The instant
one of them clearly isn't they have no clue what to do. They resort to the
one strategy they need to avoid at all costs - initiating violence. It's
like watching a squirrel when my dogs get 'em trapped...round and round she
goes until it's vittles time.
When you strap that badge on you volunteer to become cannon fodder, the
first line of defence (not offence). It is better a police officer gives
up their life to save another than to take a life to save their own, that
is where the true honor of the badge comes from, not the pistol but rather
the willingness NOT to use it. The gun is there for those rare cases when
it's necessary to use force to save anothers(!!!) life, not ones own. A
police officers primary responsiblity is not to save their own life but to
spend it to save another.

It looks like the G8 fire extinguisher was of the ~20lb variety. This is
the same weight class as the bags of dog food I buy for my dogs. Next time
you buy one get a friend to toss 'em back and forth.
Then ask yourself, does that mass represent a deadly threat?
The reality is that unless they snuck up behind you and hit you in the
head a single might break a bone or arm but would not in any way be life
If you've got access to skateboard wrist and elbow pads get a real fire
extinguisher and try to block it with your hand. It ain't that hard.

While it's true the hole would have reduced the cushion impact of breaking
the glass it would not have eliminated it.
NATO says it takes a transfer of approx. 85 Joules to kill.
Figure out the velocity that takes for 15 lbs.. Compare to the velocity
possible in this incidence.
In addition the fact that a previous protestor had put a board through the
window only goes to demonstrate the high level of emotional disruption
these officers were exposed to. Panicking is not justification for making
a wrong decision.
Deadly force was not in any way justified.

They didn't have safety glass in the 50's. Those sort of accidents that
got worse into the 60's are the reason they put safety glass in cars. Back
in those old days it was 'tempered' which means heat treated to be hard,
not shock resistant.

The optics used for focusing are NOT mirrors, they are (hopefully)
transparent at the frequency under use. A mirror on the other hand is
required to be OPAQUE with respect to transmission, we want full, 100%,
reflectivity. That means that every photon that hits that mirror
interacts, loses some energy, and gets re-emitted.

And these are reasonably low power lasers...
The simple fact is that the thermodynamic impact of a laser beam that is
several feet across and emitting more photons than the surface of the sun
will not be easy to reflect unless immense cooling is taken. Cost/weight
factors alone argue it in the negative.
Remember, that laser is hotter than the surface of the sun area for area.
You'll need cooling systems comparible to the aircraft carrying the laser
(consider the cooling of the main or final steering mirror alone in aircraft
weight). Even the finest mirrors will not stand up to that uncooled, and
even then not for long. Consider the expansive impact on the cryogenic fuel
components. How much are they over-rated?

The ones absorbed by the mirror are turned into low-frequency (ie heat)

effected, some small few will. As the beam intensity goes up so does the
total number of 'interactions' betwix the mirror atoms and the beam
photons going in and exciting them little babies. At some point they fall
in a variety of cascades (again statistically determinable at least) which
again convert that intially mono-tonic photon into a variety of poly-tonic

Here is what actually happens. It's called "The Radiated Electric Field".
Some 1st year engineering physics books will have it listed in the index
under 'mirror'.
The incident photons strike the mirror.
A current is induced.
That current is electrons moving in a resistor. Making heat, losing
energy. Note, we are NOT talking about photons here but J/C.
That current re-emits photons that retain both frequency and temporal/time
related coherence (see Maxwell's Equations for more detail). However, the
total number of photons MUST be reduced from the incident beam. This also
means the incident photons can not be the same as the emitted photons.
The photons (as opposed to 'a photon') lose energy.
Blipverts strike again!

In numbers,
z_o is the area of the incident beam
j_o is the surface current per unit distance
I_o is the induced current
I_o = (z_o)(j_o)
j_o = (c * E_o)/(2 * 3.14159... * k_o)
Go look those up yourself.

Really? I'd say that any distinction between the 'photons energy' and the
'current energy' is a false distinction. The 'current' is realy a
'virtual' current since it exists 'instantaniously' (ie there is no
discernable delay between the incident photons and the emitted one)
otherwise your 'mirror' wouldn't be a 'mirror' (ie the reflected image
would not retain both phase and time coherence) as the reflected waves
would be in-coherent. For a similar 'virtual' effect look at the current
flow on the input of a op-amp (ie virtual ground).
In either case, your distinction is irrelevant to the issue at hand.
Will a mirror, even the most effective mirror on the planet, work as a
defence against a high-level optical laser for a rocket (ie ICBM)?
Answer, no. Even the small losses of such a perfect mirror at these beam
intensities would be too great. There are three components to this
failure. The first is the simple losses in the mirror itself, the second
is the massive cooling it would require to compensate for these loses
would completely destroy the ability of the rocket to deliver its warhead,
and then some since it would be roughly equivalent to another rocket being
strapped onto this one. The impact on Isp is catastrophic in this
scenario. Then we can look at operational issues, will it even fit in a
submarine now effectively? Will it fit on a mobile launcher? I doubt it
considering the size changes that would need to take place. And thirdly, even if we allow that the mirroring worked, it is a moot point. The
rocket is now too large and slow to deliver its warheads effectively
because the increase in mass has so reduced its range and payload. By
defeating the laser, you've created a missile that you can't launch.
The goal of the laser operator is obtained, in either case.

FBI Cyber Researcher Unleashes Virus
That E-Mails Private Agency Documents
By TED BRIDIS
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
WASHINGTON -- A researcher in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
cyber-protection unit unleashed a fast-spreading Internet virus that
e-mailed private FBI documents to outsiders -- all on the eve of a Senate
hearing into troubles at the unit.
Although the Sircam virus didn't spread to other computers at the FBI's
National Infrastructure Protection Center, it did send at least eight
documents to a number of outsiders. One, about the investigation into an
unrelated virus, was marked "official use only." The Sircam virus has
infected thousands of computers since its discovery last week.
1U.S. Pentagon Shuts Down Public Access to Web Sites (July 24)
2'Code Red' Web Virus May Attack Other Computers in Coming Weeks (July 23)
FBI spokeswoman Deb Weierman said that no sensitive or classified
information about continuing investigations was disclosed Tuesday. The
"official use" designation protects documents from disclosure under the
U.S. Freedom of Information Act.
It isn't uncommon for virus researchers to accidentally infect their own
computers, but the mistake was particularly embarrassing because it
occurred ahead of a Senate Judiciary panel's oversight hearing about the
FBI cyber unit's effectiveness. Lawmakers were expected to focus on other
agencies' failure to cooperate fully with the FBI center, and on a
perceived lack of trust between the FBI and private-sector groups.
The unit generally gets high remarks for its criminal investigations, and
even critics say the unit is more effective than it was a year ago. "The
effort here is not to embarrass anybody but to stress that a lot of work
has to be done," said Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona.
Meanwhile, the White House has begun organizing a new early-warning network
for Internet threats. But unlike the current system, it will be coordinated
by the Pentagon, not the FBI. The mechanism for warning all U.S. military
and civilian agencies -- and ultimately corporations -- will be dubbed the
Cyber-Warning and Information Network, or "c-win." Organizers envision
dozens of computer centers that could sound an alert when a threat is
The network is expected to begin operating in October. The FBI unit, which
currently relays these warnings, came under sharp criticism from
congressional auditors for issuing tardy alerts. Ms. Weierman, the FBI
spokeswoman, called the new network a "useful mechanism" to offer the
government a "technical capability that doesn't currently exist." The FBI,
she said, wasn't concerned it would lose its warning responsibilities.
Tuesday, at least three people said they received some of the FBI
documents, including a 23-year-old Internet-security expert in Belgium,
Niels Heinen. He operates a Web site that reports on Internet break-ins and
speculated that the analyst, Vince Rowe, visited the site on the infected
computer. Mr. Rowe didn't respond to a request for comment.

@_subject: Salon: The real enemies of the poor 
But read any one of them at random Maybe, I read a shitload of 'books of articles' from this government
agency or that contractor on a variety of issues. Most of them don't
change except on a scale measured in decades. But at the same time I added
it to my list because there were several subjects on there I'm very
interested in (always good to throw more wood on the fire ;).
What I found amusing is that you read the Salon article (probably w/o
great enthusiasm considering it is Salon after all) and you had another
text of articles you hadn't read but had already decided it was a worthy
read and that you'd get something out of it. Especially since it was such 'weighty' material in two different contexts.
I've got a math book I'm wading through that's like that. It's about 40
articles and I've been reading it for about a year now. I don't intend to repeat Tesla's mistake.
He typically would read all books by an author in one sequence, and read
nothing else. He considered it a measure of his discipline. He received a
book by Virgil and found it likable. So he proceeded to order a complete
set of works. Only to discover that it was over a 100 books. Needless to
say he wasn't amused. He bought them, read them, and then swore to never
read another book again without first finding out how many books the
author had written.
Probably not any more popular a viewpoint now than a tad over a hundred
years ago.
I strongly want global trade and cultural exchange. I do not want global
government or corporate enterprise. I want direct interaction of business
in government to be prohibited.
The real enemy of all is death.
Halt Passenger!
As you are now, so once was I
As I am now, so shall you be
Prepare for death, and follow me!

CRYPTO SURVEY MAY 2001

******************************************************** A SUMMARY CONCLUSION: The major societal development since the 1st and 2nd crypto surveys in 1996 and 1997 has been the removal of many regulatory barriers for open trading of cryptographic products in the North America and globally. In addition, the number of cryptographic applications and component implementations has increased, while at the same time the variety of different types of solutions has risen. This does not necessarily mean the wider use of encryption in businesses and personal activities. Many same or similar behavioral barriers for the effective utilization of many security solutions still exist limiting the protection of communications, data storage and networking. In addition, the lack of the interoperability between solutions from different suppliers tends to decrease the number of effective cryptography users worldwide. It is clear that the awareness for encrypted communication and protected information activities has increased, while necessary regulatory changes for protectin!
g !
entities from security vulnerabilities has enabled cryptographic product suppliers to satisfy market requirements in the U.S.A., in the North America and globally. However, regulatory and cultural differences exist from one nation or region to another creating a global unbalanced situation of the security use, which has the reducing effect on security practices and policy implementations of any global entity in different regions. This impacts on the interoperability of units of global entities. It is likely that there shall be greater competing drives in the information technology market place between different security strategies and approaches from different software and hardware product and security suppliers.
QUESTION 1. In your opinion, what are the 5-10 most significant applications of encryption technologies currently in commercial enterprises? 1. HTTP over SSL (aka HTTPS) / SSL for credit card processing / SSL / Web-activity privacy (SSL)
2. IPsec
3. RSA Secure ID (maybe)        4. Online Credit Card Processing & Financial Transfers
5. VPNs / Virtual Private Networks for widely distributed offices / VPN for remote access to Intranet
6. Email encryption (via PGP/GPG or SMIME) / Encrypted Messages / Email Privacy
7. Digital signing authentication of messages
8. Consensus and voting software (not now but give it 5 years)
9. Encrypted file systems for sensitive data
10. Signing software for installation
11. Signing email messages to show official authority
12. Wireless local area network encryption
13. Password protection/access control
14. Data protection
15. Session protection (VPN's)
16. Authentication and authorization / Customer authentication (e.g. PIN checking)
17. Securing B2B file exchange
18. PKI
19. Remote secure teleworking
20. Digital signatures
21. Time-stamping
QUESTION 2. In your opinion, what are 5-10 main barriers currently that may prevent the successful implementation and utilization of encryption technologies in commercial enterprises? 1. Ignorance of risks prevents purchase
2. Dishonest portrayal of product (i.e.: false security claims and blatant product holes in end-to-end protection) promotes distrust in the whole
3. Most products are a waste of time because they are not a comprehensive solution - e.g.: why bother using PGP when there is nothing in any NAI products to protect against back-office-style electronic eavesdropping attacks?
4. Many people do not care about cryptography and/or security products
5. Having lived happily without serious protection for a long while, most customers believe there is no point retrofitting an expensive solution for a problem they do not have (and many of them are probably right...)
6. Lack of knowledge by decision-maker
7. Low knowledge level of users
8. Lack of knowledge by computer scientists
9. Lack of complete standards (S/MIME to be extended, ...)
10. Cost
11. It is too hard to use / complexity / Not transparent enough and made user hard to use.
12. Difficult and complex configurations.
13. Diversity of enterprise
14. Trained security personnel
15. Commercial operating systems are too difficult to secure and hence there is no such thing as a rusted base
16. No widely accepted standard for smart cards or tokens
17. No facility for reading smart cards or tokens on mass market PCs
18. Character limit on Microsoft passwords
19. Bad advice on password generation
20. Unjustified prices for non-commodity products
21. Confused security market - lack of standards and best practices, everyone is trying to define their own market segment and different way to solve the same common problem.
22. Protectiveness of public sector - local solutions are preferred
23. No. 1 is the need of users training, as they tend not to understand too well what procedures are for encryption.  This can mean huge resources/budgeting requirements and the aftermath of running Helpdesk support.  24. Key distribution is also a major consideration for large user groups.  PKI seems to address this problem but it brings forth more problems of its own.  PKI is not simple to set up in a production environment and certificates rollout is a noted issue.  Incompatibility issues with various PKI vendors' product may bring down the whole PKI project.  Very often customers are forced into accepting single PKI supplier solution.  PKI related standards abound but incompatibility is still with us.  Also an issue is the insufficient supply of security professional to serve customers' demand. 25. Lack of PKI or alternative
26. Expensive charges by digital certificate issuers
27. Difficulty of users managing passwords
28. Failures of interoperability between vendors implementing "standards"
29. IS department sees encryption as a limit on its monitoring activities
30. Users lack of security knowledge
31. Interoperability between heterogeneous systems
32. Not aware of the importance of security
33. Complex key management 34. Inefficiency
35. Most existing Public Key infrastructures are based on deeply flawed models of trust.  They abandon the idea of trust and aim to prove identity instead - but fail to do even that since Verisign, etc, do not adequately protect themselves from fraud.
36. There are too few key authorities and the business has substantial barriers to entry.  Basically, if you cannot get your root key into the default configuration of the majority browser (for which the software company that makes the majority browser will charge a very large amount of money) then your key authority is a non-starter. This creates a monopoly environment in which customers are being drastically overcharged and underserved for their key certificates, and also creates targets for hacking, fraud, or legal compromise, which would cause enormous damage if compromised.
37. The non-centralized key authorities favored by PGP et al are a better trust model and don't suffer from the few-points-of-attack problem, but they are being killed by apathy.  The "web of trust" is no longer a web, it's a bunch of teeny bits of webbing blowing hither and yon. 38. Software Patents.  Software patents have necessitated creating multiple incompatible versions of many things that ought to be public infrastructure and utilities by now.  As long as users of one version of PGP can't read or verify messages created by another, due to software patents, all versions of PGP have diminished utility.
39. Development practices.  It is almost impossible to write secure code using what is now considered "ordinary" Object-oriented programming.  GUI's and windowing systems have so many deep security flaws that security is nearly impossible unless these things are reimplemented from the ground up.  In particular, every windowing system on the market makes it possible to monitor keystrokes intended for a different program, and none even have an option to "clear" memory of what's on the screen before releasing the memory back to the system where another program can allocate it.
40. Protocol Impoverishment.  There are many useful protocols that have been discussed and discovered, but very *VERY* few of them have ever seen a robust or publicly available implementation.
QUESTION 3. What are activities and projects that can be initiated and taken to lower and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)? 1. Introduce a new government law which makes security companies 100% liable and responsible for all damage and losses that occur as a result of their software failing to perform the purpose it was sold for, and failing to live up to their advertised claims. This will force product vendors to revise their claims, remove the lies from their packaging, and cause them to have to print lengthy explanations of what threats their products can not withstand.  This will give customers an opportunity to understand what risks they really face after using various products and an opportunity to seriously compare different products pre-purchase.
2. Education and training
3. Consulting or outsourcing of enterprise security
4. More publicity
5. Standardization
6. Integration of security products into mass-market software
7. There is little we can do about the end-users, I think time is the best cure here.  Imagine asking the government or any organization to provide free training on security practices to all.  Hopefully, users will see encryption is a tool to protect them and help them rather than something hindering their work and therefore must fight against.  On the (encryption) technology side I believe the industry can do something to help the poor users and itself as a side bonus.  It would be much easier for security integrators if different vendors work together making their solutions friendlier to each other.  I notice this trend has started already but I think it is not enough.  There should be some form of non-vendor affiliated body that run some certification scheme to endorse/state "what product from which vendor is compatible with who" sort of reference.
8. Remove the barriers listed in Question 2
9. Develop an alternate Internet based on secure technology.
10. Education project to be launched in include cryptography in engineering and computer scientist basic school programs.
11. A widely accepted, free certificate issuer would solve the PKI and certificate-expense problems.  This could be a government service.
12. Simplification of security standards and focusing on profiles, which represent limited but functional subsets will help with interop.
13. Most security standards are too complex.
14. Children should begin being trained in school to deal with network security throughout their lives.  They should learn to memorize passwords and understand the basic functionality of two key cryptography. 15. Schools should prepare children for a life where crypto keys are tools they are as comfortable using as computers.
16. Push a practical PKI for ease of use.
17. Make interface more friendly and transparent to the users.
18. Reduce human interactions.
19. Make configuration easy.
20. Public domain or public-license sw for an extended set of protocols ought to be developed.  Software patents have become a "poison pill" to compatibility, so they ought to be avoided and it ought to be possible to completely avoid them.  GPG and OpenSSH are the two premier examples of this, and their existence has a lot to do with the technologies they represent having finally become important.
21. Public awareness of the probability and consequences of failure to keep data secure.  This is sorely lacking now, although the IT departments of major companies are finally starting to "get it". 22. Public Key authorities need to be much easier to set up. 23. Crypto books aimed at kids and amateurs.  The developers stuff is there already, but it's hard to draw new workers into the field beyond the stale "spy glamour" thing.  Anyway, kids and amateurs are the future security pros who can solve the major problems with software and etc; we just need more people in the field who are willing to get their hands dirty and experiment with code. This is one of the most lopsided fields of software development, where we have *SCADS* of ideas from academics that no one has had time to properly implement yet.  We need a lot of implementers to get really fired up about it.
CRYPTO SURVEYS OF 1996 AND 1997  SURVEY SUMMARY : ENCRYPTION FOLLOW-UP SURVEY
   MAY, 1997
Note: This survey summary contains raw survey results that have NOT been
analyzed, evaluated or prioritized. The results are based on comments
and opinions (all of which may not be facts) that were received from
many individuals who responded to the original (October 1996) survey.
QUESTION 1: In your opinion, what are main developments in the adoption
of encryption technologies in commercial enterprises since October,
"The continued government attempts to get 'key recovery', and a certain
amount of reluctant willingness from business."
"Purely for e-commerce reasons have there been any advancements. The
rest of the encryption world (privacy/freedom etc.) have been
appallingly backward and most governments will tend to hold them back."
"Network Computers (NCs)."
"Slight easing of export restrictions. Development of several payment
protocols. Increasing adoption of retail commerce over the net as
evidenced by recent IPO of Amazon.com."
"There is some movement towards more advanced mathematics.  The market
is searching for patent free/royalty free encryption.   Governments are
attempting to halt it, but are failing miserably."
"Electronic payment via The Internet."
"C2's bypass of the export regulations. The broader adoption of SSL.
Eudora plugins for PGP."
"-SSL has been widely used for the securing of data for a number of
on-line Internet banks.   -Encrypted tunneling products which extend the
corporate Intranet/LAN are now becoming widely available. -Smart cards
are finally appearing in North America.  In Canada alone Visa Cash,
Exact (Proton?), and Mondex are going through trials. -SSL is now widely
used to protect credit card transactions on a number  of internet retail
sites -The US government continues to support key escrow for exported
encryption.  -Major players (i.e. banks, IBM, MS, HP, VeriFone) are
taking steps to integrate  SET into their range of products. -Future
browsers are going to allow smart cards to Interface with the Internet."
QUESTION 2: In your opinion, what are 5-10  main barriers currently that
may prevent the successful implementation and utilization of encryption
technologies in commercial enterprises?
"-Legislation and government intervention for strong encryption.
-Unfamiliarity with the technology will produce mistrust of its
reliability. -Safe key-management processes are difficult to achieve.
This will  reduce the security of cryptography and thus its usefulness
for many  applications. -Cryptography is not user-friendly right now.
Until it becomes so  than it is unlikely to achieve widespread usage.
-Licensing fees for cryptographic algorithms are not cheap.  Until
patents expire for things like the RSA public key algorithm the  costs
of developing reliable cryptographic products will remain high. - There
are a large number of cryptographic products with no clear standards in
"Export regulations."
"Lack of perceived need."
"Lack of expertise among engineers and technicians."
"a) Lack of interest in security b) Concentration on cost c) Lack of
ready-to-use cheap tools d) Legislation and potential legislation e)
Patents and licensing issues"
"Government inadequacies in legislation, Vendors propensity to hand
private keys to government (extrapolate that to insecurity when a person
working for a vendor is bribed to give out a private key), Costs, Public
reluctance in encryption (FUD factor)"
"Threats to roles of traditional players (e.g., SET's effect on card
issuers)., Seamless integration into products., Education of users.,
Regulatory obstacles. Widespread availability."
"1) ease of use, 2) cost of real security, 3) an understanding of
security details, 4) a lack of understanding the difference between
cryptography and security 5) uncertainty as to what the government rules
"- exportability (permissions are needed if a product implements
cryptography, and 2 or more versions of the software has to be build), -
patents (can't exploit algorithms without negotiating royalties)"
"The governments export restrictions on strong cryptographic
" It is not a question of availability of software, but of
interoperability between systems made/sold in different regions of the
"Government FUD. Ease of use. Cost of training etc. Worry about leakage
of secrets."
QUESTION 3: What are activities and projects that can be initiated and
taken to lower and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)?
"a)     Wider accurate  publication of security lapses.
  b),c)  Cheap tools fitted for a job.  I just read a Sun catalogue
       where much of the software (including security software)
       has laughable prices.   Get a straightforward Virtual
       Private Network from 100 pounds for a start.
d)     Do strong lobbying and occupy lawmaker's time with other stuff
       when they seem to be going in the wrong direction.
e)     Wait for some important expiry dates.
       Have more reasonable contact with license-holders.
       Bypass licenses by producing new methods that get less
       restriction."
"Continued integration into key products such as Netscape and IE.
Perhaps even into OSes."
"Lowering the barriers to deploying certification authority
infrastructures for use w/in intranets.  (in terms of cost, ease of
administration, etc.), Further efforts at deregulation."
"Lobby governments, Do not place restrictions for vendor based key
management, Push for totally private key systems"
"A not for profit, global, public education group should be created
whose purpose is to help educate businesses.  Secondarily it should
educate the public on the issues of privacy, but the primary goal should
be to get all businesses (mainly the small ones) to understand that
simple pains can give a great deal of security, and that the cost is
worth the money and time saved from fraud and theft."
"An e-mail program that a "stoned hippy" could use and still not leak
information is needed.  It would not allow too much flexibility, but it
would give "the masses" a hands on feel for what security is and how
crypto plays a role in their everyday life.  Six year old kids and their
grandmothers could be using even this simple security level for e-mail.
It would go a long way because people will ask many questions, and they
will get many answers.  It would more rapidly diffuse the information
and education over the populace (world wide)."
"Develop simple and user-friendly ways to use cryptography and manage
keys effectively."
"Reduce the ability for corporations to patent cryptographic processes,
key-management techniques, and anything other than completely unique
cryptographic algorithms.  We don't need research into new cryptography
we need open access to refinements of what exists.  If people can
patent  those refinements then it reduces the access people have to
these new technologies at the expense of society at large."
"Eliminate export barriers on strong encryption."
"Education (public): crypto is used for authentication as well as
privacy.  It is *not* military or espionage technology.  It is
(required) enabling technology for tomorrow's information superhighway."
"Education (professional): principles of information security taught in
all relevant courses.  (e.g. computing, telecom, electronics, etc)."

        SURVEY SUMMARY:  Encryption in Commercial Enterprises
                                        October, 1996
                                                by
                                  M. J. Saarelainen
SURVEY METHODS BRIEFLY: Three specific questions were sent to several
mailing lists and news groups. The great number of responses was
received. These responses were compiled as received to the list (without
any priorities) below. No detailed analysis or evaluations were
completed at this time. Please, review these questions and responses and
let me know, if you like to add, remove or change something. Thanks.

21. Large investment banks who want to coordinate across their own
organizations and others in significant numbers
22. Healthcare cries out for encryption
23. The military for sensitive non-classified information.
24. Law enforcement is a natural for the internet, if they could agree
on a common security solution.
25. Online banking, online sales and commerce, data protection on
commercial database servers, secure transfer of govt. information, ie.
tax information on citizens.
26. The most widely spread encryption technologies are pgp and
proprietary hardware solutions by different providers like Cylink etc.
SSL is now upcoming.
27. Protection and storage of Archives
28. Person to person communication within an organization.
29. Secure remote communications (over the Internet)
QUESTION 2. In your opinion, what are 5-10  main barriers currently that
may prevent the successful implementation and utilization of encryption
technologies in commercial enterprises?
RESPONSES (# of responses = 22)  TO QUESTION 2:
1. Cryptic user interfaces
2. ITAR regulations, Government regulation or restrictions of use of
strong encryption, Government export restrictions for strong encryption.
3. Ignorance ( pegasus provides REAL encryption )
4. Lack of knowledge of resources available to Business.
5. Misunderstanding that encryption is complicated.
6. Misunderstanding that encryption is costly.
7. General lack of knowledge as to how to write *strong* encryption
8. Lack of integration of strong encryption so that the user must
learn/know too much in order to use it properly
9. General lack of understanding of the necessity of *strong* encryption
10. Difficult to use
11. Slow speed
12. Complexity makes choices difficult since no one can be a full expert
13. Workers have to wait for a supervisor
14. A lack of understanding of the technology
15. The lack of good cost-benefit analysis data
16. On the product development side, few companies have both the
engineering and the marketing/industry expertise to successfully make
good secure products which meet real market needs and demands
17. Key Management. The ability for a user to gain authentification for
use of cryptographic programs, to access information for which that
person is authorized. Passwords can be forgotten, or copied, verifying a
user easily is very difficult.
18. Lack of standards, and most of all lack of good certification
19. The second barrier derives from a missing standard interface in
E-Mail, ftp ...  solutions.so transparently embed widely spread
20. Lack of knowledge of encryption is a big hurdle to it's
implementation.  Non-technical people are required to evaluate the use
of a technological product they may not understand completely.  It's
difficult to put your trust in an algorithm when you don't understand
how it works.
21. Many enterprises may not be aware of how easy it is to begin using
encryption within their organization.
22. Many organizations may not recognize the need to protect information
within their organization.  Some may not be aware of how easy it is to
tap into electronic communications.
QUESTION 3. What are activities and projects that can be initiated and
taken to lower and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)?
RESPONSES (# of responses = 27) TO QUESTION 3:
1. Integrated mail reader with PGP capabilities, easy to use
2. Spreading awareness of how useful strong crypto really is.
3. Spreading awareness of exactly *why* governments seeks to prevent the
spread of crypto.
4. Writing strong encryption software and placing it in the public
5. Proving by actual demonstration that existing encryption is
6. Encouraging wealthy crypto advocates to speak freely.
7. Education of users and vendors of the issues
8. Lobbying of governments by aforementioned enlightened users/vendors
9. Different products need to be created which can interoperate
transparently to the user, but not deliver data unless operator is valid
10. Smart cards which attach to every terminal, the cards go with the
person and they can validate themselves at any terminal
11. Overcoming the complexity barrier requires patient teaching of each
12. A set of brochures and pamphlets needs to be created which describes
most systems in use for a particular level of security
13. A major project would be to simply educate the managers of most
companies about crypto, to remove the magic and bring the whole thing
down to earth
14. Manufacturers need to go to more trouble talking with customers
before designing products and be more creative in finding ways to meet
market needs
15. Security companies also need to audit themselves and demonstrate
that they are trustworthy
16. Better turnkey low-cost enterprise-wide solutions to common problems
(network encryption, for example) are needed.
17. Make applications easier to use, Build easy to use encryption into
applications so that it is smooth or even transparent to users
18. Universal standards for dual key encryption
19. Reduce strength of encryption to increase speed
20. Large groups of customers must get together and dictate standards to
the security industry.
21. The first thing is to implement a transparent interface to
encryption function to all data transfer services.
22. The second would  be to get all suppliers of encryption technologies
to confirm to this standard.
23. I think the best  thing is to initiate a workgroup at The Open Group
responsible for encryption interfaces.
24. Public Software such as PGP should be widely available.  The more
people are experienced with this software the more likely they are to
use and trust it.
25. Making software like PGP widely available means more than just
making sure copies of it are accessible. It also means making it
user-friendly enough.
26. Education is also required.  I find that very few people really know
about these  issues.
27. People need to promote awareness of the current situation.

#    #    Court Rules Against Heat-Sensor Searches
#    #    Filed at 11:03 a.m. ET
#    #    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police violate the Constitution if they use #    a heat-sensing device to peer inside a home without a search #    warrant, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
#    #    An unusual lineup of five justices voted to bolster the Fourth #    Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and threw #    out an Oregon man's conviction for growing marijuana.
#    #    Monday's ruling reversed a lower court decision that said #    officers' use of a heat-sensing device was not a search of Danny #    Lee Kyllo's home and therefore they did not need a search warrant.
#    #    In an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, by many measures #    the most conservative member of the court, the majority found #    that the heat detector allowed police to see things they otherwise #    could not.
#    #    ``Where, as here, the government uses a device that is not in #    general public use to explore details of the home that would #    previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the #    surveillance is a 'search' and is presumptively unreasonable #    without a warrant,'' Scalia wrote.
#    #    While the court has previously approved some warrantless searches, #    this one did not meet tests the court has previously set, Scalia #    wrote.
#    #    The decision means the information police gathered with the #    thermal device -- namely a suspicious pattern of hot spots on #    the home's exterior walls -- cannot be used against Kyllo.
#    #    The court sent the case back to lower courts to determine whether #    police have enough other basis to support the search warrant #    that was eventually served on Kyllo, and thus whether any of #    the evidence inside his home can be used against him.
#    #    Justices Clarence Thomas, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg #    and Stephen Breyer joined the majority.
#    #    Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion joined by #    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Sandra Day #    O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.

CRYPTO SURVEY MAY 2001
Cryptographic Survey, May 2001, Markku J. Saarelainen
Email: cryptocom at hotvoice.com
******************************************************** A SUMMARY CONCLUSION: The major societal development since the 1st and 2nd crypto surveys in 1996 and 1997 has been the removal of many regulatory barriers for open trading of cryptographic products in the North America and globally. In addition, the number of cryptographic applications and component implementations has increased, while at the same time the variety of different types of solutions has risen. This does not necessarily mean the wider use of encryption in businesses and personal activities. Many same or similar behavioral barriers for the effective utilization of many security solutions still exist limiting the protection of communications, data storage and networking. In addition, the lack of the interoperability between solutions from different suppliers tends to decrease the number of effective cryptography users worldwide. It is clear that the awareness for encrypted communication and protected information activities has increased, while necessary regulatory changes for protectin!
g !
entities from security vulnerabilities has enabled cryptographic product suppliers to satisfy market requirements in the U.S.A., in the North America and globally. However, regulatory and cultural differences exist from one nation or region to another creating a global unbalanced situation of the security use, which has the reducing effect on security practices and policy implementations of any global entity in different regions. This impacts on the interoperability of units of global entities. It is likely that there shall be greater competing drives in the information technology market place between different security strategies and approaches from different software and hardware product and security suppliers.
QUESTION 1. In your opinion, what are the 5-10 most significant applications of encryption technologies currently in commercial enterprises? 1. HTTP over SSL (aka HTTPS) / SSL for credit card processing / SSL / Web-activity privacy (SSL)
2. IPsec
3. RSA Secure ID (maybe)        4. Online Credit Card Processing & Financial Transfers
5. VPNs / Virtual Private Networks for widely distributed offices / VPN for remote access to Intranet
6. Email encryption (via PGP/GPG or SMIME) / Encrypted Messages / Email Privacy
7. Digital signing authentication of messages
8. Consensus and voting software (not now but give it 5 years)
9. Encrypted file systems for sensitive data
10. Signing software for installation
11. Signing email messages to show official authority
12. Wireless local area network encryption
13. Password protection/access control
14. Data protection
15. Session protection (VPN's)
16. Authentication and authorization / Customer authentication (e.g. PIN checking)
17. Securing B2B file exchange
18. PKI
19. Remote secure teleworking
20. Digital signatures
21. Time-stamping
QUESTION 2. In your opinion, what are 5-10 main barriers currently that may prevent the successful implementation and utilization of encryption technologies in commercial enterprises? 1. Ignorance of risks prevents purchase
2. Dishonest portrayal of product (i.e.: false security claims and blatant product holes in end-to-end protection) promotes distrust in the whole
3. Most products are a waste of time because they are not a comprehensive solution - e.g.: why bother using PGP when there is nothing in any NAI products to protect against back-office-style electronic eavesdropping attacks?
4. Many people do not care about cryptography and/or security products
5. Having lived happily without serious protection for a long while, most customers believe there is no point retrofitting an expensive solution for a problem they do not have (and many of them are probably right...)
6. Lack of knowledge by decision-maker
7. Low knowledge level of users
8. Lack of knowledge by computer scientists
9. Lack of complete standards (S/MIME to be extended, ...)
10. Cost
11. It is too hard to use / complexity / Not transparent enough and made user hard to use.
12. Difficult and complex configurations.
13. Diversity of enterprise
14. Trained security personnel
15. Commercial operating systems are too difficult to secure and hence there is no such thing as a rusted base
16. No widely accepted standard for smart cards or tokens
17. No facility for reading smart cards or tokens on mass market PCs
18. Character limit on Microsoft passwords
19. Bad advice on password generation
20. Unjustified prices for non-commodity products
21. Confused security market - lack of standards and best practices, everyone is trying to define their own market segment and different way to solve the same common problem.
22. Protectiveness of public sector - local solutions are preferred
23. No. 1 is the need of users training, as they tend not to understand too well what procedures are for encryption.  This can mean huge resources/budgeting requirements and the aftermath of running Helpdesk support.  24. Key distribution is also a major consideration for large user groups.  PKI seems to address this problem but it brings forth more problems of its own.  PKI is not simple to set up in a production environment and certificates rollout is a noted issue.  Incompatibility issues with various PKI vendors' product may bring down the whole PKI project.  Very often customers are forced into accepting single PKI supplier solution.  PKI related standards abound but incompatibility is still with us.  Also an issue is the insufficient supply of security professional to serve customers' demand. 25. Lack of PKI or alternative
26. Expensive charges by digital certificate issuers
27. Difficulty of users managing passwords
28. Failures of interoperability between vendors implementing "standards"
29. IS department sees encryption as a limit on its monitoring activities
30. Users lack of security knowledge
31. Interoperability between heterogeneous systems
32. Not aware of the importance of security
33. Complex key management 34. Inefficiency
35. Most existing Public Key infrastructures are based on deeply flawed models of trust.  They abandon the idea of trust and aim to prove identity instead - but fail to do even that since Verisign, etc, do not adequately protect themselves from fraud.
36. There are too few key authorities and the business has substantial barriers to entry.  Basically, if you cannot get your root key into the default configuration of the majority browser (for which the software company that makes the majority browser will charge a very large amount of money) then your key authority is a non-starter. This creates a monopoly environment in which customers are being drastically overcharged and underserved for their key certificates, and also creates targets for hacking, fraud, or legal compromise, which would cause enormous damage if compromised.
37. The non-centralized key authorities favored by PGP et al are a better trust model and don't suffer from the few-points-of-attack problem, but they are being killed by apathy.  The "web of trust" is no longer a web, it's a bunch of teeny bits of webbing blowing hither and yon. 38. Software Patents.  Software patents have necessitated creating multiple incompatible versions of many things that ought to be public infrastructure and utilities by now.  As long as users of one version of PGP can't read or verify messages created by another, due to software patents, all versions of PGP have diminished utility.
39. Development practices.  It is almost impossible to write secure code using what is now considered "ordinary" Object-oriented programming.  GUI's and windowing systems have so many deep security flaws that security is nearly impossible unless these things are reimplemented from the ground up.  In particular, every windowing system on the market makes it possible to monitor keystrokes intended for a different program, and none even have an option to "clear" memory of what's on the screen before releasing the memory back to the system where another program can allocate it.
40. Protocol Impoverishment.  There are many useful protocols that have been discussed and discovered, but very *VERY* few of them have ever seen a robust or publicly available implementation.
QUESTION 3. What are activities and projects that can be initiated and taken to lower and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)? 1. Introduce a new government law which makes security companies 100% liable and responsible for all damage and losses that occur as a result of their software failing to perform the purpose it was sold for, and failing to live up to their advertised claims. This will force product vendors to revise their claims, remove the lies from their packaging, and cause them to have to print lengthy explanations of what threats their products can not withstand.  This will give customers an opportunity to understand what risks they really face after using various products and an opportunity to seriously compare different products pre-purchase.
2. Education and training
3. Consulting or outsourcing of enterprise security
4. More publicity
5. Standardization
6. Integration of security products into mass-market software
7. There is little we can do about the end-users, I think time is the best cure here.  Imagine asking the government or any organization to provide free training on security practices to all.  Hopefully, users will see encryption is a tool to protect them and help them rather than something hindering their work and therefore must fight against.  On the (encryption) technology side I believe the industry can do something to help the poor users and itself as a side bonus.  It would be much easier for security integrators if different vendors work together making their solutions friendlier to each other.  I notice this trend has started already but I think it is not enough.  There should be some form of non-vendor affiliated body that run some certification scheme to endorse/state "what product from which vendor is compatible with who" sort of reference.
8. Remove the barriers listed in Question 2
9. Develop an alternate Internet based on secure technology.
10. Education project to be launched in include cryptography in engineering and computer scientist basic school programs.
11. A widely accepted, free certificate issuer would solve the PKI and certificate-expense problems.  This could be a government service.
12. Simplification of security standards and focusing on profiles, which represent limited but functional subsets will help with interop.
13. Most security standards are too complex.
14. Children should begin being trained in school to deal with network security throughout their lives.  They should learn to memorize passwords and understand the basic functionality of two key cryptography. 15. Schools should prepare children for a life where crypto keys are tools they are as comfortable using as computers.
16. Push a practical PKI for ease of use.
17. Make interface more friendly and transparent to the users.
18. Reduce human interactions.
19. Make configuration easy.
20. Public domain or public-license sw for an extended set of protocols ought to be developed.  Software patents have become a "poison pill" to compatibility, so they ought to be avoided and it ought to be possible to completely avoid them.  GPG and OpenSSH are the two premier examples of this, and their existence has a lot to do with the technologies they represent having finally become important.
21. Public awareness of the probability and consequences of failure to keep data secure.  This is sorely lacking now, although the IT departments of major companies are finally starting to "get it". 22. Public Key authorities need to be much easier to set up. 23. Crypto books aimed at kids and amateurs.  The developers stuff is there already, but it's hard to draw new workers into the field beyond the stale "spy glamour" thing.  Anyway, kids and amateurs are the future security pros who can solve the major problems with software and etc; we just need more people in the field who are willing to get their hands dirty and experiment with code. This is one of the most lopsided fields of software development, where we have *SCADS* of ideas from academics that no one has had time to properly implement yet.  We need a lot of implementers to get really fired up about it.

many individuals who responded to the original (October 1996) survey.
QUESTION 1: In your opinion, what are main developments in the adoption
of encryption technologies in commercial enterprises since October,
"The continued government attempts to get 'key recovery', and a certain
amount of reluctant willingness from business."
"Purely for e-commerce reasons have there been any advancements. The
rest of the encryption world (privacy/freedom etc.) have been
appallingly backward and most governments will tend to hold them back."
"Network Computers (NCs)."
"Slight easing of export restrictions. Development of several payment
protocols. Increasing adoption of retail commerce over the net as
evidenced by recent IPO of Amazon.com."
"There is some movement towards more advanced mathematics.  The market
is searching for patent free/royalty free encryption.   Governments are
attempting to halt it, but are failing miserably."
"Electronic payment via The Internet."
"C2's bypass of the export regulations. The broader adoption of SSL.
Eudora plugins for PGP."
"-SSL has been widely used for the securing of data for a number of
on-line Internet banks.   -Encrypted tunneling products which extend the
corporate Intranet/LAN are now becoming widely available. -Smart cards
are finally appearing in North America.  In Canada alone Visa Cash,
Exact (Proton?), and Mondex are going through trials. -SSL is now widely
used to protect credit card transactions on a number  of internet retail
sites -The US government continues to support key escrow for exported
encryption.  -Major players (i.e. banks, IBM, MS, HP, VeriFone) are
taking steps to integrate  SET into their range of products. -Future
browsers are going to allow smart cards to Interface with the Internet."
QUESTION 2: In your opinion, what are 5-10  main barriers currently that
may prevent the successful implementation and utilization of encryption
technologies in commercial enterprises?
"-Legislation and government intervention for strong encryption.
-Unfamiliarity with the technology will produce mistrust of its
reliability. -Safe key-management processes are difficult to achieve.
This will  reduce the security of cryptography and thus its usefulness
for many  applications. -Cryptography is not user-friendly right now.
Until it becomes so  than it is unlikely to achieve widespread usage.
-Licensing fees for cryptographic algorithms are not cheap.  Until
patents expire for things like the RSA public key algorithm the  costs
of developing reliable cryptographic products will remain high. - There
are a large number of cryptographic products with no clear standards in
"Export regulations."
"Lack of perceived need."
"Lack of expertise among engineers and technicians."
"a) Lack of interest in security b) Concentration on cost c) Lack of
ready-to-use cheap tools d) Legislation and potential legislation e)
Patents and licensing issues"
"Government inadequacies in legislation, Vendors propensity to hand
private keys to government (extrapolate that to insecurity when a person
working for a vendor is bribed to give out a private key), Costs, Public
reluctance in encryption (FUD factor)"
"Threats to roles of traditional players (e.g., SET's effect on card
issuers)., Seamless integration into products., Education of users.,
Regulatory obstacles. Widespread availability."
"1) ease of use, 2) cost of real security, 3) an understanding of
security details, 4) a lack of understanding the difference between
cryptography and security 5) uncertainty as to what the government rules
"- exportability (permissions are needed if a product implements
cryptography, and 2 or more versions of the software has to be build), -
patents (can't exploit algorithms without negotiating royalties)"
"The governments export restrictions on strong cryptographic
" It is not a question of availability of software, but of
interoperability between systems made/sold in different regions of the
"Government FUD. Ease of use. Cost of training etc. Worry about leakage
of secrets."
QUESTION 3: What are activities and projects that can be initiated and
taken to lower and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)?
"a)     Wider accurate  publication of security lapses.
  b),c)  Cheap tools fitted for a job.  I just read a Sun catalogue
       where much of the software (including security software)
       has laughable prices.   Get a straightforward Virtual
       Private Network from 100 pounds for a start.
d)     Do strong lobbying and occupy lawmaker's time with other stuff
       when they seem to be going in the wrong direction.
e)     Wait for some important expiry dates.
       Have more reasonable contact with license-holders.
       Bypass licenses by producing new methods that get less
       restriction."
"Continued integration into key products such as Netscape and IE.
Perhaps even into OSes."
"Lowering the barriers to deploying certification authority
infrastructures for use w/in intranets.  (in terms of cost, ease of
administration, etc.), Further efforts at deregulation."
"Lobby governments, Do not place restrictions for vendor based key
management, Push for totally private key systems"
"A not for profit, global, public education group should be created
whose purpose is to help educate businesses.  Secondarily it should
educate the public on the issues of privacy, but the primary goal should
be to get all businesses (mainly the small ones) to understand that
simple pains can give a great deal of security, and that the cost is
worth the money and time saved from fraud and theft."
"An e-mail program that a "stoned hippy" could use and still not leak
information is needed.  It would not allow too much flexibility, but it
would give "the masses" a hands on feel for what security is and how
crypto plays a role in their everyday life.  Six year old kids and their
grandmothers could be using even this simple security level for e-mail.
It would go a long way because people will ask many questions, and they
will get many answers.  It would more rapidly diffuse the information
and education over the populace (world wide)."
"Develop simple and user-friendly ways to use cryptography and manage
keys effectively."
"Reduce the ability for corporations to patent cryptographic processes,
key-management techniques, and anything other than completely unique
cryptographic algorithms.  We don't need research into new cryptography
we need open access to refinements of what exists.  If people can
patent  those refinements then it reduces the access people have to
these new technologies at the expense of society at large."
"Eliminate export barriers on strong encryption."
"Education (public): crypto is used for authentication as well as
privacy.  It is *not* military or espionage technology.  It is
(required) enabling technology for tomorrow's information superhighway."
"Education (professional): principles of information security taught in
all relevant courses.  (e.g. computing, telecom, electronics, etc)."

organizations and others in significant numbers
22. Healthcare cries out for encryption
23. The military for sensitive non-classified information.
24. Law enforcement is a natural for the internet, if they could agree
on a common security solution.
25. Online banking, online sales and commerce, data protection on
commercial database servers, secure transfer of govt. information, ie.
tax information on citizens.
26. The most widely spread encryption technologies are pgp and
proprietary hardware solutions by different providers like Cylink etc.
SSL is now upcoming.
27. Protection and storage of Archives
28. Person to person communication within an organization.
29. Secure remote communications (over the Internet)
QUESTION 2. In your opinion, what are 5-10  main barriers currently that
may prevent the successful implementation and utilization of encryption
technologies in commercial enterprises?
RESPONSES (# of responses = 22)  TO QUESTION 2:
1. Cryptic user interfaces
2. ITAR regulations, Government regulation or restrictions of use of
strong encryption, Government export restrictions for strong encryption.
3. Ignorance ( pegasus provides REAL encryption )
4. Lack of knowledge of resources available to Business.
5. Misunderstanding that encryption is complicated.
6. Misunderstanding that encryption is costly.
7. General lack of knowledge as to how to write *strong* encryption
8. Lack of integration of strong encryption so that the user must
learn/know too much in order to use it properly
9. General lack of understanding of the necessity of *strong* encryption
10. Difficult to use
11. Slow speed
12. Complexity makes choices difficult since no one can be a full expert
13. Workers have to wait for a supervisor
14. A lack of understanding of the technology
15. The lack of good cost-benefit analysis data
16. On the product development side, few companies have both the
engineering and the marketing/industry expertise to successfully make
good secure products which meet real market needs and demands
17. Key Management. The ability for a user to gain authentification for
use of cryptographic programs, to access information for which that
person is authorized. Passwords can be forgotten, or copied, verifying a
user easily is very difficult.
18. Lack of standards, and most of all lack of good certification
19. The second barrier derives from a missing standard interface in
E-Mail, ftp ...  solutions.so transparently embed widely spread
20. Lack of knowledge of encryption is a big hurdle to it's
implementation.  Non-technical people are required to evaluate the use
of a technological product they may not understand completely.  It's
difficult to put your trust in an algorithm when you don't understand
how it works.
21. Many enterprises may not be aware of how easy it is to begin using
encryption within their organization.
22. Many organizations may not recognize the need to protect information
within their organization.  Some may not be aware of how easy it is to
tap into electronic communications.
QUESTION 3. What are activities and projects that can be initiated and
taken to lower and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)?
RESPONSES (# of responses = 27) TO QUESTION 3:
1. Integrated mail reader with PGP capabilities, easy to use
2. Spreading awareness of how useful strong crypto really is.
3. Spreading awareness of exactly *why* governments seeks to prevent the
spread of crypto.
4. Writing strong encryption software and placing it in the public
5. Proving by actual demonstration that existing encryption is
6. Encouraging wealthy crypto advocates to speak freely.
7. Education of users and vendors of the issues
8. Lobbying of governments by aforementioned enlightened users/vendors
9. Different products need to be created which can interoperate
transparently to the user, but not deliver data unless operator is valid
10. Smart cards which attach to every terminal, the cards go with the
person and they can validate themselves at any terminal
11. Overcoming the complexity barrier requires patient teaching of each
12. A set of brochures and pamphlets needs to be created which describes
most systems in use for a particular level of security
13. A major project would be to simply educate the managers of most
companies about crypto, to remove the magic and bring the whole thing
down to earth
14. Manufacturers need to go to more trouble talking with customers
before designing products and be more creative in finding ways to meet
market needs
15. Security companies also need to audit themselves and demonstrate
that they are trustworthy
16. Better turnkey low-cost enterprise-wide solutions to common problems
(network encryption, for example) are needed.
17. Make applications easier to use, Build easy to use encryption into
applications so that it is smooth or even transparent to users
18. Universal standards for dual key encryption
19. Reduce strength of encryption to increase speed
20. Large groups of customers must get together and dictate standards to
the security industry.
21. The first thing is to implement a transparent interface to
encryption function to all data transfer services.
22. The second would  be to get all suppliers of encryption technologies
to confirm to this standard.
23. I think the best  thing is to initiate a workgroup at The Open Group
responsible for encryption interfaces.
24. Public Software such as PGP should be widely available.  The more
people are experienced with this software the more likely they are to
use and trust it.
25. Making software like PGP widely available means more than just
making sure copies of it are accessible. It also means making it
user-friendly enough.
26. Education is also required.  I find that very few people really know
about these  issues.
27. People need to promote awareness of the current situation.

@_subject: Network library lcrzo 3.13 (fwd) 
Reply-To: laurent.constantin at aql.fr
Version 3.13 of lcrzo is now available.
Lcrzo is a network library, for network administrators and network
Its objective is to easily create network programs.
This library provides network functionnalities for Ethernet, IP, UDP,
TCP, ICMP, ARP and RARP protocols. It supports spoofing, sniffing,
client and server creation. Furthermore, lcrzo contains high level functions dealing with data storage and handling.
Using all these functions, you can quickly create a network test program. Lcrzo, which means "Laurent Constantin Rï¿½ZO" (Rï¿½ZO=network in French), and can be pronounced " 'el' 'sea' 'reso'lv ", is available under the GNU LGPL license. This library was successfully installed under Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.
The library lcrzo provides :
 - network functionnalities :
    + address conversion
    + packet encoding/decoding/printing
    + spoofing
    + real/virtual UDP/TCP clients/servers
    + sniffing
    + device(network board) dealing
    + etc.
 - and general functionnalities :
    + data conversion
    + chained list
    + IPC
    + etc.
Over 200 examples of lcrzo are included in lcrzoex.

** changes **
Lcrzoex/lcrzo 3.13 includes the following changes :
Version 3.13 - 13-june-2001
 ++ bugs ++
  - In functions lcrzo_packet_decodem_xxx, negative sizes weren't
    forbidden : they were converted to big positive numbers. So, a     segmentation fault appeared when a negative parameter was used.
 ++ major evolutions of liblcrzo ++
  - Creation of lcrzo_icmp module. This module can create and
    decode various kinds of ICMP packets (rfc 792).
  - When converting ip addresses to Ethernet addresses, default
    spoofed addresses are the addresses of the local computer
    (a new type is created : LCRZO_INTSPOOF_TYPE_CONF).
    This can be reverted to old behaviour using :
      lcrzo_global_set_intspoof_ip_type(LCRZO_INTSPOOF_TYPE_COMP);
    With the old behaviour, problems appeared because some systems
    keep in mind the false adresses used in ARP requests ; then
    communicating with these systems were temporarily not possible     for other computers (the spoofed one).
 ++ minor evolutions of liblcrzo ++
  - Type of ICMP packets is displayed by lcrzo_hdrlicmp_fprint.
  - The libpcap package modified by RedHat is detected by
    genemake, and the variable LCRZODEF_LIBPCAPFROMREDHAT is
    defined. In the module lcrzo_sniff, this special package
    is now treated separately.
  - The special device "any" is supported in lcrzo_mtu_init_device
    and lcrzo_ipl_init_device. It allows to sniff on all
    devices of the computer.
  - Update of sniff functions to sniff on all devices with "any".
  - Installation on RedHat is easier because pcap.h is searched
    in /usr/include/pcap/.
  - Creation of lcrzo-config which permits to compile easily :
      gcc -o fich fich.c `lcrzo-config -cl`
  - The function pcap_freecode is now called (this function wasn't
    available in versions of libpcap previous to 0.6).
 ++ major evolutions of lcrzoex ++
  - Rewrite of tools 138 and 172 : tcp traceroute.
  - Tools 244..247 : udp and icmp traceroute.
  - Tools 248 and 249 : icmp ping.
  - Tools 250 and 251 : tcp ping.
  - Tools 252 and 253 : tcp port scanner.
  - Tools 254 and 255 : udp port scanner.
  - Tools 256 and 257 : icmp scanner.
 ++ minor evolutions of lcrzoex ++
  - Creation of lcrzoex__0000i.c to separate lcrzoex.c in smaller
    and faster to compile files.

@_subject: The summer of OAEP (fwd) 
These are some of the papers to be presented at Crypto 2001 in August[1]:
   A Chosen Ciphertext Attack On RSA Optimal Asymmetric Encryption
   Padding (OAEP) as Standardized In PKCS    James Manger
   OAEP Reconsidered
   Victor Shoup
   RSA--OAEP is Secure Under the RSA Assumption
   Eiichiro Fujisaki, Tatsuaki Okamoto, David Pointcheval and Jacques
   Stern
   Simplified OAEP for the RSA and Rabin Functions
   Dan Boneh
Shoup's abstract[2] reads:
   The OAEP encryption scheme was introduced by Bellare and Rogaway at
   Eurocrypt '94.  It converts any trapdoor permutation scheme into a
   public-key encryption scheme.  OAEP is widely believed to provide
   resistance against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.  The main
   justification for this belief is a supposed proof of security in the
   random oracle model, assuming the underlying trapdoor permutation
   scheme is one way.
   This paper shows conclusively that this justification is invalid.
   First, it observes that there appears to be a non-trivial gap in
   the OAEP security proof.  Second, it proves that this gap cannot
   be filled, in the sense that there can be no standard "black box"
   security reduction for OAEP.  This is done by proving that there
   exists an oracle relative to which the general OAEP scheme is insecure.
   The paper also presents a new scheme OAEP+ along with a complete
   proof of security in the random oracle model.  OAEP+ is essentially
   just as efficient as OAEP, and even has a tighter security reduction.
   It should be stressed that these results do not imply that a particular
   instantiation of OAEP, such as RSA-OAEP, is insecure.  They simply
   undermine the original justification for its security.  In fact,
   it turns out - essentially by accident, rather than by design -
   that RSA-OAEP is secure in the random oracle model; however this
   fact relies on special algebraic properties of the RSA function,
   and not on the security of the general OAEP scheme.
The Fujisaki, et al abstract[3] reads:
   Recently Victor Shoup noted that there is a gap in the widely-believed
   security result of OAEP against adaptive chosen-ciphertext
   attacks. Moreover, he showed that, presumably, OAEP cannot be
   proven secure from the one-wayness of the underlying trapdoor
   permutation. This paper establishes another result on the security of
   OAEP. It proves that OAEP offers semantic security against adaptive
   chosen-ciphertext attacks, in the random oracle model, under the
   partial-domain one-wayness of the underlying permutation. Therefore,
   this uses a formally stronger assumption. Nevertheless, since
   partial-domain one-wayness of the RSA function is equivalent to its
   (full-domain) one-wayness, it follows that the security of RSA-OAEP
   can actually be proven under the sole RSA assumption, although the
   reduction is not tight.

There is a distinction between a 'search' and 'the method of search'.
Some methods may be more physically invasive than others, but the 4th

The intent to search is ALWAYS invasive.

@_subject: DMCA / When you decrypt, that's illegal (fwd) 
'Digital Bearer Settlement List' An interesting word here is 'unauthorized'. Lets say I am actually paying
for my satellite feed. I build (i.e. 'assemble') a box which descrambles
those channels I have paid for. Am I not now 'authorized'?
By the same analogy to the DCMA: When I buy a DVD, am I not authorized to
play it under the conditions set forward in the [rather irritating] standard
usage agreement, not for public viewing etc.? For that matter, does not the
Home Recording Act give me the right to rip the DVD into another form if it
is for my own personal use?
I have not violated copyright in either of these cases. Assuming I do not
distribute my device/software, I fail to see how I have broken the law, even
in the satellite case. I do admit I might not enjoy the legal case,
especially proving that I am only watching those channels which I am
'authorized' for. I guess some of the question is: when is a crowbar a
burglary tool and when is it just a crowbar.
Or does the DCMA make my decrypting a DVD (which I own) using unauthorized
software (i.e. not part of the consortium) illegal, period?

@_subject: Confusion about Free Speech - polycentric 
Polycentric law is not anarchy. The fact that something is unregulated
does not equate to anarchy either. Polycentric law is clearly not
equivalent to unregulated either. For each center to communicate and
cooperate there MUST be agreements (ie tests of faith and intent) between
the factions. Those agreements must, in a large part at least, follow the
tenets and beliefs of each party. If there is too disparate a difference
between the cultures then no cooperation is really possible. Anarchy is the denial of regulation, not the lack of same. Randomness does not equal
Most people (actually most life) live lives where one day looks pretty
much like the next. Anarchy is not a norm anywhere (ie animal societies or
even say a rain forest as an example of a multi-dependent ecology) except
in human society. Why? Because there's no possibility for a 'leader' to
develop in the first place.
Anarchy is a function of human psychology, not some axiomatic aspect of
nature. It's a rejection of 'community' in a real sense (consider what
happens to a wolf that breaks the pack code).

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 528  March 1, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein, and
James Riordon
SWITCHABLE X-RAY STORAGE.  Recently we reported on
two experiments at Harvard (Update 521) in which a light signal
enters a volume of gas where, under the action of an additional
control laser beam, it is greatly slowed; in fact, as the signal slows
down to zero the light energy is coherently converted into a
collective excitation of the spins of the
atoms in the gas.  Later the light signal can be resurrected and sent
on its way.  It has come to our attention that something like this,
only in a nuclear system, was reported in an article some four years
ago (Shvyd'ko et al., Physical Review Letters, 7 October 1996).  In
the earlier experiment, conducted at HASYLAB (DESY) in
Hamburg (contact Yuri Shvyd'ko, University of Hamburg, 49-40-
8998-2200, yuri.shvydko at desy.de), the incoming light consists of
x rays, and the receiving medium is an ensemble of iron-57 nuclei,
ensconced in a FeBO3 crystal.  All 10^18 iron nuclei in the 20-
micron-thick sample interact collectively in a single "nuclear
exciton" state with each new incoming x-ray photon. As APS
Editor-in-Chief Martin Blume (631-591-4000) points out, such a
"solid-state nuclear physics" effect is well known also under the
name of coherent nuclear resonant scattering.  By abrupt switching
of a weak (60 Gauss) external magnetic field, the nuclear exciton
can be manipulated in such a way that its decay is prohibited.  In
this way the x rays are stored, and can be released on demand by
reversing the magnetic switching.  The released light signal is
coherent with the incoming one. The coherence of quantum
information transfer is perfectly preserved.  Put differently, one
can say that in the Harvard experiments the atoms, behaving like
tiny electric dipoles, converted the incoming light into a coherent
excitation of atomic spins (a polariton), whereas in the HASYLAB
experiment the iron nuclei, behaving like tiny magnetic dipoles,
converted the incoming x rays into a coherent nuclear excitation
spread over the whole crystal (a nuclear exciton).  As in the
Harvard experiments, the pent-up electromagnetic energy stored in
the system can be released (and sent moving in its original
direction) by the flip of a switch, in this case by adjusting the
external magnetic field  direction.

TBS Superstation Offers Unprecedented Look at U.S. Military Combat
  Scenarios in WAR GAMES.
  Entertainment Editors
  NOTE TO MEDIA: Photo is available in a Smart News Release(TM) on
  Business Wire's Home Page at   ATLANTA--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2000
  Reality television takes an exciting turn when TBS Superstation presents the
  first-ever in-depth original entertainment production detailing authentic
  combat-readiness military exercises.
  WAR GAMES offers a rare, up-close look at military competitions including
  air-to-air dogfighting, submarine warfare, urban combat and "live fire"   fighting
  exercises.
  This action-packed, two-hour original special, premiering in March 2001, is   being
  produced with the full cooperation of the United States military.
  "The unprecedented access and cooperation that TBS Superstation's cameras
  have received from the U.S. military will take our viewers to the front   lines of
  authentic combat exercises," said Jim Head, senior vice president of   programming for the Superstation. "WAR GAMES fits perfectly into our   of providing exciting, high-profile and provocative original programming   appeals to the Regular Guy and the people in his life. We are already   looking at
  this special as a pilot for a potential series."
  WAR GAMES will present four different combat scenarios, with commentators
  reporting from each competition, as well as personal stories from the
  participating military troops.
  The following are descriptions of the four games scheduled to be included   in TBS
  Superstation's WAR GAMES:
  RED FLAG
  After Vietnam, the United States Air Force created Red Flag, an air-to-air   air-to-ground military exercise designed to better train pilots for the   high-stress,
  high-action situations they often confront in combat. In this scenario,   engage in a dogfight over the Nevada desert before diving into "enemy"   territory in
  an attempt to bomb an airfield.
  WOLF HUNT
  Enemy submarines claimed 80 percent of the ships sunk in World War II--and
  the threat of subs is just as potent today. The United States Navy conducts
  critical anti-submarine warfare exercises off the coast of San Diego in this
  exercise, in which two helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft must locate   sink an enemy submarine before the submarine sinks our battleship.
  JRTC (Joint Readiness Training Center)
  Increasingly, military operations are conducted in cities and towns.   Recognizing
  this, the United States Army built an entire mock town to train troops in
  urbanized warfare. In this realistic 11-day war game, U.S. forces must rescue a
  town and its residents from hostile forces, as soldiers are exposed to the
  hazards of urbanized warfare, including civilians and media on the field of   battle.
  CAX (COMBINED ARMED EXERCISES)
  CAX features the United States Marine Corps in a three-day, locked and   live-fire deployment involving thousands of Marines. In this exercise,   must first assault and occupy enemy territory, then defend it against a
  counter-assault in the California desert.
  Executive producers for War Games are J.J. Jamieson and John Barchilon. Mike
  Sears is directing and David Hudson is producing. WAR GAMES is produced by
  Grindstone Productions and Avenue Pictures Television.
  TBS Superstation is the TV Haven for the Regular Guy. Turner Broadcasting
  System, Inc.'s flagship entertainment network, the Superstation reaches 80.7
  million households and is cable's most-watched network, a position it has   for 23 consecutive years. TBS Superstation offers high-profile original   movies and
  series, blockbuster movies, popular series and sports, all reflecting the   attitudes,
  tastes, values and beliefs of the Regular Guy and the people in his life.   Superstation's Web site is located at TBSsuperstation.com.

It comes from 'precede' to 'come first or before' as in importance or
scope of coverage (with respect to court authority).
The Constitution is clearly superior in authority over any and all courts
in America. Therefore any ruling they may emit must comply with the
Constitution. Quibling over whether that fits the strictest legal
definition of 'precedence' is nothing more than a strawman.

Opposite ends of the same thing. You can't have one without the other so
in a very real way to eat a potato is to chew on a potato branch (in a
figurative way of course).
You draw a false distinction, the Constitution starts out with what
     Section. 1.
     All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a
     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and
     House of Representatives.

Really? Where is that written? The Declaration of Independance clearly
doesn't support the proposition of 'limited' breaking of bonds between two
people. It didn't say we 'demand partial independance'.
The reality is that ALL law in this country was 'reset' (to use modern
parlance) with the Declaration of Independence.
The reality of todays common law and all precedence based law for that
matter is it is based on a simple principle,
"I got away with it yesterday, so I can do it today."
Unfortunately (for you, it's okey dokey by me) the ends don't justify the
means (well at least in a democracy).
All law, per the Constition, arises out of legislation through Congress.
Even if we accept your point, it still MUST pass Constitutional muster,
10th Amendments 'delegation' clause. Simply being 'common law' does not
exempt that law from the 10th Amendment.
But your point does raise an additional complaint against the concept of
'common law' as equivalent to 'court created' law, and that is there is no
specific delegation to create a set of laws that are 'common'.
So, a claim to 'common law' still does nothing to eliminate, let alone
actually answer, my question about 'right to lie'.

I believe the last couple of days with two lawyers and a couple of wanna
be's clearly demonstrate the primary problem of todays judicial system.
The courts are not concerned with The Law, they are concerned with their
continued existance. This is exemplified by lawyers making reference to
'precedence' instead of 'the law' (ie a codified set of laws that are
applicable to all).
It's supposed to be 'equal protection under the law', not 'equal
protection by the courts'.
A court <> the law.

Recently I needed a way of generating an
unpredictable permutation function of 32-bit
values, in other words, a block cipher with a
32-bit block. It was important for that
application that 32-bit values generated over a
period of time should not repeat. I searched
around looking for such a cipher, and couldn't
find one, not surprisingly since it would be
insecure in the face of a codebook style attack
(the entire codebook would fit into 16GB).
Anyway, that didn't change the fact that I needed
one, so I wrote one. I took Skipjack (Panu
Rissanen 's version) and turned it
into a 24-round feistel cipher. It retains the
F-table, the G-permutation and the key-schedule
(including the 80-bit keys), but it loses the
feedback register structure and the two different
kinds of rounds.
Then for the fun of it I applied for, and
received, an export license from the Australian
Defence Signals Directorate that allows me to post
it on the Web. It's at:
   It's freely available, and I hope it is of use to
someone else too. If anyone sees any problems with
it, please do tell me.

An update of the 3rd release is now available at
This is likely to be the last shipment using the original protocol;
the next release will probably be called the 4th edition and will use
the new version of 9P.
Today's update is substantially larger than previous ones, but there
are substantially more things updated....
There are a number of new things, including:
- Support for Lucent Orinoco (Wavelan) cards (thanks to Francisco
- Support for the Netgear GA620 gigabit Ethernet cards.
- A much faster VNC viewer, vncviewer(1).
- A preliminary kernel for the Compaq iPAQ h3650 and h3630, also known
- A new compression/decompression library, flate(2).
- A new library for grouped allocation, bin(2), plus a per-process
- A variety of tweaks to libc including case-insensitive string
- Multiple boot configurations in plan9.ini(8).
- Partial support of X.509 certificates.
- Partial support of PNG images.
- New Acme interfaces for news and wiki.
- Support for rc(1)-style quoted strings in the C library, quote(2).
- A preliminary library of graphic controls (widgets);
There are plenty of bugs fixed, too.
Kernel and networking fixes include:
- Better timesync algorithms (no longer requiring floating point).
- TCP/IP:
- ip/dhcpd:
- Graphics:
- Libmp + libsec completely replace libcrypt.
And of course zillions of other application and library fixes and

The UPS uses very effective computer character recognition. How long do
you think it'll take 'em (if they aren't now) to drop a traffic analysis
system in there to look for 'known writing samples'? Not very long I
suspect. And mail is tracked with respect to pickup by the very way it's
sorted in the bag. You could cause a slight hickup here by using
convenient drop boxes but that is getting a tad rare (not to mention most

of cops would go through some tape if they knew the specific date the
letter was dropped? I think so.)
Using a typewriter or laser printer won't help, each leave characteristic
You people should spend more time looking in forensics texts.

The claim is that it is unlikely there are any MO vendors which are not
protected by a video camera currently. In fact, probably haven't been for
quite a number of years. It's the nature of the business. You couldn't
even get insurance for such a business w/o a camera on premises. the same
goes for liquior licenses and such as well. I would be so bold as to say
that there hasn't been a single 'convenience store' (unless perhaps a
family privately owned w/o insurance - rare industry speaking) in this
country since the mid-80's that didn't have at least one camera on the
cash register area so that each and every customer gets a 'mug shot'. I'd
say there are zero such stores today and probably through most of the 90's
as well.
That you would even question such an obvious situation is pretty amazing.
Call your own insurance company and ask them what the rate differences are
between a store that sells MO's, liquior, etc. w/ a video surveillance
system, or one without. Then ask them if they can give you at least a
percentage of total sales between the two classes. Then call the city and
ask them if they require security systems to get a business license (some do, some don't).
No, I said that on average once the LEA had your photo AND you had ever
had a state issued photo ID that it would take about three days for them
to find your picture. The systems are getting better and better and the
inter-connects over the last few years have gotten much broader. I'd
suggest getting subscriptions to the government and LEA trade mags.
If they've got things like partial license or a name it won't take them
that long.
Consider you drive your vehicle to the store. Purchase a MO. There is
clearly a security camera because you watch yourself, watch yourself,
watch yourself, ... I digress
Anyway, you take your MO and leave the store safe that all they've got is
your photo and you've never had a license issued. Your driving illegally
is not an issue. You commit whatever sin against god, nature, and the
American way it is that floats your boat that particular day. The police
tie the MO. They go to the store and ask for the appropriate tape. In fact
they ask for both tapes.
Both tapes?
You didn't see the camera on the corner that got the shot of your car and
license plate?
I can especially suggest their low-light b/w CCD. I use mine on a 8"
Newtonian to shoot the moon.
That your logic is fuzzy because you know very little about the mechanics
of the physical security business.

Dude, they feed full video through a fiber cable that fits in the center
shaft of the clock hands. They put them in fire detectors (and they still
detect to boot), they put them in the holes of the ceiling tile. You could
look all day long and not see it.
You must 'look'. I doubt they'd let you take their building apart. If it's
a government office or handles any sort of cargo of worth there will a
video camera feeding a slow-scan video recorder it's a function of
getting insurance and legal liability.
You can take that to the bank.

Generaly they keep a tape for a week to a month or so. Most companies see
this sort of stuff as 'mission critical'. Some place like 7-11 may send
them off to a central site for storage up to a year. Remember the tapes
are critical evidence for INTERNAL issues as well. They are prime evidence
of theft, etc. If it's one of these big chain stores they feed the 5-10
fps signal out their VSAT for off-site storage and that can be kept for up
to a year.
MO's have a time limit. the Travellers Express I have in hand is 1 year (3
years in CA). You can't get one for more than about $400 anymore, and any
single site can't do you more than like $2000 in any 24 hour period.
The thesis that you're going to buy MO's and then delay using them is
probably effective if you are aware of the MO issuers security policies.
If not then you're better off using them as fast as possible. Of course if
you need this sort of protection you probably shouldn't buy them from your
city and probably shouldn't mail them from either of these two cities. Now
not only is there a MO trail, but a correlated travel trail as well. Of
course we'll pay for everything with cash and sign nothing. That will help
a lot, though we won't be flying, renting a car, or sleeping in hotels. We
should also do it in such a way that the day or two we're out catting
about nobody misses us. So work won't need us and family and friends won't
miss us either. How often can you pull that off before somebody starts
getting curios?
Traffic Analysis is a bitch. Evidence everywhere.

If the SC doesn't rule and let it just sit there won't this be the same as

One reason they may not want to rule is they realize the consequences. And
by letting it die a quite death they lose nothing and hold future options
open. This of course would be predicated upon the vast majority of the SC
wanting to rule in favor of IR searches but recognizing there isn't a
realistic constitutional argument to support such action.
It would effectively squash the current action and give them about 2 years
of breathing room. While this scenario is not probable it is clearly not
completely unlikely either.
In addition it raises the interesting question of what would say a 2 year
delay gain? A very different bench? How many are likely to retire in the
next two years?

I don't know if I'd go that far. I can say that I've spent many years
looking for it as an intellecutal exercise and I've yet to find a system
that couldn't be cracked with good forensics and a search warrant.
Another aspect is whether you want the entire transaction anonymous or
just some aspect of it.
For example, you could arrange to meet a bum at one time and place. Have
the bum execute your plan (ie go into store and then head down street) and
then meet you at another time and place. Have the two meeting in a
residential neighborhood where you've scoured the neighborhood for obvious
external cameras. The point here is to increase the cost of the cops
finding the video. If they see a video camera on a house and they say saw
the bum turn down that street from the store camera they could subpeona
that camera. So you'd want to create a situation where the cost to find
the camera was prohibitive. This of course has its own problems like the
bum running off w/ your money. There'd still be the geographic similarity
you, the bum, the store, and the MO share. You'd probably never want to
use that site or bum again. And so on.
My personal belief is there is no security. That the best you can hope for
is an escalating growth in complexity and cost. Others differ on this point.

Not at all. My initial point was that it had media coverage. It was simply
a inquisitive observation about the priority setting mechanisms of the
COMMERCIAL media and how even 'independent critical' press had economic
incentives as well. It further demonstrate the asymmetry in the results
with respect to what is 'important' enough to be 'news'.
As I've said before in this forum, not all 'cooperative' behaviour is
necessarily a 'conspiracy', if enough people act in concert the effect is
the same. In many cases it is the quantity and not the intent that is
important. Is the 'economic' theory of the 'guiding hand' not the same sort
of 'conspiracy' theory?

What was that sporting event again? How many faces searched for across how
many attendants REAL TIME? I'd venture they were searching n*m way in the
range of 100,000 comparisons a second (and a single photo is a 'm way'
search) and when one considers the base population of the US (300 million)
and the number with records (say 1/3 of that) divided up across 50 states
(remember the MO records reduce your geographic population to a couple of
million, with sex and age you reduce it to say half or quarter that). The
technology exists. Consider the police in London, from previous emails to
this list, about their experiments in using face recognition in
identifying in near real time. Consider the two posts I sent earlier that
demonstrate the unanimous state to state adoption of these sorts of
technologies to integrate their existing database with a variety of
'foreign' data bases over the last several years. Photo identification and
management is a primary goal in every one of them.
No, like it or not, the system is here and with sufficient motivation the
priority to apply could be arranged. They're not going to do it for buying
a nickel bag of pot at the park or running a stop sign. But that isn't my
claim anyway. Hell, taking the photo to the local cops (like the security
guards at the store) will at least determine if you're a regular or not.
If not that might delay it, might not. My suspicion is when we look at any
particular record (and my claim was an 'average' or statistical claim) the
results won't be necessarily predictable.
The primary factor will be if the particular local agency already has
access worked out as a matter of course. If not then it will be delayed as
it goes to the state police or perhaps a different community police force.
They will have their own priorities....
The value of video as a security agent is the fact that visual
identification has become routine.

demonstrates POV only, neither the lottery operator or the party placing

There is also no clear mechanism to guarantee the winner is the same party

Various have written:
"coderpunks at toad.com" would match To: fields of 26 of the last 60 spam
messages.  No hits in cc: - guess it's not so popular in spam.  There's
also "resent-to" and "resent-cc", and of course bcc (and how do you
spot that?...)  Of course, anything to "Undisclosed.recipients at toad.com"
is pretty glaring.
To be really effective, a spam filter has to look for less obvious
"spam signatures" that aren't so easily spoofed.  For instance, there
was once a spam package that sent out date fields that looked like:
(and since when has PDT applied in january?)  Authors of real mail
programs have to worry about y2k considerations, international users,
and other considerations that never bother spammers.
I've got "a few simple filters" on all mail I receive (actually, more
than a few these days), including that from coderpunks.  Until these
last 2 flurries of spam, I thought I was doing pretty good.  I did
catch a few, but it was like 10%--pathetic.  Now I understand (from the
URL above) why my filters lost it big-time - apparently I'm filtering
the spam that's already been through "a few simple filters" upstream of
me.  It looks like I'll be doing a lot more content based spam
filtering.  I've already got 3 of them going...
I don't know what toad.com says [if anything] when it bounces spam, but
I bounce spam with a bible quote.  Last thing I want to tell the
spammer is how to get around the filter.  I hope instead they'll pull
my address from their list as "undeliverable".  Unfortunately, I also
bounce the occasional legitimate mail with a bible quote - them's the breaks.
I hate to think this might all be due to some silly dispute with
an ISP -- things ought not to get to that point.
One random thought: I wonder if we've created any of this problem
ourselves?  For instance, if any of us has an automated script that
sends a spam complaint off to the "responsible parties", it's
possible those scripts have decided it's toad.com's fault the spam
got sent, and fired an inflamatory message off to verio...
I know I don't do this (I no longer get mad, I get even.  My filters
protect 20,000 mailboxes...), but perhaps others of us?
Me to (well, except I didn't try to contact the moderator--which is um,
don't we have more than one?, um...)  That's the problem - both when
the spam overwhelms legitimate content, and when talk turns to dealing
with the problem.  I had proposed the "few simple filters" approach on
the list a long long while back--wish it had been done sooner so the
spammers wouldn't have had quite so many CD-roms out with coderpunks@
on it.  The latest round of bounces had me seriously wondering about
just was happening (had space aliens swapped the brains of Spamford
and Gilmore?)
A more "interesting" way to do the "simple filter" approach (and one
that might actually have some real relevance to the purpose of this
list!) might be something that actually uses cryptography.  For
instance, one solution might be to have a web server that supplies a
cryptographic "token", good for one mailing through the mailing list.
Simply cut & paste somewhere in the body of the message, and the mail
list software could remove the token before delivery.  It can even be
anonymous (web server hands it out to anyone) - the idea here isn't
actually to secure or authenticate the content, but simply to put an
obstacle that prevents automated scripts, regular mmf spammers and the
usual lot of scum from actually posting anything to the list.  If
mail missing the token is delivered to the moderator(s) even mail
missing the magic token could be forwarded if it were relevant,
although I don't think the moderators would want to encourage this
as a matter of habit.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 563  October 30, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein, and
James Riordon
WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE? This may seem to be more of a question
for psychologists than physicists. But two researchers (Joseph
Wakeling, jwakeling at webdrake.net, now at the University of
Fribourg, Switzerland, and Per Bak, Imperial College, 011-44-20-
7594-8528, p.bak at ic.ac.uk) argue that intelligence is not an abstract
concept, but must be considered as a physical phenomenon. Any
definition of intelligence, they say, cannot ignore a living being's
environment, including its very own body. In their view, an organism
is only intelligent relative to how well it solves the problems that its
surroundings throw at it. This runs counter to many historical ideas,
including the concept that the mind is separate from the body, or that it
is possible to build a desktop computer that thinks like a human
without having the same physical environment or body. To explore the
idea of intelligence, the researchers ran computer simulations of
artificial neural networks called "minibrains." In the simulations, 251
minibrains each attempted to pick the less popular of two choices, 0
and 1, analogous to 251 motorists all trying to pick the less congested
road.  This "Minority Game" would be repeated over many successive
rounds. Each minibrain consisted of three layers of "neurons": "input
neurons," which dictated how many past rounds it could remember,
leading to an intermediary layer, which then led into an "output" layer
that determined what choice was made. If the minibrain ending up
making an incorrect choice, it would reduce the strength of the
connections between neurons supplying the "wrong answer." The
researchers were in for a surprise when they endowed all of the
minibrains with equal abilities, which would be analogous to a bunch
of motorists with the same amount of decision-making skill. In this
situation, no minibrains correctly guessed the minority choice with
even a 50 percent success rate, which is what you'd get by making the
choice with a random flip of a coin. Even an E. coli bacterium, which
searches for glucose by moving in random directions in its
environment, is seemingly more intelligent than this. Only when the
researchers introduced a "rogue" minibrain with more intermediate
neurons to analyze the past rounds did it attain more than a 50 percent
success rate.  Their simulations suggest that intelligence often hinges
on how much one can make use of the data in its physical
environment. (Wakeling and Bak, Physical Review E, November

the following from a thread on some of the fees related to fraud issues at
specifically from a thread on Visa/MasterCard Antitrust Comments.
Here's an interesting quote taken directly from Judge Barbara Nelson's
decision (the full text of the decision is available at:
"Defendants' ability to price discriminate also illustrates their market
Both Visa and MasterCard charge differing interchange fees based, in part,
on the degree to which a given merchant category needs to accept general
purpose cards.
Transactions with catalog and Internet merchants, for example, which rely
almost completely on general purpose cards, have higher interchange fees
than 'brick and mortar' merchants.
Defendants rationalize this difference by pointing to increased fraud in
these merchant categories, but this explanation is belied by the fact that
the Internet merchant, not Visa/MasterCard or their member banks, bears
virtually all the risk of loss from fraudulent transactions.
Even today, Amazon's fraud rate is lower than mail-order companies, yet it
is charged (indirectly, through the merchant discount) the same interchange
fee as these mail order companies.
The reality is that Visa and MasterCard are able to charge substantially
different prices for those hundreds of thousands of merchants who must take
credit cards at any price because their customers insist on using
those cards."

i believe i said that ROI represented the total cost of the program to
eliminate some fraud  compared to the total amount of fraud. in the credit
card scenerio it isn't enuf to know the cost per event. assuming that
adding chips to those payment cards is a solution. in there US there are
something less than a billion new cards sent out each year ... and adding a
chip could cost on the order of $25 each. Just for the chips (ignoring for
the moment the issue of reader provisioning) ... that cost might be
somewhere in the $15b to $20b per annum range. There would have to be a
huge number of $3500 per fraud events eliminated by a comprehensive chip
program to justify it.
so as referenced in the previous postings .... advances in technology can
reduce the cost of dealing with fraud (in the chip card case ... it would
be nice to reduce it from $20b/annum to maybe under $1b/annum; say a
combination of significantly reduced chip costs as well as the number of
new sent out each year) while at the same time increasing the amount of
fraud (criminals find it easier to counterfiet existing cards increasing
the amount of traud that happens).
However, generically (except for some specific exceptions), the majority of
fraud has tended to be insider fraud. Just improving things with strong
authentication &/or identification doesn't directly address insider fraud,
significant audit, command & control, and compensating procedures are
needed to be in place to address significant amounts of insider fraud (who,
effectively by definition, have already been authenticated and identified).

Tim (and other C-A-C-L proponents) have opined that a 'business' has the
'right' to refuse service to anyone for any reason. This is clearly
contrary to both the concept of 'rights' and 'free market' (and is
diametricaly opposed to what C-A-C-L proponents claim(!) to want).
Things don't have rights. A business is a thing. It is a mechanism whereby
one or more people get from here to there. It is analgous to a bicycle and
moving from point A to point B. While the people riding the bike clearly
have a right to get from A to B by any mechanism that doesn't interfere
with others it is a long slide into insanity to then say the bike has
equivalent 'rights'.
A business can refuse to serve anyone they desire for any reason, but the
market such a business operates in is not(!!!) a free market by any
definition that folks like von Mises or Hayek would recognize as such. Now
C-A-C-L proponents claim (of which this is just another example of their
hypocrisy or ignorance - take your pick [1]) that they want to create a
free market that is universal in all human activity. Clearly this isn't
possible operating under Tim and his supporters particular brand of 'free'
which is nothing more than 'freedom for me, not for thee'. A business has
the RESPONSIBILITY to refuse service to anyone which threatens that
business' operations. They also have a responsibility to make that
reaction as minimaly invasive as possible in all cases, no exceptions.
There is no "..., but..." in free market or American democracy.

This document is an ongoing project where I take comments and observations
from others and post their questions and my replies. Some of this material
is old and some is new. It is intended to demonstrate that when the
Constitution as a whole is applied to sensitive issues it in fact provides
clear direction on the limits and character of the relation between the the
three arms of the government of the United States; federal, state, and
individual. I assume that anyone commenting on this document is giving their
explicit permission to include them with my replies unless otherwise noted.
I would prefer that all discussion take place on the Cypherpunks public
mailing list. I will submit all my responces to submissions to that list. If
you don't wish to discuss this issue in a public forum please do not respond
to me. I have no interest in private discussion on this topic.
This country is going through a crisis of civil liberties and a fundamental
loss of faith in the tenets of democracy. It is becoming more fascist (ie
public management of private property) on a daily basis. In the near future
it could become completely socialist (ie public management of public
property and elimination of private property) in the name of the greater
good. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or
the individual is in direct conflict with both the spirit and words of the
Constitution. Legislative, judicial, and executive branch decisions and
actions speak to this on a daily basis. One of the most controversial topics
is the private ownership of weapons and the duty of the government to
regulate the same. The current discussion on both sides is limited solely to
the 2nd Amendment. Unfortunately this is a stillborn position because it
misses fundamental issues and questions. To address those I have listed each
of the relevant sections of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Perusal
of these make it clear that the right of the individual to own and bear arms
with no interference or regulation is a fundamental right of every American.
This right is justified by a long history of abuse by political systems of
the individual as well as a continous sequence of physical assaults on the
It is worth making special note that the Presidential claim to executive
privilige regarding the use of military forces without Congressional
permission is unconstitutional (see Article II). The Constitution clearly
states the President is the commander in chief of the armed forces only
after they have been called into action. And only Congress may call them
into action unless it can not be conveined. The President of the United
States is not in the chain of command of the military forces without
specific authorization from Congress. Until such time as that is given only
Congress has the authority to direct and organize military activities. This
means that the President may direct military forces only until Congress
convenes. At that point Congress must decide whether to agree to commit the
Amendment 2, 4, & 9 provide in and of themselves sufficient grounds to find
any federal involvement in the purchase, possession, or operation of a
weapon to be unconstitutional. One of the most specious argumenst in this
discussion is that 'the people' in the 2nd Amendment is not to be construed
as meaning the individual. However, it is clear from the Constitution itself
and other amendments, such as the 4th, that this simply is not so. The term
'the people' means that the decision regarding such issues is to be made at
the level of the individual. In other words whether a particular individual
agrees to participate is completely voluntary.
                   THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
   We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
   union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the

   of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish

  represent us, is to provide freedom of choice (i.e. liberty) for each
  individual (i.e. 'ourselves and our posterity'). This means that any
  claim that 'the people' does not refer to the individual and their
  right to make individual choices is specious and misdirected. ]
  Article I
   Section 8. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,
   duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the
   common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all
   duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United
   States;
   To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules
   concerning captures on land and water;
   To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use
   shall be for a longer term than two years;
   To provide and maintain a navy;
   To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval
   forces;
   To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the
   union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;
[ Note it says 'the militia', not plural and definitely not state oriented
  since states are prohibited from raising or supporting troops. Note that
  it specificaly directs Congress and the President to use the Militia for
  internal issues only. ]
   To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and
   for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of
   the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the
   appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia
   according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;
[ This says Congress organizes, armes, and disciplines the militia - again
  nothing to do with the states and no implication of plurality. The only
  job the states have is appointing officers. One can argue over the wording
  of the training since it is ambigous. I interpet "..., reserving to the
  states repesctively, the appointment of the officers, .." as being a
  single clause and not carrying over to "... authority of training ...". ]
   No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of
   tonnage, keep troops, or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any
   agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power, or
   engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as
   will not admit of delay.
[ This last paragraph is of special importance. It directs the states to
  provide for their self defence during times of truly imminent danger.
  There is also the implication of immediate responce. Yet the state can
  not keep troops or even collect taxes to this end. This also excludes the
  Militia since it is under federal control and can't be used by the states
  without federal consent. In other words they are not to base their responce
  solely on state or federal employees. The  implication is that each state is
  directed to provide for individual firearms ownership.
  It's also worth noting that if the US is actualy invaded and the federal
  forces are activated the states are still directed to raise forces
  independently of the federal forces, and these forces would be under
  state control and operated in parallel with federal forces. In addition
  this delegates the states to independant resistance even if the federal
  authorities surrender. It is a fundamental recognition of the states
  independence. [1] ]
  Article II
   Section 2. The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and
   Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states,
   when called into the actual service of the United States; he may
   require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of
   the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of
   their respective offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves
   and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of
   impeachment.
[ This last paragraph describes how the President takes control of the
  military. It is only after Congress agrees to release the authority.
  Normal day to day training and patrol duties are responsible to Congress
  only. ]
  Article IV
   Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in this
   union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them
   against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the
   executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic
   violence.
[ Note this says that federal forces can not be employeed within a state
  without the explicit permission of the state government during periods of
  domestic violence. In other words "rioting in the streets" is not a
  sufficient condition for forced federal involvement through martial law.
  The state legislature is the prefered authority unless it can't be convened
  in time. In that case the state governor can make the decision but as soon as
  the state legislature is convened he's out of the picture. This means that
  states always have the option of refusing federal assisstance. This means the
  various forced tax and funds refusal threats of the federal government are
  unconstitutional. This means states have the option of opting out of any
  federal gun control regulations. ]
                             THE BILL OF RIGHTS
   The Conventions of a number of the States having, at the time of
   adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent
   misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and
   restrictive clauses should be added, and as extending the ground of
   public confidence in the Government will best insure the beneficent
   ends of its institution;
   Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
   States of America, in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses
   concurring, that the following articles be proposed to the
   Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution
   of the United States; all or any of which articles, when ratified by
   three-fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and
   purposes as part of the said Constitution, namely:
  Amendment II
   A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
   state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
   infringed.
[ This one really speaks for itself once you've understood the rest. They
  are actualy speaking of *two* seperate entities - the single federal
  Militia *and* the individual citizen. They are *not* one and the same. ]
  Amendment III
   No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without
   the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be
   prescribed by law.
  Amendment IV
   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
   and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
   violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
   supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
   place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
[ Our current society has a problem with what is understood to be
  'reasonable'. This is a strong indication that we need to create a new
  amendment to better describe the interface, expectations, and limits
  of actions regarding state representatives and the individual. The only
  other option is to eliminate laws respecting consensual crimes such as
  individual drug use, abortion, etc.
  Arguments based on 'community standard' are inherently broken. It implies
  the community has some homogenious standard, there is certainly no
  indication of authority to sample the populate with respect to this
  question. The religious and free speech and press clauses
  prohibit it. It further prohibits laws and acts respecting law
  enforcement based on statistical averages, profiles, mass searches,
  bumper stickers, public statements not inciteing something worse than
  domestic violence, etc. Note that this *does* give Congress the option of
  training the militia for operations involving nuclear, biological, or
  chemical attack for domestic use. (I believe that any such use must
  not allow weapons for other than personal defence to these federal
  forces. No tanks, bombs, missiles, etc.)
  You can't use an individuals beliefs as a basis for law. In that case, with
  no sample, the only question is would any citizen object to the
  behaviour? It is obvious the question must be answered in the negative
  since you have such an example at hand from the community. This effectively
  eliminates consensual crimes. If an activity does not cause physical harm
  to a person, their property, or a voluntary public trust it can't be made
  against the law at the federal level. (I don't believe a coersive public
  trust can exist under our Constitution. You can't punish a state or throw
  a citizen in jail because they object to participate in federal programs.) ]
  Amendment IX
   The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
   construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[ This one is really short and sweet. If anybody has a right then everybody
  has the right. There are no womens rights, gay rights, or minority rights;
  only human rights.
  This amendment prevents the government from even addressing what a persons
  rights are by the simple expedient that it prevents the federal or state
  government from even enumerating what they aren't. In other words unless
  the authority over some activity is proscribed in the Constitution the
  question of jurisdiction and decision are the individual states.
  It also means that the Supreme Court is prevented from using rulings that
  are of the enumerable type. In other words, simply because there isn't a
  directive in the Constitution is not sufficient reason to deny the
  individual the right of expression, or choice of execution. So arguments
  such as 'assissted suicide" isn't a right because there is no indication in
  the Constitution are specious and deny recognized fundamental individual
  rights in the 1st Amendment. So, in the case of gun control if there is a
  question at the federal level of jurisdiction (ie "What is meant by 'the
  people'?) the decision goes to the states and their individual constitutions.
  If it's not covererd in their individual constitutions then individuals in
  those states may make the decision on an individual basis. The Constitution
  is designed to fail-safe under questions of federal authority to the states
  or the individual. If Congress can't provide a delegate entry in the
  Constitution per the 10 th. it must suggest a constitutional amendment to
  the states. The current question of gun control has only two outcomes. Either
  individuals have their right to own guns recognized or the Congress and the
  state legislatures are required to mold an amendment to clarify the 2nd
  Amendment. The states can always stop federal aquisition of new
  authority at this point by simply refusing to put the amendment up for vote.
  At this point the states have a tacit admission of their supreme authority
  in such questions. ]
  Amendment X
   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
   prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states
   respectively, or to the people.
[ This amendment severely limits what the federal level of authority covers.
  It requires the Congress to provide a delegate, one or more sentences,
  in the Constition for all laws (and I believe for all suggested bills as
  well). it further specifies that in questions of dispute the decision goes
  to the individual states and their republican governments (ie state
  constitution). If the indvidual states don't regulate the activity it is up
  to the individual to participate voluntarily.
  The United States of America is a balkanized collection if independant
  states who voluntarily give up limited authority to the federal level, they
  must explicitly agree to this to become a state. ]

What is 'perfect competition'?
"According to the generally accepted view, perfect competition
1. A homogenous commodity offered and demanded by a large number of
   relatively small sellers and buyers, none of whom expects to exercise
   by his actiona perceptible influence on price.
2. Free entry into the market and absence of other restraints on the
   movement of prices and resources.
3. Complete knowledge of the relevant factors on the part of all
   participants in the market."

The Meaning of 'Competition'
The reality is that Tim's believe that he can refuse to serve a customer
because they hold or perhaps practice some action that (while not
involving him or his property directly, only his apparently fragile
emotional ego) he finds offensive is within the bounds of free market
econoimics is just plain crap.
Hayek's views on fascism and socialism are well known, and not positive.
What Tim proposes is nothing more than fascism at the individual level.

No, Hayek wouldn't have. Otherwise he wouldn't have been an apponent of
regulated economies (in particular both socialist and fascist). Why was he
against regulated economies? Because they don't offer the same
opportunities to ALL the members of the market (buyer
and seller alike).
If Hayek were alive today and you asked him,
"Do you support a business in a free market refusing to sell to Jews?"
His answer would have been decidedly in the negative. Hayek supported
'free choice' for both buyer and seller. Applying a condition of sale to
only a segment of the market, as opposed to the whole market (ie "No
shirt, no shoes, no sale" versus "No shirt, no shoes, and your ugly, no
sale") violates all three of the standards necessary for a free market.
Hayek understood something you don't, a business is a public trust. It is
not a pure expression of individual freedom. Why? Because it involves more
than one party.
One has the right to do as you want, UNTIL it effects another. Then they
have a say.
A business market with only one party is no market.

Liberty not only means that the individual has both the opportunity and

his actions. Liberty and responsibility are inseperable.

I am certain that nothing has done so much to destroy the judicial
safeguards of individual freedom as the striving after this mirage of
social justice.

Not with 802.11 anything will it be 'clear across town'. A few hundred
yards w/ 802.11b and maybe a mile with 802.11a. Now if you're talking
directional then it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to ask "Where does
that nifty parabolic point? Why, at that other nifty parabolic. Well,
gentlemen, how's 'bout we take 'em both down?"
If you want distance you'll either have to add an illegal final or else
use packet or some other mechanism (probably illegaly as well).

Travel Warning
United States Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC  20520
November 6, 2001
The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Turkmenistan
at this time.  While the Department of State has authorized the return of
embassy personnel in non-emergency positions and family members of embassy
personnel effective November 6, 2001, the September 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States and the proximity of Turkmenistan to Afghanistan have
raised ongoing concerns for the safety of American citizens in Turkmenistan.
Afghanistan is the site of military operations and continues to harbor
international terrorist Usama bin Laden.  The U.S. Embassy in Ashgabat will
continue to employ heightened security precautions.
All American citizens in Turkmenistan are urged to review their personal
security situations and to take those measures they deem appropriate to
ensure their well-being.  The Government of Turkmenistan has taken steps to
increase security throughout the country.  Nevertheless, the current
situation in the region requires that all Americans in or traveling through
Turkmenistan evaluate carefully the implications for their security and
Americans who decide to remain in or visit Turkmenistan should exercise
caution and take all appropriate measures to ensure their personal safety
and monitor the local news.
U.S. citizens in Turkmenistan are strongly urged to register and obtain
updated security information at the American Embassy in Ashgabat.  The U.S.
Embassy is located at 9 Pushkin Street, off
Maqtymquly Street.  The telephone number is 993-12-35-00-45, fax number
For further general information regardinq travel to Turkmenistan, U.S.
citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet
on Turkmenistan, available via the Internet at This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning of September 19, 2001 and
alerts Americans to ongoing security concerns in Turkmenistan and to the
discontinuation of the authorized (voluntary) departure status of
non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. Embassy personnel.

ONLY with a high gain parabolic. Not with a omni. Further, all it takes to
find the other dish is look down that line of site.
They're cheap cards, less than $100 each. The 802.11a, which are higher
frequency, higher bandwidth came out last month. The AP's are supposed to
hit the street on or right after the 15'th of this month.
I'm going with 802.11a myself. The 'b' stuff seems a tad to kid toyish to

Yes, there is.
The panel antennas I've seen actually used (they are used in motels and

Yagi's might make it to 3-5 miles, no more.
Yep, and illegal as hell if you hook them to a 802.11 anything.

Hello coder,
I've developed a small mailinglistmanager called ciphermail that works
with gnupg to encrypt and pseudo anonymize all communication between the listmembers and ciphermail.
it's not much code (yet) and it's written in perl with crypt::gnupg and
mime::lite, so it needs a cryptographic filesystem for /tmp because of
the created temporary files created by these modules.
There are a bunch of ideas out there what ciphermail should do in the
next release, so we need some help to implement and improve it ;)
Maybe someone has some spare time to commit a patch or two...
i've set up a webpage under

about ciphermail, so maybe you're interessted in.

BEC ON A CHIP.  First it was neutral atoms guided along a wire
(Update 416).  Then it was a beam of atoms steered over the surface
of a microchip (Update 486).  Now the latest feat of atom optics,
performed by a group at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, is the
creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of rubidium atoms in a
microscopic magnetic trap built into a lithographically patterned
chip.  Not only was this the fastest-formed BEC (it took only 700 ms
to form, faster even than the all-optical BEC method reporter earlier
this year see Update 545) but the condensate can be maneuvered
around the microchip a few microns above the surface (see Update
516); in fact the condensate was moved a distance of 1.6 mm.  This
capability opens up the possibility of numerous atomtronic
applications in interferometry, quantum computing, navigation,
lithography, holography, and entanglement experiments.  (Hansel et
al., Nature, 4 October 2001.)

Edge detection and sharpening software is my friend. If it's an object in
the frame, contrast to the entire frame, that is being target then run a
simple edge detector on a blit, find the CG, stack CG in subsequent
frames. Average, sharpen, edge detect, add back into original (ie stack
Another trick, digital cameras use it, is to crop all the frames so that
the 'window' is the 'same' in each frame. Then display the frame as the

QUANTUM FINGERPRINTING.  Imagine two offices, located
halfway around the world, and their headquarters wants to make
sure that they each have the identical copy of a database.  Imagine
further that the databases are huge--10^20 bits each.  They could
transmit the database to the headquarters, and the headquarters
could compare them.  But transmitting 10^20 bits--equal to about
11 billion gigabytes would take an enormous amount of time.
There is a method in which they only need to send 10^10 bits--a
little over a gigabyte--and the headquarters still gets enough
information to determine that they have the exact same database. This method is called "classical fingerprinting."  The idea is that
each office independently, without communicating to each other,
generates a distinctive number, called a fingerprint, by performing
a calculation involving the entire database and locally generated
random numbers, called keys.  The result of the calculation-a
fingerprint of 10^10 bits--is then sent to the headquarters.  Now, a
Dutch-Canadian team (Harry Buhrman, CWI/University of
Amsterdam, 011-31-20-5924076, buhrman at cwi.nl) has suggested
a "quantum fingerprinting" scheme which would involve an
exponentially smaller transmission of information to do the same
job.  For the 10^20 bit database, each office would only have to
transmit a fingerprint of about 70 "quantum bits" (qubits), which
could be, for example, specially prepared photons.  Such photons
could contain the result of a computation between the database and
many different random keys simultaneously, rather than a single
random key.  The researchers say that one could demonstrate this
new fingerprinting technique with quantum computers not much
more complex than the ones that exist today.  Buhrman estimates
that quantum fingerprinting becomes more efficient than classical
fingerprinting in a quantum computer with 5 to 10 qubits.  (H.

EMERGENCY POWERS ALLOW MASS-SURVEILLANCE FOR NON-TERRORIST
*) Home Office undecided whether ISP data retention to be voluntary or
compulsory *) Data revealing who you talk to, what you read, where you are,
collected for "national security"
*) Data can be trawled for public order, minor crimes, tax, health and
*) E-Commerce to bear open-ended storage and data-protection compliance
As part of an emergency package of anti-terrorism measures, Home
Secretary David Blunkett announced yesterday (Note 3) that Internet
Service Providers would be "enabled" to retain logs detailing the online
activity of their customers (but NOT the contents of communications).
Data protection legislation (Note 4) currently protects electronic
privacy by prohibiting blanket storage by ISPs of logs recording such
details as websites browsed, To and From addresses of e-mails, and which
'newsgroup' articles are read by a subscriber. Other "communications
data", such as the telephone number used to dial-up the Internet, may be
kept so long as it is relevant to billing or fraud control.
Although Mr.Blunkett's use of the word "enable" (rather than "require")
implied that compliance will be at the ISP's discretion, the lead
official told FIPR that retention may be made compulsory, enforced
through civil law. The same source said a ministerial certificate will
assert "national security" exemptions (Note 5) so that ISPs and
telephone companies will not be in breach of European Directives. The
government will only specify later exactly what data may be collected
and for how long in a Code of Practice in consultation with ISPs. No new legislation is necessary for police and intelligence agencies to
collect the data once it is recorded by ISPs and telephone companies. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act 2000 (Note 5) allows
records to be obtained for broad purposes including tax, health and
safety, public order offences and minor crime. Although "communications
data" provides a complete map of private life, revealing who you talk
to, what you read, and where you go, the authorities can rubber-stamp
compilation and trawling of large and detailed databases. In contrast,
inspection of the contents of a single e-mail requires a warrant from a
Secretary of State, and a search for documents requires a court order.
Bulk requests can be made on groups or the history of an individual and
kept by police and intelligence agencies indefinitely under data
protection exemptions. This includes the exact co-ordinates of your
geographic location - which 3rd-generation mobiles produce continuously
whilst the phone is switched on.
Computerised 'traffic analysis' (tracing links between individuals) is a
powerful new form of mass-surveillance, but is only efficient at keeping
tabs on the law-abiding. Professional terrorists know how to cover their
tracks - for example throw-away use of pre-paid mobile phones. Reports
of the modus operandi of the September 11th terrorists indicate they
used Web-based e-mail from public terminals. Clearly it is not
persuasive to argue for privacy to be sacrificed in the name of fighting
terrorism if the measures would not in fact be effective.
A leaked report from the National Criminal Intelligence Service last
year revealed that police and security agencies are nevertheless
pressing for a mandatory data retention law to warehouse the traffic
data of the entire population for several years
( Blunkett's proposals amount to
blanket 'dataveillance' for non-terrorist investigations, using the the
tragic events of Sep 11 as justification.
Providers of e-commerce authentication services could be affected as
well as ISPs and telcos. Anyone offering "provision of access to, and of
facilities for making use of...the transmission of communications" [RIP
S.22(4) & S.1 defs] could face extra costs of providing suitable storage
devices and media, and full compliance with data protection legislation.
Caspar Bowden, director of Internet think-tank FIPR (Foundation for
Information Policy Research) commented:
"Sensitive data revealing what you read, where you are, and who you talk
to online could be collected in the name of national security. But
Mr.Blunkett intends to allow access to this data for purposes nothing to
do with fighting terrorism. Minor crimes, public order and tax offences,
attendance at demonstrations, even 'health and safety' will be
legitimate reasons to siphon sensitive details of private life into
government databases to be retained indefinitely. This would be in
flagrant breach of the first and second Data Protection Principles."

The steam in an iron doesn't get anywhere that hot, it'd ruin the clothes.
Also an iron will have steam escaping around the edges (when you hit the
steam button especially) and this has the potential to spread un-heated

This entire view misses the(!) one most important component of Unix's (and
Linux's) success, they were first.
There was NO credible competition. The same thing can be said for Apache
and BIND and many other apps. It isn't that they were the best, they were
simply the first - and get to reap market inertia as a result.
However, and it's a doozy, this won't last. As the Open Source market
expands and takes over pretty much completely you'll see this dominance
begin to decrease.
Why? Because of the component nature of the software.

You're probably wrong on both counts. When the US falls, it will likely be
from internal stress from external (and long running) events. We should
hope that the fall is as bloodless as the one in the CCCP back in very
early 90's. Note that people won't run from the cities, nor will there
likely be mass destruction (unless somebody in 'power' gets hard headed
and retains some sort of control over the military). In the case of the
CCCP not only had the society in general had their fill but so did the
military. The key point to a bloodless fall will be the military saying 'I
think we'll sit this one out, thank you very much.'

Yes, very particularly in fact.
Being 'first' doesn't imply they were 'alone'. You misrepresent reality
to your own end.
What happened is there were a cloud of near-miss OS'es. In the case of
Unix it was the right one becuase of its scale and the mechanism it was
distributed by (it's development process was also out of the ordinary not
being some massive long running committee) and the particular pardigms
that it chose to use. There was a low cost distribution mechanism so
curious people could buy in for a low cost.
The same can be said for Linux, but in that case there were many factors. FSF was around and pushing Hurd but they were looking for somebody else to do
it. Minix and other near-miss kernels had been around for a few years so
its not like Linux poped out of thin air. There was no low cost
distribution mechanism that was popular prior to about '94. It's no
accident that Linux took off at the same time that the Internet in general
took off (about '94).
In both cases it was synergy of issues. The license being a key, but not
singular component (as you would have us believe). Another factor of equal
if not greater import was the cost/ease of actual/physical distribution.

Computers intended for single-user interactive processing. When looking at
cost/performance/feature for the OS'es current in the late 60's none were
really effective (I'm excluding Language-in-ROM machines - not that any of
them were stellar in performance). What would one day become engineering
workstations and personal computers (which are the same thing today).
A new class of machines was coming out (my first machine was a PDP 8e
running BASIC) and while there were plenty of tools they tended to be
vertical in intent or else not general purpose enough for this sort of
computing. Look at the first couple of years of Byte or Dr. Dobb's for
more specific examples (remember Godbout?) in the personal computer
Which happens to be one of the primary reasons Unix was developed, there
were no realistic choices in the market for this paradigm. So a solution
can trotting along.
We're facing the same sort of thing today with respect to 'grid computing'
and such. All the current OS'es (Linux incl.) are focused on the old style
of solutions. We'll also find that our current views of what IP means will
be found to be as antiquated.

@_subject: [psychohistory] Two mistakes (fwd) 
Reply-To: psychohistory at yahoogroups.com
Nations with imperial aspirations, invariably, throughout History change their conscript based army in favor of an army of paid soldiers. Today euphimisticaly called 'profesional' soldiers, but know also as mercenaries and soldiers of fortune in the not-so-distant past. (Note: Ligustically a "soldier" is 'someone-who-is-SOLD' anyway).
Now this trend is well documented in past history and definately has its own Psychohistorical significance as it's one of the notable 'landmarks' of an Imperium (ie. a nation/state pursuing local/regional/global hegemony - dominance).
What I find interesting and relating with the above 'historical' symptom in todays' US history making actions, are two choices made by the current US administration. I call those choices 'mistakes' for a number of reasons. Both can be atributed to the so-called 'Vietnam Syndrom' of the US society, but IMO they go deeper than that, into the effects and side-effects of profesional armies.
The first is choice is a call for minimal US military casualties. OK the general public might have not liked it before 9/11, but in retrospect after 9/11 things look different. Think about it. First In an imaginary situation. Before, but after as well, 9/11 even a 'what's-his-name' journalist could arrange a meeting with Bin Laden should we belive that he eluded the US inteligence? The answer is that they probably knew Bin Laden's location but could not just send 1,000 troops in to get him because of the very real probability of high casualties. Of course profesional soldiers are in for the money and generally do not look forward to a glorious death in Afganistan, but 6,000 civilians died because of this US amy inaction. In retrospect the general public would be far more willing to 'understand' the need of high arny casualties in order to save civilian lives.
Second in today's real situation. The US army is stil reluctant to go in even though their projected casualties are still far less than the 6,000 civilian deat toll. Instead they resort an air campain that cannot distinguise between guilty and inocent, slowly making the US look more and more like the terrorists, at least in the common Afganis' eyes and not only.
6,000 civilians dead and the US military still fights a war without the ability to 'afford' military casualties. That's the combination af a profesional army with the Vietnam Syndrome. Extremely unproductive too, thus, a mistake.
The other choice is that they make this 'War-on-terror' a non-hero war, at a time that heroes are needed.
First here we can note the overlooking of the first heroes, the passengers of Flight 95. They received far less laurels than they deserved - unless the US administration 'knows' something we don't abt. the termination of Flight 95 (Was it shot down by an F-16 or and F-15 fighter?). Firefighters etc. received a heroes treatment for doing their duty, but a hero is someone who does beyond duty, like the passengers of Flight 95.
Then there is the choice to keep the two dead servicemen who died in Pakistan, nameless. The US administration let pass a unique opportunity to make new heroes and show that not only US civilians die in this war, but, this fear for casualties struck again and the two dead Americans do not receive any heroes treatment. OK they were pros, in for the money, not for death 'n glory, but still they could be treated better. Additionaly, I don't think that their comrades haven't noticed that their 'sacrifices' do not weight much. That can and will affect their morale. Angain a mistake.
It is in the best interests of the US and their allies go in and finish what they started. This is a time where the general public will allow for military casualties, but this 'window' will close, sooner than later, and the image of the US will be more damaged than anything else.

@_subject: [9fans] What makes Plan 9 unique? (fwd) 
Reply-To: 9fans at cse.psu.edu
Why Plan 9?
Why Plan 9 indeed.  Isn't Plan 9 just another Unix clone?  Who cares?
First, Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface.  Once
you've settled in, there are very few surprises here, whereas Windows
still surprises me once in a while (though, to its credit, not as much
as older versions did).  After I switched to Linux from Windows 3.1, I
noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior in Windows 3.1 that Linux
did not have.  Switching to Plan 9 from Linux highlighted just as much
in Linux.
One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be.  For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel.  The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.
If Plan 9 were just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth
using, or it might not.  The neat things start happening with
user-level file servers and per-process namespace.  Recall that in
Unix, /dev/tty refers to the current window's output device, and means
different things to different processes.  This is a special hack
enabled by the kernel for a single file.  Plan 9 provides full-blown
per-process namespaces.  Thus, in Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the
current window's output device, and means different things to
different processes, but the window system (or telnet daemon, or ssh
daemon, or whoever) arranges this, and does the same for /dev/mouse,
Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers the
kernel need not know about things like DOS's FAT file system or
Linux's EXT2 file system or NFS, etc.  Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired.  In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.
We need not stop at physical file systems, though.  Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources.  For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox.  This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.
As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track.  If it's a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories creates new audio or
data tracks.  Want to fixate the CD as audio or data?  Remove one of
the directories.
Finally, Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment.  Since files
or directory trees can be imported from other machines, and all
resources are files or directory trees, it's easy to share resources.
Want to use a different machine's sound card?  Import its /dev/audio.
Want to debug processes that run on another machine?  Import its
its /net.  And so on.

@_subject: Why Plan-9? 
An OS without a computer is worthless. What drives the architecture of
OS'es (other than mental mastrubation) is applications and applications
environments. In the very late 60's there was a growth in the
computers::person ratio coupled with a great increase in  as a
whole. This led to a problem of scale and scope. Problems that Unix was
able to resolve in a usable way (as 30 years of use will attest). Most
other OS'es weren't. Not that Unix was the only alternative (eg C/PM).
However, the sorts of problems used in a day to day business/activity
creates a 'natural' schism. That is based around the distinctions between
design/engineering and business-home/industry. Unix found a first home in
the first. The 'smaller' OS'es found homes in the second. Each expanded
into the others realm until today. Whence we have several set of originaly
niche market solutions. These solutions have now saturated the market.
However, there are forces that are changing the market radicaly. Moving
from a real 'network is the computer' model. The reality is that the four
horsemen of the network (software, hardware, infrastructure, law) are
going to be replaced in the next 5 or so years with an almost completely
different model. These differences will serve to amplify the current
stresses and schisms in our societies.

That's not entirely correct. In fact there are examples of dedicated lines
being used for wireless interconnectivity to bypass the traditional
network. The 802.11b are worthless for anything but playing around with,
but the 802.11a that just came out has sufficient bandwidth and range to

I'm also willing to run a companion web site with an archive and a
copy of advogato if people are interested in that.
I proposed once before that mlm software be put in place so that
coderpunks would only accept PGP signed messages from subscribers
and messages from anonymous remailers.  I'm still interested in
working cryptography into the mlm that the list runs on at some
time, although not in the immediate future.
I have benefited greatly from technical discussion lists on
cryptography implementation while working on my own projects.
I'm about to start working rather heavily in PKI and would
like to enjoy the benefits I saw from coderpunks and other
technical forms continued and expanded.
If no one objects, let's move ahead with this.  I've been thinking
of unsubscribing myself from coderpunks because of all the spam.
I intend to run the lists from my personal web site, cryptnet.net,
which has T1 bandwidth (burstable to more than) and runs on a
linux machine running sendmail which has adequate process power
to deliver mail in a reasonable amount of time to > 1000 people.

Ah, here is the double standard in your argument.
And what about the businesses that were used to support those British
soldiers. Would they have been legitimate targets (which they were to
the colonials)? In a parallel way the WTC is the business that supports
the oppressive forces, or at least that's the way they see it. Then of
course we can discuss the entire concept of 'property ownership',
'breaking contract' and 'repress colonials'.
This brings up the aspect of 'self determination' that folks like yourself
seem to be missing. Go read the first two para's of the DoI. Then reflect
on this;
The legitimate use of self-defence with respect to self-determination is
from the view of the oppressed. No consideration is made for those who one
fights against to end the oppression. Freedom is about the individual and
what they are justified in doing if provoked.
Now look at world politics since the 1850's...then consider certain
rejoinders by the founding fathers about getting involved in other peoples
business...then consider rampant globalization w/ centralized political
and military authority...
Further, you wish to us to view the WTC as a isolated senseless event,
when in fact it is not. It is only one more act in a 140 year refutation
of American Democracy.
We reap what we sow.

ntsecapi-dev at lists.dcerpc.net
i'm starting an nt security api.
it will basically be a generic wrapper around
and merge of:
cli_pipe_ntlmssp.c, srv_pipe_ntlmssp.c,
cli_pipe_netsec.c, srv_pipe_netsec.c,
and supporting code.
[see  cvs instructions,
the above files are in source/rpc_client and
the idea is, however, to provide a client/server
framework for general user authentication, signing
and sealing.
once this framework is written, it will be a heck
of a lot simpler to add new user auth / dce/rpc
crypto methods: i will investigate, for example,
porting the kerberos5 auth used in dce 1.22 to
the api, which will allow freedce to do kerberos5
authentication (something it can't do at the moment
because noone's added it)
the api is to be written as a stand-alone library
into which it will need to even be passed memory
allocation and debug handling functions: it will therefore
have practical applications *outside* of samba, dce/rpc
etc. etc., be threadsafe etc. etc.
i'm currently munging the ntlmssp code as the first
working example.
if anyone is interested in helping, please
subscribe to ntsecapi-dev on and we'll continue the discussions there.

I hear the flapping of angels wings...
Only the jury can decide what is right/wrong. Only 'the poeple' have that
right in this country under the Constitution. All criminal proceedings
should be jury trials. Period, no exceptions. The moral obligations
outweigh the increased cost of operations (lack of moral recognition is
another lack of C-A-C-L theory). Once the jury decides then it should be
final. Note the first sentence in Amendment 7...'preserved'...

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous

the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be

shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy

In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty

Unfortunately this isn't the answer either. Common Carrier status brings
with it a whole host of regulatory issues.
A far stronger position is to stand on the 1st as a 'speech' and 'press'
issue. That one you can win without ending up with a monkey on your back.

Actually it isn't Godel's (which just says some statements can't be found

@_author: Jim Choate 
@_subject: [psychohistory] What can a Society Do? 
???? That sentence is without meaning as worded.
But that's exactly(!) why Arrow's applies. Fairness (ie democratic) as
individual choice (ie vote).
The fact that there are no democratic (ie fair) mechanisms by which to
make selections is what damns Crypt-Anarchic-Capitalist-Libertarian (CACL)
thought. A good example is to apply voting theory to David Friedmans law
by contract examples.
One can cast CACL thought as democratic thought except for a single
difference. Democratic thought requires all to be responsible to the same
set of rules and policies. CACL doesn't.
CACL thought has three fundamental flaws. One, it requires individuals to
behave in a manner inconsistent with their biology. People ain't rational
in any sort of consistent manner. Second, it says that if we get rid of
government people will resolve their own problems. However, this statement
can be turned into a 'democratic election' (ie the participants have their
own choices to make - a vote) yet we can prove mathematically that such a
solution is impossible if there are more than two (2) participants. Now I
don't know about you but anything worthy of the label 'society' must have
more than two (2) people involved. Finaly, it assumes that all issues and
decisions one makes in life can be reduced to 'economic' decisions. While
that is certainly possible it is clear that not all issues are deal with
equitably in such a manner.
(It's also applicable to Tim May's commentary a while back about the
'solved n-division' problem (which can also be shown to be a vote if the
remainder is indivisible or can't be re-connected) and the fact that he
seems to think that the solution that is out there now is universal. When
in fact it applies to such a small fraction of n-division problems as to
be worthless. The proof is in the 'remainder' and it's characteristics.
Most of reality doesn't comply with the requirements for 'fair
divisibility' - too granular.)
But a social system isn't (just) a 'system of rules'. It also has beliefs
and various cause-effect and dependency issues related to environment and
biology that cause Godel's to be inapplicable. The fact that it consists
of anything(!) more than a system of rules is enough to invalidate
Godel's. Godel's simply isn't applicable to a broad enough set of
examples. Though Godel's may keep you from proving it). The reality is
that the concept of 'social system' is entirely too broad for the conept
of 'self-consistent language' to be applied. Where did the requirement for
'consistency' in a social setting come from in the first place? And what
does 'consistency' actually mean in that context? A naive interpretation
might be that they always make decisions the same way or perhaps the same
selection. Either will fail because it won't respond to changes in the
environment. Clearly in conflict with the premise of being 'consistent'.

@_subject: The tragedy in NYC (fwd) 
[I sent this originally yesterday, but the, er, problems our mail
server in downtown New York suffered for a while caused some
delay. Another copy was published on Dave Farber's interesting
people. Several people wrote me afterwards vilifying me. Ah well.
The list is now running on a new machine in Virginia, which
should be safe even as more buildings collapse and burn.  --Perry]
In the wake of the tragedy in NYC today, I was asked by someone if I
didn't now agree that crypto was a munition. At the time, I thought
that a friend of mine was likely dead. (I've since learned he escaped
in time.)
My answer then, when I thought I'd lost a friend, was the same as my
answer now and the answer I've always had.
Cryptography must remain freely available to all.
In coming months, politicians will flail about looking for freedoms to
eliminate to "curb the terrorist threat". They will see an opportunity
to grandstand and enhance their careers, an opportunity to show they
are "tough on terrorists".
We must remember throughout that you cannot preserve freedom by
eliminating it. The problem is not a lack of laws banning things.
I know the pressure on everyone in Washington will be to "do
something". Speaking as a New Yorker who dearly loves this city, who
has felt deep shock throughout most of the day, watching the smoke
still rising from the fires to the south of me, listening to the
ambulances and police cars continuing to wail about me, let me say
this:    I do not want more laws passed in the name of defending my home.
   I do not want more freedoms eliminated to "preserve freedom".
   I do not want to trade my freedom for safety. Franklin has said far
   more eloquently than me why that is worthless.
If you must do something, send out more investigators to find those
responsible for this and bring them to justice. Pass no new laws. Take
away no freedoms. Do not destroy the reason I live here to give me
"safety". I'd rather die in a terrorist attack.

Considering your logic so far, this doesn't surprise me.
Exactly, and you ASSUMED A PRIORI that I would accept your definitions
without stipulation.
Since you're the representative of the 'government' and are making the
prooposal it is standard practice that the 'opposition' get to question
the definitions for relevency.
I did, you lost. Your definition of 'war' and 'terrorism' are inaccurate.
The claim that there is some 'legal definition' that prevents 'nations' or
'states' from participating in 'terrorism' is inaccurate. Even the US
(whose laws I'm ASSUMING you're are refering to) recognizes 'state
sponsored terrorism'.
In short the very pillars of your argument have been demonstrated to be
false. Your argument failed.
In responce you're not ingaging in straw man and ad hominim hoping that
nobody will notice.
Come back when you can play with adults.

@_subject: Please make stable NON-US homes for strong crypto projects (fwd) 
It's clear that the US administration is putting out feelers to
again ban publication of strong encryption.  See:
  The evil gnomes who keep advancing unconstitutional US anti-crypto
policies know that the current hysteria in Congress and the
Administration will not last forever.  So they will probably move very
quickly -- within a week is my guess -- to re-control encryption,
either by a unilateral action of the Administration (by amending
the Export Administration Regulations), or by stuffing a rider onto
some so-called "emergency" bill in Congress.
They maneuvered very carefully in the Bernstein case such that there
is no outstanding injunction against violating the Constitution this
way -- and even no binding 9th-Circuit precedent that tells them it's
unconstitutional to do so.  They know in their hearts that numerous
judges have found it unconstitutional, but they have proven throughout
the seven-year history of the case that they don't give a damn about
the Constitution.  Which means it may take weeks, months or years for
civil liberties workers to get a judge to roll back any such action.
Not just days.  We won the case, but they squirmed out of any
permanent restrictions -- so far.
The US government has a new mania for wiretapping everyone in case
they might be a terrorist.  There's already two bills in Congress to
make it trivial for them to wiretap anybody on flimsy excuses, and to
retroactively justify their precipitous act of rolling Carnivore boxes
into major ISPs this week and demanding, without legal authority, that
they be put at the heart of the networks.  See:
  Even more than before, we will need good encryption tools, merely to
maintain privacy for law-abiding citizens, political activists, and
human rights workers.  (In the current hysteria, mere messages
advocating peace or Constitutional rights might best be encrypted.)
The European Parliament also recently recommended that European
communications be routinely encrypted to protect them from pervasive
US Echelon wiretaps.
Some US developers, who thought such a reversal would never happen,
have built or maintained a number of good open source encryption tools
in the United States, and may not have lined up solid foreign
maintainers or home sites.
LET'S FIX THAT!  We need volunteers in many countries to mirror
current distributions, CVS trees, etc.  We need volunteers to also
act as maintainers, accepting patches and integrating them into
solid releases.
(Note that too many countries have pledged to stand toe-to-toe with the
US while they march off to make war on somebody they can't figure out
who it is yet.  If you live in one of those countries, you may
suddenly find that your own crypto regs have been sneakily altered.
Take care that each useful package has maintainers and distribution
points in diverse countries.)
I haven't kept close track of which packages are in danger.  I
suggest that people nominate packages on this mailing list, and that
others immediately grab mirror copies of them as they are nominated.
And that some of those who mirror them keep quiet, in case hysterical
governments make a concerted effort to stamp out all copies and/or all
major distribution sites.  If you aren't the quiet type, then *AFTER*
IMMEDIATELY PULLING A COPY OF THE CODE OUTSIDE US JURISDICTION,
announce your mirror on this mailing list.
We freedom-loving US citizens have had to rely on the freedom-loving
citizens of saner countries, to do the work of making strong
encryption, for many years.  We had a brief respite, which we will
eventually resume for good.  In the meantime, please let me apologize
for my countrymen and for my government, for asking you to shoulder
most of the burden again.  Thank you so much.

that they lobby like hell to keep privacy and integrity legal in the US.

People, most people, will do whatever the hell they feel justified in
doing. Concepts like 'good' or 'evil' are the fundamental failing of your argument. They are not universal.

They people engaging in them certainly felt justified. Whether you agree
or not is really a different question. It also demonstrates the
relativity of 'good' and 'evil'.
If we were for a moment to accept the concept of 'universal evil' then we
are faced with a simple litmus test. If it is really universal than a
rock, rabbit, or person will find it equally offensive.
Or are you perhaps suggesting that people are somehow 'universal' (ie

Not at all, That's only one example. Unfortunately it isn't sufficient for
your point, the economics weren't the PRIMARY goal as your stipulation
requires. Primary mechanism <> primary goal.
Further, to be absolutely accurate, your commentary 'begs the question'.
A bank robber is not a terrorist.
A terrorist may be a bank robber (as many have been, eg. SLA).
It's not I who is not thinking broadly enough.

Special Report
Osama Bin Laden: How the U.S.
Helped Midwife a Terrorist Ahmed Rashid of Pakistan is a member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the Center for Public Integrity. He is the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review and The Daily Telegraph of London. This is an excerpt from his book "Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia" (Yale University Press).
By Ahmed Rashid
In 1986, CIA chief William Casey had stepped up the war against the Soviet Union by taking three significant, but at that time highly secret, measures.
He had persuaded the US Congress to provide the Mujaheddin with American-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Soviet planes and provide US advisers to train the guerrillas. Until then, no US-made weapons or personnel had been used directly in the war effort.
 The CIA, Britain's MI6 and the ISI [Pakistanï¿½s Inter-Services Intelligence] also agreed on a provocative plan to launch guerrilla attacks into the Soviet Socialist Republics of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the soft Muslim underbelly of the Soviet state from where Soviet troops in Afghanistan received their supplies. The task was given to the ISI's favourite Mujaheddin leader, Gulbuddin Hikmetyar. In March 1987, small units crossed the Amu Darya river from bases in northern Afghanistan and launched their first rocket attacks against villages in Tajikistan. Casey was delighted with the news, and on his next secret trip to Pakistan he crossed the border into Afghanistan with [the late Pakistani] President Zia [ul-Haq] to review the Mujaheddin groups. Thirdly, Casey committed CIA support to a long-standing ISI initiative to recruit radical Muslims from around the world to come to Pakistan and fight with the Afghan Mujaheddin. The ISI had encouraged this since 1982, and by now all the other players had their reasons for supporting the idea. President Zia aimed to cement Islamic unity, turn Pakistan into the leader of the Muslim world and foster an Islamic opposition in Central Asia. Washington wanted to demonstrate that the entire Muslim world was fighting the Soviet Union alongside the Afghans and their American benefactors. And the Saudis saw an opportunity both to promote Wahabbism [their strict and austere Wahabbi creed] and to get rid of its disgruntled radicals. None of the players reckoned on these volunteers having their own agendas, which would eventually turn their hatred against the Soviets on their own regimes and the Americans. Thousands of radicals come to study  . . Between 1982 and 1992, some 35,000 Muslim radicals from 43 Islamic countries in the Middle East, North and East Africa, Central Asia and the Far East would pass their baptism under fire with the Afghan Mujaheddin. Tens of thousands more foreign Muslim radicals came to study in the hundreds of new madrassas that Zia's military government began to fund in Pakistan and along the Afghan border. Eventually more than 100,000 Muslim radicals were to have direct contact with Pakistan and Afghanistan and be influenced by the jihad.  In camps near Peshawar and in Afghanistan, these radicals met each other for the first time and studied, trained and fought together. It was the first opportunity for most of them to learn about Islamic movements in other countries, and they forged tactical and ideological links that would serve them well in the future. The camps became virtual universities for future Islamic radicalism. None of the intelligence agencies involved wanted to consider the consequences of bringing together thousands of Islamic radicals from all over the world. "What was more important in the world view of history? The Taliban or the fall of the Soviet Empire? A few stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?" said Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former US National Security Adviser. American citizens woke up to the consequences only when Afghanistan-trained Islamic militants blew up the World Trade Center in New York in 1993, killing six people and injuring 1,000. "The war," wrote Samuel Huntington, "left behind an uneasy coalition of Islamist organizations intent on promoting Islam against all non-Muslim forces. It also left a legacy of expert and experienced fighters, training camps and logistical facilities, elaborate trans-Islam networks of personal and organization relationships, a substantial amount of military equipment including 300 to 500 unaccounted-for Stinger missiles, and, most important, a heady sense of power and self-confidence over what had been achieved and a driving desire to move on to other victories." A young Bin Laden  . . Among these thousands of foreign recruits was a young Saudi student, Osama Bin Laden, the son of a Yemeni construction magnate, Mohammed Bin Laden, who was a close friend of the late King Faisal and whose company had become fabulously wealthy on the contracts to renovate and expand the Holy Mosques of Mecca and Medina. The ISI had long wanted Prince Turki Bin Faisal, the head of Istakhbarat, the Saudi Intelligence Service, to provide a Royal Prince to lead the Saudi contingent in order to show Muslims the commitment of the Royal Family to the jihad. Only poorer Saudis, students, taxi drivers and Bedouin tribesmen had so far arrived to fight. But no pampered Saudi prince was ready to rough it out in the Afghan mountains. Bin Laden, although not a royal, was close enough to the royals and certainly wealthy enough to lead the Saudi contingent Bin Laden, Prince Turki and General Gut were to become firm friends and allies in a common cause.  The centre for the Arab-Afghans  [Filipino Moros, Uzbeks from Soviet Central Asia, Arabs from Algeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Uighurs from Xinjiang in China who had all come to fight with the Mujaheddin] was the offices of the World Muslim League and the Muslim Brotherhood in the northern Pakistan city of Peshawar. The center was run by Abdullah Azam, a Jordanian Palestinian whom Bin Laden had first met at university in Jeddah and revered as his leader. Azam and his two sons were assassinated by a bomb blast in Peshawar in 1989. During the 1980s, Azam had forged close links with Hikmetyar and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the Afghan Islamic scholar, whom the Saudis had sent to Peshawar to promote Wahabbism. Saudi funds flowed to Azam and the Makhtab at Khidmat or Services Center, which he created in 1984 to service the new recruits and receive donations from Islamic charities. Donations from Saudi Intelligence, the Saudi Red Crescent, the World Muslim League and private donations from Saudi princes and mosques were channelled through the Makhtab. A decade later, the Makhtab would emerge at the center of a web of radical organizations that helped carry out the World Trade Center bombing and the bombings of US embassies in Africa in 1998. Until he arrived in Afghanistan, Bin Laden's life had hardly been marked by anything extraordinary. He was born around 1957, the 17th of 57 children sired by his Yemeni father and a Saudi mother, one of Mohammed Bin Laden's many wives. Bin Laden studied for a masterï¿½s degree in business administration at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah but soon switched to Islamic studies. Thin and tall, he is 6 feet 5 inches, with long limbs and a flowing beard. He towered above his contemporaries, who remember him as a quiet and pious individual but hardly marked out for greater things. His father backed the Afghan struggle and helped fund it, so when Bin Laden decided to join up, his family responded enthusiastically. He first traveled to Peshawar in 1980 and met the Mujaheddin leaders, returning frequently with Saudi donations for the cause until 1982, when he decided to settle in Peshawar. He brought in his company engineers and heavy construction equipment to help build roads and depots for the Mujaheddin. In 1986, he helped build the Khost tunnel complex, which the CIA was funding as a major arms storage depot, training facility and medical center for the Mujaheddin, deep under the mountains close to the Pakistan border. For the first time in Khost he set up his own training camp for Arab Afghans, who now increasingly saw this lanky, wealthy and charismatic Saudi as their leader.  . . Bin Laden later claimed to have taken part in ambushes against Soviet troops, but he mainly used his wealth and Saudi donations to build Mujaheddin projects and spread Wahabbism among the Afghans. After the death of Azam in 1989, he took over Azam's organization and set up Al Qaeda or Military Base as a service center for Arab-Afghans and their families and to forge a broad-based alliance among them. With the help of Bin Laden, several thousand Arab militants had established bases in the provinces of Kunar, Nuristan and Badakhshan, but their extreme Wahabbi practices made them intensely disliked by the majority of Afghans. Moreover, by allying themselves with the most extreme pro-Wahabbi Pashtun MuMeddin, the Arab-Afghans alienated the non-Pashtuns and the Shia Muslims. Upset by U.S. role in Gulf War  . . By 1990, Bin Laden was disillusioned by the internal bickering of the Mujaheddin and he returned to Saudi Arabia to work in the family business. He founded a welfare organization for Arab-Afghan veterans. Some 4,000 of them had settled in Mecca and Medina alone, and Bin Laden gave money to the families of those killed. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait he lobbied the Royal Family to organize a popular defense of the kingdom and raise a force from the Afghan war veterans to fight Iraq. Instead, King Fahd invited in the Americans. This came as an enormous shock to Bin Laden. As the 540,000 US troops began to arrive, Bin Laden openly criticized the Royal Family, lobbying the Saudi ulema to issue fatwas, religious rulings, against non-Muslims being based in the country.  . . In 1992, Bin Laden left for Sudan to take part in the Islamic revolution under way there under the charismatic Sudanese leader Hassan Turabi. Bin Laden's continued criticism of the Saudi Royal Family eventually annoyed them so much that they took the unprecedented step of revoking his citizenship in 1994. It was in Sudan, with his wealth and contacts, that Bin Laden gathered around him more veterans of the Afghan war, who were all disgusted by the American victory over Iraq and the attitude of the Arab ruling elites who allowed the US military to remain in the Gulf. As US and Saudi pressure mounted against Sudan for harboring Bin Laden, the Sudanese authorities asked him to leave. In May 1996, Bin Laden travelled back to Afghanistan, arriving in Jalalabad in a chartered jet with an entourage of dozens of Arab militants, bodyguards and family members, including three wives and 13 children. Here he lived under the protection of the Jalalabad Shura [an advisory body or assembly], until the conquest of Kabul and Jalalabad by the Taliban in September 1996. In August 1996, he had issued his first declaration of jihad against the Americans, whom he said were occupying Saudi Arabia. "The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets," the declaration read. Striking up a friendship with Mullah Omar, in 1997 he moved to Kandahar, Afghanistan, and came under the protection of the Taliban. By now, the CIA had set up a special cell to monitor his activities and his links with other Islamic militants. A US State Department report in August 1996 noted that Bin Laden was "one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world." The report said that Bin Laden was financing terrorist camps in Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Egypt and Afghanistan. In April 1996, President Clinton signed the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allowed the US to block assets of terrorist organizations. It was first used to block Bin Laden's access to his fortune of an estimated US$250-300 million. A few months later, Egyptian intelligence declared that Bin Laden was training 1,000 militants, a second generation of Arab-Afghans, to bring about an Islamic revolution in Arab countries. CIA tries snatch operation In early 1997, the CIA constituted a squad that arrived in Peshawar to try to carry out a snatch operation to get Bin Laden out of Afghanistan. The Americans enlisted Afghans and Pakistanis to help them but aborted the operation. The US activity in Peshawar helped persuade Bin Laden to move to the safer confines of Kandahar. On  23 February 1998, at a meeting in the original Khost camp, all the groups associated with Al Qaeda issued a manifesto under the aegis of "The International Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders." The manifesto stated "for more than seven years the US has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian peninsular, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbours, and turning its bases in the peninsular into a spearhead through which to fight the neighbouring Muslim peoples." The meeting issued a fatwa. "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies -- civilians and military -- is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to." Bin Laden had now formulated a policy that was not just aimed at the Saudi Royal Family or the Americans, but called for the liberation of the entire Muslim Middle East. As the American air war against Iraq escalated in 1998, Bin Laden called on all Muslims to "confront, fight and kill, Americans and Britons." 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings However, it was the bombings in August 1998 of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 220 people which made Bin Laden a household name in the Muslim world and the West. Just 13 days later, after accusing Bin Laden of perpetrating the attack, the USA retaliated by firing 70 cruise missiles against Bin Laden's camps around Khost and Jalalabad. Several camps which had been handed over by the Taliban to the Arab-Afghans and Pakistani radical groups were hit. The Al Badr camp controlled by Bin Laden and the Khalid bin Walid and Muawia camps run by the Pakistani Harakat ul Ansar were the main targets. Harakat used their camps to train militants for fighting Indian troops in Kashmir. Seven outsiders were killed in the strike -- three Yemenis, two Egyptians, one Saudi and one Turk. Also killed were seven Pakistanis and 20 Afghans. In November 1998 the USA offered a US$5-million reward for Bin Laden's capture. The Americans were further galvanized when Bin Laden claimed that it was his Islamic duty to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons to use against the USA. "It would be a sin for Muslims not to try to possess the weapons that would prevent infidels from inflicting harm on Muslims. Hostility toward America is a religious duty and we hope to be rewarded for it by God," he said.  . . After the Africa bombings, the US launched a truly global operation. More than 80 Islamic militants were arrested in a dozen different countries. Militants were picked up in a crescent running from Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan and Yemen to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and the Phillipines." In December 1998, Indian authorities detained Bangladeshi militants for plotting to bomb the US Consulate in Calcutta. Seven Afghan nationals using false Italian passports were arrested in Malaysia and accused of trying to start a bombing campaign." According to the FBI, militants in Yemen who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in December 1998 were funded by Bin Laden. In February 1999, Bangladeshi authorities said Bin Laden had sent US$l million to the Harkat-ul-Jihad (HJ) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, some of whose members had trained and fought in Afghanistan. HJ leaders said they wanted to turn Bangladesh into a Taliban-style Islamic state. Thousands of miles away in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania in West Africa, several militants were arrested who had also trained under Bin Laden in Afghanistan and were suspected of plotting bomb explosions. Meanwhile, during the trial of 107 Al-Jihad members at a military court in Cairo, Egyptian intelligence officers testified that Bin Laden had bankrolled Al-Jihad. In February 1999, the CIA claimed that through monitoring Bin Laden's communication network by satellite, they had prevented his supporters from carrying out seven bomb attacks against US overseas facilities in Saudi Arabia, Albania, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Uganda, Uruguay and the Ivory Coast -- emphasizing the reach of the Afghan veterans.   . . But it was Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the original sponsors of the Arab-Afghans, who suffered the most as their activities rebounded. In March 1997, three Arab and two Tajik militants [from Tajikistan] were shot dead after a 36-hour gun battle between them and the police in an Afghan refugee camp near Peshawar. Belonging to the Wahabbi radical Tafkir group, they were planning to bomb an Islamic heads of state meeting in Islamabad. Fighting in Kashmir against India With the encouragement of Pakistan, the Taliban and Bin Laden, Arab-Afghans had enlisted in the Pakistani party Harkat-ut-Ansar to fight in Kashmir against Indian troops. By inducting Arabs who introduced Wahabbi-style rules in the Kashmir valley, genuine Kashmiri militants felt insulted. The US government had declared Ansar a terrorist organization in 1996 and it had subsequently changed its name to Harkat-ul-Mujaheddin. All the Pakistani victims of the US missile strikes on Khost belonged to Ansar. In 1999, Ansar said it would impose a strict Wahabbi-style dress code in the Kashmir valley and banned jeans and jackets. On 15 February 1999, they shot and wounded three Kashmiri cable television operators for relaying Western satellite broadcasts. Ansar had previously respected the liberal traditions of Kashmiri Muslims, but the activities of the Arab-Afghans hurt the legitimacy of the Kashmiri movement and gave India a propaganda coup. Pakistan faced a problem when Washington urged Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to help arrest Bin Laden. The ISI's close contacts with Bin Laden, and the fact that he was helping fund and train Kashmiri militants who were using the Khost camps, created a dilemma for Sharif when he visited Washington in December 1998. Sharif sidestepped the issue but other Pakistani officials were more brazen, reminding their American counterparts how they had both helped midwife Bin Laden in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. Bin Laden himself pointed to continued support from some elements in the Pakistani intelligence services in an interview. "As for Pakistan there are some governmental departments, which, by the Grace of God, respond to the Islamic sentiments of the masses in Pakistan. This is reflected in sympathy and co-operation. However, some other governmental departments fell into the trap of the infidels. We pray to God to return them to the right path," said Bin Laden. Conundrums for Pakistan, Saudi Arabia Support for Bin Laden by elements within the Pakistani establishment was another contradiction in Pakistanï¿½s Afghan policy. . . . The US was Pakistanï¿½s closest ally, with deep links to the military and the ISI. But both the Taliban and Bin Laden provided sanctuary and training facilities for Kashmiri militants who were backed by Pakistan, and Islamabad had little interest in drying up that support. Even though the Americans repeatedly tried to persuade the ISI to cooperate in delivering Bin Laden, the ISI declined, although it did help the US arrest several of Bin Laden's supporters. Without Pakistanï¿½s support, the United States could not hope to launch a snatch by US commandos or more accurate bombing strikes, because it needed Pakistani territory to launch such raids. At the same time, the USA dared not expose Pakistanï¿½s support for the Taliban, because it still hoped for ISI cooperation in catching Bin Laden. The Saudi conundrum was even worse. In July 1998 Prince Turki had visited Kandahar and a few weeks later 400 new pick-up trucks arrived in Kandahar for the Taliban, still bearing their Dubai license plates. The Saudis also gave cash for the Taliban's cheque book conquest of the north in the autumn. Until the Africa bombings and despite US pressure to end their support for the Taliban, the Saudis continued funding the Taliban and were silent on the need to extradite Bin Laden. The truth about the Saudi silence was even more complicated. The Saudis preferred to leave Bin Laden alone in Afghanistan because his arrest and trial by the Americans could expose the deep relationship that Bin Laden continued to have with sympathetic members of the Royal Family and elements within Saudi intelligence, which could prove deeply embarrassing. The Saudis wanted Bin Laden either dead or a captive of the Taliban -- they did not want him captured by the Americans.  . . By now Bin Laden had developed considerable influence with the Taliban, but that had not always been the case. The Taliban's contact with the Arab-Afghans and their Pan-Islamic ideology was non-existent until the Taliban captured Kabul in 1996. Pakistan was closely involved in introducing Bin Laden to the Taliban leaders in Kandahar, because it wanted to retain the Khost training camps for Kashmiri militants, which were now in Taliban hands. Persuasion by Pakistan, the Taliban's better-educated cadres, who also had Pan-Islamic ideas, and the lure of financial benefits from Bin Laden, encouraged the Taliban leaders to meet with Bin Laden and hand him back the Khost camps. A life with the Taliban in Kandahar Partly for his own safety and partly to keep control over him, the Taliban shifted Bin Laden to Kandahar in 1997. At first he lived as a paying guest. He built a house for Mullah Omar's family and provided funds to other Taliban leaders. He promised to pave the road from Kandahar airport to the city and build mosques, schools and dams, but his civic works never got started as his funds were frozen. While Bin Laden lived in enormous style in a huge mansion in Kandahar with his family, servants and fellow militants, the arrogant behaviour of the Arab-Afghans who arrived with him and their failure to fulfill any of their civic projects antagonized the local population. The Kandaharis saw the Taliban leaders as beneficiaries of Arab largesse rather than the people. Bin Laden endeared himself further to the leadership by sending several hundred Arab-Afghans to participate in the 1997 and 1998 Taliban offensives in the north. These Wahabbi fighters helped the Taliban carry out massacres of the Shia Hazaras in the north. Several hundred Arab-Afghans, based in the Rishkor army garrison outside Kabul, fought on the Kabul front against [the Mujaheddin leader Ahmad Shah] Masud. Increasingly, Bin Laden's world view appeared to dominate the thinking of senior Taliban leaders. All-night conversations between Bin Laden and the Taliban leaders paid off. Until his arrival, the Taliban leadership had not been particularly antagonistic to the USA or the West but demanded recognition for their government. However, after the Africa bombings the Taliban became increasingly vociferous against the Americans, the UN, the Saudis and Muslim regimes around the world. Their statements increasingly reflected the language of defiance Bin Laden had adopted and wh!
h was not an original Taliban tr
ait. As US pressure on the Taliban to expel Bin Laden intensified, the Taliban said he was a guest and it was against Afghan tradition to expel guests. When it appeared that Washington was planning another military strike against Bin Laden, the Taliban tried to cut a deal with Washington -- to allow him to leave the country in exchange for US recognition. Thus, until the winter of 1998 the Taliban saw Bin Laden as an asset, a bargaining chip over whom they could negotiate with the Americans. The US State Department opened a satellite telephone connection to speak to Mullah Omar directly. The Afghanistan desk officers, helped by a Pushto translator, held lengthy conversations with Omar in which both sides explored various options, but to no avail. By early 1999 it began to dawn on the Taliban that no compromise with the US was possible and they began to see Bin Laden as a liability. A US deadline in February 1999 to the Tatiban to either hand over Bin Laden or face the consequences forced the Taliban to make him disappear discreetly from Kandahar. The move bought the Taliban some time, but the issue was still nowhere near being resolved. The Arab-Afghans had come full circle. From being mere appendages to the Afghan jihad and the Cold War in the 1980s they had taken centre stage for the Afghans, neighbouring countries and the West in the 1990s. . .  Afghanistan was now truly a haven for Islamic internationalism and terrorism and the Americans and the West were at a loss as to how to handle it.

As far as I heard from the news (who knows how
much news meet reality...) the CIA and NSA could
not find a real correlation between the terrorists
and Bin Laden (or at least they couldn't within the
first days after).
German news magazine DER SPIEGEL (current issue, p. 27)
reports, that the german intelligence service BND
(Bundesnachrichtendienst) did find that link.
Usually wiretapping people of Bin Laden's organization is
found as good as useless, because these people keep
strict discipline when using phones. In contrast to that,
some of them dropped discipline after the attacks.
They did jubilate and strut with their attacks. This
was wiretapped by BND and forwarded to the US. The BND asked the US to keep this absolutely secret, because
the BND hoped to catch more of these phone calls and
thus more information, what obviously
wouldn't work if it got publicly known.
US senator Orrin Hatch is said to have publicly revealed
this wiretapping success, thus sealing this source of

an intelligence service in general, if

@_subject: chip-level randomness?  (fwd) 
gnu at toad.com, tytso at mit.edu
The real-RNG in the Intel chip generates something like 75 kbits/sec
of processed random bits.  These are merely wasted if nobody reads them
before it generates 75kbits more in the next second.
I suggest that if application programs don't read all of these bits
out of /dev/intel-rng (or whatever it's called), and the kernel
driver should feed some of the excess random bits into the /dev/random
pool periodically.  When and how it siphons off bits from the RNG is a
separate issue; but can we agree that feeding otherwise-wasted bits
into a depleted /dev/random would be a good idea?
A better way to structure this might be for /dev/intel-rng to register
with /dev/random as a source of entropy that /dev/random can call upon
if it depletes its pool.  /dev/random would then be making decisions
about when to stir more entropy into the pool (either in response to a
read on /dev/random, or to "read ahead" to increase the available pool
in between such reads).  Thus, when demand on /dev/random is high, it
would become one of the "application programs" that would compete to
read from /dev/intel-rng.  Since /dev/random is the defined interface
for arbitrary applications to get unpredictable bits out of the
kernel, I would expect that in general, /dev/random is likely to be
the MAJOR consumer of /dev/intel-rng bits.
(Linux IPSEC uses /dev/random or /dev/urandom for keying material.  It
can easily consume many thousands of random bits per second in doing
IKE's Diffie-Hellman to set up dozens of tunnels.  Today this "surge
demand" occurs at boot time when setting up preconfigured tunnels -- a
particularly bad time since the system hasn't been collecting entropy
for very long.  /dev/intel-rng's high-spead stream can significantly
improve the quality of this keying material, by replenishing the entropy
pool almost as fast IPSEC consumes it.  Over time, IPSEC's
long-term demand for random bits will increase, since opportunistic
encryption allows many more tunnels to be created, with much less
effort per tunnel by the system administrator.)
Also, the PRNG in /dev/random and /dev/urandom may someday be broken
by analytical techniques.  The more diverse sources of true or
apparent randomness that we can feed into it, the less likely it is
that a successful theoretical attack on the PRNG will be practically
successful.  If even a single entropy source of sufficiently high
speed is feeding it, even a compromised PRNG may well be unbreakable.

Reply-To: psychohistory at yahoogroups.com
Terror Attacks: A Psychohistorical view
By Christos Z. Konstas
A first word:
I feel that enough days have passed since the bombing and now we can look
upon the events in a more cool-headed manner.
It is still difficult to address the issue of the recent terrorist attacks
in the USA, but some things need to be said -and discussed - before the
situation deteriorate more.
Every crime, why, every action in our world, needs three factors in order to
take place:
1. The opportunity
2. The means, and behind them all,
3. The motives
The recent criminal terrorist attacks are no exception to this. Before the
execution of the acts these three factors where already in place and in
order to understand the events we need to examine each one. For us
interested in Asimovian Psychohistory this means to examine them under the
light of it.
I want to examine the facts, and stay with them with as little
interpretation, as possible, and as little second-guessing as possible too,
though that may be occasionally unavoidable. Then I want to try to put the
facts into numbers in order to be able to get some calculated results out of
Regretfully it is going to be a rough, low resolution analysis. Nevertheless
it will give us a crude but real picture.
Opportunity, means, motives. These are key factors to the events and our
understanding them will give us the chance to neutralize them too, if we
want to minimize the chances of similar events will happening in the future.
Before looking at them we can divide those responsible for the attacks to
two obvious categories (groups):
a. Those who survived, and
b. Those who didn't survive.
These two categories differ not only by the outcome: survivors/non-survivors
but also by the different roles they played and by their motives too.
You see in group (a) belong all those who are behind the acts, the master
minds that designed them, their financiers, patrons etc.
In group (b) belong those who executed the acts and those are the ones that
I will examine first.
As a group is the most complex one and their motives cannot be explained by
simply labeling them as 'evil', something that could be said about the first
group, but more on this later.
Group (a)
1. Opportunities. These come and go. Sometimes a 'window' opens for a brief
time and then closes again. The opportunity in these particular events was
given by Time. The precise timing of the attack and the passing of time.
Facts: There had been some time since the last terrorist attack in the US
and 'guards' was down. Statistically, now and then opportunities for
terrorist hits arise and when the attack comes at 'right' moment their
success is entirely possible.
A lot can be done and is done towards the elimination of such opportunities.
You've heard it all, I'm sure, thorough airport checks etc. However those
with the motives and the means for terrorist acts are always looking for
such opportunities and statistically sooner or later they will succeed in
finding and taking advantage of them.
2. Means. They are the 'weapon', the tools of the execution. Again measures
taken against the means of a terrorist act can be very successful but time
and resourcefulness work for the terrorists.
Fact: This time they used knives, box cutters and commercial airliners.
There is no defense against the strongly motivated use of common everyday
things as weapons. Even a fork can do a lot of damage. Can you imagine the
paranoia of scanning passengers for forks? Again given time events of low
probability can happen too.
So we reach the single most important factor of everything: Motivation
3. Motives. Ultimately they are the most important factor, because in their
absence nobody bothers to act.
Facts: It is indisputable that the hijackers where highly motivated, they
sacrificed their lives after all for their cause.
That some people are sufficiently motivated to commit such acts to a degree
to give their lives in the process needs further examination. Because only
by eliminating the motives that makes them to act suicidal can we ensure an
adequate lowering of the probability of acts like that happening again.
Question1: Why they did it?
Question2: What can motivate a person thus?
Question3: What were their actual motives.
Answers: The first and most publicly discussed 'motive' is that they were
'religious fanatics'. Although that is a strong possibility leaves a lot of
questions unanswered and don't give a detailed picture of the hijackers. For
example: What turned them into religious fanatics? Even if they were
religious fanatics, what made the religious fanatics? Brainwashing, intense
indoctrination, money, love, hate? What?
The hijackers weren't, to all indications, illiterate savages, most had
probably had spend time living in the US, had studied in US colleges, some
knew how to pilot aircraft etc. Moreover the idea of them being just
religious fanatics oversimplifies things. If we think that this was their
only motive, we need not investigate their motives any further. It's the
absolute answer, blame it to fanaticism and stop worrying. But that is
misleading and give up a wrong or at least an incomplete picture.
Thus 'religious fanaticism' an answer is, for the time being, at least
incomplete, and until it answers more questions than it raises this motive
will be considered of secondary importance.
The most natural answer is that something made these people desperate enough
to act in the way they acted.
First interlude.
I want to bring to your attention, two loosely related facts, and the
questions that rise from them:
1. There where celebrations in Palestine and Iraq. As a contrast to those
celebrations I saw someone on the CNN wondering over them as seen under the
light of the tragedy and the pain the victims still suffer. Question: Are
the people of Palestine and Iraq so cynical in front of the pain and the
losses of innocent lives?
2. For many people it's hard to accept why there is so much hatred,
genocides and atrocities in the world. Yet all those are hard facts of life
and the very difficulty some people face in accepting these facts indicate a
lack of information. You see when one has all the information of the causes
the effects should be obvious, that's what Psychohistory hopes anyway.
Question: to what information I'm referring?
Honest answers could be painful but will guarantee a better comprehension of
the recent events.
Facts  in numbers
Now we have a number of those people motivated to commit suicidal terrorists
acts. It is reported that they were about 24. The precise number is
irrelevant. Lets call their number 'T'.
That 'T' number of willing to die terrorists did not came out of thin air.
They came from a larger pool of candidates of 'C' number and we know that
greed and personal profit was not their motive because they knew they would
What do all these 'C' people had in common? Perhaps many things, but one is
very relevant here. They all shared an intense hate toward the USA. A hate
that made them insensitive to the knowledge that blind terrorist acts mainly
hurt innocent people. So there is an 'H' number of people that hates the USA
enough to make them hurt the innocent. Now this 'H' number obviously come
from even greater number of people that something in their lives made them
to hate the USA. They cannot be people who profit by the US policies.
Religion alone is not an important factor here. Islam is not by definition
anti-US, it's not by definition pro-Arab either. They must be people who are
or feel personally damaged by the US policies. Given the extent of US
influence around the globe there must be a 'D' number of people who are
displeased by the US, but these people must be very displeased indeed.
Question: What did make them so displeased in the USA?
Second Interlude
No we have a rough form of an equation here:
We initially have a pool of D number of people out of which comes a T number
of suicidal terrorist:
Where does this D number of people comes from?
Historical Fact sheet 1:
The USA during the last 30 years (that is since 1971) have:
Mercilessly bombed three countries:
Invaded two countries:
Placed various types of - common people affecting - sanctions against:
N. Korea
Military intervered in:
Also intervered in:
El Salvador
I'm surely missing out some countries but I think I've made my point.
Fact sheet 2
Many of the current US menaces were initially financed and helped by the US
before they become the US archenemies:
Noriega of Panama
Saddam of Iraq
And. Ossama Bin Ladden
They all were tenderly cared by the US at some point.
All those facts are indisputable. One can defend such US actions as having
'right' reasons. In this study that's irrelevant.
Even if all those actions were for the best of reasons, which is debatable,
as an aftereffect they resulted in the creation of a very specific group of
people. Innocent people that saw their lives, properties, houses, destroyed,
themselves hurt or injured and their loved ones and relatives dead, all
because they happened to be in the wrong place of the world or the wrong
side of a conflict. These are the 'D' people described above.
There are two lines of action that can be suggested from this
Psychohistorical study of the recent bombings in the USA.
A. A thorough check on the past of people entering the USA will show who of
them have, potentially, a reason to hate the US. Those who have seen their
lives damaged because they happened to be 'collateral damage' in one of the
US military actions are obviously more prone to suicidal 'religious
fanaticism'. Will work for a short term but a more effective one will be the
B. The best way to limit the number of willing to die terrorists (T) is to
reduce the (D) number of people that are hurt by American policies. That
will work better in the long run. Just think that an average of 5000
children die each month in Iraq because the US sanctions. That results in at
least 10000 people who are very displeased with USA. Now that's a big tank
from which any clever 'religious fanatic' usurper can tap for human
Under this light Madeleine's Albright  comment that 'they think' of it all
that 'the price is worth it (were the price is the dead Iraqi children)' is
suddenly less convincing. Is it not?

Are we seeing the beginning of the end of the concept of 'nation'? Are we
faced with the incontrovertible truth that we either abandon the concepts
of science/technology, accept a autocratic state where our every move is
reviewed for threat potential, or do we find another solution to the
problems of mankind other than the 'state'? Are these the only three
It is clear that any assault on 'method' will fail because there is an
infinite regress. Instead we should focus on 'motive' since if a person is
never motivated to commit the act in the first place the 'method' becomes
moot. This raises the question of what does 'individual' or 'independent'
mean in a technology filled world?
It is also clear that CACL solutions won't work, the example of armed
aircraft passengers during a high-jack clearly demonstrates how such
confrontations can be turned against the passengers to their own
detriment. Their very biological nature makes such solutions unworkable.
Is it time that all forms of human government recognize the fundamental
limits imposed by physics (something even CACL theory doesn't do)? Whatever solution works must include some form of neutral third party
conflict resolution mechanism. And the solutions of that mechanism must
not resort to forceful coercion. It must recognize the fundamental right
of the individual to not go along with the majority in (nearly?) all
Is it time we recognize that the good of the many doesn't outweight the
needs of the few in all cases? And that in any case the initiation of
violence (physical or not) is never justified? That irrespective of the
issue forcing someone to participate only creates more problems in the
future that any possible good that may come from forcing the current
resolution? That these problems will pile up until there is no solution
other than a complete 'reboot'? That individuals have a fundamental right to say "No, I won't participate" irrespective of the issue? That in fact
Lincolns 'universal law of nations' is nothing more than a scam? Does the
threat of future technology applications justify abandoning those
applications? Do we put a cap on our lifestyle?
I propose that the only solution isn't forcing people to participate but
rather offering voluntary opportunities to participate. Buy their
cooperation. Is this the true future of 'economics'?

Not that I have done it or will do it. But that you can't search my house,

to search my house.
The point is to gain the opportunity for unrestrained entry to others

24, 2001
THE TERROR TEST AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE WESTERN WORLD
We are facing an alliance of leftist forces remnants of Communism and
radical Moslem movements, in which the dictator Fidel Castro places his
The bloody episodes of terror of September 11th, which occurred
simultaneously in New York and Washington, could in some ways be
interpreted as a huge testing of the North American and world public
opinion, at the hands of anti-Christian forces bent on the destruction
of the Western World. As pointed out by the German strategist Karl von
Clausewitz, the main objective in a war is to eliminate the adversary's
will to resist.  Following that line of thought, the attack on September
11th proved, in the midst of tragedy, in an uplifting reality for the
Western world and undoubtedly uncomfortable for its adversaries: rising
above the pain, uncertainty and the irreversible changes in every day
life, the majority of the people of North American reacted in the spirit
of patriotism and with a determination to resist the enemy, with an
intensity difficult to predict after the nature of such attacks.
Meanwhile, in Latin America a phenomenon is taking place which causes
great apprehension: after the initial horror and consequent solidarity
with the victims, the public opinion has suffered a subtle but effective
pressure from leftist forces, through the media, to try to blame what
happened on the United States, presenting the victims as those which
launched the attacks.
In an attempt to obtain this unacceptable roll reversal, the same
mechanism that has been used so many times to absolve the Communist
regime of Cuba by making the exiled Cubans and the United States the
aggressors. This the same type of play with words by the left that were
used during the 1960's and the 1980's to justify the aggressions in the
continent of pro-Castro guerilla forces.
Regrettably,  there are ecclesiastical voices, independent from their in
tentions, that are allowing themselves to be used in that dangerous
game.  For example, the influential Brazilian Archbishop Mons. Luciano
Mendes de Almeida, who served in a prominent position in the Catholic
Conference of Brazil and in CELAM, said referring to the attacks of
September 11th:  "It is because of the extreme amount of poverty and the
domination of some countries over others, that things of this nature
This type of talk is occurring mainly in Latin America put it can also
be heard in Europe and even in the United States, with the collaboration
of those mechanisms that protect the so called anti-globalization
movements.  In the concrete order of the acts which occurred we are in
the presence of an alliance between leftist forces remnants of Communism
and radical Moslem movements, in which the dictator Fidel Castro places
his expectations of survival.
All of this brings us to a fundamental theme, in which we have insisted
upon an uncountable amount of times, when it comes to the defense of the
Western world and the cause of freedom of Cuba: the importance of
publicity. In effect, it seems exaggerated to say after having witnessed
the destructive capacity of terrorism, but in reality the decisive
battle continues to be in the psychological and ideological fields. A
type of battle which is capable of destroying man spiritually, all the
while maintaining his physical health intact.
We decidedly enter into a world where chaos is multiplied by chaos. To
learn to survive in that atmosphere means not accepting it as something
natural but instead each time we need to prepare ourselves to have more
will to resist and more of a vigilant spirit.
Without a doubt, the results of the test of terror where not totally
favorable for the anti-Christian forces.  But it is also true that we
have before us an arduous path, full of traps and things that are
unforeseen. Let us learn necessary lessons for the cause of freedom.
Far from the vicissitude of the present time and future circumstances,
the promise of the Most Holly Virgin in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917, which
is undoubtedly a motive for bright hope:  "At last, my Immaculate Heart
will triumph".

September 27, 2001
In the Next Chapter, Is Technology an Ally?
By KATIE HAFNER
OVER the last two weeks, computer scientists and others who think about
technology have wondered aloud about its likely role in countering
terrorism -- or in carrying it out. Have the limitations and dangers of
technology been overlooked? Where, on the other hand, might technological
innovation emerge or be redirected as a result of recent events?
For Ray Kurzweil, an expert in artificial intelligence and an innovative
figure in computing, the events are already accelerating technologies that
allow work, and people, to be dispersed rather than centralized. Security
experts like Peter Neumann point to the renewed interest - and perhaps
unfounded confidence - in technologies to confirm identities and track
"Overendowing high-tech solutions is riskful," Dr. Neumann said, "in the
absence of adequate understanding of the limitations of the technology and
the frailties and perversities of human nature."
Mr. Kurzweil and Dr. Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a
research group in Menlo Park, Calif., were among six technology experts
invited by Circuits to assess the challenges ahead. The other participants
were Bruce Sterling, a science fiction author who writes frequently about
technology; Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School who has
written extensively on law and the Internet; Severo Ornstein, a retired
hardware engineer and one of the computer scientists who worked on the
original Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet; and Whitfield Diffie, the
inventor of public key cryptography, a method of encoding electronic
Each has been in the public eye for a decade or more, thinking and writing
about the promise and peril of technology. Some are more sanguine than
others about a high-tech society.
Their discussion, conducted last weekend by e-mail, touched on technology's
possible uses in fostering security and on the issues that will arise along
the way. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. What role will technological innovation play in responding to terrorism?
Lessig These attacks could spur a great deal of technological innovation.
The hard question is whether the innovation will be tailored to protect
privacy as well as support legitimate state interests in surveillance and
control. We as a culture think too crudely about technologies for
surveillance. The conflict is always framed as some grand either/or. But if
we kept pressure on the innovators and, in particular, the government, to
develop technologies that did both, we could preserve important aspects of
our freedom, while responding to the real threats presented by the attacks.
Kurzweil The Sept. 11 tragedy will accelerate a profound trend already well
under way from centralized technologies to distributed ones and from the
real world to the virtual world. Centralized technologies are subject to
disruption and disaster. They also tend to be inefficient, wasteful and
harmful to the environment. Distributed technologies, on the other hand,
tend to be flexible, efficient and relatively benign in their environment
In the immediate aftermath of this crisis, we already see a dramatic
movement away from meetings and conferences in the real world to those in
the virtual world, including Web- based meetings, Internet-based
videoconferencing and other examples of virtual communication.
Despite the recent collapse of market value in telecommunications,
bandwidth nonetheless continues to expand exponentially, which will
continue to improve the resolution and sense of realism in the virtual
world. We'll see a great deal of innovation to overcome many of the current
Diffie Revision of the air traffic control system together with that of
other industrial command and control phenomena will push reliability and
security in computing and computer communications. Such systems may provide
a testing ground for the command and control of ballistic missile defense
systems in which response times may be slower but the spectrum of phenomena
requiring analysis will be broader.
Attempts to control the use of cryptography and other security measures
will make the development of improved command and control networks more
difficult and may impede this task by limiting the people who can
contribute to approved government and contractor personnel.
Lessig This "scenario of terror" was not low tech, for its impact was not
just the impact of the souls who were lost. As powerful was the effect of a
world watching as it occurred. The technology of a networked world meant
that scores of television cameras would be trained on the south tower, to
capture the horror of the delayed second impact. And the extraordinary
impact of these killings in two cities is the product of a heavily
integrated - technologically integrated - world community. Terrorists take
advantage of this technology to have the effect they seek. Elsewhere, in
places without this technology, it would not have the same effect.
Diffie Larry, this is a great observation. I wonder if it will be possible
to discover whether the attackers had that subtlety of thought.
Q. Larry Lessig says that the hard question is whether innovation will be
tailored to protect privacy as well as support legitimate state interests
in surveillance and control. Do you agree that we as a culture tend to
think too crudely about technologies for surveillance? Where do you think
the trade-offs should be?
Neumann The most elaborate technological measures are likely to be
inadequate, misused and subverted. Surveillance is all too easily misused.
Trapdoors in cryptography to facilitate law enforcement can be misused.
Existing system security is seriously flawed. As a result, we must avoid
expecting technological security measures to be adequate in protecting
privacy. So, ultimately, we have a double-edged sword. Techniques to
protect can be used to subvert, attack or otherwise compromise human
rights, nation states and organizations. The problems are inherently human,
and technology can be used for good or bad.
Sterling The question is badly put. I don't worry much about Big Brother
states surveilling average citizens. It's just not cost-effective, and what
Mom says in Peoria just doesn't interest the serious power players in
spydom. I do worry plenty about sneaky political operatives carrying out
dirty-tricks campaigns against the private lives of prominent politicians.
The payoff there is huge. It can destabilize legitimate governments more
effectively than terrorism.
I don't think there's a good trade- off here. If we're going to use
surveillance as a weapon, then we should trust our democratic traditions
and arm the population with it.
Kurzweil The nature of these terrorist attacks and the organization behind
it puts civil liberties in general at odds with legitimate state interests
in surveillance and control. The entire basis of our law enforcement
system, and indeed much of our thinking about security, is based on an
assumption that people are motivated to preserve their own lives and
well-being. That is the logic behind all of our strategies from law
enforcement on the local level to mutual assured destruction on the world
stage. But a foe that values the destruction of both its enemy and itself
is not amenable to this line of attack.
Lessig This is a critically important insight. The real problem we face is
not slowness in technological innovation. The real problem is slowness in
legal and civil rights innovation in response to the technological change.
It was not until the late 1960's that the Supreme Court finally held that
wiretapping was regulated by the Fourth Amendment.
The reason for this failing has lots to do with the way lawyers think. We
are reactive traditionalists. It is hard to think creatively. But if we
used the same kind of innovative creativity that our Framers used in
crafting our government, we could craft creative balances between
technological capabilities and human weakness. Technologies can't be
guaranteed to be used only for the good. But technologies placed within
well-crafted institutional structures can be made more likely safe than not.
Diffie (Disclosure: I am in the protection business.)
In my view the natural trade-off is a broad public right to inquire (i.e.,
listen to the radio, point infrared sensors around, make video recordings,
analyze the data from the sensors with computers, etc.) and the right of
the individual to employ protection from surveillance (cryptography,
insulated walls, wearing a mask, using pseudonyms, etc.). This presumes a
commercial right to make and sell products that support the individual's
desire for privacy.
I read in the documents of the revolutionary era a recognition of a broad
right of the individual to act on self-perceived interest and generally not
to be required to cooperate with someone else's view of those interests.
This seems to me roughly what freedom means. The trends in contemporary
society that most bother me are not so much government use of wiretaps or
video cameras but such things as the requirement that cash transactions
over $10,000 be reported to the I.R.S., that I must show identification to

Ornstein I think there is a genuine tension between the desire for security
and for privacy/individual freedom. This is just an instance of the more
general conflict between the needs and desires of the individual and those
of the larger society.
Today's technology permits small numbers of people to wreak a
disproportionate amount of havoc. (Without jet airplanes, the hijackers
couldn't have done much damage with their box cutters.) I suspect the
debate about where to draw the security line will probably be ongoing and
will depend on how much damage occurs in the future: The more damage, the
tighter we'll circle the wagons.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 558  September 26, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein,
and James Riordon
ENTANGLEMENT OF MACROSCOPIC OBJECTS, a pair of
gas clouds containing a trillion atoms each, has been achieved by a
research team in Denmark  (Eugene Polzik, University of Aarhus,
011-45-89423745, polzik at ifa.au.dk), constituting by far the
largest material objects entangled on demand and paving the way
for quantum teleportation between macroscopic objects. The
accomplishment, published in this week's issue of Nature
(Julsgaard et al., 27 September 2001), was announced in
preliminary form this June at the first International Conference on
Quantum Information, sponsored in part by the Optical Society of
America and the American Physical Society.  One of the most
profound features of quantum mechanics, entanglement is a special
interrelationship between objects in which measuring one object
instantly influences the other, even if the two are completely
isolated from one another.   No previous entanglement with atoms
has involved more than four particles. Furthermore, atoms have
only been entangled at close proximity, either as ions spaced
microns apart in a tiny trap (Update 475), or atoms flying over a
short range through narrowly spaced cavities (Hagley et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett., 7 July 1997).  In the present experiment, researchers
sent a light beam through two cesium gas samples, each held in a
special paraffin-coated cell.  The beam changed each sample's
"collective spin," which describes, in a sense, the net direction in
which all of the atoms' tiny magnets add up.  First, the researchers
measured the sum of the two collective spins without knowing the
individual collective spin of each sample.  A subsequent
measurement, nearly a millisecond later, showed that the sum
remained the same.  This demonstrated that the two gas samples
maintained their special interrelationship and were entangled. Although the two samples were just millimeters apart, they could
in principle be separated, and thereby entangled, at much longer
distances.  Entanglement of such large objects enables "bulk"
properties, like collective spin, to be "teleported," or transferred,
from one gas cloud to another.  THE BLACK HOLE OF GENEVA.  Black holes are known as the

Home Computers Are Becoming
More Common Target for Hackers
Associated Press
WASHINGTON -- Computer hackers, once satisfied to test their skills on
large companies, are turning their sights to home computers that are
faster, more powerful and less secure than ever before.
The hackers can steal your identity, destroy your data or use your computer
to launch attacks on Web sites or your friends.
"Home machines weren't very interesting targets a few years ago," said
Mikko Hypponen of antivirus company F-Secure in Finland. "That's all
changed now."
Experts attribute the threat to several factors:
*	Many home computers are now as powerful as business computers, with
enough memory and processing power to make them alluring staging areas for
wide-scale Internet attacks that affect other computers.
*	A growing number are connected directly to the Internet through
high-speed DSL and cable lines that remain open all the time. Computers
that are left on around the clock are vulnerable.
*	Unlike businesses with permanent security staff, most home users are
slow to secure their computers with the latest antivirus and firewall
software and to plug security holes by downloading the necessary fixes from
software makers such as Microsoft Corp.
*	Many home users are unaware of Internet threats and are too willing to
click on unsolicited e-mails that might be infected with malicious programs.
"Home users have generally been the least prepared to defend against
attacks," Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team
Coordination Center warns. "In many cases, these machines are then used by
intruders to launch attacks against other organizations."
Internet analyst firm Jupiter Media Metrix estimated that 71.2 million
American households had personal computers in 2001, almost three-quarters
of the nation's households, and 61.2 million had Internet access.
Viruses and worms -- which are viruses that don't need human intervention
to multiply -- make up a large part of the new threats to home computers.
In the past year, users' computers have been infected with malicious
programs with catchy names like Code Red, Nimda, SirCam, Anna Kournikova
and others that could be spread through e-mail or by surfing the Internet.
Antivirus firm Message Labs reported that it detected one virus per 370
e-mails in 2001, double the rate of the previous year.
The potential damage from hackers is also growing.
Several years ago, virus writers were content to simply destroy data on a
computer. Now they can imbed malicious programs that spy on users or steal
their identity, use personal computers to attack other systems and use an
e-mail address book to unwittingly infect the computers of people's
Even the most savvy users have been victimized. An FBI cybercrime
researcher's computer infected with the SirCam program sent out official
documents that spread the virus -- to the bureau's embarrassment.
The federal government is trying to better educate and insulate home users,
hoping it will slow the spread of Internet viruses or worms that could slow
the entire Internet and its e-commerce.
The outbreak of the Code Red Internet worm last summer sparked an
unprecedented show of force from government and private industry.
"We've never seen a virus before that would not affect end-user machines at
all; it just jumped from one Web server to another," Mr. Hypponen said. "It
really made Code Red more like a weapon than anything else."
Although home computers were not affected, the message government and
private security experts want home users to take from that threat is that
computer maintenance needs to become as routine as locking your house and
Home users need to routinely update their antivirus and Internet firewall
software against the latest threats and check for software fixes that
software makers provide for free.
"If you've got a system out on the Net and it's not patched, there's a very
high degree of likelihood that literally in a matter of hours you'll be
popped," warned Amit Yoran of computer security firm Riptech.
New technologies will be at risk to hacking this year, Mr. Yoran cautioned.
Wireless networking, which is now so cheap and easy to use that consumer
models are growing popular, is especially vulnerable.
"The standard itself is insecure," Mr. Yoran said. In a large-scale test of
urban wireless networks done by Riptech, experts couldn't find a corporate
network they couldn't break into.
"What we're faced with is widespread adoption [of wireless networks]
throughout corporate America and throughout consumer markets and people
haven't really thought through how to protect," he said.
With more and faster computers on the horizon and no sign of hackers giving
up their pursuits, home users will have to take security more seriously.
"They think if they don't have any secrets, they aren't a target," Mr.
Hypponen said. "But it's not like that at all."

I'll be happy to let you talk to my lawyer (he used to be an Asst.
Attorney General) and you can call APD directly if you'd like. They DO
include burglary with respect to using deadly force. In fact, in say a
case like somebody breaking into your car and stealing CD's, to be legally
protected you MUST see them with your property, simple 'belief' is not
enough. Of course there is nothing to stop you from planting between the
shooting and the arrival of your local LEA.
Big fucking deal.

I do, I also understand the sorts of questions that a DA will ask when
they decide what charges to press. And a simple broad daylight B&E will
not pass muster for deadly force in Texas. A simple trespass won't
qualify. You simply can't go around shooting people you lure onto your
property in Texas.
And I am absolutely certain they did NOT tell you or anyone else that by
simply finding a person in your home you have license to shoot on site.
That simply isn't the case in this state.
The 'at night' stipulation to escalated use of force is with respect to
the 'identify & recover' clause(s). Unless you can demonstrate some clear
threat at the time of the shooting, it being nite is about your only hope
to escape some sort of charge (there's that 'other means' with respect to causing the crime to stop as well). DA's know there are a passle of
crazies out there with itchy fingers. As I understand it, at least urban
legend wise, Texas is the 7'th largest armed population in the world...;)
This is from discussion with APD on three seperate 1st person instances
and several discussions with a lawyer several years ago (I had this crazy
idea of a IR directed gun mount). I also know of a couple of cases in the
last few years where the 'at night' stipulation was critical. There was 10
or so years ago where a girl shot a peeping tom just after dusk. She saw
him looking through the window. Got her gun and went outside and shot him.
The major issue with the grand jury refusing to indite had to do with it
being at nite.
It's also worth noting that Texas does not consider breaking into a car

Actually the value of the government in power will drop to zero. If they
make the change then it simply means that the government will change once
again (the peso and their value is a irrelevant side issue). There will be
one of two results. The first, if the 'power' structure stays in place is
even more draconian approaches to solving their problem. The other, if the
'power' structure fails to follow the status quo is a more free market
The operable question:
What will the Argentinian military and police do if this attempt fails?

Hiding Sensitive Data Can Be Tough in a Digital Age
By JOHN MARKOFF
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 13 - The modern task of successfully destroying
electronic documents has become daunting enough to give Oliver North
Mr. North is the Marine officer who became notorious during the Reagan-era
Iran-contra scandal after it was discovered he had tried to delete
thousands of e-mail messages, only to discover that they had been retained
on backup tapes and made available to Congressional investigators.
The issue of the destruction and possible retrieval of electronic data
burst into the news last week after Arthur Andersen & Company, the auditors
for the Enron Corporation (news/quote), said that the accounting firm had
destroyed a "significant but undetermined" number of documents relating to
Enron and its finances.
The embarrassing acknowledgment set off new demands from Congress that
Andersen produce a wide range of documents, including e-mail and other
computer files for investigators.
Today, Mr. North's efforts would be vastly more complicated because of
changing computer technologies and the emergence of the Internet, which has
ensured that there will be multiple copies of almost any electronic
"Today documents aren't just stored. They're sent," said Mark Rasch, a
former federal prosecutor who is vice president for cyberlaw at Predictive
Systems (news/quote), a network security consulting firm based in Herndon,
Va. Even though many companies have general procedural rules that require
the periodic deletion of e- mail, he noted, messages can usually be
"The sender and the recipient may have the message on their machine, in
addition to the server where it was stored," he said. "Unless there is a
tool used to remove it using military-grade technology, it can be
Most computer-literate office workers now realize that simply deleting an
e-mail message or moving a document onto the trash icon on their computer's
desktop screen does not eliminate the data.
That is because modern computers organize information by using file-system
directories that point to physical areas on a disk drive where the data
resides. "Deleting" the information usually only breaks the link between
the directory and the data so that the original storage space can be reused
in the future.
To eliminate important data, some companies and individuals use software
tools that try to "wipe" files from storage disks by writing random strings
of 1's and 0's over the space where the files were stored. Others will use
programs that "defragment" disks by moving information around on the
surface of the disk so that data can be retrieved more efficiently, which
can also write over old data. Or they can reformat the drives entirely.
What most computer users do not realize, however, is that the world of
computer forensics has made huge strides in recent years, and it is now
remarkably difficult to hide data from a determined investigator.
"Computer forensics is going to play an important role in recovering
documents in the Enron case," said John Patzakis, president and general
counsel of Guidance software, a company in Pasadena, Calif., that makes
hardware and software used by law enforcement authorities as well as the
Big Five accounting firms.
Every action taken by a computer user leaves a telltale trail, he said, so
the act of deleting documents can itself be revealing.
"Not only can computer forensic techniques recover documents, but they can
inform investigators when and how they were deleted," he said. "It is often
possible to determine if a deletion is an innocent act pursuant to a
corporate policy or if there is an ulterior motive." Even more remarkable,
technical means exist to retrieve data that has been erased.
It is possible to take a disk apart and use an electron microscope to read
information from the individual magnetic spots on the surface of a disk
that may have been intentionally erased, Mr. Patzakis said.
Originally a tool of the intelligence world, this technique - which is
costly - has been used successfully in big legal cases.

Web Security Company Takes No Prisoners
By CHRISTINE BLANK
s a former airborne infantry officer in the Army, Clarence Briggs was
trained to protect the country from foreign enemies.
Now, he is using those specialized skills to protect his company, Advanced
Internet Technologies, from hackers, competitors and disgruntled employees.
Surrounding the company's property in Fayetteville, N.C., is coiled razor
wire atop a six-foot chain-link fence. The buildings have eight-inch- thick
concrete walls and are patrolled by uniformed guards with ready access to
firearms. Mr. Briggs explained that he did not want competitors to steal
server computers or data - something he said he had seen at other companies
that like his, serve as hosts for client's Web sites.
Mr. Briggs, who founded the privately held company six years ago along with
other former military people, has also installed video cameras, created
password access to secured areas, locked sensitive documents in a vault and
insisted on extensive employee background checks.
He said such measures were necessary to protect the 32,000 Web sites the
company operates for companies based in this country and abroad.
"Security must absolutely pervade an organization, especially an I.T.
organization," Mr. Briggs said, using an abbreviation for information
technology. "Most I.T. organizations don't even know how bad they get hurt
- until it's too late."
He says that the company, which is generally known as A.I.T., deals with
several attempted network hacker attacks a day.
Fortifications include A.I.T.'s custom-made firewall software, vigilant
surveillance by the staff - most of whom are military veterans with
extensive technical training.
"If I catch you, no expense is too great for me to come after you, and I
will make your life miserable," Mr. Briggs, a former major, said. The
A.I.T. team tracks down perpetrators, then either phones them or sends
representatives from the company or local law enforcement agencies to warn
against further attempts.
"We employ a lot of little traps to track folks that access our network,"
Mr. Briggs said. "We use the typical ambush techniques."
The company is so confident of its preparedness that it plans to offer a
security service for corporations this spring. The program, Mr. Briggs
said, will be modeled on A.I.T.'s mix of physical and electronic security,
along with a "rapid deployment team" that can be quickly dispatched to deal
with security breaches.

@_subject: password-cracking by journalists... (fwd) 
A couple of months ago, a Wall Street Journal reporter bought two
abandoned al Qaeda computers from a looter in Kabul.  Some of the
files on those machines were encrypted.  But they're dealing with
that problem:
Does anyone have any technical details on this?  (I assume that it's
a standard password-guessing approach, but it it would be nice to know
for certain.  If nothing else, are Arabic passwords easier or harder
to guess than, say, English ones?)
