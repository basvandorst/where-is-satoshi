My company is hiring for two positions, a Senior Software Engineer
and a Software Technician.  We want to hire these people as soon as
we can, but are looking for first-quality personnel.  I would appreciate
your passing these on to people you believe are appropriate.  Here are the net postings on the two positions.
-Dave Ross
For Senior Software Engineer:
   RAF Technology inc. is a maker of pattern recognition solutions.
RAF is a leader in Optical Character Recognition for forms.  We have
challenging problems and needs hard working creative people to solve
them.  We are constantly trying to find new algorithms that will
recognize printed information faster and more accurately.     We are looking for a full-time, senior engineer. This inventor will
be a part of a small team.  An excellent working relationship with the
others is important.  The candidate must be fun to work with, creative
and enjoy meeting the commitments we make to our customers.
   RAF is located in Redmond Washington, which is a suburb of Bellevue
and is about 20 miles from downtown Seattle.
   We are looking for someone with experience in the following:
Algorithm development
User interface design
Unix, C, and C++.
   Experience with co-processor cards, and other hardware accelerators
is a plus. Experience with SGML would be helpful.
   Please mail, or e-mail your resume to:
Bill Greenhalgh
RAF Technology Inc.
16650 NE 79th St Ste 200
Redmond WA 98052
job at raf.com
Make it clear you are looking for the Senior Engineer position.
For Software Technician:
   RAF Technology is looking for a software technician.  We are a
small company that makes pattern recognition software.  The immediate
responsibilities will be to collect large data sets that will be used
for forms recognition training and performance evaluation.  This
person will also write test programs and test proceedures for RAF's
software libraries and user interfaces.  The ideal candidate will have
a BS in engineering or sciences.  This position potentially offers an
opportunity to move into a salaried engineering position.
   The position is in Redmond, Washington.  It is paid by the hour, and we offer flexible hours, but we need 40 hours a week.
   The candidate will have the following skills:
C programming experience.
Unix, X-Windows, and MS-DOS experience.
