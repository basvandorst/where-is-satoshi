This looks like Pirate Pay is injecting multiple sybils into the
DHT with node-IDs close to the info-hash of the file, thus making
the sybils responsible for the file.  This assures that all queries
are sent to the sybils, allowing the sybils to sent out false
information to the other peers.
A couple of years ago, some of my colleagues did work on this
in the context of p2p localization.  Their paper [1] describes their
results in much more detail.

Bittorrent DHT is based on Kademlia, and I am not an expert on
Kademlia (I will let my colleagues whose paper [2] I mentioned
earlier speak out as experts).
But, it seems to me that once the sybils have made themselves
responsible for the resource, they can selectively include good peers
but in smaller numbers so as to keep the rate of successful downloads
low.  So the point is not to completely stop downloading but to impact
it enough that a majority of downloaders fail.  A snipped from a
follow-up interview of Pirate Pay's founders appear to support this [1]:
  "We used a number of servers to make a connection to each and
  every p2p client that distributed this film. Then Pirate Pay
  sent specific traffic to confuse these clients about the real
  I.P. addresses of other clients and to make them disconnect
  from each other,b Andrei Klimenko said. bNot all the goals were
  reached. But nearly 50,000 users did not complete their downloads."
The analysis by Varvello and Steiner [2] indicated that 3 or 8 sybils
are enough to command an info hash.  I suspect that the cost, then,
from Pirate Pay's point of view is low and the perceived payoff high.
