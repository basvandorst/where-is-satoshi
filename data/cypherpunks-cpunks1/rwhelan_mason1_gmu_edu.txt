Well actaully, since we just recently got perl installed on our system,
I have been playing around with the elm and nn scripts.  They seem to
work resonably well, but it looks like they need a little work.  The do
detect if the message is PGP encrypted or if it has a PGP signature in
it and when I mail things it asks if I want to sign it or encrypt it.
They need a little polishing but they do work.  Anyone else has any
experience using this? anyone got any suggestions?
Sometime when I am not so tired I am going to play with the emacs and
tin scripts.
