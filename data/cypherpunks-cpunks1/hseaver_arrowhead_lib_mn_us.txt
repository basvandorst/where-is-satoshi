@_subject: Reiserfs and Crypto 
Anybody know of any work being done with reiserfs and cypto. The
pluggable modules aspect of reiserfs seems made to order for it. Has
anybody tried running cfs or tcfs on top of reiserfs? That woouldn't be
as cool but ...

So who really gives a rat's ass what windoze lamers set their shitty OS to
do one way or another? Duh! Why spam the list with this crap? Here's to the script kiddies -- may they live long and fruitful lives, creating more
and better (and better hidden) fun things!

Well, it's more like the Nazi's are allowed to march in Jewish
neighborhoods under court orders protecting their right to free speech -- which
has happened -- it's disgusting, yes, but still has to be allowed to protect
everyone's free speech.
      Note that M$ doesn't believe in free speech for others, however, as we
recently saw with them lobbying Congress to do something about "un-American open
source" software.

Doing a little research to be up to speed on cable...
PacketCable is interesting, as it talks about online gaming, telephony,
etc... but check out this part of the spec.

MR.ZHU JIAN-JIN;
   Oh, wonderful! I see by your post on the Cypherpunks list that you are
recruiters for the Falun Gong, please send me some Falun Gong literature
at once.

Interesting tho that they make a point several times that they aren't
under CALEA, but seem to be extremely ready to roll right over regardless,
including for non-VoIP taps.

A magic one, of course.
     Why? A female spirit appears to you, that's a "Good Thing", eh?
      Only one way to find out, but probably if she's appearing to you nude,
it's obvious.
      Wouldn't she have the capability of appearing just right for you?
       Good grief, why not? Are you afraid of the dark too? I prefer being
in the woods alone, or perhaps with my dog. And She Who Speaks often
whispers in my ear at such times, which probably won't happen if others are
near, unless they happen to be tuned in to the same frequency at the moment.
       Both of the above, or perhaps the reverse -- take the apple and bite
the woman.
           I'm always looking for encounters with female spirits.

Not in the slightest, note that I said "both the above, *or perhaps* the
reverse. I'm a goddess worshiper -- and some of the feminine spirits I commune
and commingle with don't even take human form, let alone "beautiful,
unclothed".   8-)  I do like to nibble tho.

I was subscribed to cyberpass.net, been gone for two days and
came home to no cpunks mail. Subscribed to lne and it started flowing
       Pretty weird -- even wierder is what happened to openpgp -- I was
subscribed to that one, it went down, came back up, went down again and
never a word from the owner since.
