@_subject: change in anonymizer log policy 
Looks like Anonymizer's changed their logging policy.
Does the Anonymizer keep logs on who I am and the sites I
visit? How long do you keep logs? Will you release the
information? The Anonymizer logs only a hash of your IP number (machine
address). We cannot determine your IP number from these logs,
however, this enables us to have logs to study in order to increase
performance, and as a deterent to prevent abusive use of the
Anonymizer for purposes such as e-mail spamming, harassment, and so
on. If we didn't, many people would use it for these purposes, and
the usability of the service would deteriorate as a result.
Anonymizer tools are not a shroud for those who wish to engage in
illegal and unscrupulous activities. However, due to high usage, it
is impossible for us to keep logs for very long, and we cannot
maintain archives. See our user agreement for more details.

Worse, there may be any number of "controlling legal authorities".
You don't suppose that all the existing radio monitoring equipment is
going to stop working just because the infrastructure for managing it
is in disarray?
Or that people with access to that equipment are going to have any
problem getting fuel for their helicopters from government fuel dumps?
But your communication network is going to become a valuable resource,
and more than one tin-pot wannabe is going to want to get his hands on
