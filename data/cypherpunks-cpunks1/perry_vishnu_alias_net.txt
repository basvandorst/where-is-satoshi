@_subject: Subscribing to cypher-list 
Hello Everyone,
expected. But I see some clarification is required.
1. I have had several inquiries as to why the list is closed. Not
having a good reason as to why, I've opened the list. Anyone can
subscribe that wants to.
2. In order to subscribe, you must encrypt your subscription request
isn't encrypted. That's the whole point of the security. Other than
the encryption, the subscription method is the same as most
3. Please send you subscription requests to
cypher-list-request at vishnu.alias.net rather than
majordomo at vishnu.alias.net. I was willing to add the subscriptions
that failed by hand, but the number of requests has made this a
time-consuming job.
4. What is the PGP public key for majordomo at vishnu.alias.net? It's
available by anonymous FTP from vishnu.alias.net as
ftp://vishnu.alias.net/pub/majordomo.pgp. I'm also listing the key
send email to perry at vishnu.alias.net.

@_subject: New Mailing List (encrypted) 
Hello everyone,
created a new mailing list that you can join if you wish. It's a
closed mailing list, so subscriptions must be approved. What makes
this mailing list different is that all submissions are encrypted and
all outbound messages are encrypted to the PGP key of the
recipient. This means you can discuss whatever you wish without fear
of discovery or retribution. The name of the mailing list is
cypher-list and it's home is vishnu.alias.net. The theme of the
mailing list is basically anything one might discuss about
cryptography, crypto-politics, remailers, government, Kevin Mitnick,
etc. It's kind of like cypherpunks but accepts a wider discussion
base. The difference is encryption. As mentioned above, the list is
handled in a secure fashion. I've included the help file for PGPdomo
below to assist in subscribing to the list. Here is the simplified for
for subscribing:
Send email to cypher-list-request at vishnu.alias.net
subscribe cypher-list
[your PGP public key in ascii-armored format]
You have reached the J. P. and Associates "Majordomo" mailing list
manager, version 1.93.  This is a modified version of Majordomo 1.93 that includes PGP support.  Majordomo's public key is
available at:
            ftp://vishnu.alias.net/pub/majordomo.pgp
Additionally, the public key for Majordomo at vishnu.alias.net can be found on
the PGP keyservers.
Majordomo at vishnu.alias.net will accept the following commands in clear-text (i.e no encryption): help; lists; info; and which.
All other clear-text commands must be sent to the specific list using the email address:
Where  is a valid listname without the <> characters.
In the description below, items contained in []'s are optional. When
providing the item, do not include the []'s around it.
It understands the following commands:
    subscribe  []
    [-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    Version: 2.6.2
    mQCNAzBoq         Your PGP version 2.6.2          EKOUFKNl+Ytk+O

    d3cuaGEub3NkLm1pbD4=
    =l3kH
    -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----]
.  subscribe commands should always be sent in clear-text to
-request at vishnu.alias.net.  Only include your PGP public key for
PGP protected lists.  We prefer (but not require) 1024 bit key
lengths.  We reject Public keys with less than 512 bits.  If
subscribing to a PGP protected list, include contact information such
as DSN or commerial phone number.
    unsubscribe  []
    get          Get a file related to .
    index         Return an index of files you can "get" for .
    which []
    who     info     lists
    help
    end
Commands should be sent in the body of an email message to -request at vishnu.alias.net.
Commands in the "Subject:" are line NOT processed.
If you have any questions or problems, please contact
Majordomo-Owner at vishnu.alias.net
Additional PGP information:
When submitting entries to a PGP protected list, please comply with
the following:
o encrypt the entire submission for Majordomo at vishnu.alias.net   (-e option of pgp)
o use Transport Armor (.asc, radix-64, the -a option of pgp)
o sign your submissions (-s option of pgp)
o use the linefeed conversion option (-t option of pgp)
'pgp -east submission Majordomo at vishnu.alias.net' where submission is your file should work nicely.

Well actually... The passphrase in a mixmaster remailer is defined as
an environmental variable at compile time. The passphrase is not
stored in any cleartext fashion but is embedded in the
executable. Additionally the newer Ghio code (Matt's latest revision)
has the passphrase defined as an environmental variable in
remailer.c. Once remailer is compiled, you can delete the passphrase
from the code. I can't speak for the freedom or other remailers as I
haven't tried them. It's a little harder to get the key than just
looking for a cleartext file that contains it. That is, if the
remailer operator is being careful.
