@_subject: pgp in the weirdest places! 
Hello out there - A friend of mine recently bought a computer and I've spent the past
couple days with him setting it up and stuff. Anyways, I've come across
some interesting stuff in his fax/modem software. In converting a
word processing text into a format the fax recognizes, I got a weird
file that seemed to be encrypted in pgp or something - I'm not sure
since I haven't seen pgp run on dos. That was no big deal but when I
scanned through the converted text I found various messages about pgp.
Some of it was obviously from the readme files but there was some other
stuff about some other Hughes guy (btw, I'm a newbie, so...) that wasn't
Eric. I'm not that familiar with pc so I couldn't really help him so I'm calling on you guys. The software is called "Quick Link II" It
claims to be the "Next Generation in Communication Software" and seemingly so. Its from Smith Micro Software Inc. and its being run
on yer average 486 sx20. I'll post the converted texts if there's
interest but in the meanwhile I am highly confused!

You can press *67 (or *69? in some places) to keep the receiver from
getting your phone number but your phone number is still sent - just not
displayed - more info in current ish of 2600.

(sorry if this is re-hash)
Today's SF CHRON reports:
Pac's Baby Bell will spend 15 billion installing fiber optics throughout
California. ATT will supply ATM switchers to convert the video
And PacTel Cellular will offer Bay Area cell users CDPD - faster and
more efficient cell data transmittion - it transmits the data in packets
during "the idle milliseconds of voice conversations carried on cell.
phone systems". So its compressed and....

Hey Cypherites,
While taking a *study* break last night I caught the last couple of minutes
of a report on the cellular phone hacking on Prime Time Live - KABC(?) west coast. Someone, presumably, from one of the cellular phone co's came up
with a security scheme that would stop people from hacking into other
people's accounts - using digital signatures! When asked how long this
*technology*'s been around he answered its been out for awhile, only it
has been implemented yet because no one was willing to pay for it. I Also, they mentioned something about 400 people being caught by the S.S.
so far this year(?) on cellular hacking charges. Is this correct? I didn't catch the whole show and am not sure if I ingested what was
being said properly (I was too tired to chew) so if anyone caught the
whole piece or knows more please post.
