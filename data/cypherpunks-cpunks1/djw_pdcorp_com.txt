If you read what they had to say about this, you know that they are
hoping others will create non-escrowed crypto hardware using the same
interface.  I see no reason for them to not include support for any
available hardware system (even if it includes GAK), as long as they
continue to support non-escrowed encryption internally.  This allows
the customer to decide that they have no problem with GAK and use the
external system, or use the internal system and not have GAK.
Until the current policy is clearly defined it is like a moving
target.  Once the government has been pinned down to a single policy,
it will be much easier to dispute their policies.  Currently the
government can say anything they want about their enforcement of ITAR,
because they have not stated a clear set of rules with regard to it.
Once they have set clear rules, those rules can be shown to be overly
restrictive or even unenforceable.
Also, lawyers usually advise clients based on a worst case scenario,
thus when the government is unclear on its rules, the lawyers advise
their clients based upon the worst possible interpretation of the law.
This is done to protect their client.  By not stating a policy, the
government is making that worst case happen, without having to be the
bad guy by actually attempting to enforce such a policy.
I think you are being too critical, they have done more than any
company I know of to make easy to use crypto widely available.  They
may be willing to obey the laws if they require GAK, but I do not feel
that they are just rolling over either.  I strongly oppose GAK, but I
do not believe that no crypto is better than GAK crypto.  I would
rather keep some people out than nobody out.

I see, you cannot say that they are really supporting GAK based upon
the actual statements made, so you simply assert it.
Yes, but making something an economically viable venture is very
useful.  That is what they have done.  They have implemented an
interface into a widely available piece of software.  This makes it
much more economically viable for others to implement strong crypto
into another product using the same interface.
Jeff Weinstein has said that Netscape is drafting an official position
paper and that it would be available in the near future.  If Netscape
lives up to this, we will soon enough have the companies position and
not just that of two employees (Jeff Weinstein and Jim Clark).  Why do
you feel you must jump to judge the company based on the opinions of
two of its employees?  This is especially questionable when one is
clearly stating that the company is against GAK and the other is at
worst being unclear.  If you feel they are being contradictory, wait a
week and look at their policy statement then decide.
Wait a week and read their official statement then decide.  You accuse
me of logical fallacies, but then argue through insult and assertion.
You have not pointed to a single fact or any contradictory statements
in posts to this list.  I will admit that Jim Clark was somewhat
unclear, but I attribute this to the fact that the official company
position is as yet not written and thus he is attempting to remain
somewhat neutral.
You asked why they wanted clarification and I simply responded.
Wait a week.  As far as their lobbying assertion falling apart, I must
have missed this.  My understanding is that:
A)  They support several industry groups that are taking an active
position in opposition to GAK.
B)  They have until very recently had only very limited resources.
C)  Have just recently hired an in house lobbyist.
D)  That they did not attend the Bernstein hearing.
Now given point B, I see no reason to expect that they would in the
past have done much more than they have.  Given point C, I see they
are currently expanding their lobbying.  If point D is the measure of
crypto correctness, then I to am guilty.  Though I do not live in the
vicinity, I guess I should have been expected to fly up to lend my
moral support.  Bovine excrement.
Again, you asked, I answered.  I did not expect that this would be new
to anyone on the list, but you asked.
You seem very concerned about what Netscape is doing, and as such
should be concerned about what their lawyers are _forced_ to tell
them.  I understand that the discussion is about Netscape not the
government, but discussing actions without discussing motives is
My point is that you are too quick to call your recent ally an enemy.
You may not see what Netscape has done as important, but I believe
that many do (including me).  They are supposed to have integrated
e-mail crypto in the final release of Navigator 2.0.  I will remind
you that Jeff Weinstein has said that this will not include GAK.
I am not saying that the choice is between either no crypto or GAK
crypto.  I am saying that they have only said that they will go to GAK
if the choice is between GAK crypto and no crypto.  To the best of my
knowledge they have not said that they would implement a GAK only
product in any other situation.  I think that this is reasonable, I do
not think that we should let it come to this.  We need to insure that
they (or anyone else) are never put into that position.  (and yes they
should to.)
I sent a message to Netscape after reading the article that started
this,  It simply stated that I wanted clarification on their position
on GAK and that if they were to support it they would lose a loyal
customer.  I have since been convinced by Jeff Weinstein's posts to
this list that the company does not support GAK, and in fact they
oppose it.  You would do better to spend less time insulting people
and more time trying to support your arguments.

You have just proven your self to be a hypocrite.  If you expect of
others more than you expect of your self, you need to reevaluate your
own life.  If you are not willing to risk your life, fortune, and
reputation on your beliefs, how can you expect Mr. Clark or anyone
else to do the same.

You are quoting a reporter and attributing it to Jim Clark, do you
understand what is wrong with that?  You need to specify that this is
not his statement, but a report of the jist of his comments.
It has been reported by those that attended the Clipper II meeting on
Monday(?) that the Netscape representative read an official statement
very much in opposition to GAK.  As far as I know, Clark was not
speaking for Netscape when he was making the speach that you have
refered to.  Unless you believe that an employee of a company is
always speaking for the company when they speak in public or you have
some information I am unaware of, you are presuming that Clark's
opinions are thos of Netscape.
Clark's statement was certainly something less than clearly in
oposition to GAK, but I think at worst he could be said to be resigned
to GAK, not a supporter of it.
Jeff Weinstein has promised that when the representative from the
conference returns to Mountain View, they will publish his statement
on web.
Again, you seem fixated on making Clark's opinions equivelent to the
position of Netscape Communications Corp, this is not a reasonable

My point is that anyone at any level can make two different types of
statements, those for themselves and those for the company.  If Jim
Clark makes a statement as the President of Netscape, then he is
speaking for Netscape.  If he makes a statement as Jim Clark, then he
is speaking for Jim Clark.  It is possible to not believe in something
ethically, yet see a financial advantage in supporting it.  Their is a
distinction that must be made, though admitedly the line does become
fuzzy when a senior person makes a statement, this is because he is
often the one driving the policy.

@_subject: Exporting software doesn't mean exporting 
The what U.S. law says and what U.S. officials can enforce are two
different things.  You are in violation of ITAR if you send crypto
software from Mexico to Europe over the INTERNET if it is routed
through the U.S..  Think of it like drugs being shipped through the
U.S., the drug lord that sent it throught is just as guilt under U.S.
law as the mule that is carrying it.  The problem is that ITAR was not
writen to take the current situation into consideration.  It is writen
to deal with physical equipment and concepts that only a small number
of people understand.  Given those perameters ITAR would work, but
given the current climate of readily available crypto software and
wide spread understanding of crypto technologies ITAR cannot do what
it was designed to do.
Quite to the contrary, U.S. law applies whereever the U.S. can enforce
it.  Their are  many U.S. laws that the U.S. attempts to enforce
outside the U.S..  One example is that the U.S. law allows the
abduction of those who have murdered U.S. citizens outside the United
States.  This law is in place in an attempt to protect U.S. citizens
from terorism.  If you do not believe me just ask Manuel Noriega

I used to work in ADP security for the U.S. navy and can tell you that
at least the Navy's requirements also include the machine's physical
security and the networks that these machines may be connected to.  In
fact I believe that Secret information can only be stored on a machine
in vault or on removable media.  These are not things that the average
individual is going to do with there computer.  Netscape only attempts
to secure the information being transferred from a trusted client and
a trusted server.  I have yet to see Netscape claiming that if you
install their software on your machine that you will never again
suffer from data loss.  Your expectations are ridicules, Netscape
cannot be held responsible for the end user not properly configuring
their machine.  Please stop wasting everyone's time with your
ridicules rants.  If you must continue to post your idiocy stop using
an anonymous remailer so that the rest of us who want to use this
mailing list for intelligent discussion can kill file you.

Yes, I believe that they have only ever given verbal agreement to this
sort of thing, which is worth the air it is written on.
You are assuming that because the government has chosen not to
prosecute MIT that they will not prosecute anyone else.  This is a
faulty assumption, laws are not invalidated if they are not enforced,
only if they are repealed or overturned.
Their are certainly issues that need to be discussed here, and before
any such discussion can take place we need a determination from the
government as to what sort of verification is adiquite.
