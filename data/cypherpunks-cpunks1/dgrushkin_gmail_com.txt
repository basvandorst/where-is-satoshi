@_subject: [DIYbio] DIYbio.org survey, win a free iPad/OpenPRC 
*Hello DIYers,
In the last few months, DIYbio and the community science movement have come under increasing scrutiny in policy circles. The attention rises from a spate of articlesthat paint citizen scientists as national security risks. I'm working in conjunction with DIYbio.org and the Wilson Center to dispell the misconceptions about the community. We need 7-15 minutes of your time to take this survey in order to show the policymakers a more accurate portrait of the community.  As a perk, those who complete the survey will be in entered into a drawing for your choice of an OpenPCR or iPAD 2.
Click here  to take the survey. (
Thanks again for your help!
