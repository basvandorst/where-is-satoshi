@_subject: let's learn each other 
Hello, Marko
Man of my desire is strong and tough.  He is worth thousands of others, he is confident and intelligent and he indeed knows how to rule.  I dream of a man who would be elder than me, thus wiser and much more experienced.  I am a weak woman and I need gentleman's shoulders to lean on.  You are a man of my choice and it would be great if you react to my interest towards you   I really wish you can be a real husband, a real man, and on my side I can be a real woman in all meanings, a wonderful wife, patient and soft mother to our children and good hostess to our house. Please don't make me wait any longer, tell me your feelings:
Waiting for your mail
