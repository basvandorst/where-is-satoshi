@_subject: Drive the SF Central Freeway, have your license plate 
Maybe '!number' was making it up, but license plate photography exists today in the Great White North.  A new freeway is being built through Brampton, the 407ETR, for Express Toll Route.  At each on and off ramp there are electronic pickups and video cameras.  You can subscribe to the toll by buying a transducer that sits behind your rear-view mirror, signals from which will be picked up by the the toll gates as you enter and leave the freeway.  If you elect not to subscribe your license plate will be photographed and you'll get a bill in the mail.  If you elect not to pay the bill you'll be nabbed for it the next time you go to get your drivers license or car registration renewed...
Big Brother is not only watching, he's recording your location
and destination, measuring your distance travelled, and charging you for the privilege of driving...

And so I wonder if this applies equally well to the "blocked site" lists used by blocking software that a school might use -- as a parent I want to know exactly from which sites the school is protecting my child... (and not merely the sites my child has attempted to access and been blocked from)
Perhaps the blocking software companies who sell to schools and libraries may need to disclose their lists based on this decision!

Perhaps.  Some of us are lurking here to learn more about this stuff, so any and all clarifications on obscure acronyms are appreciated.

@_subject: <nettime> PlayFair  > Sarovar 
That seemed short-lived.  Both links to the Playfair project at Sarovar are dead:  and   The search function doesn't come up with anything either...
Has there been any further news on this?

But then the ballot is spoiled, and not counted.
In Canada we have the option to "decline to vote".  Go to the polling station, register your name, take the ballot, then tell the clerk that you "decline to vote".  This indicates that you believe that no-one on the ballot is a suitable candidate for office.  The ballot is counted, but none of the candidates gets a vote.  This ensures that you don't accidentally elect an unsuitable candidate with a protest vote, ie. selecting the lesser of two evils.  By declining to vote you elect neither of the two evils.
I'm not sure what happens when there are more declined ballots than votes for a candidate. Certainly it should draw some media attention to the option of declining to vote -- I find that very few people know about it.  It sure caused a stir at our polling booth!

There's some wonderful Sicilian Reasoning in that: We can't reveal the rule because the Bad Guys would figure out what we're looking for.  But the Bad Guys already know what we're looking for, but we'll keep the rule secret anyway because we know they know what we're looking for. The thing is, the Bad Guys know that too...

I was listening to an ITC podcast with Ed Amoroso, security wonk at AT&T, who tried his best to make content filtering by the carriers sound like a good thing.
I found myself shaking my head in wonderment an awful lot as I was listening to this...
