Primrose Lake is a suspected entry point for the Project Earth Enema.  The land is pretty much swamp but it is too hilly and cold to be called that.  A little further north and the swamps are called Muskeg which are basically peat bogs.  Further south, from Lac La Biche and south, the land is black earth parkland and suitable for normal agricultural use.  The French Voyageur who were travelling for the Hudson's Bay Company or the Northwest Company pretty much polluted the gene pool in the Lac La Biche area in the 1700s.  The aboriginal people around Primrose Lake were probably spared some of this gene pool pollution as their land was considered so poor the Voyageurs didn't bother with direct contact.
While there are some cases of "The White Man" deliberating spreading disease in Canada (Kanada is not the correct spelling unless you speak like em Kree in Lac La Biche) there are no examples from the Primrose Lake region.  In general disease was transmitted by incompetence or accident in most areas.  Remember, it was pretty much the late 1800s before the concept of gems was accepted as the means of disease transmission.  Primrose Lake is off the beaten track which is why it was chosen for a weapons range.  As far as weapons testing it is nothing special except some cruise missiles with dummy warheads were tested years ago.
The oil companies don't discriminate.  For every aboriginal person they have screwed they have screwed 10 white people.  While many people like to believe natural gas is a clean fuel that only applies to its use and not its production.
This is somehow different then the treatment received by aboriginal people anywhere else in North American, South America, Australia and for that matter anywhere else you care to mention.  Look at history,  it is always one people conquering another, and guess what - white folks do the same to white folks, black folks do the same to black folks and name-your-colour does it to the same-color (and probably every other color).  Its called history and it happened back then and it happens now.  Just check out any current regional conflict.
Why should I feel guilt over what previous generations have done?  Insects do it, birds do it, mammals do it and people do it.  Even dolphins, the breeding heart liberals favourite, kill their competitors.  Cro-Magnon man displaced Neanderthal man, where do we draw the line?  My Romanian relatives had their land taken from them by Ukranian imperialists, within the last 100 years, why can't I make a claim?  The Canadian government abuses all of their citizens, why should aboriginal people of today get special treatment?  The Canadian government doesn't appear to be any worse than the US or Australian governments, or for that matter any other government.
I never thought this list was a home for the bleeding heart liberal tree hugger crowd.

Tim, you are getting much too cynical!  The current events are very much a knee-jerk reaction to threats many can't understand.  The National Guardsman who played the boogieman is probably a local good old boy with absolutely no cross cultural experience who translates his fears into hate against any person who appears to be any threat to what he thinks is important.
After December 7th 1941 the USA and Canada interned all residents of Japanese descent and confiscated their property.  At the time it apparently was a good idea, today it appears very extreme.   What is happening today is still very minor and very likely to go away as people realize the stupidity of their current fears.  The airport paranoia is nothing new in a global sense, Americans have just not experienced it domestically.  Amsterdam airport has many soldier looking fellows with their automatics level and their fingers on the trigger.  In Singapore in 1980, the old airport, taking a photo would get you arrested.  Much the same in Jakarta until they opened the new airport in the mid-80s.  Same in India in the 1980s plus the metal detectors were so sensitive the iron in your blood set them off and everyone was patted down.
I have many times experienced being paraded, through a gauntlet of armed guards, on the tarmac beside the plane to identify my baggage before it was loaded on the plane and I was allowed to board.  Talking about rude experiences, try arriving at a US west coast airport from southeast Asia with a Thai stamp in your passport and then telling immigration your occupation is a salesman.  Off you go for a detailed search where you must rationalize your desire to visit the great nation of the US of A.
In 1984 at Dehra Dun airport, Uttar Pradesh India, the airport terminal was a tent.  I knew I shouldn't take a photo but attempted anyway.  The armed soldiers were there before I could get a shot off and took my camera away - I got it back after the flight as you were not allowed to take photos from the airplane also.  I was not to be trusted.
As the armed soldiers were relieving me of my camera a business associate managed to take the same shot with a much smaller camera.  A copy of this print can be viewed at In retrospect this seems pretty funny but at the time they were ready to cart me off to the local police station.  If I wasn't a foreign visitor I would have been arrested.  In the late 80s I was travelling through Jakarta airport with a stone axe I had purchased in carry-on baggage.  It was an Irian Jayan looking piece which I figured I really needed.  Airport security removed it from my baggage as they feared I may run amok.  They returned the item upon landing in Singapore where it was considered very funny.
Bottom line is muuch of what is going on now is a knee-jerk reaction to a threat which many can't understand.  Over a short period of time most of the most of the excesses should be corrected as people have time to realize the extreme nature of many of the current restrictions.
On a positive note the Anthrax attack through the postal system may bring some very positive changes as people seek to reduce the amount of mail they receive.  If you are connected Email is faster and cheaper plus you can't get Anthrax through an Email message.  If you use a Microsoft mail client you can still catch lots of shit but it really doesn't hurt you.
On a the air travel side the current level of business travel really wasn't justified.  Customers are always going to want to meet their vendors face to face but travel for business meetings within one business or government organization can easily be replaced with video conferencing.
Actually why can't we change our government to where the assembly of elected respresentatives is virtual rather than physical.  When you let them congregate in one place they detach themselves from any obligation to the voters and are open to lobbying efforts and making backroom deals.  With today's technology they could be based within an office in their constiuency and linked to an assembly with video conferencing technology.  An ideal system would make them available to their constiuents for a portion of the day and linked to an assembly on a video basis for a portion of the day.  You could cut the corrupting influences and make the elected representative more responsive to the voters.

You may be right, I may be naive and I may be an apologistic idiot.  Your mention of the list and the guardsman being aware of this horrible threat coming through the airport were assumed but my thought was it was a local redneck or folks in a vigilante mood.  It would appear this person was targeted.  When such folks take actions like this there is a reaction, ie - the victim had it written up in a press release/article and the guardsman and airport appear pretty stupid. Hopefully the victim of this epsode, and others of similar episodes, will take legal action and sue.  Hopefully the American system will retain this ability.
I once lived in a society where everything I did was recorded.  I was a foreigner and I expected it.  I got picked up in a business related deal and the officers started the interrogation by telling me what they knew of my existence, they knew everything.  My long work hours were interpretted as an attempt to cook the books.  They knew every detail of my personal life.  I was guilty because I was an eager beaver, had to be....
In western liberal democracies we believe we have lots of freedom. Cross the wrong people and your name is on a list.  You are naive if you for any moment thought this was not the case.  It isn't right but it is reality.  Hopefully in the long run we are moving to a system which is more open and free.  We aren't there yet, hopefully after the excesses of this current crack-down we will move on to a better status quo.  The whims of society and government tend to oscillate in a sine wave manner, from one extreme to the other.  The current trend is to a dark side, from a national government point of view.  They are going to do a lot of stupid things which will take some time to correct.  It is wrong and bad but I can't do much to stop it.  I can call or write my local elected representitives but they are trendiods which go along with current trends.

What is happening now is wrong.  I hope the lawyers get a hold of it and sue all involved and the elected officials which allowed it to happen are removed from office and also assume a financial liability.  I would like to berate your country for allowing such country bumpkins into such positions but I note the bumpkins at the Vancouver BC airport were taking the pins out of Remembrance day poppies.
It was a horrible idea but yet so very few realize the true magnitude of the darkness of this action.  Kinda like going back to an era of witch hunts except there was no test.
Your views are a touch strong.  I am disappointed you so quickly label me because my beliefs are less extreme than yours.  Kinda puts you in the same category as the country bumpkin National Guardsman in Maine don't you think?
In 1969 I was too far gone on the hormones of youth and other distractions to notice much.  By the early 70s the takeover of India by the British was my cause.  The British were a bunch of bastards and they conquered a society for basically economic gain.  I was wrong in being overly critical of such actions as they are just part of the evolution of man's society, one society is always overcoming another society.  We can't feel guilt for the actions of previous generations long since passed away.
Where do we draw the line?  To me it is obvious Japanese North Americans should have been compensated for any loss of property or better yet it should not have happened.  What about the evil deeds of the US government against the American Indians?  Yes, the society of the day screwed those people out of their land.  Should our guilt extend that far back or should we have a limitation on guilt similar to your suggestion of a 50 year rule on art pieces.
The interpretation of the American Constitution is very much based on current standards.  There are some long term redeeming values but much is based on current standards.  At one point in America the circulation of currency was restricted to keep the masses in their place.  Look into the burned over region of New York.  During Hoover's time in the FBI the Mafia was denied and homosexuals were persecuted and now we are told Hoover was most likely a I don't see a great difference between America  during Hoover's time and some of the Asian authoritarian governments of today.  The point being most societies are in a constant state of change and hopefully the change is in a position direction.

Yes, you are right, she was searching for attention but she received more than she bargined for.  The point is how did the front line grunt know who to abuse?  Obviously there was a bit of a conspiracy here, don't you think?
Now this bitch may have deserved it but who is making the decision and what is the basis for that decision?  It may appear deserved until you are the target, then your thoughts change a bit.  Obviously you have never been a target before and been put thought the usual grinding.  I don't like liberal tree hugger types and rarely feel for them but if they restrict her travel privilages what is to stop them from picking on you?
You may think you are bullet proof but until you actually experience being a target it is difficult to understand the sense of violation one experiences when one is done over by a system.

I don't really like the "greens" type of person as they tend to blame every thing on me and my desire to be like an average person with average consumption of our worldly resources but why exactly should they be targeted for special treatment over other travellers who may be more astute in voicing their beliefs?
The decision to permit travel should be a matter of policy and not determined by individuals based on their personal beliefs or attitudes.  I have experienced this type of treatment in third-world countries where the person making the determination could be influenced by monetary issues.  I have always visited places where the degree  of hassle was determined by spiritual specifics, ie - Ring a bell here?  Green bad, Republican good, Christian good, Muslim bad?, or the other way round!!  It would be very sad if America was to become this shallow!

What am I missing here?  Was the prospective passenger carrying weapons or anything which could be judged as a weapon.?  Was the prospective passenger deemed a threat to any of the other passengers or the completion of the flight to its destination?  If the answers to any of the above questions were yes then the person should have been arrested, charged and dealt with in a court of law.
Otherwise the passenger should have been allowed on the flight regardless of political belief or profile of ticket purchase.  The ticket purchaser has suffered discrimation and should be able to seek damages.  Or, has ther hassling of citizens become a normal event?
If you start to agree to this type of decision you are no different than the Muslims who claim all non-believers to be an enemy.  Think about it!

I understand this.  Point is traveller shouldn't be denied travel unless there is something which dictates they are in some way a bad person which at that point they should be arrested or advised to remedy an ID problem.  If a group was to persist in such behavior they be open to a class action lawsuit.

Maybe simple but a legal way of looking at it which must form the basis of dealing with such situations
Attitude is a very scary principal to which base passage.  If this is truly the case I smell massive lawsuits down the road once the perceived threat retreats.
The airline or airport authority would lose this one in a trial.

Probably because the passengers and crew never thought they were in any serious danger as historically there has been no similar suicide hijackings in the US.  No one knew with certainty they were going to die.  If they knew they were going to die they may have fought back.
My guess would be if a similar attack was tried next week the passengers would fight back as they don't have much to lose.  But then, we are trained by our government and law enforcement not to take matters into our own hands as only the proper authorities can act appropriately.
Listening to the news reports it has been noted many times there was a failure in intelligence gatherings and more resources, read more money and less personal freedom, will be required to counter such threats in the future.  It was also mentioned that a simple terrorist group would be incapable of mounting such an attack.
There is no reason a group could not organize such a project with a week's notice once you know airport security is going to let you pass with pocket knifes and cardboard box cutters.  Bully the stewardess, break down the door to the cockpit, get the pilot to turn around and point the aircraft in the right direction, once you see your destination chase the flight crew away (craft would not be on autopilot) and steer the craft to the target.  The plane targeting the Pentagon apparently hit the ground before hitting the structure, almost a failure to achieve its target.  The aircraft crashing in PA totally missed its target.
I don't see where only a terrorist group backed by the resources of a national government could pull this off.  A week or two for planning and a group of people who can keep their mouth's shut plus the most important quality, big gonads and a desire to die for a perceived purpose.
My guess would be that the final analysis will show these terrorists were more lucky then skilful.  They were lucky to get past airport security, or airport security was that bad (what do you expect when you use near minimum wage labor with no leadership, vision or goals), they were lucky the passengers never fought back, they were lucky the weather allowed great visibility, they were lucky the cockpit is not secure and they were pretty lucky in hitting their Unfortunately the American people are the unlucky ones, paying the price in pain and suffering, increased taxation and the probable loss of freedom the government solution will entail.
I don't know if having a plane load of armed angry drunks crammed into inadequate seating with surly cabin staff is a viable solution.  Having a citizenry which is willing to question authority and willing to act accordingly in crisis situations would help but would probably offend the powers that be.

@_subject: Alert! Congress to target "TOXIC MOLD!" 
In the past, long ago, humans lived in caves and holes in the ground, at least in some places.  Mole and bacteria were pretty common and humans survived.  If you are born into an environment where "mold" and "spores" are common you build-up a resistance early in life.  In recent years the American consumer has been assaulted with vendors selling anti-bacterial and anti-mold solutions which promise a healthy environment. I question the soundness of attempting to sanitize our environment to the point where there is limited exposure to bacteria and molds.  I notice a lot more kids with allergies and environmental sensitivities than I remember as a youth and if I manage to visit the home of these kids I notice the home is usually very clean.  The point here is providing an ultra clean environment for young children may not be the best way to prepare them for a life in a world with various life forms, read mold and bacteria, attempting to use you as a host.
Not entirely true.  I live on the west coast of Canada in what is basically a temperate rain forest 6 to 8 months of the year.  Most modern paints have anti-fungal ingredients, or they are just poison to begin with, and generally resist mold for a number of years.  When the paint gets old and there is humidity there will be mold.  With new paint and lots of humidity there will be mold in no time.
A few years ago the Canadian federal gov't tightened building regulations to require new construction to have a double envelope.  Basically the walls are sealed on the outside and sealed on the inside.  Great idea for most of Canada which is cold and dry but questionable in a temperate rain forest.
Now add to this municipal gov'ts who in an attempt to maximize property taxes and development charges decide to tax on the square footage covered by the eves rather than the interior square footage and the problem grows.  Developers build with no eves and the building walls, outside envelope, are subject to the full force of the weather, which is mainly liquid.
The authorities responsible for building inspections fall down badly and only go through the motions.  Since it is warm enough to work year round, even though it rains 6 to 8 months a year, the builders work year round.  They frame the walls in the rain and even though they put a roof on the structure they will seal the wet wood framing on both sides.
The end result are buildings with significant moisture leakage and mold.  The problem is not so bad with single family dwellings as the eves tend to keep the weather off the walls, or so it is commonly thought.  Multi-family dwellings are hit big time.  They call it the Leaky Condo Crisis and virtually every multi-family building constructed in the last 5 to 8 years has the problem.
It is very common to find the inside structure of walls black with mold.  I can see the discoloured wood as I pass by.  These are not low-end dwellings.  Occupants of these Leaky Condos are complaining of mold related health issues.  They are finding many condos in Seattle are suffering from similar problems.
Older low-end construction doesn't tend to have a problem as there is no sealed envelope, never mind double sealed envelope, and the walls tend to breath and any moisture dries out in the summer.
