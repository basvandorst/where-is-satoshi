Well not with java ...? Any keylogger would catch what you type; or
any mouse-logger could catch what you click.
You could either attempt to remove/bypass keyloggers with a
lower-level language, or type in code.

It's interesting really.
Assuming one _did_ use some form of dual-key encryption such that key
a produces the real data, key b produces useless random noise, would
the feds smarten up such that they will analyse the decrypted result,
and, if they decide it's useless, force you to give up another key?
What if there were an N-Key system that (i.e. maybe OTP) where any
given key could give any given plaintext. Maybe they would force you
to try keys until they got a result they liked?
Is such a scenario possible?

Damnit man, if you're sending illegal things by email, at least encrypt it!

Sorry to double-post, but does anyone think Tor + encryption use
would've saved this guy?
I think encryption of the emails + hard drives would certainly help;
but would he be "coerced" into giving up the key? Could be burn the
key and deny everything? Would the FBI attempt to crack the key? Can
the FBI find you on Tor?
very interesting ...

@_subject: prove it isn't ... 
i was just wondering ... has anyone considered a time where the
governments will declare all encrypted blocks to contain messages
about illegal activities. that is to say, if you encrypt your
emails/communications, and the government wants to know the contents,
or use it against you, they will declare it to contain whatever they
want. it will then be up to you to prove it _doesn't_ contain this.
 how can we defend against this? deniable encryption? pretend the
block isn't encrypted at all, but that it is random data, or some
other type of content (data for a maths project, etc)?
 is it forseable that this will happen (in any given country)? i think
so. i think it already happens in some forms elsewhere. i.e. illegal
money. "prove this money came from valid resources, otherwise it's
illegal". i know that happens in australia already.

@_subject: Brands signature revisited :-) 
It is really intesting that there is a real exchange for this game,
but trading game-gold and so on for real world money is surely nothing
new. Ebay does it all the time.
Surely it'll regulate itself. As in, if it becomes easy to print money
inside the game, the money will just be less valuable. People will pay
less real money for it.
I probably need to sit down and come up with a real reply to this ...
but I'm just wondering how this is so different from any external
trading that almost all online games have [obviously the exchange is
one factor...].

ok, but that doesn't change the fact that this article is about some

it's funny he tries to suggest that something accepts random inputs
isn't an algorithm. umm what? where did he come up with that? the
world excepts 'random' inputs [us] and functions according to laws

i'm sure everyone one this list knows about customizegoogle, which you
can use to always go in the ssl gmail,
(the default install requires tweaking to get rid of ad's, etc).
i have doubts about it's anonymized cookie implementation, as i do
notice i remain logged in when i browse all my google services.
for me, i think google's very goal [organising information] goes
against any appropriate privacy implementation [or at least, that's
how they act].
they need to build privacy into their overall mission-statement.

@_subject: hard to top this bullshit 
I guess this is the obvious question/comment but I'll make it anyway:
Why would they do this? It makes not much sense, hiding illegal things
in equally illegal things.
It's like hiding marijuana inside cocaine ...
I mean I could see the point if one medium was slightly less legal
(like, say, pirated mp3's) but KP has got to be on par with terrorism

Neither are relevant either. Solutions are obvious. The point is that
checks are unsafe, and the public - and banks - need examples like
this to consider acting.

I agree, but I think it's highlighting an underlying issue that we've
been letting the wrong sort of people on the internet for a long time.
I tend to think that if this type of people ends up sticking to the
world of twitter and facebook and co, then we can safely caution them
off and just ignore them at large, so for that purpose it works well

I think this is trivially possible with, well, just the twitter rss
feeds. But, with yahoo pipes you make *them* follow the rss feeds, and
you watch the output of that. In that way, you aren't directly linked
to them, yahoo is, and they'd need to follow the pipe and see who owns
it/visits it. But if you make it public, it's visitable by anyone. And
I don't think yahoo requires any personal info.
Of course, the idea with the pipes is that you could forward the data
around a bit, munge it, mix it in with some other services, perhaps
encrypt or what-not. But I've not gone to town on what is available
with them.
Are you thinking specifically about the request for info on Wikileaks
followers? If you just follow the public RSS of that twitter account
(assuming it is public) surely they don't have any info on you,
because you haven't had to join twitter to do that. I must admit, I
don't have much of an idea of how twitter handles that stuff, as I
haven't used it for a few years.

Subscribing, though, only takes place on the readers side. That is,
it's just as if you were visiting it anyway. So, just don't subscribe,
and view it every so often. What you need, though, is some strategy
that means if the attacker visits the same rss feed, then they don't
get the same information. Or, the information they get is not useful
to them. So, you need some sort of encoding yahoo pipe as well. But
that's probably possible.
