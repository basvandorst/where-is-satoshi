ANTI SPAM policy - We dislike mail-spam as much as you do !!!!
So we did not buy one of the many available "tons-of-e-mail"-lists. We initiated a browse on the Internet for prospects.
We found your e-mail address while browsing the Internet for sites where the keywords distribution import and trade were present. We may have read your web presence wrong, thus added your e-mail to our marketing file by error. We also included more e-mails from the same company (domain) as it may have been difficult to decide on whom to approach.
In either case, please reply to this e-mail and put the word "error" in the subject line, then we will provide you with the search link to the web-URL where we found your mail, and delete you from our file.
