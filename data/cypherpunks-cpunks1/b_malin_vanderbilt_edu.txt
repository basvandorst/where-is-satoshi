Hi Dave, remember a couple of years ago when you said you wanted to
and repeat RFIDs - apparently someone has built the system to it.
VeriChip's human-implatable RFID chips clonable, sez hackers

In case anyone needed more proof that we're all living in a Philip K.
novel, a pair of hackers have recently demonstrated how human-
RFID chips from VeriChip can be easily cloned, effectively stealing the
person's identity. Annalee Newitz and Jonathan Westhues showed off their
handiwork at the HOPE Number Six conference in New York City this
with Newitz herself playing the role of guinea pig, implanting a
RFID chip in her right arm. To clone the chip, Westhues first red
arm with a standard RFID reader, then scanned it again with a homebrew
antenna connected to his laptop, which recorded the signal off the
chip. He
then used the same RFID reader to read the signal from his laptop, which
promptly spit out Newtiz's supposedly unique ID. For its part,
VeriChip has
only said they haven't yet had a chance to review the evidence but still
insist that "it's very difficult to steal a VeriChip."

STUDENT BUSTED FOR TAKING COP PICTURES
Friday, July 28, 2006 - FreeMarketNews.com
A Penn State college senior was arrested after he pointed his camera
phone at police activity in his neighborhood. A Philadelphia NBC News
Channel 10 report says the family of Neftaly Cruz, 21, is claiming
the cops
had "no right to come onto their property and arrest their 21-year-
old son
simply because he was using his cell phone's camera."
The charge against Cruz was based on a new law, allegedly prohibiting
from taking pictures of police officers with cell phones. Cruz is
quoted as
saying, "They threatened to charge me with conspiracy, impeding an
investigation, obstruction of a investigation..." Larry Frankel of
the local
ACLU chapter, reportedly said, "There is no law that prevents people
taking pictures of what anybody can see on the street," adding that,
rather scary that in this country you could actually be taken down to
headquarters for taking a picture on your cell phone of activities
that are
clearly visible on the street." - ST
