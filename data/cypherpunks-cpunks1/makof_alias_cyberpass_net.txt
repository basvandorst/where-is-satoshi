@_subject: Steganography -- Tell Tale Signs? 
Hi there!
I'd appreciate some help from you experts in 1) If I hide some PGP encrypted data in a
gif, jpg or wav file will there be any tell tale signs to the naked eye of an expert? If yes,
what are they?
2) Would it better to hide the data in a jpg with black and white image rather
than a color one?
3) Are there any tools at the moment to expose (not crack) the hidden encrypted data? If none. are there tools in development?
If this is off-topic please accept my apologies. and if necessary, please email replies to me directly. Thank you.

@_subject: Winsock Remailer Ver 1.3 -- Help! 
It could receive message but not remail. What could be the problem?
A sample of the Statistics Table is as follows:
Messages remailed      0
Messages discarded    3
Messages received    10
Other particulars are:
1) Pool set as 3 for light traffic
2) POP 3 working fine in other email applications.
3) Platform is Windows 3.1
Some Questions:
1) What should be the entries in the PGP Options dialogue box?
2) Do I have to create separate public and secret keyrings for the remailer?
Would apprecaite any help.
