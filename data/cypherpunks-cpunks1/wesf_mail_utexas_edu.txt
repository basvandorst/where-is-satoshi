As I understand it, Mondex is a completely closed system. Everything that you don't absolutely need to know is undocumented. Since you can settle offline, the potential for fraud is frightening; unless I'm getting the benefit of these, um, weaknesses in the system, I don't want there to be any. The lack of privacy seems to be somewhat of a smokescreen; since you can settle offline, they don't have a really accurate way of tracking transactions except at the interface between e$ and other forms of money or goods (like their POS terminals and ATMs).
Can you hack Mondex? They say you can't...

Unless you take it to mean that banner ads are important for "emerging Web commerce models" which is what PGP doesn't want to hinder the development of, in which case I'd say that IFF is inimical indeed. Both ways, they lose.
