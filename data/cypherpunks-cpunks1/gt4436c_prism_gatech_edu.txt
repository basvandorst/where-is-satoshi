Thanks to the Olympics, Georgia Tech now has 100% Ethernet availability
in its dormitories.  Currently the system utilizes a fiber-optic campus backbone
with network hardware in each building providing a 10BaseT port to each
student.  Work is underway to install ATM hardware and upgrade ports to
100Mb/s networking technology.

Build 1381 is the final release of NT 4.0, not a beta version.  Build 1381 was
released to OEMs about a week and a half ago.  It should reach a retail outlet
near you before September.
There is no free upgrade from the beta version of NT 4.0 to the final version.
You may want to purchase a copy from Microsoft, or sit in IRC for a while and
wait for someone to hand it to you.

First, to answer your question, I think the posts tarnish the
reputation of Anonymous, although there never was much
reputation to begin with.  I am of the opinion that a positive reputation is earned, not given, and arguing over the matter
at hand certainly doesn't help build a positive reputation.
Since these annoying posts started a week or so ago, I have
(for the first time ever) begun killfiling people and messages
on the cp list.  Right now I am killing all messages from John Anonymous MacDonald, Dmitri Vulis, and any message
in the "daily ... regarding TCM" thread(s).  I hope this madness
can end, so we can get back to more normal traffic levels on the
If anything good can come of this, it's that more people (myself
included) will begin to use filtering tools to improve the perceived S/N ratio of the list.  I am working on making a Eudora Pro
plugin that creates and maintains a reputation system, which can then be tailored to modify incoming mail as desired, removing
irrelevant paragraphs, summarizing, all kinds of things.  Initially
it will just keep an index score for each user representing the
quality of the content which they author, but I have lots of things
I hope to add to it.
Good luck with the survey,
