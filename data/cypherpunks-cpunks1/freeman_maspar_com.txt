Since it is quite easy to make an electronic widget that creates random
noise by amplifying up shot noise and counting detections across a threshold
(varying the amplifier gain to adjust the rate), I suspect you are right.

@_subject: Need Suggestions for Random Numbers 
Try using consecutive calls to your random-number generator to
generate two-dimensional coordinate pairs, and plot them.  That is,
you do something like:
     for( i = 0; i < LOTS; ++i ) {
        x[i] = rand();
        y[i] = rand();
        }
     for( i = 0; i < LOTS; ++i ) {
        plot_point( x[i], y[i] );
        }
It's surprising how fast this will demolish many psuedorandom
generators (and how good the eye is at pulling patterns out of plots).
  And as far as nominal sources of "white" noise, be careful to avoid
contamination from 60-cycle power-line noise and its harmonics.  Do
a Fourier transform and look for peaks, for sure.
  I'm sure that the pros know lots of tricks like this.

@_subject: Warning about exposing anon id 
A very interesting warning, and an interesting conceptual loophole, if I
understand it correctly.  What I think I understand is, that if I reply
to an anonymous message, the remailer will create and maintain an anonymous
ID for me, of the form "an12345", which it will use for all subsequent
messages that I send through it.
If so, then the gotcha is this:  Suppose I am not interested in anonymity.
I read a message that looks interesting, and reply to it -- both to the
originator and to the newsgroup.  The remailer gives me an "anonymous" ID
which is promptly compromised because the same text went out both with
my name on it and with the anonymous ID attached.  But who cares -- as
I stipulated, at the time I was not interested in anonymity, and may not
even have realized that the message I was replying to was posted via an
anonymous remailer.
BUT suppose that six months from now I suddenly turn paranoid (or realist --
which term you choose depends on your world view), and decide I would like
to use the anonymous mailer.  Now I send messages to and through it, but
the mailer already has an "anonymous" ID for me -- the one long since
compromised -- so it keeps using it.
Sounds to me like an interesting way for a user to compromise anonymity
without it really being anybody's fault.  I hope this problem is
explained in the remailer documentation (which I haven't sent for -- at
the moment I am not interested in anonymity), and that there is an
easy way for a user to request a new anonymous ID.
A fair fraction of the readers of this list will probably be saying
"caveat emptor" or words to that effect, but I suggest that it would be
a desirable property of a service offering any kind of anonymity, to
lead users -- especially novices -- away from trivial beginner's mistakes.

@_subject: Digital noise 
When I was in graduate school, a colleague built a gadget based on this
principle as a source of Poisson-distributed pulses for testing the
post-detector electronics of X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet astronomical
instruments.  I don't remember the precise source of the noise, but it
was similar to the "zener" trick cited in that it was based on quantum
phenomena rather than a mathematical generator.  The idea was to get
random pulses of varying amplitudes, amplify them up and use only those
bigger than a threshold to generate output pulses.  The instrument
also averaged the output rate and used it via feedback to adjust the
amplifier, so as to obtain a desired average rate of outputs.
I think that for a while at least there was a commercial random-noise
generator available that used this principle, though I don't remember
whose (and it's been long enough that it probably doesn't matter).
Try scientific-instrument catalogs, et cetera.

                Then they came for me,

Patrick May says:
  A fascinating point!  Perhaps Clipper's accomplishment will ultimately be
positive, serving to inculcate upon us all the habit and administrative forms
of routine use of cryptography, albeit in flawed implementation.  Thus when
the algorithm is unraveled, the transition to widespread use of a more nearly
adequate cryptographic standard may well be very rapid indeed.

Keith Henson comments on the realities of obtaining subpoenas and wiretaps:
    I cannot help but note that if persons of good will should choose to
attempt to improve the uniformity and correctness of application of law to
circumstances such as those Keith mentions, a well-written expert system
with a friendly user interface might be part of the solution.
    (This observation is a little borderline for cypherpunks but it does
in principle involve writing code...)

Also useful would be a Clipper in-circuit emulator -- a pin-compatible
head connected by cable to the computer of your choice, where you could
do whatever you wanted to the data, in software of your choice.  I suspect
that such a device is relatively easy to construct.  It could even have a
real Clipper inside it (possibly the one you took out of your 'phone), for
use when you wanted to pretend to be doing what the powers that be wanted
you to do.
