One thing we need to remember is that life, not just school,
is full of boring, repetitive tasks, even for the hi & mity.
You have to figure out how to do them.  This is one very difficult
*lifetime* problem for those with add-like behaviors.  Also, add
people need credentials & good jobs like everyone else, so they
have to be able to perform well enuf in school to get good recs
& good marks in subjects that interest them.  They didn't make this
system, but they do have to adapt to it somewhat.

So?  I hate to be flip, but is there a coffee shortage in your area?
Stimulants don't have the same effect on everybody.  "Normal" people
who take stimulants tend to act a lot like untreated hyperactives:
jittery, unfocussed, irritable.  Your point about long term use
is well taken, many people find the positive effects wear down after
a while.  Sometimes this is alrite, because in the meantime they
have been able to learn coping strategies they were unable to learn
before.  Sometimes it is not alrite, because their problems are too
severe, & they need other treatment.

Maybe, but consider that they are unable to focus properly on any
activity.  Revolution requires long term focus & unusually good
organizational skills, both are weak in add types.  It's a serious question, no doubt about it.
Well, for the add child, they don't get a proper education by any
measure, no matter what their symptoms are, without some kind of
treatment.  This does not necessarily include drugs, of course, but
some appear to benefit from it.  For the class, a hyperactive student

There are certainly legitimate arguments about the level of use of
Ritalin or other drugs, their benefits & their costs, but this straw
man is just ridiculous, & betrays the author's lack of knowledge.
Unfortunately a similar misunderstanding is reflected in the writings
of 1 or 2 others on this topic too.
Parental (or other) control is not at issue at all with add; self
control is the main problem.

These are not the people who are being talked about here
Well, like I said earlier, in the old days very hyperactive boys probably did have the tar whipped out of them.  This does work,
for short periods.   In the long run, it's ineffective.  Totally
ineffective for a medical condition.  Do you think, for example,
that it is effective to tell a person suffering from depression
to "cheer up", or someone suffering from some forms of schizophrenia
to "ignore the voices & stop acting silly"?  No amount of your cajoling
is going to get a person with a heart deficiency up El Capitan, & there's no chance you can guilt trip someone with severe emphysema to run
a marathon with you.
I'm sure there's plenty of misdiagnoses, but unless you're willing
to lay your md or your epidemiological credentials on the table,
I'm not giving you any credit.  Your argument sounds like some kind
of reactionary victorian moralizing to me (parents setting boundaries
.... sheesh).

Good argument, but I think you're still paying more.
Some have made the argument that the cost of manufacture of a CD is less (I wouldn't know).  Most people pay considerably
more taxes for that new platter, too. Sales tax is 6% or more now,
was 2-3% then for most people, other taxes have gone way up too.  You
probably had to earn $28 to bring home that $16 cd.

I thought that, for the most part, the telegraph systems described
above were to reduce cable charges (1 code word instead of a 15-word
sentence, a huge savings in those days).  Maybe it's the use to which
the encoding's put that's controversial, not the (idea of) encoding

Anyone who can read, should not have any problem figuring out that
I never made anything resembling the "point" ascribed to me.
There is certainly no point in carrying on a discussion with
someone who makes false attributions like this.
I could care less what language the people around me speak, but
it would be a more civilized world if they took care to tone
up their reasoning.  And when they need to resort to lies like
this to shore up their arguments, tar & feather 'em.

I don't really disagree with the conclusions drawn by this poster, or
with the quasi-economics argument he makes.  However, I must say that
the above is completely wrong.  MOST Americans live in large urban
areas, & as such are within seconds/footsteps of people whose native
languages are not English (or who don't have a single "native language",
but several!).  There are probably _hundreds_ of languages spoken in the
San Francisco Bay Area.  The school districts here routinely report double
digit languages in the school age population.
There are 3 Spanish language channels (& another 2 ... "multiple
choice") on my tv cable system.  That anglophones choose to tune them
out, or to not even notice the Noah's ark around them, says something
about this culture.

Well, it's a special case of security by obscurity, isn't it?
If the language is something unusual, maybe that helps, but
if the language is too obscure, you may be identified
(by your ethnicity, your history, or your friends/community) as
a speaker of it.  I guess it does raise the economic cost
of "decipherment" some.  But many immigrant parents have learned
to their embarrassment that this kind of encoding doesn't
work too well %^)
The Navajo/Na Dene codetalkers (WW II) developed a real arcane jargon,
so I was told.  Maybe it was because the conditions of war were
completely different than their language's environment so they
were forced to invent words, or maybe they thought it was a good
idea, or whatever.  But I believe transcripts of their transmissions
are often mostly unintelligible to native Navajo speakers who weren't in
the know.

Maybe; & who someone talks to & how they do it is of no particular
interest to me.  However, he said something else: that foreign
language speakers were unavailable to most Americans.  This is easily
shown to be false.  That many other people in our English-speaking
community also believe it is interesting.  Often, they can provide
counterexamples themselves without too much trouble (& you may recall
that Tim May did).  This says something about this culture.  What, I don't
know, but it's some kind of cognitive dissonance.
It occurs to me that members of certain large language groups
in the US, who don't speak English, sometimes make the same
statement -- "Everyone I want to talk to speaks X".
I don't know why this disclaimer is necessary, but please note that I
don't think for a moment that you all are "bad" if your beliefs are in
accord with what Tim May wrote.  Nor do I think you should
go out & learn some random language.
I'm not sure what the "second statement" is you're referring to.
Anyway, there are a lot of reasons one might choose to study
a foreign language, and many levels of fluency.  There are many
economic issues that could apply, & some non - economic arguments
as well.  There are very good reasons not to bother, as well.
