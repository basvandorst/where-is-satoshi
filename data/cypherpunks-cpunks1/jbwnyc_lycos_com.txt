Reuter's reported that after the initial order keeping the precincts in question open until 10:00PM CST that the Republican party went to the US Court of Appeals and got an order closing the polls down at 8:00 PM CST, one hour later than they were supposed to close.  I saw the story on Yahoo and it is presumably on others as well since Reuter's is the source.
 If Ashcroft does lose becsuse of this it raises the interesting question of who do you concede to when the opponent is a dead man? On Tue, 7 Nov 2000 23:08:58   Get FREE Email/Voicemail with 15MB at Lycos Communications at

On Wed, 8 Nov 2000 11:28:25   The electoral college vote you are thinking of was in the 1976 election, a Republican elector from Virginia cast his vote in the electoral college for McBride who was the Libertarian candidate that election.  The elector was not a very popular guy with the Republican party but he broke no law.  Jim Windle

On Wed, 8 Nov 2000 20:36:04   Interesting.  That may be right I remember it happening as I grew up in Virginia but I was pretty sure it must have been 1976 as I didn't think I remembered much about 1972 except Nixon won as I wasn't even a teenager.  A little research didn't help regarding that vote, but there are several other instances of electors voting for other candidates as the elector are not apparently legally bond to vote as they are elected to vote.
1956 An Alabama elector voted for a circuit court judge instead of Adlai Stevenson
1960 An Oklahoma elector voted for Harry F. Byrd instead of Richard Nixon
1968 A North Carolina elector voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon
1988 A West Virginia elector voted for Lloyd Bentsen instead of Michael Dukakis

While agreeing about the rights of property owners, many of the newly build or renovated ballparks have either been financed with municipal bond offerings making the government a creditor of the team or are owned by municipalities and leased to the teams and thus not even nominally private property. For instance here in New York the issue of where the Yankees will play in the future involves the governor, the mayor and the borough presidents of the Bronx and Manhattan as the current stadium is owned by the city as a result of the last renovation and the proposed new stadium on the upper west side would be paid for partially with tax free municipal bonds and partially by the state, owned by the city and leased to the Yankees at a concessional rate.  Though I don't have  the facts about all the stadiums built or renovated in the last decade or so, I think this is pretty standard stuff.  Governments try to impose their rules on anyone who partakes of their largesse thus the own!
