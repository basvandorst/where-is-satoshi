@_subject: So. FL Cypherpunks Keysigning/Party 
Jim Ray (liberty at gate.net) announced a South Florida Cypherpunks meeting
for the night of Wednesday, November 29th at the Abbey Brewing Company on
South beach.
I am proposing that all cypherpunks planning on attending the meeting email
me their PGP key fingerprint between now and noon on the 29th.  I'll
collate them and print enough copies of the fingerprint checklist for all
who've announced that they're planning to attend.  At the meeting, you can
verify (or not, not my business, really) the fingerprints with the other
attendees.  Afterwards, we'll exchange keys via email and sign them at home
and mail them back to their owners.  I'll set up an email list so that each
person can email out their key once they've merged all the signatures.
Suggestions as to how to streamline this process are welcome.
For more information on the meeting, contact Jim at liberty at gate.net

@_subject: How to hold a key signing party? 
I've never attended a key signing party so I'd like to get some input on
the most effective way to run one.
What I have in mind is to have everyone who is planning on attending send
me their key and its fingerprint.  I'll collate the lot and print enough
copies of the list of names/fingerprints so that once everyone shows up,
each person can get a handout.  Everyone presents ID showing who they are
and reads off their fingerprint so the attendees can check them on their
handout.  Afterwards, I'll email all attendees the keys so they can sign
them and mail them back to me.  Once I receive the signed keys, I'll
redistribute them back to the owners & attendees.
This seems like a lot of work, which I don't mind, but if there is a more
efficient method, I'd like to know about it.

Each person at the party would confirm what their key signature was so the
other attendees could check their handout.  They then take the handout that
they have personally checked the key signatures on home with them so that
when they recieve the keys from yours truly they can compare the
fingerprint they get with the fingerprint the owner claimed for the key,
which they checked against the handout when they were at the party, yes?

@_subject: Scientology tries to break PGP - and 
Instead of stripping, how about adding an offset to the start and end of
the ciphertext to each encoded idea key.  This way, I can send text A to
key A, text B to key B, C to C and so on.  As long as the recipient and
I have agreed in advance on which key to use to exchange the real message,
who can say otherwise?  If code words are used in all the messages to
refer to any illegal acts, ("ship me 30 kilos of smack" might be a tad
incriminating) how can anything be proved even if the recipient is
compelled to divulge their key?
An added advantage to this scheme is that if properly used it should help
throw a monkey wrench into traffic analysis by the nosy.  If I regularly
exchange encrypted messages with several different recipients, I can
enclose a seperate plaintext for each, make one massive combined
cyphertext and send it to all of them.  The ones I have no instructions
or trade secrets for today will each receive "Ignore this message,"
followed by a randomly selected random number of fortunes or other random
data (so each message to be ignored will have different length different
plaintext to further thwart analysis).
This may be combined with stealth PGP headers to make it difficult for
LEAs to determine all recipients for the purpose of getting a subpeona
for their keys.

I'd like to see the Netscape RNG implemented as a plug-in, preferably
with sample source included to make it easier for other people to create

Once there was a published API for the RNG, other apps could use it as well.
I like the option of using a cypherpunks approved RNG.  No offense to
Netscape, but I'd feel a lot more comfortable using a RNG with say
Perry's signature or Matt Blaze's.

I'm interested in setting up a key-signing in the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale

Location is flexible, but the date isn't very - a friend of mine is going

of the 31st and he'd like to snag as many signatures on his key as possible.

@_subject: Scientologists may subpoena anonymous remailer records 
Sameer will certainly correct me if I'm wrong, but remailers like c2 store
an encrypted header that is a path through the remailer system.
Since each nesting level is encrypted to that level's remailer, the other
levels only know which remailer to pass the message along to.  If you
really want to be secure, run your own remailer so that nasty folk can't
tell which of the encrypted messages are for you, and which your machine is
passing along.  I'd have a seperate account that I used solely for pointing
these c2 style messages to that had a procmail setup that would add a copy
of each message to my real mailbox and generate a random garbage file that
was a random number of bytes smaller than the incoming mail and premail it
through the remailer chain until it hit a /dev/null address.  That way, for
every message that entered your remailer one would exit for the benefit of
any traffic analysts.  I'd also make sure that the c2 address passed
through my remailer at least twice.
I can't stand netscape's mailer and newsreader so I use Eudora Light and
just have netscape set to a bogus email address.

@_subject: Novel use of Usenet and remailers to mailbomb from luzskru@cpcnet.com 
Bear with me - original text follows all these quotes
Impossible is an awfully strong word.
If I was going to implement free digital stamps, I'd have a autoreply
daemon (stamps at remailer.com) that when sent a mail, would respond with X
number of valid stamps.  If you're going to trust me not to log my remailer
traffic, extending that trust to believing I won't log the stamp requests
shouldn't be that much of a stretch.
Alternatively, the stamp could consist of a unique-id, any unique-id,
working identically to Usenet message ids.  That way, the user can generate
his own stamps without being forced to trust the remailer operator not to
log them.
I prefer the second option as it has both greater anonymity and allows for
simple history file patching to the remailer.
Either way, if the stamps/message-ids are forced to be inside the encrypted
address block, mail-bombers can only get one message through.  Even if the
HNGs are instructed to add a stamp and re-encrypt the address block, when
the spam-o-grams start getting routed through the pre-packaged route,
they'll be stopped dead after one message gets through.

files.  And go ahead and keep a copy of all your assorted /var/named &

Honest officer, I keep that partition unmounted so that a system crash is
less likely to clobber my painfully constructed configuration files - and
it's encrypted so that crackers won't be able to alter my configuration
backup to add security holes.

This is easily done from a technical standpoint.  There is a set of patches
for the CERN server that lets you have it automatically delete
advertisments from certain prominent sites (used to be called NoShit, I
heard they changed the name) when you're running in proxy mode.  You can
even have it change profanity into "EXON EXON" on the fly.  Running
something like this is probably a good thing for the ISP as running a cache
will allow them to get more mileage out of their net connection.
However, I don't think it likely that many ISPs will go this route from a
liability point of view - if some parent is paying them to filter out smut,
and little Zippy finds a brand new x-rated site, chances are some irate
parent will sue them.  With the proliferation of new pages, it is
impossible for anyone to keep up, unless the authors voluntarily include
some smutscan codes in their pages.

In my experience (on a Mac) the Zip doesn't get any slower once protected

Linux would even blink before mounting the purportedly "protected" volume.
If you're concerned about securing your carts, I recommend creating a
CryptDisk file on the Mac disk.  I don't use DOS/Windows, so I can't
suggest anything for that, but I'm sure someone else on the list will jump
in.  Matt Blaze recently posted an announcement of a new release of his

Yes.  The same filter software that Exonizes the language could also
replace the whole html body with "Access Denied" if the ratings codes
aren't present.
CERN will already proxy gopher & ftp as well as http.  There is another
package, delegate, that will proxy nntp & telnet.  However, the main
problem with using proxies as a censorship tool is that nothing prevents
the client software from just not using the proxy.  By the time Zippy is
old enough to care about hunting down smut/bomb designs/drug formulae,
Zippy is a lot more likely to know how to do this than the parental units,
in a manner undetectable by the parent (invisible System Folder/Windows
directories with unsanitized browser prefs files comes immediately to mind
- now that 1GB drives are common, it isn't too difficult to hide them)
I agree, if you're going to bother with rating pages, digitally signing the
signature so that terrorist X can't just copy the "Good Clean Fun" rating
code into his Phosgene formula page is the only rational solution.
Gotta love that overhead, though.
