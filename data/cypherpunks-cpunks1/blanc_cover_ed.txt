@_subject: The Revolution is  NOW! (Think about it, Gertrude...over a Stein of beer, perhaps?) 
* What Goes Around, Comes Around:  Since taking control of
most of Afghanistan in September 1996, the religious Taliban army
has enforced strict, conservative Islamic rule, especially regarding
the work, recreation, and dress of women.  Now, according to a
report in the London Daily Telegraph in November, a splinter
Muslim group about 200 miles north of Kabul has begun to train a
women-only battalion to fight the Taliban.  Females from the
Hazaras, a Turkic Mongol ethnic group, have been training at a
secret location and will soon begin a major recruiting campaign.
