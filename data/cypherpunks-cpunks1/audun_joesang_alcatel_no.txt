Denmark has got a live system going on for a few years. It's called
DANMONT (with a slash through the "O") meaning litterally "Danish
coin". They gave a talk at Smart Card '93 at Wembley, London,  last
year and will give another talk at Smart Card '94 on Wednesday 16th
February this year. You can contact Jens Lindboe-Larsen or Annette
Falberg of DANMONT,or you can call the Wembley Exhibition organisers
on (tel)+44-733-394304 (fax)+44-733-390042.

@_subject: Surveillance Cameras 
Last year I experienced to be the victime of efficient CCTV (Closed Circuit
TV) surveillance in Bristol UK. My car was parked illegally and got towed
away. Later at the police car pound I was told that all the streets could
be seen through remote controlled zoom lens CCTV cameras mounted all
around town, which made them able to efficiently direct their towing trucks.
Somehow the equipment has to be payed off.

I used to be very uncertain, but now I'm not sure anymore.
