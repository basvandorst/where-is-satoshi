@_subject: [liberationtech] /. ITU Approves Deep Packet Inspection 
I would not limit your point to core networking. DPI technology is also used by
organizations at the networking edges to conduct censorship.
I agree that there is some legitimate use for DPI but giving up on that is a
small price to pay considering the mass surveillance and censorship which is
made so easy by DPI. Looking into packet payload should be considered taboo for
middle boxes. No matter where they are.
