@_subject: NEXT CHALLENGE: so, when does it start? 
Well, I've got the program, and I'm ready to start sweeping
(about 35,600 keys/sec on a P5  90 Mhz NT machine - have to see
how many I can draft for this) - I even compiled for Win 3.11 (less
than 800 keys/sec on a 486/33 - don't think I'll bother).
I've got the challenge file from Adam's messages.
But when do we start? Have we started already? Have we completed?
It's difficult to tell. There was talk of starting at 12:00GMT (about 6 AM here on the east coast), but there was no 'start now' message to the list. At Adam's site, I can see that 'project 11fa' has been completed, but the key (000000001234) looks like test data.
If I try to allocate keys, I get the 600 SLEEP 3600 message, which
suggests strongly  that the seach has not started yet.
Adam, when you fix a time to start the search, could you:
1. Send a message to the list, clearly saying so, and giving the 2. Put a headline in your page saying it's underway?

Mr Thomas, if you're listening, PLEASE tell us what's going on.
You've reserved 3/4 of the keyspace, and you're going to screw up the search unless you have an NSA-sized data center.

@_subject: SSL Challenge: some thoughts on the process. 
Well, the game's afoot, and I have a few preliminary thoughts on the 1. We need some protection against massive allocation of keys - perhaps an upper limit of a few hundred segments. Piete had better be ready to loop the server - at this rate FFFF will be allocated sometime tommorrow.
2. It'd be nice if the NT Winsock client could loop, reporting results and getting new keys automatically each time it finished a block. As it is, it's not worth my running it overnight. For each of the P5/90 NT machines I'm using, I'm manually running brutessl with enough key to keep them busy till morning. I'd rather have something that reported results to the server as it went along.
This is part of a more general problem. A lot of people are doing this on standalone machines at work, and have no way of checking them during the
night. This is doubly true for weekends - theretically if someone hits jackpot at 6pm on Friday, we might not find out till 9am Monday. I will not be running on any work machines over the weekend.
3. Start time was a little ragged - 1800 GMT was named, but the server seemed to come up at 2PM east coast time, which is (I think) 1900 GMT. I think that if we selected 8AM west coast time (1600 GMT?) more people would come online more quickly.
4. There was a massive crush of people trying to get keys from the server at 2. If we ever do this again, we might think about preallocating chunks of keyspace to people according to their promised cpu power, and keeping
the *challenge* a secret till the starting gun sounds. Passively serving a page with the challenge would load the server much less than the cgi-based
key doler.
5. We needed more pre-publicity on the Net to attract participants - a week would have been better than 24 hours. just some random thoughts....

Well, we're now about 30 hours into the crack, and here are some
very rough stats.
We've swept a bit over  1/4 of the keyspace. Only 60% of requests have been ACKed so far - PLEASE check to make sure your acks have
been recorded.
The largest segments completed are a 128 (mine), and 4 100's
(3 are mine :-) Over 9000 segments have been swept in 3-segment
chunks, by far the most popular size.
I count people from uk, at, se, ee, fr, ie, kr, nl, de, no, au, za, nz, fi, ca, be, is, and us, by a casual inspection - I'm sure there are more.
It's pretty clear that the server is the bottleneck, though also looks like some people are biting off more than they can chew. I would
have probably swept another couple hundred today if I could have
obtained the key space.
Since a lot of sweepers are not on the cpunk list, notices of
updates and progress would be well put in the /brute/ page.

Actually, I've been thinking about this quite a bit recently. I'm building
an SSL enabled server, and clent-side authentication may provide
some help. I could see a user getting his or her public key certificate
signed with different CA keys which assert any number of conditions,
such as:
Key holder was born before (some particular date).
Key holder has access to sales data for XYZ corp.
Key holder is an adult who takes the first amendment seriously.
... and the server would recognize different CA signatures as permitting
different levels of access.
If your browser permitted you to select the key certificate  used in setting up the encrypted link (and different certs or sets of certs
could be protected with different passphrases), then Mom or Dad
could use their I-am-an-adult credential to read while Junior could not. There *is* a loss of anonymity in this scheme,
I realize that digital credentials are old hat on this list. The point I am
making is that the pieces for doing this are here - we just need to
assemble them.

@_subject: Timing Cryptanalysis Attack 
Loathe as I am to disagree with Perry :-), is it really 'trivial' to take these timings in an online protocol? Paul writes on the DH example:
Note that the range is 1201 microseconds
and for RSA:
The range here is 17 microseconds.
Paul notes:
In a 'real' system, there is a lot of unpredictable variation
in the timing of the signal. Sources of such noise include
routers,  and other sessions on the server (any decent server these
days is multi-tasking, and can handle multiple connections simultaneously). On top of that, real protocols have a lot of
processing overhead, looking up certificates and keys, generating
MAC hash values, etc, many of which are difficult to predict.
I tried pinging some machines to look at the slop in the roundtrip
times. I have not checked traceroute, but for what it's worth,  I'm in central Massachusetts.
elnath (local to my lan)			<10 ms
rtfm.mit.edu (20 miles)			10-21 ms
iii1.iii.net (FreeBSD on a 120MHz P5, 35 miles)	100-200 ms
utopia.hacktic.nl (Netherlands)			190-781 ms
Maybe Paul can give us some figures as to how *much* random
noise is enough to make his (very elegant!) attack unfeasible. Note that the range of the random slop I'm getting is hundreds to thousands
of times the range of the signal he needs to detect. Statistical techniques, averaging the return times for the same text over many trials may be useful, but the number required to detect a less than 1% variation is going to be high.
The attack might be feasible of it can be mounted on a quiet server
from a point 'close' (in network terms) to the timing system, and the intervening network segments are also fairly quiet.  I don't think
random users are going to crack the Dilbert Store, however.

phones in the same area won't interfere by accident. It is not frequency agile - the same freq is used throughout the call.     It's a good phone - nice tone, long range, and it's secure
against jerks with scanners. Secure against serious eavesdroppers

Haven't had time to test this myself.
Peter Trei
------- Forwarded Message Follows -------
A potentially serious bug has just come to my attention concerning the
handling of password-protected pages accessed via Netscape 2.0b3.
Apparently when you type in the password to access a protected document
Netscape stores the password in a local hidden file (in one of the .db
files created in the .netscape directory on UNIX systems, and in the
Netscape Preferences file on Macintoshes).  This password is then used for
accessing the document during subsequent accesses.  The problem is that
Netscape does not delete the stored password when the program quits.
The problem has been reproduced on Unix and Macintosh platforms.  I haven't
tried the Windows implementation yet, but I suspect the same problem
This leads to the following behavior:
        1) Open up Netscape and access a password-protected document.
        2) Quit Netscape
        3) Start Netscape again and try to retrieve the document.  When the
                password-entry dialog comes up, click "Cancel".
        4) Try to access the document a second time.  Now Netscape lets you
                in without asking for the password!
On Unix systems, this means that if you go over to a associate's machine to
show him a protected document, Netscape will record your typed in password
for posterity.  Your associate now has full access to this page.
The situation is particularly dangerous on PCs in a shared "computer lab"
environment.  Everybody who uses Netscape unwittingly makes his passwords
available to all other users.
Please let me know if anyone finds out more about this problem.  I'm going
to add it to the WWW security FAQ.

"NSA provides necessary keying material for SSP3110 operation."
and "It is available to U.S. Government agencies, military organizations,  and defense contractors."
This is not a snake oil product ala "Power One Time Pad" (sic). It's

I've been trying to figure out the boundary conditions of the speech - what's the best and worst interpretations that can be placed upon it. I was not at the show.
Worst: Netscape will put GAK into every server and browser it sells or distributes.
Best: Out of context, misinterpreted quote, referring to the Fortezza support in the newest version of SSL. Fortezza (and the earlier, related Tessera) are PCMCIA cards with Clipper chips.
Clipper, as we know, *is* escrowed.
There's a lot of interest within the USG for using Web-based technologies for distributing information, some of it confidential. With a Fortezza-based laptop and
a Fortezza-enabled browser, a government employee  would be able to securely obtain text and graphics info while out in the field - for example, a social worker looking up
case histories while at a client's home, to choose a fairly uncontroversial example.
At a W3C meeting a few months ago, some NSA employees demoed a Tessera enabled Mosaic client and server. Netscape (and other SW companies) would like to sell to the USG - it's a big market.
Adding support for USG supported security systems expands that potential market.
Jeff, this does not let you or Netscape off of the hook. A *lot* of people are wondering just exactly what Jim was alluding to,. and would like to see a full, in-context quote.

ring, this policy has changed. It is now clear that the exportable version can be cracked, and probably will be cracked, with all the bad PR that entails. Both companies now plan to release export and
domestic versions.  (Some overseas sales are better than none, and not everyone needs or uses the cryptographic capabilities).

@_subject: VCRPLUS Huffman code 
It was partially broken a few years ago, and the results published in
Cryptologia. I have a xerox in a carton somewhere. The break was for codes up to 4or 5 digits long, if I recall - this covers
most of the major timeslots on the main stations. Longer codes
cover odd timeslots on less popular stations.
Code which implemented this partial crack was published on the net,
and the VCR+ people got very upset about it - apparently they make
money selling the codes to TV Guide and newspapers. It's protected
as a trade secret, not a patent.
It used a combination of lookup tables and Huffman codes, and
included a certain amount of obfuscation to resist cracking.

@_subject: CYPHERPUNK considered harmful. 
I mailed this yesterday, but it never showed up on the list.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
V Z Nuri has actually stolen my thunder a bit here, with his post on
'crypto confrontation', but I've been working on this stuff since
Friday. I have a somewhat different approach, and I'd like to see
some comment.
                  "CYPHERPUNK" considered harmful
     I would like to propose that we, the 'cypherpunks', are making a
strategic error, which will make it far more difficult to achieve the
goal we share.
     I realize that many will bridle at the notion that we have a common
goal, but I think that most of the participants in  this list will agree
with the following:
     "Strong cryptography is a powerful new technology, of which the
widespread and unfettered use should be encouraged."
     Our error lies in our approach to encouraging the widespread use of
crypto. It is an error of hubris - overweening pride.
     We too often think of ourselves as an elite - smarter and better in
various ways to our non-cpunk neighbours. We refer to these others as
'Joe Sixpack" and other such derogatary terms.      The problem is that in doing so we are marginalizing ourselves.      We call ourselves 'cypherpunks'. While this is derived from the SF
term 'cyberpunk', consider the image we are creating for ourselves:
     A 'punk' is a marginalized young adult, one who rejects the norms
of his or her society, and takes delight in irking those around him with
his or her rejection. The older of us will think of James Dean in 'Rebel
Without a Cause', or Brando in 'The Wild One'. Later, you get images
such as Peter Fonda in 'Easy Rider', and more recently, Sid Vicious and
other icons of the 'punk rock' movement.
    These punks are often romantic figures, but in reality they started
marginalized, remained marginalized, and died marginalized. They were
ineffective in changing the core values of the society in which they
lived (yes, I know that most the examples I've given are fictional characters, but I'm talking about the type of people they are modeled
    We, the 'cypherpunks' have embraced this label, taking pride in our
technical abilities, and acting as if we can institute 'cryptoanarchy'
without getting a majority of the population to support us.
    This is a bad approach. The overwhelming majority of the US
population is not alienated from the US government, and regards with
suspicion those who are.
     I suggest that we drop the term 'cypherpunk' - it has the wrong
connotations to get our ideas into the mainstream. I don't have a perfect replacement yet:
1. I want to get away from the strings 'crypt' and c[iy]pher- they sound
too cloak-and-dagger.
2. It should imply that the labelees are level-headed, responsible
citizens, not longhaired weirdos.
3. It should make itself difficult to invert - the classic example
is the pro-choice/pro-life dichotomy, where each side refuses to
acknowledge the other's terminology.
4. A cute and apropos acronym would help.
     Many on this list have been advocating cryptography primarily as a
means of liberating ourselves from an intrusive and overcontrolling
state. This is a goal that leaves most Americans cold - they correctly
regard their country as one of the most free in the world, and are
alarmed by people who want major changes in the status quo.
     To get crypto accepted into the mainstream, we need to make it
something the average person expects and wants to use, for goals
that make mainstream sense - not for some distant, idealist utopian
cryptoanarchic libertarian dream.
     Crime is a major political hot button these days. Advocating crypto for preventing crime is probably the best approach we have
to getting the meme into the mainstream's ear that "I need good

Namespace collisions seem to happen quite frequently in titles. I can remember when TMC made a big deal out their intention to air
'Brainstorm", the 1983 film with Natalie Wood. I settled down to
watch, and up came a black and white movie with a totally different
plot - it turned out they had been sent the 1965 film of that name,
and no one had checked. Looking in the (ex)Cardiff film database, I
note that there is now a 3rd movie of the title (1994).
A couple weeks ago my daughter was making a big deal about wanting to watch 'The Red Shoes" on Disney. I was thinking of
the 1948 ballet movie, and told her I didn't think she'd like it. She
insisted, and it turned out to be a 30 minute (and charming in
cloying sort of way) cartoon.

The Commerce server is significantly less vulnerable because:
1. Key pairs are generated only once
2. Access to the actual server is limited for hackers to try to guess with
some accurace when the key pair was generated.
3. The time it takes to generate key pairs is about 5 seconds on a
reasonably powerful UNIX machine.  4. Since the random number seed address space is 30 bits, even if one knew
approximately when the server key-pair was generated it only reduces this
dows to say 20 bits.  Therefore the operation can take anywhere from (2**20
to 2**30) * 5 seconds = 5 million to 5 billion seconds.
5 million seconds = 57.8 days
5 billion seconds = 158 years

@_subject: (Fwd) Internet  Euro-Clipper 
F Y I
from the RISKS DIGEST-----------
According to an article in `Communications Week International', the 34-nation Council of Europe has agreed to outlaw strong encryption products which do not make keys available to governments.
The article, `Euro-Clipper chip scheme proposed', is on the
front page of the magazine's issue 151, dated 18th September, which arrived in my mail this morning.
It relates that the policy was approved on the 8th September
at Strasbourg by the Council, and coincides with an attempt by the European Commission to propose a pan-European encryption standard. The Council - unlike the Commission - has no statutory powers to enforce its recommendations.
However, Peter Csonka, the chairman of the committee that
drafted the document (and an administrative officer at the Council's division of crime problems) says that `it is rare for countries to reject  Council of Europe recommendations'.
The proposal would make telecomms operators responsible for
decrypting traffic and supplying it to governments when asked. It would also `change national laws to enable judicial authorities to chase hackers across borders'.
Opposition to this measure was expressed by Mike Strezbek,
VP responsible for European telecomms at JP Morgan, who said that his organisation `will challenge any attempt to limit the power of our network encryption technologies very strongly'.
Czonka said that the Council had given consideration to
business interests but had tried to strike a balance between privacy and justice. However, `it remains possible that cryptography is available to the public which cannot
be deciphered,' his document says. `This might lead to the
conclusion to put restrictions on the possession, distribution, or use of cryptography.'
Apparently another international organisation, the OECD, has
called a conference of its members in December to devise a strategy on encryption.
I for one will be making clear to my MP that his stand on
this issue will determine how I cast my ballot at the next election. I note that John Major stated in a 1994 parliamentary written reply to David Shaw MP that the government did not intend to legislate on data encryption. I am disappointed that government policy has changed to the point of supporting the Council of Europe, and that this change has sneaked through during the parliamentary recess.

Well, we've pretty throughly convinced ourselves that Denning's scheme can be spoofed (I'm convinced, anyway.)
It's actually worse than useless - it's a substantial security breach.
     To spoof being at a location, Mallory needs to know the location he is trying to spoof.
With S/A off (as I understand it is now), he need to know the location within a couple
meters, in three dimensions.
     Such precise location data is usually difficult to obtain, without actually visiting the site and recording the location using GPS.  Mallory might be able to work out, for example,
the location of the desk in the Oval office to that precision by triangulation (though setting up theodolites on Massachusetts Avenue may attract some attention :-)
However, I defy him to find the location of a specific PC in NSA headquarters, or in a
secured communications facility  without actually visiting the desk
carrying a GPS receiver (which he won't be allowed to do, unless he's got a damn good reason).
     However, since the protocol requires that Alice send out location data, once
she starts using it she reveals her physical location to Eve, Mallory, and anyone ese
 who can see the packets. Since the nature of the protocol is that Alice's location does not  change frequently (and needs to transmitted  via a trusted channel to Bob when it
does), after the first usage Mallory  *knows* the physical location  he is trying to simulate, and can use this information for future spoofing.
     The upshot of this is that Denning's scheme not only provides no security against spoofing, and leaks potentially sensitive data about locations.      If Sadaam Huissain (sp?) had used this scheme during the Gulf War, we'd have been able to send a cruise missile directly to his keyboard.
[These flaws in the protocol seem so obvious that I can't help but wonder if we're missing something - Dorothy isn't *that* stupid.]

Ms Denning, Mr. MacDoran
I've read with interest your proposed GPS-based authentication mechanism (it was posted to the cypherpunks mailing list). Can you
confirm that you wrote this? Some people on the list think it may be
a forgery.
The participants of the list have noted some apparent vulnerabilities
in the system, and I am curious as to how you address them. If you
respond to me and give permission, I'll forward your response to the
The problems are two-fold:
1. The system is easily spoofed.
2. It leaks sensitive location data.
You say:
" The signature ... is formed from bandwidth compressed raw observations of all the GPS satellites in view."
" The location signature is virtually impossible to forge at the required accuracy. This is because the GPS observations at any given time are essentially unpredictable to high precision due to subtle satellite orbit perturbations, which are unknowable in real-time, and intentional signal instabilities  (dithering) imposed by the U.S. Department of Defense selective availability (SA)."
Could you substantiate this claim? Is there any reason a spoofer
could not do the following?
1. Set up a receiver near (within a 1000 miles or so) of the site he
is trying to spoof (he needs to be able to see roughly the same
satellites as the spoofed site).
2. Extract from the signal he receives the psudo-random sequence
sent from each satellite.
3. Buffer the sequence  from each satellite for a brief period (the extreme
case is 42 msec, the time it takes light to travel the diameter of the
4. Re-assemble the aggregate signal with the appropriate delays for the
location he is trying to spoof. These delays can be pre-computed.
5. Modulate a simulated 17 cm carrier appropriately to produce a synthesized signal, identical to that received at the location to be spoofed, and use
that to fake his location.
I note that there is commercially available test equipment to simulate
GPS satellites, which transmit a signal appropriate for any location you dial into them (btw, setting one of these up near a location using your
protocol  leads to an interesting denial-of-service attack, since you
can overwhelm the satellite signal with a false one giving a bogus
Even if the spoofer has to extract sequence data from the real satellites,
the storage requirement is not  onerous, since he already knows just
how long he has to delay each satellite's signal, and need buffer only
the appropriate chunk for each satellite.
While this *does* result in a slight delay while the sequence data for
each satellite is gathered, the extreme case is 42 ms. Internet
transmission delays on the order of 100 ms are common, so your
system will have to accept location data which is this old.
The computational load neccesary to spoof the signal is not excessive -
it's essentially the reverse of that used to extract location data from the
aggregate  signal, a process which is not a one-way function.
Thus, the signal can be spoofed.
Second, your system broadcasts potentially sensitive location data.
Your protocol will be a gold mine for the traffic analysts  The
data can be used for later spoofing attacks, or, in an operational situation, to target munitions.
While encrypting the link can protect this data, if you can use encryption,
you can also use digital signatures  for authentication.
Finally, GPS receivers don't work too well in steel-framed buildings. There are substantial shielding and multipath problems
( for your system to work, the antenna needs to be near
the originating node, not on the roof). You do not appear to address
these problems. Peter Trei

Location-based System Delivers User
Authentication Breakthrough
By Dorothy E. Denning and Peter F. MacDoran
Copyright(c), 1996 - Computer Security Institute - All Rights Reserved
Top - Help
Existing user authentication mechanisms are based on information the user
knows (e.g., password or PIN), possession of a device (e.g, access token or
crypto- card), or information derived from a personal characteristic
(biometrics). None of these methods are foolproof. Passwords and PINs are
often vulnerable to guessing, interception or brute force search. Devices
can be stolen. Biometrics can be vulnerable to interception and replay.
A new approach to authentication utilizes space geodetic methods to form a
time- dependent location signature that is virtually impossible to forge.
The signature is used to determine the location (latitude, longitude and
height) of a user attempting to access a system, and to reject access if the
site is not approved for that user. With location-based controls, a hacker
in Russia would be unableto log into a funds transfer system in the United
States while pretending to come from a bank in Argentina.
Location-based authentication can be used to control access to sensitive
systems, transactions or information. It would be a strong deterrent to many
potential intruders, who now hide behind the anonymity afforded by their
remote locations and fraudulent use of conventional authentication methods.
If the fraudulent actors were required to reveal their location in order to
gain access, their anonymity would be significantly eroded and their chances
of getting caught would increase.
Authentication through geodetic location has other benefits. It can be
continuous, thereby protecting against channel hijacking. It can be
transparent to the user. Unlike most other types of authentication
information, a user's location can serve as a common authenticator for all
systems the user accesses. These features make location-based authentication
a good technique to use in conjunction with single log-on. Another benefit
is there is no secret information to protect either at the host or user end.
If a user's authentication device is stolen, use of the device will not
compromise the system but only reveal the thief's location. A further
benefit of geodetic-derived location signatures is that they provide a
mechanism for implementing an electronic notary function. The notary could
attach a location signature to a document as proof that the document existed
at a particular location and instant in time.
The use of geographic location can supplement or complement other methods of
authentication, which are still useful when users at the same site have
separate accounts and privileges. Its added value is a high level of
assurance against intrusion from any unapproved location regardless of
whether the other methods have been compromised. In critical environments,
for example, military command and control, telephone switching, air traffic
control, and banking, this extra assurance could be extremely important in
order to avoid a potential catastrophe with reverberations far beyond the
individual system cracked.
How it works
International Series Research (Boulder, CO) has developed a technology for
achieving location-based authentication. Called CyberLocator, the technology
makes use of the microwave signals transmitted by the twenty-four satellite
constellation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Because the signals
are everywhere unique and constantly changing with the orbital motion of the
satellites, they can be used to create a location signature that is unique
to a particular place and time. The signature, which is computed by a
special GPS sensor connected to a small antenna, is formed from bandwidth
compressed raw observations of all the GPS satellites in view. As currently
implemented, the location signature changes every five milliseconds.
However, there are options to create a new signature every few microseconds.
When attempting to gain access to a host server, the remote client is
challenged to supply its current location signature. The signature is then
configured into packets and transferred to the host. The host, which is also
equipped with a GPS sensor, processes the client signature and its own
simultaneously acquired satellite signals to verify the client's location to
within an acceptable threshold (a few meters to centimeters, if required).
For two-way authentication, the reverse process would be performed. In the
current implementation, location signatures are 20,000 bytes. For continuous
authentication, an additional 20 bytes per second are transferred. Re-
authorization can be performed every few seconds or longer. The location
signature is virtually impossible to forge at the required accuracy. This is
because the GPS observations at any given time are essentially unpredictable
to high precision due to subtle satellite orbit perturbations, which are
unknowable in real-time, and intentional signal instabilities  (dithering)
imposed by the U.S. Department of Defense selective availability (SA)
security policy. Further, because a signature is invalid after five
milliseconds, the attacker cannot spoof the location by replaying an
intercepted signature, particularly when it is bound to the message (e.g.,
through a checksum or digital signature). Continuous authentication provides
further protection against such attacks.
Conventional (code correlating and differential) GPS receivers are not
suitable for location authentication because they compute latitude,
longitude and height directly from the GPS signals. Thus, anyone can report
an arbitrary set of coordinates and there is no way of knowing if the
coordinates were actually calculated by a GPS receiver at that location. A
hacker could intercept the coordinates transmitted by a legitimate user and
then replay those coordinates in order to gain entry. Typical code
correlating receivers, available to civilian users, are also limited to 100
meter accuracy. The CyberLocator sensors achieve meter (or better) accuracy
by employing differential GPS techniques at the host, which has access to
its own GPS signals as well as those of the client. DGPS methods attenuate
the satellite orbit errors and cancel SA dithering effects.
Where it works
Location-based authentication is ideal for protecting fixed sites. If a
company operates separate facilities, it could be used to restrict access or
sensitive transactions to clients located at those sites. For example, a
small (7 cm x 7 cm) GPS antenna might be placed on the rooftop of each
facility and connected by cable to a location signature sensor within the
building. The sensor, which would be connected to the site's local area
network, would authenticate the location of all users attempting to enter
the protected network. Whenever a user ventured outside the network, the
sensor would supply the site's location signature. Alternatively, rather
than using a single sensor, each user could be given a separate device,
programmed to provide a unique signature for that user. Location-based
authentication could facilitate telecommuting by countering the
vulnerabilities associated with remote access over dial-in lines and
Internet connections. All that would be needed is a reasonably unobstructed
view of the sky at the employee's home or remote office. Related application
environments include home banking, remote medical diagnosis and remote
process control. Although it is desirable for an antenna to be positioned
with full view of the sky, this is not always necessary. If the location and
environment are known in advance, then the antenna can be placed on a window
with only a limited view of the sky. The environment would be taken into
account when the signals are processed at the host.
For remote authentication to succeed, the client and host must be within
2,000 to 3,000 kilometers of each other so that their GPS sensors pick up
signals from some of the same satellites. By utilizing a few regionally
deployed location signature sensors (LSS), this reach can be extended to a
global basis. For example, suppose that a bank in Munich needs to conduct a
transaction with a bank in New York and that a London-based LSS provides a
bridge into Europe. Upon receiving the location signatures from London and
Munich, the New York bank can verify the location of the Munich bank
relative to the London LSS and the London LSS relative to its own location
in New York.
The technology is also applicable to mobile computing. In many situations,
it would be possible to know the general vicinity where an employee is
expected to be present and to use that information as a basis for
authentication. Even if the location cannot be known in advance, the mere
fact that remote users make their locations available will substantially
enhance their authenticity. In his new book, The Road Ahead, Bill Gates
predicts that wallet PCs, networked to the information highway, will have
built-in GPS receivers as navigational assistants. With the CyberLocator
technology, these PC receivers can also perform authentication while being a
factor of ten less expensive than conventional code correlating receivers
(most of the processing is executed in the host rather than the remote
units), which only achieve 100 meter accuracy, and a factor of a hundred
less expensive than conventional DGPS receivers. Location-based
authentication is a powerful new tool that can provide a new dimension of
network security never before possible. The CyberLocator technology is
currently operational in a portable demonstration.

Denning hasn't thought this through. Do the math.
The diameter of the earth is 12,576 km
The speed of light is about 3e5 km/sec
-> max phase shift to simulate = 42 msec.
This is on roughly the same scale as network delays, or less. If you are trying to simulate a location in roughly the same area as your
actual location (say, on the same continent), the max phase shift to simulate is
a lot smaller - probably less than 5 ms.
The site checking the incoming packets for their origin has to allow for
realistic network delays - say 100 -200 ms.
Therefore any site that can see the same set of satellites as the site it is
trying to simulate can do so, buffering less than 50 ms of waveforms and
pretending to be on the end of a slow link.
Denning's plan: A beautiful idea murdered by cold, unfeeling facts.

Both versions were compiled under Visual C++ 4.0, with Optimizations set to 'Maximize speed', and inlines to 'any suitable', and run on a 90MHz Digital Celebris 590 under WinNT 3.51.

               Germany Passes Sweeping Cyberspace Law                The German government approved a bill Wednesday aimed at
               regulating the Internet and protecting user privacy while banning
               smut, pro-Nazi content and online fraud. The so-called
               "multimedia law" essentially extends current German laws to the
               dominion of cyberspace, placing responsibility for suspect
               content on suppliers, but without clearly defining whether a
               supplier could also be construed to make a carrier -- such as an
               online service like CompuServe or AOL Bertelsmann Online --
               also liable.                The law is scheduled to take effect in August 1997, prior to the
               1998 deregulation of the European telecommunications market.                Under the law, online services could be held responsible for
               illegal material if they have the technology to block transmission
               of such content, and after notification, still disseminate the
               objectionable content.                The law also calls for content to be tagged electronically if
               unsuitable for minors to ensure it could be filtered out --similar
               to the V-chip television initiative in the U.S. The law would also
               prohibit "cookies" -- tiny programs that trace a user's path
               through the Net, recording what they visit, examine and
               purchase. Instead, the law would require that services give users
               the opportunity to use a site or service anonymously.                The German law also puts into place the idea of so called "digital
               signatures" -- a string of coded information which would clearly
               identify the origin of messages, files and images shipped via the
               Net. Such signatures would use a central authority to prevent
               fraudulent commercial transactions on the computer network by
               matching a publicly accessible data string with a confidential
               string of numbers, also called a key.

64 bit session keys, as opposed to the old 40 bit version.
24 bits of the session key are stored encrypted under a special, government-access RSA public key. This is in addittion to the full

The idea is that the USG would have to search only a 40-bit keyspace,
while others will need to search a 64-bit keyspace.
Reportedly, this 'workfactor reduction key' will NOT be available to foreign governments.

I suspect that Lotus has not completely reworked it's security system for the international version, and that they are in fact doing a second public key operation on the 3 bytes of GAK'd data.
If they're nasty, they'll check on the receiving side as well, to ensure that the LEAF and/or the espionage-enabling key have not been patched in the sending 'International'

In the private sector, the opinion in a lot of US firms was 'yeah,

This, I think, is one place where the activities of members of this list
have had a real effect. Last September, three or four semi-overlapping
efforts succeeded in brute-forcing 40 bit RC4 (used in export-quality SSL).
This had three main effects:
1. Raising the issue in the media, and thus in the public consciousness.
2. Within a month, the government was starting to talk about permitting the
export of stronger (but GAK'd) encryption products.
3.  It enabled people like Jeff to argue successfully that releasing only an export-strength product was no longer a viable option.In practical terms

@_subject: Brute Force DES 
In my terminology, 'hairy edge of doability" means we have a shot
at success, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.
I thought that I might bet a couple hundred bucks, though.
Sadly, after further calculation, I'm not so sure if it's doable just yet.
What I'm looking at is a known plaintext attack on single ECB DES, using a brute-force test to cycle through the key space. People would get chunks of keyspace to test from a central server or servers, and would be motivated to take part by a cash prize for
the lucky person who finds the key.
Lets do  the numbers:
Single DES has the security of 56 bits of key - there are 64 bits in the
keys, but 8 of them are parity bits which add nothing to security.
2^56  = 7.205e16 keys (which is a whopping big number)
Let's guess that we can recruit the equivalent of full-time on 1000
7.205e13 keys/machine.
Let's guess that we have about a month before people start to lose interest - so we want to be more than 1/2 done by then. Lets say
we want to sweep the whole space in 40 days.
1.8e12 keys/machine/day ~21,000,000 keys/machine/second
The fastest general purpose, freely available des implementation I'm
aware of is libdes. by Eric Young. With this, I can do a set_key in 15.8 us, and an ecb_encrypt in 95 us/block. That adds up to about 9,000 keytests/sec (this is on a 90 MHz P5, running NT).
I'm looking at ideas to speed up DES - if I'm willing to use
honking great lookup tables, the permutation steps  can be done more quickly than libdes. I'm also looking at implementing the
algolrithm in hand-optimized P5 assembler.  (It's been years since
I've done a major assembler project - the P5 has some truely weird
features to be considered, but also has (some) internal 64 bit
registers to play with).
Let's guess that I can speed up a key-test up by a factor of 10. (This is
not a slur on Eric's code - it's extremely clever, but not optimized
for any particular processor, or for key-testing.  Note that the keytest described above takes about 10,000 cycles/test.)
That gets my workstation up to about 90,000 keys a second, which is
still almost a factor of 250 too slow. I'm going ahead with my work on a faster DES keytester, but unless
optimizing gives an astounding win, I now think a distributed bruting effort is a bit pre-mature.
What will make this brute doable, if not now, then in the near future?
1. Faster Processors - Moore's Law is still holding. A year ago, my
90 MHz Pentium was one of the faster machines taking part in the
40-bit RC4 crack. Now, it's passe.
2. More processors. The number of people on the internet continues
to grow rapidly.
3. More interest - Crypto awareness has greatly increased in the
last year, and a real cash prize (say, over $500) will generate both
publicity and interest.
These factors all multiply together. The number of cycles that could
probably be recruited is increasing at a fast rate. A major part of the
work will be a keyspace distribution mechanism which can handle
the load (this was a major stumbling block last year). Peter Trei

@_subject: DES Optimization (Brute Force DES) 
Yep - with good optimization, the keygen and the des rounds get very close
to each other in processing cost. Let's look at the steps involved (I'm refering
to the DES description in Schneier, 2nd ed, p 270-278). I've not yet coded these
optimizations, so this may be subject to revision.
I'm assuming a known plaintext attack on a single 64 bit block, ECB mode.
What we want to obtain is the key (which was presumably also used to encode
interesting data which we can't read)
First of all, we can move the initial and final permutes (tables 12.1 and 12.8)
completely out of the testing loop. These have to done only once per run, and
thus are effectively zero cost.
Similarly, we can eliminate the key permutation (table 12.2), and iterate the permuted 56 bit key. If we get at hit, we invert the key permutation and add back the parity bits to get the original key.
In the DES round The S-box and P-box steps can be combined into a single 48->32 bit permutation.
So, per round (there are 16), we now have:
1. copy 32 bit sub-block to use as 'other' half in next round.
2. expansion permutation  (32 -> 48)
3. xor with appropriate subkey.
4. perform the s-p permutation. (48->32)
5. xor with 'other' half from previous round.
The key scheduling can be done in parallel with the rounds, since we're only planning on
using each key once. However, on the Pentium it may be more efficient to do it before the des rounds,  due to register starvation. Generating the subkeys is actually quite painful. You have to rotate the 56 bit key as two 28 bit halves, by one or two bits depending on the round, and then do a 56-> 48 bit
permutation to generate the subkey. This step needs to be done 16 times.
In a regular DES implementation,  you generate the key schedules once at the start, and reuse them for each block, so there is little to be gained by optimzing this step. In a keysearch situation it's a different matter.
Optimizing the permutations:
DES was originally designed for hardware implementation, where permutation is a simple matter of braiding the wires between the input and output. It's a lot harder in software. I'm aware of two basic approaches:
1. Algorithmic: Analyse the permutation table to find bits which get shifted in the same direction, by the same number of bits, and arrange a series of SHIFTs, ANDs, and ORs to generate
the desired permutation. This is essentially a geometry problem.
2. Lookup: Create tables for the permutation. While a permutation with n bits of input requires 2^n entries (each the size of the output data) if done as a single table, it's
possible to break the permutation into several smaller tables, at increased processing time. This is a classic speed vs space tradeoff, with a big step if your tables are too
large to fit into cache (and even bigger if they go to virtual memory)
Example: A straight 32 -> 32 bit permutation:
If done as one table, it would have 2^32 entries, and take about 16 Gbytes.
If broken up into 4 tables, each of which dealt with 8 bits of the input, it would
take 4096 bytes total. However, the calculation would require extracting the four
eight bit subkeys from the input, doing four lookups, and ORing the four results
together to get the final output.
A 32 bit perm could also be done with two tables, but they would occupy half a Mb.
The S-P step and the compression step of the key schedule are probably  faster
by lookup than by algorithm. I'm not sure about the expansion permutation, which is very regular. The size and number of tables used is going to depend a lot on cache size and available memory - for example, the rotates in the key scheduling can be eliminated
if I'm willing to maintain 16 key compression tables (one for each round).
I strongly expect that the whole key testing loop can fit into the 8k L1 code cache.
The lookup tables *may* fit into the L2 cache.
If anyone has any other optimizations, I'd like to hear about them.

There's a big difference between a real bank and a data collection outfit. I used
to work at a major money center bank in the Wall Street area. To get to the data center I had to:
1. Walk into the building, past an armed security guard.
2. Within sight of him, use my badge stripe to get through a turnstile - most employees
    had badges which were limited in the times they would work.
3. Take an elevator to the (unadvertised)  correct floor.
4. Use my badge in a reader to get out of the elevator lobby - most badges were     restricted in the floors they would open.
5. Use my badge to get through an unmarked door, into the 'airlock'.
In the airlock, I'd hold my photo ID up to a reader, so the guard downstairs could.
a. Compare my face against that on the photo ID.
b. Check that I was authorized to enter the data center.
c. Check that there was no one else in the airlock with me.
If he was satisfied, he'd open the inside door remotely.
6. The data center was manned by at least two operators (usually more), 24 hours
a day, seven days a week. Only they were permitted to touch terminals connected to
operational systems.
(There were other security features I won't go into.)
Sure, our fiber optic lines to CHIPS and the Fed occasionally went out - that's what backup dialout phone lines are for. If we had phone
problems, the lines were fixed in a couple hours, not days. At a pinch, I imagine you

Reply-to:      ben at algroup.co.uk
Someone, somewhere, posted a rumour that Europe was about to go for a key
escrow scheme known as "Royal Holloway".
I have done a little research and gleaned the following:
It is, apparently, true that the EC is considering schemes for key escrow, by
"trusted third parties" (trusted by who, I'd like to know?). "Royal Holloway"
is one of these schemes. It is named after the college of origin, if anyone
cares. It essentially revolves around each pair of TTPs sharing two out of
three parts of a key, and generating the third part for each of their users.
The idea is that either of the TTPs who generated keys for an encrypted
message exchange can decode it (by using the private key of their "client" and
the public key of the other TTP's "client").
Full details can be found at:
This is in PostScript. I'm not aware of any plain text versions.
I'm informed that this is likely to be introduced into EC legislation, though
my understanding is that members are not required to actually incorporate the
legislation. No doubt France will embrace it with happy shouts.
Of course, it is our duty as netizens to resist this kind of rubbish, and I
encourage you to write to your MP/EuroMP (or local equivalent).

Federal Computer Week, Nov 11, 1996.
"DES set for overhaul." by HEATHER HARRELD
The content is kind of thin, but it amounts to a statement that
NIST is preparing a Federal Register request for a successor to
DES. Most the article concerns the termendous hassle replacing
DES will be for government agencies (FCW is a trade rag for people
working with computers in the Federal and State sectors - I used to
get it when I was at MITRE.)
There's a truely clueless comment at the end, where Mike Schwartz
of "Prime Factors Inc., an Oregon-based security firm" is quoted
as saying "...DES shows no signs of weakening."
While 3DES-EDE is the obvious replacement, it would be far from an
easy switch, since there are a huge number of fielded devices for handling the 64 bit single DES keys.
I wonder how good a drop-in replacement could be made
if the goal was to NOT have to replace the key handling infrastructure - just replace a single software module or chip.
If we use the bits currently devoted to parity in DES keys for
actual key data, we gain 8 bits, or a factor of x256 in the keyspace.
If we further complicate the key schedule setup, so it's much slower than DES in both hardware and software (lots of rotates, multiplies, state, etc), we can make life a lot more difficult for brute force attacks.
Maybe some version of Blowfish, using the same key twice - I have
not studied Blowfish, so I don't know if this introduces an obvious

@_subject: Can we kill single DES? 
Since it looks like the US government will be allowing the export of 56 bit espionage-enabled software, it's time to kill single DES.
As some of you will recall, a while back I wondered aloud about the
feasibility of brute-forcing DES on general purpose machines, ala the
RC4-40 crack last year. Unlike many cypherpunks, I actually write code (:-). I took Phil
Karn's DES386 as a starting point, and modified it to run effiiciently
on the Pentium. The code I've written will run 14 round DES (all
that is required for a key test app) at 254,000 crypts/sec on a
90 MHz Pentium.  Allow about 10% overhead for key scheduling (there are some tricks to
speed this up), and we're still at about 250,000 keys/sec on a 100MHz
Pentium (I'm using a nominal 100 MHz Pentium as my 'unit' of
cpu power).  On a Pentium, it runs entirely in the L1 cache.  The code will also run on a 486, but at less than half the number of crypts/sec for the same clock speed.
On this type of processor, it would still take 9133 years to exhaust a 56 bit key space. On the other hand, on 20,000 processors of this
power it would take less than 6 months. If the target is encrypted
in a chaining mode with an unknown 8 byte IV, the time more than doubles. Clearly, this goes far beyond the number of cpus available to the members of this list (though well within the power of most governments
and  many corporations)
The best idea I've heard for recruiting this many cpu cycles is to create
a screen saver which does DES-cracking while machines are idle.
Another incentive is to offer a cash prize to the person(s) who find the
Yes, I KNOW that a hardware based cracker is a LOT more efficient,
but between the up-front cost and the difficulty of design and production,
it's less likely to get done.  (Still if someone wants to buy me a nice
FPGA board, I'll see what I can do).
If you're interested in volunteering machines to do a key search, please
read to the end.
Questions for general discussion:
1. Is this a good idea? What will happen if DES becomes perceived
    as insecure?
2. What is the probability of success required to make it worth doing?
3. What would be the consequences of failure?
4. What other platforms than NT/Win95/Pentium should be considered?
   I could write a Unix demon version, but unless it's tailored for the    cpu, a lot of efficency is lost
   (The aggregate number of idle cycles available for testing is the   crucial number).
5. What's a good target? Ideally, we need a plaintext/ciphertext pair,
   encrypted in Single DES ECB mode. Preferably from a commercially
   available program, in which a single key is used for a great deal
   of traffic over a long period. I would strongly prefer, however, that    the target key be a  *test* key - I don't want to compromise    anyone's actual security.
   We need a target which is both convincing and realistic.
6. What other incentives can be used to recruit machines?
If you're interested in volunteering cycles:
RESPOND ONLY TO ME (trei at process.com), NOT TO THE LIST.  The last thing we need is a hundred 'I'll help' messages on the list.
Assume that the program will be a Win95/NT screen saver or Unix deamon. Think about how many machines you could get it to run on (maybe you can talk other people into installing
it as a screen saver or background task)
I have not written the screen saver yet. I will not do so unless it looks like we'lll get enough machines, so nothing is likely to happen for a couple of months at least.
I need to estimate how many cpu cycles will be available:
Number of Pentiums * Hours available/week * MHz
(Number of 486's * Hours available/week * MHz * 0.30)
For, Alphas, MIPS, Motorola, PowerPC etc, running UN*X, MAC, etc, just report how many cpus,  their speed, and OS - I'll need help to get versions for other platfoms. 64 bit processors like the Alpha
can run this stuff *fast*.
Send the aggregate numbers to me. I'll also need to know how many machines are directly on the Internet and could thus query a key-space server, and how many would need some other mechanism to get keyspace and report results. If you're volunteering
machines which are outside of the US/Canada, please note the fact:
ITAR may be an issue here.
 I'll summarize to the list.

@_subject: Can we kill single DES? #2 
Yesterday I posted 'Can we kill single DES?', and I count about 20 responses, counting both those to the list, and those to me personally.
One offer was made of a $1000 reward in return for a crack, if the
offerer could make publicity hay of the offer (no, I don't have a problem
with that, but I'd like it set up so that others could add to the reward as
well). If the reward got big enough ($10k?) I think it would be a major incentive for otherwise uninterested people to run the screen
saver. On the other hand, it might get into legal hassles - I don't know.
The total cpu power pledged at the moment could sweep the key
space in 300-400 years, if my speed estimates are correct. I'm  concerned that the key scheduling may be worse than I estimated in my earlier letter - Phil Karn's code to generate the key schedule takes about 150x as long as my code takes to test the key. However, neither he nor I have bothered yet to optimize this part of the code, or reduce it to
assembler. It looks like I can get this part down to two instructions
per round, at least most of the time.
I'm really concerned about the problem of a search failing, or succeeding only after too long a time. Perry's proposal of about
a month of real time is on the right order, though I could see up
to 3 months being possible.
Here's what I'm thinking of doing:
1. Writing a prose description of the platform independent speedups.
2. Writing a proposal for a client-server protocol for doling out
   keyspace and returning results. Aside from the direct Internet
   interface, there will also be a mechanism for i/o via plain text -
   suitable for cut-and-paste, or simple CLI interfaces.
3. Writing a generic 'C' implementation of the keysearch client and server,    which demonstrates the i/o and the various speedups. This should
   be highly portable (but probably non-exportable). You'd also be able
   to search randomly, or from a designated starting point.
4. Work on the screen-saver based version of the client.
I'm still very interested in hearing about any hardware based approaches actually underway - not a pile of wild-assed guesses
and hopes.
Those who want to look at a fast DES in assembler should check out Phil's 386 version, which includes both generic C and a variety
of assembler implementations for the actual encryption step. See:
Phil also has a Pentium version (a little slower than mine) which he mails to US citizens.

Are you suggesting that someone specifically set up a ring of child pornographers/murders in Belgium, then let it get caught, in
an attempt to influence the EU parliment?
Or are you suggesting that this particular gang of sub-humans was
exposed at this time in an attempt to influence policy, implying that
the Belgian LEAs knew about, but did not stop the ring until they
needed a publicity coup?
I find such notions utterly beyond rationality.
Do you expect we're going to see a statement from some Belgian
police investigator to the effect of "Yes, I  knew they were raping and
killing children, but was told to do nothing, and I obeyed."? There is a tendency of many on this list to demonize those we disagree with. If a person or group takes the 'wrong' stance on cryptography, key "escrow", etc, many list members will act as if that person or group were capable of any atrocity, and is acting out
of the very worst of motives and hidden agendas.
Such an attitude is common, but not desirable in the modern world.
It served some purpose when war involved the literal massacre of one's opponents - it's easier to commit genocide against the tribe
over the ridge if you demonize them into not-quite-humans, but in
the modern world this is not a rational option.

The number of machines working on DESCrack was probably in the 20-30,000 Actually, most participants worked without any expectation of getting the full $10k. DESChall gave the finder of the magic key $4k, the organizers $2k, with the rest going to charity. In the European effort, aside from a few hundred dollars to cover expenses, the entire amount would have gone to Project Gutenburg (as it did in the
48 bit RC5 crack). Only people running uncoordinated searches, such
as Mikkelsen's Bryddes or my Deskr, could look forward to receiving
the entire prize.
Interestingly, many of the European workers looked on the monetary award with disdain - they participated 'to show Internet user solidarity', and other such reasons. Also, many were using university
owned machines, and were legally constrained from accepting money earned from their use.
This came as quite a suprise to me. I had picked the $10k figure in my
proposal to RSA because it fell in the range of other prizes they had
offered, and seemed high enough to motivate people with no emotional
or ideological interest in the issues to run free software.
I think the effort would be better spent on a factoring challenge.

Offer a 'birthday present' program, under which *any*
female over the age of 11 who has not yet had a child or become
pregnant, on her birthday, gets a cash award. The award should
be high enough to encourage participation; $250 seems about
right. A woman who can deliberatly turn down a $250 lump sum every year for the rest of her life is almost certainly able
to afford to raise a child.
This scheme:
* Is entirely voluntary; no one has to use contraceptives,   stay off welfare, or anything else.
* Targets young women who would be likely to become 'welfare
  mothers'. The parents of such young women would be highly
  motivated to have their dependent daughters participate.
I haven't worked out the costs, but suspect that the net savings would be quite substantial.

@_subject: lack of evolution (So What!) 
One factor which everyone seems to be overlooking in this
thread is the future impact of biotechnology.
Sure, evolution by natural selection has largely halted for
the human race - we were, on average, probably at our fittest
about 10,000 years ago, before the introduction of agriculture.
However, artificial evolution will soon take over.
There are two main forms - purely biological evolution through
genetic engineering, and a continued evolution in our collaboration with devices.
We are on the verge of achieving the first. We may soon be
able to eliminate many genetically related diseases and
conditions. While Rifkin and other Luddites rail against the unnaturalness
of it all, they will fail. There are too many cases where
GE is an unquestionable good. If parents had the option of
the following traits in their children, how many would refuse?
* Perfect teeth - natural immunity to caries.
* Immunity to cancer.
* Immunity to AIDS (about 1% of the current population is
  naturally immune)
* Ditto many other diseases, genetic and infectious.
All the above may be available in the next 20 years. (The anti-AIDS gene maybe in 10 - it looks like an easy one). In the longer run, almost anything that can be imagined may be possible, including physical immortality and increased
Secondly, we've evolved as a tool-using species for a million years, and our technology is as much a part of our
inheritance as are our genes. Where will it take us no one
knows, but the future will be richer and stranger than we
can imagine. Our machines will help re-make what it is to
be 'human'. This includes all devices - cyborg or external,
nano or macro, sentient or dumb.
So I'm not too worried that the cull rate due to sabre-tooth
tigers has dropped off, nor even that the irresponsible are
no longer starving to death, which Tim would seem to want. Our technology can and will overcome these little problems.

You are not thinking this through. Under this scheme, every welfare mother would march her girls down to the clinic and get them Norplanted as soon as she could. Those girls would not be able to further add to the welfare rolls
until they reach legal age, and could have the contraceptive removed without their mother's permission.
By then they'd have developed a habit of contraception, which would likely continue.

I usually ignore people whose clue meter reads in the negative, (hint: cypherpunks want people to have *better* security, not less), but there's a long standing tradition on cpunks of being creative with other people's typos.
Lets see:
"Phranking" This seems to draw from the word 'franking' which is
related to snail mail cancellation, and 'phreaking' which is a
contraction of 'phone freaking', refering to stealing phone
service. Therefore, 'phranking' must mean the art of faking stamps
and postal cancellations in an effort to steal postal service. I
don't think anyone on this list can help you. Ask again after the
PO introduces it's 2D barcoded stamps, when the privacy implications
may spark some interest (btw, I spotted something very much like this on a UPS package last night).
'Cryptomography' seems to draw from 'crypto', meaning 'secret'
and 'tomography' the art of making crossectional images (tomography is the T in CAT scan). Therefore, 'cryptomography' is
the art of making secret crossectional images. I think the query should have been directed to the people who make airport luggage scanners, or some very weird subset of voyeurs, not us.

@_subject: Prizes, and coordinated vs uncoordinated search, redux. 
[Sorry about the long list of lists, but this issue
is being discussed in all of them.]
1. Different set of people seem to be working towards
different sets of goals, and this seems to be the
source of a lot of contention.
My personal goal is to promote the easing of US export
restrictions on cryptographic software. I regard these
restrictions as promoting crime and espionage. They are also driving US jobs overseas, and crippling the
US software industry's ability to compete in the world marketplace (yes, I'm an American, and have every intention of promoting my countries best Recently, the US government tightened the rules on
cryptographic software export, but left one tiny
Devil's bargain of a loophole: if firms would agree
in future to compromise the integrity of their
products by adding back doors for 'key recovery',
then they could export single DES sofware without 'key recovery' until the end of 1998.
Clearly, the government's intent is to bribe software
developers into 'voluntarily' adopting GAK (Government
Access to Keys), when they would never do so without
incentive. The rules also require that if either end
of a transmission uses a GAK'd product, then both
sides of the transmission must be tappable. This makes it difficult for GAK'd and non-GAK'd products to
interoperate, and is a wedge to force GAK'd products
into even purely domestic communications.
I think that this is a horrible idea. One way to fight it is to discredit DES, by showing that any one with sufficient computing resources (or a modest amount of cash) can get single-DES keys broken. If I destroy the market for new DES products,
developers will have less incentive to go along with
the government's Faustian scheme.
The model I am trying to emulate is that of a criminal
or spy agency which wishes to decrypt a captured transmission. It's not unusual for such a capture to have a  partially known plaintext. In some cases, they may be able to use special hardware to search the keyspace quickly, but if they don't, they could
simply put out a message on the sci.crypt: "Tell me
what DES key decrypts 0f 1e 2d 3c 4b 5a 69 78 to 'HTTP/1.0' and I'll send you $10,000." This level
of attack is available to almost anyone, and I intend
to show that it is effective. If the coordinated groups don't want to share their
keyspace maps with others, that's their business. Effectively, they become just another uncoordinated
searcher (though a very fast one). If a coordinated
searcher does publish it's map, then people who trust
it can use the data to avoid going over old ground.
This would speed the search as we near the end, but
has very little effect at the beginning.
--------------------------- The coordinated groups are still trying to get their
infrastructure in place. In the meantime, at my small
employer, we are already searching about 10 million
keys/sec, with probably twice that being searched by
people with my software on the outsde. And I have still
to do a general call for participation...

@_subject: [DES] DES Key Recovery Project, Progress Report #5 
DES Key Recovery Project, Progress Report 6 January 1997
Well, the New Year brings changes....
1. I'm astonished at the low level of reaction RSA's announcement that they will be sponsoring a DES Challenge, with a $10,000 cash prize.
I've been working with people at RSA to get this set up. It looks like
there'll be an ascii-plaintext challenge (we won't know the full
plaintext - just that it's ascii, and long enough to be unambigious),
and the full prize will go the first person who emails them the key. This is pretty much what we need to recruit a large number of otherwise dis-interested people, and their machines. The code
will be a tad slower than for an attack where we know the full
plaintext of the block sought, but not much.
2. As for my code for WinTel machines - it's very close to an initial alpha release (squashing a few last bugs). I intend this to be used only for identifying porting issues. The first 'real' version is a couple weeks away. Once the alpha is out, I'll be looking at the new assembly
language code from Eric Young and Svend Mikkelsen to see
how it compares with mine. Since Eric independently matched
my speed in the DES round, I want to see if he is using any
different tricks than I.
When it's released, my code will be able to:
1. Run a validity and speed test.
2. Accept a specified 32 bit 'chunk' of the keyspace to test. When it
   finishes a chunk, it appends information about whether it found the
   key to a results file, and also any half-matches it found along
   with a checksum. The latter two items help make cheating and
   sabotage more difficult. 3. Read it's input (plaintext, IV, etc) from a file. After the actual
   DES Challenge is announced, I'll hardwire that challenge into the
   program.
4. Periodically checkpoint it's status to a file. This is so that the
   program can be stopped at any time neccesary, without losing more
   than a few minutes work. At startup, it looks in this file for
   where to continue searching, unless instructed otherwise.  It will NOT run as a screen saver. It's actually more efficient to run
as a low-priority task in the background - that way it soaks up unused
cycles even when a screen saver is not in operation. If someone else
want's to incorporate it into an SS, go ahead.
The alpha will run in a DOS box under Win95 and WinNT. A GUI
interface may come along later.
It will NOT talk to a keyspace server, though the format of the input and output should make it possible to add this in the future. I don't have time to develop both myself, and while people on the lists have proposed any number of complex schemes for setting up and managing a server, no one in the US seems
willing to do the work (I'm worried about violating ITAR/EAR).
I have a pretty good idea what needed in a server. At very least, I'd
like to have people register the fact that they are taking part, so we
get some idea of the level of effort being expended.
The very first time it is started up on a given machine, if it is not given a specific chunk at which to start, it will pick one at random. The checkpointing scheme means that on later runs, it will pick up where it left off, advancing to the next chunk as it completes each one.
For this purpose, we don't need cryptographically strong PRNG,
just one that provides a fairly smooth distribution of results.
This means that the search *will* complete, but the time is not
as good as a carefully doled-out keyspace would provide. If you
want to do the math, go ahead, but I think it will average about
twice as long as a purely doled-out search to search the whole
keyspace, and somewhat less to search half the keyspace.

DES Key Recovery Project, Progress Report Well, RSA now has put up the official rules, and some
test data, for the DES Key Recovery Project. See
 if you haven't
already. The actual challenge will be posted 28 Jan, and
the prize will be $10,000. I've had some nibbles of interest from the FPGA community,
but not too much yet. If you know anyone with FPGA or ASIC
hardware handy, tell them about the project, and point them
at Wiener's paper (it can be found at  among locations.
My software is complete, except for one thing: I have not
incorporated Svend Olaf Mikkelsen's new Pentium code
(see  This is about
25% faster than mine, and well worth the extra effort. The
conversion turns out to be non-trivial; it uses a different
initial and final perm, the key schedules look different, and
the rounds seem to carry a lot of context from one round to the
next in the registers. All but the final problem is not too
important - the data are all different by simple permutations,
and the conversion is not too hard.
The final problem is more interesting, since I do the first
DES round only part of the time. This means that I'll have to
do more context setup for those times when I'm starting at the second round (most of the time), and preserve that extra
context after the times I *do* run the first round.
The other problem is that the 'half-matches' and penultimate
round half-matches will be different for the two systems. This
complicates results checking.
Anyway, come Monday, I want to email to a few people the generic 'C' code, along with my assembler version. If you're
interested in doing a serious critique and/or porting of the code, and are a US/Canadian citizen living in the US/Canada, then email me with a statement to that effect. I'm only sending
out a few copies - this is a slow beta, after all.
If I don't get the Mikkelsen code in there by Monday, it should follow soon thereafter.
After the DES Challenge is underway, I may try looking at
the RC5 Challenges.
Who else will be attending Verisign Partner Days or the RSA Data Security Conference at the end of the month? I'd

@_subject: Rep. White introduces Internet Protection Act 
^^^^^^^^^^
Here's a fun little thought experiment:
Considering the hairsplitting that takes place everyday
in courtrooms these days, an arguement could be made that
since virtually the entire net these days is optical fiber,
there are no 'electronic' communications taking place.
Does the FCC charter mention photonic communications as well? At what point does the charter allow them to interfere? Here's some steps on the way...
* A mime, 'working' outdoors in daylight.
The communication is entirely by photons, and the light
source is non-electronic. (I know that many people
would like to see mimes suppressed for the good of humanity, but bear with me).
* A mime, working by electric light.
Does the fact that electricity is involved in
creating the light make the communication 'electronic'? I don't think so. (IANAL) It (the
mime) is certainly modulating the (electronically
generated) light, just as an optical transducer
* A mime, illuminated by an electric
light, and viewed through a fiberscope.
There's certainly no new 'electronic' components
introduced at this step, so sending modulated, electronically generated, photonic messages through an optical fiber would not seem to constitute an 'electronic' communication.
* A mime performing inside a sealed box, illuminated by electric light and viewed through a fiberscope.
Once again, no new 'electronic' components have
been added. * The mime, finally realising that the box is airtight and unopenable (I told you to bear
with me :-), signals for help by sending Morse code down the fiberscope with a flashlight.
The other end of the fiberscope enters a similar
box, where another mime flashes back "Great
'walking against the wind' technique, but I can't
help - my box is sealed too."
Is this an electronic communication?
This is getting pretty close to the situation of
two computers connected by fiber optics - the communication mode is even digital. The boxes are silent, consume electric power, and communicate
via optical fiber. I don't think the FCC's jurisdiction extends inside the boxes, where all the 'electronic' portions of the system reside.
Just some idle speculation...

This seems to be what you are suggesting.
I have this niggling memory at the back of my mind to the
effect that the FCC regulates nothing above a certain
frequency (somewhere in the microwave region). I don't
know if this is an internal rule, or something imposed on
them by charter or congress.
I'm not sure what the limit is. The highest frequency I've

There are two things you *can* do. 1. You can put a disclaimer on your page "If you linked here from XXX.XXX.XXX, please be aware that I object to that connection for the following reasons..."
2. If you or your webmaster have any kind of technical sophistication, you can force links to your page to go to a CGI script, which uses the HTTP-referrer: header to provide different
pages depending on the source of the connection. I suspect that
Ticketmaster is doing something like this in blocking links from MSN. But please, don't try to extend the 'information superhighway' (blech!) metaphor to include virtual sidewalks with picketing

Immigrants change their names to Icelandic ones as a requirement of citizenship. The one exception is that if you are still living in the place you were born, you can adopt the placename
as your surname. Thus, Iceland, with only 265,000 people, has phonebooks which index by location and profession as well as by name to reach a reasonable level of dis-ambiguation.
[Doubtless some Magnus Magnusson (the most common male Icelandic name) will correct some of the details here.]

'Publically funded network backbones'? Can you name one (in the US)? NSFnet and ARPAnet are long dead. Back when they were active, there was considerable debate about the legality of commercial speech on the net, and earlier, doubts about the legality of any traffic (including private email) which was not in support of government funded research.
(the first big mailing list, the SF-Lovers Digest, had a quasi-underground existence for many years due to this worry).
None of which have the slightest relevance - Internet II is a proposed (and still vaporware) project for an academic-research-only
network - it's future existence has no impact on those of us using
the private backbone system of today. Ditto that 'supercomputer science network thingy' you mention, which I suspect is the same thing. As for "V-II Chip... GAK... ITAR": The fact that some people
in government propose unconstitutional regulations, unworkable
technologies, and policies which work against the public interest
is not a basis to propose further undesirable policies.
Question: if you get the ability to put up your 'cyber-picket' frame,
how about cyber-counter-pickets? Cant the picketee put a page in front of yours? Who gets priority? Where does it stop? Jim, your idea is roadkill on that horribly imprecise analogy, the 'information superhighway' (spit). It can't be resuscitated by asking for 'information super-sidewalks' or claiming the existance of 'information super-public-spaces'. The underlying metaphor is fatally flawed.

@_subject: Arguments for good crypto and against GAK. 
I frequently find myself explaining to the
uninitiated the whole crypto mess, and have come up
with a line of arguments which I find work fairly
Basically, I take the tack that strong encryption will
help prevent crime, espionage, and terrorism, while weak and/or GAKed crypto will promote it. There are good arguements for this position.
We lock our houses, cars, etc. This activity is
promoted by the police as a crime prevention measure,
although it unquestionably makes it more difficult for
them to serve search warrants, etc. They realize that good locks prevent far more crime than would their
unfettered access to unlocked property.
Crypto works the same way as good locks, but in the data sphere. While it would clearly make court-authorized wiretaps more difficult (but not impossible), it also stops the far more frequent
unauthorized interception of messages by criminals
(whether in or out of government).
At this point I usually give some recent examples of losses that might have been prevented by good
crypto - cell phone cloning fraud and eavesdropping,
the recent credit card sniffer, etc. Going back a couple of years, some hackers on the west coast
modified major backbone routers to record ftp and
telnet passwords, etc. If the audience is aware of
the putative info-war threat, I can work that in as another threat that good crypto can put a stop to.
If the question arises 'well, why does the FBI, etc,
seem so worried about the widespread use of crypto?',
I have a response.
"There's an old saying: 'When you're up to your ass in
alligators, it's hard to remember that you're trying
to drain the swamp.'"
We have law enforcement agencies because we want people and their property to be safer. However, the
FBI and other LEAs actually do very little to directly *prevent* crime; almost all of their efforts
are post-facto, designed to catch criminals, or make
it easier to catch them, *after* they've already
committed one or more offences. While a criminal in jail is only rarely a menace to society at large, most criminals get away with many crimes before they are caught - if this was not the case, there would be no such thing as a 'career criminal'.
LEAs have little motivation to prevent crime - there
is not much career or budget boost in a robbery which
did not take place, a murder which was not committed,
or a spy who could not get the data he sought. Widespread and effective use of good crypto acts before the fact, preventing crimes from occuring in the first place. While it certainly would make
some wiretaps more difficult (and here I bring up the very low number of wiretaps preformed in the US compared to the number of crimes), on the balance
it is clear that the use of good security is a win.
If you ask most people if they had a choice between
a high crime rate with some of the criminals being
caught, and a much lower crime rate with a slightly
higher chance of them getting away, most people who
are not part of the LEA establishment will instantly
opt for the latter.
As for GAK, there are two basic arguements I use. First, I ask them how they would feel if their town required
that copies of all house, car, and file cabinet keys
be deposited with the local cops 'just in case they
need to serve a search warrant'. Most people are rightly appalled by the idea. Secondly, I describe the idea of key escrow agencies
and "TTPs", and how they would create huge storehouses
of private keys. I point out what a target of opportunity these archives would provide to criminals and
spies - by compromising the security of a single site, they could unlock the private, confidential information
of thousands of individuals and corporations. Depending
on the audience, I might bring up Filegate, Aldrich
Ames, the Walker case, etc, to demonstrate that even
the government can't be relied on to keep secrets
("despite their best intentions"), and re-emphasize the
catastrophic single-point-of-failure that GAK
In short, it's possible to pro-crypto, anti-GAK without ever getting near sounding  anti-government; in fact, being pro-crypto, anti-GAK can be a conservative, anti-crime, law & order position.

The question of what happens to property which is bought in good faith, but is later discovered to be stolen, is not a clear one,
and is dealt with in different ways in different countries.
In the US, the property nearly always reverts to the original owner,
unless the thief is a government. However, I remember reading articles about stolen art which implied that that is not always the case in Europe.
When the stolen article is land, or governments and/or national pride
are involved, things get very strange. Greece is still trying to recover the Elgin Marbles, which were taken by a Briton from
the Parthenon around 1810, during the Turkish occupation. I'm sure
Egypt would also like the Rosetta stone back - this was taken by
Napolean in 1799, and later captured by the British. Both are now
in the British Museum.
Sometimes the claims go across millenia - the record I can think of being that certain specific parcels of land in Israel are claimed by modern Jewish settlers on the grounds that their purchase from the Philistines is explicitly mentioned in the Old Testament, while there is no extant record of their sale to the modern (non-Jewish) owners.

I'm curious as to why you feel the need to conceal your identity.
It's a symbol, not the thing symbolized. You are confusing the map with the country. Burning the flag is a statement by the burner that they feel that the
symbol has become empty, and the freedom which the flag symbolizes is
gone or has been compromised in some manner. It's clearly a form of
political speech. True, It's a very strong statement, but strong political speech has been protected by the Constitution (at least up till You are mistaken - some of the people opposing your viewpoint have stated that they are veterans.
It does *stand* for freedom and liberty, but only as long those values really exist. It *is* *not* freedom and libery in it's own
When what the flag symbolizes is gone, it becomes just a piece of cloth. Burning this cloth draws attention to the loss. It is a dramatic
statement, but under certain circumstances an appropriate one.
Thank you for your opinion. You are of course free to express it. And I, and other thoughtful, freedom-loving Americans can oppose it.
Think about this:
Would you rather people did not burn the flag because:
1. They'll be thrown in the slammer if they do.
2. The revere the values for which it stands, and will not descrate a
   meaningful symbol of these values.
In (2), we can look at the (very rare) individuals who *do* burn the
flag, and determine for ourselves if they have a valid point to convey.  In (1), we'll never know.
For Congress to deny the freedom to burn the flag is a desecration of what
the flag stands for - a descration of the flag by the government itself.

NOT a press release, but true.
  Framingham,MA , June 16, 1997
      Process Software surpasses Anguilla in code breaking challenge.
  The small software firm of Process Software has searched through more   than 25,600,000,000,000 code keys as part of an independent effort to   break a DES encrypted message.  This is in response to a challenge by RSA
  Inc to show that DES 56 bit keys are not large enough given the
  rapid advances in computing technology.  As of June 16th, the entire
  US military effort, represented by Internet machine names ending in
  ".mil" in the Deschall statistics pages, has searched fewer keys.   Anguilla host names end in ".com.ai".  This represents 5965 2^32 key segments, or 0.035% of the total keyspace. We've got a long way to go.
It's worth noting that the DESChall people claim to have now
searched over 23% of the keyspace, and at the current rate will have searched the whole thing about 3 months from now.
They have not released their source code for independent evaluation. I for one would feel a lot more comfortable with
DESChall if there was at least some outside review, even if
no general release is made.

@_subject: DES: Thank you! 
Well Done!
     My congratulations go out to Rocke Verser, Mike Sanders, and all of the other people who developed code and/or ran
clients for the DES challenge. The crack comes roughly at the
time I predicted when I first proposed the challenge, and
at a very opportune moment to influence action in the US
     I first proposed the challenge on Oct 1, 1996, in a posting to the cypherpunks mailing list: "Can we kill single DES?". Later that month, at the suggestion of Ron Rivest, I approached Jim Bidzos of RSA Data Security Inc. with the idea. From the start, RSA was enthusiastic, and sponsored the challenge to the tune of      I wrote some of the earliest key search routines, and
invented a technique to reduce the key schedule generation
from 80% of the total work to less than 5% - a technique which
was universally adopted by key search engine writers.
     I and others also worked on the other major part - the DES round. My initial version was substantially faster than any
previously existing Intel version, but later  Sven Mikkelsen of
Danemark found substantial improvements over my code.
     Sven, Rocke, and others also invented techniques to speed up
the search by reducing the number of DES rounds which needed to
be performed; I had reduced the original 16 to 14, but they got
it down to under 12.
     The upshot of this was that searching for keys became faster
than straightforward encryption or decryption with a single key.
Single DES can be cracked for under $10,000. Any system in which a single DES key protects more than $10,000 in assets is inadequate. Thus, one $10,000 message, or even 10 bank
cards with $1000 in their accounts, becomes a tempting target (some banking systems use the same DES key for many cards). Future cracks can only get faster. Processor speeds continue
to climb, and the number of available computers increases
similarly; thus, the number of available cycles more than
doubles every year - and the cost of a cracked key halves.
This was probably the *least* efficient way to crack DES;
Wiener and others have shown that machines can be built that
will crack DES far faster and cheaper, but the method used
won because it used existing resources, with no significant
upfront development costs.
No enterprise which wishes to use or offer security should consider single DES from this point on. If this crack does
anything, it demonstrates that the US Government's offers
to permit the export of single DES are worthless. Even without formal organization, distributed computing on
the Internet can muster awesome cpu power - I estimate about
half a million MIP years were used (see below).
The following is a very rough calculation, there are lots of 1. DESChall searched 25% of the keyspace - other efforts got
about the same, so we checked roughly 2^55 keys
2. I'm assuming that most search engines used roughly the same
number of operations per key checked, regardless of processor. 64 bit machines could do better, especially with bitslice 3. The Pentium code is highly optimized, and thus is executing
roughly 2 instructions per clock cycle.
Lets do the numbers.
from the DESChall benchmark page:
Dual Pentium 200 MHz ......... 2.003M keys per second = 200MHz is roughly 400MIPs, due to Pentium's dual pipelines.
-> 1 Mkey/sec = 400 MIPs, or roughly 400 instructions per key.
   (this sounds about right, from my own DES Intel assembly work).
2^55 keys = 3.6*10^16 keys
* 400 = 1.44*10^19 instructions
= 1.44*10^13 million instructions.
= 457,000 MIP years used in the calculation.
Lenstra has stated that, in the factorization of RSA-130:
"we would have spent about 500 mips years (i.e., 10% of the computing time spent on the 129-digit QS-record) if we had done all the sieving on average workstations with at least 24 megabytes of memory" (from This suggests that cracking DES used roughly 2 orders of
magnitude (ie, 100x ) more CPU than RSA-129, which I suspect
makes it a record for the largest calculation ever performed.
What next?
Two targets suggest themselves:
1. 56 bit RC5.
2. RSA 135
1. 56 bit RC5.
The earlier efforts on 40 and 48 bit RC5 suggest that keysearch
for RC5 is substantially slower than DES - perhaps 5-10 x slower. It's probable that the clients have not been fully optimized.
RSA has another $10,000 prize for this crack.
2. RSA 135 We used about 1000x the cpu needed for the RSA 130 factorization.
I'm not sure how the best current factorization systems scale
with the modulus size (Rivest, Lenstra?) but I suspect that it's
less than linear. If this is so, then RSA 135 may be doable. RSA135
is roughly comparable to a 448 bit key. RSA also has a prize for
this factorization.

@_subject: Comparing Cryptographic Key Sizes II 
There is still quite a bit of confusion about the difficulty
of factoring 512 bit moduli. I'll try to clear that up.
Here's the sequence of events:
 We cracked a DES key, searching about 1/2 the keyspace. I used the
published speeds of the clients, and my own knowledge of the Pentium
processor, to estimate that this search used about 457,000 MIPS  In his usenet note announcing the factoring of RSA-130 using GNFS,
(General Number Field Sieve) Lenstra estimates that the effort was about 500 MIPS years, '1/10th of the effort for RSA-129, using QS
(Quadratic Seive)'.
Bruce Schneier, in AC2, has a table giving 28,000 MIPS years as the
time to factor a 512 bit number using GNFS.
 I wrote to Lenstra, asking him how big a modulus he thought could
be factored with 1000x the power he used for RSA-130.
 Lenstra responded that that power should be able to factor a 600
bit modulus using GNFS, but that the sieving clients would need about
128 M of memory, and that the matrix problem would be 'very big' (he
did NOT say impossible).
 RSA-129 was factored using QS, on clients with as low as 8M of memory. In the paper "The Magic Words Are Sqeamish Ossifrage", in
which the factorization of RSA-129 using QS is described, the authors
(including Lenstra) estimate the QS could factor a 512 bit modulus
in about 500,000 MIPS years.
 I wrote to Lenstra, asking if QS could be used instead, to deal with
the memory and matrix problems. Lenstra responded to the effect that
it could.
So, to summarize:
Using GNFS, on clients with 128M of memory, you could factor a 512
bit modulus in 28,000 MIPS years. With 500,000 MIPS years, you could
factor a 600 bit modulus.
Using QS, in 500,000 MIPS years you could factor a 512 bit modulus on
machines with modest memory requirements.
The effects of memory speed and bandwidth would slow things down

Actually, around Redmond, gray skies are much more common.
Really guys, If you want to attack Authenticode (and I personally consider it a bandaid on a dangerous system), then stealing or
buying the key is not the approach to take.
I see two possible approaches to prove it's weakness.
1. If they are using RSA, factor the public key. This depends on it's
length. Considering the amount of cpu people seem to be able to muster for distributed cracks, etc, I suspect that 512 bit keys will soon be vulnerable (equiv = RSA 155).
2.  Write a Trojan Horse ActiveX control which disables the Authenticode checking, then covers it's tracks.
No, I'm not working on either of these.

His main arguement rests on the fact that the later versions
of PGP use RSAREF, rather than Phil's own code.
As support of the first claim, he claims:
I'm not sure what you're referring to with "RSA" here - is it the algorithm or the company? If it's the algorithm, you may or may not have the intellectual capacity to verify it yourself - if you don't you have no business telling us it's compromised, and if you do, either publish the problem (and claim your 15 minutes of fame), or admit there is no hole you are aware of. There are plenty of people on this list who can follow the math, even
if you can't.
If it's the company, then you are either ignorant or lying. RSA has *not* had a good relationship with the USG, as those who have been following the matter over the years know well. Most recently, you will notice that it has licensed some of it's patents to a Japanese
chip maker in an effort to avoid problems with US export restrictions. Is this the action of a USG patsy?
PGP 2.5 was released in March 1994, about a year after Phil was
indicted. It took until January 1996 for the indictment to be dropped;
nearly another two years. If a deal was struck, why did it take so
long? The dismissal of Phil's persecution was almost certainly due to
(a) the approach of the statute of limitations, and (b), the very high probability that he would be found innocent. if they took him to trial. The government simply ran out of legal pretexts under which to harass him.
Now that your supporting assertions have been shown to be flawed,
let's return to the original claims.
1. "PGP => 2.5 has been compromised."
2. "It is far, far easier to 'build' a back-door, than to 'find'     one."
The problem, TM, is that we have full source code, and anyone
with the intelligence and knowledge required can check it
independently. PGP and RSAREF are both distributed as source.
There is not one byte of instructions or data that have to be accepted on faith - no precompiled libraries, no mysterious
DLLs or ActiveX controls. If there is a backdoor, show it to us.
Your second claim, that it is easier to build a backdoor than to
find one, is true but not pertinant. Let's try an analogy.
1. You buy a house from a builder. You, being paranoid, wonder if
the builder has included a secret door to enable him to
enter the house without your permission. You investigate what you
can, but in the end are left with some doubts.
2. You buy a set of blueprints from the builder, and examine them
carefully for weaknesses. You then buy a plot of land of your choice, hire the workers you want, get materials from any supplier you wish. You supervise the construction yourself down to the last detail. Others who have purchased the same blue prints include trusted independent architects and construction engineers, who concur with you thatno hidden back doors can be found in the design. At this point, how worried are you that the builder has left himself an unauthorized entry?
The situation with PGP >=2.5 is like the second scenario, not the What it comes down to "TM" is: Put up or shut up. You can't spread
FUD in a situation where there is no unknown to Fear, no Uncertainty
to deal with, and no Doubt that we have all the knowledge we need.
Respond in a substantive manner. So far, you've avoided doing so.

[problems with this approach deleted]
I'm a little confused by your use of the term 'SSL proxy'. Netscape defined an extension to HTTP to allow SSL traffic through a firewall:
the encrypted request is prepended (in clear) with the actual destination IP address and port. The firewall proxy then opens a TCP/IP channel to the actual destination/port, and blindly relays packets
between the actual destination and the browser until one side or the
other shuts down the link.
The proxy does no encryption or decryption - in fact, it requires no crypto code at all. (BTW: this what setting the 'security proxy' field in Netscape is all about).
The scheme has some drawbacks - there is no provision for chaining proxies. - the server can't determine the source browser's IP - it only sees   the proxy's IP address. This makes it more difficult to filter   requests based on source ID.
- the proxy has no idea of the actual URL requested - proxies which
  want to filter or log requests based on URL can't do so.
Or are you talking about something entirely different? Peter Trei

Agreed. I'm getting progressively more turned off by
Tim's developing survivalist/confrontationist stance. I fear that

for common 'cypherpunk' viewpoints. The type of armed, ingrained bitterness towards all aspects and
manifestations of government he displays is hazardous to himself
personally; I can envisage a simple traffic stop turning violent.
Worse, he's demonizing his opponent. This is counter-productive.
It's better to try to understand the actual underlying goals of your opponent - it gives you a much better chance at turning
him into your ally, or avoiding a conflict if you cannot do that.
If he can be neither turned nor avoided, the minimum action to
change the status quo should be used.
If Tim truly maintains that a 'war' is underway between people
like him and the government, than he would be in no position to complain if Clinton's men treated his little hilltop retreat
as an enemy outpost. For all his pride in it's defensibility, they could take it out in seconds if respect for due process, the Constitution, and a real concern for the lives of innocents did not stop them.
The policies of the current gang in power are bad, and may well

1. You must assume that any well-heeled opponent will have built a Wiener engine, so the time to brute a DES key can be measured in hours, rather than days. A ciphertext-only attack is only a little
harder than a known-plaintext attack.
But that doesn't stop us from doing the calculation anyway.
The fastest DES cracker I'm aware of (Bryddes) currently claims 615,000 keys/sec on a Pentium 120.
The sandia machine is acheiving 1.06 Tflops with 7264 processors.
The processors are 200 MHz Pentium Pros. (The Mflop rate is lower than the MHz rate). They plan to have 9200 of them when it's 615k * 200/120 = 1.025Mkps
(it'll actually be a bit higher on a Pro)
1.025M * 9200 = 9.430Gkps
(2^56 = 7.2E16)/9.43E9 = 7.6 Msec
= 88.44 days
Thats a conservative, upper limit, not a SWAG.
Speeds would be much higher on a 64 bit machine. I'm very curious to
see how bitslice DES would run on an MMX Pentium, which has some
64 bit registers.
40 bit encryption is a bad joke = it would take about 2 min on this machine for 40 bit DES

the Soviet Union fell apart. The plutonium cores of thermonuclear devices have a limited shelf
life - he claimed 6 years, which jibes with what I've heard from
other open sources. Fission products build up in the cores which can poison a chain reaction. Thus all Pu based devices need to have
the cores periodically removed and replaced with new ones, while the
old ones have to go through a non-trivial reprocessing stage to remove the fission products. Thus, a nuke left on the shelf eventually turns into a dud. The time
since the Soviet Union fell (which is the upper limit of the last time these particular 'suitcases' could plausibly have been repacked)
is long enough ago that they are now either duds or becoming unreliable (I don't know if the degredation results in gradually

I've heard of two methods; one is to transmit the data as a high
frequency FM signal along the wire. The other is to use power lines
which include an optical fibre. Both have problems. The FM signal has difficulty going through transformers (there are lots of transformers, with the final step-down usually occuring at a pole-top near your house). Also, you have to be very careful about
isolating the data output from the power line: an error could send
110VAC into your serial board. I haven't heard of this method being
used on a wide scale, but it might work as a LAN.
The optical method may actually be implemented. Putting a few optical
fibers into a power line is cheap, easy, and widely done. The
idea was originally that power companies could read your electrical meter remotely, but the bandwidth available is gross overkill. Thus they are also thinking of adding Cable TV, telephony, and data services.
There are still problems. You are basically building a data network on top of the power grid, and the topologies don't really match up.
Also, employees have to be trained to splice optical fibers and
install routing equipment, and millions of miles of power lines and
hundreds of millions of junctions need to be replaced or reworked.
There was a rosy article about this in Wired a few years ago. I have
heard nothing since.

I conceed that it may not be the Pu decay products that cause the
limited shelf life of thermonuclear weapons; I suspect that it may
be components of the 'pit', which produces the initial burst of neutrons to kick of the reaction (the pit is effectively a small
fission bomb). This 'pit' may contain tritium (pit design is a very
well guarded secret, and I've seen very little about it in the open
literature). I disagree. A terrorist could obtain a bomb by being given it, stealing it, or buying it as a turnkey system. However, I suspect that anyone with the facilities to recondition one of these
weapons could also build one from scratch. I don't know if it's comforting or worrying knowing that these
devices degrade - any in the hands of terrorists have a limited
time that they are a threat, but that fact may pressure a terrorist
to 'use it or lose it'.

The backbone cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of getting fiber
into every house in the country. Building a few optical fibers into a cable as it is being manufactured is cheap and easy, as is using fiber-equipped
cable if you are installing new lines, or replacing old ones
for other reasons (installation costs are usually far higher than the cost of the line itself). It's hooking up all the fibers into a meaningful network that gets expensive, which was my point.
