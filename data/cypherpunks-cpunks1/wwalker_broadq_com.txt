@_subject: [hangar18-general] Q: A question of security vulnerability 
sudo is actually almost never secure.  As you imply, with line 1 bob can
do _anything_ just like line 2.
Here are some more less obvious examples where bob can do _anything_
1. bob pine
2. bob vi
3. bob chown
4. bob chmod
With any of the 4 above, bob can do anything.
With 1 or 2, bob can run any command from within the program (! is
allowed in vi, and if you set $EDITOR to vi before running pine...)
In 3 and 4, bob can make setuid programs or change perms on /etc and put
his own passwd/shadow files in place.
Bottom line, if you give someone sudo access you should tgrust them to
be root, OR you should only allow them to run very specific
_scripts/binaries_ that you wrote for them specifically (e.g.
chown_files_to_others_in_his_primary_group, restart_lpd,
restart_httpd...)  And here you still have to be careful about these
