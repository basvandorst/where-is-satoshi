Okay...  So, you're writing cypherpunks to get somebody to explain Caps Lock
and apostrophes to you, right?

I HAVE 2 LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN MOLESTED BY THEIR STEP
GRANDFATHER. THEY HAVE  TALKED TO BY THE SHERIFFS DEPT. AND THEY WERE
CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO ORAL SEX, BUT NOT ACTUALLY
PENETRATED. THE DEPUTY SAID  THE CASE WORKER WAS WALKING ON THIN ICE, AND IT
PROBABLY WOULD NOT HOLD UP IN COURT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY FOUR AND FIVE
YEARS OLD. WHEN I CALLED TO SEE IF THIS MAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED, THEY TOLD ME
IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I AM WILLING TO GO TO JAIL BEFORE LETTING THESE
GIRLS GO BACK TO THIS SITUATION. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY THIS. I
CANT BEAR FOR THEM TO HAVE TO EVER HAVE TO SEE THIS PERSON AGAIN, BUT MY
SON, THEIR FATHER DOES NOT HAVE CUSTODY. AT THE MOMENT HE HAS THEM, BUT
THEIR MOTHER WILL NOT COMPLY WITH DFS SO THEY CAN GET COUNSELING. THE DFS
HAS SENT THE MEDICAID CARDS SO THEY CAN GET THE COUNSELING, BUT SHE HAS TO
SIGN THE CONSENT, AND SHE WONT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE DOCTORS FOR AN
EXAM, BECAUSE SHE ALSO WONT SIGN FOR THAT. THE LAWS OF THIS LAND ARE
COMPLICATED, AND IM SURE THAT SOMEWHERE THE REASON FOR THIS CONSENT FROM THE
MOTHER, IS APPROPRIATE, BUT AT THIS TIME, I AM FRUSTRATED THAT THEIR MOTHER
AND HER NEW HUSBANDS FAMILY ARE ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE LAW . WE NEED TO
PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ANYONE THAT IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR BEST
INTEREST. THESE ARE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND DESERVE TO HAVE A FUTURE,
UNMOLESTED.  CATHERINE M. HALL GRANDMOTHER   BOSSLION

@_subject: cell phone anonymity 
In the US they are now selling prepaid phones in electronics stores,
computer stores, and -- my favorite -- some Blockbuster movie rental
locations.  You go in, pick up a box, pay cash at the register, and you're
done.  No information is required at the time of purchase.  Refills
available from various retailers depending upon your service company.
Again, you walk in, pick one up, pay cash, and leave.

Please post the actual experiences about obtaining a
pre-paid cell phone (aka "mobile" in the less
world) without revealing any (correct) identifying
such as address, telephone no, name, etc.
I know that it can be done in Canada. Unsure about US,
UK and the rest of europe.

You can always chat with MS about "fixing" the password problems.  If
your child is a minor, you've got the right to access that information
(and depending upon your state, maybe even if he isn't).

files.  program work. program? passwords, Mrs. Banks  Mrs. Banks - Cypherpunks is a large, noisy mailing list.
In addition to talking about cryptography, privacy, and the effects
on economics and politics of being able to talk and conduct business
without government interference, and random other topics,
we end up receiving lots of mail from people pretending to be
teenagers asking us about bombs, hacking, credit cards, etc.
Some of them are clueless kiddies who think we'll tell them
how to steal stuff to make bombs so they can be rilly kewl d00ds,
some of them are annoying kiddies who've found they can stir up
lots of annoyed discussion by posting provocative or clueless questions,
and some are probably cops who think they can stir up business
by finding people doing stuff with Bombs and Computer Crime
that make good headline material.*
So don't be surprised if readers like Blank Frank take you for one of these three categories (start at the middle and work your way
and either gives you the flames you're looking for or
the abuse you deserve if you're one of the clueless types.
Your message could be perfectly legitimate, but it's just
dripping with troll bait....  We haven't had anybody
saying their somebody's Mom who wants to break into her kid's
machine before, but hey, there's a first time for everything.
On the other hand, many of us were once teenagers who had
parents who didn't understand us (what a surprise, eh?)
and a request saying "I don't trust my kid and I want to crack
his passwords to spy on him" isn't guaranteed to get more
sympathy for you than for your kid.
Anyway, that being said, there are only a few reasons for having
lots of Microsoft password files around.  One is that your son has
lots of logins on your home computer, either for his friends to use
or because he's creating lots of different identities for himself.
The former is something you may want to talk to him about,
depending on how much control you want to have over that computer
(is it his bedroom game machine or are you running the family business
on it?)
Another is that he has logins of his own on multiple machines using
Microsoft-style logins.   That's kind of odd - is he running a bunch
of web pages on FrontPage-based servers, or is he cracking into
corporate machines?
The "17 passwords" is pretty close to a magic number, which is the
of "access devices" it takes for possessing stolen/cracked passwords
to become a US Federal crime.  I forget if the number is 15,
in which case by asking us to crack them you're asking us to
commit a Federal crime (remember the discussion about cops trying
to win friends and influence headlines through entrapment?),
depending on whether you have authorization to access the machines
that those passwords apply to (if you give us permission to crack the
passwords for your own machine, it's not a crime, but if they're
the passwords for your kid's publishing accounts on commercial porn
that might be criminal, and if they're for accounts your kid's
trying to break into, or if you're really the kid or a cop,
it could be criminal.)  So if you're thinking about breaking into your kid's machine,
because you don't trust him, yes, you've got some relationship
problems you'll have to deal with.  Not much different from asking
your kid where he went and having him say "Out" - either you go
ask all the neighbors where he went because he won't tell you,
or you work on the relationship, or you hire a private detective
to track him, just as you could probably hire Access Data or somebody
to break his password files, if you were willing to risk criminality.
I'd recommend going for the relationship....
*  (Perhaps some are even good cops trying to do what they think is their job by stopping clueless kiddies from posting dangerous inaccurate
information where more clueless kiddies will find it.  We do have some cops and Feds on the list that are open about it, and they're good folks we go shooting with :-)

Turn it off in Tools->Options->E-mail Preferences->Tracking.  The
capability to request receipts has been in the software for several
years.  Some large percentage of users consider it a feature; you can
turn it off completely if you're not one of them.
