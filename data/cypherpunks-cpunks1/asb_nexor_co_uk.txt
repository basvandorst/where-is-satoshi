@_subject: a hole in PGP 
Well I told you that I verified the results of the key generation in PGP by testing the primality of p and q and the validity of the key by testing ed = 1 mod (p-1)(q-1).  That bit works, period.
You seem to be in some doubt about the random starting point for the prime
searching.  Entropy for the random number generator is collected from the
user's keystrokes and is mixed into the random pool.  PGP is very careful
about how much entropy it attaches to one keystroke and makes sure that
the user is prompted to press more keys if it thinks it has not got
enough.  The random pool is itself stirred periodically by using MD5 to
"encrypt" it.  This encryption is made strictly one way by using the first
64 bytes of the pool as the key, these 64 bytes are destroyed after use. Now, amongst other times the pool is stirred both before and after use.  So, recovering any given state of the pool (i.e. finding the random starting point for a prime search) has to be equivalent to reversing the MD5 transform.  There is no known way to do this.

I'll back up the disassembly theory.  I've done it myself once when I lost some of my own source code from years previous and had to get out the dissassembler.  Very painful work which resulted in a first set of source much like the "S1" sample posted here.  Only difference was that I went back over the "first draft" after verifying it and cleaned it up The poster either does not know 'C' or thinks that a cleanup will reveal his/her style.

@_subject: Why DES in IPSEC ESP? 
I suppose this is really addressed at Perry:
Why was (single) DES chosen as the algorithm for the ESP part of IPSEC? If someone's IP traffic is being monitored and collected offline by some
agency then they're going to get about a couple of hours of security while
the special purpose key search hardware kicks into action.  I know other
algorithms can optionally be used, but surely it would have been better to
have a second, stronger algorithm specified mandatory as well. - Andy

Dave Byers found it with his MasPar while searching the space that Eric had left out.  The MasPar was getting 1.4M keys per second and hence could search the entire 40 bit keyspace in about 9 days anyway.

The project must be of type "ssl" (look at the properties box to make sure).  ssl is the only search engine currently built in to the client, more will be added as challenges are planned.
Piete: I notice that you've renamed the original challenge to "sslold" and the test to "sslck" which causes the client to not recognise them!  Any chance you can put them back to "ssl" so folks can test their clients?

@_subject: yabc 
These aren't changes to the protocol, which just defines what a client and
a server should understand.  The "local" servers that only do ACKs are
designed to collect up reponses from a local client farm and then feed
them en-masse to the central server, using SKSP.
To answer your second point, there are ideas being floated around between Adam, Piete and myself as to the "next step".
I had the idea that the load on the central server might be reduced by
having a system where clients register their availability times, PGP key
and computing horsepower to the server, and the server calls the client at
the start of an available period and hands it a keyspace that fills the
time available.  PGP signatures on all exchanges would authenticate the
parties and it would be impossible for large keyspaces to be requested in
error or malicously.  Un-ack'd keyspaces would wrap around.  This idea
needs quite a bit more coding and people have expressed reservations about
just how much load would be saved.
On the other hand, Piete has a proposal that also uses PGP signatures and
retains the existing protocol.  The central server would remain as is, but
would only accept ACKs from servers that it trusted via a signed PGP key. There would be a small number of such second level servers, perhaps one in
each country.  This hierarchy of trust extends downwards as far as is
necessary in each country with clients being at the leaf nodes of the
tree.  This method spreads the load worldwide in a very effective manner,
with the final central server only receiving calls from a handful of other
servers.  This idea needs less coding than mine and solves the immediate
problem. We're still talking, and listening...

@_subject: general RC4 key searcher: optimisations anyone? 
The following program is the part of my RC4 key search program that
actually does the searching, adapted into a small speed test.  It is
designed to handle any size key, with any number of unknown bits, in any
position within the key.  There are, of course, problems with it in its current form:
1.  It's too slow.  I get 50% of the performance of the bruterc4.c on     utopia.hacktic.nl (~9500/sec on a 60Mhz Pentium and ~12000/sec on a     Sparc 20)
2.  It can only handle bit offsets of 0 (i.e. the lower n bits of the key     are unknown).  I'm unsure of a really fast way of generalising this     to any (contiguous) n bits.
3.  There are probably bugs.
The code is included below.  Does anyone have any comments?

When I stuck that comment in I had in mind the message that appeared here in the list from someone at maspar.com, where their machines make our workstations look rather pedestrian.  Agreed, though, Alpha's are nice (I'm typing this message on one).
The Pentium's integer performance in general is very good, right up there with the more expensive Sparc according to the figures I saw in one of the linux newsgroups a while back.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the relative performance of its FPU, Intel needs to do a lot of work there to catch up.

Your scheme should be OK.  If you'd chosen the same IV for each sector then identical sectors would encrypt the same.  If I remember rightly then having a known IV only affects the security of the first block, after that the ciphertext chaining comes into effect.

[an addition to Piete's follow-up]
We should be ready to get going very soon.  Clients and servers are working together and just need a little more testing to make sure they are better than perfect :-)
The protocol we're going to use is designed to be highly general and can be used to attempt a brute force attack on any crypto algorithm.  More on this later, but we've had a few thoughts...

I've personally pulled apart the innards of both MIT pgp 2.6.2 and the non-MIT pgp 2.6.2i in order to generate large primes and full RSA keys.  There are no hacks in MIT pgp that cause it to generate weak keys.

As I'm sure you know, PGP picks its primes by choosing a random starting point and testing each odd number upwards until it gets a probable prime.  The random number generator used to seed this search is mixed using MD5 which gives a uniform 1/0 distribution.  I'd hazard a guess that the chances of a start point having so many contiguous 1's as to be close to 2^N is so vanishingly small that it's more likely a non-prime would pass the probabalistic tests!
I suppose if I were really paranoid I'd feed in fixed starting points
for the search to MIT PGP and PGP 2.6.2 to make sure that they come out with the same keys.

As a matter of interest, how long did it take you to generate this, and
with what hardware?  I left a 120Mhz Pentium searching for 15 hours
overnight without any success (it managed to eliminate 10 candidate primes
as not strong in that time). - Andy

@_subject: VISA and Microsoft STT Specs available 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  NOTE: this document covers the International version of the STT   protocol, which includes DES encryption of all financial data, direct   RSA encryption of bank card account numbers, and 40 bit RC4 encryption   of the purchasing order form contents and receipt.  A US/Canada version   of the protocol with triple-DES encryption of the order, receipt, and   all financial data and direct RSA encryption of bank card account   numbers will be documented and published in the near future.
So it looks like single DES is now OK for export, at least it seems to be in this case where its application is strictly limited to "financial data".

@_subject: Hal's Third Challenge? 
If you mean STT, they're using a hotch-potch of methods in the exportable version.  40 bit RC4 protects the purchase order form and receipt, single DES-CBC protects the financial data and they claim that direct RSA protects the credit card numbers although this is far from clear from the specification (can someone clarify this?).
So you're going to need brutedes and/or some network factoring code (the smallest modulus they use is 512 bits which, realistically we do not have a chance of attacking in a reasonable time).

Very interesting indeed.  With RC4 the bulk of the time is in key setup, so if they could do two setups in parallel then the total time to search a double-encrypted 40 bit keyspace would not be that great.
I suppose they could even 'weight' the number/power of processors assigned
to key setup such that the setup ran as fast as the trial decryptions,
then just proportionally increase their number until you get an acceptable
search time.  I know precious little about parallel processing so this
could be idle speculation. Can the same parallelisation be applied to other popular ciphers?
