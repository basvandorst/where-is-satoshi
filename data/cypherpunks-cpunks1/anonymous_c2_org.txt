@_subject: Why emoney?  Why not a web of debt? 
Oh... Nice...  I hadn't thought of that...
  And since I would only make the promise to the few people that I am
connected to in the debt-trust web, this is doable.  I doubt I could
convince all of you that I was good for $10, but I bet there are a few
readers on this list that I *could* convince.  They would be able to
convince a few others that _they_ are worth $10, etc.
  This system might even dodge the laws governing banking in various
jurisdictions ... though I doubt it.  It quacks, waddles, and water
runs off its back...
  Noyb
