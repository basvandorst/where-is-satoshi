@_subject: New Middleman Mixmaster 
I have just set up a new mixmaster with the following key. It's purely a
middleman remailer, and hence will only forward mail to other mixmasters.
If it's used as the last link in the chain, or you send a request for the
key or statistics information, this will be sent out via a randomly chosen
remailer. Because all mail to the remailer goes through the nymserver as
well as my system, you should expect latency of a couple of hours.
Here is the public key for Medusa Remailer
