No, Carl, it was when you started spamming people that I accused you of
spamming. Or are you saying that the dozen or so spams (aimed primarily
at me and my site) that magically appeared today from *.sk.sympatico.ca
IP addresses at the same time as your latest set of abusive return mail
is a coincidence?
My loopholes aren't as large as you thought they were. They led quite
clearly back to you on this one.
