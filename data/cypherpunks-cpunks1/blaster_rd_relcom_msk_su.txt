I want to conect to  cypherpunks  mailing list. What  I
must made  for  conect  to  this list? Do you welcame people
from Russia?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Breaking DES 
It can be right, but we can use some intermidiant operation. For example:
DES(randomHeader+DES(zip(DES (text, k1)), k2), k3)
        DES (text, k) - encryption text "text" by key k;
        randomHeader - some good random text;
        zip - some archiver.

@_subject: Monitor radiation overlooking. 
I  read   about   overlooking  of  monitor   radiation.
Introder   can   scan   the  electron-beam  radiation   from
electron-gun. He  simple  transmit  this   radiation to self
electron-gun  and sinchronize  frequance. This  method  work
with b/w  monitor.  The  overlooking of  color-monitor  more
dificult - introder will see 4 gradation of gray  (all  guns
off, work one, two, three guns). But  we can select  spesial
colors (red-blue or blue-green) and  allways will  work only
one (or two) guns. In this way  introder will  see  dark (or
light) gray screen without any information!!!
     Is it  corect?  Do now present more improve overlooking
Some words about DES - I spoke with one cryptoanalisyst from
KGB and he sow, that for number crypto algotitm c(key, text)
(key is keyLength tall) present f(key, text), that for all
key1 and key2 present key with length keyLength, that
c(key2, c(key1, text))==f(key, text).
He also say, that now present f() for c()=des(), more f() wery
like des().
That`s why for decrypting of des(k1, des(k2, ... des(kN, text) ... ))
we must try 2^56 keys with spetial function.

Sorry for my poor English. I want to saw, that DES is`t group. We can`t say,
A k1, k2: E k0, that des(k2, des(k1, text))=des(k0, text)
        (A mean "for all", E mean "exist");
or: E k1, k2: A k0, that des(k2, des(k1, text))!=des(k0, text)
I saw, that:
E f(k, text): A k1, k2: E k0, len(k0)=len(k1)=len(k2), that
des(k2, des(k1, test))=f(k0, text)
f() like des(), but f() is not des()!!!
My friend saw, that introder must try only 2^56 keys for des(des()).
Once more, sorry for my poor English.
PS I am sorry for my stupid letter about PGP randomizer.

@_subject: TEMPEST and Public key programs 
Please, send this paper direct to me.
Exuse me please, but I don`t see this man about two week! I also can`t
ask this man about all (I like fredom :( ). As security men saw: "if smaller
know then better sleep".
DES is`t group - f() only like to DES (I think, that computing dificult of
f() like des() one).
I`ll ask he about this.
He made same program (LanCrypto). That why, I hear only bad words from
he. :) You can read about this program in cypherpunks.
cryptoanalisist from Russia) saw, that PGP has some weak places:
 - random number is`t "good" random number.
 - md5 has hole (but here man lapse into salence:( ).
 - PGP for DOS don`t have any anti-overloking tools.
BTW: LanCrypto play on last weakness: thay wrote litle resident DOS program.
This program crack PGP and than pgp sign (and check) only part of message.
LanCrypto public this resalt in buziness newspaper and show program on the big
computer-show. I think this is rough market, but it work well (as all, that
KGB made:))!!!
Now I know 3 powerful public-key Russian programs. All wrote by exKGB man:
- "LanCrypto" has vary fast algorithm, litle sign and several tools for anti-
  intruding.
- "Exelence" has number of anti-intruding tools and powerful cryptographic
  algorithms. This pakage also has inteligance hardware keys for prevent
  introding.
- "Blitc". The central bank try to use this program, but boys from LanCrypto
  find rough hole in hash function of this program and compromite this firm.
Now I contact with LanCrypto and Elias (autors of "Exelence"). I hope to
use thouse programs in my Computer Security Center. If you want I try to
write about this programs.
