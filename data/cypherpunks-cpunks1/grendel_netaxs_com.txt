@_subject: Random #'s via CD-ROM? 
Hello cypherpunks (first post):
random number generators, and some proposed hardware random number
generators. It seems to me that with the CD-ROM drive becoming
increasingly common these days, this could be exploited as a source of
randomness. For example:
the blank end of a sector, you should obtain random data (this is one
obvious problem with this method).
data to select another chunk of data from the CD-ROM (more random, yet we
still have a problem if we read the blank end of a sector...).
problem, namely if you read the unused portions of the cluster you will
get a random sample of all 0's. Not good.
about audio discs now, and I believe they can be made to read the binary
waveform data even if they don't understand the Red Book audio format. If
you have something really random/discordant (Ministry / NIN / Curve /
Sonic Youth / Pain Teens / Diamanda Galas / Coil / etc) and you take
samples of the waveform and play with them as described in _AC_, you could
get some pretty random samples.
the CD/CD-ROM that have actually been encoded....
works on my system and a friend's CD-ROM drive as well (for DOS machines).
I don't know about Mac / UNIX CD-ROM drive programming, sorry. =(
Post if there's wide enough appeal, or just email me.
music to use with this method. Please email me, don't post, as I'm sure
the rest of the list would dislike us discussing that in public ]

difficult to get an executable protection or encryption scheme to be undefeatable. If they have a debugger, a decompiler, and various other crypto-verification tools, they can defeat your scheme.

Given this kit and a OKI-900 cellular phone ($450 new, $300 used), you can do wonderous things. The kit connects to the phone and a standard PC RS-232 port, and lets you control the phone via your computer and do all sorts of things. The kit comes with a C API for controlling the phone, so you're not limited by what software comes with the kit. The author of the article listed these things that he programmed in a day or so:
channel is assigned, go to that channel and listen to the call.

all channels and recording the signal strength.

Review by Mr. Upsetter
        Any technology that combines radio, telephones, and computers is
sure to interest hackers. It's no wonder cellular telephony has received
so much attention. Now exploring the system is a little easier for us. A
company called Network Wizards has introduced an interface that allows
control of an OKI 900 cellular telephone from a DOS PC via the RS-232
port. Their Cellular Telephone Experimenters Kit (CTEK) consists of an
interface, four DOS executables for controlling the phone, and a C
function library so you can write your own programs. Also included on
disk are a user's manual, function library, and a short cellular
        The interface itself is contained in a small black box with a
DB25 connector on one end. A cable with a specialized plug for
connecting to the OKI is on the other end. Inside is a PIC16C54
microcontroller which converts data from the OKI to standard RS-232
data. The interface also has a mini stereo jack for connecting a
microphone and earphone.
        The DOS executables included with the CTEK allow you to perform
numerous functions. The MENU.EXE program allows you to change any of the
phone's five NAMs. (A NAM, or Number Assignment Module, consists of a
telephone number, system ID, initial paging channel, access overload
class, and group ID mark. This information, along with your ESN,
identifies your phone in the cellular system.) This program also allows
you to read, write, and edit the phone's 200 alphanumeric memories. The
TEST.EXE program, allows you to manually control the transmit and audio
functions of the phone. You can turn the transmitted on or off and set
the channel, SAT, and transmit power. You can also set the volume, mute
the transmit, or recieve audio as well as set the audio source to the
earpiece, sounder, or external jack on the CTEK interface. The TEL.EXE
program allows you to monitor the paging channel and displays all the
forward control channel messages. It also allows you to place and
receive a phone call while displaying the voice channel messages. The
KEYCON.EXE program simply allows you to press keys on the OKI from the
computer keyboard.
        The programs provided with the CTEK certainly expand on the
functionality of the phone. But to do the really fun stuff, you need to
write your own programs. Source code to TEL.EXE and KEYCON.EXE are
provided to get your started with the CTEK function library. Although my
C programming skills were a little rusty, I found it easy enough to
write programs with the library. I wrote a cellular scanning program
which had the following capabilities:
        * Scan for a paging channel and display the messages. If a voice
channel is assigned, go to that channel and listen to the call.
        * Scan voice channels and listen to active channels.
        * Scan OMNICELL channels and listen to active channels.
        * While listening to a call, display the voice channel messages.
        * Automatically follow handoffs.
        * Decode DTMF, change the volume or audio source.
        * Automatically mute the audio and stop monitoring when the call
is released.
        Other functions in the library allow you to send reverse channel
messages, get the received signal strength, control transmitter and
audio functions, and read the phone's memory. Overall the function
library is quite versatile. I had several other ideas for programs, for
        * Log all messages and call information for certain cellular
phone numbers. You could log paging channel messages, calls placed and
received, call durations, DMTF digits dialed, cell channels used, etc.
        * Create a "spectrum" display of the cellular band by scanning
all channels and recording the signal strength.
        * With a map of cell cites in your area, physically track a
phone as it moves from cell to cell.
        I had great fun exploring the cellular network while playing
with the CTEK. But this kit isn't for everyone. To get the most out of
CTEK, you need to write your own programs. The executables provided in
the kit really don't use the phone to its highest potential. Also, the
OKI 900 isn't the cheapest phone in the world. It goes for about $400 to
$450 new, perhaps $300 used if you can find one. Still, you could put
together a great cellular monitoring system comparable to the ones
designed for law enforcement for a few hundred dollars as opposed to a
few thousand dollars. The CTEK is best suited for monitoring the
cellular network rather than as a tool for fraud. You cannot change the
phone's ESN with the CTEK. In fact, the library function which lets you
send reverse control messages won't even let you send a bogus ESN.
        Overall, the CTEK is a well-designed product, both in hardward
and in software. While it's currently only available for the OKI 900,
Network Wizards promises a version for the OKI 1150 soon.

Regarding some specific criticisms by Mr. Nalbandian:
[1] If Joe ComputerUser does not know how to use his computer for more
than word processing and playing games, at this point, he probably doesn't
NEED PGP. If he knows enough to realize what little privacy he actually
has, he will go looking for security. With luck, he will run into someone
who can steer him towards PGP...
[2] The purpose of this list is not to insure that everyone has a copy and
knows how to use PGP (though most of us would consider that a worthwhile
goal). As it has been said more and more often, 'Cypherpunks write CODE!'.
This is a discussion group about the practicality and implementation of
specific forms of cryptography and cryptographic applications (digital
money, key servers, etc). [ This is not to belittle the political
content of the group, though. ] Groups like the EFF are interested in
helping new users to the Internet learn all about it, and are doing a good
job of it so far. If you are that concerned about the masses not knowing about
cryptography, try sending a note to the EFF (with the caps lock OFF!) and
ask them to include a section on privacy, cryptography and PGP in the next
version of the Big Dummy's Guide To The Internet. It's a start.
[3] Sending badly composed rants to seven hundred people and then
publically posting a response to a private message is not the way to be
taken seriously.

a patch file.
sure they haven't tried to sneak a backdoor into the binary and not the
going to be changing, I don't know how likely this is. Our best bet would
be to include RSAREF 2.0, which I believe can still decode earlier
messages, as well as the new RSAREF, and put in code to recognize which
version of PGP the message was created with and use the "apppropriate"
version of RSAREF.

So, they created the Clipper scheme, which is a compromise.

releasing the algorithm was *really* suspicious) or that the NSA can easily break 80-bit keys, so that the NSA can continue to have a leg up on all of the other agencies (ie they don't have to deal with the key escrow departments or other little trivial legal details).
80-bit keys are a joke for the NSA.

----- BEGIN EXCERPT -----
The 700 Club, March 8, 1995, 10:00 -- 11:30 AM
[ ... ]
PAT ROBERTSON: OK. Well, ladies and gentlemen, something a little bit more serious. You know, the Bible talks about a day when people won't be able to buy or sell except having a mark; a mark of what is called the beast. It's one of those things in Relevation that keeps coming up. Well, as technology increases, we see a little bit -- a little bit more. Now we've got digital cash that may on the way to your wallet, a card you can use for any kind of purchase, from health care to road tolls to pay-per-view TV. But are there hidden security dangers in this computerized wonder card? We've got a special report on this program. You don't want to miss it.
[ ... ]
ROBERTSON: Now that man [David Chaum!] is Jewish. I don't know whether he's speaking out of Relevations or not, but that is the scenario set forth ... in Relevation, that the -- the -- the cards are too -- too valuable to be lost, which means that -- that there has to be some other identification. And we just were speaking, prior to the program, about the possibility of, indeed, a tattoo that would carry -- just tiny little dots would carry -- all the information that is needed could be put on somebody's hand or wherever. It's -- it's that close, really. ... We've got a few years to go, but I -- I -- I -- I'm just -- and -- and the -- the -- the justification for all this is, `Well, we can't have people dealing drugs.' So let's -- in order to cut the drug dealers, let's take away the freedom and privacy of every other human being on the face of the earth, and that is a frightening prospect.

Not true. In the 700 Club transcript I have, David Chaum is interviewed, and the blinded digital cash he has invented is portrayed in a very positive light, as a way of enabling digital cash and avoiding the prophesies of Relevation.

A blatant lie.
Newsgroups: alt.online-service.compuserve,comp.org.eff.talk
[ ... ] Compuserve CEO Massey appeared on CNBC and said that Compuserve was
only obeying the (German) law.  However, the AP article makes it clear that there is no such German law--that there is only an investigation going on in Germany as th exactly what is on the internet.  Compuserve was not asked to censor anything, according to the AP article.  Compuserve has apparently used this episode as a excuse to do what it
was already predisposed to do, in my opinion.

police investigators searched CompuServe's networks and computers last
month for child pornography, but he would not say what they found.
   "We didn't threaten them with charges," Wick said.
   Arno Edelmann, a CompuServe product manager in Unterhaching,
Germany, said Friday that the company blocked access to 200
sex-oriented newsgroups in a portion of the Internet called Usenet.
   "It is perhaps an overreaction but we want to cooperate with the

ObCrypto: I've been working on a draft paper that puts forward a proposal to make Usenet articles uncancellable except by [1] the original author of the article or [2] the system admin who runs the NNTP server the article issued from.

@_subject: Domains, InterNIC, and PGP (and physical locations of hosts, to boot) 
The InterNIC (the company responsible for registering .COM, .EDU,
.ORG, and .NET domains) has had a great deal of trouble lately, with
people submitting malicious CHANGE DOMAIN requests (change admin or
technical contact, point root nameserver entries to rival ISPs, etc).
In response, the InterNIC has created "the Guardian project" which
delineates who has access and authorization to change data in the
InterNIC's record. Not much new cpunk relevance, but much of what has
been discussed here is very applicable to this project (digital
signatures, common access to databases, etc).
I'm not completely pleased with their implementation, but it will do
for now. They _do_ support PGP as an access controller within the
Guardian project, and they have purchased a copy from ViaCrypt for
this purpose. A good thing, says I. Check out their proposal:
    ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/internic/internic-gen-1.txt
ObGPS/cpunk/physical-location-of-machines: A recent IETF proposal would
create a new DNS record that encoded the physical location of a
machine, encoded in latitude and longitude. This would solve the
problem MIT has had in distributing PGP, i.e. where exactly is
unix5.netaxs.com? However, there's nothing to stop you from adding
records that say your machines are at the latitude and longitude of,
say, Fort Meade... ;-)
    ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1876.txt
Again, I'm not too sure of the viability of this proposal. Not on
effectiveness of proving true location -- it is more geared toward
"visual 3-D packet tracing" -- but simply because I have _no_ fricking
idea where our machines are (in terms of lat and long) to any degree
of accuracy. ("They're somewhere in PA." Brilliant, you can find that
out via WHOIS.) The document suggests using GPS to locate your true
location, but I'll be damned if my boss is going to spend $1,000 just
so I can have more DNS entries to maintain...
