if drugs were legal, they would be cheap, thus addicts could afford them
more readily.
this is easily seen in countries which do tolerate drugs.

have you ever seen a 120mm mortar up close? I worked with 4.2" mortars
in the army, and it took a squad to carry one around.

there's room for another organization I think. there are, in my opinion,
two reasons why the NRA is as effective as it is: it has a single issue
that it concerns itself with and it never compromises.
so what, in very few words and as clearly as possible, is our issue?

so is there a list of names of the people who voted against it? I use
the term "people" very loosely.
actually though, both the democrats and the republicans consider parts
of the constitution to be obsolete. they just differ amongst themselves
as to which part. I wish someone would find the elixir of youth and feed it to barry

here's something I found in my mailbox:
on the U.S. assets of 12 Middle East ``terrorist'' groups, the
White House said Tuesday.
    White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton had signed
an executive order ``to block the assets in the United States of
certain terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the
peace process'' in the Middle East.

Nidal, Black September, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, Kach,
the Palestine Liberation Front, and the Islamic Group, McCurry

officials from the Treasury, State and Justice departments and
the National Security Council.
the United States will also be blocked, McCurry said. He said
Clinton had also frozen the U.S. assets of 18 individuals
suspected of involvement in Middle East terrorism, but McCurry
did not name them.
midnight EST the same day, McCurry said. He said the president
acted under the authority of the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act.

Israel in recent days, and that's the impact of terrorism,''
McCurry said, referring to a weekend terrorist bombing that
killed 18 Israeli soldiers and a civilian. Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility for the bombing.
    McCurry said the decision was the result of a detailed and
lengthy review within the U.S. government of how to combat
terrorism. The goal was to make it harder for these groups to
finance their activities by cutting off their  U.S. sources of
support and blocking their access to the U.S. financial system,
he said.
McCurry said.

soon send the Congress a comprehensive anti-terrorism package
that would stregnthen our ability to prevent terrorist acts, to
identify those who perpetrate violent acts and bring them to
justice,'' McCurry said.

the president can do just about anything he wants with an executive
order. of course if he did certain things he would be likely to get
impeached, or challenged in the courts.
theoretically, what with being commander in chief of the armed forces,
the president can do anything he wants up to and including the declaration
of martial law.
I don't expect that to happen this year.
