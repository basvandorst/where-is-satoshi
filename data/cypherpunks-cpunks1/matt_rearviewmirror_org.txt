Yes. 802.11b.
Look at what these guys are doing. They even make their
software available. 802.11b, 11Mb/sec, up to 15 mile range with the right
antennae, no licensing costs. Sound good enough?

It's not worth the effort. It's not worth the effort. It won't make a
damn bit of difference.
Oh, fuckit.
Capitalism is a meritocracy. *Commerce* is simply a label for that class
of activities that include all forms of resource transfer from one
entity (person, company, nation, world) to another. Some of those are
meritocracies, such as capitalism. Others are not - true communism is
one example, almost any form of "planned economy", welfare. As for your definition of capitalism - lay the crack pipe *down*, and
slowly step away. Capitalism, pure and simple, is the idea that
competition and market forces will solve problems. Price of bread too
high? Someone will open a cheaper bakery. Too many bakeries for the
market? Those with the weakest support and poorest quality will fail.
That's all. Everything else is an add-on. It's a meritcracy because
emotion and sentiment are not supposed to enter into the equation -
either succeed or fail, based on how well you compete. Period. Reality
is not that simple, but then, reality seldom is.
Hello Mr. Pot, and how are you today? What's that? Who's black?
I'm beginning to think that Mr. Choate should never, ever, be allowed to
declare a discussion finished or claim to have the "last word".

Here's a better question, Tim.
Why are you upset about it?
I mean, there are two possibilities. Either this mailing list is for useful discussion, or it's not.
If it *is*, then you should *welcome* the statists, the communists, the apologists, the Klansmen, feminists, nazis, Libertarians of any sort, Democrats, Greens, Republicans... anyone with the intelligence to write a coherent statement. (One could even argue against *that* limitation, but I won't.) Certainly, you have your views, and you should be expressing them, and you should encourage and support others who agree with you. But if this list is to be in any way useful, then you have to actually do this where people who *disagree* can read it. Preaching to the choir makes you feel warm and fuzzy, perhaps, and it makes for a smooth sermon, but it doesn't do a whole lot of good.
Besides - what's the fucking point of supporting freedom of speech if you keep telling people to shut up? You're dangerously close to sounding like those cranks who claim they're being patriotic by attacking the Dixie Chicks for their speech.
If it's not for useful discussion, just let us know. We'll all leave, and you can continue spreading the good word to precisely nobody.
One of the worst things about this wonderful invention we call the Internet is that so many people choose to listen only to those they already agree with.

Bad analogy. It is more like a radio astronomy list being populated by astronomers who support both the constant-expansion ("open") universe model and those who support the eventual-collapse ("cyclic") universe model. Both groups are astronomers, but because they are both intelligent people who support different models, the models are constantly refined to prove one side or the other.
Not supported by current evidence. A few years ago, this list was highly interesting, and highly volatile. Populated by libertarians, anarchists, crypto experts, feds, political science students, scientists, cranks, gun nuts, gun control nuts, etc. Now? Looks like you've driven most of the interesting people away. Who's left? The ones who agree with you? Where's the fun in that?
Don't you get tired of talking into an echo machine?

Accepting your definition for a moment, your analogy is still flawed because it assumes one group is rejecting science altogether, where here the two groups simply arrive at different conclusions from the same data.
But in fact, I don't completely agree with your definition. A Cypherpunk is one who is interested in the technology and use of encryption, and the social and political effects thereof. One definition assumes a conclusion, one definition defines a group in search of a conclusion. And really, my question would remain valid in either case. IF this list is to be the home of any sort of useful discussion, then the discussion must include both sides of the issue. Otherwise you don't have discussion, you have dogma.
Statists and communists both would be included in politician, Republican, Green, Democrat, Libertarian, crank (though not only statists and politicians fit there) and gun control nut. Just pick the flavor that matches the label.
And being railed at as statists and communists. Oh, some interesting people have joined on the other side, as well - but again, what value in one-sided

All good choices. Add "Ender's Shadow" for an interesting twist on the original story. Terry Pratchett's stuff for a lighter satirical look, although he tends to be cynical about all sides of the debate rather than just one side.
And, of course, the classics as well - Gibbon, for example. Interesting question. Are they permitted to ask that we appreciate their vocabulary and literature? In reality, I suspect most people here have already read "their" literature, and rejected it as not logical or otherwise flawed. I did. And that makes it harder to respect the majority of them, because it's not really about their disagreement but simply that they're The challenge is to prove this and convince them, not to drive them away with the metaphorical equivalent of sticks.

Wrong-headed cypherpunks who must be corrected or destroyed, more than likely. But cypherpunks none the less.
After all, just because their end objectives and motives are completely and totally opposite to yours or mine does not mean there aren't significant contributions they could make for our benefit. Just as there are things that other, "correct" cypherpunks could do or have done which are or could be
