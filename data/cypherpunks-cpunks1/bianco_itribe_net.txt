Yes, it's still there!  8-)  I posted a note to this list a few months ago
announcing that I had set up such a service, and though we've only got a few reports I'm up to a couple o' hundred visitors a week.  To me, the amount
of activity indicates interest in the subject, but the lack of reports
tells me that either authors are not interested in contributing, it's too difficult to contribute, or they don't know about service.  I took some time this weekend and wrote a script to handle online submissions.
This should make things easier on the authors, I think.  If you have
a technical report, journal article or book you'd like to index in CTRS
(abstract only submissions are supported as well as full-text submission),
point your browser at:
If you try this, please let me know how you liked it.  I'm interested in making the submissions process as painless as possible.  As always, the main CTRS page is

@_subject: Searchable Crypto Paper Archive? 
[My apologies if this is a repost.  The original was posted a a couple of
days ago via a news gateway which may or may not have actually worked.]
I was trying to dig up some cryptography papers cited as references
today, when a thought hit me; there seem to be a fair amount of crypto
papers available on the Net, but they're pretty scattered.  Bell Labs
has some online, which is great!  The cypherpunks FTP archive has a
few, though you can't perform keyword searches against them.  In
short, it's hard to find papers unless you already know what you want
and where it might be.
Having had some experience in designing and implementing technical
report retrieval services, I naturally think there's room for
improvement here. 8-) What I have in mind is something like NASA's
NTRS ("NASA Technical Report Server",
), which I helped
design and implement at my last job.
The basic idea behind NTRS is that users submit a query to a sort of
"search multiplexer" which queries a list of selected databases,
merges the separate result sets and gives them back to the user.  The
results are typically bibliographic and abstract data about papers,
which contain links to the papers themselves if they are available
online, or ordering info if they're not.  From past experience, I
think this model could be applied here very successfully.
One way to accomplish this would be to establish an archive where
people could submit papers to be indexed.  Larger institutions (such
as Bell Labs) might run their own servers, so they would have control
of their own content but could still be searched via the multiplexer.
Users of the service could then search all the different archives they
were interested in with one simple query.
Anyway, this is what I'd like to see.  I'm willing to work on such a
system if there's enough positive feedback.  Does anyone else think
they'd like to use or contribute to such a system?

On Sep 6,  9:36, Timothy C. May sent the following to the NSA's mail
Thanks for the reply.  I think there are a few misconceptions, though.
  I've responded in place to some of your comments...
Hmmm... I guess I didn't specifically mention this point since it seemed
obvious to me, though I probably should have:  Papers should come from the
authors or the organization which holds the copyright.  I wouldn't be in
favor of accepting 3rd party submissions, for both copyright and
authenticty/integrity issues.
The model we've used so far is that the format of the papers is independant
of the bibliographic information which we index.  For example, the NASA
system I mentioned has papers in both HTML and Postscript formats.  The
abstracts (which are what's indexed) simply contain URLs, and don't really
care what the document types are.
In my experience, most of the target audience for technical papers has
access to a postscript previewer (for online viewing) and/or a postscript
printer, so postscript tends to be the format of choice.  Still, it can be
anything; text, PDF, scanned in TIFF files all have worked for us in the
Now that's a pretty good point.  Wonder if we could convince them to make
their papers available electronically? 8-)
But ignoring them, there still seem to be a fair amount of cryptography
papers published as technical reports by individual authors or
organizations.  These would be what I'd like to see in CTRS.
Another good point, but I think this could easily be marked down as an
issue to be worked on after the basic functionality is available.  I'd hate
to see this as a reason for not doing something.
This is exactly the target audience I'm looking for.  When an author wants
to put a paper up on his FTP or WWW site, I hope they'll also send me the
indexing information so that when people want to find it, they can use
CTRS. I'm not interested in actually storing a copy of the report, although
I'm willing to do so if they cannot make it available any other way.
I have to disagree strongly about the technologically premature part, since
I have had a lot of experience to the contrary during my involvment with
several major technical report systems.  I'm afraid I also have to disagree
with you about the need for this service.  Having attempted to find some of
the reports which I've heard are available on the Net, I'd have to say it's
not a task I'd set an Internet novice too, or one I'd give to someone on a
deadline.  I think a good bibliographic database like I propose in CTRS
would be a definite help.  And at the very very very least, it probably
won't hurt. 8-)
I do.
S'ok with me.  It's not like I'm dead set on doing this or anything.  It's
just an observation, and an offer of service if anyone thinks it'd be
Oh, BTW, another thing I probably should mention that seems obvious to me:
 I'm offering to do this for free.  That is, the database would be a public
service, with no charge to list papers, add another database to the
searching list or to query/retrieve abstracts.

Ack!  Money involved? "Just say no!" 8-)  When I said "contribute" I meant
placing papers in it, or if you've got a lot already, adding your own
database to the list of possible search sites.
I wanna do this as a free service.  There are several reasons (like I can't
see charging people for information that I didn't even produce), but the
real reason for doing it is simple: I wanna use it.
I made a mock up of CTRS, which is available at:
There aren't any crypto papers in it yet, though.  The iTRiBE database (the
only one available for searching right now) is filled with some NASA test
data.  Try doing searches on things like "ratio" or "nasa" for an example
of the output you'd get.
I admit I hadn't thought of these.  I'm not sure I could sign up for the
task of archiving the newsgroups (disk space) but if the authors/copyright
holders of rump papers want to submit them, I'd be happy to index them.  I
don't think the database necessarily has to be composed only of referreed
papers or anything.  I'd be happy to index rump papers, technical reports
or maybe even presentation materials like postscript copies of overhead
Anyway, thanks for the reply!

@_subject: Cryptography Technical Report Server (CTRS) needs submissions! 
Earlier this week I posted a note bemoaning the lack of a good
searchable repository for cryptography related technical reports.
In short, I volunteered to develop, host and maintain such a system
as a service to the rest of the Internet.  The system is ready, now
the fun part begins...
The Cryptographic Technical Report Service needs *YOU*. Specifically,
it needs your technical reports (or other technical documentation).
In order for CTRS to become popular, it needs to have a useful amount
of data to search, so I'm currently soliciting submissions for the
Contributing to CTRS is pretty simple.  Detailed information can be
found at , but
basically all that's required is to send a refer-format bibliographic entry which contains a URL pointing to
the paper's real Net location.  I'll index the entries (prettyprinting
them, of course), and CTRS users will follow that URL if they want to
retrieve the paper.  If you don't have a URL, I'm willing to host as
many papers as I have resources for.  Full details can be found at the
URL above, but please note that I'm only able to accept papers
submitted by the authors (or copyright holder).
If you'd like to know more about CTRS, you can check out it's beta
version at ( for the SSL version).  The database
doesn't have much (anything) in it right now, so I'm relying totally on
submissions in order to build the collection.
I firmly believe that CTRS can provide a useful service to the
cryptographic community, so I hope you will all consider contributing
your reports to CTRS.  If you have questions, please check out the
CTRS FAQ .  If you still have
questions, feel free to contact me at the email address below.

@_subject: SSL Man-in-the-middle 
Has anyone given much thought to the feasability of a man-in-the-middle
attack against an SSL (or other similar) transaction?  To me, the
possibility seems obvious, so I figure it must have been discussed before,
though I haven't seen it.
The basic idea is pretty simple, really a flaw in the user interface of the
browser more than a flaw in SSL.  Neither browsers nor servers routinely
validate that they are communicating with the entity they think they are.
 Sure, with netscape you can ask for the document information window, which
shows the server's public key information, but this isn't a common action
among users, and certainly isn't something you'd want to do for every page
you viewed.
The only readily accessible information about security is that blue key at
the bottom of the netscape window.  Netscape docs tell you that if that key
is blue, your transaction is "secure."  In reality, the only thing that key
means is that you've negotiated a session key and are encrypting your
communications.  It says nothing about the fact that you're actually
communicating with the correct party.  Authentication is a large part of
security, and Netscape doesn't make that information conveniently
Consider the following example.  Bob wants to communicate securely with
Alice.  He fires up his "secure" browser, looks up Alice's address in the
DNS and makes a connection.  He then sends Alice a document and
Now consider the following attack on the scenario:  Bob still wants to
 communicate with Alice.  He fires up his browser and looks up Alice in the
DNS.  Mallet, who wants the information Bob's sending, has subverted
Alice's DNS server and replaced Alice's IP address with his own, making a
note of the proper value.  Thus, when Bob looks up Alice's address in DNS,
he gets the wrong information and contacts Mallet instead.  Mallet performs
the SSL protocol with Bob, pretending to be the server, and then with
Alice, pretending to be the client.
Since neither the browser nor the server perform any authentication checks,
neither Bob nor Alice know they are really speaking to Mallet.  The best
Alice can do is check the IP address of the client she's speaking to, but
if Mallet has his own DNS, he can make the IP address map to whatever name
he wants, including Bob, in order to fool alice.  Even if Alice doesn't
depend on the DNS for IP resolution, probably doesn't know that the IP
address in question is really Mallet's, since it looks just like any other
IP address to her.
In this scenario, Bob gets a warm fuzzy since his key is blue and he knows
his information is being encrypted as it goes out.  Alice has a smaller
fuzzy, since she believes the transaction is secure from prying eyes.
 Mallet has a *really big* fuzzy, since he's able to read the data Bob
sends, decrypt it, save it, then re-send it to Alice.
I've read through the SSL spec, and it provides authentication for both the
server and the client, but these features are rarely used, probably because
they are somewhat inconvenient for the user.  A good first step would be to
include the IP address of the server in the certificate signed by VeriSign.
 In this way, browsers could perform automatic checks that the IP address
in the certificate is actually the one that's being communicated with.
 This does raise other questions (such as protecting from IP spoofing), but
IMHO would be a good way of providing an automatic "first check" without
inconveniencing users.  The added inconvenience of obtaining a new
certificate when your server's IP address changes is fairly minor, and
could be viewed as necessary overhead for doing secure transactions via the

I like this idea, too, except that it presupposes that the journalists who

thing, it's not uniformly available yet.  Still, it's a useful service for
those journalists who do have access to email.  Perhaps both could be done,
with the people on the mailing list also available via conventional means
for the less techno-savvy journalists.

Of course, the above is complete and utter crap (as Simon Spero pointed out
to me in much, much more polite terms 8-).  Let me take a stab at v2.0:
I've read through the SSL spec, and it provides authentication for both the
server and the client, though these features are rarely used, probably
because they are somewhat inconvenient for the user.  A good practice would
be to always code your SSL app to check that the CN (Common Name) field of
the certificate is the same as the hostname listed in the URL (CN always
appears to be an IP address, at least for Netscape server certificates).
Still, even with the bogus last paragraph, I stand by the rest of my post.
 I obviously haven't seen Netscape source, so I don't really know what
checks it might have, but none of the other SSL apps I've seen have an
auto-check feature, though it doesn't seem to be much more trouble at all.
