Just wondering (because maybe you don't live in the US). But why are you
all gonna protest because some Russian got arrested for breaking the law??
Don't you have anything better to do with you're time???
(this isn't a flame but if that's how you want to take it be my guest,
just wondering why we are soo concerned about some russian.. the
principle?? If you want to protest something why not put you're effort
into blowing open the Gary Condit fuck up... )
I mean this ass hole fucked some Intern and then killed her... maybe I'm a
little crazy here (which I have been told oftern that I am) but that seems
a hell of a lot more important then some fucking Commie.
Just my 2 cents (after about 12 beers...)

I know there are things about the U.S govt that you can't or aren't
willing to understand. And if you really have such a small Brain that you
can't see Condit is part of the murder then I really have nothing more to
say to you.. once day you will learn more about the Media their filters,
politics and Money... untill then continue to flame people for your
I won't respond to any more of you're flames.. I know the truth and if you
really belelive that "me" calling into the D.C police or anyone for that
matter is really going to mean anything you might want to reevaluate
your understanding of how the "System" works... it is't as it seems not
even close..
