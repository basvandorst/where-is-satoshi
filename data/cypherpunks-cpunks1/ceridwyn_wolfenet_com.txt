It was interesting how the Agent made the point that the FBI was there to enforce laws, not make policy.  Then his Boss's role in the law making process
was brought up, the Agent said "but any of you can do the same thing, you
all have a voice" etc etc.  Then he refused to answer political questions based on the fact that he was there as a representative of the FBI, failing
to see that his Boss is also a representative of the FBI when recommending
legislation.  (Again, I realize he was "under orders" not to discuss it, I wish he wouldn't try to justify it with obviously faulty logic.)
A more cynical view is that they are there to protect some of the biggest
institutions of "organized crime" (ie: Congress, At&t, Microsoft, etc) who
are ripping people off on a daily basis from the other organizations who
refuse to play by their rules.

@_subject: A Libertine Question 
I was downtown Seattle at night time (early morning), walking around, minding my own business. Probably not actively maintaining public decorum, but
certainly not doing anything unorderly.  A cop approached me and asked what I was doing,
I told him none of his business.  He asked me for my ID, I said why, am I under
arrest?  He said no, but he needs to see my ID.  I told him he has no right to
ask me for my ID, especially when I've been doing nothing wrong, if I wanted to live in those conditions, I'd move to Iraq or China or something.  I got out my handy pocket tape recorder, and asked him to state his name and repeat his
request for the benefit of my lawyer who'd be contacting him. At this point the few
other people on the street had sort of gathered a few yards away, and the cop decided
he wasn't gonna win this one, so asked me to return to my home and left before
I could respond.  You are right, "Clean and dressed up people are rarely IDed [read harassed] on foot."  I'm not concerned for the clean and dressed up
people (with regards to police abuse), I'm concerned about the majority of people who aren't.  (For the record, I'm generally clean, but *rarely* dressed up. =) )  When I flew from Philadelphia about a year ago, they required one picture ID
and one other ID, just like most stores when you want a check cashed.  I still
don't like it, but I have less of a problem presenting ID when I am seeking
a service of some kind.  It is unacceptable to be asked for ID when I am merely
walking around a public street.

I believe the issue with Food Not Bombs is they didn't get the appropriate

you on this point.  I think they shouldn't be required to obtain a license,
but everyone whom they serve food to should know that they don't have such a
license.  This would equal informed consent.  Also, with Food Not Bombs, many
of the people that the food is being served to is also involved in cooking,
distributing food, and cleaning up.  I've been told it's exactly like a big

I'd have to disagree on that point.  Monitoring cellular traffic requires
nothing more than a cellular phone, and some software which enables
you to follow calls through the cells, for a total cost of about $500. This is exceptionally trivial with an Oki 900 and a ctek cable (which interfaces the fone with the computer).  With this software you can monitor individual cells, choosing to "lock
on" to a call made from a specific number, or to a specific number.  You
can follow calls, and record any dtmf digits.  Also the caller will never be made aware that he/she is being listened to.  A sophisticated land line wiretap that will not be detectable by the average citizen will cost well over $500, plus you have to install it without the target knowing, etc.

@_subject: Surf-filter lists 
I am not going to go into petty details about the actual definition of
censor, and how private organizations do censor, but private citizens
have the option of getting their information from an uncensored source,
the same as when a government censors. The only difference is the government is allowed to use physical coercion, whereas on the surface
corporations are not yet allowed to do so.
I will, however, address your argument on a different level.  Your view
of this issue typifies one of the primary objections I have to many of the arguments amongst libertarians.  The problem is NOT JUST GOVERNMENT.
It is with any authority that has power over you. When a private entity becomes powerful enough that they have the ability to forcefully exert
their influence over you, they are just as bad as Government.  Granted,
Surf-Watch and so forth haven't yet become that big, but there are some
rather large Media companies who have, as well as institutions such as
the Church.  For example, I think our mainstream news IS censored, and not necessarily by the government, more by corporations intent on keeping us in the mindframe that will make them the most money and prolong and extend their power.
I am not saying that a private entity doesn't or shouldn't have the Legal
Right to censor, but I am saying that censorship of any form by any
entity is a Bad Thing and the public (not the government, mind) should
fight it on all fronts.  This, in my mind, is the only reason to be
dismayed by the decision on the CDA.  It was found that the government
shouldn't censor on the Internet because there were forms of Corporate
censorship available.  It would have truely been a great day if the
decision had been that the government shouldn't censor on the Internet
because censorship is wrong.
That is another problem, not the Real Problem.  The Real Problem is that
parents are scared to have to explain to children why something they've
seen is wrong or bad.  They are afraid to teach their children their
beliefs and values, so instead would rather just filter everything that conflicts with those beliefs, so that they believe it by default. This is
a big problem when those children grow away from their parent's influence
though, and creates bigotry and intolerance. (They don't know why they
believe what they do, but believe it with fearful vengeance).

I realize you're probably overloaded with email/etc, but as you
don't read c'punks, I'll take a chance with a personal note anyway... Allow the government to think that we think it has the right to give us their permission and we've lost everything.  The government should
need OUR permission, not the other way 'round.  To give the government
the impression that we will bow to it's power on these matters may be
financially beneficial for a corporation, but is unacceptable and humiliating for free individuals.
Because freedom doesn't come in degrees, it's all or nothing.
Exporting crypto-systems and killing people is comparing apples
and hand grenades.  Please come up with a relevant analogy.
While I am one of those who believe your info requests do go too far,
I also appreciate the fact that you wouldn't be able to "do a download"
without it.  I thank you for your efforts on these fronts, and have two things to say regarding:
1)  Please don't chastise individuals who take direct action and use
civil disobediance as a measure to change bad laws and policies (ie by
making your companies software available internationally).  When
done on a mass scale, the long-term benefits FAR outweigh the short
term consequences.  While you as a corporation find it much more difficult to take such actions, as they would most likely ruin your
corporation, individuals acting in this capacity cannot be ruined quite
so readily.
2)  Please don't misuse the information you gain by logging all your
network traffic.  I like using Navigator, and would hate to have to give up using it due to some breach of trust by Netscape regarding someone's personal info. I agree mostly.  I would rephrase, however, to say: In addition to
attacking odd pieces of enforcement, participate in the debate over
the regulations themselves.  Besides, contrary to your gist, this is probably one of the most prominent pieces of enforcement, and therefore a very logical candidate for attack.

@_subject: Filtering out Queers is OK 
Choosing what you read and choosing what other people (including your
children) read is the difference between filtering and censoring. I didn't
say filtering was wrong,  I said censorship was wrong.
I am sorry to hear.  I think we underestimate childrens' ability to decide
for themselves what is right and wrong, and I think the seemingly inate desire for parents to want children that are all but clones of themselves
is especially dangerous and certainly harmful. I think that restricting access
to "negative memes" from anyone (including children) actually does more
harm than good.  I didn't particularly want to get into this, so I will
leave it up to you to read John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty" for very strong
arguements in my support.
I absolutely agree.  Unfortunately, the filtering programs we were discussing
allow a user very little, if any, ability to "set his filters differently".  Again, I agree, and thought I had made that clear.  However, that doesn't mean
we can't object on a social (opposed to governmental) level.  I repeat: just
because a government doesn't have the right to oppose private censorship doesn't
make it OK.
I was under the impression that most on the list were avowed libertarians,
and would rather the State didn't intervene in any part of your (or your
son's) life.  However, I would still argue that restricting your son's
access is more of a detriment to your son than allowing it, then discussing
why it is Wrong (or whatever) and why he feels it is necessary to read such things.  I would also argue that you are right in that the State has no right to force you to raise your child in any way.  But, as I stated in another post, the problem is not just the government.
I fail to see how trying to breed attitudes that you allegedly avow is
"propaganda".  The book you cited is intended as a means of teaching acceptance, not necessarily approval.  You say you tolerate homosexuals,
but that is not a wide-spread practice yet.  Violence and ridicule is the
more common response to openly homosexual behaviour, and that book is meant
to stop such bigoted reactions.  You'll note that nowhere in the book does it say anyone *should* be homosexual, it merely says that it's okay if you are and you should accept others who are.
Please show me an instance where you or your children (if you had any) would
have been forced into practicing homosexuality by anything taught in a public
school or shown on a web page.  Exposure to a lifestyle and having that life-
style's practices forced on you are not the same.  Would you allow your children to learn about Nazi Germany?  I find the lifestyle of the Nazi
positively disgusting, but wouldn't think to prevent my child from learning
about it.  Same thing with other cultures, religions, political principles,
etc.  The simple fact that this particular issue is regarding sexuality bears
no significance to the arguement.  A child (or any other person) should not
be restricted access to any sort of information available about any topic,
unless she is restricting her own access (filtering).

I don't think that demanding more liberty can in any way fall into any
of those three categories.  What happened to protecting a minorities Rights
from the Majority?  Simply because a majority decided they should take away
my Rights (in this case to encryption, and for the sake of argument, I will
concede for the moment that a majority actually did decide this) doesn't mean they should be taken away.  This is what the Constitution and other founding documents are designed to protect us against.  Saying "I have the Right to give encryption to anyone I want" is not forcing my will on the wider population,
it is an attempt to keep the wider population from forcing their un-Constitutional will on me.  //cerridwyn//

============================== START ==============================
Interesting related story about DefCon:  for those of you who have been
to Las Vegas, you know that many casinos have mag stripe cards that are
issued for a variety of reasons, that are just as good as cash in the
casino, but can't be used anywhere else.  Many use them as a sort of debit card for slot machines.  The story goes that a few DefCon attendies acquired a few of these cards from the Tropicana, and re-wrote the stripe to read that they had over 60,000 "points".  I guess they discovered that
the card was re-written each time it was used.  Unfortunately for them,
what they didn't discover was that the system also kept track on a computer somewhere, and the large difference between the computer's tally
and the card's value set off numerous red flags, they found out relatively quickly when two Casino Security guards escorted them to the police station.  Oops.  I can't help but wonder what would've happened if they only made
the difference like 10 points instead of 60K?  These two people were not
too bright, as they were staying at the Tropicana, and probably had all the equipment in their rooms.  If they were of age, I believe (depending
on what they found in the room) they can each get multiple 15 year federal
sentences.  Moral of the Story: Mag Stripe cards are never secure by themselves (the credit card companies mistakenly relied on security by obscurity and are
feeling the painful effects still today), but have the potential to be secure if backed up by that kind of system.  However, it would only really be
practical in a closed environment like a Casino.   Thus, for the sake of all the lovely banks I know and love, I hope they
either A. choose something other than mag. stripes, or B. use them only as
debit cards that are checked against a bank account when used.
