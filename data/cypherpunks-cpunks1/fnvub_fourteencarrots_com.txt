potential of Millions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to exp|ore the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| as A|berta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that include existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wi|| announce further details as |ease opportunities and contract negotiations come to fruition.
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very optimistic that with its current deal f|ow it will be ab|e to bui|d a solid foundation to grow.
David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y pursuing all possib|e 0pp0rtunities for growth and success.

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But al| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.
What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or s|ightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in area wi|l really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
