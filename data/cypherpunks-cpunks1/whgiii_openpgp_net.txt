Well this is the last thing the USPS wants to do (power corrupts and all
that) and they have a few congress critters on their side. A while back they had the postmaster general on C-Span giving his yearly
report to congress. USPS is scared to death of the internet and have been
scrambling around trying to find a way to generate revenue from it. Back
then they were talking about establishing USPS as a national CA and a
center for certified e-mail. I guess they realized that there is no way
they can compete in the marketplace and the only thing to do is to force
their system on everyone.
Now enter the usual suspects and their agenda:
Mandate USPS e-mail addresses for everyone.
Mandate National Electronic ID's (security measure for USPS e-mail).
Mandate use of National CA for ID's (run by USPS).
Mandate GAK for all e-mail on the USPS system.
Mandate all communication to & from government use USPS system.
*Big* tax increase to pay for it all with plenty of pork to go round. Hell
in a few years you will have them whining and crying that computer
ownership is a "right" and we need to *pay* for all those welfare bums to
have one (how else will they get their mail?). At a very minimum every
post office will be set up with public computer terminals so people can
get their mail.
Many of the unusual suspects that will go along with this plan will be
from the states like Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota, ...ect who are fearful
that their constituents will actually have to pay a fair price to have
mail and packages delivered to bum-fuck nowhere. I don't recall the name
but one of the critter from Alaska was very upset that if USPS looses it's
monopoly delivery in Alaska would no longer be subsidized and that they
might have to pay market value to have packages delivered by plane to the
far reaches of the wilderness (god forbid!!).

Also please explain exactly what "violent stuff" you are in reference to

1st off the whole notion of "hostile environment" is bunk. It is a loosely
undefined term to mean anything the PC crowd wants it to. If you do or say
anything that might "offend" a PCer then you have a "hostile workplace".
As I said in previous posts you do not have a right to not be offended not
only that but thanks to the 1st Amendment I have the right to offend you.
One should be very carefull of this whole notion of protecting people from
being offended. Not only does it erode the rights protected under the
Constitution but it can very easily be turned against those who are
promoting it. Political tides are turning and the country as a whole is
getting fed up with the PC crowd. I can see lawsuits in the not to distant
future against the Pcer for creating a "hostile workplace" by pushing

I see, so if a company and it's employees exercise their Constitutionally

No numbers available on Absentee Ballots which in FL are hand counted*.
A recount has been called for.
NOTE: In FL you are given a 2 sided ballot there are broken arrows next to
each candidates name ( <==  == ). In the voting booth you are provided
with a black felt tip pen. To select your candidate you fill in the blank
space to complete the arrow. When you are finished there is an OCR machine
onto of a large box at the entrance to the polling place. You tear off a
stub on the ballot, hand it to the person manning the OCR machine, then
you feed the ballot into the machine which automatically tallies your vote
and deposits the ballot into the box below.
An interesting side note, on presenting my voter registration card I was
asked for my Drivers License. I asked the attendant why she needed it. Her
response was that it was required by law to present a photoID. I asked
here what would happen if I didn't have one. She said that I would not be
able to vote. I did not go into detail if it had to be a state ID or any
photoID would work but I was left with the impression that only a state ID
would be accepted.
There was also some dirty politics here in FL with the various news
networks. For those who are not aware FL has 2 time zones. Everything east
of Tallahasse is Eastern, Tallahasse west is Central. The news media was
very quick to claim FL as a victory for Gore and were broadcasting this
before the polls closed in the western half of the state. One has to
wonder if this did not have an adverse effect on voter turnout in the
panhandle which historically is very conservative (Joe Scarboro (R) ran
unopposed). I voted around 6:30pm and I am quite happy to know that my
vote has had such a profound influence on this election.

@_subject: CDR: More blather from the DEMS on FL 
While the recount of the FL ballots is going on the Democrats are now
complaining about the format of the ballot and threating legal action. It
seems that the ballot is "confusing". The complaint is that the double
sided ballot contained 2 columns on each side rather than one.
I personally used the FL ballot. It was large, well printed, and quite
legible. Anyone who was "confused" by it's format is just too dam stupid
to vote.
I am starting to get the feeling that the SC is going to decide this
election before it is all over. :(

@_subject: CDR: [Correction] More blather from the DEMS on FL 
My mistake, seems that one county in FL used a different ballot than the
rest of the state. They used a punch style ballot with one column of punch
holes and candidates on both sides:
Bush  --> 0            0 <-- Buchanan
Gore  --> 0
          0 <-- Nader
          0
          0
Still seems simple enough to me.
IMHO if the courts order a new election in this county then they need to
do it for the entire state as the electorial college is winner take all
and it would be unjust to allow this one county to determine how these
delegates vote.

@_subject: CDR: Reports of Democrat Fraud on Absentee Ballots. 
Listening to Luke McCoy on AM 1370 in Pensacola tonight there are reports
comming in of absentee ballots that have been intercepted and fraudulently
One report from a Escambia Co. resident in Dade Co. had requested an
absentee ballot. This ballot was never received and a second one was
requested. The election board confirmed that the 1st ballot had not been
processed and a second one was sent out. The second one was never
received. On further investigation the 1st ballot was received after the
2nd was sent out. The signature did not match that of the voter
registration form, and needless to say that the forged ballot was filled
out for Gore.
Another report of a woman who had an absentee ballot returned in her name
from Canada, she claims that she has never been to Canada. Again a Gore
For right now this is all just 4th party hearsay. I'll call the election
board in the morning and see if I can get some confirmation.
Things may get ugly down here before it's all over...

I am not sure that they would as this seems to go against the 22nd
Amendment. While the 22nd doesn't specifically address an appointed acting
president I doubt that the new congress would be inclined to keep Clinton
around nor would they want to create more problems while trying to
straighten out the current mess.
Amendment XXII
(1951) Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more
than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted
as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person
was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more
than once. But this article shall not apply to any person holding the
office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress, and
shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President,
or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes
operative from holding the office of President or acting as President
during the remainder of such term.

I am rather torn on the issue. On the one hand leaving Clinton in would
lend an appearance of stability "we are not changing anything until we get
this mess sorted out" while on the other hand I feel that it would
interfere with the principle that "the office is stronger than any one
man". We have dealt with war & assassinations and still have been able to
change Presidents without problems. As things look right now I don't see
the US facing any immediate crises that would mandate keeping Clinton in
office (something major like nukes going off, full scale domestic revolt,
...ect) so I am leaning to congress appointing someone other than him to
act as acting  President until the mess is straightened out. Wether that
person is a Democrat or a Republican doesn't seem that important as he
really wouldn't be doing anything unless we wind up at war with someone. If this election does wind up being decided in Congress it will be the
biggest game of chicken since the Cuban Missle Crises. Should be
interesting to see who blinks first.

Actually it is rather common practice for various jails/prisons to take
blood samples from everyone who stays long enough to be "processed" (by
processed I mean someone who is staying more than a couple of hours
waiting for bail). This is done for health reasons (aids, hepatitis, name
your disease here, testing), because of this the samples are taken from
everyone regardless of the crime accused of or convicted.  I do not know what the policy is with the storing and recording of DNA
data but the specimens are being collected.

This seems to be a rather anal approach to filtering out potential virus. Considering that Qualcomm is a member of the IMC (Internet Mail Consortium) it would be funny if not so sad.
