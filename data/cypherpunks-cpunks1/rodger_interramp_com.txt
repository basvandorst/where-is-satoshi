There was a cover story peep about the idea in Interactive Week June 24, in
fact. The story followed Bidzos' announcement that NTT would soon be
producing 3-DES chips en masse.
It's at: Bidzos' pending deal brought forth several questions:
1 - Could others try something like the DES deal with stuff under copyright
and still make money doing it?
2 - If so, was the administration aware of it? and;
3 - Who, if anyone, would be the first to try it?
The answers were:
1 - Yes, someone else could try it.
2- The administration wouldn't comment, but had an official reply that
showed it grasped all the implications within 15 minutes of our asking.
3 - No one's stepping forward, but Ken Bass, atty. for Phil Karn and Phil
Zimmermann, among others, said he knew some folks were considering moves
along those lines, though he gave few details.
Steptoe & Johnson cyberspace atty. Stewart Baker suggested such a move would
be "extremely aggressive advice," though "not quite insane." if I remember
A few caveats to any US citizen who finds himself  trying to help such a
situation occur:
1) The loophole can be closed by executive order with little or no notice, and
2) Any citizen aiding the export of such software will of course, be brought
up on some pretty serious felony charges if caught. Foreign nationals are
doubtless subject to the same laws if on US soil while the deed gets done.
Then again, Baker said, "if one gets away with it, dozens will try it, too."
I won't be the first to try.

Yup. He was speaking only of the US company. As you mentioned, odds of anyone getting caught are fairly low in many cases, but even lower for anyone
outside the US.
 The odds the US would go after a foreign company would seem pretty remote,
 based in a country that strongly suppported US policy. The UK comes to

@_subject: Shell buys key escrow system from Trusted Info. Systems 
Administration officials didn't return calls for comment, but it's clear
that the Clinton-Gore team have their first "testbed" for trying out key
recovery, or key escrow, proposals.
Steven Walker, president of Glenwood, Md.'s Trusted Information Systems
Inc., told Inter at ctive Week late last week that TIS will supply his
company�s Gauntlet Firewall technology, complete with commercial key escrow
capabilities, to an a large multinational with headquarters outside the
United States. The multinational company will self-escrow, that is handle
all encryption keys itself, in cooperation with the British government,
sources close to the deal said. Walker declined to name the company, but several Washington-based sources
confirmed the buyer is Royal Dutch Shell.
The deal represent the first time that a foreign buyer has purchased a US
key escrow product  without escrowing keys in the US. Indeed, TIS has sold
only one other system for export abroad, one which involved communications
between the US and the UK with US key escrow.
Walker, widely credited with devising the controversial commerical key
escrow system now being promoted by the current administration, claimed
"there really is an important issue here in finding a balance between the
interest of government and those of industry. A policy that says anyone who
wants to export strong encryption as long as there is key recovery is an
important development."
The success of the deal and others like it could figure heavily in the
Clinton administration's ability to sell it its latest proposals on
commercial key escrow; a recent report from the National Research Council
recently warned that such efforts were unproven and required serious
examiniation before they could be deployed. Long-time critics of the
proposal have, in turn, leveled the same criticisms.
Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security Inc. and a long-time foe of
administration policy said he doubted the market would rush to purchase
products like Trusted Information Systems,� but said he was slightly more
hopeful for a resolution to the controversy than he had been previously.
"I�ve said all along that user key escrow is the only thing that makes
sense," Bidzos said. Users who hold their own keys "can comply with any
regulation in the world - if you want to give your keys to France or whoever
you can � that�s your business. If it's good enough for the CIO, it's good
enough for the CIA."
Royal Dutch Shell officials said security considerations forbade confirming
a sale had been made, but freely admitted to having had talks with TIS. The
company�s interest key escrow, computer security head Nick Mansfield said,
lay principally in getting access to records after keys had been lost,
stolen or otherwise disabled.
The Gauntlet firewall, nonetheless, encrypts and decrypts messages as they
arrive; it does not store messages in encrypted form.
"To us it�s not a matter of �going along� with key escrow, it�s a matter of
doing business," Mansfield said.

From a draft to be posted shortly at By Will Rodger
Wahington Bureau Chief
Inte at active Week
The Department of Justice will appeal to the Supreme Court a federal court
decision that stayed enforcement of a controversial Internet indecency law,
sources close to the court challenge told Inter at ctive Week Thursday.
Department of Justice lawyers gave Sen. J. James Exon, D-Nebr. news of the
appeal in a three-line letter delivered to the law's chief sponsor
Wednesday. A copy of the letter was obtained by Inter at ctive Week.
Exon welcomed the news. "We needed the Justice Department to make a final
decision on the appeal, which I am pleased that they have done with the
full support of the White House," Exon said. "This will now go to the
Supreme court and I believe we will get a more thoughtful decision out of
the top court than what the court in Philadelphia ruled."
Attorneys on the other side seemed equally pleased.
"This is wonderful news because it means the Supreme Court will have a
chance to speak on these issues," said Mike Godwin, staff counsel of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. "We feel certain the Supreme Court will
uphold the lower court's finding that the statute is unconstitutional."
The Communications Decency Act, passed as part of telecommunications reform
legislation last February, would have banned indecent images and speech
from any areas open to minors on the Internet. Under the law, operators of
Internet sites would have been required to segregate indecent content into
adults-only areas that required a credit card or other form of positive
identification for access.
Drafters based their restrictions in large part on regulations governing
broadcast media which still prohibit indecency over the airwaves, as well
as some local ordinances which require segregation of indecent materials
from others.
But a coalition of civil liberties groups, for-profit and non-profit
organizations challenged the Act in a consolidated suit before a federal
court in Philadelphia. The law, plaintiffs claimed, was unconstitutional
since it set up restrictions on indecent but constitutionally protected
The CDA, moreover, would place a "chilling effect" on free speech as
Internet users unnecessarily limited their speech in order to comply with
an impermissibly vague law, plaintiffs claimed. In place of the CDA,
plaintiffs suggested evolving technologies in the hands of responsible
parents would better protect children while preserving adults' First
Amendment rights.
The Philadelphia Court agreed with the plaintiffs on all counts, striking
down the law June 12. In a unanimous decision, a three-judge panel found
that the democratic nature of  the Internet entitled it to at least as much
protection as print, traditionally the least regulated of all media. The
court also found that the statue was impermissibly vague and would thus
unnecessarily restrict speech. The court also ruled the government had
failed to show the law was enforceable with current technology.

@_subject: Interactive Week exclusive - White House to launch "Clipper III" 
The White House is about to answer recent attempts to liberalize encryption
exports with a proposal of its own.
Documents obtained by Interactive Week show the Ciinton Administration has
been lobbying key Republican committee members to compromise on encryption
through a policy that looks very much like previous commerical key escrow
This time, however, the administration has proposed a new, licensed network
of certification authorities and escrow agents to control access to strong
encryption abroad.
The newest proposal is contained in a 24-page White Paper, a draft of which
hit Capitol Hill earlier this week.
Much of the administration's "key management infrastructure" assumes a
similar network of certification authorities abroad. CAs would link public
keys to their owners, and could serve as escrow agents for users' private
keys, as well. The two would not have to be under the same roof, however.
An overarching "Policy Approving Authority" would supervise all subordinate
CAs and escrow agents.
Since US escrow of exported products pose well-known problems for privacy
and business concerns, the US is proposing foreign governments get into the
act as well. If other governments acted as escrow agents, the Clinton White
House argues, interlocking agreements among governments would protect all
their common security concerns while giving non-US citiczens access to US
encryption products.
The ultimate goal, the White House says, is to allow export of anything at
all, so long as keys are escrowed with an agent of its approval.
The White House is evidenty relying on OECD initiatives for much of this to
Specifically, the "Clipper III" paper says that:
                U.S. companies can export software programs that use keys
that are 64 bits
                of data long, if they agree to escrow keys that unlock the
encryption in the
                U.S. or with an appropriate agency abroad.
                 Manufacturers can export hardware that use 80-bit keys to
encrypt data, if
                keys are escrowed.
                 Large U.S. companies can escrow keys and not rely on third
Reaction is as before. Civil libertarians are already denouncing the White
Paper, while pro-escrow forces are praising it. Staffers to Commerce and
Judiciary committee call it the same old proposal, but with a large
bureaucracy behind it.

No indications they would. Idea is each authority could talk to the other

Declan raises a good point. But I'm guessing it's a bit more complex than
that.  CyberPromo and AOL lawyers tell me the court slapped down AOL simply
to "keep the status quo." Both sides used those very words, in fact. What's more, CyberPromo talks a good game on the First Amendment, but used
computer fraud and unfair competition statutes - not the Bill of Rights - in
its original filing against AOL. So what's going on?
It seems Weiner is  _very_ aware that this case deals with things never
before argued in court. No one has really sorted out just how much e-mail -
if any - an ISP is obligated to carry against its wishes. What Weiner
decides this fall may not set the kind of precendent that the case of the
Pentagon Papers did, but will be important for a while at least.

Cyber Promotions of course is not now a client of AOL, which is one the company's defenses against AOL. Although AOL attorneys don't make the connection outright, their filings seem to imply that once one is an AOL customer, he's always subject to their rules. Wallace, it seems, had an account or two with AOL and was spamming during that time in violation of terms of service. They soon bumped him from the service.
Now that he's not a subscriber, they claim Wallace is still violating terms of service. How that's relevant to a former subscriber is far from clear. Wallace's attorneys, of course say it isn't relevant at all.
No doubt about it; this one is going to be a lot of fun.

Ah, but they never do.
Why not? Because spammers _invariably_  forge the return addresses to keep
exactly that from happening. Indeed, Cyber Promo claims it "had an
understanding" with AOL that it could use AOL boxes  or bogus adresses to
keep bounced messages from coming back at them and crashing their server.
Deliberatlely forging addresses, Cyber claims, is entirely legal. AOL says
it's fraud.
Interesting footnote: AOL, of course, is able to trace a lot of the spam it
gets. It has sent back thousands of messages at once to Cyber which, in
turn, has gotten it bumped from several ISPs once their servers crashed as a
