Thanks for the great message. I hope I don't start (too much of) a
flame war about these religious issues...
   ...
   I did give a 25-minute talk on "Implications of Cryptography," which
   generated some good discussion. I also cemented some thoughts in
   discussion with Bernard Peuto and Ted Kaehler about the need for a
   deeper analysis of the old computer science work on "mutually
   suspicious cooperating agents," which was predicted to be a Big Thing
   for computer science (along with objects, segmented logical address
   spaces, and several other such Good Ideas), but which faded out when C
   and flat, Unix-style address spaces came to the fore.
You might want to check out research about "the Byzantine Generals
problem", e.g. in ACM's TOPLAS, including (I believe) stuff about
synchronizing distributed mutually-suspicious clocks. As I understand
it, many these problems have been generally solved in theory, and are
just waiting for demand and resources to be put in practice. There is
room for more work, of course.
Objects are Great; C++ (using objects, in I believe the way you mean)
is clearly the language of choice for the virtually the entire
(commercial) programming industry. At least this is for software; if
you are talking about hardware support (e.g. segmented address spaces,
such as the i432) this was always dubious, because in general it is
always better (when possible and adequately efficient) to do something
at "compile time" than "run time" (for example, proving that resources
are protected, by ensuring that given protocols are followed).
So I think Objects are a Good Idea, but I think Segmented Logical Address
Spaces are in principal Less Good (within reason) than a Single Large
Address Space (equivalent in size, within reason) with compile-time
"proofs" of non-interference.
Of course, multiple process address spaces also absorb the functionality
provided by Segmented Logical Address Spaces, and so the Client-Server
model now being hyped immoderately is sort of an implementation of the
Same Thing.
   ...
   Food for thought. I'm wondering if a project to implement a kind of
   "Digital Money World," perhaps in SmalltalkAgents, wouldn't be an
   interesting project. (Many will probably tell me that a collection of
   Perl scripts would be more "portable" and more useful to the current
   Unixcentric community....something I'd like to see more discussion
   of.)
I suspect the framework of choice would be some sort of MOO or MUD. Of
course, once it hit production status, then transliteration into Perl
install scripts would be appropriate.
   Exciting times.
You bet -- it sure is interesting to be alive in these "latter days".
As his ex-Prince-ness has said: "We're gonna party like it's 1999".
Of course, we'd better get strong crypto distributed before the Second
Coming -- you think the current US government is involved in a power
grab, you just wait!!! This new government will really know how to
take care of non-conformists -- Waco is nothing compared to what they
are planning (read: fiery brimstone)...
I wonder if Jesus can create a number so large he can't factor it?

Pardon my excursion into various religious topics -- arguably this
list is also about religion ("religion is what you do" -- "cypherpunks
write code" -- belief that strong crypto should be widely distributed
is certainly a religious tenet for some on this list). I hope I

Pardon me for getting on a soapbox (again)
T. C. May, for whom I have the utmost respect (and whose messages
are always enlighting and enjoyable), says (in part):
                                                 And "Byzantine
   Agreement" (is this the same thing as Byzantine Generals?) shows up, I
   recall, in some crypto papers.
Yes, they are the same. You have N mutually suspicious individuals
trying to reach concensus about something -- what protocol do you use?
I believe the seminal paper (or at least some really good, polished,
early work) was by Leslie Lamport at Xerox Parc (et al.), but I may be
   > Objects are Great; C++ (using objects, in I believe the way you mean)
   > is clearly the language of choice for the virtually the entire
   Yes, of course this is what I meant. That's why I mentioned the
   Smalltalk approach. (I won't get into issues of performance of C++
   over Smalltalk and Lisp systems...my contention is that there's a vast
   amount of computer power out there and a (relative) shortage of good
   programmers and their time, and that this implies that only truly
   time-critical things or many-times-replicated programs warrant writing
   in lower--level languages. A religious point, no doubt.)
Also a practical (== economic) point. When I worked at Mentor Graphics
(MGC), I was amazed at the enormous percentage of effort devoted to
optimization of our products (MGC builds the software to help design
circuits that go in workstations that run MGC software that helps
design circuits...). The _entire company_ (many hundreds of engineers)
just about spent _years_ making a recent release small enough and fast
enough to be commercially viable (luckily for me and them they
succeeded -- of course, there were bug fixes and some enhancements
added during the same time period).
At MGC and now at EBT, efficiency (= responsiveness, = salability) of the
delivered product is a virtually paramount goal, right up there with enough
functionality. If functionality cannot be delivered with adequate efficiency,
then nobody will buy it (except a few leading edge weirdos), and you go broke
(MGC lost big bucks during this time period, and experienced at two or three
waves of layoffs).
If anybody can afford large, expensive workstations to improve the
productivity of their superacheivers, it is computer manufacturers and
their circuit designers (one of the highest paid engineering fields I
know of). Their whole company depends (you may have guessed what I'm
about to say) on the efficiency (production efficiency and efficiency
in their target application) of the chips they are producing, for which
MGC tools were (at least the primary) design vehicle.
And yet it was cost effective to have me and many other engineers
(also comparatively highly paid, but not compared to circuit designers
I'm sure) spend several years trying to reduce the size of the object
code (and working data structure size) for the tools.
Earlier, when MGC was in the desktop publishing business for awhile
(which is where I was most of the time), efficiency was a major,
major concern. Keeping the size of data structures and code to a
minimum was well worth the effort it took to design more complex
systems. Every customer seemed to really care how fast our product
ran, which essentially translated into how much physical memory it
took to run the product. One of the major competitive advantages of
our (now discontinued) product was that it handled extremely large
documents relatively efficiently. But customers were always asking
to make certain operations more efficient, and this was often on
their top N list of enhancements.
So, even using a "lower level language" like C++, even for a high
end programming shop like MGC, even for not-many-times-replicated
programs (I don't know how many seats MGC has installed, but it is
somewhere in the tens of thousands), memory space was at a premium.
I still _can not believe_ that after all the progress semiconductor
manufacturers have made in the past 30 years that they cannot
manufacture enough RAM cheaply enough to hold our software. This
is truly INCREDIBLE! RAMs are still (at least as of a year or two
ago) sufficiently expensive that a significant fraction (maybe 1/3)
of programming effort must be wasted merely trying to keep memory
utilization as small as possible.
Ask how much time DBMS vendors spend on optimizations; it is huge!
(Arguably, it is their entire business.) Compiler writers -- same
thing (I did this in a previous job too). GUIs have to be speedy
too, and people I know spend a lot of time adding performance
hacks to speed them up. For real tools used in real applications,
apparently customer expectations have increased _significantly
faster_ than our ability to manufacture semicondutor components.
People have always said that "sufficient" computing capacity (or
network capacity, or what have you) will be Here Real Soon Now(tm),
but it hasn't happened yet, and I'm not sure it ever will in the real
critical applications where the rubber meets the road (and computer
circuit design is one of them -- data retrieval, publishing, and
networking are also).
Of course, this is all relative, and Internet clearly has the
bandwidth to support the CP list. My point is that in the real
world, efficiency (however measured) is still a major concern
for economic survival.
I predict that efficiency of cryptography will be important,
and it will be a long while before enough computer power is
widely available to encrypt all data, sensitive or not (i.e.
cryptography is cheap enough to not worry about whether to
use it or not).

   I would agree, except the history of "develop it in an
   ultra-high-level language/environment and then port it later" has not
   been too encouraging: for whatever and various reasons, the ports
   rarely take place.
Right. Remember, Fred Brooks (in his classic on software engineering
_The Mythical Man Month_) says to plan to throw one away. So you build
the first one, and instead of porting it you redesign it from scratch.

   You'll find many on this list who agree with every point here.
I hope my implied smiley was apparent here, and the McElwaine-like addendum
(deleted by Tim) was hopefully enough to convey my true attitude...
   > I wonder if Jesus can create a number so large he can't factor it?
   >    I haven't found one yet.
What haven't you found -- a number you can't factor? Or a number
that Jesus can't factor? (I bet at this moment there are a lot of
them, for example "12".) Or a number that your deity (if any) can't
factor? Or is this an implied-smiley-bearing reference to a potential
delusion of grandeur on your part? Or are you and he really working
on this problem collaboratively, in some metaphysical domain?
If you are saying that you can't find a "Jesus" who can create a
number so large he can't factor it, I would tend to strongly agree
with you. On the other hand, virtually every person who ever lived
can (with a little coaching, perhaps) create a number they can't
factor, and there are plenty of living people named Jesus.
Maybe it is just because you aren't looking in the right places... :-)

Projecting current progress in factoring, how long will 1024-bit keys
be secure against something like NSA?
Is it the case that by standarizing on 1024-bit keys for the
forseeable future, are we merely providing a window of opportunity for
cryptopunks which will work fine for awhile but which will slam shut
forever once the NSA becomes able (as a result of vast computer power,
if nothing else) to routinely factor numbers this large, maybe in
about 2150 or so? Remember people thought RSA-129 would take a long
Cypherpunks write code that will remain secure for a long, long time I
hope. Standardizing on RSAREF might, in the very long run, eventually
have the same crippling effect that standarizing on clipper could have
in the short to intermediate term. If people become complacent about
this limitation, it could become institutionalized. If everybody
uses PGP 2.5 for the next hundred years, what happens then?
If the public PGP depends on RSAREF whose evolution is controlled by
RSA, and if eventually a new version comes out which is incompatible
with the older versions, and for which source code isn't as readily
available, and the world standardizes on it, and it isn't interoperable
with older versions, then we lose control, even if we now distribute
a version of PGP 2.5 with the key restriction removed.
I would be happier if PGP 2.5 did not impose such a limit on key
length. If we standardize on something with limitations, we have
to remove them in the future. If we standarize on something without
limitations, future generations don't have to worry about it.
In addition to distributing crypto to the masses, we need to ensure
that no infrastructure gets imposed which obviates our methods. I
don't know if the 1024-bit key restriction will over time become
an important limitation or not -- do you? A better question -- how
long will it take?
I don't think I'm being paranoid, I'm just curious about the details
about what is known about just how hard factoring is, and how that
corresponds to the exponential growth in technological capability, and
where the crossover point lies for 1024-bit keys. Maybe I should just
read the book instead of posting... (Naah!..)

I signed it. I have in the past received from Michael Ward a copy of a
paper describing congestion-based pricing models, which seem to work
really well for the kinds of things that everybody wants.
This letter seems to take such models into consideration, and seems to
be more cautionary than reactionary. Obviously, a metered model (like
phones) would be inappropriate for Internet, but is probably what
phone/cable companies would like to charge, even though it would
stifle usage.
This letter, while reacting against all usage models, seems to me
to leave the door open to more intelligent pricing models, such
as the congestion model (e-mail me for details). Thus, it seems
to address my concerns, and my fright at the idea of a conventional
usage-based model was sufficient to get me to agree to sign the
letter, in spite of the fact it doesn't call out congestion-based
models explicitly as an alternative. I specifically agree with all
the recommendations.
The congestion-based pricing model is essentially this (if I remember
it correctly): every packet includes how much it would be willing to
pay to be sent within a given time frame. The switch sends the packets
with the highest bids, but charging them each the amount of the
cheapest sent packet. Other packets either wait or get NACK'ed (I
forget what happens here). Note that zero is a fine amount to bid --
it just means you wait until the line frees up. Packets have an
incentive to actually bid the correct amount they would be willing to
pay, but don't get charged if they bid too high. People who care about
throughput pay enough to add enough capacity so there is always some
slack time. It really seems to me to work like a charm. I've got a

What's the story with PGP 2.6? I haven't (yet) gotten any hard
information about it -- is there mail I should have gotten but didn't?
I'm sure glad MIT put out 2.5, before putting out 2.6. It
would have been much worse if they went right to 2.6. It
does seem fortuitous that 2.5 ever got released at all, or
am I missing something?
This whole process backs up the point that the whole cryptography
infrastructure is important. Maybe the world will split into 2.6+
and 2.5- camps, with the 2.6+ camps being locked onto a bandwagon
they can't get off of. Maybe all software in the future will have
2.6+ built into it, making life really unmanagable for the dwindling
2.5- crowd[sic]. How can you get cryptography to the masses when
they all have Clipper? You can't -- if it gets that bad, we've
lost the battle (although we can keep our own antique 2.5- copy
if we want to, as a relic from the "good old days").
I'd bet that 2.6 doesn't have a backdoor in it, but that 2.7 or
2.8 or 3.9 or 123.456 eventually will...
And, as I pointed out before, if the world gets saddled with a key
length restriction in whatever evolves to become the standard,
eventually that will be equivalent to a back door.
Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but how can we fight the infrastructure
battle? I'm sore afraid that our brand of crypto is like trying to
peddle a new OS to compete with Unix/NT/... -- it just ain't real
easy to displace a "standard", flawed though it may be...

lamination-Employee ID kits from Office Depot, taking the polaroid on a blue
background, trimming the photo, and assembling the employment ID.  I'm one
of my best employees.
Don't forget to include your EMP_NO.  It gives the clerk something to write
"Governments are simply not fully sovereign in the world of information;
their powers within it are strangely limited....This weakness of government
control within computer nets--a product of strongly protected privacy, a
lack of frontiers and confusions of jurisdiction--make them natural places
for subversion." -- The Economist "Softwar--A Survey of Defence Technology"

   I have yet to see a date, but Digicash states several times in their
   press releases that Cyberbucks are only a trial currency, and that at
   some point in the future the trial will come to an end.
   Will the bottom drop out of the c$ market at that point?
Will there be a collectors market for c$? Does Chaumian cash work
as collectable antiques? What is the difference in value of a "real"
signed Mickey Mantle baseball card vs. one mechanically imprinted?
Will "original" digical cash have the cachet normally associated with
obsolescent objects consisting primarily of protons and neutrons? How
much will the "provenance" of my e-cash be worth? I am assuming that
the provenance of e-cash will be the same credentials which made it
unforgable in the first place; presumably a (hobbyist?) organization
will maintain the books determining authenticity, with an obvious
self-interest to keep it afloat.
So what happens if a collectors market for antique e-cash springs up? Or
is this even conceptually possible? Or is is possible only if enough
people to make a market believe it is possible? Will Digicash open their
books or transfer them to the Smithsonian (or the computer museum) or
something? Is there a market value for the obsolete c$ database? I
wouldn't think so, but...

   >Consistent with the trend towards treating employees like children,
   I'm not surprised someone sees a market for this.  I've worked at
   a number of customer sites that block access to 900 numbers and
   local pay-per-call numbers, which also blocks access to Time-of-day
   and some vendors' customer-support numbers.
Also 911 apparently, I've heard...

It's your service provider....same thing happened to a whole bunch of
us when we used to be on it...and only selective posts to selective lists.
Look to the headline's your provider has generated the past few days and
you'll get a clue as to what's going on...except the net spread by them and
the feds is a lot wider than just kiddie pornographers.
BTW, I'm being cagey in actually mentioning your service provider's name/
initials, as we found that was one of the "keywords" in the filter program
used by them and a certain national police agency (who's initials also trigger the filter program) to flag posts which they thought may be "interesting", resulting in delays of up to days in posting.  Same thing
happened in live chat in PRIVATE chat rooms, we were able to bring the
system to a complete halt by just typing the initials of Frederico's
Bumbling Idiots....
The only solution to Amerigo's Obnoxious Lackeys was to cancel our accounts and switch to CHEAPER local service providers, who also happen
to provide BETTER service, with no censorship/surveillance.
