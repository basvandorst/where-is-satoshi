@_subject: CDR: NERDS paper published 
For those interested, CORE SDI has published the paper on NERDS
(Non-Euclidean Ring Data Scrambler) a new public-key cryptosystem
that was presented by two of the authors (Emiliano Kargieman and
Ariel Waissbein) at the Crypto 2000 Rump Sessions
It can be downloaded in PDF format from:
 The Abstract follows:
  "In this paper we introduce the Non-Euclidean Ring Data Scrambler
    public-key cryptosystem, NERDS. This cryptosystem consists of
    efficient liner algebra procedures and its security relies on
    different problems in Algebraic Number Theory over orders of
    number fields, such as the non-existence of division algorithms
    (nor efficient factorization algorithms) over non-euclidean domains"
"Understanding. A cerebral secretion that enables one having it to know
 a house from a horse by the roof on the house,
 Its nature and laws have been exhaustively expounded by Locke,
 who rode a house, and Kant, who lived in a horse." - Ambrose Bierce
