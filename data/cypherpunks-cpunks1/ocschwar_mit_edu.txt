Did Curley's lawyers at least have the smarts to grab a snapshot
of the site before getting it taken down?

You definitely should. A quick email from anybody on this list and your printouts
will be subpoenaed. (By which side, I know not.)
Maybe you're an alien from space.

Actually, she got shot at and roughed up
by AN members. (AN has a habit of disavowing relations
with members once they get in trouble with The Elders of Zion.)

Coeur D'Alene has a lot of tourism going on,
and you must not get out much.
I hear a backfire at least once a week in Boston.
If anything, after the incident the AN's neighbors might have decided to milk it for what it's worth.
AN has been depressing the tourism in the area and
many of the locals want their heads on stakes. A friend of mine's
cousin was there at the last march and some of the neighbors
were there hoping to get a few punches in Aryan noses
and then blame the ruckus on the JDL. The AN
has a charming rep around there.
Oh, hell yes.
Sharpton and Jackson should both pay for
the damage and injuries they've incited in NYC.

If it was 'officially set forth'
one would think you could produce quotes rather than paraphrases.
And maybe name the correct organization.
(NCGO doesn't seem to exist, if Altavista is anything to go by)

All of the gay organizations were disowned by the Elders
after an ILGO official criticized the Elder Chairman's choice
of cilantro over parsley in the chicken salad at the last
conference. She's a bit touchy about such things.

Very good.
Now, let's have cites.
The proper format is
Author, title, date, page numbers, publishing house.
ISBN numbers would be nice, too.

One of the pictures has a little boy wearing a t-shirt referring to the 1998 FIFA world cup.
Haven't seen the picture (indymedia.il is having MySQL trouble); can't try to confirm yet.
