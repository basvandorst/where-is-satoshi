It is far better that the silent become speakers rather than grunters.
Grunters, and sig spoofers, add nothing to the cause they steadfastly refuse to participate in or join. It would be better for them to remain
silent than erode the language of the speakers.
Your proposal doesn't reward speaking. It merely allows grunting.
Most parents know from first hand experience that very
young children learn how to make complete sentences when their parents
no longer accept pointing and grunting as acceptable behavior.
Excuse me. Let's say that the smarter ones also learn how to add

at the top. Not a Herculean effort for most, and still a lot easier than
even retrieving PGP from the MIT site, to say nothing of learning how
to use it at the most basic level.
If it diverts the course of progress away from the desired objective,
it deserves to be abandoned.
If my goal is increasing my endurance to be able to swim across the
lake, I'm not willing to say that making it half way across before
developing cramps and drowning is any manner of "partial progress".
My whole point is that the cause is noble and worthwhile, but this method
of achieving it is flawed, ineffective, and will do more harm than good
to the widespread of crypto. If you decide to require digital signatures, it would be far better to require real sigs than bogus sigs. I would urge
you to set your sights higher than the goal you've defined so as to allow
for the inevitable circumvention that accompanies any new set of requirements.
There are plenty of examples of "lowest common denominators" in society
today, and I think most people deserve (and prefer) something more than that.

I've been following the dig sig fracas with great interest. While
I can see merit in both sides, the pro-sig argument is weakened
by their endorsement of sig spoofing. If the object is to heighten
awareness of crypto and digital signatures, what possible Good
can follow from setting the example that "cypherpunks simulate
The way I see it, either sign or don't sign, but attaching a
bogus signature block to a message for the sole purpose of pacifying
a mailing list requirement diminishes the significance of crypto
and sullies the image of all who participate. If sigs are required, then valid sigs should be required. Make a
new key pair that's used solely for the purpose of signing your
list mailings. Any resulting damage to reputations or egos signed
by a pilfered low security key would be no more significant than
a forged message left unsigned.
By the same token, I don't see how this proposal does much to spread
the Good Word. Maybe the sole intent is for the participants to share
in the warm, fuzzy feelings of "doing their part". Like flying a kite
for peace or dumping red paint on an already-dead furry animal carcass,
the primary goal of promoting the proper use of crypto seems less
important here than the _perception_ of promoting it. Not everything
that feels good is good for you.

@_subject: Remailer anonymity 
Much has been said lately about maintaining anonymity for remailer
users while providing some "pay to play" mechanism for the operator.
Absent strong collusion between operators, doesn't remailer chaining
ensure anonymity? Plenty of movie "bad guys" escape by getting on the
subway because no one knows where they'll get off or change lines.
It seems to me that knowing a person entered the system is far less
information than knowing where they exited. As long as remailers have
guaranteed access to other remailers, anonymity should be maintained. Re: collusion; I'd sooner believe the Macro$oft/RCC fable.
In a gadda da vida, Billy.

Way too complicated . . .
Why not establish a system where the only the first remailer is paid and
all subsequent remailers agree to accept traffic from other remailers
without compensation? Assuming that first remailer use is or would be
somewhat distributed, the net from each remailer would approach the same
figure reached by endlessly confusing cross-payments (A pays B, C, and D,
B pays A, C, and D, etc.). Only non-remailed access would be subject to
a fee.
Operators with the best net. reputations and those whose remailers are especially full featured or prompt will likely receive more use as
"entry" remailers; this is good capitalism which should not only increase
their number but improve the state of remailers in general. If someone
wants to establish a remailer that will join the existing mesh of remailers,
it will have to accept messages from others gratis if it wants such access
to the rest of them. Its compensation would be derived from initial traffic.
Maybe this would also encourage operators to beat the bushes for traffic,
which would also be a Good Thing.

Jonathan replied:
Unfortunately, this creates the closest association between specific
traffic and paying customers.
What's to prevent mail from remailer A sent to remailer B from being
sent right back to A for delivery? That's a part of the mixing required
for true randomness. I don't know if this is being done now (by Chain or
premail), and I'd like to know why. There might well be a good reason I'm
not aware of. In order to join the mesh, remailers would be required
to accept and ultimately deliver mail to ensure equality among them.
I believe that a class of "prime" remailers would arise; these would be
the preferred remailers, and their input and output would largely be
balanced. This assumes, of course, that "second-class" remailers (those
which profit equally but don't deliver as the last unit in the chain)
aren't allowed in on a equal basis. Prime operators deserve, and would
receive, compensation.
See above. What's the difference between A-->B-->C-->B and A-->B-->C-->D ?
If someone is logging messages and routing, it's less secure, but then so is
the entire remailer system. Prime remailer operators are those who don't
Maybe message size would tip off snoopers. This can be overcome with minor
tweaking to existing remailer code by tacking on or or eliminating padding
to messages. But logging still makes the whole system extremely vulnerable.
Agreed. But since the payment "on the way out" (i.e.; a store) is much
less desirable (and would probably work to reduce traffic), payment "on the way in" (i.e.; the subway) seems like the preferred alternative.

Eric Hughes replied:
While this may be possible, the argument that someone actively tried to
remain uninformed about something "dangerous" or potentially "illegal"
doesn't seem like a particularly strong defense. Someone with proper
credentials might want to comment on whether intentional ignorance is
sufficient to avoid culpability.
