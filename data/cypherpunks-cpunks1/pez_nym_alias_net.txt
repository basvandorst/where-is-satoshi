Think before you write. I suppose paranoia about terrorist threats
is in the cypherpunk spirit? Perhaps paranoia about those evil criminals
with the big guns coming and hurting us? Gosh, I'm a cypherpunk, I need
to be paranoid about these things! Let's give up all our rights so the
government can protect us!
