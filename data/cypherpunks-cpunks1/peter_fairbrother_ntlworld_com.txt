I have received, in chronological order and without censorship (moderation),
the following replies to this email:
"Name Wanted: Torturing passwords out of people with threats of (?repeated)
beatings is usually called rubberhose cryptanalysis.
What should torturing passphrases out of people with threats of (?repeated)
imprisonment be called? Rubberlaw? Legalhose? ":
Psycho torture
Threat torture
Scare mugging
Psyche raping
Psyche terrorism
Psyche terrorizing
Police terrorism
Terror tactics
Threat tactics
contempt cryptanalysis
Jailhouse cryptanalysis
due process extremely wrong government policy soapbending cryptoanalysis
a "known key" attack
Solitary Cryptanalysis (rather than sharing a cell with "BIG Marv[he's deaf
but very BIG]" or "Fingers McMadbastard")  *
Pants, and have Pantyhose cryptanalysis
the Royal Screw
Her Majesty's Thumbscrews
HM's nipple electrodes
Mr. Blair's Wild Ride
I'd call them both "coercion cryptanalysis".
VIRTUAL PANCAKEVILLE
Beyond 1984 Captive Captivity
CRYPTOCRACY Contempt of Court cryptanalysis
Porridge Cryptanalysis (after a British slang word for prison, and a BBC
comedy series)
Scrubs Cryptanalysis
Wormwood Cryptanalysis (after Wormwood Scrubs, a famous London prison).
San Quentin cryptanalysis
Alcatraz cryptanalysis (the famous jail/island in San Francisco)
Changi cryptanalysis (the jail in Singapore)
Cryptanalysis by writ
Ball and chain cryptanalysis
handcuff cryptanalysis
Horsehair, after the ludicrous headgear.
I guess I'll use:
Courthouse Cryptanalysis
which wasn't on the list, and call rubberhose- and courthouse- subsets of
coercive- cryptanalysis,
unless you think YOU know BETTER, EH?

@_subject: Public Anonymity (Re: FIPR Release 16/10/2001: EMERGENCY POWERS 
This is simply wrong. There are several techniques which can provide public
anonymity, ie anonymity when _all_ parts of the communication system are
compromised. Some are well-known.
I have been working on this for some time, for possible inclusion in
m-o-o-t. I'm thinking of publishing a paper on this soon, and I have
attached part of an early draft of the introduction, which gives an
overview. It's just notes, I haven't finished it, so don't expect total
accuracy (or clarity).
