@_subject: mail2news gateway (fwd) 
Anyone has more info
For the past several weeks, a right wing extremist group in Topeka, Kansas has been
tampering with mail2news gateways, including yours, to prevent several people who
oppose their hate agenda from posting to the usenet through your gateway.
The affected gateways include at least alt.revisionism, alt.christnet, alt.politics.homosexuality
and alt.abortion. Posts are returned "user unknown" suggesting that the mailbox may
have been deleted.
This is a group of *fanatics* (Westboro Baptist Church) whose website godhatesfags.com
may be known to you. They also operate several other websites under aliases the best-known
of which is revwhite.bestsites.net. They advocate murdering abortion clinic workers,
homosexuals and blacks.
'Rev White' (actually a member of the Fred Phelps family aka Westboro Baptist Church)
was responsible for conducting a reign of terrorism last year (see "WIRED" magazine,
Jan. 1997) against the irc that included death threats and operator sabotage. Several
in this group are highly skilled in hacking and are willing to spend whatever time
it takes launching denial of service attacks so that some of their opponents' viewpoints
can't be posted. And they're willing to do this everyday if necessary to harass and
intimidate others into silence. Several of them have criminal records in Topeka.
I'm writing to ask you in the name of fair play to re-open these gateways and do
whatever is necessary to keep them open. Better yet, I hope you can kept them in
the act like a Canadian ISP did and report them to
Special Agent Tom Maiorana
300 U.S. Courthouse
Kansas City, MO 64106
Thank you for whatever assistance  you can be in this matter.

: : Maybe it's time for Alex to join this thread and either say "no, we don't
: filter on any words at the Replay remailer", or else "yes, here's a list
: of the words we consider to be objectionable, so please omit them from
: your posts through the Replay remailer".
As stated before we do not filter.

@_subject: PGP 5 SDK 
Georg.Uphoff at uni-konstanz.de sez:
: Does anyone know where you can get PGP 5 SDK  except PGP.Inc. ?
: It would be lovely if it be free and under circumvention of U.S. : export control !
Unfortunately one .dll in the win32 file seems corrupt (bad crc),
so until that get's fixed you can do with unix.
: Thanks in advance.
: Nappy

Lucky Green sez:
: Is anyone familiar with tools that can be used to : obscure source code so that it builds, but no longer
: contains comments or useful variable or procedure
: names?
I believe HP once was forced to supply sourcecode to
a French guvmint agency. They did just that, the source they
supplied would compile but there were no clues inside.
(don't have a ref for this story though) The French weren't

@_subject: Remailer Attack 
Anonymous sez:
: According to Raph's remailer stats, the remailers have widely varying
: latencies.  Given that only a few remailers have latencies which are
: acceptably low, the list of usable remailers is quite low.
: If the user of the remailer, Monty Cantsin for example, signs his
: messages, a fairly accurate measure of total transit time is obtained.
: The total transit time gives clues to the remailers which were
: actually used in the chain.  In an of itself, this may not comprise
: the user, but combined with other weaknesses it will cause the
: attacker to be significantly more confident of identification
: hypotheses.
: The remailers should all have about the same latency.  0 seconds seems
: like a good Schelling point.  What would it take to reduce remailer
: latency to under 60 seconds for most of the remailers?  Do people need
: old 486s to dedicate to the task?  Do they need money?  Better
: software?
Most remailers support a feature called 'latency', so one can
choose the latency one desires for a message.

@_subject: Remailers and ecash 
: Then Mr. Cantsin seemed to go back to the all you need are some spare parts
: theory of remailer operation.  Enormous profits of $200 per month, or even
: $5,000 per year.  Well, Cracker handles close to 25% of worldwide remailer
: traffic of it's kind[1].  And it's not much.  I would say this is due
: mainly to the user interface.  Making remailers more difficult to use by
: adding Ecash is not going to increase traffic significantly.
Basicly most of those 3400 message cracker handles daily are cover trafic,
a big chunk of the rest is from people "playing" around with the remailer,
then there are those few that needs some form of anonimity so they can inform
a mailinglist/postmaster/complaints department, and then maybe once a week
or so there is that message that would be paid for if remailers were for pay.
So in short, if remailers were to be paid for, traffic would halt.
