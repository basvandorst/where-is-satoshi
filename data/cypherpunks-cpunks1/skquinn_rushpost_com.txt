How the hell can they trademark something that generic?
Would the NYC MTA really sue for trademark infringement in a case like
this? Seems to me it would be asking for loads of bad PR. (And
unfortunately, should I travel to NYC I don't have many other reasonable
choices for transportation...)

I think Phil is referring to traffic analysis. We solved this problem
already somewhat with Mixmaster, but it's cumbersome to impossible to
use for everyday email.

I like the concept, but not with the ad for commercial PGP at the
expense of GnuPG and others. Though I think the following poster who
suggested scanning the email itself for the PGP identifier might be more
useful and less prone to being fooled by someone who just puts the
header in there without actually encrypting. Also, headers don't have to
be in a specific order, it's possible that "From:" or "Subject:"
accidentally get moved ahead of "X-PGP-Encrypted:" by mistake and that
would result in a false bounce.

I can believe it has for 11 years and change, but 12 years would mean
starting 7-8 months before 9/11. Sorry if it seems like I'm splitting
hairs, but I don't remember things getting really bad until a few months
after 9/11.
