Mats Bergstrom  says:
Many laws passed in the last decade have penalties which are coercive rather
than punitive.  The real intent is to force the accused to give up his
accomplices.  In fact, law enforcement has had some successes employing this
tactic, but at what cost!

There was some discussion recently concerning problems which could arise
if the U.S. federal government had a medical database on its citizens.
One example of abuse of medical records is documented in the report of
the "Krever Royal Commission on the Confidentiality of Health Records",
published in 1980 in Canada.  In the particular case I'm citing, a (now
disbanded) RCMP (federal police) dirty-tricks squad obtained medical
records of a dissident, and used them for disruptive tactics.  Quoting
from page 45:
"The letter distributed at King Edward School attempted to use accurate health information to sow dissension, disruption and distrust among the
members of the Young Socialists.  The three letters were written and distributed by the RCMP.  Superintendent Ian William Taylor ... expressly
admitted that the letters addressed to Mr. Riddell and the letter distributed at the King Edward School were written by members of the RCMP
with the authorization of senior RCMP officers."
One of the letters begins as follows:
We have been most disturbed by indications of increasing emotional instability on your part, witnessed by psychiatric consultations, violent
outbursts of temper and frequent periods of irritability.  We note too
from the enclosed letter that your condition has not escaped the notice
of others."  (etc.)
Please note that I have no sympathy at all with the political objectives
of this group, but I think the incident is a good example of the sort of
abuse which can result when highly personal records are accessible by a

won't let it stop me from continuing on, but what's the CypherPUNKs is an offshoot of the cyberpunk paradigm, which can be
stated as "high tech/lowlife".  There are no claims of professionalism

probably their enjoyment of the _practice_ of encryption and related

Now that we've had our debate, I withdraw any objections I've made to
the proposed lawsuit.  I just don't like to see the courts used as a
first resort in cases of conflict.  It also seems to me that personation
and forgery are more serious offences than libel and plagiarism.
On the subject of legal actions by pseudonymous entities, while I am
regrettably ignorant of U.S. copyright laws, readers here might find it
interesting that the new Canadian Copyright Act guarantees the right of
an author to write under a pseudonym. For example:
        Section 14.1. Moral Rights
        (1) The author of a work has, subject to section 28.2, the right
            to the integrity of the work and, in connection with an act
            mentioned in section 3, the right, where reasonable in the
            circumstances, to be associated with the work as its author
            by name or under a pseudonym and the right to remain
            anonymous.                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            ^^^^^^^^^
        (2) No assignment of moral rights.-- Moral rights may not be
            assigned, but may be waived in whole or in part.
Section 3, referred to above, gives the author the sole right to
produce, reproduce, perform, publish, convert, and - in the case of
art - to communicate by telecommunication.
        Section 28.2. Nature of Right of Integrity
        (1) The author's right to the integrity of a work is infringed
            only if the work is, to the prejudice of the honour or
            reputation of the author,
            (a) distorted, mutilated, or otherwise modified; or
            (b) used in association with a product, service, cause or
                institution.
Under the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention, these
rights are enforceable in other countries only if those countries
guarantee the same rights to their own citizens.
Speculation: With the incursion of lawyers and lawsuits into the
network, Internet Service Providers (ISP's) will need to purchase
liability insurance. The insurance premiums will vary inversely with the
freedom of clients under acceptable usage agreements.  Thus ISP's will
have a sound business reason to reduce customer priviledges :-(

There's a simpler solution.  Using the majordomo hack I posted earlier,
mail from known abusers would be bounced to the moderator for his
approval or rejection.  This would be a small volume, which should
be within the capabilities of one moderator.
It's important to note that even abusive posters have their moments
of lucidity.  For example, one or two of Detwelier's posts were
actually worth reading.  So a wholesale and automatic filtering
would be wrong.
As for the marginal stuff, it should be passed for redistribution,
and the end-users should be educated on means to do their own
filtering.  For example, here's a simple scheme to employ the
filter distributed with ELM:
.forward file: "|/path/to/filter -vo $HOME/.elm/filter-errors"
.elm/filter-rules file:
if (from = "lassie") then save "~/mail/nal"
if (to contains "cypherpunks") then save "~/mail/Cypher"

@_subject: Unicorn vs. tmp@netcom 
Recently Black Unicorn posted that he had sued tmp at netcom, and settled
out of court.  A couple of messages followed which were supportive of
his action.  The text below is a rebuke to Unicorn.  I post it in the
hope that it will provide dimension to the debate.
To Black Unicorn:
Once upon a time, two strangers found a dog.  Alice said, "That's my dog:
I can clearly tell by its markings".  Bob said, "No, I'm afraid you're
mistaken.  See his ears pick up when I call his name".  And so the debate
continued, until a third person, Sol, arrived.  On hearing the pleadings
of Bob and Alice, Sol told them, "Stand 10 meters apart and put the dog
between you".  Sol the scared the dog with a quick movement and a shout,
and the dog ran to its true master.
Likewise, when you were tested recently by net abuse, you went for
relief to your master, the government.  This is what distinguishes you
from the rest of us.  We might react against the abuse (or we might
not), but I think that none of us - or at least a very few - would have
gone to court for relief.
       "I spoke to a Federal Court of Appeals Judge who I have known for
        a number of years to try and poke some holes in the suit on
        substantive merits."
Despite your protestation, "I also don't like to be a bully", it seems
to me that your pursuit of this case was predicated on your ability to
be a bully and an insider.  Like your colleagues Cantor and Seigel, you
emitted flamebait and then pretended offense at the inevitable flames.
You taunted tmp at netcom about his illness, reminding him at least three
times in one message to take his medicine.  Nice behaviour for a person
who supposedly believes in privacy.  It seems to me that you sized up
tmp at netcom as a person who could not fight back due to his illness, and
then you provoked him in order to establish grounds for your suit.  I
believe that your case, which is apparently based upon testimony from
your friends, could not have succeeded in court.  But it didn't have to,
did it?  You only had to find someone who was ill, and then kick him
while he was down.
Was it Rousseau who said, "First, we kill all the lawyers"?  The cost of
a lawsuit in the U.S. today can easily be over $100,000.  The cost of a
contract murder is said to be $10,000-$50,000.  Consider the economics.
I think there is a role to be played by lawyers in the future of the
net. The net does not like litigation, because it interferes with the
free flow of information.  But it does like protocols, which are seen to
enhance the flow of information.  Lawyers, by their training and
practice, are especially good at formulating workable protocols.  If we
had a protocol governing the use of network resources by sick or abusive
users, your conflict with tmp at netcom might not have transpired, or else
a solution might have been easily achieved.  Conflicts like this are
resulting in conversion of newsgroups on Usenet to moderated groups - a
very unfortunate trend in my opinion, as Usenet does not provide for the
removal of moderators.  Here is a proper outlet for legal talent, not in
self-serving time-wasting resource-absorbing litigation.

You might want to check out Brian LaMacchia's Ph.D. proposal to create
a new class of knowbot, to be termed "Internet Fish".  It is posted on LaMacchia's proposal is interesting in that his 'fish' seem to have limited autonomy, thus moving us closer to a content-addressable model
of net info retrieval.
Also of interest is RFC 1728: Resource Transponders, by C. Weider.  The
idea is that there should be meta-information (information about information) available for use by info retrieval programs like 'archie'.  The following is extracted from LaMacchia's abstract:
