I'm probably just stating things that have been hashed out here long ago,
but I'll voice my opinions anyway... Clueless about the net? I'd say Congress and the "CDAmeisters" are, but the NSA most certainly isn't.
With ATM machines and the like, "Cyberspace is where your money is". I don't remember who said that.
Cyberspace used to be a good word to use, but it's been cliche'ed by the technotrendies. :(
The media coverage of the sensationalist (violent and/or sexual) crime has given the law makers and enforcers an excuse to step things up. It's not quite as bad up here in Canada, but where the US goes, Canada (and probably the rest of the world) usually follows.
I'm particulary concerned about Clipper and it's variants... It doesn't
take a rocket scientist to figure out that Real Criminals will use Real
Encryption (IMHO Real != Escrowed) even if Real Encryption is illegal... Surely the NSA knows that Real Crypto will be just as easy to find as
pirated software, and criminals will use it. Thus, Clipper will only
enable the government (most likely the NSA) to spy on law abiding
I think it would be paranoid to assume the above, but naive to ignore it. Clipper may be some sinister plot by the NSA to grab power, or...
It may just be a last ditch effort to maintain the power they already
have. After all, nobody wants to lose their job, and the NSA is no
different from the rest of us in that regard. This is my first post to the Cypherpunks... So what government black lists does this get me on?

Sure, the Netscape extensions are nice. And it's nice to have an operating
system (M$-DOG) pre-installed on every hard drive. But Net$cape, like M$,
was trying to esablish a dominant "follow-us-or-die" position in the industry. Yes, the Net$cape extensions allow people to do stuff that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do. But, the extensions *could have* been implemented in such a way that using them wouldn't be detrimental to non-Net$cape browsers. Instead, they've altered the World Wide Web in such a way that it can only be viewed "correctly" with Net$cape.
The rest of your post was quite interesting. I *do* think it would be good to have multiple, interchangeable formats like we do for graphics. What we really need to make that happen are DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS.

Of course not. If they "protected" their creations with patents, a lot of people would be less likely to use them. If the Net$cape extensions weren't used, everything would look fine on other browsers and there would be no pressure on the remaining non-netscape users (25%?) to switch to Net$cape.
The "Why" can be answered very easily: $$$. Netscape is not some
not-for-profit thing like PGP, Netscape is a COMMERCIAL CORPORATION. Keep
that in mind while I explain the "How"...... I think it is not unlike what Micro$oft did in the early 80s... They put
out a good OS (it was considered good at that time) and sold it really
cheap, and they obtained a large market share. Since they had such a large
market share, most of the software developers wrote for M$-DOS. Since
practically everyone was writing for MS-DOS, the public bought MS-DOS. Other OS developers could write M$-DOS clones, but they would be just
that- clones. They would have no reason to write in new features, since
very few people would be bold enough to write software that wouldn't run
on M$-DOS. The OS makers would be condemned to forever follow Micro$oft
and try to maintain compatability. To this day, the mass market still
centers around the MS operating system. With Netscape, it was similar... They put out a good browser (And I'm not
arguing there- IMHO it's the best browser currently available) for really
cheap, for many people it was even Free. They've obtained a large market
share. Since they have such a large market share, everyone writes web
pages for Net$cape. Since there are now so many "Get Netscape!" web pages,
even more people are switching to Netscape. Sure, other browsers could add
their own extensions, but if they won't work on Net$scape, nobody will use
them. And every non-net$cape browser will be OBSOLETE as soon as the next
version of net$cape comes along with it's new extensions. No arm twisting was necessary, once Net$scape had their large market share. Just as there was no arm twisting to get people to write software for MS-DOS and Windoze. Once a software company has a large enough market share that they can define the standards for everyone else, they are extremely difficult to "de-throne". At least Net$cape isn't abandoning the *official* HTML standards.
Before I sign off, I will say that Netscape is a good browser. It may well
be that they simply created the extensions to make the WWW better. But,
since Netscape *IS* a commercial company, I tend to believe that they did
it to ensure their own profits. Really, there is no Real Proof either way, so this tends to be a rather controversial (and opinionated) topic.
Some good might yet come from this... If Netscape and Microsoft start battling over the "Web As An Operating System" market, Net$cape and Micro$oft might chip away at each other enough to let the smaller companies catch up. (Wishfull Thinking)
I guess this is kinda off the topic of the Cypherpunks list... I think we should just "agree that we disagree" and let the matter be.

But, would the average jury understand what a RNG is? The prosecution
would probably argue that "It's a tool used by terrorists and child
pornographers so that they can create 'codes' to communicate with each
other". If they say that, they could probably even supress any
explaination of what a RNG actually is, by claiming that it's "to
dangerous to allow into public record". The Phrack E911 document was
supressed in that way. In some countries I could see people being charged with an offence just
for having a RNG... The output looks encrypted, and I heard that in France

I think we all know how stupid that would be... Way too easy for someone to put their own face on a card. For it to be effective, there would have to be some central Big Brotherly computer with all the faces stored there. Mind you, from that British study, it seems that fudging the face isn't really necessary. :-/
I recall, some months ago there were plans to have a fingerprinting system
at the Canada/US border and people could get accross faster if they had a
card with their fingerprint stored on it. Even the news media was able to

@_subject: Scientologists may subpoena anonymous remailer records 
When a person recieves a message from someone using an anonymous remailer, the return address will usually work, depending on the remailer. The return address is for an address on the remailer, and sending to that address, the remailer will forward the message back to the person who owns that anonymous address.
The problem with that, of course, is that the remailer has to keep a record of who owns each anonymous account, so that it can direct the replies to the anonymous person. These records could be siezed.
Also (not related to the records), if the remailer does not encrypt the replies that it forwards to the anonymous owner, it would be *very* vunlerable to traffic analysis... Just watch for your message leaving the remailer, and see the address of the anonymous person, or the address of the next remailer in the chain.
I don't really know much about remailers, but I don't think there's much
to know... If I'm mistaken about any of the above, I'm sure someone will
correct me. BTW, has anyone out there created an anonymous web forwarder? I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who don't like the idea of having their email address in the log files of dozens of web servers... Creating a simple web forwarder wouldn't be hard.

I have an idea....
Create a special "unsubscrive mailing list". Anyone who sends
"unsubscrive" to a mailing list is removed from that list, and placed on
this special "unsubscrive list". When anyone is annoyed by the latest wave
of "unsubscrive"s, they can (after first moving the offenders to the
special unsubscrive list) send their own "unsubscrive" messages out to
that list, which will then copy it mailing-list-style to everyone who has
improperly used any mailing lists. The idiots on the list will also try to
send out their own "unsubscrive" messages trying to get off the special
list, which will of course end up back in their mailboxes and in the
mailboxes of all the other idiots. Eventually they will "graduate" by figuring out the CORRECT way to
unsubscribe, and the list server will obey any unsubscribe commands it
actually recieves. Having learned the hard way, they will never forget.

Maybe the average person is trying to learn these things without learning
the basics, and thus ends up clueless about everything... If people don't
understand how text, programs, images, sound, video, and eventually ALL

I'd be interested to see those calculations. If 128 bit keys would require
sqr(509485193) supernovas, I think we probably don't need to go much
higher with the number of bits.  OTOH, if the feds can somehow figure out
how to convert all the matter in the solar system into energy, they might
be able to get enough energy... e=mc^2... But, there wouldn't be anywhere
to put the computers. :)
While we're exchanging calculations.... I've done some simple calculations myself (which have probably already
been done, but anyway...), regarding 128 bit keys, assuming a billion
(10**9) computers trying a billion keys per second... I heard it would
take an average of 6 billion years to crack a 128 bit key with those
resources, but my calculations (using GNU bc v1.02 under FreeBSD) figure
it at over 5 trillion years... echo "2^128 / 10^9 / 10^9 / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25)" | bc
With commas, that's 10,782,897,524,556 years. Cut that in half (for
average cracking time), it comes to 5,391,448,762,278 years. I don't know where I heard the 6 billion year figure, it might have been in the Wired Cypherpunks article, but I think I read it somewhere else as well... Is my calculation okay?
Similar calculation... Assume you have a 384 bit key that you want to
brute-force, and you have 10^73 computers trying 10^9 calculations per
second. (Last I heard, 10^73 is the number of particles in the universe). echo "2^384 / 10^73 / 10^9 / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25)" | bc
That's an impressive number. :)
As an aside, I've heard that "billion" and "trillion" are different in different parts of the world...
           Western   British
billion     10^9      10^12
trillion    10^12     10^18

@_subject: Protocols at the Point of a Gun 
Security classification and "decent/indecent" ratings are rather
different, IMHO. With security, the author of the data has to decide the
best rating for his/her own security. With decent/indecent filtering, the
author has to decide what is best for _other_people_. I suppose it's not as bad as that with the third-party ratings in PICS, but there will still be inconsistancies.
The main reason I think decent/indecent filtering should be done at the
application level is, if they create a ratings system and later decide
that they've screwed up and another system would be better (which is quite
possible, if you understand the previous paragraph), all that's really
required is re-writing the application software. OTOH, if they did it at
the transport layer and later decided to switch to something else, they
would have to change the protocol, which is very difficult. And, depending
on the changes, they may have to re-write the apps again anyways. Also, at the application layer, ANYONE could create their own ratings
system, and the market could decide which is best. (The downside of that is that there would be nonstandardized chaos for a while).

Handwriting, fingerprints, and voice (not to mention name and appearance)
are still used exclusively for idenitification. Breath and urine (items
that I added when I mentioned the war on drugs) are used exclusively for
detecting chemicals (although I think DNA can be found in urine). Just my two bits. That's all I'm willing to spend on this discussion. Only time will tell whether or not the courts will force people to provide

Financially, RSA *does* have a hell of a lot to gain from relaxed export controls. OTOH, I would think that other companies would be able to sell RSA-patented encryption, just not to inside the USA (IANAL). Of course, that inside-the-USA factor is a very big one.
IMNSHO, relaxed export controls would be much better than the status

You don't understand the problem we're concerned about... The problem is,

Suppose John Doe is using the pseudonym "Evil Bastard". Naturally, he has
a PGP key for his Evil Bastard identity. Now suppose someone gets into his
computer. This person would be able to find Evil Bastard's secret key. Fortunately, the snoop would not be able to use the key, since it would be
encrypted with a secure PGP passphrase. However, they would still be able
to use the command "pgp -kvv secring.pgp", and that shows the key ID of
each secret key. The key ID is the lower 64 bits of the public key, but it's included in
unencrypted form on the secret keyring as well, to identify the secret
key. The person who snooped the secret keyring would be able to see that
John Doe has the secret key with the ID of (for example) 13579BDF. Since
the ID of Evil Bastard's well-known public key is also 13579BDF, the snoop
now knows that John Doe is in posession of a secret key that corresponds
to Evil Bastard's public key, which proves that John Doe *IS* Evil Bastard.

I'm sure this can be compacted further. I haven't put a lot of work into
compacting it; I really just want to get it out. Run the program, type in a LOT of random gibberish (several lines at
least) and press enter. Then wait. Eventually it will output your p, q, n,
e and d in hexadecimal. p and q: Prime numbers, congruent to 2 mod e. They can usually be
discarded, but they should never be revealed. n: Your public modulus
e: Your public encryption exponent (usually 10001 hex)
d: Your private decryption exponent
By default the program generates a 768-bit public modulus and a public
exponent of 10001 hex (65537 decimal). These can be changed by adjusting
the numbers in the first line. A 1024-bit modulus would be better, but for
some reason generation takes a LOT longer than a 768-bit modulus.
Fortunately key generation doesn't need to be done very often. Timings on a 100 MHz Pentium running FreeBSD:
Size of n  Time
512-bit:   4-5 minutes
768-bit:   8-9 minutes
1024-bit:  35-80 minutes (ack!)
I've had some difficulty generating 1024-bit keys, but it seems to be
working now. Let me know if you see any problems generating large keys
other than the obvious problem with the time spent. Disclaimer: This program seems to work, but your milage may vary.

@_subject: Another possible remailer attack? 
Suppose you operate an ISP and you suspect that one of your users (let's
call him Dimitri) is using anonymous remailers to submit politically
incorrect messages (under a pseudonym, or all with the same writing style)
to Usenet, mailing lists, and a well-known phreak/hack publication. Also
suppose that these public messages are appearing on a regular basis. You want to know if Dimitri is the person regularly posting these
messages. So, you use your powers as ISP to block his access to all
remailers. If the public messages suddenly stop then you can be reasonably
certain that Dimitri was sending them. I expect this would work even against DC nets.
The only solution I can think of is to have an account with multiple ISPs
and always send mail from more than one account. This probably wouldn't
offer much protection against TLAs (NSA, CIA, FBI, MCI, AT&T ;) who may be
able to block traffic no matter where it comes from.

@_subject: Another possible remailer attack? 
Packet filtering at the ISP's router. If Dimitri can't connect to a
remailer, he can't send anonymous messages. Sure there are a lot of hacks
that could be done (like have sendmail on another system send it to a
remailer) but such things could be detected and blocked by clever filters.
In fact, the ISP could just claim to be "going down for maintenance" and
completely block Dimitri from the internet for a while. Isolating spy transmitters by selectively cutting power is exactly
alalogous to what I have suggested.

@_subject: PGP3.0 & ElGamal 
The Meet In The Middle attack (MITM, not to be confused with Man In The
Middle) is a time-memory tradeoff that works against any multiple
encryption. Triple encryption:
ciphertext = encrypt(k3, decrypt(k2, encrypt(k1, plaintext)))
plaintext  = decrypt(k3, encrypt(k2, decrypt(k1, ciphertext)))
An MITM attack, as I understand it, works by decrypting from one end and encrypting from the other...
Step 1- decrypt(x3, ciphertext) for every possible x3, and store all the
results. This requires 2^56 operations and 2^56*8 bytes (550 petabytes?)
of memory when done against 3DES. Quite a lot, but it might be doable. Step 2- decrypt(x2, encrypt(x1, plaintext)) for every possible x1,x2. This require 2^112 steps with 3DES. If the result you get can be found in
the table built by step 1 then you've figured all three keys.

@_subject: Is /dev/random good enough to generate one-time pads? 
I expect it would be "good enough", but it is not _perfectly_ random, and so it wouldn't be a true one-time pad.
Because it uses MD5, the bits are not all provably independent. You get (very strong) cryptographic security instead of perfect security.
The one-time pad is easy to explain in theory, but implementing it
perfectly is extremely difficult. Many people believe that quantum events
are the only source of perfect randomness, but most methods for harvesting
that randomness could introduce statistical properties. For example, a
radioactive substance may have exactly a 50% chance of emitting a particle
given a certain amount of time, but what happens if your timer isn't
perfect? One-way hashes are good at removing such obvious and not-so-obvious
statistical properties, but like a PRNG, you can't prove that the bits it
produces are all completely independent. It's definately "good enough",
but it's not perfect.

@_subject: Q.E.D. 
No, not the Bible, or the Koran, or the Torah. Try information theory. A PRNG is not a OTP.
A PRNG, like all cryptography (except the OTP) can be broken. Some
cryptography can be broken by cryptanalytic "shortcuts". _All_ ciphers can
be broken by brute force. If it is a strong cipher, there are no known
shortcuts, and the keysize is great enough that brute force is infeasable. A stream cipher operating in OFB mode _seems_ a lot like a one-time pad. With the stream cipher, you XOR the output of the PRNG with the plaintext,
which produces the ciphertext. With a OTP, it's the same, except you use a
true RNG instead of a PRNG. Implementation-wise, they seem almost identical, the only real difference being that key management with the stream cipher is a lot easier. Cryptanalysis-wise there is a _very_ big difference. No. Here we get to the difference between a OTP and a regular cipher: A OTP doesn't have a key, just a truely random stream.
A OTP is very difficult to use, because of the size of the random stream.
A OTP can't be broken AT ALL, not even by brute force.
A OTP is information theoritically secure.
A cipher has a key that produces a pseudo-random stream.
A cipher is not hard to use, because the key is relatively short. A good cipher can be broken by brute force, but the attack isn't practical. A good cipher is cryptographically secure.
Here's an example of a OTP...
----- From Applied Cryptography 2nd edition, pages 15-16 ----
If the message is
 ONETIMEPAD and the key sequence from the pad is  TBFRGFARFM then the ciphertext is
 IPKLPSFHGO
 O + T mod 26 = I
 N + B mod 26 = P
 E + F mod 26 = K
 etc.
Assuming an evesdropper can't get access to the one-time pad used to encrypt the message, this scheme is perfectly secure. A given ciphertext message is equally likely to correspond to any possible plaintext message of equal size.
Since every key sequence is equally likely (remember, the key letters are generated randomly), an adversary has no information with which to cryptanalyze the ciphertext. The key sequence could just as likely be:
 POYYAEAAZX
which would decrypt to:
 SALMONEGGS
 BXFGBMTMXM
which would decrypt to:
 GREENFLUID
This point bears repeating: Since every plaintext message is equally possible, there is no way for the cryptanalyst to determine which plaintext message is the correct one. A random key sequence added to a nonrandom plaintext message produced a completely random ciphertext message and no amount of computing power can challenge that.
----- End of excerpt -----
With a PRNG there are a limited number of outputs, so there might not be
any key to produce POYYAEAAZX or BXFGBMTMXM, and so by brute-force an
attacker may determine that the plaintext is not SALMONEGGS or GREENFLUID
or whatever else. With enough PRNG-encrypted ciphertext, it is possible to
rule out all but one possible plaintext. This is how a brute-force attack
works. With a OTP, brute-force won't work, because no plaintexts can be
ruled out. I took a quick look at the algorithm on your web page, and it is
definately a PRNG.

@_subject: towards an eternity service 
I don't know much about secret sharing algorithms, but wouldn't the server
be able to get the other parts of the shares and know what it's serving?
The ability to get that information might affect server liability. With secret splitting, there is a simple way to create duress parts. I don't know if it's possible with secret sharing..
X is politically-incorrect data.
Y is data nobody would ever object to.
R is a truely random string of bits.
Alice has X xor R on her server.
Bob has R on his server.
Carol has X xor Y xor R on her server.
Dave has Y xor R on his server.
Alice and Bob are together distributing X. So are Dave and Carol. However, if someone were to say that Alice and Bob (and/or Dave and Carol)
are distibuting something politically incorrect, Alice and Carol (and Bob
and Dave) can get together and say "No, We're distributing Y. The other
person must be trying to frame me!". In fact, it's quite possible that
Alice thought she was distributing Y with Carol, and that Bob thought he
was also distributing Y with Dave. If they did not split the secrets
themselves, they may not have any knowledge of X's existence. Also, if any
one of the participants gets shut down, it's still possible to retrieve X,
Y and R by using different combinations of the remaining three
participants. This scenario could be extended to more participants and
secrets.

@_subject: really undetectable crypto made somewhat practical 
I'm on FCPUNX instead of regular Cypherpunks, so please excuse me if I'm a
little behind the thread. As a slight improvement, you could turn this into a complete stealth
encryption scheme, using only the one-way hash function operating as a
MAC. Instead of hashing just the word in an effort to get stego bits, you could
hash a key along with the word. In order to get the intended hash you
would need to know the key. Since you're probably hashing a whole block of
512 bits (or whatever's specified in the algorithm) appending a key should
not affect the speed of the system. I'm certain that this would increase
the security, possibly enough that you wouldn't need to use a regular
encryption algorithm (but I wouldn't bet on it). Crude example:
Assume that Alice can use the words "Greetings" and "Salutations"
interchangably without drawing suspicion. Also assume that "PASSWD" is a
secret known only to Alice and Bob, and that the stego software looks at
the low bit of an MD5 hash. MD5 ("GreetingsPASSWD")   = c7bf6e051731a0dcf52baa330c9d2e7d  <- low bit=1
MD5 ("SalutationsPASSWD") = 2dd2ba080b5feb060ffbc6d196fd1b34  <- low bit=0
If you say "Greetings" you're sending a 1, if you say "Salutations" you're sending a 0. Eve doesn't know about "PASSWD" so she can't do the
hash and figure the bit. Of course, if you're using this to send more
bits, you'll need something harder to guess than "PASSWD". The trick is in figuring out which words have stego bits and which don't. It might be better to stego bits into a whole line instead of a word, as
that would probably offer more flexibility.

It's not hard to use. Allocate a SHA1_CTX, initialize it with SHA1Init()
run over the data with SHA1Update() and finally extract the result using
SHA1Final(). Or just compile the program as-is and use it to hash files. It's reasonably fast (the 80 core SHA operations look good) but I'm

I think a completely known-plaintext attack would not impress the
masses. Consider how often crypto illiterate programmers implement
ciphers (such as Vigenere variants) which are obviously vulnerable to
known-plaintext attacks. The idea seems to be that if you know the
plaintext, what do you need the key for? _We_ may know better, but I
think we are in the minority.
For a slight increase in the computational requirements, we could end up
with a break that the "DES is good enough" people would have a _much_
harder time downplaying.
