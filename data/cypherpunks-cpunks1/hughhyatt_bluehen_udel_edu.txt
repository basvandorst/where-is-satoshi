This would eliminate the public's ability to learn interesting and
important facts like those published here (also by Mr McCullagh):
  For example,
"According to government statistics, in 1998 police intercepted
2,313,210 conversations but the taps -- 71% were for drug-related
crimes -- resulted in only 911 convictions."  Was that a reasonable
trade-off between security and freedom?  And how else can we, the
people, make such judgments without having facts like these?

  The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal
  vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the
     consequence of his crime, and the punishment of his guilt.
