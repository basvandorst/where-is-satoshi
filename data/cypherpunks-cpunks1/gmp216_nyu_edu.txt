@_subject: cryptography license negotiation 
I am working on negotiating a licensing agreement for a large piece of software that contains a cryptographic component. I am trying to negotiate a warranty term that favors us in the event that the algorithm or implementation should prove insecure. Ideally I would like 1) disclosure of the algorithm and 2) a representation that cryptographic experts consider the algorithm is considered secure or at least appropriate to the use being made of it.
Has anybody ever negotiated something like this with a software vendor? Can anyone produce sample language from a licensing agreement? Is there a better place I can ask this question? ("get a lawyer" is not a helpful response. IAAL). Thanks for your help
