Reserve a room for the nights of February 4th and 5th under the
ShmooCon group code at the Marriot Wardman Park Hotel by January 1st,
or while rooms last, and you will be entered in the in the first
annual ShmooCon Reserve-a-Room Raffle--which includes food, wireless
gear, Washington Wizards tickets, and believe it or not, a very sexy
OQO Model 01.
What's an OQO Model 01?  Check it out:
And you could have a chance to get one at ShmooCom 2005.  But only if
you reserve a room at the con hotel for ShmooCon!  Hurry!  We have a
limited number of rooms set aside for conference attendees!  More
information is HERE:
Specifically, you can reserve a room online with our group code via
the following link:
Check in on the 4th.  Check out on the 6th.
Note, and NOT mentioned on the website, we have exactly 100 rooms set
aside for the nights of the 4th and the 5th, and over 30 have already
been reserved as of this Monday.  That number appears to be steadily
dwindling, so heads up.

@_subject: [ShmooCon-News] Saturday night's con 
Saturday night's fun has basically been finalized, so it's time to
clue attendees in.  ShmooCon 2005 attendees are invited to boogie at
FUR, a rather hip dance club in D.C., Saturday night, February 5th,
from 10 to whenever.  Check out FUR's website here:
FUR is letting all ShmooCon 2005 attendees, 21 and over, in for FREE.
The private speaker party with open bar in the Mafia lounge at FUR
runs from 10 to midnight, and features spinning by everyone's favorite
West-coast, DefCon & ToorCon-infamous DJ, Keith!  w00t!
Anyone who reserved a room at the conference hotel under the ShmooCon
group rate will get a pass to the speaker party once they check-in at
the hotel.
If you didn't reserve a room at the conference hotel, or you aren't a
speaker, then you'd better practice on your social engineering skills
to score a pass to the speaker party.  Rumor has it, speakers will
have extra passes to distribute as they see fit. ;)
And one more note: FUR, not the Shmoo Group, controls the dress
code--read the FUR FAQ here:
So no whining about having to look (and smell) nice.  Got it?  See you
at FUR on Saturday night of the con!
