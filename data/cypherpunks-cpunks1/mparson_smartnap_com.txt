@_subject: Lock and Load 
In message <199712222142.NAA27915 at sirius.infonex.com>, you write:
You can load most rifles with the safety on.  We loaded our M-16s on the
line while the weapon was on 'safe' all the time.  The next command was
always, "Rotate your selector switch from 'safe' to 'semi.'  Firers,
watch your lanes... fire at will."  Most safeties are just trigger locks
that prevent you pulling the trigger, they do nothing preventing you
from sticking in a loaded magazine and chambering a round.
