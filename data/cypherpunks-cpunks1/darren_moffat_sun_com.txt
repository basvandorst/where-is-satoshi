@_subject: FileVault on other than home directories on MacOS? 
Note my information may be out of date.  I believe that MacOS native encrypted disk images (and thus FileVault) uses AES in CBC mode without any integrity protection, the Wikipedia article seems to confirm that is  (or at least was) the case There is also a sleep mode issue identified by the NSA:
TrueCrypt on the other hand uses AES in XTS mode so you get confidentiality and integrity.
