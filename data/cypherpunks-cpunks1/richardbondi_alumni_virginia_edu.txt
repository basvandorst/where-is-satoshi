Dear All,
John Wiley & Sons has just published my new book "Cryptography for Visual Basic: A Programmer's Guide to the Microsoft CryptoAPI." Bruce Schneier has kindly endorsed it: "This is essential reading for anyone who needs to understand Microsoft's CryptoAPI,its strengths and its limitations." The book includes open source COM objects with a simple interface to help VB programmers use the CryptoAPI.
For the actual code, links, and other information, see Richard Bondi
