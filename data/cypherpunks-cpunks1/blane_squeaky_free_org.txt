Please keep discussing it here! There's only so much of this other stuff that I can take - my brain needs refreshment.
  How about hiding data in digitized audio? With enough audio the data wouldn't degrade the signal noticably.

is this a DOS only program, or are you distributing source?
  Where can I FTP it from?

They can do this because the FCC has SOLD part of our airwaves to the company. They can do pretty much anything they want to do with it.  The deceptive signals rules apply to Amateurs only. I'm currently studying for my no-code ham license so that I can start playing with on air TCP/IP and my Linux system. Maybe they'll changes the rules if enough 'new' hams could get together. I say 'new' because there are alot of old hams who like things the way they are - they even fought the change in rules that allow no-code users to get a license without having to take morse code(a waste of time in my opinion).

@_subject: CreditCard info 
An interesting sideline -
  I ran into an interesting situation at a local video rental place yesterday. If you give them your credit card number they charge you .25 less a tape to rent it(2.75 compared to 3.00) Your number goes into their customer databse.
  I laughed, and said i'd rather pay the .25 a tape than take the chance of some part-time HS kid getting ahold of my CC number.
  It's unbelieveable (to me anyway) that people would give this kind of information out and trust that it can't be abused. It's bad enough that we're asked to hand out our SS number for everything.

I have also heard this. At school they ask you for your SSN  when signing up for classes, but you can get a random id number assigned instead(I found this out long after giving them my SSN).
  I filled out a credit app at Sears last month that asked for my SSN, I didn't give it and didn't get credit either. What exactly is SS related use? Banks, Employment only?

Yep, you give them the numbers and they still mess it up. My boss's credit report had him with 2 Sears cards, one not his. My friend's credit report showed that he had a lein agains his house(he doesn't own one), a reposses car(not true), garnished(sp?) wages(not true). Pretty sad.
  I guess a nation ID card/number/barcode/embedded microchip would solve this, wouldn't it? I can see us making the progression - in 10 years all newborns will have a small uP implanted into their hand(ala Demolition Man) that will keep track of all their electronic data. Scares the crap out of me.

@_subject: Looking for info on PGP enabling mail apps. . . . 
This depends on your setup. I am running PGPsendmail on my Linux box. This is a wrapper for sendmail/smail that allows automatic encryption to specified recepients, adn per mail encryption and signing through the use of a X-Secure: command line.
  If you are reading your mail on a remote machine you might be able to talk the sysadmin into installing this program, or you might try one of the scripts out there(look at soda.berkeley.edu in    Brian

I would recommend 'The Secret that Exploded' by Howard Morland
  Describes H-Bombs in a language that we can all understand.

It sure was well written. Sounded just like a press release/story. I was starting to get a little pissed until I hit the paragrpah about licenses.
  I suppose that for the next five years the net is going to be overflowing with reposts and requests to call your congressman.

X-Secure: add-key
  I now have my system somewhat kludged into the net. I can now EASILY send and receive PGP messages from my home box. I am connected to my shell account at free.org throught a local xyplex terminal server and term 2.0.4
  I use popclient to get my mail from my host(a better way may be possible), and I have my local smtp service redirected to squeaky.free.org so that I can send mail out without a hassle.
  Anyone who needs help getting set up like this can e-mail me. PGP messages are welcome!
