@_subject: [NTSEC] SKIPJACK / NT4.0 (SP3?) (fwd) 
Since I've had so many people either ask what s/w was installed on this box, or else claim that "J.A. must be on crack! :-)", here is the breakdown...
NT4.0; SP3; Every post SP3 hotfix through the third week of December; NT4.0 Server Resource Kit; I.E. 3.02 with Java VM pkg installed; PGP 5.0 Commercial; Adobe Photoshop 4.0 with a couple of special filter plugins; Adobe Illustrator 4.something, no addons; Adobe Premier with no addons; Micrographics Webtricity; Front Page 97 with assorted HotFixes; Outlook 97 with assorted HotFixes; TCL/TK; J++; Java 1.something with SDK; WordPerfect Suite 7.something.  Obviously, this is on a Web Authoring station, so there is absolutely no reason for any of the above programs to be playing around with Skipjack...  Never the less...  I brought up a testbed system over the Xmas break, using the same install packages that I used to build the workstation in question.  No sign of ANY ciphers: Skipjack or anything else!  Which makes sense.  The question now is just how in the h%@ did it get here in the first place?  And why are my others ciphers explicitly disabled for SSL?  This is a really disturbing finding.  I am more concerned that Skipjack was *silently* installed than anything else: I have plans to completely reinstall all of the software from scratch on this particular box, and then enable full key ACL logging in an attempt to find out how it got there.
I am VERY concerned about this!  The ONLY way I can conceive of this machine having this configuration is if it was silently downloaded to the machine during a W3 session.  And it would NOT likely have been an SSL session: We do absolutely NO on-line transactions here. If Skipjack is being silently, I want to know by whom, and for what purpose.   OK, maybe I'm just paranoid, or smoking crack, but I spent several years in the late '80's working in COMSEC, and the scenario which first comes to mind is not too far-fetched (at least for me) to be believable...
It is most definitely an SSL 3 supported cipher but unless you have the
token or such,
then it is not going to be used for anything, and then only if you try to
connect to a Skipjack (ie. fortezza) site.  I doubt you have the code as it is
classified and available (at this time) only in hardware.  Don't sweat it,
it looks like it's just a hook or .....
What environment/flavor of stuff are you running?
I can help you with this if you want to contact me off the list.

@_subject: Gary Burnore vs. Earth (Was: Value of Annon. Remailers) 
First off, let us state up front that this is an aside to the previous
poster, and not totally on-point: feel free to hit the delete key, and
accept our apologies if this is a problem.
About two months ago, we met the infamous Burnore & Company while defending a semi-annonymous UseNet poster calling himself "Outlaw-Frog-Raper".
It seems that in classical Burnore style "OFR" found himself the sudden
victim of [literally] daily TOS/SPAM complaints by Burnore and Co. for making
use of UseNet to air his decidedly anti-police positions (it's odd how "pro
police" Burnore is, isn't it?).  to Burnore, we too came under attack.  Fortunately, we have been with
our upstream provider for a long time, and are on *very* good terms: they told
Burnore to keep his complaints to himself.  But I digress...
this lunatic *was*, as nobody here is a regular Usenet follower (just when
we have our slow periods, we'll check in with the loons to kill a couple of
hours...).  To our surprise, we discovered that while Burnore/Databasix/etc.
are known far and wide, the actual traffic that passes between them and the rest
of the Earthly population is pretty well eradicated.  Here's a guy who has actually
sat down and deleted (according to DejaNews) *tens of thousands* of his -own- posts!
Not to mention the unknown number of posts which he has "thoughtfully taken care of
for those others who forgot to do so themselves"...
molester (he has even successfully had his North Carolina Sex Offender record
removed!), has almost all come through *some* annonymizer.  Whether a MixMaster,
or Cajones (RIP) "intentional annonymizer", or an "unintentional annonymizer" such as a large [cypherpunks] listserv with "bad headers".
a million such arguments available, to "proof" the value of an annoymous remailer.
we then extend the original Burnore story (presented in part below) in further
Yes, I know, at least half of you are sitting here going "now why did they
bother us with that?".  The answer is we feel VERY strongly that if not for
what [little] we were able to find as a result of A/R's, we would never have
been able to figure this clown out at all.  And loco though he may be, he is
also a *prodigious* pain in the ass, who represents a real, true threat to
what little freedoms we still have in the US.  Burnore isn't a loner in the
political sense: he's actually becoming pretty mainstream.  If A/R's can help
to keep scum like him in the light, where he can't hide his hypocrises [sp?]
through a cancel or "DejaNuke", then they are one of our most important national
resources, and should be defended (and *funded*) as such!
Just our [very biased] $.02 worth...

@_subject: Dorkslayers.. 
We had a run-in with Dorkslayers last night too :(
The first time we brought out our sendmail update, we left it in it's "Virgin state" for approximately
6 hours for monitoring.  During that period we "failed"
a "relay test", and were blacklisted.  As an RBL subscriber,
I was appalled at the difference in attitudes between vix
and dorkslayers.  It is obvious after just a momentary look at the web site that they are out to "have some fun" antagonizing others.  The RBL will mail a notice.  These slimebags don't even
care if you have had an illegal relay: all they care about is finding an  *excuse*  to put you on their list.  Why is
a group "dedicated to saving the InterNet" giving it's biggest prominence (in terms of W3 space) to hate mail recieved from
people that D/S has intentionally wronged?
This group is actually *hurting* the cause significantly.  I was furious enough that I almost left the anti-relay out just
to piss them off.  The problem is, *that's what they really want*.
Getting off is easy, just configure your networks they way *THEY*
want them configured: your clients/customers/employees can all
go to hell as far as Dorkslayers is concerned. VERY POOR.
Perhaps a torrent of mail asking *THEM* to clean up their
act would be a "push in the right direction"?
