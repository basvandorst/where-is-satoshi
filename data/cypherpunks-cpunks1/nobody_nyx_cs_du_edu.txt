@_subject: REMAIL: list 
Here is an interim release of the list, which includes the elee9sf at menudo
and elee6ue at rosebud remailer.  (And you thought I was joking when I said
that some people run remailers that aren't announced :-)
I cleaned up the scripts at elee6ue at rosebud, and in the process of creating
the proper directories for caching (which is NOT implemented just yet) I
zapped the pgp directory and the keyrings... so now there is a new key
for elee6ue at rosebud.ee.uh.edu, keyid = BBC00D.  Sorry about that!
Also, my key klbarrus at owlnet.rice.edu, keyid = 5AD633 has an A.K.A. on
it for elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu.  This is NOT the public key to the remailer,
whose keyid is DC9EE9.
I sign the public keys of remailers I have verified as working, so if you
get the latest pubkeys.tar.gz file from soda or the keys from me, you
will find a signature from 5AD633 on them.
Lastly, thanks to folks who are contributing programs to help other use
the remailers!  I decided to keep my offerings as shell scripts or batch
files, but there is only so much these languages can do, so I welcome
"high" level help programs (source included :-).  Nate's program is
mentioned, but not Alex's (yet) since it isn't available via ftp (yet).
I'll try to keep on top of this stuff.
