@_subject: PGP: pgp -ke 
so, like, what's to stop me from writing a program (based on pgp source
   code) which can delete user IDs from my own keys after other folks have
   signed them?  in fact, how *can* i change the user ID on a key after it
   has been signed?
   the pgp docs are unclear on how this works.  can someone help me to
   understand what it means exactly when a key is signed?  what parts of
   the key are certified by the signature?

<  The simplest effective way I know of to hide an executable (such as

   these are interesting ideas.  but it seems to me you can't beat just using
   a pre-existing popular application for steganography.  in other words, choose
   an algorithm which doesn't require you to create a new program to do the job.

   let me say that some of this discussion has certainly been mind-
   bending, and i appreciate having taken part.  i would like to
   add my 2 pfennigs worth.  anonymity and free speech are different    in precisely this way:
   that we are free to say what we want doesn't mean we aren't also
   accountable for what we may say.  when we can speak freely *and*
   anonymously, then we are no longer accountable for what we say.
   anonymous free speech is a *stronger* form of free speech; this is
   what i think perry is arguing.  however, this stronger form of    freedom means individuals are no longer accountable for their    words or behavior;  this, i believe, is ted's concern.
   i can see that some members of this list are interested in providing
   an environment where these fundamentally social issues are solved    technically.  however, this seems to be an issue which cries out for    a social solution, with perhaps a technical implementation.  they
   may be looking to (over)simplify these social issues so that they are    *easily* solved technically, and this is where they might be going
   astray.
   in our society, for example, there are strong cultural restrictions on
   what we can say.  these are not mandated by law.  these are the rules
   of the game when it comes to existing in a particular culture.  an
   instance of such rules might be "politeness vs. rudeness."
   accountability can have positive or negative affects.  it seems to
   me that the usefulness of anonymous free speech hinges on whether
   the speaker should or should not be held accountable for her/his
   words.  i can't find an easy technical way of making possible free
   speech which is beneficial, but limiting non-beneficial free speech.
   there may be, however, ways of structuring or socially incorporating
   anonymous free speech such that the benefial uses are encouraged, and
   the maleficient uses are reduced.  but i feel strongly that the    approach will have to be socially, not technically based.
   i don't think digital cash is a really equitable way of accomplishing
   this.  as soon as economics are involved, individuals will be sucked
   into classes of "haves" and "have-nots".  while markets are good, the
   effects on individuals can be horrendous, as serious as censorship.     are we trying for meritocracy, or for rule based on who has the most    dough?     accountability is critical to those who can't protect themselves from    the government or from other members of society.  these are precisely
   the people who would be burned by such an economic system.  this *is*
   what the media is for, right?
