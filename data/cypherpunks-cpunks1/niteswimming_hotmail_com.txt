@_subject: Chase-Durer problems 
I saw the ad for Chase Durer watches on your website and just wanted to say that while the watch I have looks good, it has broken three times in the first 7 months of ownership.  Now the company will not even give me a replacement without me paying to ship it to them AGAIN!  Just a waring, they haven't given very good customer service to me.  Buy a Luminox or Brietling instead.  I have both and they are bulletproof.
