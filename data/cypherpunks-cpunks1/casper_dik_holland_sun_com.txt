@_subject: Sun patch pulled 
The wide distribution of the DES enabled libc.so was a mistake, as it
made DES code available world wide.  Now it's no longer even available from
our patchserver in the local office in the Netherlands.
The "Doemstic" libc patch is only required for thsoe sites that have installed
the "U.S. Encryption kit".
If you can't get hold of the patch through official channels, it
*is* possible to take the international version, take the DES modules
from your U.S. Encyption kit and build a new libc.a and libc.so
(the latter utilizing the files form /usr/lib/shlib.etc).
It's a lot more work, but unfortunately Sun can't distribute the
library the easy way.
