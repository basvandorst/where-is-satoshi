It takes more than one or two people to coordinate an international effort.
Once more than a few people know about it, it becomes "company policy" or
"corporate objective", in which case, the NSA/DoS will eventually figure it
out and start levying heavy fines and jailing the individuals.
The main point is that there is no such thing as the "letter of the law".
What they enforce is much broader than that, and how they enforce it is much
more subtle than clear-cut criminal prosecution.  Therefore, you cannot just
use literal loop holes just because it's not clear, because the law they are
enforcing is not clear either.
This response should almost be an FAQ for this crowd.

I think I can answer this question because I was an obnoxious little
hacker with an Atari 800 when I was a kid.  The only thing I did not
have was a modem and an Internet connection (thus ability to read
sci.crypt.research etc ...)
I did have arbitrary precision math libraries (although I did not
have any engineering concept of "libraries"), and I had written some
non-trivial scrambling code (it's not RSA, of course).  I am, by no
means, a super-smart person.  Therefore, it is not a stretch to
believe that kids today can perform powerful encryption in the
privacy of their own homes.
Therefore, to Bill G and his "prophecy": "been there, done that" ...
(Apologies to those who hate that phrase; I hate it too, but it is
so obnoxious that it gets the point across.)

It is definitely legal for private entities to have strict control over
their own resources.  In particular, it is legal for a company to listen
in on their phone conversations for quality control purposes if they
announce this fact ahead of time (you may have heard such a disclaimer
when you call tech support, for instance).
Also, if a student signs such a waiver acknowledging that the situation
at this school is not necessarily that of the "norm" or of potentially
overriding state or federal law, there is a good chance the student has
signed away their right/priviledge of absolute privacy.  Unless there
is serious violation of Constitutional rights or if the contract is
constructed or negotiated in bad faith or in some illegal manner, the
old saying applies:  "a contract is a contract".

It may not be as good of a suggestion as you might think.  If the
number of false positives are so great that there is no reasonable
way for the FBI to go after everyone of them (that is, say, they
could not accurately weigh the likelihood of any particular siting
as having a reasonable chance of being worthy of investigation),
then such a act is worthless.
Also, the FBI, no doubt, has voice analysis systems much more
capable of detecting subtleties.  100,000 enthusiastic people
trying to recognize their friend/relative/co-worker's voice is just
not consistently accurate enough to give the FBI good leads while
avoiding bad ones.
Now, that said, I suppose the FBI could try something like this:
    Have some randomizing automated test which everyone can call
    into to test their hearing abilities before they can tell the
    FBI their possible lead.  Well, I take that back.  May you test
    them AFTER they leave info on their lead so that they don't get
    offended by the testing.
Well ... I guess I'll leave the exercise up to the FBI (to make the
phone-in more user-friendly).
Now what if the FBI had voice detection systems just like the ones
used in "Clear and Present Danger"?  Now THERE'S a good reason for
tapping 1% of every phone switch ...
I wonder if the public would mind having a MACHINE do drift net
matching on voices on all public phone switches in the U.S. just to

machine were made public and the machine placed under Congressional

@_subject: Suggestion for "the serious encryption customers" to end ITAR battle 
I think we can all agree that the level of confidence in software-only
approaches to security is clearly lower than combination software plus
hardware approaches.
It is clear that what is available over the Internet is software.  (It
is much harder to distribute "hardware" as you can only really
distribute design information.  The closest analogy could be a FPGA
program, a Verilog description or some other ASIC net list.)
How about the following as an approach to resolving the dispute over
encryption exports:
1.  Allow arbitrary exports of software-only encryption.
    This means that PGP is exportable as is DES crypt libraries.
2.  Restrict exports of hardware-only or hardware/software encryption.
    This means that smart cards, HP's crypto policy cards, crypto
    processors with tamper-resistant casing, etc ... are restricted.
Why does this make sense?
1.  Reality check on export control of software:
    Software is just too transportable to be restricted, no matter
    WHAT the software does.  Any restriction on WHERE software may be
    or may go is just not feasible, and it's not going to get any
    easier in the foreseeable future.
2.  Take John Deutch at his word:
    Deutch has claimed that "serious users of cryptography" would not
    trust software downloaded over the Internet.  We clearly do not
    agree with him on this aspect, but if he truly believes it (and is
    not just making PR spin statements for the NSA), then he must
    believe that allowing software exports will not significantly
    increase the user base (and therefore, harm CIA's or NSA's
    intelligence capabilities), but it will shut up the software
    companies' complaints.
3.  Give the NSA what it wants:
    Software tends to standardize.  Encryption is only a small part of
    the chain of security measures.  Other weaknesses are surely part
    of the NSA's target for intercepts (no self-respecting
    codebreaking agency should stick to exploiting only one class of
    failures; if it is, we should question the value we are getting
    out of the billions of dollars we blindly give to the NSA).  If
    the NSA stops whining about what is too hard to break, then
    protocol weakness and other non-encryption problems could easily
    creep into standards, and the NSA would surely have an analytical
    advantage over anyone else.
    Since the NSA is happily bragging that it does not even need to
    crack the code to break in, it should be able to live with
    hardware-only export restriction.  The fact that the NSA is no
    longer drawing any lines anywhere for software will leave the bad
    guys guessing as to what it can really decode.
    In addition, hardware manufacturers will probably have a tougher
    overturning export restrictions on hardware-enhanced solutions
    after that because software companies will probably not care.  It
    is clear that the NSA only trusts hardware implementations, as it
    required Clipper to be manufactured in tamper-resistant cases.
All constructive replies welcome.

About 2 years ago, I attended CFP in San Francisco (really San Mateo,

While his alert is not necessarily designed for the audience on this

classic example is usability of PGP.  If PGP is so good for the

even have stream lined courts just for this purpose) for every intercept
needed, then they do not have to worry about capacity or escrowed length
limits, right?
The point is that they ARE exceeding the official count of intercepts,
and they ARE trying to intercept without warrants.  That is why they are
asking for all of this.

Press release:
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION FACT SHEET: U.S. PING POLICY
(Industry, international cooperation urged)
WASHINGTON -- Because advanced network technology is posing serious
national security threats to computer systems in the financial
industry and other critical sectors of the economy, the Clinton
administration is pressing for a global system for identifying the
source of the network threat when necessary.
An July 30 fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Commerce elaborates
the administration approach, called ping recovery escrow.
While the United States sets no limit on the level of number of pings
that networked systems may send within local area networks, it does
restrict exports of ping packets outside LANs.  The administration
says it might relax those export controls if U.S. industry cooperates
on building a ping recovery infrastructure.
Following is the text of the fact sheet:
(begin text)
U.S. Cryptography Policy:  Why We Are Taking the Current Approach
We live in an age of electronic information.  Network technology is
transforming society, creating new businesses, new jobs and new
careers.  The technology also creates new opportunities for network-
enabled systems in critical sectors of the economy such as financial,
military, or government systems.  As a result, these systems are
extremely vulnerable to anonymous security breaches via standard
Internet connections.
The United States is the world leader in networking technology.  U.S.
firms continue to dominate the U.S. and global information systems
market.  Retaining this leadership is important to our economic
security.  The Clinton administration, through its National
Information Infrastructure initiative, has long recognized that
government has an important role as a facilitator and catalyst for
the industry-led transformation of the way we use computer and
communications technology to work and live.
In particular, government has a strong interest in promoting the
legitimate use of robust ping technology to support U.S. international
competitiveness, foster global electronic commerce, prevent computer
crime, and ensure that the information superhighway is a safe place to
conduct one's business.  At the same time, there is a growing
recognition, affirmed most recently by Congressional studies of network
security that computers everywhere are being attacked via the global
We must recognize that the stability and the intregrity of these
critical systems are vital to the national security interests of the
United States.
The importance of the U.S. information technology industry, the security
stakes, and increasing congressional interest make it clear that there
is an urgent need for clear policy and direction.   The administration's
proposed approach is broadly consistent with industry suggestions.  We
believe the right balance must be struck between network technology and
national security.
Effective immediately, the Department of State will transfer its export
control authority over ping technology to the Department of Commerce.
The procedures for one time review by the National Security Agency will
remain in place.  Controls on ping packets exports from local area
networks will be relaxed immediately to certain non-critical sectors of
the Internet, provided that packet lengths longer than 40 bits are
properly escrowed for law enforcement recovery.
We will continue discussions with industry, other members of the private
sector, the Congress,  and governments at all levels to arrive at a
solution that promotes a future of safe networking in a safe society.

-------- INCLUDED MESSAGE
  FCC Asked to Stop Net Phones     A trade association of long distance phone service carriers has asked the Federal Communications Commission to halt companies from selling software and hardware products that enable use of the Internet for long distance voice   In a statement from Washington, the America's Carriers Telecommunication Association says it "submits that it is incumbent upon the FCC to exercise jurisdiction over the use of the Internet for unregulated interstate and international telecommunications services."
  A growing number of companies sell such software with ancillary hardware for transmitting and receiving voice over the Net, which, says the statement, "creates the ability to 'by-pass' local, long distance and international carriers and allows for calls to be made for virtually 'no cost.'"
  "For example," adds the ACTA statement, "online service providers generally charge users around $10 for five hours of access and then around $3 for each additional hour. Five hours equals 300 minutes, divided by $10 is 3.3 cents per minute. The average residential long distance telephone call costs about 22 cents per minute or seven times as much."
  Long-distance and international telephone service carriers must be approved by  the FCC to operate and must file tariffs before both the FCC and state public service commissions. All of these requirements are stipulated in the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
  Says ACTA, "Technology may once again be surpassing government's ability to control its proper use. However, the misuse of the Internet as a way to 'by-pass' the traditional means of obtaining long distance service could result in a significant reduction of the Internet's ability to transport its ever enlarging amount of data traffic."
  Specifically, ACTA petitions the FCC to define the type of permissible communications that may be effected over the Internet.

Europe wants stronger encryption     By Alex Lash
    November 5, 1996, 5:30 a.m. PT     The European Electronic Messaging Association has told
    the European Commission that European companies are at a
    competitive disadvantage without access to strong
    American-made cryptography, according to the
    organization.     ....

IDEA is patented in Europe.  It takes a lot of time to test out and
"break in" new encryption algorithms.  If you invent one, surely the
first thing you would want to do is to patent it, right?  Well, that
is exactly what everyone's been doing so far.  Few, if any, actually
let their stuff go to the public domain.
Kudos to Bruce S for Blowfish ...

@_subject: Free software could not threaten purpose of ITAR ... 
It never ceases to amaze me how inconsistent the anti-crypto
people are on this issue ...
I just took a look at VADM McConnell's answers during a Senate
hearing on May 3, 1994 ...
    Questions from Senator Murray:
    Q: In my office in the Hart building this February, I downloaded
    from the Internet an Austrian program that uses DES encryption.
    This was on a laptop computer, using a modem over a phone line.
    The Software Publishers' Association says there are at least 120
    DES or comparable programs world wide.  However, U.S. export
    control laws prohibit American exporters from selling comparable
    DES programs abroad.
    With at least 20 million people hooked up to the Internet, how do
    U.S. export controls actually prevent criminals, terrorists, or
    whoever from obtaining DES encryption software?
    A: Serious users of encryption do not entrust their security to
    software distributed via networks o bulletin boards.  There is
    simply too much risk that viruses, Trojan Horses, programming
    errors, and other security flaws may exist in such software which
    could not be detected by the user.  Serious users of encryption,
    those who depend on encryption to protect valuable data and cannot
    afford to take such chances, instead turn to other sources in
    which they can have greater confidence.  Such serious users
    include not only entitles which may threaten U.S. national
    security interests, but also businesses and other major consumers
    of encryption products.  Encryption software distribution via
    Internet, bulletin board, or modem does not undermine the
    effectiveness of encryption export controls.
Why is it, then, that we don't just allow non-commercial software to
be exported?
1.  I don't believe, for a moment that "serious users" of cryptography
    cannot entrust their security to "software distributed via
    networks o bulletin boards".  Those are precisely the mediums
    through which PGP became popular.
2.  Phil Z was being harassed precisely because PGP is most definitely
    a serious threat in the trend toward undermining ITAR.
3.  Phil K's export request was rejected, and MIT was harassed over
    the PGP source book, precisely because source code is source code.
    It does not matter if it came on a disk or through a network or
    through a bulletin board or on a book.
The point is that the NSA DOES view this as a serious threat, so they
are fighting this tooth and nail.

It seems that there are many technical means to stop abuse from
the resource usage sense:
1.  Prevent non-members from sending mail to the list.  (This may
    be done already, but since I don't know, I cannot say.)
2.  Limit the rate of new subscription requests (perhaps on a per-
    host or per-domain basis.)
3.  Re-order out-going mail (from toad.com) according to size.
    Drop messages from queue if it gets "reordered" too many times.
4.  Truncating long messages.
5.  Re-order out-going mail (from toad.com) according to time of
    last mail (from the originator).  Basically, limit the rate of
    mail from any particular person or host or domain.
6.  Refuse connections from "known host(s) or domain(s) of
    abusers" during "busy" periods.
These are not whole-sale censorship mechanisms, but just abuse-
resistence measures.

I must commend Robin for a well-said comment.
It is truly counter-productive to insist on conspiracy theories and
anti-government rhetoric.  Sure, there have been conspiracies in the
past.  Sure, there have been more than our fair share of atrocities.
However, the real issues are privacy, security, freedom of speech, and
effective policy enforcement.  When we start calling names like "jack
booted thugs" and the like, we are sinking to the same low levels that
Freeh and (more appropriately) Gorelick use when they cry wolf and
foretell futuristic electronic meltdowns.
More importantly, while the public is cynical and skeptical, it isn't
exactly embracing the right-wing militia movements either.  It would
be a great disservice to the cause if cypherpunks were, in the minds
of the public, tightly associated with the likes of Timothy McVey.

McNeil & Lehear (sp?)  (ok, I know, one of them is gone, but I forgot

@_subject: Hurray! A good example of rational thinking ... 
I do believe we need to get more visibility on the seriousness of the
issues.  I don't think the average person understands why it was so
hard to conspire against the people before the telecommunications age,
and why it "could" (not necessarily "would") be now.
There is a lot of knowledge to pass on before someone can truly
appreciate the extent of the need for privacy and freedom protections.
While it is bad that the extent of the body of knowledge turns off
most people's willingness to learn, the sheer vastness of the task of
setting up this infrastructure also makes it very difficult for the
NSA or any other agency to become the secret puppet master.
Not that they have not been trying.
But to accuse them of necessarily harboring evil purposes is not only
counter-productive, but most probably incorrect.  Most public sector
servants are not the New World Order loonies that the militia's have
been prepared to fight.  It would be safe to say that the NSA, the CIA
and the FBI are filled with mostly red-blooded Americans with solid
allegiance to the basic principles which you and I cherish.
The questions is, why have 3 branches of government?  Why have
multiple conflicting agencies for any given task or goal?  Why not
just choose a "good guy" once and for all and let him (or her) do the
"right thing"?  It's not that we don't trust him when we first elect
him.  It's a question of what he would do with that power?  And those
that succeed him?
That is why we don't "just trust them".
It's too bad that we can't hold Reagan responsible for Iran-Contra
just because he's presiding over the executive branch at the time.
After all, we expect him to be responsible (whether he knew about it
or not).  Why not drop all these stupid laws that PREVENT the citizens
from suing the government for incompetence?
I seriously doubt you "long" for the King George days.  If you do,
well, we are just not in the same universe.
Have you ever consider the possibility that maybe ... just maybe ...
the government really IS as incompetent as it is reputed to be?
Consider this ...
If you were a know-nothing beaurocrat, how would you run a large
institution?  Top-down?  Probably.  Gather as much info as you can?
Of course.  Require that everyone trust your judgement (a la
"executive priviledge")?  Naturally.  If there were guaranteed
political opposition, no matter what you do, would you just push
for more power/priviledge/money in everything you do?  Damn right!
Especially if you don't know how many of these things you push for
will be won ...
Oh, and there is this minor problem with some of these methods
clashing with the Constitution ...  Oh bother!
I'm simply saying that it natural for the branch of the government
primarily responsible for law enforcement and national security to
care deeply about that side of any issue.  If I were president, I
would play the same political games Clinton is playing.  A president
is not just responsible for the specific free speech of programmers or
specific privacy rights of individuals.  He is responsible for a much
bigger picture.  It just so happens that, in our nation, we value
"individual" liberty much more than anything else (including anybody
else's "big picture").  Therefore, there are a lot of people against
the more obvious methods of invasion of privacy.  But let's face it,
the public just isn't very informed or consistent on the topic; it is
just easily swept up in hysteria.
You were born to your mother and father, who are members of a society
which has long built up imperfect infrastructures for surviving and
thriving on the land which it depends.  If you were alone in the vast
American plains, you can claim you have infinite rights, and no one
would disagree with you.  You, your mother, your father, make
trade-offs everyday on your purest rights versus your practical
rights.  Your purest rights are mostly given lip service, and then
where it matters more, protected by gentlemen's agreements, sometimes
backed by force.  But the right itself is not enforced by any real
means.  It is the threat of punishment that keeps the right from being
Cryptography is one of those interesting areas where, for once, man
can prove, for all practical purposes, that there is a hard limit
somewhere that he can draw.  More importantly, it is also genuine
protection of a "right", specifically, a right to privacy, which
society previously protected using the old methods (threat of
Imagine a line in the sand ... if you cross it, someone shoots you in
the leg.  You can still cross it, but you'll suffer the consequences.
With cryptography, you cannot cross it, no matter what you do.  This
brings into question whether or not it was useful (to you and to
society) to shoot you MOST of the time, but not if you present a good
reason to cross it first.
THIS is the interesting part of all of this.  I don't like to see this
issue drowned out by all the conspiracy talk (which no one on this
list is in any position of proving or fixing unilaterally).

Commerce Department Urges
Easing of Encryption Controls
By Bloomberg Business News
WASHINGTON - The Commerce Department will recommend easing export
controls on encryption software after a study by the department and
the National Security Agency found that American companies are being
hurt, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said last week.
Such a move may pit Mr. Brown against the military and intelligence
agencies, setting the stage for a White House battle over one of the
last computer technologies still covered by export controls.
"I'm interested in promoting American exports," Mr. Brown said in an
interview on Friday. "If your foreign competitors are exporting
products with encryption capability and you are not, that puts you at
a tremendous competitive disadvantage."
The Government bans United States companies from exporting encryption
software - hard-to-break computer codes that turn information, like
files and credit card numbers, into indecipherable material that can
be sent across computer networks without fear of tampering.
The United States justifies the export restrictions by saying
law-enforcement agencies would be hamstrung in their efforts to stop
terrorists or spies from using encryption to send information

@_subject: Clipper III on the table 
I don't think it's a matter of being fooled.
IBM and HP have very large federal systems divisions.  They are also
fighting for more (and hold on to current) financial sector customers.
The government currently has a huge strangle hold on that market in
terms of regulatory agencies/policies that will not be loosened very
easily (assuming one believes that it should be loosened, which I do
not necessarily agree with).
Therefore, it is definitely in IBM's and HP's interest to build
systems that the government likes.  It is also important for them to
point out that such systems are very vulnerable given the previous
policies.  This new GAK ("GAKR"??) will actually be quite appropriate
in terms of a right "balance" for the financial sector.  In fact, I
would expect the financial sector to have to open its transactions to
not just the FBI/CIA/DEA, but the SEC and other non-law-enforcement
The question is:  Why is this GAKR appropriate for the rest of us?
Why do we want it?
It really does harm the "small" companies like Netscape because they
don't have as much resources to establish the infrastructure
necessary for GAKR, and their target markets are not in bed with the
local governments.  Instead, their target markets are anyone who
wants to buy, and no one, when it comes to their personal privacy
would want to buy something to which the U.S. government has a
guaranteed backdoor.
I predict, therefore, Netscape and RSA would NOT capitulate to this
latest bitter carrot.

@_subject: Lack of reporting on CALEA and Encryption issues ... 
I must first say that your program is one of the finest in news
reporting, and I tune in every day.
However, nothing is perfect, and your program is no exception:
I am very concerned by the lack of reporting on CALEA (the US $500
Million Digital Telephony bill) and the continuing maneuvering by the
Clinton administration on the encryption issue.
Two years ago, FBI Director Louis Freeh managed to slip a $500 Million
wire tap bill into the Congressional budget using last-minute sneaks.
(He and his predecessors had tried unsuccessfully for several years to
do it in the full light of open democracy, so this was the only way
they could force it down American's throats.)  After seeing this pass,
many Congress members refused to fund it because the FBI continued to
violate terms of CALEA which required full accounting to Congress of
how the wire tap capacities were to be designed and used.  When the
figures were finally published, the public balked.  Not surprisingly,
Freeh had to resort to the same last-minute maneuvers to sneak in
funding for CALEA this year.
If the news media had reported either incident (or both), I would
probably not be so upset, but the news media completely ignored this
horrible abuse of the democratic process.
The same goes for the encryption issue.  It is clear that all present
and past administrations have sided strongly with law enforcement and
national security agencies, and have refused to allow for the
proliferation of strong encryption despite the fact that it is
probably the single biggest technical obstacle to Internet commerce
and personal privacy.
Again I would not be so upset if they let the issue be decided in the
full light of democracy rather than behind closed doors using the "if
you only knew what we knew, you would agree with us" argument.  This
sentiment is precisely echoed by the Congressional study done by the
NRC on national cryptographic policy.  The Clinton administration was
hoping that the two year study would buy time and would eventually
agree with its opinion, and when it did not, the Clinton
administration dismissed it as uninformed, despite the fact that most
of the NRC panel did get the infamous "secret briefing" by the NSA.
Basically, they are not open to reason on this issue; they are open to
one and only one idea: that law enforcement and national security
agencies having guaranteed access to information when they want it,
and they don't care about the technical or the privacy implications.
Oh .. and by the way, they want access to all information, not just
that which crosses national borders.
The significance of these two issues are difficult to summarize in a
sound bite.  The best I can think of is to watch the Tom Clancy movie
"Clear and Present Danger".  While watching this movie, note how the
CIA finds the telephone conversations of the drug dealer's agent.
That sort of capability is called "drift net fishing" (for obvious
"drift net fishing" was not possible in the old days of wire taps
because the phone company barely kept enough written logs to find the
cables and the wires, let alone figure out exactly where they go.  The
problem is especially difficult in older/larger cities where phone
company technicians often tap a wire (for normal services) wherever it
works.  By the FBI's estimates, each physical wire tap costs on the
order of $50K.  Basically, the huge cost barrier (in man power) kept
the government's powers in check.
Enter the digital and wireless age, and suddenly every signal from
every phone, beeper, computer and other neato gadgets are sent all
over the place.  True, it has become more difficult to figure out
where a signal is routed, and that is what the FBI complained about.
On the other hand, it has become infinitely easier to intercept
communications without detection because every transmission is just a
perfect verbatim copy of the original.
Suddenly, the cost of monitoring a phone is not so high.  If the
routing capability is there, the FBI agents can sit in their
comfortable offices and press the right buttons, and the contents of
the call is duplicated at their desks.  Of course, they don't have to
have real people monitoring such calls; they can have voice analysis
computers do it.  They can search for anything that sounds like "bomb"
or "kill" or "shoot" or "blow up".
In the Clancy movie, such "drift net fishing" capability is clearly
being used for good purposes, and I certainly applaud that.  I hope
that all of the leading edge technologies used by our law enforcement
and national security agencies are used for good purposes.
But that is not what history tells us.  History tells us that such
technologies are oblivious to the morals and ethics of their masters.
Even in the older days of wire tapping techniques, the FBI was able to
illegally intercept communications of civil rights leaders and other
"dangerous" elements of society.  Therefore, to grant the government
capabilities that would enable "drift net fishing" on our own citizens
is setting a very dangerous precedence.  What if the FBI decides to
search for "democratic" or "republican" or "pro-choice" or "pro-life"?
What if they search for "muslim" or "jewish" or "christian"?
These are the real dangers of CALEA and encryption restrictions.  The
boogie men that will plan bomb attacks and kidnap children have always
found a way to do it, and some have gotten away, without any help from
encryption or secure telephones.
If the law enforcement and national security agencies truly want to
save lives and promote public safety, there are many other issues and
problems to deal with, and they are wasting valuable time with these
two issues; other the other hand, if they just care about keeping and
enhancing their abilities to be omniscient, then their current
behavior is quite consistent with that goal:
1.  Lies and misrepresentations:
    a.  Louis Freeh now claims that CALEA will cost $2 billion.
    b.  The CALEA slush fund Freeh got passed at the last minute of
        this Congress is actually unlimited.
    c.  Despite their promises of full reporting, they have actually
        succeeded in defeating all the reporting clauses in CALEA,
        again, thanks to this last minute sneak.
    d.  Clinton, Gore and company have consistently denied that they
        intend to restrict domestic encryption.  However, if you
        listen to Gorelick, Freeh, Reno, Crowell and others, you will
        find out that they absolutely against domestic encryption.
2.  Beaurocratic maneuvering:
    a.  Spent 3 years "investigating" Phil Zimmerman and then dropped
        without comment.
    b.  Used every trick in the book to keep ITAR encryption rules
        from ever being directly considered for Constitutionality.
        (NSA internal counsel believes it will not withstand such a
        legal challenge.)
    c.  Refused to clearly define what is exportable and what is not.
        (Keep it confusing so that most will stay away just to be
        safe.)  Also refused to clearly define what is "export",
        given that encryption is just algorithms and information in
        the purest form.
I appeal to you, as a respected news organization, to investigate this
in detail and expose the facts and let the public decide.
Thank you.

It seems that the best method for fighting GAK is to accelerate
wide-spread domestic use of freely redistributable non-GAK crypto.
The Lynux automatic firewall concept that John Gilmore is pushing is a
great idea, but it is still brewing, and he's shooting for developing
an exportable ... er ... importable version.  That will take much time
to develop, and time is what we don't have much of.
We need to work on applications, API's, flexible software modules, etc.
and the primary reason we cannot do it so easily is because we cannot
redistribute the software so easily.
First thing we definitely need is a way to determine with fairly good
accuracy, whether a host is in the U.S.  This MUST be an automagic
mechanism ...  no person involved so there is little delay in getting
the goodies.  The best implementation would automatically set the
group of an incoming anonymous FTP session daemon to a special group
if there is a high degree of certainty that the originating host is
within the U.S.
Second thing we definitely need is a convenient way and universal way
to clearly notify the recipient of the current export restrictions of
such software, so that the recipient knows what he/she is in for.
Basically, we have to do our best to NOT violate the law, no matter
how much we hate it.  What the government wants to happen is that
everyone will get hooked on GAK, and it will be too inconvenient to
use something else.  A good counter-strategy is to get everyone hooked
on the good stuff.
Right now, the FBI/NSA is looking for an excuse to prosecute anyone
not jumping on their bandwagon.  We have to avoid give them an excuse
to prosecute us while still enabling rapid application development.
Communication and distribution are key.

@_subject: The Myth of the "Balanced" Middle Ground (Was: Re: gack vs. key recovery) 
Actually, the government encourages this view by lying.  We can get
into the many examples on encryption and wire taps, but if the TLAs
keep using lies and PR instead of honesty and facts, then no one
will accept anything they propose as-is.  There will always be some
suspicion of hidden agendas.
And really, the agenda is obvious, but they have always refused to
acknowledge the full extent of it, probably because it would forever
damage their credibility.  At least right now, Freeh has done enough
PR (paid by your generous tax dollars) to make him look like a good
guy.  Janet Reno already looks innocent enough (hey, who could
criticize someone who might look like your grandmother?) ...  The PR
concepts are all there, deliberately or accidentally.
Let them buy it.  There are companies already making products with
key recovery.  But remember that key recovery are mostly useful to
corporations, so it will be billed as the "professional" version (in
off-the-shelf PC-class software) and also be pushed through the IS
consulting channels.
None of that really addresses E-Mail, I-phone, etc for the rest of us.
I agree that there is a legitimate interest by legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests.  But ...
1.  If it's so darn easy to get non-GAK encryption, why dumb it down
    for the rest of us?  (Really, I just don't buy the "no plans for
    domestic regulations" bit.  Plenty of current and ex-executive
    branchies have admitted as much in private.)
2.  The Orwellian possibilities are definitely there.  I simply will
    not let the government have drift-net-fishing rights on the NII.
    Sorry.  I'll let them tap one-sie two-sie's, and I want the
    process to guarantee by functional design (not legal constraints)
    that it's expensive to tap more than a few at a time.
That was true because it was too darn expensive.  Hey, at $50K per
tap, I would be really selective about spending my hard-lobbied wire
tap budget.  If I can just push a button, I will be far less
selective. (oh ... and make sure I ask real nicely later in front of
the judge ... maybe ... if I have time ... too busy catching
terrorists and child molesters, y'know)
I'm not as worried about the indiscriminant tapping ordered by "good"
FBI directors; I'm worried about the tapping by the bad ones.  There
is ZERO detectability if the FBI gets everything they want.  There is
not a chance of being accidentally discovered by a phone company
employee or a wandering by-stander.
That lack of check-and-balance is what I am completely against.  I
don't mind letting them have the technology if I can be sure it will
1) work and 2) minimize abuse.
Ok.  So every corporation (big and small) now must have a Chief
Law Enforcement Relations Officer (CLERO) if they build encryption
into their products?  Every software engineering consultant has to
jump through hoops to export their product?
Sorry.  If the software engineering industry were just big mammoth
corporations, I wouldn't care.  But it could just be me and my
home office.  I cannot afford to fly to D.C. to amuse some panel at
the D.o.C. with my stupid key-recovery tricks.  No.  This plan
completely discriminates against small players, and there are a lot
of them.
Finally, writing software is an art.  It is not purely art, but it
certainly is an art, which I believe falls fully under free
expression and the First Amendment.  The work of art is not
functional until someone compiles it and run it on a machine.  So
regulating anything before the actual execution is definitely a
violation of the First Amendment.
I don't have time to deal with privacy but as soon as it starts
executing, it becomes an instrument of privacy so regulating that
is also against my basic beliefs, not to mention my engineering
sense of practicality.
Good point.  If we are not careful, we could get bad PR.  But then,
I've been trying to argue that use of words like "anarchy" is against
good PR principles anyway.  I don't think cypherpunks have such
pristine reputations that we must tread carefully for fear of
damaging our "reputation".
In fact, I don't think we even have one.  That is, in some ways,
worse than having one at all.
I think you are making the obvious mistake that many people make
about similar groups, such as Libertarians.  When someone says you
should be able to freely choose, that is all that they are saying.
They are not saying that someone else may not make a system that is
not ideal, but does provide many other value-added benefits.

@_subject: Clinton's Encryption Plan Fits Law and Market 
Two serious flaws in this letter ...
1.  Secretary of Commerce, Mickey Kantor said:
A.  This is an old argument constantly rehashed by the government.
    What it convenient ignores is that no one OUTSIDE the government
    wants what the government schemes.  No one wants the government to
    mandate key recovery.  Some important uses of encryption, such as
    secure telephone conversations, simply do NOT need key recovery for
    ANY reason other than law enforcement intercepts.
B.  The point on other nations barring imports is absurd.  Since WHEN do
    we tailor our export limits to the import limits of OTHER nations?
C.  The so-called "trend" he refers to is ARTIFICIALLY created by the
    U.S. government through secret lobbying efforts, the most recent at
    the OECD in Paris.  The administration uses the word "trend" as if
    other nations are independently pursuing the key-escrow/key-recovery
    path, when in fact, only a few nations are considering such a move.
    Other nations, such as Japan, have openly opposed such a direction,
    and some nations, such as Sweden, have done so secretly because such
    a policy could not possibliy withstand the scrutiny of democratic
    processes.
2.  Kantor said:
Again, more mincing of words.  The administration, seeing that the NRC
report was staunchly against key escrow and government-mandated schemes,
chooses to ignore parts of the report it feels is convenient.
The NRC report, in fact, said that the government should immediately
relax all symmetric encryption up to 56-bits and all public domain
encryption UNCONDITIONALLY.  It did not say anything about signing a
pledge to develope key escrow or key recovery.  This condition invented
by the administration is nothing short of blackmail:  "play it our way,
or you have no chance to compete globally".
In short, Kantor's letter is yet more blatant lies and deception on the
part of the administration to get what it wants for law enforcement and
national security agencies without any concern for the nature of the technology nor the economic impact such policies will have.

 Required reading
 By Loring Wirbel
 What was I thinking? It's been more than six months since I wasted
 column space with a good intelligence community rant. It's not as
 though nothing much has been happening. The New York Times and other
 media outlets have laid out the Cellular Telephone Industry
 Association's significant complaints against the Digital Telephony
 Act, portions of which will allow the FBI and National Security Agency
 to determine location of roaming telephone or IP addresses in a
 network. And we here at EE Times have been filling you in on the NSA's
 questionable involvement in an Internet backbone program called
 Project Monet.
 Truth be told, it's hard to keep sending up warning flares about the
 vast expansion of intelligence agencies' reach in an election year as
 hopeless as this one. President Clinton, of course, called for
 "wiretaps, many more wiretaps" during his acceptance speech at the
 Democratic Convention, and tried to sneak in a quadrupling of the
 Digital Telephony Act tapping slush fund during the waning days of
 Congress's budget negotiations. Everyone from Wired to The Progressive
 is now suggesting that President Nixon actually was more liberal than
 Clinton along the civil-liberties axis.
 And Bob Dole? The Republican Party quashed the efforts by budget hawks
 like John Kasich to carefully analyze NSA and National Reconnaissance
 Office budgets. The Repub gospel now is to give the Defense Department
 everything it asks for, and then some.
 Cryptography buffs have been waiting for relief in the form of the
 third edition of James Bamford's classic The Puzzle Palace, on the
 workings of the NSA. The new edition is supposed to contain material
 from co-author Wayne Madsen detailing NSA presence at Internet
 switching centers, and cipherpunks have been disappointed that the
 book didn't meet its June release date. Rumor has it that squabbles
 between the two authors and the publisher may push the book out well
 into 1997.
 But fear not, if you're willing to go chasing afar for good fireside
 reading! Researcher Nicky Hager in New Zealand has just published an
 amazing tome, Secret Power, that might do more damage to the NSA than
 Bamford's work. Hager is a bold activist, working with producers of
 the New Zealand version of "20/20" to go inside the secret signals
 base at Waihopai and take unprecedented video footage of the inside of
 the radomes, which are alleged to spy on international civilian
 Intelsat traffic.
 Hager isn't just a crank, however. His work on New Zealand's
 Government Communications Security Bureau is incredibly
 well-researched. Respected defense analyst Jeff Richelson wrote the
 foreword and British journalist Duncan Campbell claims in the Observer
 that the book has created quite a stir inside NSA headquarters. The
 most damning information details a global computer network, run by NSA
 on behalf of all the U.K./U.S. Treaty allies, called the Echelon/
 Dictionary network. Echelon allows NSA to snare traffic intercepted by
 any ally into a unified database, without the ally having the
 slightest idea of what NSA is taking. And Hager is certain that
 civilian telex and Internet traffic is a prime target of the system.
 Don't look for a U.S. distributor for Secret Power-everyone here is
 afraid to touch it. His publisher doesn't even list a phone or
 e-mail. But if we all write to Craig Potton Publishers, Box 555,
 Nelson, New Zealand, perhaps we can free up enough copies of the book
 to scare the U.S.  signal-intelligence community into having a minimum
 modicum of respect for civil liberties. But then again, I doubt it.

    CODE LIMIT EXCEEDED
    By Jack Robertson
    Washington - New Internet-television systems from Sony Corp. and
    Philips Electronics Co. are technically munitions under U.S. export
    controls and cannot be shipped to the companies' worldwide sales
    networks, it was disclosed last week.
    Sony officials said the company's TV set-top box designed by WebTV of
    Palo Alto, Calif., includes a state-of-the-art 128-bit code encryption
    system for electronic commerce. This far exceeds the 40-bit encryption
    code permissible for export under the U.S. Munitions Control List.
    Philips also makes a WebTV set-top Internet box at its Magnavox TV
    plant in Knoxville, Tenn., and is similarly barred from shipping the
    unit to sales channels around the world.
    Both global electronic giants face immediate competition in the
    emerging TV-Internet surfing market from other Japanese, South Korean,
    and European set-makers that don't face the U.S. encryption
    controls. They now join the U.S. computer industry, which has long
    protested that the outmoded encryption export curbs are causing them
    to forfeit overseas sales of PCs and workstations to foreign rivals.
    President Clinton last month proposed lifting the level of encryption
    export controls from the present 40-bit code word to 56 bits, but only
    if a trap door is embedded in the cipher to allow law enforcement
    agencies to decode wiretapped messages. Clinton is expected shortly to
    sign an executive order putting the new control limits into effect.
    The pending 56-bit-code threshold doesn't help the Sony or Philips
    Web-surfing TV systems - nor most U.S. computer companies that build
    systems with encryption exceeding even the new control limit. Both
    Netscape and Microsoft Web-browsing software includes 128-bit code
    encryption, surpassing export curbs.
    Zenith Electronics Co., maker of a Web-surfing TV set, isn't concerned
    about the encryption controls, since it sells only in the U.S. market
    where the curbs don't apply.
    Divicom Inc., based in Milpitas, Calif., must get an export license
    from the U.S. State Department for every exported cable TV front-end
    encoder, which includes 128-bit code word, according to Tom
    Lookabough, the company's sales manager. He said the license review
    process can take eight weeks or more, a troublesome delay that foreign
    competitors don't face.
    Divicom and Scientific Atlanta both said their new digital TV set-top
    boxes include encryption that exceeds allowable export limits - but
    virtually all sales so far are in the U.S. market. As digital-box
    production ramps up, the companies would like to sell overseas, but
    run into the export control ban that puts them at a severe
    disadvantage against the foreign competitors aggressively entering the
    set-top market.
    President Clinton's encryption export control changes include an
    industry-favored provision to take the category off the State
    Department's Munitions Control List and shift responsibility to the
    Commerce Department.

    TIA TO ISSUE DRAFT WIRETAP SPECS
    By Peter Cassidy
    The Telecommunications Industries Association next month will issue
    draft standards allowing manufacturers to make equipment that complies
    with the most recent federal wiretapping law.
    If and when those draft standards are ultimately approved, however,
    equipment makers will still face a troubling dilemma: The U.S. Justice
    Department, which in large part wrote the new law, is also the agency
    that will enforce it.
    President Clinton signed the Communications Assistance for Law
    Enforcement Act in October 1994 after a last-ditch, sub-rosa lobbying
    effort by the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of
    Investigation pushed the bill through a Senate committee.
    In essence, the law says that the U.S. Attorney General will dictate
    how the law will carry out its job of tapping into switches.
    As of October 1998, manufacturers will have to build their switches to
    meet the industry specs, and carriers will have to maintain the
    switches accordingly.
    Switches in place before Jan. 1, 1995, are nominally exempted from
    compliance. Modifications intended to fulfill the capabilities the
    Justice Department mandates will be required only if companies are
    reimbursed for the changes-the exception being equipment that has been
    "substantially" modified.
    Despite these protections, concern persists: Because many of the
    technical features in place before the January 1995 cutoff will have
    been updated in some way, conflicts with the Justice Department may
    ensue over whether to consider them "pre-existing" technologies under
    the law.
    And companies on the losing end will suffer major penalties: The law
    specifies that the FBI can define which companies are not in
    compliance and bring civil actions against them, with fines of up to
    $10,000 per violation.
    Accordingly, the ambiguity in the legislative language could end up as
    costly both for modifications that are not reimbursed and for court
    challenges.
    "What is not really addressed is what 'a significant upgrade' really
    means," said Dan Bart, standards and technology vice president at the
    TIA. "Ultimately, some test case will come and some judge will make
    the final decision."
    Given the relationship between the industry and Justice over
    wiretapping capability thus far, a court challenge hardly seems
    far-fetched. In fact the act was proposed only after the FBI and
    telecom industry groups wrangled for years in consultative
    committees. The FBI had argued that advanced telephony technologies
    were making it difficult to wiretap and capture call data. Finally,
    the agency turned to a legislative solution.
    The TIA's draft standards, due to be issued next month by the group's
    TR 45.2 committee, will contain the technical specifications required
    to build-in the features for the Electronic Surveillance Interface
    that the act defines.
    Following a comment period of up to 90 days, the standards will be
    placed on a ballot for a vote by committee members, said committee
    chairwoman Cheryl Blum. If substantial changes are made to the draft
    during the comment period, the standards may have to go back to the
    committee, she noted.
    Cellular data removed
    At a standards meeting last month, the committee removed language that
    would have defined a standard for forwarding the location data of
    cellular phones when the instrument is powered up-but not actively
    transmitting and receiving-information the FBI indicated it should
    have if available.
    Ms. Blum said the committee decided such a capability exceeds the
    requirements of the the act. This point is important because, under
    the law, companies are reimbursed only for those modifications of
    existing technologies expressly spelled out in the act.
    Clearly, the FBI holds the whip, even in this standards-making
    process. Should the standards be found deficient under the law, the
    FCC can step in and replace those standards with its own.
    Justice is the most visible proponent, but the act is also of great
    interest to the NSA, which introduces a potentially troubling level of
    complexity as the industry attempts to comply with the law.
    Commerce Department memos obtained by Telepath show that the NSA was
    involved in sculpting the language of the act as far back as 1992.
    A Senate committee staff attorney, now in private industry, told
    Telepath that the NSA's interest was that the act introduce the
    opportunity to build wiretap access points into switches outside the
    United States.
    Equipment built to specifications in this country-and by offshore
    manufacturers for the U.S.  market-would thus find its way into
    foreign telephone networks, allowing the NSA a simpler means to tap
    into targeted subjects.
    What liabilities this introduces to equipment makers remains unclear,
    as these are the early days of the act-the first law to give the
    government the power to demand design changes in telephony
    technologies.

This, of course, is not any indication that we should not stay

their monopoly on intelligence gathering.  They clearly have a
strong interest in hamstringing every single challenge to the

Here is where I don't agree on the merits ...
1.  Pro-censorship agendas does not need much legislative momentum
because it does not take much P.R. on a child-molestation-murder
incident on some little caucasian girl from a motherhood-and-apple-pie
Small Town, U.S.A. to drum up the sentiments to censor.
2.  Anti-encryption has been well guarded by the NSA/CIA/FBI/DoD for a
long time using the semi-legitimate veil of national security.  In
fact, in some senses, there ARE legislative support, even if
unconstitutional when evaluated in the bright light of day.  The
problem is that you'll fight for years JUST TO GET A CHANCE to
evaluate the law itself.
Yes, some of the current legal battles are on their way there, but
it's been a LONG time, and every decision/every appeal takes months to
years, and it's clear that the NSA is hoping that in 2 years, they can
sign up enough pro-key-recovery companies to make the legal battles
moot.  2 years is pretty short compared to the time scales on these
battles, and the NSA is counting on just that.
To me, the time-to-market is just as important as the purity of the
products (the proposed legislations).
I don't think anyone will be willing to genuinely export encryption
(in a real commercial product) while directly flaunting the NSA's
implicit/explicit authority on this matter.  Corporations are too
concerned with the short term bottom line to care about more long term
goals like have freedom to export anything it wants.  I already know
of several instances at various companies where designs were
deliberately altered to NOT give the appearance of designing a product
with specific encryption/decryption capabilities, even though that is
what the product must support, fundamentally speaking.  Therefore, I
must conclude that the NSA is definitely winning some battles on their
2 year schedule already.
I really don't think we are disagreeing here.  I would not support any
restrictions on domestic usage, nor would I support any restrictions
on what non-governmental institutions may use.  I still believe we
should push for all we can get because that is the way the
legistlative process works, and that is the game the other side is
playing.  However, we shouldn't place unrealistic constraints on our
supporting legislators such as taking an "all or nothing" attitude.
Even if all we can get is 56-bit or 64-bit export legalization, it is
a HUGE chip away from the NSA rock because their "2 years free for key
recovery" plan is just that much weaker.  I would rather see, of
course, 128-bit/168-bit be liberalized, because that would essentially
mean that everything is liberalized, because the NSA has been playing
this "56-bit is too strong" charade, and losing 128-bit/168-bit is
essentially losing their argument, unless they want to risk coming to
the security committees admitting that they have lied.
Well, we're not talking about the realities of the massive
semi-underground activities.  We're talking about the U.S. Government,
(which often has poor notions/understandings of reality), corporations
(which often must obide by the laws and regulations, however poor,
crafted by the U.S. Gov.), and genuine consumer applications (which
are significantly driven by the products produced by these
Of course, I don't like any of them, especially if there are still
secret committees with very real control written into the legislation.
If the NSA/FBI can call up Robert Allen to stall a secure phone
product line, they already have enough power outside the legal process
that they don't need any real committees to help them out.  However,
NSA will clearly deny having this level of influence to the security
committees, and they will most likely accept the NSA's word.

@_subject: Export Tax vs ITAR as a compromise ... 
How about this as a political compromise ...
1.  Allow any export of crypto.
2.  Tax crypto exports heavily, say 25% or something
    like that, unless key recovery (or some other
    GAK-ish feature) is part of the product.  For
    instance, structuring the taxes so that ...
        GAK-only     products get taxed   0%
        GAK-optional products get taxed  20%
        non-GAK      products get taxed  25%
3.  Give this revenue upside to the FBI/CIA/NSA/NRO.
Internet commerce products alone would bring in shit
loads of revenue for these agencies.  And, as a
side-benefit for these agencies, many companies will
opted for GAK just for export tax reasons.
This, of course, will not please the crypto-purists,
but crypto is just one of many areas where the
government is feeling like it is losing control.  And
while that attitude is just infantile, we have to be
realistic about those very human people and very human
organizations who have a tough job to do.  As much as I
hate ITAR, I feel really bad for the NSA.
1.  Fundamentally, I only oppose ITAR on First
Amendment grounds: I should be able to write any
program I can type, and I should be able to give that
program out.  This is computer speech, but it sure is
speech.  Therefore, my personal interest is to perserve
that freedom.  (If I happen to write a book about
dangerous chemicals or explosives [write crypto code],
why should I be held criminally liable if a terrorist
buys my book [downloads my source code] or steals it
from a library [intercepts an E-Mail containing the
2.  My guess is that the NSA has NOT really advanced
the state of the art of crypto much.  I suspect they
have capabilities that are maybe one or two orders of
magnitude (in terms of art, not pure bruteforce
resources) ahead of us common folks, but we can crank
up the computational complexity without a wink, and
then, they are just helpless.  One particular
rumoroid/factoid worth keeping in mind is that they
have succeeded in the past, not just by being smarter,
but also by dumbing-down everyone else.  Sooner or
later, that part of the strategy will no longer work.
3.  There is something to be said for controlling
export and import of products when the rest of the
world is not using a economic system quite like ours.
There is also something to be said for controlling
export of products that might reduce our national
strategic advantage (whatever that means).
Of course, there is also self-delusion, and, if I were
to assume the FBI/NSA is being completely honest,
self-delusion is what they seem to be falling back on.
I mean, REALLY now, if you can't control huge cabinets
of supercomputers (oops ... I guess they are just
desktop pizza boxes now, aren't they?), how are you
going to control bits?

@_subject: FC: Responses to Tim May's criticism of SAFE, and a rebuttal 
Ok, I think I can agree with your principles, if they are stand-alone.
However, I believe the issue here is not whether your (and Tim's)
principles are correct; instead, the issue here is of time and what
time we have left.  I must point out the following:
    The NSA/FBI is NOT standing still while we are all bickering about
    precisely which dotted-i and crossed-t to support.  They can, at
    the stroke of Clinton's executive order pen, initiate effectively
    THEIR law, while we must gather forces and summon Congress to jump
    through enough hoops to pass effective legislation.
In short, they can get what they want instantly, while we cannot
except through a long and arduous process (during which they can throw
many procedural and lobbying obstacles to slow us down).  The process
is clearly in THEIR favor (and not without good reason), and we must
face that fact.
In an ideal world, when we can stop time for as long as we want to sit
around a table and discuss just what is good and bad legislation, we
can afford to be pure on principle.  However, time is running out
because the longer we wait for ANY legislation to pass, the more
nations the NSA will coerce behind closed doors (and remember, you
have ZERO real ability to affect these slimy maneuvers) in the name of
national security.
It takes just one Om Shinri Kyo (sp?) in any nation to convince its
leaders to pass knee-jerk panic legislation in the name of security,
and it's the fault of politics at the beck and call of human nature
(not just stupid politicians).
NO!  This is totally contrary to the facts!
And I don't understand why you did not respond to this point when I
brought it up earlier.  This area is MOST CERTAINLY NOT free of
legislation.  Have you tried to openly export a IDEA- or 3DES-based
non-key-recovery (real commercial) product lately?  Have you set up an
open, publically announced FTP site where anyone can freely fetch
strong encryption sources?  If not, then explain why, if there is no
legislation on this matter, couldn't you do it?
Just because there isn't an explicit bill somewhere that, in no
uncertain terms, clearly grants or denies a right to Americans, does
not mean that no government agency have any real effective claim on
control of the matter.  Why else would we be having this discussion?

@_author: Ernest Hua 
@_subject: FC: Responses to Tim May's criticism of SAFE, and a rebuttal 
Ok.  I'll give you a brownie point for an FTP site.  I honestly don't
think the NSA has time to go after a few, small-time, non-commercial
FTP sites, and I don't believe site maintainers like you have much to
lose on this matter.  The NSA is not as dumb as the Scientologists on
fighting a handful of individuals on the Net (most of whom can easily
get any job they want in the high tech industry, including charging
backlash is even worse).
On the other hand, SGI, Sun, HP, IBM, AT&T, etc. have much more to
lose than you do.  They have huge government contracts (which they
coincidentally announced very soon after they signed up for the
key-recovery initiative), which the NSA can threaten.  They have other
export licenses (non-encryption-related) they need.
Well, I'm not going to get technical here on just what is in effect.
A presidential order is often as good as a hard legislation.  In this
case, it is just as good.  And it's not just encryption.  Look at what
happened to SGI when several supercomputers were discovered to have
gone to China?  Again, it's just an execute order, not hard
legislation.  (And there are good reasons for giving the executive
branch executive priviledge, as there is no reason to micromanage
other branches of the government unless there is a serious issue.)
And this is what the administration argued for before enough
legislators thought it was a serious issue.
My conclusion on the issue of whether or not there is legislation on
this matter, is yes.  Is it technically a bill which passed congress?
No.  Is it some rule that some branch of government can use to harass
you?  Yes.  That's effective enough for me (in fact, it's worse,
because it is "more arbitrary").

@_date: 1997-05-06 03:06:06
@_author: Ernest Hua 
@_subject: FC: Responses to Tim May's criticism of SAFE, and a rebuttal 
Yup.  But again, they are given that priviledge for good reasons, one
of which is that they are supposedly the "experts", whatever that
I think this really depends upon how the "terrorism" cause is
determined.  If it is the arbitrary decision of the executive branch
alone, then we have to question why the Clinton administration still
believes we are under such imminent threat, and how this is different
from the critieria being imposed by the SAFE provisions.
I think we violently agree here, except for one-sided terminologies
like "freedom fighters" or "terrorists".
However, here is where we don't necessarily agree.  Laws are around to
allow some "civilized" co-existance, where "civilized" is defined by
the basic rights and liberties of members of that society.  It is
important to follow laws for what they are intended to do.  It is
important to have a viable process for questioning and revising laws
which do not have desired intent or effective control.  It is also bad
to have laws which do not clearly define what they restrict, and it is
here which I, and many others, do not like ITAR.
I don't buy the burden of multiple export version argument because
most software exports HAVE to have multiple export versions for other
reasons such as language, cultural considerations, etc ...
I don't completely like the first amendment argument because it is
solely based on claiming that software is, first and foremost,
expression.  In fact, software has mechanism and side effect of
mechanism.  If software were strictly expression, it is hard to
imagine how a multi-billion industry could have spawned from such an
inert practice.  Another example: one could argue that crafting an
grenade launcher is artistic expression, but surely few would consider
THAT argument when faced with such an "expressive" neighbor.  The
point here is that software, by itself, could never have the imminent
danger that a grenade launcher could have.  Therefore, it should be
incumbent upon the export regulators to prove that the software poses
imminent danger before they should be allowed to regulate export.
In that sense, I have no problems with restricting, for instance,
software which is specifically designed to, say, hide the transport of
nuclear weapons.  Of course, I have no idea how one could design a
piece of software to do that, but IF the DoC/DoD/NSA/FBI can prove
that a piece of software was designed primarily to do that, then I'll
be happy to allow them to restrict the export of THAT specific piece
of software.
On the other hand, most software, especially those that fall into the
freeware or shareware category on the Net, have proven to be of
significant positive contribution to society.  Encryption is a
fundamental element (not the only element) in protecting our Net.  In
addition, equivalent strength or better encryption is already
available outside the U.S., so the laws do not have any real effect on
the general spread of encryption, unless of course, we have any
legitimate interest in deliberately crippling the protection
mechanisms in GII.  If there is, it would have to be a one-sided and
government-only interest (and I know that these arguments are based on
outdated Cold War thinking).  Therefore, I must conclude that, while
there may have been reasons in the past for restricting encryption
export, it is no longer net positive value for the U.S., as a nation,
to restrict its export.
This is why I don't care if SAFE explicitly declares that using
encryption to hide a crime is illegal (though I don't see the need for
an explicit declaration).  As long as SAFE invalidates ITAR with
respect to encryption, then Americans no longer have to prove that
encryption exports are being used for "bad" purposes; now it is up to
law enforcement to prove that an export is being used for "bad"
While that may sound like a small gain, it is a huge win for
encryption liberty.

Well, which "step" are you referring to?  The Clinton administration
is quite skilled at PR, and their intent is to project the image of
"middle of the road" and "balanced".  Of course, those are meaningless
words, but they sound real good in the context of the opponents being
painted as extremists.  For instance, take a look at the words which
the administration's appointee's use.  Bruce Lehman, et al have all
liken their opponents to David Koresh and other groups considered to
be extreme by the general public.
So far, the only high-profile "steps" they have taken is to put out
more Clipper-esque execute orders and call them "compromises".  These
are just maneuvers, but they still are effective executive orders,
none the less.
That is why they back off prosecuting Zimmerman.  I don think they saw
a lose-lose scenario there, and decided it was better to leave the law
ambiguous rather than let it become well-defined, in the best case.
Ok, so are you saying that they did not make a totally one-sided
executive order without consulting ANYONE?  Sure, I agree that they
did not do that.  However, that would be silly, as it would not appear
convincing when they claim "middle of the road".
In fact, they still got what they wanted anyway (except for the
arbitrary key recovery which the NSA can do with the Clipper).  The
point here is that Joe-Small-Town sheriff needs the cost/speed/stealth
requirements of applying two aligator clips to get a wire tap, and
they got it.
Yes, this is the point of the PR.  Keep the opposition from having a
major rallying point.

a sweeping right today, as it is hard to imagine what would constitute
genuine and effective civil defense against a tyrannical government given
the power of today's governments.
In some convoluted way, one could argue that encryption is one way to
defend ourselves against a tyrannical state as the state's power is held
in check if they cannot arbitrarily gather information on anything or
anyone.  Of course, to say that could effectively diminish the argument
for physical defense as one is effectively trusting the integrity of one's
interconnect to the NII/GII.  If you don't trust the government, you

@_subject: FBI calls for mandatory clap escrow; Denning on export controls 
All clap-on products sold or distributed in the U.S.
must have a clap escrow backdoor "like an airbag in a
car," law enforcement agents advised a Senate panel
this afternoon.
FBI Director Louis Freeh also told a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee that "appliance makers should be required
to have some immediate clap signature ability
available" permitting agents to readily identify
clappers who turned on or turned off appliances.
This marks the most aggressive push to date for
mandatory domestic clap escrow (or "clap recovery"),
which means someone else other than the clapper can
figure out who did the clapping.
Freeh noted that "technology has greatly changed the
balance of power in favor of the criminal element.  We
must right that balance by giving law enforcement the
tools necessary to catch the criminals.  The ability to
remotely enable/disable terrorist devices is a serious
challenge to law enforcement, and the only to stop its
criminal use is to allow law enforcement the ability to
identify the clapper.  Of course, there is already full
due-process procedures to ensure that law enforcement
officers do not violate the privacies of law-obiding
clappers.  But under a court-order warrant, we must be
able to trace the clap to its origin."
Many privacy and civil rights groups have raise
objections against such regulations.  Several court
challenges to existing clap export limits are well
under way, all citing 1st Amendment violations.
Lawyers for the Department of Commerce insists that the
limits have nothing to do with the 1st Amendment, and
that Commerce (and formerly, the Department of State)
has consistently approved all export requests for
printed claps.  "But real clapping is a mechanism, not
an element of speech; it truly enables or disables
devices, including bombs and weaponery.  There are
several industries where we not only allow, but
encourage the use of clap-on technology, but we simply
cannot allow arbitrary export of clap-on devices,
because terrorists could get their hands on it."
Sen. Jon Kyl, chair of the Judiciary subcommittee on
technology, terrorism, and government information,
opened today's hearing not by saying its purpose was to
discuss clapping in a balanced manner, but that he
wanted "to explore how clap-on is affecting the way we
deal with criminals, terrorists, and the security needs
of business." Then he talked at length about "criminals
and terrorists" using clap-on bombs, and child
pornographers "using clap-on to view pornographic
images of children that they transmit across the
Dorothy Denning, a Georgetown University professor of
computer science, did testify.  Kyl made a point of
asking her if she still supported clap escrow systems
(two recent articles by Will Rodger and Simson
Garfinkel said she was changing her mind).  "I think
clap recovery offers a very attractive approach,"
Denning said.  What about export controls? "In the
absence of any controls, the problem for law
enforcement would get worse," she replied.
But when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) asked if
Denning would support a *mandatory* clap escrow system,
the computer scientist said she wouldn't.  "No, because
we don't have a lot of experience we clap recovery
systems ... a lot of people are legitimately nervous."
Sen. Feinstein asked Dir. Freeh if such voluntary
systems would give the clapping criminal freedom to
simply turn off the features to support lawful clap
recovery.  Dir. Freeh replied that he was certainly
"warm" to the ideal of mandatory clap escrow, but
public opinion simply did not support it.
Recent FOIA'ed documents obtained by EPIC, a privacy
watchdog group, showed that, as far back as the Reagan
administration, clap-on technology was under the
scrutiny of the law enforcement and intelligence
agencies.  The memos include references to the Digital
Clapphony legislation, which was pushed through two
years ago by heavy last-minute behind-the-scene
lobbying in the congressional budget bill, and to the
proliferation of software clapping technology.

Key Passage:
    Clinton administration officials tried to fight passage of the
    resolution in the technology-heavy state, while at the same time
    trying to conceal their moves from industry opponents, according
    to lobbyists close to the floor action.
    Commerce Undersecretary William Reinsch, for example, sent the
    state senate committee considering the measure a three-page fax
    urging them to vote down the resolution an hour before a scheduled
    committee vote on Aug. 28.
    Officials of the Office of Management and Budget then tried to
    keep the contents of the fax secret from opponents by warning that
    the work was protected by copyright and could not be shown outside
    the committee without violating the author's copyright.
    "We eventually got a copy anyway. It's nothing but the same old
    arguments," said Chuck Marson, a lobbyist for the Internet
    Industry Alliance, an industry group composed of Netscape
    Communications Corp., Microsoft Corp., America Online Inc. and
    Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc.
It is just utterly amazing that NO major news organization has yet to
challenge the Clinton Administration on this issue:
    That the Administration has consistently misrepresented the facts
    and, in some case, just plain lied, to the public, and have tried
    every under-handed method to slow the spread of encryption,
    key-recovery or not, and to increase the surveillence powers of
    law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
And now, here we are, on the eve of a series of important votes to gut
Goodlatte's SAFE legislation, and no one knows anything about the
slimeball tactics the Administration is using to regulate, for the
first time, what kind of software one can write.
Maybe it is just as well.  Perhaps the best way is to fold and appear
weak on the initial vote and let the whole damn thing pass (after all,
I'm willing to bet that the purpose of trying to gut the legislation
before it reaches the floor is to make it not worth anyone's vote).
If our side can get everyone to vote for the GAK-compliant version,
perhaps it will pave the way for a most excellant CDA-style challenge.

"Nothing other than some kind of mandatory key recovery really
    does the job," the California Democrat said at a hearing of the
    Senate Judiciary Committee's technology, terrorism, and government
    information subcommittee.
This comment may, in fact, be a powerful weapon against ANY control.
In fact, Feinstein is believing that no half-assed policy (including
the current policy and Kerrey's bill) will really help law enforcement
much.  I can imagine why Freeh would not just jump at that conclusion
full-force.  He is not that stupid.  If he were to hold onto that
conclusion too tightly, then there is little justification for any law
"encouraging" the proliferation of key-recovery products, as that
would be worthless in terms of providing relief to law enforcement.
Basically, Feinstein is providing further support for the
long-standing argument that unless you plug every leak (a.k.a. no
KR/GAK product), criminals will find the loop-hole and work around
government surveillence.

8 paragraphs down):
             (3) It would direct the Secretary of Commerce to
            allow the export or re-export of encryption-capable
            software for non-military end-uses in any country, or
            computers using such software based on considerations
            of foreign availability.
        Importantly, the committee notes that section 3 of H.R. 695
    would require the government to approve exports of high
    performance computers (so-called ``supercomputers'') if those
    computers contain encryption products or software that are
    commercially available. In the committee's view, this is one of
    the most serious consequences and flaws of the bill. Under this
    proposed arrangement, any company would be in a position to
    force the government to allow the export of even the most
    powerful supercomputer available in the United States, if they
    first loaded a piece of foreign-available encryption software
    on the supercomputer. As confirmed by Secretary Reinsch in his
    testimony before the committee, this provision would overturn
    the Spence-Dellums amendment to H.R. 1119, the National Defense
    Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, adopted by the House on
    June 19, 1997, by a vote of 332-88. That amendment would
    prevent the inadvertent export of supercomputers to
    questionable end users in countries of proliferation concern.
Are we getting screwed by a false link to supercomputers?

 THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARGUMENT FOR MANDATORY
 KEY ESCROW ENCRYPTION: THE "DANK" CASE
 REVISITED
 by Andrew Grosso
      (This article is a revised version of a talk given by the
 author at the 1996 RSA Data Security Conference, held in San
 Francisco, California.  Mr. Grosso is a former federal prosecutor
 who now has his own law practice in Washington, D.C.  His e-mail
 address is agrosso at acm.org.)
      I would like to start by telling a war story.  Some years ago,
 while I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I was asked to try a case
 which had been indicted by one of my colleagues.  For reasons
 which will become clear, I refer to this case as "the Dank case."
      The defendant was charged with carrying a shotgun.  This
 might not seem so serious, but the defendant had a prior record.  In
 fact, he had six prior convictions, three of which were considered
 violent felonies.  Because of that, this defendant was facing a
 mandatory fifteen years imprisonment, without parole.  Clearly, he
 needed an explanation for why he was found in a park at night
 carrying a shotgun.  He came up with one.
      The defendant claimed that another person, called "Dank,"
 forced him to carry the gun.  "Dank," it seems, came up to him in
 the park, put the shotgun in his hands, and then pulled out a
 handgun and put the handgun to the defendant's head.  "Dank" then
 forced the defendant to walk from one end of the park to other,
 carrying this shotgun.  When the police showed up, "Dank" ran
 away, leaving the defendant holding the bag, or, in this case, the
 shotgun.
      The jurors chose not to believe the defendant's story,
 although they spent more time considering it than I would like to
 admit.  After the trial,  the defendant's story became known in my
 office as "the Dank defense."  As for  myself, I referred to it as "the
 devil made me do it."
      I tell you this story because it reminds me of the federal
 government's efforts to justify domestic control of encryption.
 Instead, of "Dank,"  it has become, "drug dealers made me do it;"
 or "terrorists made me do it;" or "crypto anarchists made me do it."
 There is as much of a rationale basis behind these claims as there
 was behind my defendant's story of "Dank."  Let us examine some
 of the arguments the government has advanced.
      It is said that wiretapping is indispensable to law
 enforcement.  This is not the case.  Many complex and difficult
 criminal investigations have been successfully concluded, and
 successfully argued to a jury, where no audio tapes existed of the
 defendants incriminating themselves.  Of those significant cases,
 cited by the government, where audio tapes have proved
 invaluable, such as in the John Gotti trial, the tapes have been
 made through means of electronic surveillance other than wire
 tapping, for example, through the use of consensual monitoring or
 room bugs.  The unfetted use of domestic encryption could have no
 effect on such surveillance.
      It is also said that wiretapping is necessary to prevent
 crimes.  This, also, is not the case.  In order to obtain a court order
 for a wire tap, the government must first possess probable cause
 that a crime is being planned or is in progress.  If the government
 has such probable cause concerning a crime yet in the planning
 stages, and has sufficient detail about the plan to tap an individual's
 telephone, then the government almost always has enough
 probable cause to prevent the crime from being committed.  The
 advantage which the government gains by use of a wiretap is the
 chance to obtain additional evidence which can later be used to
 convict the conspirators or perpetrators. Although such convictions
 are desirable, they must not be confused with the ability to prevent
 the crime.
      The value of mandating key escrow encryption is further
 eroded by the availability of super encryption, that is, using an
 additional encryption where the key is not available to the
 government.  True, the government's mandate would make such
 additional encryption illegal; however the deterrence effect of such
 legislation is dubious at best.  An individual planning a terrorist
 act, or engaging in significant drug importation, will be little
 deterred by prohibitions on the means for encoding his telephone
 conversations.  The result is that significant crimes will not be
 affected or discouraged.
      In a similar vein, the most recent estimates of the national
 cost for implementing the Digital Telephony law, which requires
 that commercial telecommunications companies wiretap our
 nation's communications network for the government's benefit, is
 approximately three billion dollars.  Three billion dollars will buy
 an enormous number of police man hours, officer training, and
 crime fighting equipment.  It is difficult to see that this amount of
 money, by being spent on wire tapping the nation,  is being spent
 most advantageously with regard to law enforcement's needs.
      Finally, the extent of the federal government's ability to
 legislate in this area is limited.  Legislation for the domestic
 control of encryption must be based upon the commerce clause of
 the U.S. Constitution.  That clause would not prohibit an individual
 in, say, the state of California from purchasing an encryption
 package manufactured in California, and using that package to
 encode data on the hard drive of his computer, also located in
 California.  It is highly questionable whether the commerce clause
 would prohibit the in-state use of an encryption package which had
 been obtained from out of state, where all the encryption in done
 in-state and the encrypted data is maintained in- state.  Such being
 the case, the value of domestic control of encryption to law
 enforcement is doubtful.
      Now let us turn to the disadvantages of domestic control of
 encryption.  Intentionally or not, such control would shift the
 balance which exists between the individual and the state.  The
 individual would no longer be free to conduct his personal life, or
 his business, free from the risk that the government may be
 watching every move.  More to the point, the individual would be
 told that he would no longer be allowed to even try to conduct his
 life in such a manner.  Under our constitution, it has never been the
 case that the state had the right to obtain evidence in a criminal
 investigation.  Rather, under our constitution, the state was given
 the right to attempt to obtain such evidence.  The distinction is
 crucial:  it is the difference between the operation of a free society,
 and the operation of a totalitarian state.
      Our constitution is based upon the concept of ordered
 liberty.  That is, there is a balance between law and order, on the
 one hand, and the liberty of the individual on the other.  This is
 clearly seen in our country's bill of rights, and the constitutional
 protections afforded our accused:  evidence improperly obtained is
 suppressed; there is a ban on the use of involuntary custodial
 interrogation, including torture, and any questioning of the accused
 without a lawyer; we require unanimous verdicts for convictions;
 and double jeopardy and bills of attainder are prohibited.  In other
 words, our system of government expressly tolerates a certain level
 of crime and disorder in order to preserve liberty and individuality.
 It is difficult to conceive that the same constitution which is
 prepared to let a guilty man go free, rather than admit an illegally
 seized murder weapon into evidence at trial, can be interpreted to
 permit whole scale, nationwide, mandatory surveillance of our
 nation's telecommunications system for law enforcement purposes.
 It is impossible that the philosophy upon which our system of
 government was founded could ever be construed to accept such a
 regime.
      I began this talk with a war story, and I would like to end it
 with another war story.  While a law student, I had the opportunity
 to study in London for a year.  While there, I took one week, and
 spent it touring the old Soviet Union.  The official Soviet tour
 guide I was assigned was an intelligent woman.  As a former
 Olympic athlete, she had been permitted in the 1960's to travel to
 England to compete in international tennis matches.  At one point
 in my tour, she asked me why I was studying in London.  I told her
 that I wanted to learn what it was like to live outside of my own
 country, so I chose to study in a country where I would have little
 trouble with the language.  I noticed a strange expression on her
 face as I said this.  It was not until my tour was over and I looked
 back on that conversation that I realized why my answer had
 resulted in her having that strange look.  What I had said to her was
 that I had chosen to go to overseas to study; further, I had said that
 I had chosen where to go.  That I could make such decisions  was a
 right which she and the fellow citizens did not have.  Yes, she had
 visited England, but it was because her government chose her to
 go, and it was her government which decided where she should go.
 In her country, at that time, her people had order, but they had no
 liberty.
      In our country, the domestic control of encryption
 represents a shift in the balance of our liberties.  It is a shift not
 envisioned by our constitution.  If  ever to be taken, it must be
 based upon a better defense than what "Dank," or law enforcement,
 can provide.

 I believe MOST people would agree with this statement.
 I must point out, however, that your next statement does not logically
 follow because the primary complaint of the NSA/FBI is that unless the
 work factor is artificially reduced (via some method) to some
 negligible point, their jobs in the future will become much harder
 (that is, if all they do is stick with the same ol' operational
 methods) per intercept.  In fact, they are claiming that "much harder"
 could mean "practically impossible".

 I am ignoring the comments on protecting the US citizens against abuse
 of this lab.  I seriously doubt they could abuse significant numbers
 of individuals given free market development of encryption.  If there
 was only one standard (say, DES), then there would only be one target.
 If there were 100 standards and 1000 data formats each, you can pretty
 much kiss this lab good bye.  It is much more likely that this lab
 will engage in breaking incompetent criminal-use cryptography.  It is
 unlikely that this lab can engage in the sort of mass data sweeps that
 NSA has been priviledged enough to do in the past.
 This sudden drop in capabilities and sudden jump in cost per intercept
 will enforce the status quo which the FBI has had to deal with to
 today.  The cost per intercept has been estimated at $50K per domestic
 target.  This is expensive enough that it does not make sense to tap
 anyone except where the cost can really be justified.

 I completely disagree here.  You might be right, but I give you 1
 million to 1 odds.  The NSA is absolutely NOT about to give up its
 role as the numero uno decryption lab without sacrificing many
 politicians (possibly with their lives, too, as its accountability to
 the public is near non-existent).
 The NSA is politically impossible to take on for very obvious reasons.

 The astronomical cost per decryption and the lack of a guarantee that
 it might necessarily produce useful evidence will guarantee that this
 tool is not abused.  I agree with this kind of conclusion.
 That is, I believe that, if any side of this debate is to be
 guaranteed anything, it should be that abuse is guaranteed to be low,
 rather than LE access is guaranteed to be easy.

 I assure you that this debate will always be shifted toward the
 "suitcase nuke", kiddie porn, child molestor and drug dealers by the
 FBI and the NSA in secret briefings.  There is not a chance in hell
 they will give up the best PR tool they have to scare the legislators,
 judges and the president without anyone present to counter their
 arguments.
