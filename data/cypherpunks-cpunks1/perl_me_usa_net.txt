@_subject: CDR: firewall 
I'm having problem with my firewall. Can you help me with this?
For example take this simple program written in Perl:
use LWP::Simple;
print (get $ARGV[0]);
How can I retrieve a Html file outside my firewall. Do I need to do something
with proxy port? Letting this program pass through my proxy?
