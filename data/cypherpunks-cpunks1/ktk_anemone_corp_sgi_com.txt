@_subject: Dec. 10th Bay Area Cypherpunks Meeting 
i've decided to punt on mbone for now... technical difficulties have plauged making it happen.  seems like
many things can happen between a fri afternoon setup and a sat
broadcast.  will try again, probably in feb, but not for this meeting.

@_subject: cypherpunks mbone this sat. 
The monthly meeting of cypherpunks will be broadcast on the mbone this
saturday, july 9, from noon to 6.  The ports and ID's are as follows:
audio:  64264	51421
video:  43185	51863
This is being advertised using sd as well.
The main topic will be discussion of Phil Karn's swIPe package, which
was announced at Usenix last month.  It allows one to set up encrypted
IP tunnels over the exisiting IP network.  For those of you interested in attending in person, the meeting will
be held at Silicon Graphics in Cafe Iris, building 5.  To get there,
get off 101 at Shorline, and head towards the ampetheater.  Turn right
into the SGI parking lot after Charlston, and continue down to just
before the circle.  Building 5 will be on your right.
NOTE:  THE SGI PARKING LOTS ARE BEING RE-SURFACED THIS WEEKEND.  SO
YOU WILL HAVE TO PARK ON THE MAIN CAMPUS DRIVE OR ON THE CONCRETE
PARKING AREAS.  Katy Kislitzin

 We have the usual 2nd Saturday (March 12) meeting planned, but I
 *definitely* think cpunks should do something around the cfp
 conference.  last year we did an informal in-the-hotel-halls meeting,
 but since this cfp is in the bay area....  I propose keeping the
regular March and April mtgs, and adding a cpunks dinner &&|| BOF at
cfp.  other ideas?
 ps CFP is March 28-31, at the sf airport marriot in burlingame ca.

@_subject: EARLY WARNING: Decemeber SF Bay Area Cyperpunks 
Eric Messick and I will be holding the Decemeber C'punks meeting at
our geodesic dome in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  It will be a
combination meeting and holiday get-together.  It will be happening on
the usual c'punks saturday, Dec 9, but will start at 4:00 pm instead
of the usual noon.  A more spirited announcement will follow closer to
the date.
