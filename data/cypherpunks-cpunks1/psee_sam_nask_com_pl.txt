@_subject: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 
Hi all!
Just wonder if anyone had a closer look at the "Advanced security" option
built in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11. You can use a soft
of a public/private key when sending a mail via fax (Class 1) driver
Micrsoft Fax at Work. The key seems to be quite short and I wonder if that's
a real secure solution comparing eg. to PGP?
