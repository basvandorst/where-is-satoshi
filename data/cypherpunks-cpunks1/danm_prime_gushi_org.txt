The other thing that could be interesting of course is an onion-only
search engine, which could either compliment or reduce the need for vanity
Still, I don't see why the directory servers can't maintain this info.  It
would have to (for the most part) be first-come first-served, and I
suppose some sort of uptime monitoring should also play a part (i.e. if
you don't use it for say 6 months, you lose it).
Shame there's not a whole lot of clients that make use of SRV records, as
an onion specifier in there could prove remarkably useful in some way.
