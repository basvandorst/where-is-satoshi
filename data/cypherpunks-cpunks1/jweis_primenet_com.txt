Amazing aint it - a moron girl at Goldman Sachs of course told me I was crazy and anyone who felt Netscape was going to go over the top was a moron.
I guess these corporate types are going to have to get used to the idea that the "net" is here to stay and a huge industry to boot.

I have to agree, Netscape may spend some energy to upgrade their encryption, but it really won't buy them all that much.   SSL, to me, is like using a "security envelope" to mail cash or putting the club on your car.  It presents just enough of an obstacle to keep honest people honest.

@_subject: Cost to Crack Keys 
Is it opportunistic access of machines, Tim, or simple use of available machines? I don't think this kind of access is limited to one shot deals.  I've seen enough environments where the cpu cycles to achieve these kinds of tasks (brute forcing keys) are available and  no one is much going to care if it is done in a lowprofile manner.
Indeed - but what is the real market value of the cpu cycles needed to pull off the task at hand? I think its far less than $10,000.00
Thats like accepting the amortized value of an object as its real value. I don't think GAAP really comes into play here...

RSA wants money (this comes from speaking with an RSA sales guy - Dave Garifolio, who incidentially sends out really neat RSA folders full of info you can take out of the folder and put elsewhere leaving you a cool folder) for the toolkit, thats all.  They send you to some sister corp of theirs and then charge you for the license.  Dave tells me there might be a chance you could buy one kit from RSA, design the server and anyone who wanted to use it could pay something like a $300.00 fee to lic. the thing.
However, in the aformentioned folder, Dave sent me all kinds of "we want big cash" paperwork, which I have yet to read (as anything you've gotta put in a really cool folder to get me to read can't be worth the time out from sleeping.)
Uh, yeah.
