@_subject: illustrating govt's preoccupation with terrorism 
This is an excerpt from a LONG msg echoed to me by Dave Farber.  Though it's
from USIA -- not a police/enforcement agency -- it is nonetheless heavily
concerned with "terrorism", the theme repeatedly referenced in the White
House's Clipper Chip announcement.
I've included the first part down through the first article as an example,
and gave only the headlines of the remaining articles -- but you get the
Just FYI.  [And, no, I don't know where/how Dave got it electronically in the
first place.  :-)  ]

@_subject: more details from Denning 
I've been collecting this flow over the last few days, and finally have a
chance to upload it to 'punks.  I think all of it is new, but part of it
might have already appeared in the last several daze [sic] deluge.  If so,
apologies for repetition.
And, a coupla tidbits about Dorothy:  I have known her for several years,
worked closely with her on creating the first Computers, Freedom & Privacy
conference in 1991, have absolutely the *highest* regard for her integrity,
honesty and candor -- and absolutely trust what she says ... even when it's
about a subject on which we may disagree.
  Dorothy Denning is an honorable person with great personal integrity, and
I urge that she be treated as such -- even in disagreement.
