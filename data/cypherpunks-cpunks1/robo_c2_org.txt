@_subject: Direct Socket to Remailer? 
I've heard of telnetting to port 25 to send SEMI-untraceable e-mail.
The procedure, quite frankly, sounds rather complicated.
Most of my mail that I don't want traced goes through the Mixmaster
remailer network.  I'm using Winsock-compatible software via a PPP
connection.  Is it possible, for example, to tell my mailer software
to use the remailer itself, such as "remail.obscura.com" as the mail
host, rather than "mail.myISP.com"?  Will it work, at least for
sending, without having an account at "obscura.com", or whatever
remailer?  Would that be less traceable than sending it through my
ISP's mail host?

I wondered the same thing myself.  It would certainly be a more
cost-effective way for the NSA to compromise Mixmaster technology
than by brute force.
Consider this scenario ...  Mixmaster get's bought by the Acme
Crypto Company of Ft. Meade, MD.  They "improve" it, and offer a new
version.  It's even FREE (for non-commerical use)!  But their
"improvements" make it incompatible with previous versions, and so
you have to upgrade.  The new "commercial" version comes with no
SOURCE CODE, of course...
