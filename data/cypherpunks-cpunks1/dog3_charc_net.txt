Naw, it still wouldn't matter.
Who lost their job over the Waco massacre? Who was even repremanded? Took a while, but eventually the gov managed
to gloss it all over. No problem. Well, maybe
something of a problem, but nothing time wouldn't
cure, and no one had to resign, or even get
in hot water. The distant echos of Ruby Ridge still reverberate,
but in the end, nothing is comming of that either.

Weapons? Real, live useful weapons, such as small arms? John Moses Browning, father
of the gas powered automatic. Producer of the first gas operated belt fed
machine gun. Was a citizen gunsmith, not a corporation. The M1911, the
BAR, and by extention, the FN-FAL, the 30 and 50 cal crew served machine
guns. This was just a guy. Then John Garand, father of the "best battle
rifle in history" the M1 Garand, the liberator of
europe, from which the M14 was derived, Was a gunsmith in the employ of  the department of the army. Garand declined a patent on his rifle, as
he felt a patent would occlude the weapons manufacture. He was an
open source kinda guy. Garand and Browning would be hunted animals under todays laws. No knocks against Eugene Stoner, the "father" of the M16, but
his prototype was redesigned in committee by large corporations
the likes of which brought us the M60 and other such jammomatic
battle weapons. The US, by outlawing private weapons development that once
allowed them to arm and deploy the most fearsome defensive
force in history, has now turned to places like Belgium for
the M249, and our good buddies H&K with thier 3rd Reich derived
MP-series for our storm troopers.

I'ma M1911 man myself. I have fired this weapon in question
and found it quite agreeable. I was pretty amazed. I thought
they were just toys for rich kids. However, if you need a rifle, take a rifle. For the bulk of that thing, might was well carry
a carbine.

Well, this is pretty much pure bullshit. The LE folks are hip to using ir imaging to figure
out who is running a whole lotta lights inside at
night to determine who is doing home cultivation. They use this technique as probable cause to request
a (rubber stamped) search warrant. Not the other way
This type of surveillence is allowed without warrent because it is non-invasive.

Wow Declan, Shame on me for not checking my facts. I'm rather amazed.
This is pretty contrary to the standard behavior of these folk, but the vote was close and the dissent strongly worded. Thanks for keeping me honest.
That said, in reality, I don't expect this to make much
difference. The cops have this technology, they will use this technology.
