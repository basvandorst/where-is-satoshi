 ** PREVENTION TRAUMA II
 **
 **         In a previous letter I pointed out the need to eliminate
 ** trauma by prevention. I mentioned that there are generally Agencies
 ** whose function is to prevent trauma, if it is in industry, military,
 driving,
 ** etc. These agencies have criteria for excluding people who they feel
 ** are liable to mal-function and cause trauma (danger). Often these
 ** Agencies employ programs to reduced the likelihood of trauma.
 **         I pointed out that I feel it is legitimate to help these Agencies
 ** not in defining their criteria but in eliciting the given criteria by
 the use
 ** of the techniques which are used in a Diagnostic Setting. I emphasize
 ** that the presence or absence of these criteria are not indicative of any
 ** pathology. As such I feel that this discussion does not only belong in
 ** the field of Forensic Psychiatry but is a legitimate form of treating
 ** trauma, i.e. prevention.
 **         In the field of Road Safety in Israel the Institute for Road
 ** Safety is a medical institute which advises on likelihood of a driver to
 ** be dangerous.
 **         The examination is carried out on all applicants for a Public
 ** License (taxi, autobus), heavy vehicle drivers, and drivers involved in
 ** fatal accidents, and drivers or prospective drivers who have had
 ** contact with Mental Health Care. Generally the exams are given by
 ** Psychologists and are based partially on the M.M.P.I. and a clinical
 ** examination. More difficult cases are referred to Consultant
 ** Psychiatrists and an Ad-Hoc Committee.
 **         The criteria under discussion are mainly:- Concentration,
 ** Attention, Projectivity, Judgment, Consistency, Reality Jesting, Ability
 ** to identify , Confirm with instructions, Impulsivity and Control over
 ** Impulsivity.
 **         Over the years we have found these to be of primary
 ** importance and we thus concentrate on illnesses or personality
 ** disturbance where these criteria may well occur.
 **         If these indications are discovered we check if they are
 ** causing driving delinquency. If so, we then determine if there is a
 ** reasonable likelihood of the patient / examinee being made to
 ** understand and correct himself. Obviously in some instances this is of
 ** little likelihood. If these indications are present or applying for a new
 ** license, the application is rejected. If we allow a "trial" period, the
 ** position is first explained to the examinee, and we try and ascertain if it
 ** at all possible that he both understands and is able of "changing his
 ** ways".
 **         In addition to the "meeting point" between Forensic
 ** Psychiatry and "Preventive" Traumatology we feel that we are on the
 ** delicate meeting point of "Personal Rights" and Societies "Right to
 ** defend itself".
 **         We are under perpetual scrutiny, which I feel is justified and
 ** healthy. I would very much enjoy any comments or suggestions.

In the march '96 issue of macworld there's a "Viewpoint" reporting on the
progress of the info superhighway.  Privacy and security issues predominate
the text, the primary source of which is larry irving --- "a top
administration adviser on telecommunications."
One issue, "mouse droppings" --- "a trail of every site they visit and for
how long [on the www], was highlighted as an example of existing privacy
regulations falling short of consumer expectations.  Apparently, the
amorphous public is shocked, *SHOCKED* I tell you , to discover that their
service providers are selling the personal preference information to the
highest bidder.  More info in article.
Would some rocket scientist speak to this terrifying mouse droppings issue?
