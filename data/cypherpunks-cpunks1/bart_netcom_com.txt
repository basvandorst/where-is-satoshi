Just received a low budget brochure from SVC offering their
    "Secure Voice" TM software for $250. Used with a '386 minimum,
    a Sound Blaster board, and a 14.4K V.42 modem they claim to
    do compression and DES encryption (triple DES with a '486).
    "You talk into your computer, the computer digitizes your voice,
    encrypts it, transmits it through the high speed modem over the
    open phone lines to the other end, where it is decrypted, and
    can be heard."
    They indicate you need one "Secure Voice" for each end so I'd
    guess they have it copy protected.

I'm not really sure what point I wish to make. Packwood on     McNeill-Lehrerer seemed to deserve consideration. The question
    of what one may expect to be private seems paramount. Just now
    the whole country is paying attention to the issue, so if you     can figure a way to attract their attention, major leverage may be     obtained.
    What would Packwood have gained if he had used PGP or DES ?

I never thought I be caught dead forward an LD post, but here
    it is since I may be the only 'punk on the NEW-LIST announcements.
    Here we see the other side. I am beginning to get a funny feeling
    about all this. Consider:
    1. The book published for profit by editing the submissions to
       rec.humor.funny.
    2. The recent "compilation copyright" filed by Keith Peterson
       on the material contained in the Simtel archive.
    3. The default apparent public domain into which all our postings
       seem to fall.
    Is LD, the prolific author that he obviously is, merely baiting
    the creative minds of the cypherpunks to gather material for his
    forthcoming novel(s)?

From the National Information Infrastructure Agenda for Action:
       Action:  Review privacy concerns of the NII.  The IITF has
         developed a work plan to investigate what policies are
         necessary to ensure individual privacy, while recognizing
         the legitimate societal needs for information, including
         those of law enforcement.  The IITF has also developed a
         work plan to investigate how the government will ensure that
         the infrastructure's operations are compatible with the
         legitimate privacy interests of its users.           Action:  Review of encryption technology.  In April, the
         President announced a thorough review of Federal policies on
         encryption technology.  In addition, Federal agencies are
         working with industry to develop new technologies that
         protect the privacy of citizens, while enabling law
         enforcement agencies to continue to use court-authorized
         wiretaps to fight terrorism, drug rings, organized crime,
         and corruption.  Federal agencies are working with industry
         to develop encryption hardware and software that can be used
         for this application.

@_subject: Phil Zimmermans's statement (reposted) 
Date--Sun, 19 Sep 1993 13:38:44 -0500
From--Philip Zimmermann Subject--Zimmermann statement on PGP investigation
Some of you may have received my Internet message of a couple of days
ago about the ongoing U.S. Customs investigation of the exportation
of PGP, which has now progressed to the level of Federal Grand Jury
subpoenas.  This earlier message was intended by me for distribution
to a very small group of friends who previously communicated their
concern about me and the investigation and asked to be kept
informed.  I did not send the message to anyone outside this group.
Unfortunately, I did not adequately assert my desire that the message
not be further disseminated.  It appears that the message has gone
completely public.  This was not my intention.
My lawyer, Phil Dubois, has been in touch with the Assistant U.S.
Attorney (William Keane) assigned to the investigation.  We have no
reason to believe that Mr. Keane is anything other than a professional
and reasonable person.  He made it clear that no decision has been
made regarding any prosecution of anyone for any offense in this
matter.  Such decisions will not be made for some time, perhaps
several months.  Mr. Keane also made clear his willingness to listen
to us (me and my lawyer) before making any decision.  It appears that
both Mr. Keane's mind and the lines of communication are open.
My fear is that public dissemination of my message will close the
lines of communication and put Mr. Keane into an irretrievably
adversarial position.  Such a result would not serve any of our
interests.  My lawyer tells me that nothing irritates a prosecutor
more than being the subject of what he perceives to be an
orchestrated publicity campaign.  He also tells me that his
nightmares involve FOAs (Friends Of the Accused), invariably people
with good intentions, doing things on their own.  I understand that
the issues involved in this investigation are of the greatest
importance and transcend my personal interests.  Even so, I would
rather not turn an investigation into a full-scale federal
prosecution.  I ask that everyone keep in mind that the government's
resources are limitless and that mine are not.
Speaking of resources, many of you have offered help, and I am
grateful.  Those wishing to contribute financially or otherwise
should contact either me or Philip L. Dubois, Esq., at dubois at csn.org
or by phone at 303-444-3885 or by mail at 2305 Broadway, Boulder, CO,
80304.  Mr. Dubois has just got on the Internet and is still learning
how to use it.  Donated funds will be kept in a trust account, and all
contributions will be accounted for.  If this whole thing somehow goes
away with money left in the account, the balance will be refunded to
contributors in proportion to the amounts of their contributions.
This message can be widely circulated on public forums.

OPEN SECRET
    Instead of using mathematical codes to scramble and unscramble
messages, Georgia Tech physicists are devising a way of sending a message
with electronic noise generated by a flickering laser. By connecting
identical lasers over fiber optics, the same random pattern of noise is
generated at both the sending and receiving end, and the receiving simply
subtracts the noise to uncover the message. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
2320 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515
                                  March 17, 1994
                                  Special Notice
Because of considerable advance interest in next Tuesday's hearing on
Internet security, we are taking the liberty of including a witness list
for the hearing with this week's calendar mailing.  The hearing will take
place beginning at 9:30 a.m. in 2318 Rayburn on Tuesday, March 22, and will
be chaired by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA).
The Subcommittee's interest in the issue arises in part because the
Internet is a prime method of communication between researchers in academia
and industry.  It is also a major means of communication for federal
researchers at agencies under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.
Recent break-ins on the Internet prompted the federal Computer Emergency
Response Team to issue a special alert to Internet users on February 3, and
suggest that the system may be more vulnerable than generally acknowledged
to deliberate destruction or alteration of computer files.  The hearing
will evaluate the status of security on the Internet today and will

@_subject: Toolkits, Bugs, and Interfaces 
Ten days ago Tim May ended a post on Toolkits:
    "For digital money to succeed, there had better not be flaws and
    loopholes that allow attackers to drain your money away or to cause
    confusion and doubt amongst your customers!..."
    I think near certainty of correct function is needed for all
    cryptographic software to find acceptance with the general public.
    Of the the aspects needed, algorithmic correctness has received
    most attention here thusfar.  I want to second Tim's call for a
    Toolkit in particular relation to two other needs: a facile user
    interface and freedom from bugs.  These are necessary so that
    when Alice Anyone feels the need for crypto, she can get software,
    easily used, that prevents foolish misuse, and is both free of
    bugs and weakness to attack.
    At the state of the art, we cannot guarantee these any more than
    we can assert the future security of our algorithms.  But our best
    approach is to get working tools into the hands of testers and
    critical users to begin the process of debugging and revision.
    I would suggest that cypherpunks both write and test code.
    I recommend two books to stimulate thought on debugging and interface
    design, both of which I enjoyed reading.  "Digital Woes: Why we
    should not depend on software" by Lauren Ruth Weiner is a new,
    (First printing - Sept.93) work about bugs.  In 209 pages, backed
    by 365 citations to the literature (often comp.risks), it offers a
    view of the range of software failures that have occurred.      Perhaps we can attend to history and not need to repeat it.
    Donald Norman's "Design of veryday Things" is an outstanding work
    on interface design.  An excerpt that I read in Dr. Dobbs one     morning made me rush to a bookshop and buy it before noon!
    	HOW TO DO THINGS WRONG
    	If you set out to make something difficult to use, you could
    	probably do no better than to copy the designers of modern
    	computer systems....:
    	* Make things invisible.  Widen the Gulf of Execution:     	give no hints to the operations expected.  Establish a Gulf
    	of Evaluation: give no feedback, no visible results of the
        actions just taken.  Exploit the tyranny of the blank screen.
    	...
    	* Be inconsistent: change the rules.  Let something be done
    	one way in one mode and another way in another mode. This is
    	especially effective where it is necessary to go back and forth
    	between these modes.
    	...
    	* Make operations dangerous.  Allow a single erroneous action
    	to destroy invaluable work.  Make it easy to do disastrous
    	things.  But put warnings in the manual; then when people
    	complain, you can ask, "But didn't you read the manual?"

Three items.  On p.41 at 2/3 page review of Schneier's     "Applied Cryptography" favorable if not raving.
    In the What's New Hardware pages:
    The Crypto-Com V.32bis asynchronous pocket modem ($895) from
    Western Datacom (Westlake, OH) encrypts all data transmissions
    between two of the companies modems.  800 262 3311
    [ It uses single DES they said when I called ]
    Lastly a seven page article "Distributed and Secure" by a
    Russell Kay whose bio says he edited Infosecurity News and
    Computer Security Journal.  The box on the front page says
    "When you distribute information and processing, you also
    delegate security responsibility.  Good access controls,
    eyes open administration, and communication encryption can
    make all the difference".   Login control token technology
    is reviewed, Kerberos discussed and explained, PK crypto
    including PGP, and the Andrew file system.
    Something new to me was:
    "... NSA recently placed a large order for what it calls
    'sniffless password generators' with Secure Computing in
    Roseville, Minnesota.
    	With the company's Lockout system, instead of sending a
    password over the wire "in clear,"  you send a cryptographic
    representation of it, using a one time encryption key. Each
    time you login, the password is encrypted with a different key.
    The NSA will use Lockout in conjunction with its Tessera Crypto
    Card, a PCMCIA device. ... It uses both NIST's Digital Signature
    Algorithm and the NSA's Mosaic encryption algorithms."

@_subject: (fwd) RSA CEO Bidzos on USML/ITAR 
Newsgroups: talk.politics.crypto
RSA CEO/President D. James Bidzos, in a speech before the
Commonwealth Club of California, openly stated his opposition to
current USML/ITAR controls.  "We stand to lose a significant
part of our industry due to export controls", said Bidzos in the
taped address shown on C-Span 12/25/95.  The recent teaming of
Sun with ex-Soviet programmers to avoid U.S. export controls on
encryption was cited by Bidzos as an example of exactly how jobs
and opportunities are being forced off shore by U.S. policy.
Bidzos statements echo the remarks from Microsoft CEO, Bill
Gates, who also lashed out at federal export restrictions in his
comments before the National Press Club in early Decemeber.
This author noted some months ago the teaming of Ernst & Young
and SOFTWARE (AG), a german based software firm, to provide
encryption security with no import regulations.  Foreign
companies are allowed freely to compete in the U.S. domestic
market while U.S. citizens are restricted from the international
market.  This imbalance costs american jobs, taxes, rapidly
erodes our lead in this important area of science and is unfair.
The regulations, instead of limiting access to foriegn criminals
and terrorists, has led to a U.S. funded explosion of better
off-shore products that are beyond law enforcement control.  In
fact, the Federal government not only encourages this effort but
even has a multi-million dollar contract with SOFTWARE (AG).
The time for these regulations has clearly passed.  Yet, our
government is not geared for quick action, nor will self-seeking
bureaucrats ever be convinced to let go.  The world, however,
will quickly leave us behind unless we act soon.

    Its a very much post cypherpunk world he writes about, e.g.:
    "    ... It all had to do with unbreakable encryption, digital
    authentification, anonymous remailing, and network untraceability.
    These were all computer networking techniques that had once been
    considered very odd and naughty.  They were also so elementary to
    do, that once they were in place, they couldn't be stopped     without tearing the whole Net down.
    Of course once these techniques were in place, they conclusively
    destroyed the ability of governments to control the flow of
    electronic funds, anywhere, anytime, for any purpose.  As it
    happened, this process had pretty much destroyed any human control
    at all over the modern electronic economy. ..."

A final step might be to interface the output to old pen plotters

My motivation in suggesting the use of a pen-plotter to generate

    blood human who doesn't do computers or even FAX.  Somewhere,
    perhaps from Jim Warren or the EFF, I had heard that the pols
    payed attention to handwritten letters far more than FAXs or
    email or phone calls.  The rant generator-to-postal mail gateway
    might give netters more leverage than we have now.

    Uh, no one can't change pen pressure, but I think it can be
    mimicked.  If the effect one seeks of changing pen pressure is
    to vary the line width or ink deposited onto the paper then
    varying speed, and/or overwriting with or without offset can
    achieve interesting effects.  If I recall correctly, the HP
    pen position is addressable to 0.001" resolution, (though not
    accuracy.)  I recall creating some nice effects with multiple
    pen colors offset by a few mils in x and y.

@_subject: USPS Electronic Commerce Services 
Because I registered for the upcoming Internet Expo in San Jose,
    I got, by mail, an announcement of forthcoming Post Office services.
    These "Postal Electronic Commerce Services" will be demo'd at     Booth 626 at this show on February 20-21.
    The flyer says:
    "Postal Electronic Commerce Services will provide end-to-end
    security, confidentiality, integrity, and proof of origin to
    all your electronic information transfer and storage."
    Interestingly they suggest that the government is to be a prime
    beneficiary:  "For governments to get full value from the increased
    use of personal computers and public access terminals (kiosks)
    the privacy and security of every transaction must be guaranteed."
    Under the HOW IT WORKS section, after a quick gloss on public key
    cryptography they state: "Once a person generates a unique key
    (using their own software), they will take the "public" part of
    that key to a postal representative along with documents that
    prove their identity. Postal Electronic Commerce Services will
    then issue a certificate which guarantees that the identity of
    the person matches the "public" key that they presented.
    PECS will also electronically postmark the document using its own
    set of "keys".  This guarantees the validity of the stamp and
    legally establishes the existence of the document."
    They offer a FAX number for further info: (202) 268 4399
    and a phone too at (202) 268 3435.
    No mention of GAK or key length limits that I could see.
    I will surely be at their booth on the 20th.
