i couldnt find a video of him performing it but listen to the lyrics feeling so inspired
secondly i must say i know carbohydrates arent bad i know bread is life and wheat is the staff of life a lot of fruits and veggies are quite sugary/ starchy for almost everyone eating all these foods in moderation will do them fine but remember i am trying to regulate an abnormality to a diabetic sugar is the devil to someone with celiac disease wheat is the devil to someone with milk allergies dairy is the devel and what ive come to believe that for some women who dont ovulate high blood sugar may be their devil and it definately is mine
i spent a few years calming down my teen angst and attempting to grow up i loved san luis obispo i was ready to chill there for good Yummy fabric ready to ship
breakfast i always have two eggs and salsa always i dont really get sick of it and it would really stink if i did because theres not a lot out there for breakfast actually when you are at your ideal weight and ovulating regularly you can have any kind of whole grain hot cereal without a problem you know steel cut oats etc i am not quite there yet berries and grapes are pretty low on the glycemic index and i have those too oh and i love cottage cheese with fruit
dear anne shirley its been a long time since i last wrote but i need your advice i am planning a primary activity for this spring since our theme for the year is my eternal family and we like to have our activities point the children to what they are learning i thought it might be nice if we have a picnic on or near the grounds of the mt timpanogos temple and let them bask in the beauty of that place and reflect on the importance of their own eternal family
i spent a few hours organizing my yarn and needles into that armoire and how every plan ive ever made has been reconstructed into something harder and better than what i laid out as my own agenda what an adventure it is
i am determined
well just as we were making preparations to get moving grant was granted that job he wanted right here in utah i guess were staying put (sorry shellie i wanted to live by you and drive to see ray and the beach on weekends real bad)
again happy things
all kits are shipped phew
me um we didnt have disney games when i was five
and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penny and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me do you have to be obsessed with yarn and needles and hooks like i am to think that is the most inviting little space youve ever seen dinner i kind of snack or have a lunch type meal again dinner is tricky because i still need to prepare dinner for my family so i do but im not super hungry at night so i just eat whatever broccoli a little of what theyre having or snacky stuff or chicken wings or crispy thin crust pizza but i always end the day with a low carb ice cream bar
seriously though my closest friends are fun real and honest good entertaining in love with life a little crazy down to earth deep and incapable of bs
with that heres the stuff i eat salad with chicken a different salad with chicken repeat repeat this is the hard thing about it not a ton of delicious options im kind of kidding ive found a few other yummy things too
