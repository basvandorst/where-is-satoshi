SLICK WILLIE'S SHITHOUSE SPECIAL!!!
  For a limited time, Slick Willie is offering you a chance to   provide your future children with a Conception-to-Grave life
  experience.
  For a campaign contribution of $1 million, you can conceive
  your child in the Lincoln bedroom and guarantee their burial
  at the Arlington National Cemetery.
  For an addition half-million dollar donation, Slick Willie is
  offering coupons your future children can use to live off of
  Federal Farm Subsidies or Welfare, depending on their preference
  for city-living or the country life.   ACT NOW! First hundred contributors will be entered in a drawing
  to be held for a pair of Paula Jones' panties! (A signed and
  numbered piece  from Slick Willie's personal
  collection.)
