How old was the check when it was presented (and how long was it from the
check's date until you had closed the account). If the check was stale then
you have a valid gripe about the bank's behavior. I've dealt in situations
where people are collecting checks which are going to be "stale" before
they are submitted for processing yet there is no request to post-date the
check nor setting up of an escrow account to hold/clear the money until it
can be turned over to the correct owner (they collect voting fees for a
convention where the winner gets the money but the holder of the election
is the one who is being sent the check to sit-on [for up to 6 months] until
the winner can be handed the stack of checks - There is a claim that the
holder of the election can not open a segregation/escrow account due to
bank rules or procedures).

There is no need to revoke the old key - you just create a new key with
both the old and new keys and send it to the KeyServer. The normal PGP
"Default" when there are more than one key with the same Email Address is
to use the last one (which would be last in the keyring as well as have the
latest date). By leaving the old key as NOT revoked it can still be used
but will tend to be replaced by the new longer key as people get your key
from the Server.
If you DO want to revoke the old key, you just send the Revocation
Certificate to the KeyServer along with the new longer key (but note that

I do not think that PGP 2.x can easily (ie: Automatically) use one key for
Signing and another for Encrypting a Message (it does both at the same time
if you ask). If I "Clear Sign" a message and then Encrypt it, then I get
the result but I'm not sure if doing the decrypt on such a message will
automatically spot the signature and verify it (as would occur with a E+S

@_subject: SSL search attack 
I see nothing wrong with the concept of being allocated an initial chunk
and having the scan software attempt to ACK it when 50% of it has been
searched. A successful ACK would allow the releasing of a new chunk (in
response) equal in size to the returned chunk. A failure of the Server to
accept the ACK would trigger a retry at set intervals (such as 75% and 100%
or 60/70/80/90/100%) until the Server responds. Thus the scanner is always
in possession of a Full Sized Chuck to scan (so long as the Server accepts
an ACK before the 100% done mark) and temporary failures will not stop the
process of a scanner as currently happens.
Note: All this does is alter the size of the initial chunk granted and
allow the scanner to report partial progress and reset the scanned range
back to the original chunk size (ie: The Scanner never has more than the
designated assigned chunk size at any time - it just gets refreshed in
pieces [thus allowing overlap of scanning with getting a new range to scan]
in lieu of all at once [which has a failure to accept the ACK as a bottle
neck in uninterrupted scanning]).

I was not suggesting that. I was just suggesting that the initial request
be for twice the amount of segments as you want to process during your
reporting interval and that except when you are getting ready to shut down,
you have one allocation ready as a spare in case you can't immediately be
given another allocation when you ACK one.
Example: I will be running for 8 Hours and I will report back every 30
minutes. I get an Hours worth of segments (Chunk 1 +2) when I first
connect. After 30 Minutes, I'm done with half of them. I then ACK that half
(Chunk1) and request another 30 minutes worth of segments (for scanning at
1H-1.5H). If I do not get it, I'm still working on the 2nd Chunk. At 1H, I
ACK Chunk2 and ask for Chunk4 (also I ACK Chunk 1 and/or request Chunk 3 if
either failed the first time at .5H). This continues until 7.5 when I ACK
and do not request a Chunk 17 (since I already have or I am requesting
Chunk 16 for the 7.5H-8H period).

I thought that the ACK gives starting location and number of segments. If I
get 500 segments and ACK at the 50% point I am sending an ACK for the
Starting Point and 250 Segments (the unprocessed part would then ACK
Start+250 for 250 when done) Just as of I had only gotten 250 in the first
place and was also given the next 250 Segment Chunk (ie: I was "Next
Requester" after my original allocation of 250).
No - It is the same load if you allow the first request to be twice the
size of the subsequent requests. If you ask people to request 30 minutes
worth of segments, there is no difference in load (if the Server responds
to each ACK when first attempted) if they start each run with a 1 hour
chunk (ie: 2X Chunk) and check in every 30 min to ACK a Chunk (and to get
the one to be worked on in a half an hour [and when you are 30 minutes away
from your shut down time, just ACK and do not request another chunk]) and
just getting a X sized chunk at your initial connection.
In the 2X method, you still have a X sized Chunk to work on for the next 30
Minutes if the Server is ignoring your ACK attempt (and when that Chunk has
been scanned you return both and get two more). This is hitting the Server
once every 30 minutes and NOT pounding away at it until you get an ACK
through (and more get more work) since you have no need for another chunk
immediately (as you would with the X sized Chunk every 30 minutes method)
and thus have no need to retry on a connect failure.

Neither do I (exactly) but it was one of those cases where the program was
leased for a period of time and was not to be used after this unless the
new lease was paid. Normally, these types of programs start printing
Count-Down warnings as the expiration date nears and the customer is
supposed to enter a code (supplied by the vendor after paying for the
extension of the lease) into the program to keep it running. I do not
remember if the program was issuing this type of warning or not. I think
that the court case was due to the way that the vendor crippled it for
non-payment not the fact that it was done (since the Time Bomb code was
standard industry practice and they just logged into the program to cripple
it instead of just having it refuse to run after the trigger date).

The ruckus was also due to CIS's ignoring the need to be able to suppress
access to newsgroups based on the user's Gateway node. If this ability had
been designed into the code before it was released, then the German users
could have been isolated [without affecting non-German Users] just as fast
as the newsgroups were flagged as "Invisible" for display to German
Gateways (the current CIS support requires the user to select from a CIS
Generated and Supplied list so the list could not display certain NG's
names [given the support for this capability]). This need to suppress
access to German Users did not suddenly become a requirement with this
incident since CIS was on notice for at least 2 years that the German
Government felt they were entitled to censor what was supplied by CIS to
German Users (that time it was due to a game that used the Swastika). Given
this precedence, it would seem to be obvious that there would be the need
to tailor the listings based on "Community Standards" (since the German
Government is touchy about access to certain types of material such as
Revisionism and the Holocaust). In fact, given their laws and mindset, I
find it odd that neither of the following were on their list of newsgroups

This reminds me of a Science Fiction story by H. Beam Piper called "A
Planet for Texans" where as part of the laws of the planet (and the oath of
office) was a statement that the politician was representing the interests
of ALL of their constituents. Every constituent had the legal right (and
duty) to register any protests of the politician's actions _in-person_ with
said politician. Such protest could take any form up-to-and-including
killing the SOB on the spot. In the story, this right was illustrated by a
small farmer being charged will killing a Senator by hacking him to death
with a machete (all legal protests are required to be registered in person
and use of long range techniques such as car-bombs or snipping with rifles
is not regarded as a valid protest) and we are shown his trial. The charge
is not killing the Senator (which is by law the farmer's right since he
felt that the Senator was violating his oath of office by misrepresenting
him) but whether, in exercising this right, he used excessive force out of
proportion to the actions that was being protested.

Is this "less likely to report spousal beatings" or "less likely to HAVE
spousal beatings TO REPORT"? - If the former than again it is due to having
a mindset that says that it is ok to beat your spouse (or be beaten by
him/her) while if it is the later then that is a positive aspect of their
Again mindset - if you follow the rules and be a good boy/girl you will be
rewarded after your death. Killing yourself is a "bad" thing and against

Power to steal money from me (via "taxes" such as FICA) claiming that I am

obligation to supply these services under the promised terms when I
need/want them. If SS and Medicare were run by a private company and
operated the way the Government changes the rules, all of Top Management
would be in Prison for Fraud (and a number of other charges). Any Benefits
program that the Government uses its coercive power to force me to join and
pay for should be REQUIRED to maintain the terms in place when the payments
were collected (ie: There should be no unilateral alteration of the terms
by the Government). The ONLY program that I can think of where this has
even partly occurred is with IRAs (all payments prior to year X are treated
under the original tax rules while payments into an IRA after that date
have a new tax status). All other programs are subject to rules
modification (ie: reductions of promised/paid-for Benefits) or Congress
defunding at a moments notice.

@_subject: Twenty Bank Robbers -- Game theory:) [Classic Answer] 
This is a variant on the normal distribution problem/game where you have a
number of homogeneous/identical items that are either too numerous to
distribute by the "one for you and one for me" method or are not equivalent
to each other. The "goal" is to have a method of distributing so that each
person feels that they got "their fair share". The classic solution is to
have  divide the items into 20 piles (any of which he is willing to take
as his share). Then number  is offered the choice of accepting distribution or rearranging the distribution until he is happy to accept
any of them. This accept/rearrange process goes on until  has made his
decision. Then  is allowed to select any one pile as his share. The
"choose a pile" option then goes back up the line (to   etc) with
each taking one of the remaining piles until it gets to whoever was before
the person who did the last rearrangement. This person then has the option
of doing a new rearrangement or approving the current distribution. After
he does a rearrangement or approves the distribution, the option keeps
going up the line until it gets to  (who selects a pile). You then keep
going down [and up] the line until there are only two piles and the last
approver/rearranger gets the last pile after the choice of piles is made by
the other person.
This is "fair" since at all times the person who is making a pile selection
has already approved the distribution (or at the end is offered his choice
of the two remaining piles).

accept any offer from  that is for at least 50% [anything less he
should/could reject since  will/should offer him at least 50% to prevent

Also, I question WHO  should offer the split to. All he wants is 9 extra
votes so it does not need to be  I'd think that  (if  wants
part of the money) or  (if he does not but wants to hedge his bet by
allowing for one "No" vote from that group) would be better since by voting
"YES", each gets to not need to worry about coming up with a split or
risking death (11-20 do not have this type of immediate threat hanging over
their heads so they are more likely to vote "NO" and hope for a better deal
[as the first ones start dropping dead, there are less votes needed so the
"I'll Bribe you with part of the Split" offers are going to be worth more
to those who are included]).

I've read the differing scenarios and they seem to fall into two groups -
Either  makes an offer good enough to get 9 others to vote for it (and
thus save his life) or there is a blood bath ending with  getting all
the money and  with nothing but his life.
I think that if the blood bath occurs it will not get to the 2 survivor
stage. I think it will end at the 4 (or possibly 3) survivor stage. I base
this analysis on  best outcomes and interests. He will survive no
matter what (assuming that we ignore the cases where those who do not get
their fair share wack those who got money and take it) so this is not an
issue for him (he has no way of being killed for being too greedy). The
amount of money that he will get is totally dependent on what the current
"split proposer" offers him as an incentive to vote for the split (as
noted, once  gets to the top of the queue, he can [will?] grab
everything and cut out  so it is in  financial interest to vote for
a prior robber who will offer him some of the money). Since the vote must
be 50% or better for the proposed split, once it is  chance (ie: When
we are down to only 4 robbers and 2 yes votes will "win"), he can get vote by offering him at least 50% of the money (more than 50% will be an
incentive to  to take the deal since if he goes thumbs down to a 50/50
split with   will only need to offer  the same 50/50 deal ["its
then 50% or nothing"] after  gets killed).  can hedge his bet by
offering  some of the rest (assuming a secret vote or all voting at the
same time in ignorance of how the other voted) since it might gain his vote
(a split between 17&20 leaves  out in the cold so he might go for some
money as opposed to none [in the case where  goes for 17&20 split]).

If the message is split into more than one part (to meet the message size

requesting all three parts of a 3 part message (or 2+1). If a record is

This can also affect the "attack" I speculated on above since it can "leak"
