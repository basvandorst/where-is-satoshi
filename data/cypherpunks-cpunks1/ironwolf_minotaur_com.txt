@_subject: CYPHERPUNK considered harmful. 
Recently Peter Trei  called for new names and slogans to
replace the negatively loaded name "Cypherpunks." Here is one effort
(partially based on his suggestion, but with refinements.) Note that I
intend the term "strong privacy" to include both cryptography-based tools,
and other tools such as remailers. I hereby place the following into the
public domain.
* * *
I lock my car.
I secure my house.
I send my letters in envelopes.
I store my valuables in safe places.
I don't let strangers hold my wallet.
I don't wear a name tag everywhere I go.
I carry my cash and credit cards out of sight.
I don't show off my key number when visiting the ATM.
I protect my e-mail and files with strong privacy tools.
Don't you?
