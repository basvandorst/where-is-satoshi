 Everybody knows that Al Gore is hot on this "National Information
 Infrastructure" thing.  What many people may not fully appreciate --
 or at least, what I'm just discovering myself -- is the sheer enormity
 of the disaster going on as we speak, under the banner of the
 "Information Infrastructure Task Force" (IITF).  If you haven't
 already done so, I highly recommend an enlightening browse on the
 iitf.doc.gov site (ftp & gopher at standard ports, http at port 70).

 Although I've barely scratched the surface, I've already run across a
 number of items which might be of interest to folks here.  The DOE,
 for instance, reports that they are working on
         "Developing electronic cash systems that would maintain
         the privacy of individuals from merchants and banks, but
         would allow law enforcement to trace the flow of the
         electronic cash, given proper court orders."
 Other spectacularly dubious achievements include the report of the
 Privacy Working Group, which never once acknowledges any individual
 right to privacy, and in fact devotes most of their report to various
 ways to increase the "willingness" of the public to divulge personal
 data; and the draft report of the Intellectual Property Working Group,
 which with a straight face characterizes most current Internet
 activity as illegal, and then goes on to outlaw the rest of it, while
 blandly noting that the public will require "education" in these
 matters.  Also, of course, there are any number of hints of NII
 projects involving various intelligence agencies.
 Enjoy.

@_subject: Ecash mailing list? 
Hello all,
Is anybody interested in forming a mailing list explicitly for e-cash
discussion?  After looking at the c'punks list for at least a year,
there seems to be the critical mass of interest to create a medium
volume mailing list.
The most critical benefit that such a dedicated list would have is
that we could probably generate interest from parties who may have
an interest in alternate currency/cash systems but have no interest/
knowledge of crypto (a lot of hard core financiers that I know of
come to mind...).
I don't have the resources to create a list but I'd be more than glad to help out someone who has access to 'em.

(I think it was at one of his High Performance Networks Conferences) where
he said that the big administrative headache for high speed networks vs.
low speed networks was simply the speed with which you could get in trouble.....  The analogy holds quite true in physical credit cards vs.
net credit....
