First, I gotta say.. only been back on the list a day or two and the Signal to Noise seems to have gotten nearly out of hand.. I don't know what cypherpunks has to do with trying to listen in on cordless phone calls, or how to give someone drugs.. but anyway.. something on topic.. :)
I wrote a UDP based encrypted chat program a while back.. it worked well, but I saw the following drawbacks..
1) It used secret keys that had to be shared beforehand through a prior secure channel.
2) Being UDP based, I was forced to operate the ciphers in ECB instead of CBC mode, just in case any of the packets got lost.
To make the application more robust, I have started rewriting it to use TCP instead.  It is still a peer-peer network, requiring no dedicated servers.. while this increases overhead somewhat, I think it's worth it to keep the system from relying on one particular server, or a group of them.  You simply add the IP of the people you want to receive your messages to your list.  If someone adds you, when you receive a message from them, it adds them to your list automatically.  Downside is currently that everyone must maintain an active TCP connection to everyone else.. but it's not meant to be a replacement for IRC or anything like that, just a secure way to chat and transfer other data such as files or voice.
I have also decided to get rid of the key sharing mechanism, and instead utilize D/H to generate a KEK, then transfer a 4096bit data block from the initiating client to the serving client (I'll refer to them as C/S where their role is appropriate, but keep in mind there is no real "server".. much like gnutella or similar systems, every client is a server, and every server a client.) to serve as a master key.  The first N bits are used depending on which cipher is negotiated/selected, up to the max supported by my implementation of each cipher.
Now, my main question about D/H is quite simple.. what is considered a "good" size for the prime and primitive used, in bits?  Obviously something somewhat large, but how large is large enough?  64bits?  Less or more?  I can't find much information on this anywhere, and my copy of Applied Cryptography (2nd ed.) while covering D/H in detail, doesn't even mention this.
An aside is that I'm writing the application in Delphi 5, and the maximum native supported integer sizes are 32bit unsigned, and 64bit signed.. I've been writing a math library of my own in assembler that at compile time will allow you to specify the maximum bitsize you want it to support, but this is proving to be a mind-numbing task.. ;)  If anyone is familiar with Delphi and has any libraries like this already, I'd much appreciate hearing about them.. or even some a web resource or paper Real Book (tm) resource that explains in abstract terms how to go about something like this would be appreciated.
I had more to write.. but I'm exhausted.. fun crypting to everyone.. ;)

I figured it would be something of that nature.. hence the math library I was working on.. :)
Thanks for the link...
Ah.. I have implemented a sieve of eros..whatever his name is.. ;)  for finding smaller primes.. it runs very fast, the old rules don't apply so much anymore, memory footprint being more a concern then speed I've noticed so far.. moving the found primes into a sparse array as you find them and then reusing the memory is one way around that.. even my quickly written implementation takes negligible time to find all the primes within 16 bits.. but I've been looking at rabin-miller and some other methods as well.  I'll take a look at that link, thanks.. reason again for the math library.. my stuff (obviously) falls apart > 32bits since my library for handling larger numbers is unfinished.
Ah cool.. I've heard very good things about GMP and had been thinking about ways to implement it.. could solve all my problems in one fell swoop. :)  I (for reasons that should be obvious) felt that writing the routines myself (with extensive testing) would be preferable, so I could avoid licensing issues as well as bugs/backdoors, but I'll look into this..  Thanks for the quick response.. the application will of course be available to anyone who wants it once finished.. and once Borland finishes Kylix, should compile nicely on the various x86 *nixes out there..

Hah yeah that spelling looks right.. it's really pretty elegant, and was considered at the time of the writing of AC 2nd ed. to be faster for numbers of 100 digits or less.. since a base-10 digit is roughly 3.5 bits, that should be faster than say the general number sieve for numbers up to about 350 bits.
It works by first making an array of bits, all set to true, that represent all the numbers from 2 - X, where X is the last number you want to test for primeness.  You loop through the array from begining to end.. for each bit you find set, you set all multiples of that number up to X off.  This results in every multiple of every prime (which is to say, every composite number) being marked "false" in the array.  When finished, you have an array of bits where an on bit represents a prime.  The storage issue results because I currently store an array of bytes instead of an array of bits.. so to test the first ~ 16 million numbers (24 bits) requires about 16 meg of storage.  That would drop to 2 meg if I rewrote it to be a bit-array, which I intend to do.. and it would only take N bytes of memory if instead implemented as a sparse array of bytes, where N = the number of primes from start to finish of your range.
Probably would slow down some around 512bits.. which should represent numbers about 147 base-10 digits.
I expect it'll be easier when I look at it again.. it still looks a bit messy though.  AC 2nd ed describes rabin-miller as follows, p260, pp2..
(p = prime)
1. Calculate b, where b is the number of times that 2 divides into p - 1.
2. Calculate m, such that p = 1 + 2^b * m.
3. Choose a random number "a" such that "a" is less than "p".
4. Set j = 0 and set z = a^m mod p.
5. if z = 1, or z = p - 1, then p passes and may be prime.
6. if j > 0 and z = 1, then p is not prime.
7. set j = j + 1.  If j < b and z != p - 1, set z = z^2 mod p, and go back to 6.  If z = p - 1, then p passes the test and may be prime.
8. If j = b, and z != p - 1, then p is not prime.
I think I need to just be a bit less tired before I can parse that efficiently into code.. :)
Do you mean calculate each product of two of the first 1000 primes?  (i.e. 2*3, 2*5, 2*7... 5*7...) etc? for each possible pair?
Yeah.. hadn't decided if I was going to open source it or not.. but I suppose putting it under the GPL myself does prevent anyone else from making money off my work.. ;)  I'm not looking to make any money from this product, but I certainly don't want anyone else making money off my hard work either.  I need to read the GPL or GLPL closely.. whichever GMP is under.
Cool.. thanks for the help and links again.. tried to sleep for the past two or three hours, couldn't.. I'm back up and at it. ;)

Right.. I consider the benefits to outweigh the costs.  I am keeping the protocol robust enough that if you wanted to implement a server on your own, you could probably do so with minimal impact to the clients themselves.  When finished, you'll be able to add servers just as you do other users to your "buddy list" if you will, and communicate with a larger group that way.  Inter-server communications is not restricted either, but it's a ways down the road.
Yes.. I understand the differences in TCP/UDP pretty well, and their strengths and weaknesses.  I've done extensive programming using both, and have decided to go with TCP.  I do however have two points to bring up with the beginning of this section of your reply.
1) I've never encountered the 20 socket limit on any OS in recent memory.. and many applications open more than this on a regular basis.
2) The target audience of this application is very small, and currently restricted to Win32 users because it is written in Delphi.  Before long Delphi will be available for Linux, and cross-compiler compatability will have to be tested, but it is a big selling point with Borland/Inprise.  When Kylix (Delphi/C++ Builder on Linux) is available, I am keeping my fingers crossed that it will run well on FreeBSD, since I refuse to touch Linux with a ten foot pole, but have several years experience not only with Delphi, but with Administration of FreeBSD as well as NT based boxes.
I agree that voice using TCP has the drawbacks that you mentioned, however, because of the other existing requirements such as CBC and File Transfer, it is required that you have a reliable connection to get even the basic functionality of the program to work.  I'd rather have a delay in hearing the voice messages until the packets have arrived than decrease their security by using ECB.
CBC does self recover yes, if bits are flipped that should not be flipped.  According to AC, a one bit error will cause a corresponding 1bit error, as well as mangling the following block.. but subsequent blocks will be OK.  However, it states very clearly that receiving the wrong number of bits in the stream will destroy the rest of the stream beyond repair for the decryption end, and that makes sense.  If a UDP packet is lost, then the rest of the stream is screwed and must be reinitialized.  Since the only way around this problem (besides using EBC) is to write my own connection-handling on top of UDP; I instead choose to let the OS handle this for me, in the form of TCP.
To quote Applied Cryptography, 2nd edition..
p195, pp5
"In CBC mode, a single-bit error in the ciphertext affects one block and one bit of the recovered plaintext.  The block containing the error is completely garbled.  The subsequent block has a 1-bit error in the same bit position as the error."
p196, pp2
"While CBC mode recovers quickly from bit errors, it doesn't recover at all from synchronization errors.  If a bit is added or lost from the ciphertext stream, then all subsequent bits are shifted one bit out of position and decryption will generate garbage indefinitely."
I assume that losing an entire block worth of bits will cause as much havoc as losing just one bit would.  If that isn't correct, I'd like to hear it..
The D/H is going to be used just to generate a key to securely transfer a 4096 bit key for use in symmetrical crypto routines later in the program, for actual encryption of the chat/voice/file data transfers.  Using 1024 bits of D/H is fine to generate a key-encryption key to just transfer the 4096bit key.  I chose 4096 because it's large enough to be used in any symmetric crypto algorithm to max out it's key length.
Of course. ;)
Well, truth be told, everyone knows that there is the problem "If Mallory is God.." which in this world simply means, if Mallory is your upstream you're in some serious trouble.  He could just as easily intercept the PGP keys and replace them with his own if they didn't already exist on the server.. this would cause problems for keys signed outside mallorys realm, say if you could distribute your key outside his available channels... however, if you could do that, you could just as easily trade a PRNG and a list of seeds, or even discuss whatever it is you mean to discuss over a cup of coffee.. :)
There comes a point of diminishing returns in trying to defeat the mallorys, where instead of making the problem harder for them, you just replace it with an equally hard/easy problem of a different nature.  I'm as paranoid as the next guy, but if mallory exists (in a given scenario) and he is in a position to intercept/forge a D/H exchange, then chances he is in a position to intercept/forge his own PK are highly likely.
Ah, sorry.. how did we get on the topic of denial of service?
Hey, I tend to find asm totally the opposite of ugly.  I've been writing it for years and have become pretty proficient at it, and my solutions are usually quite fast and elegant.  But, I have found a library I am going to be using instead.. the FGInt library.
Delphi can call C routines no problem, I have two problems with GMP that however have nothing to do with Delphi..
First, It's GPL'd, or under a modified version of the GPL.  I find the GPL to be distasteful and it forms a barrier more than a bridge to continued software development.  The reason for this I think is pretty simple; the GPL (I refer to the classic GPL.. I am not sure of modifications to it that may have been made for it's application to GMP) has made it excruciatingly clear that any program or library using any GPL'd source code must itself be open source, and cannot be sold for profit, but only "at-cost".  This represents a very "scary" proposition to professional developers such as myself, who are used to being paid for our work, since it basically states that any person can just come along, take a copy of our source code (which may in and of itself contain anything analogous to a "trade secret"), modify it and release it under a different name.  It also bars me from ever releasing a for-pay version or revision of the software based on GPL'd code.  I'm not in the support business, and any examination of the stock market would make it pretty obvious that those companies that claim they are in that business aren't doing so well.
I much prefer the BSD license which allows you to take, modify and use the source code within, and sell it or distribute it without source code if you so choose, provided you include the existing copyright for the sections of code you have used.  It gives the developer more freedom over how to distribute his/her own code, and incidentally allows people like myself who aren't in the support business and don't want to be the freedom to continue paying the bills by doing development on our own terms.
Sorry for the rant.. I'm a big fan of the Free Software movement, as well as the Open Source movements.. I am however mature enough to realize that there are situations when either one may be inappropriate, and I'm a far bigger fan of freedom than I am of free/open.  I believe that if you want to make your source code open and free, then you do so without restrictions.
Ah, but that really detracts from the joy of a lot of it.. :)  The only parts I'd steal would be parts that I'm finding difficult to do, like the large math libraries.. and that takes all the fun out of learning for yourself.. :)  Far from inventing the wheel though, I will use libraries/snippets that stand up to my testing as well as my scrutiny of their license.. I want to get a version working now (without gpl-like restrictions) and then I probably will go back and rewrite every line myself that I have obtained elsewhere, just so I know how it all works, I am free of licensing restrictions, and I can implement bug fixes/features without worrying about maybe breaking something I didn't write.  You know how difficult it can be to understand code written by other people, I'm sure.. ;)
I'll try and continue. ;)
hahah.. of course.. well, again, sorry for ranting above a bit and possibly contributing some to the noise.. I'll be around, but for now, there is another window open with code crying out to be written... ;)
Take it easy.

I've thought about it and it's definitely something to keep in mind.. another advantage to doing TCP from my standpoint is that it's easier to multithread.  The old version had some problems where on occasion it would stall for a while if it was doing a reverse lookup or something like that, and you wouldn't receive any more traffic until whatever operation was finished.  Threading the application allows any of the connections to stall or slow down without taking the rest of the application with it.. and threading UDP isn't nearly as easy.  Honestly, with the tools I have available, I don't even know if it's possible. :)
Ah ok.. so losing a block will just nuke the entire next block, and then it will recover?  I thought it would be a more serious problem than that, but I guess it makes sense that the feedforward wouldn't be able to affect any blocks beyond the immdiate next block.  Keeping the packets aligned on block boundaries makes so much sense that it's something I'm doing anyway regardless of this problem. :)
Well, the information I have is that Blowfish takes up to 448 bits, RC2 up to 1024 bits, Mars up to 1248bits, RC5 and RC6 both up to 2048 bits of key material.. is that incorrect?
The system currently supports Blowfish, Cast (128 and 256), Gost, IDEA, Mars, Misty1, RC (2, 5 and 6), Rijndael and Twofish for ciphers, and Haval, RipeMD160 and SHA1 for hashes.  The user chooses what cipher they want to communicate to the other users with, so incoming traffic can possibly use a different cipher on every connection, while outgoing traffic will all use the same cipher.
This brings up another question.  My document states that Cast256, IDEA(*), Mars, Misty1(*), RC5, and RC6 are all patented.. * = "Free for noncommercial use."  Is there a good repository somewhere with information on all the licensing issues/rules of these algorithms?
True, and it is something that I've considered, but I would really like to stay away from any kind of server-based options as possible.  The fewer points of failure in the chain the better for this application.  I think it would suit me better to implement a public-key algorithm in the application itself, and then have each client maintain a list of all the public keys it has seen and allow the option to the user of signing them with it's own key and then sending them back to the owner.  This would allow the same failure-rate where only one transmission needs to occur untampered in order to allow for key validation.  Possibly in the future clients could exchange all their keys and then raise the trust level of a public key the more times they see it from different clients.  Since participation is entirely voluntary by both parties in both the overall application as well as the key signing/trust parts, then a DoS related to a single user forging a key and then connecting to many clients with many other clients isn't really an issue.  The lack of centralized communications means that the malicious user isn't going to have a "master list" to poison, or even an accurate view of all the clients in use.
This is all tenative however.. I haven't thought this far ahead until just now.  For now, I just want to get the D/H working and the key generation Ah, as an aside to something you mentioned before about using the built-in random functions with Delphi... Borland gives you full source to all the run-time libraries and components that ship with the language, so It's easy enough for me to just rewrite them to be cryptographically strong if I want to do that instead of writing auxiliary libraries.. why I would want to do that however, escapes me just now, but at least I can investigate the methods it is using and see how strong/weak they are.
Ah ok..
Ah ok, well I'm no lawyer.. I did look at the GMP license and it still appeared to be worded rather strangely.  If the library is linked in to your code then your code must also be open source.  If the library is instead loaded at runtime and also is not required for the application to function, it appears the rest of the source can be closed.. I refer to section 6, and section 7 subsection 1.
However it's worded, I've found a different math library who's only restriction is that if I decided to charge money for whatever I've written with it, I have to pay the author of the library an amount equal to the cost of one license for the application.  A lot more straightforward, and appealing than the legalese of the (L)GPL.
See ya 'round.

Last I checked the remailers allowed return mail to be sent through them, to the owner of the anonymous account.. isn't that the point?  It's easy enough to forge the email header that I can't believe they exist just to totally isolate anyone from the responses.. how would someone using a remailer even join the list (to receive messages) if that was the point?
The only part where I see this being useful is if somebody has some kind of anonymous announcement to make, where they don't intend to join the list.
I can't see the -C-P- subject as really being functional for sorting out spam mail because anyone new to the list won't know to put them in, nor the people I mentioned who might wish to make anonymous announcements.
The benefits of having the list open to unsubscribed postings seem far outweighed by the cost in time spent by everyone filtering messages and server resources that could be better spent running dnetc if nothing else ;). It's just auxiliary that I've never seen an anonymous post to the list in the past when I subscribed, nor more recently since I resubscribed.  Undoubtedly some smartass will send an anonymous message to the list now just to say "see!" :P
There has to be some way around this that will still preserve anonymity, although one doesn't seem readily apparent unless the anonymous party subscribes under their pseudonym.
What about just creating another list (closed-posting) and then just allowing people to choose which to subscribe to?  Obviously, the open-posting list would be subscribed to the closed posting list, but not the other way around.. so at the risk of missing the massively important anonymous message that has yet to be sent, I could eliminate some of this spam?

As I said, how about this:  If YOU don't like seeing MY email, then why don't YOU apply the same rules YOU apply to spam to IT?
Apparently you have no fucking problem whatsoever with filtering out the great deal of spam that comes from this list, whats a few more messages?
First off, let me point THIS out to you...
A search on excite for +cypherpunks +list turns up a great deal of sites...
The first site, "VERONA cypherpunks archives" has a link called "List Information", which goes nowhere.
The second site, obscura.com has several links but no mention of the list The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth sites, the cypherpunks hyperarchive at inet-one.com, has a copy of an email message DIRECTED AT THE TOAD.COM ADDRESS that comes up first in the search, followed by some The SEVENTH site is homeport.org, and the first link on the site is to "The Cypherpunks Homepage" pointing to an FTP archive at berkeley, and has a link to the mailing list.  This link specifically tells you TO use the toad.com address.
So who is being ignorant exactly?  You go to a page claiming to be the "Cypherpunks Homepage" and it says the mailing list is Why don't you blame the asshole responsible for that site before blaming people who did their due diligence and turned up toad.com again and again?  As it happens, this "homepage" makes no mention whatsoever about the other filtered lists.. not that I didn't know about Coderpunks or the others, but if you don't know, they aren't easy to just "bump into."  This berkeley.edu site is the only site I've run across ever claiming to be "The Homepage" and I believe it to be the closest thing there is to one.  So, kindly, shove it.
ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/mailing_list/index.html is the site and page I am talking about.
But, on a related note...

You keep sending to it yourself.  Mind explaining what the problem is?
Exactly my point.
I did rather mean pseudo-anonymous remailer, and the other response indicating I was talking about Julfs' remailer was correct.  It's not as though his was the only one that existed either, just the most popular.. likely among the most popular BECAUSE it kept this database and allowed responses; If the database it was using had been encrypted with a key known only to the remailer software itself, then it would have been easier for him to refuse to give up the information that he was ordered to produce.
As for my being naive as you claim in a second here, who is really being naive here?  You think that just because the remailer doesn't maintain an active database of nym mappings that it's immdiately impossible for it to be reversed?  You implicitly trust anyone who says "here, use my remailer, I guarantee it's anonymous?"  Get with the program.  One fucking line on a console, in a firewall rule, anywhere along the way could fuck you into losing your anonymity, unless the message was sent encrypted to the remailer, and that's just to start with.
I think that using a forged header is just as reliable as using an anonymous remailer, and just as anonymous if done right.  There is no "port 25" hack involved.  It's as simple as setting whatever email software you use to use X as it's smtp server, and then entering a nonexistant return address somewhere else.  At best, you'll be totally anonymous.  At worst, as is the case with any remailer, some log somewhere could exist that a connection to the server took place from w.x.y.z and may even contain the to and from addresses used.  In general though, sysadmins are very stupid, and seldom go to the trouble of logging this kind of information for successful email messages.. typically only failures are logged.
So what is more naive?  To assume the fact so plainly evident in everyones face that the vast majority of sysadmins out there are lazy and stupid and then just pick one at random and do as I suggested, or to pick one of the "anonymous remailers" that make an outright claim to be anonymous, but that you have no way of verifying?  One sounds like a shot in the dark with a very good chance at hitting something, the other one sounds like an ideal trap.
On another note, if you're clued in enough to even know what an anonymous remailer is, where they can be found, and how to use them, I'm sure that "A port 25 hack" as you oh-so inaccurately put it would be something easy for you to do as well.
I made a suggestion.  You people that responded so caustically maybe are tired of hearing the same suggestion over and over again.  I'm tired of getting spam that wastes my time, my bandwidth, space on my mail server, and any other number of various and sundry resources.
If I "whine" about getting spam... well so be it.  Just know that you all whine about my messages, with far more useless messages, and far less reason to be at all upset.
Who are the real whiners here?

My mistake, I misread.  I thought you were asking how many anonymous-remailed messages I had seen to the list.  I would still group that as "a small handful" which was my point; That these messages don't come all that often, and the benefits of allowing them when they do come seem outweighed by the sheer volume of spam.
As for how many I have seen with reply blocks.. in the recent history (since I resubscribed to the list) I haven't seen any... nor any anonymous messages at all save the one smartass I predicted.  In the old days when I was on the list, which was before Julfs' remailer disappeared, they came a bit more often.. but still their frequency was quite low.
alpha.c2.org, which was shut down in '97.
See above.
Wait, I have a better idea.  Jump to conclusions and make inaccurate statements based on preconceptions.  While you're at it, throw in a good dose of the holier-than-thou attitude because you're obviously so fucking special.  Wait, you've already got this suggestion nailed.
(To answer your rhetorical question before you ask it; "Do you know who I am?!" Yes.  Do I give two shits?  Not a fucking chance in hell.  All the history in the world cannot excuse such utterly lame-dicked behavior.)
I think it's a reasonable SUGGESTION.  It was hardly a call to action.  It was simply one suggestion, of several, to try and cut down on the spam.  I suppose you're opposed to that though, and probably read each spam message you get with a keen eye because everybody deserves to be heard, even the As much as you'd like to believe that, no.  I've been involved with cryptography for quite some time.  Not being in your elitist inner-circle, as amazing as that may sound.  Wow!
Who's us?  You an the other loudmouth?
Poor baby.
I'd rather not.  Plenty of work done since '92.
Sorry to have made the slightest suggestion that something be done about the spam, you obviously love reading it so much that you felt the need to attack me because maybe then you wouldn't be able to read it anymore!
A friend of mine brings up a good point, and judging by your hostility, I find it entirely plausable.  Maybe in your pathetic self-centered world you've found the list to be a perfect target for spam, and all this crap is generated by yourself.. would explain why you're so opposed to stopping it.
Why don't you apply your time to something constructive?  I haven't seen a single suggestion out of your mouth, ass, or any other orifice that in the slightest bit may have helped the situation.  Welcome to the I'm sure I'm not the first nor last person to add you to it.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Re: -C-P- Re: would it be so much to ask.. 
I do understand how both types work, however, the opportunity for subterfuge is always present. I was making a point that the assumed security of a remailer should not factor in if you intend to put yourself at risk.  Assumptions are dangerous all over the place, and if your assumption could get you into trouble, it's better to verify it or not instead of just proceeding blindly, if at all possible.
What is the outrageous claim?  That someone could purposely set up an insecure remailer, claim that it's secure, and that people could then unwittingly use it to incriminate themselves?
As for Sendmail, you are correct; Sendmail defaults to a log level of nine, but it's utterly admin configurable, and with successful messages logs the delivery as successful.  This setting is also only present in the default configuration if you get the tarball from sendmail.  Options vary by OS vendor, and loglevels may be different (by default) on a newly installed OS that ships with sendmail (most unix variants, if not all, do) or if sendmail was installed via a package distribution method.
This could go on and on, but it's twisting the point I was making a great deal and turning the argument away from the topic that started it.  I'm not debating the relative merits of remailers, I know they serve a need that cannot be duplicated with great ease, and honestly my comment about faking the return addresses was in no way to say that this method could replace remailers; I was just pointing out that it is a far stretch of the imagination to call it "port 25 hacking" or whatever Tim said.
I'm going to stop myself here.. The original email I sent was simply a question about what could be done to possibly quell the flow of spam generated by this list, followed by a few suggestions.  It's gotten utterly out of hand because somebody apparently took it as a personal attack, and responded with a series of attacks of his own.
As I said before, if [you] (the reader on the list) don't want to hear these questions, then what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  Filter my emails if you like; It'll be a lot easier for you to filter them automatically than it will be to filter the spam messages in any event.
I agree they are not easier to find than just trusting the word of someone that a particular remailer is secure, but in my opinion that is ass backwards.  Trust should be a lot harder to earn than simply doing a little legwork.  You suggested finding a remailer in a country unfriendly with the one that is likely to come after you for posting whatever you wish to post, so that it will be harder for law enforcement to pry any information out of the hands of the remailer operator; I find the same logic applies to doing the header forging.  If you're in the US as in your example, using an smtp server in Iraq (for example) to send your email through is a pretty safe bet that even if it logs every line of the file including the message body, that the chances of them cooperating one iota with the authorities is pretty small.
Just as a preamble here, I'll say flat-out that I totally understand the need some people have for anonymous remailers.
That said, I have not personally had occasion to use one yet, or need to.  I have been in situations where anonymity would have possibly been desirable to some, but more often then not I have chosen to simply waive any kind of real anonymity, and just get out there with what I was doing.
I used to run a very large site critical of the CoS, and I kept -everything- online.  My domain name records were forged, and I didn't go out of my way to attach my actual name to anything, but I didn't go to any great lengths to hide it either.  When the CoS found out about it, they sent Ms. Kobrin after me.  She claimed she wanted to send me a hardcopy of their copyrights on the material that I had posted, because I told her if she could prove ownership of any of it, that I would take it down.  I told her that an email copy of the information would be sufficient, and that she should send it straight away.  I even took the material down and gave them two weeks to produce.  When they didn't, I emailed them and put the material back online.  This part repeated, and I repeated my request.
Instead, I received another nasty letter, and then a few days later a call from my upstream provider.  They denied her request to deliver up my name and address, but told me that if I didn't take the information down that it would be a violation of the service agreement, and that they would disconnect the frame relay.  I explained to their (the ISPs) lawyer the situation, and that they did not actually own the copyrights in question.  He responded with "I know, but considering their history, they are very willing to take us to court over this, and honestly we don't want to deal with that.  Take it down or we shut you down, we don't care who's right, we just don't want a lawsuit."
Needless to say, faced with the entire site being removed, I removed the After my diatribe above you ask me to find a server that I *trust* is not doing logging?  In that case I'll trust only those that I admin, so that even in the case that they are doing logging, I can remove the logs myself Finding an open relay first off is easy though..   Finding one that doesn't log, difficult to verify logging or not, so you just look for one run by an entity unlikely to cooperate, as we covered before.
THAT is exactly what I'm talking about.  I wasn't complaining, at least not as loudly as some of the rest.  I was trying to get something -done- and there is a difference.
As far as I'm concerned, if people don't want to hear this again, then THEY can filter or unsubscribe.  I personally like to believe any amount of discussion on this list is more meaningful than the spam, even if it's all been said and done before.
It is an open list after all right?
I see.  But trying to find a way to save even more time and bandwidth by even attempting to figure out a solution to this problem is not as valuable?
It comes down to a simple bit of confusion on my part.  I cannot understand the mentality of someone who has the time and resources to effectively combat the spam on this list, and yet who does not have the time or resource to either respond in a somewhat civil fashion, or to just delete the message along with the rest of the refuse.
You seemed to be a bit more level headed, so while I still totally disagree that it's a waste of time to try and figure a way around this problem, I haven't utterly lost respect for you as I have with Tim.  "Pillar of the community" or not, the guy is an utter asshole.
