@_subject: New PRNG method! 
Hello, All!
I was just thinking about how to generate random numbers,
when I hit upon an interesting idea:
If the internet is so huge and complex, why not, say, use the least significant bits of ping times from random internet hosts as seeds for a PRNG? (Practical Random Number Gen.)
You could then break the resulting binary value into 128-bit
blocks and modulus/xor each with a stream of random numbers taken
from a keyboard timing.
After all this, you could wash it with a secure symmetric cryptosystem such as idea in CBC mode.
Any thoughts, comments?

@_subject: Request Comments: Transpose/XOR Hash 
I'm working on a cipher that utilizes Cipher Block Chaining
and One-way hashing to create a sequence of pseudo-random
numbers to XOR against a plaintext.
I'd like to know if anyone has comments regarding the hash
method I came up with. It is a combination of Transposition
and XORing. Basically, it works like this:
Let's say K is the 8 character key that will be hashed. There are two binary accumulators M and L, which store the
Most and Least significant bits in each byte of K. After M and
L are both 8 bits long, they are XORed together and the resulting value replaces byte N in the Key. This is repeated
8 times, and each time, N is incremented by one.
