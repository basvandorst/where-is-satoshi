@_subject: Encrypted text illegal across US borders? 
I've been told that it is illegal for us to transmit encrypted text to
locations outside the borders of the US (i.e. sending email across the
Atlantic that is encrypted).
Is this true?

@_subject: Hotel locks (was:Radio-activated locks, RESCUE...) 
I've been told that the way that hotel locks work is simple LFSR type
The chip recognizes some key pattern, and generates a sucessor key.
If a card is inserted that doesn't match the primary key, it checks the
sucessor key. If that matches, the successor becomes the primary, and a new
successor is generated.
The machine at the front desk knows where in the sequence the a particular
lock is, and simply generates a sucessor whenever a new key is asked for.
So, there doesn't need to be any communication between the desk and the
lock when a new key is generated. Note that after you get a new key, the
old one will still work until the new key is used.
Note that there is more than one primary key; there are 'master' keys for
the staff, and presumably that can be used to reset the key if the sequence
lost. Of course, who knows what happens if the master sequence get lost to
a battery burp- maybe a separate ID number/lock? (as opposed to the huge
back door of a permanent, single, masterkey...)
Clever little system, yes?

Clipper ain't dead yet:
TECHNICAL MEETING UPDATES - Discussion and work on the following
topics occurred at the meeting: Zoom Video, Thermal Characterization of a
card inside a laptop, Changes to Custom Interfaces, Indirect Access to PC
Card memory, and changes/clarification to the Multifunction specification
(this one was deemed very important).  A presentation was made by Spyrus
on security cards and a proposal to set up a technical working group was
made. ........
2) PC Card Working Group Security Card proposal by Spyrus - wants
security card id to be a part of the standard and supported by system
software.  The government Fortezza card would be included.

@_subject: Random number generator question (& Las Vegas) 
According to a friend who started a company that is going to sell gambling
machines to Las Vegas:
The Nevada Gaming Commission closley regulates the RNGs.  They use Chi
squared tests and others to verify the randomness.  They are not perfect.
Todays slot machines use a Psudo RNG that requires a seed number to make
sure it doesn't short cycle.  They use some time based player input like
coin in or handle pulls to pick a number.  You must discard lots of numbers
or it would be too easy to sync up and predict the answer. (basically
confirming the above)
Nothing is totally immune to tampering.  The gaming commission tries to
make sure the machines are reasonable secure.
