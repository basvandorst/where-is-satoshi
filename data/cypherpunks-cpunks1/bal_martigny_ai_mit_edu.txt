For a good survey paper of knapsack cryptosystems, see [1].
   Third -- and this is what sunk the knapsack problem -- you need a
   cryptosystem that exploits the full NP-complete problem, as opposed
   to just a simple case.  (The knapsack problem was solvable by someone
   who knew the key because it wasn't a general knapsack, but a super-
   increasing sequence -- each number in it was greater than the sum
   of all of its predecessors.  (This was the simplest version; there
   were, I believe, some others.))
Even knapsack cryptosystems that exploit the full NP-complete problem
may still be susceptible to general attacks, depending on their density
(a property of the weights of the knapsack problem).  If the weights
$a_i$ are too large, you get a "low-density knapsack" (i.e. you're
sending lots of bits of cyphertext to hide few bits of plaintext).
Brickell [2] and Lagarias and Odlyzko [3] showed that there are general
attacks against subset-sum problems with density < 0.6463...  In [4] we
showed that this bound can be improved to about 0.9408...  Joux and
Stern came up with essentially the same result at about the same time
[5].  (Note that if your density is > 1, then you have the possibility
of two different plaintexts encrypting to the same ciphertext.  Without
more information, the encryption can be ambiguous.)
We combined our two techniques in a joint paper -- you can get it via
anon. FTP from martigny.ai.mit.edu in pub/bal/sumcc.ps, if you're

   ??  As far as I know, Sun's secure RPC uses Diffie-Hellman with a
   192-bit modulus.  LaMacchia and Odlyzko solved the discrete log problem
   for that size, but there's no single private key to disclose.
The discrete log problem is "brittle" -- you have to do a lot of
precomputation work for any particular modulus, but once you've done
that work finding individual discrete logs is easy.  We had received a
"challenge number" from someone at Sun (i.e. they gave us g^x mod p, and
we had to find x).  We included both numbers in our paper.
Interestingly enough, although Sun used a 192-bit prime, the comments in
the source code refer to p as a 128-bit prime.  Also, g=3 for the Sun
RPC system, and code comments refer to g as a primitive root modulo p.
But 3 isn't a primitive root modulo this particular p.  We suspected
that someone at Sun decided 128 bits was too short, and increased the
length of the modulus to 192 (still too short) without changing the
comments and verifying the primitivity of g.

BACKGROUND: In order to be considered for employment as an MIT campus
police officer, the Department normally requires three years of prior
police experience as a campus, municipal or state police officer.
Finalists for all police positions undergo background checks (including
criminal record checks) prior to hiring.
AUTHORITY: All MIT Campus Police officers are qualified under Chapter
22C Section 63 of the Massachusetts General Laws and have full powers as
police with regard to crimes occurring on MIT property. In addition, all
officers hired on or after December 1, 1987 are sworn as Deputy Sheriffs
in Middlesex County.  MIT police officers do not exercise police
authority in the City of Boston and therefore do not patrol MIT
fraternities, sororities or independent living groups located in Boston.
However, the MIT Police do provide emergency medical services.
WEAPONS: MIT police officers and supervisors are armed and must undergo
annual firearms qualifications based on Massachusetts Criminal Justice
Training Council standards. The Department has written deadly force and
non-lethal force policies which are reviewed with officers on an annual
In addition, they have some control over what gets reported to Cambridge
and state law enforecement authorities.

      I dunno. The paper by LaMacchia and Odlysko on how to break
      Diffie-Hellman quickly once you've done a lot of precomputation on a
      static modulus is sufficiently disturbing to me that I would prefer to
      be able to change modulii fairly frequently if possible.
   Quoting K. McCurley about the above mentioned work: "Their experience
   seems to suggest that it is possible to compute discrete logarithms in
   groups GF(p)^* with p \wavyequals 10^100." [in _The Discrete Logarithm
   Problem_, collected in _Cryptology and Computational Number Theory_]
Right.  Basically, what we found was that you needed the same amount of
computation to factor a (k+10)-digit composite as to compute discrete
logarithms in a field with k-digit modulus p.  The discrete log problem
is brittle---you do a lot of precomputation for a particular modulus p
and then finding individual discrete logs in GF(p) is easy---so you
need to think carefully about the lifetime of the information you're
going to encrypt and choose the size of your modulus accordingly.

Just to clarify, the estimate I give people is that computing discrete
logs in a prime field GF(p) is about as hard as factoring a number 10
digits (33 bits) longer than p.  This estimate is based on the empirical
data Andrew Odlyzko and I collected for 192-bit and 224-bit moduli.  To
the best of my knowledge no one has attempted a discrete log modulus
larger than 224 bits.  (There just haven't been any juicy targets
recently to attack...)
   Although DH and RSA are believed to be of approximately equal
   difficulty given the same number of bits, DH is additionally
   vulnerable because system designers usually publish an "official"
   modulus and primitive root for everyone to use, whereas in RSA,
   everyone has their own key.
This is not a property of D-H key exchange, per se, but of the actual
uses to which people have put the D-H protocol.  Two parties wishing to
generate a shared secret could certainly produce a D-H modulus and
generator on the fly for one-time use, but that takes some time.  The
fact that the discrete log problem is brittle simply means that you have
to choose your modulus taking a few more things into account when using
the D-H protocol for a particular application.
   To mount an attack on PGP, for instance, you must factor a key
   for each person whose privacy you wish to compromise.  Breaking
   Sun's published 192 bit DH modulus instantly broke SunRPC on all
   machines using the protocol.  The latter was a lot less work than    the former.
Breaking SunRPC was a lot less work than breaking a (typical) PGP key
simply because the SunRPC modulus was so small.  If I'm given a choice
of factoring 100 different 512-bit PGP keys (for 100 different users) or
breaking a 768-bit D-H modulus that compromises all 100 users
simultaneously, I'll take the factoring problems.

Date: Wed, 12 Jul 1995 15:28:25 -0400
   Subject: Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act of 1995
   On June 27, Sen. Grassley introduced extensive criminal amendments to the
   federal racketeering act.  S. 974, the "Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act of
   1995," would amend U.S. Code sections 18 USC 1961 (criminal RICO statute),
   18 USC 1030A (new section on computer crime), 18 USC 2515, 2516
   (wiretapping), and 42 USC 2000aa (Privacy Protection Act).
   This proposed legislation is Very Bad. It would make all encryption
   software posted to computer networks that are accessible to foreigners
   illegal *regardless of whether the NSA has classified the software as a
   munition!!!*  Here's the language:
    "Sec. 1030A.  Racketeering-related crimes involving computers
      "(a) It shall be unlawful--
   . . .
       electronic or digital communications to computer networks that the
       person distributing knows, or reasonably should know, is accessible to
       foreign nationals and foreign governments, regardless of whether such
       software has been designated nonexportable."
It's much worse than this.  Look at the definition of "predicate act":
            `(b) For purposes of this section, each act of distributing
          software is considered a separate predicate act. Each instance in
          which nonexportable software is accessed by a foreign government,           an agent of a foreign government, a foreign national, or an agent           of a foreign national, shall be considered as a separate predicate
          act.
Now, since the bill also makes 1030A violations "racketeering
activities", all you need are two predicate acts and RICO comes into
play.  Finally, we begin to see the attack on all forms of un-escrowed
encryption.  The bill provides an affirmable defense of
giving the keys to the government ahead of time!
            `(c) It shall be an affirmative defense to prosecution under this
          section that the software at issue used a universal decoding device
          or program that was provided to the Department of Justice prior to
          the distribution.'.
There are also some nice surprises related to wiretapping evidence
(would allow the gov't. to use the fruits of an illegal wiretap
conducted by a third party if the government didn't know about the
wiretap) and the Privacy Protection Act.

What worries me is the first sentence: "each act of distributing
software is considered a predicate act."  It's not clear to me whether
this applies to (a)(1) unlicensed software or (a)(2) encryption programs
(or perhaps both).  Notice that (a)(1) says "transfer" not "distribute".
Perhaps the act of putting Alleged-RC4 on a FTP site is one act and
mailing a copy to Cypherpunks is another act.  That might be two
distributions and thus two predicate acts.

[I've combined parts of Carl's two recent messages...]
   I believe that the concern about defining predicate acts this way comes
   from the RICO requirement that there be TWO instances of a crime in order
   to pass the test of perpetrating a *pattern of crime* and therefore be
   ranked as a mobster subject to RICO.  My guess is that the intent is that
   from one placement on an FTP server or one posting to a newsgroup, the
   perpetrator of that heinous act will have passed his RICO qualification and
   therefore be subject to having all he owns taken from him.
I agree with Carl here.     The crypto section has no GAK exclusion.  It makes it as illegal to release
   GAKed crypto on a net as PGP.
The proposed 1030A(c) provides a defense to prosecution under 1030A(a).
So if GAKed crypto satisfies 1030A(c) then it can be deployed without
fear of prosecution under 1030A(a).  It might still violate ITAR, of
course, although I suspect any system that satisfies 1030A(c) would be
granted a CJ.

   This isn't escrowed encryption being allowed here.  This is straight giving
   of keys (or a back door) to the gov't.  Even Clipper fails this test.
Why doesn't GAK satisfy this clause?  Clearly if the keys are escrowed
with two Dept. of Justice entities (or if there's only one escrow agent
and it's a DOJ entity) then DOJ will have been provided with sufficient
information to decode any encryted information by themselves.  Certainly commercial escrow systems (such as TIS's CKE[*] system with DRCs
(data recovery centers) and DRFs (data recovery fields)) could fail this
test, since the chosen escrow agents may not be subject to DOJ control.
But I could build a CKE system with an "overriding UI (user identifier)"
that had access to all the keys, and provide that UI to DOJ.  The
"universal decoding device" would then be to go to the DRC, present that
UI and the DRF and recover the desired information.
I don't see how Clipper fails the 1030A(c) test, except possibly for the
fact that the proposed escrow agents were not both within DOJ.  I think
that's a minor point.

   I think that this is a very large mistake. Allow me to explain why.
   La Macchia (sp?) and Odlyzko (sp?) have a very nice result which shows
   that once you've done enough precalculation on a particular modulus,
   you can break any subsequent Diffie-Hellman operation performed on
   that modulus with (for our purposes) no effort. 512 bits is, from what
   I can tell, not far out of the realm of possibility for what someone
   could try to crack with current machines given enough effort.
Perry is correct; allow me to add some details.  The discrete log
problem is "brittle": for a given prime modulus p you have to spend a
lot of effort to calculate the first discrete log modulo p, but
subsequent discrete logs modulo p are easy to find.  Basically, you (a)
do a lot of precomputation to compute discrete logs for a set of
small(-ish) primes, and then (b) you combine these to find the
particular discrete log you're interested in.  For the second (and
subsequent) discrete logs modulo p you only have to do part (b), which
is pretty easy.
Our practical experiences with discrete logs suggests that the effort
required to perform the discrete log precomputations in (a) is slightly
more difficult than factoring a composite of the same size in bits.  In
1990-91 we estimated that performing (a) for a k-bit prime modulus was
about as hard as factoring a k+32-bit composite.  [Recent factoring work
has probably changed this a bit, but it's still a good estimate.]
Finally, remember that if the modulus in your appliation is public and
fixed (as it usually is) then you've got a very tempting target for me
to attack.  Once I do the precomputations I can break/subvert/read any
particular D-H exchange I want for little additional effort.  You have
to consider the amount of effort someone might bring to bear against
your entire system, not only against a particular transaction.  Breaking
a particular 512-bit RSA key might not be worth the effort if it just
gets me your encrypted e-mail (or whatever), but a 512-bit D-H modulus
in a widely deployed system is ripe for attack.
See our paper (available from  for all
the juicy details.

   This is also my understanding, which I got from you in the first
   place.  I take it there have been no dramatic breakthroughs in the
   last few years in the discrete log problem? How heavily has it been
   studied in comparison with factoring?
Factoring has received more attention than discrete log; certainly when
it comes to net-wide computations it's all factoring.  But that's partly
due, I think, to a lack of targets to attack.     Still, requiring support of a fixed modulus for shared public use is
   important to promote a basic level of interoperability. This has its
   risks, but it should be okay *provided* it's a strong prime of
   sufficient strength to preclude the precomputation of the discrete log
   tables by even a highly motivated and resourceful attacker. And as a
   backup the protocol should provide for the optional use of private
   moduli between consenting parties. Sound reasonable?
You definitely should allow any modulus between consenting parties.  As
for what moduli the standard says "must be" (vs. "should be") supported,
I don't know.  Maybe the right thing to do is require conforming
implementations to support a large modulus but include recommended
smaller moduli.  Then Alice can always force Bob to use the large
modulus but, if both agree, they can use something smaller from the
standard or even their own home-grown modulus.

@_subject: Why PICS is the wrong approach 
Um, first, there's nothing in the PICS spec that requires ratings to be
embedded with the content.  PICS labels can be distributed one of three ways:
1) embedded in the content, assuming there's a method of embedding defined
for the particular type of content.  (For HTML, you can put it in a META tag.)
2) sent "along-with" the content as part of the transmission protocol.
(For HTTP, there's a standard by which PICS labels can be sent as RFC-822
headers in the HTTP reply, but no one is using that to the best of my
3) distributed from the third-party label bureau.
Method of distribution is independent of author of the label, too.  It's
perfectly reasonable for the author to distribute labels for his content
via a third-part label bureau, or for an author to embed a label from the
GoodMouseClicking page rating service within his document.
By the way, PICS labels nominally apply to a document named by a particular
URL.  You can elide the URL, I think, if the label is sent along with the
content or embedded within the content, but when you ask a label bureau for
labels you request them by URL.
Second, I don't see how PICS oversimplifies content rating.  If anything, I
would expect complaints that PICS complicates things too much because there
can be an infinite number of rating systems and a human is forced into the
loop to read and evaluate the meaning of any particular rating system.  It
is true that PICS currently only permits rating values to be numbers, but
enough PICS users need non-numeric values that I expect this to be changed
in January at the PICS WG meeting.
It's true that reviewer B cannot affect reviewer A's labels, but B can make
statements about the quality of A's labels, and I can choose (in a more
general trust management environment) to accept labels only from label
authors who are vouched for by some particular vouching service.  So
GoodMouseClicking might say I'm a reliable rater of content in "Bal's
crypto-relevant rating service" but a lousy judge of pages for "Joe's cool
jazz pages rating service."
The Feds obviously believe in "encouraging" self-rating as a means of
defending yourself when they haul you into court, but in general I think
people will tend to defer trust to particular third-party ratings services
that they choose over an author's self-labels.  After all, if I'm looking
for movie reviews the last thing I read is the self-promotion put out by
the distributor; I look for a third-party I know who tends to agree with my
tastes.  Same thing with product reviews (e.g. Consumer Reports) or book
reviews.

   Now, copyright might be another matter.    But you can't copyright an
   algorithm, only specific text in fixed form (ie, the source code).  So this
   would mean you couldn't use the particular code posted to sci.crypt, but
   wouldn't stop anyone from using the algorithm, if they wrote their own code
   (to be safe, without having seen the RSA-copyrighted code, only having the
   algorithm described to them by someone else).   If the source code posted to sci.crypt was in fact a copy of an RSADSI
copyrighted soure code listing, then making copies of that listing is a
copyright violation.  However, copyright protection does not extend to
the underlying algorithm, so unless RSADSI has a patent on the algorithm
the idea is free, and can be reimplemented using a "clean room" or
"Chinese wall" approach.  If the posted source code was *not* a copy of
RSADSI source code but instead produced by disassembling object code
RSADSI's claims are tenuous at best.  RSADSI could conceivably claim
that the disassembled code is a derivative product of their copyrighted
object code, but I think they would have a hard time distinguishing
themselves from the facts in _Sega v. Accolade_.
I fail to see how the legality of "alleged-RC2" is any different than
that of the "alleged-RC4" code which was published last year.

   2. Most advocates for a continued right to use strong crypto have used the
   First Amendment centrally. That is, "encrypted speech is still speech." Any
   demand that speech conform to government standards would run into the basic
   point that Congress is not to make such laws.
   I believe this approach is the strongest one. Even if there are some limits
   on speech (a la the infamous "falsely shouting 'Fire!' in a crowded
   theater" example), this sort of limit does not limit the _form_ of speech.
   (Quibblers may point out other such limits, even some on _form_. For
   example, speech at 95 dB is OK, but "speech" at a jet-engine level of 135
   dB is not. I won't get into such quibbles here.)
IANACLP (Const. Law Prof.), but there is a fundamental difference in
First Amendment analysis between content-related restrictions and "time,
place and manner"-related restrictions.  Laws that prevent me from
shouting over a bullhorn at 3am are an example of the latter; they
operate in a manner neutral to the content of the speech and such
regulations are not subject to as strict scrutiny as content-related
restrictions (such as obscenity laws).  The distinction between content and time/place/manner restrictions is
important.  Whether domestic use of cryptography may be regulated by the
Government may very well turn on whether the Court decides that the
encrypted version of my protected speech is itself protected content or
just a manner of expressing the underlying unencrypted content.  [For
example, Judge Patel recently found that source code was speech for
First Amendment purposes in Bernstein v. US Dept. of State, which
allowed Bernstein's constitutional challenge to the ITAR to proceed.]
A moot court panel on the constitutionality of possible domestic
cryptography restrictions was one of the headline events at CFP '96.  I
would strongly encourage those interested to check out:
which has pointers to all the background briefs and analysis as well as
RealAudio recordings of the oral argument held at CFP.

This quote was from the end of Scott Bradner's recross on March 22.
Here's the excerpt from the trial transcript:
[page 166]
    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And indeed, isn't the whole point
[page 167]
     1           that the very exponential growth and utility of the Internet
     2           occurred precisely because governments kept their hands out
     3           of this and didn't set standards that everybody had to
     4           follow?
     5                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's actually even a little bit
     6           more contorted than that because the governments tried to.      7           The U.S. Government and many other governments attempted to
     8           mandate a particular kind of protocol to be used on worldwide
     9           data networks, and this is the OSI protocol suite.  The U.S.
    10           Government mandated its use within the U.S. Government and
    11           with purchasing material with U.S. funds.  This was mandated
    12           in many European countries and in Canada and many other
    13           places around the world.
    14                    That particular suite of protocols has failed to
    15           achieve market success.  What achieved success was the very
    16           chaos that the Internet is.  The strength of the Internet is
    17           that chaos.  It's the ability to have the forum to innovate.     18           And certainly a strong standards environment fights hard
    19           against innovation.

   Did it move?  I hadn't seen any announcement of this...
No, it hasn't moved, but the server it was running on got "upgraded" and
some things were (or still are) broken.  The e-mail based keyserver and
the older WWW interface were working as of Wed. night.  The new WWW
keyserver code compiles but has some bugs I'm still trying to work out.;
I hope to have it back on-line soon.
Sorry for the problems, folks
