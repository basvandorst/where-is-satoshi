Uh... they back up their *mail* spools?  Yeah, right.

I mistakenly interpreted the original posting as "outgoing only."  Incoming
mail must certainly be saved; however, backing up an outgoing mail spool on
a busy machine is senseless.  By "busy", I mean "that machine which serves
as a mail server".
Outboxes change the situation, but they are not universal.  This brings up an interesting point, namely: where is your email secure?  If
the FBI or security agency of your choice decides to clamp a legal hold upon
the machines upon which you work, they surely wouldn't be so foolish as to
forget about your home machine over that frame-relay or ppp/slip link.  In
such a situation, telling people to use any mailbox at all is useless unless
they encrypt with a relatively secure encryption package, z.B. pgp.
This is a problem, and almost certainly more of a problem than security
agencies demanding your backup tapes.  There's also no way around it; the
only solution is encryption.

Hmm.  Any why *don't* you back up netnews?  For more or less the
same reasons it's not particularly useful to back up outgoing mail
spools; to claim that "most systems do blah blah" is like saying that
"most people like menudo."  I, for one, don't.
"{I/we} run an ISP" is a ubiquitous statement these days;  everybody and his
brother "runs an ISP."  I know a drunken college dropout down the block with
a limping sun 3/50 and two phone lines who prides himself on his ISP.  What is not so common is common sense regarding privacy, ie there is not any real reason to back up an *outgoing* mail spool unless you want security_agency_of_
your_choice to come and root through your exabyte tapes next week.
Now, as I mentioned in a followup, incoming mail is a different matter.  At
some point it loses its meaning, though: mail is mail, and it's all incoming
somewhere.  The only useful alternative is strong encryption of *all* messages, an alternative which solves both the nosy-sysadmin problem as well
as styming the snooping legal beagles.
