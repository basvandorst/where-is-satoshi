@_subject: PGP 5.0b11 feedback / PGP Linux memlock patch 
Here's a patch for PGP 2.6.2 (and 2.6.3i) source which locks all
process pages in memory (will not swap to disk) under Linux if
the user is running with effective root privilege.  You might
consider putting something like this in PGP 5.0.  Also, this
patch should be generalizable to POSIX systems withthe mlockall(2)
function.  If you have any success in generalizing it to POSIX,
please let me know, as I only have access to Linux.
See 'man memlockall' for more info.

That last skit was lame ass -- I like the monkey-boy ones.
No shit.  I've been fighting the 'free-thinking' Linux crowd for weeks
this.  Just because MSFT sucks is no reason for the gov to start this
If MSFT sucks, they should be brought to court on those charges, and not
because everyone in the world was stupid enough to use their OS.
Further, just becuase MSFT sucks is no reason to give the gov the power
to regulate software content.  Jesus christ, get out of my pants.
Yes.  This is not a case of "biting the hand that Fed you."  It is a
of government power to control a free market.  I don't fear Bill Gates,
I fear the gov.
Who will you fear in 20 years?  Linus?  Give me a break.

@_subject: Drivers Licenses 
The data that's stored on most of the cards (credit cards, hotel keys,
gym cards, etc.) are encoded with 5 bits per character.  I believe
that this is also known as Baudot encoding.  You can store somewhere
around 80 characters per track on "normal" cards, and most cards
contain a 1/2" magnetic stripe that can hold 4, 1/8" tracks.  So, I
would estimate that your drivers license would hold a total of about
320 characters on all four tracks with standard encoding techniques.
If you are interested in rendering only individual tracks unreadable,
it can be done.  I have done it by scratching off the magnetic
material as you described.  Of course, all tracks run horizontally
across the card, with track 1 being the track closest to the edge
of the card.  So, if you wanted to destroy track 1, you could scrape
off the 1/8" of the strip closest to the long edge of the license.
Have fun.

Wednesday January 7 10:22 AM EST
FCC Reallocates Lightly Used Television Spectrum
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said
Tuesday it had reallocated lightly used television frequencies for use
by public safety services.
Portions of the spectrum between 746 and 806 megahertz that had carried
channels 60 to 69 will be given over to police and fire departments and
other emergency services. The remainder of the spectrum will be
auctioned off for commercial use.
The reallocation was required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The
FCC had previously announced it would reallocate the lightly used
spectrum in an April, 1997 plan for the transition to digital
FCC chairman William Kennard said on Tuesday the commission would allow
some users of the high channels to continue operations, however.
"While recovery of unused spectrum is an integral part of the FCC plan
for transition from analog to digital television, I am sensitive to the
effects of spectrum recovery on Low Power TV and TV translators,"
Kennard said in a statement.
Such broadcasters may continue operations through the transition to
digital television "as long as they do not cause harmful interference
to primary services," he said.

I have it on good authority that either the plan has been scrapped or that

I'm not so sure about this, Robert.  I've heard the rumor that it is a crime,
but I have also heard that if something is delivered to your box, it is yours
and you are not required to send it back unopened if it is not addressed to
you.  I tend to believe the latter, as it is the side of the story shared by
USPS employees.
It certainly is a federal crime, however, for the indended recipient to get

You may have seen the same TV show I saw on him.  I really enjoyed it.
Is there any evidence that he got (ahem) outside funding for his project?
In the back of my paranoid mind, I wondered that since he was dealing with
elliptic curves and modular arithmetic if...  I mean, how did he pay his
mortgage?  The show implied that he was not doing any real teaching most
of that time, and if no one at the school knew of his work, then where was
the money coming from?

There is one thing that comes to mind that was just a topic covered on
list and that is the use of cellular/wireless/RF/ham for connections to
said machines.
Obviously, this would make seizure more difficult (and perhaps increase
likelyhood of prior warning, if for example, cellular service was
cut off).
I am currently studying some parallels between the established FCC
of ham radio self-regulation vis-a-vis anonymous remailers.  I haven't
drawn up my opinions, as they are still being formed.  I think that this
might be one avenue to look down as there is obviously a type of legal
precident in what is allowed/tolerated under obvious FCC jursidiction,
whereas the jurisdiction over IP is obviously still ambiguous.

Even if the signals can be distributed on par with the distribution
of the data itself?  Could this be a 'meta' application that has not
considered?  Perhaps not, because sigint analysis normally increases an
attacker's intelligence on the subject and doesn't decrease it.
No, I wouldn't either.  Your point here indicates that whereas
privacy was increased through movement, the reverse may be true now or
at least at some future date.  Namely, that entities are (or will be)
tracked by their movement and not simply location.

Jim, I'm forwarding this to the list:
Oh, shit.  Well, it seems as though Compaq has been pulling away from Intel
lately (towards AMD), so perhaps this will be a GoodThing(tm), because
otherwise DEC might turn out to be like Apple, except to die a much, much
slower death.
I think so.  Tim had mentioned that last he heard the Intel/DEC deal was dead.
Perhaps this is what he was talking about.  The thing is, how much about the
Alpha does Intel know, and does this mean yet another round of lawsuits?
I'm afraid that Intel may know enough now to make a 1GHz pentium, which would
probably a ModeratelyBadThing(tm).  I'd much prefer DEC to save mankind and
lead them into the next millenium.
Yep, but for how much longer?  Some elephants never die, and right now it
looks like Intel can once again save MicroSoft's OS by hardware (ironically
via DEC).  NT bloats as the hardware gets faster.
I'll aways have a fondness in my heart for installing RSTS from a TU-10
tapedrive and having to wait almost an hour for it to fall off the spindle
before having to start all over...
