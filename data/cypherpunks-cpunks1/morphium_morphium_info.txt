@_subject: News from my Tor Server raid 
as you may have noticed, 2 days ago I got raided due to ownership of
the Domain wikileaks.de
On the SAME day, a letter of the state attorney was sent to me
(arrived yesterday), stating I can pick my things they raided about 20
months ago, on 1. of april (is that a joke now?) because they (the
state attorney) has lifted the embargo. The raid 20 months ago was due
to "spreading childporn" (running a Tor node).
Just to keep you informed.
