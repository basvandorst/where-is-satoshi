If the mail was a forgery on the local site, a check in the mail

@_subject: Data Haven problems 
While programming my data haven code, I am wondering how to guard against
spamming the data haven parser.  It is trivial to mount a denial of
service attack by repeatedly mailing large files. which will fill up the quota or filesystem of the data haven host, and if you have mail on a root partition, will cause hangs or crashes.
Any ideas on how to guard against mailbombs, and to confirm to the sender
that their files are stored successfully?  Perhaps do a mailing with
a test command that validates the existance of the file, and sends a
reply back wether the file is okay or not, or would this result in a
possible security hole?
As to the code, this will have to be my second rewrite as I am going to
do it in perl code, rather than C...  last rewrite was from a daemon to
a program activated by a .forward file.
Lastly, instead of postage (like a remailer would get), how hard would it
be to implement "rent" where if the "rent" is not paid, and a grace period
has elapsed the file would be trashed.  All this while preserving the
anonymity of the sender and the data haven site.

My problem is not that people will bitch about my DH.  My problem will
be arfholes or yellow journalists uploading K*dd*e p**n to my DH, then
making a long report how I cater to p*dofiles and other evil denezins
that pop from time to time.  Then, I get the police knocking at my

Of course, the DH will be hidden by a good remailer (anon.penet.fi), but
it is trivial to use traffic analysis to find where the DH lies.  Just
monitor traffic from/to the remailer and do a series of store/retrives.
Then for confirmation, forge a mail from the dh site to the remailer with
the password (obtained from sniffing) to yourself.
This is the main reason I haven't worked on this code for so long, as

@_subject: key escrow idea from David Satelin of MIT Lincoln Labs 
Slightly off topic:
I haven't seen this horror of GAK discussed here, but this is (IMHO) as
important as possible abuse by LEA's.
Let's factor the LEA's out for a bit.
The US government gets their mandatory key access, and keeps their keys in
three databases in various locations.
Most foreign powers would pay someone a handsome sum to hand over these
keys.  I would bet that France or Iran would offer a billion dollars to
someone who would turn over the part of the database they preside over.
I bet that France/Iran/etc. would be able to pool together 3 billion
dollars and a nice getaway for the stooges who can grab a tape with the
escrowed keys on it.  Heck, Ames turned traitor for less.  (I am assuming
the keys as small, 1K bytes each... an 8mm Exabyte mammoth tape would be
able to carry 30 million keys.)  Even an "el cheapo" Travan TR3 tape would
be able to snarf 1.6 million keys... and that's a lot of people
Soon, you have the US's whole security structure totally compromised.
Any business transactions, any communications are now subject to tapping
by foreign agents, and all US crypto would be absolutely powerless.  And
you thought ITAR put companies at a disadvantage. US companies would
be stomped on by competition which seems to have the same product just
slightly earlier or slightly more refined, or they would move out of the
US, so they can use strong crypto.
Even if one assumes that the LEA's are incorruptable, there are always
people who are willing to watch their country go down in flames for money.

BB would follow the signal and pop another person with conspiracy.
I have been researching this for a while yet, and have a pretty alpha
reference implementation as well as a mailing list exactly on this topic.
The problem with a RAID 5 data haven is that something needs to be the
controller, to put together and store/retrieve the data.  This controller
is in one point, and can be found out.
What BB could do is smash the controller of the RAID array, then press
charges against several of the "hard drive" owners for conspiracy.
I am working on a list for this topic (dh-l at lists.io.com, subscribe on
majordomo at lists.io.com), but I have had problems with getting a the reply
block correct, most likely due to me being very new to majordomo type
Another problem with this way of a data haven is the way network traffic
gets transfered around.  To have it more anonymous, DC net technology can
be used, but this very hard to implement.
As of now, I am looking for someone who can help me implement a redundant
controller system, so when the DH is contacted, even if the first one if
smashed, the "RAID" stays operable.
Currently, the data haven program just wakes up on input from a .forward
file into its stdin and acts on it.

Pirates still exist.  Even if you can give them something to think about
with a 30/06 bullet at their waterline, there are always small countries
who have navies that can be hired.  They may be small and defenseless
compared to the US navy, but against a basically unarmed oil rig, do have
the ability to sink the rig at their whim.
Its ironic that I am playing Devil's Advocate with data havens, but have
the only working input/output code for one that I know of.  (I have been
having problems with it, so until I work some bugs out I haven't put it
for offer via FTP.)
I think for now try to make something that uses the same technology as a
data haven -- An offsite secure storage server.  Discussed in this list
about a year ago, this uses data haven code, and is equivalent to a
sufferance remailer, but at least these can exist.  The first step is
having them exist overtly first, and having "terms of service", then
working on DC-nets, "RAID" DH's, etc.

I just unplugged the floppy drive power cable, and disabled it in the

they will have is a file called bigrandseed which holds the data in it.
As for case protection, the best thing to do is have a tamper switch which
shuts the box off if opened.
One thing I think I can use this for is making a "lock box" for holding a
PGP key for signing/decrypting stuff.  Attach a keyboard, and on boot,
have the PGP key decrypted into a RAM drive.  Then, have a key switch on
the case and a wrapper on PGP to detect this.  E-mail what you want
signed, turn the key, and it emails the signed/decoded file back.  Someone
opens the machine, tamper switch turns the box off.  Box off?  Key is now
left in encrypted state, most likely hidden in one of the many sound

The problem I ran into firsthand with archive sites is that they tend to
turn into porn or pirated software servers.  One could then have the
software delete after a download.  Anyway, one is always open to a denial
of service attack where someone just throws chunks of /dev/random at you.
(About last April when I wrote an offsite secure storage program, I was
testing it on another site.  Some 2 bit children found out about it and
decided to turn it into a porn server, causing major bandwidth to be taken
up.  I then set it to delete any files grabbed when one specifies the MD5
hash.  This stopped the onrush of outgoing stuff, however I got a
bunch of people dumping large amounts of random junk just to deny others
service out of spite.  To foil this, I set a per megabyte limit.  Then,
they just anon-remailed bunches of little files.  I got tired of the abuse
and pulled the plug on it.  It didn't even reach beta testing.)
