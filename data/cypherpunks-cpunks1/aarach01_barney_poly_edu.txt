Hey guys,
It's me.  Don't let the new account name, and the horrible name of this despicable machine throw you off.  It's me, Ray Arachelian.  Some rat(s?) hacked into photon, the machine where my home account lives, and now, while I can read my prism email by going through major acrobatic maneouvers, I have to use this slimy shitty student account.
So for the time being, please direct any mail to this account aarach01 at barney.poly.edu (God I hate this machine's name!)  I'll still be able to read anything you send to prism for the time being (durring winter recess they said.)
See, I have to log in to barney, ftp my mailbox over from prism, telnet to barney and delete my mailbox, and then read it with pine... :-(
[Eileen, could you at least build a home directory for my old account with a .forward to Barney for now?  Or just let me use prism without having to have photon connected to it?]

@_subject: Comdex Disks? 
That was my puppy.  My friend Sal at panix and I gave the disks away at PC-EXPO and at various other events.   I have the lastest disk version of it if you want it, but you'll need to update PGP on the disk and maybe include/add/remove some articles from the articles package.
You can call me at 212-618-8818 (work) or email me here, but with the situation with my account, call me instead.  (And that goes for anyone else on the list willing to send diskettes out.  Please don't call me if you aren't going to give out disks and are just interested in a copy.  You can ftp the old copies from somewhere in Canada...)
