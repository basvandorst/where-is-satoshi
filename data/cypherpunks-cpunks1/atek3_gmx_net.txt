@_subject: Privacybuy.com sucks 
Ha, read this lil blurb from their site:
PrivateBuy is the only personal payment account that lets you safely and anonymously shop anywhere online. PrivateBuy cloaks your identity, shields your money and offers the same universal acceptance as a credit card. It's the vehicle that ensures your peace-of-mind, security and privacy when shopping online. As a PrivateBuyer you have incredible buying power, protection and anonymity. Your purchases are kept private and off your credit card statement. You'll also stay off marketing and mailing lists. Whether you're concerned about using your credit card all over the Web, worried about identity theft, or just looking for a better way to buy -- PrivateBuy gives you the confidence you need to purchase whatever you want. Ya thats a load of shit!  If you ask me they are either working for the government or making a fortune by turning in the idiots who use it under the guise of anonymity.
The worst link in the system is payment.  to use privacybuy you need to fund your account with a credit card I don't get it. What is the point of paying them a 4 dollar service charge if a 2 dollar subpoena will give away your name address and vital statistics!  I'd hate to see the look on the basterds face who orders chemicals from fisher thinking he got away clean, when 20 jack booted thugs come in and kick his door down!
Can one of the more educated cypherpunks inform me of the appropriate way to buy and pay for things anonymously online?

Solution?  Fentanyl analogues.  Synthesis is not too tricky, precursors are obtainable to the determined.  3-Methyl Fentanyl is a opoid similar to Heroin only about 300 times more potent placing its activity in the 20 microgram range, one kilo, well distributed, is enough to intoxicate 50 million people!  Its so active it could be placed on blotter paper.  The cops could never stop the tide of 3 independant chemists each channeling thousands of grams of fentanyl all over the country.  The end would be a matter of time.

  I HAVE 2 LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN MOLESTED BY THEIR STEP GRANDFATHER. THEY HAVE  TALKED TO BY THE SHERIFFS DEPT. AND THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO ORAL SEX, BUT NOT ACTUALLY PENETRATED. THE DEPUTY SAID  THE CASE WORKER WAS WALKING ON THIN ICE, AND IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT HOLD UP IN COURT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD. WHEN I CALLED TO SEE IF THIS MAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED, THEY TOLD ME IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I AM WILLING TO GO TO JAIL BEFORE LETTING THESE GIRLS GO BACK TO THIS SITUATION. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY THIS. I CANT BEAR FOR THEM TO HAVE TO EVER HAVE TO SEE THIS PERSON AGAIN, BUT MY SON, THEIR FATHER DOES NOT HAVE CUSTODY. AT THE MOMENT HE HAS THEM, BUT THEIR MOTHER WILL NOT COMPLY WITH DFS SO THEY CAN GET COUNSELING. THE DFS HAS SENT THE MEDICAID CARDS SO THEY CAN GET THE COUNSELING, BUT SHE HAS TO SIGN THE CONSENT, AND SHE WONT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE DOCTORS FOR AN EXAM, BECAUSE SHE ALSO WONT SIGN FOR THAT. THE LAWS OF THIS LAND ARE COMPLICATED, AND IM SURE THAT SOMEWHERE THE REASON FOR THIS CONSENT FROM THE MOTHER, IS APPROPRIATE, BUT AT THIS TIME, I AM FRUSTRATED THAT THEIR MOTHER AND HER NEW HUSBANDS FAMILY ARE ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE LAW . WE NEED TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ANYONE THAT IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR BEST INTEREST. THESE ARE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND DESERVE TO HAVE A FUTURE, UNMOLESTED.  CATHERINE M. HALL GRANDMOTHER   BOSSLION

Oh, well if andy yauch knows that the only way to stop violence is to "ban
guns", well shit, what are we waiting for!
Because when guns are banned, only the government (and criminals) will have
guns, sounds like the kind of country I want to live in...no wait, thats the
kind of country stalin wants to live in, oops my bad.

@_subject: Shooting down 'Bandit Satellites' 
the nazi's were using silver instead of platinum in their WWII experimental
jets, and some jet packs use H2O2 and silver as their power source.  and
given the difference in price, silver is a bargain.
but i think your main problem would be H2O2.  The stuff used in rockets is
100%, in english we call it an explosive oxidizer.  A spill of 35% H2O2 will
bleach your skin faster than you can say fuck, 100% is just nuts.
Producing it is a bitch too.  This isn't ur average fermentation of ethanol.
to make h2o2 you have to aquire a few questionable chemicals, such as
2-pentyl-anthraquinone.  Not to mention you need pure hydrogen and oxygen.
Also there dangers in raising the concentration from working 40% to
dangerous but useful 100%.
more on this later
