@_subject: (fwd) [prodigy] Am-prodigy correction 
This came over our Reuters wire - it looks like the Prodigy message
in question was not a private message, but rather a message
on a public forum (where Prodigy is known to monitor such things.)
I wonder whether this correction is going to get press in the print
media, most of which are not likely to be hip enough to be able to
convey the difference to their readers (who are not necessarily likely to know or care).

FYI.  --Ed
If this PGP case ever goes to trial it might just end once and for all
the idiocy of the US gov't trying to prevent the rest of the world from
reading what's already been published.  Butthead: uh huh...uh huh...say Beevis, do you think they have computers
          in Europe?
Beevis: huh huh...huh huh...Nope, they don't have phones either...huh huh
Butthead: So, uh huh...this PGP thing is gonna stay in America?
Beevis: uh huh...yeah, that's right...uh huh...right here...huh huh
Butthead: Encryption is cool.
Beevis: Yeah.
