Yes, but there will still need to be a way for new people to join the  lists, (and the net in general) before they've had a chance to "prove  themselves."  Allowing all new id's to post to the whole group on a  probationary basis is unacceptable;  as soon as someone proves  obnoxious enough to kick off they could just start over with a new  id.  The obvious answer is that a moderator will be necessary for all  closed lists that require a positive rep for posting and that don't  wish to be forever limited to their founding members.  After a few  lucid posts passed by the moderator, an individual would gain enough  of a reputation not to be filtered out any longer.
Of course, anyone who's heard Howard Stern fans invade political  call-in shows will realize there's not much that can be done with  those weird people who will spend a lot of time and energy to appear  credible, only to annoy people.

First, rms isn't the LPF.  He's practically the FSF, and supports the  LPF, but the two organizations aren't synonymous.  Second, I believe the LPF has made an official statement that they  will _not_ work with SPI.  SPI is primarily funded by large holders  of software patents, and LPF believes that this database will give  patent holders an advantage in defending their patents in court (i.e.  against suits by LPF to invalidate the patents).  I'm not even a  member of the LPF; you should write to them for their actual  Third, I'm not sure this is appropriate to the list, unless someone  expects to find "folklore" about public key cryptography that  predates RSA, etc.

@_subject: Secure voice software issues 
[Re: squeezing 13.3 kbps data w/o start&stop bits over modem] Well...  How much latency does LAPM really add?  Little enough that  full duplex keystrokes echo back nearly instantly on my connections.   People talk over satellite links with more delay than that all the  time.  Since we're not going to get toll quality voice out of the  vocoders anyway, and the error correcting stuff is especially useful  for encrypted data streams...  I think V.42 is probably a good idea  for a cryptophone project. I'm in favor of getting a minimal version that will run on the lowest  common denominator hardware first.   (Might have something to do with  the fact that I just spent a couple hundred dollars on an internal  V.32bis modem that doesn't do synchronous :^)

To which Julf replied:
I'm worried that the "serious bug" might be that the system won't  prevent the gullible from mailing "deadbeat" their e-mail addresses  through penet.  Once they've done that, he can "piece together" their  anonymous IDs and email addresses quite easily.
I hope I'm wrong about this, though...

So,  theoretically, if a group in each COCOM-complying country and a group  out of the reach of COCOM each independently implemented software to  do the public-key cryptography (the U.S. group is the only one that  will have to worry about licensing PKP's patents), then trading  encrypted mail would be unquestionably legal.
It would also be a lot of wasted work and duplicated effort, and I  don't see any reason to respect the laws that make exporting or  importing this software illegal.  RIPEM has no doubt escaped the U.S.  since RSADSI put it up for anonymous FTP last week, and PGP is

I may be able to help out in a DOS project (though I seem to be migrating  quickly to Linux as it stabilizes...)  Perhaps the GPL'ed program term  would be useful in serial multiplexing applications.  It's quite nice for  Unix boxes, letting all kinds of streams coexist (even redirecting TCP/IP  ports over serial without the overhead of SLIP/PPP).  I believe I've  heard someone on comp.os.linux or gnu.misc.discuss talk about hacking DES  into term, so it sounds doable.  I'm not sure how much the code assumes  Unix serial device handing, but I'll have a look at the code.

@_subject: REMAIL: X-TTL and X-Discard 
Rolling your own encryption wrapper for the remailer chain you're sending  through is a Good Thing, but your modification would be useful if you think of  the cypherpunk remailer network as a "back end" for an anonymous/pseudonymous  server like Julf's.
Ideally, a pseudonym server will only keep an encrypted remailer chain for a  user's return address (along with the unencrypted adress of the first remailer  on the chain).  The nymserver _doesn't_know_ what remailers are in the chain,  so it can't encrypt the message with each of their public keys.  But if the  server can include a header line inside the encryption envelope that tells the  remailer to encrypt with the next remailer's key, we can be sure that an  adversary is still unable to match up incoming and outgoing messages.
Setting up a pseudonym server with this kind of encrypted return address is  good, of course, if you're worried about its database being seized.  Without  the cooperation of each remailer in the chain, the database doesn't give an  adversary anything useful.
And since now we've got TTL as another use for a next-step-encryption feature  in the remailers...  I'd better go get those remailer scripts and a UUCP feed  for my new Linux box.

@_subject: REMAIL: problems 
. . .
This is a serious misfeature.  An essential goal of remailer design is that  they be stateless.  A message is forwarded, then immediately forgotten.  Any  historical information about messages that have gone through is a potential  weakness.  Message serial numbers are a perfect audit trail.
Consider cryptographic secret-sharing protocols.  If we have 20 remailers,  each remailer could split his key into 20 pieces, 15 of which would be  necessary to reconstruct the key.  When a remailer goes down, the key could  be reconstructed and given to a substitute remailer.  The system can survive  the loss of 5 remailers, and would require a collaboration of 15, or 3/4 of  the remailer operators to intentionally break the security.

Digital Express doesn't require that the GECOS field of /etc/passwd contain  real names, although they obviously allow it.  (Finger  jthomas at access.digex.net for my full name, as well as my PGP key :^)
I seem to remember that the new user signup script they use explicitly gives  you the option of signing up under a pseudonymn, although they'll check up on  you by phone if you do (and presumably write your name in the Big Book at that  point).  I've seen quite a few public access Unix sites advertising  "anonymous" accounts lately, especially after Julf's server went down.
