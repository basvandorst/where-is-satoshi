@_subject: hello, 
we are the organization letting people know the facts which major media sometimes somehow choses to ignore
if you do not wish to know the truth or if you believe America is perfect, simply send an e-mail to remove at unitedamericaparty.com  and you will be removed
the price we pay
1. highway detours which lead you to go the wrong way - signs mixed up in order to get you to go to the wrong town / city, to pay extra toll / spend money
cause: Officials elected not by the people
2. commercials on TV reminding to eat and eat causing to become overweight
cause: TV networks being owned not by the people, but by the scum who do not care about the people
3. disrespect / distrust among humanity
cause: Constant lies on major networks commercials
all these problems and many more can be fixed by simply being a little more openminded
thank you, rytis in philadelphia
