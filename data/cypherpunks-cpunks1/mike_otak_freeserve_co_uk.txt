Actually it isn't clear if this is what he implies, because you have left out
the middle of the quotation. You also haven't said where you're quoting
from - a title and page number would let the rest of us check that you
haven't just stuck two unrelated passages together to prop up your argument.

Just to get off the point, Serbia isn't *actually* a dictatorship.
It may be a pretty feeble example of a democracy, but they do hold real
elections, and it is (constitutionally at least) possible to kick the ruling party out of power.
Whether it or not it now *turns into* a dictatorship following Milosevic losing the elections is another matter entirely.

A quick compare and contrast:

The first one means "reports of a significant number of massacres were discovered to be false". The second and third ones means "it was repeatedly discovered that all of the reports of massacres were false".
"fabricates or falsifies quotes" eh?
