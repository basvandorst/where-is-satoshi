I was looking at my RAM when I noticed several passwords I have frequently used were still there, and as I never turn off my comp, I was wondering if there is a way you can "clean" your RAM?
I also got errors when installing LILO on my DOS partition, so now I *CAN'T* boot without a bootdisk, and I think LILO sticks itself on the master boot record, is there an MBR editor?
Where can I get a list of Candian Remailers?
Is there a DOS and/or Winbloze 3.* Email program that I can "forge" headers? (ex: Like in Linux fastmail adding: -f billc at whitehouse.gov)

No shit, Batman -- especially seeing as TCM already discussed it on
this list over a week ago...

Is nym.alias.net down? I've sent a request twice using
a different remailer chain each time yet it still doesn't
reply. It's been about two days since I sent it in.
I did however create a nym with dongco.hyperreal.art.pl.
Is this service reliable? or will it disppear quickly?

I see.  Would you mind elaborating?  We are going to burn in hell
because...? We don't use AOL? We like our privacy? We use cryptosystems
that you'll never understand in your life time?  Because we know how
to use (and create) remailers?
