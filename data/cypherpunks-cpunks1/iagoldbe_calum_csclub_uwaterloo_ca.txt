Is there a standard way we're supposed to get together to divvy up the
keyspace?  Not knowing of any, I'll just announce that I'm working
on those keys that start with "a", from 0xafffffffff down to 0xa000000000.
I seem to be getting about 200000 to 400000 keys/sec, so it should take
about another 2 days (assuming the machines stay up that long...).
If anyone wants to join in, feel free.  Get original source from
 (Damien's code),
and patch it with the diff at the bottom.  Note: I don't think there's
any crypto in the diff, and the rest of the sources are in France, so this
should be OK with the spooks. But you never know...
Compile the patched source on anything you can get, and run
./slave -t -d csclub.uwaterloo.ca 9114
The IP is 129.97.134.11 if you need it.  You can add -v or -V for more
verbosity, and -n num if you have num processors.

Sorry I missed the fast/soon distinction.  I've stopped the search after
searching keys starting with 0xaf down to 0xa5, and will join the group
search after I get settled in after moving to Berkeley tomorrow.  I
encourage the people who pointed their clients at me (thanks!) to stop
them, and to join the group.
In the interests of not adding a few days to the time, we should ignore
the fact that a bit of the keyspace has already been searched, and
start again.

See below.
Yup.  I just had a program sitting on the ecash port that hexdumped
anything fed to it.  That, and a copy of the binary to read...
 From what I gathered from Doug's posts a little while back, the _client_
stuff is perfectly fine; only the _bank_ stuff is Chaum-patented.
Here are the messy byte-details:
The data encoding:
Header:  2 bytes
0xa0 0x80+type
where type is:
0x12: Payment Request
0x0a: Payment
0x29: Length of Message
0x13: Dummy Message
(there are others)
EOR: 1 byte
End of Record indicator
n-byte Integer:
0x90 0x80+n followed by n bytes of data, MSB first
n should probably be 1 <= n <= 4.
0x91 0x84 followed by 4 bytes of time since 1970
0x92 0x80+(length) followed by (length) bytes
0x94 0x80+(length) followed by (length) bytes
There are other types, like 0x93 (Multi-precision integer) that I
haven't decoded yet.
The first message from the shop:

Yes.  D'oh.  I realized this while talking to Dave shortly after I posted.
All the bank does is send back the cube root of what it received from the
client.  If the client wants to multiply by the cube of a random number
before sending to the bank, and dividing by that random number after,
that's up to it.  The system Hal mentioned, though (client sends payment
requests, receives payments, deposits them), still doesn't infringe,
as long as it doesn't do _withdrawls_.

I now know what the empty string and the 0 are for.  In the event that
a Payment Request is sent out-of-band (in an application/ecash message,
for example), the string and integer are the hostname and port (commonly
1100) to which the payer should connect in order to send a payment.

@_subject: ecash lottery (Was: ecash casino) 
In article <199511291640.IAA28114 at infinity.c2.org>,
Does anyone know what jurisdictions allow lotteries/gambling?
Here's an off-the-cuff idea:
[Disclaimer: The following post is a gedanken experiment.  It should not
Anonymous email lotteries:
Advertise the lottery (and include a public PGP key) through some remailer
in one of the above jurisdictions.  Use a remailer that allows pseudonymous
replies.  In the announcement, include a secure hash of the next drawing's
winning number (appended to appropriate amounts of random noise).  Advertise
to a mailing list or a newsgroup, like alt.anonymous.lotteries.announce.
People pay by sending:
A payment made out to " (the ecash wildcard)
Their choice of lottery ticket number
A PGP Public key
encrypted with the lottery's public key, to the remailer address.
A lottery consists simply of displaying the winning number and random
noise, whose hash was previously posted (so the participants know
you're not cheating).
Now: there's likely no Web-of-Trust to the various PGP keys involved,
so the lottery's Reputation will have to be built up.  A good way to
do this is to have smaller prizes being won fairly often (e.g. by matching
the last digit/few bits), so that it's obvious the lottery is not just
collecting money without awarding prizes.
The lottery pays out by replying to the winner's pseudonymous messages
with their payment (made out to " encrypted with their PGP key.
There can be other variants on the lottery.  For example, the participant
whose ticket is _closest_ to the winning number wins all the money
in the pot (minus a cut for the house).  A problem with this, and various
other forms of the lottery, is that it's hard for the lottery to prove
that it's not cheating (either in the amount of money it took in, or
that the losers of the lottery actually lost, etc.).
In this model of payment, no participant knows anything about any other
participant except a remailer's Reply-Block, and a PGP public key.
However, using the features of ecash (from what I know of how it works,
which isn't all that much (yet)), a payer can, in collaboration with the
bank, identify the payee.  This may be undesirable for the lottery operator
and/or the participants.
If (when) details of ecash are published (by Digicash or by someone else),
it would likely be easier to work out how to achieve all-way anonymity with
ecash.  I seem to recall some mention of how this would be done here
a while ago, and Lucky said he was going (before he started working for
them) "to write some scripts that will lay the groundwork for some of the
more unusual applications of Ecash".
Follow-up thought:
The lottery operator, instead of depositing the coins he receives
from the participants, stockpiles them, and forwards them on to the
winner(s).  If a participant complains to the bank, and the bank traces
his payment, it is likely to merely identify another participant
(who is not doing anything illegal, AFAIK (IANAL; it's illegal to _run_
this sort of thing inside the US, not to _play_ it, right?)), and the
lottery owner can even claim he is merely a participant, in the chance event
that he _is_ the one identified, and he happens to be in the US...
As far as I can tell, then, with this sort of method, the only way the
lottery operator could be caught (technically; he could be caught in
non-technical ways, say by being overheard bragging about it (Don't laugh;
it's been done.)) is by having the remailer (or remailer chain) compromised.
So; is there a problem with the implementation outlined above?  If it were
implemented, would people play it?

But with complete anonymity, no player knows who else is playing, let
alone who won.  So if you were going to pay off yourself, you may as well
just pay off no one.
The idea behind my proposal was that any participant can determine if he has
won.  The winning number (a hash of which was published beforehand, as in
a "bit commitment" scheme) is announced.  Anyone who picked a number
that, say, matched in the last digit, wins $2.  If you matched the
last two digits, you win $10, etc.  The house (without sacrificing
reputation) can't arrange who the big payoffs will go to, nor can it
(as I think Tim suggested) give out lots of small prizes and no big ones.

Yes.  I have a pair of standard 1.44 MB floppies, one of which has
a Linux kernel (boot disk), the other has a filesystem containing
just enough stuff to be able to stick the disk in an arbitrary

I'm going to use the new ramdisk features in the 1.3 kernels to
put more useful stuff on the disk, too, like file utils, maybe... :-)
But if I can squeeze everything I need to turn an arbitrary PC
into a secure (modulo hardware) login session into 1.44 MB + boot image,
I don't think there's a problem putting all the stuff you want on a
135MB disk.  Hell, the _hard disk_ on my Linux box is only 80MB...

Here's section 120.17 of ITAR:
@ 120.17 -- Export.
   Export means:
   (1) Sending or taking a defense article out of the United States in any
manner, except by mere travel outside of the United States by a person whose
personal knowledge includes technical data; or
   (2) Transferring registration, control or ownership to a foreign person of
any aircraft, vessel, or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List, whether
in the United States or abroad; or
   (3) Disclosing (including oral or visual disclosure) or transferring in the
United States any defense article to an embassy, any agency or subdivision of a
foreign government (e.g., diplomatic missions); or
   (4) Disclosing (including oral or visual disclosure) or transferring
technical data to a foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad; or
   (5) Performing a defense service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a
foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad.
   (6) A launch vehicle or payload shall not, by reason of the launching of such
vehicle, be considered an export for purposes of this subchapter. However, for
certain limited purposes (see @ 126.1 of this subchapter), the controls of this
subchapter may apply to any sale, transfer or proposal to sell or transfer
defense articles or defense services.
Item (1) allows people to travel abroad if they know crypto.  It's unclear
that it allows them to emigrate or return to their country of origin.
Items (3),(4),(5) seem to prevent such a person from using, or even mentioning,
crypto to or "on behalf of" a foreign person.
(6) is cute.  Launching a missle at Iraq isn't considered export...

manufacture, production, assembly, testing, repair, maintenance, modification,
operation, demilitarization, destruction, processing or use of defense articles;
