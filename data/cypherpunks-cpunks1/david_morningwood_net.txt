I have a Glock M17 and M21.  They are both extremely accurate and reliable.  Glocks are serious gun fighter's weapons because they have no extra bells and whistles like external safeties and hammer decockers. They also don't have different trigger pulls between the first shot and the following shots.  When I attended Front Sight half the instructors carried Glock M21s and the other half carried M1911 clones.
Because they have no thumb safety, Glocks need to be carried in holster that covers the tigger (of course that is best for all other makes also).  I comfortably carry  my M21 all day long in an inside the pants holster on my strong side hip.  With this carry I have never been asked to display my CHL.  When George W. was governor I interviewed him at an event in a park, and none of the 30 or 40 cops or 10 or 12 body guards spotted it.
I suggest that you consider a .40 instead of a 9mm.  You should always carry the largest gun in the in the biggest caliber you can control and conceal.  The bigger the gun the easier and faster it is to shoot accurately.  The bigger the caliber the more stopping power.  The reason the US military switched to .45 caliber handguns is becuause .38 caliber handguns were so ineffective against the Moros in the Phillipines.  Since 9mm is .36 caliber, the military has basicially returned to a caliber proven to be not up to the task.  Glock offers .40 in each of the frame sizes it offers 9mm in.
That being said, a .22 in your pocket beats a .45 you left at home any day.  I carry a North American Arms five shot mini revolver in my front pocket.  These little guns are not much bigger than a pocket knife.  They are inexpensive yet they are extremely well made and come with a life time warranty.   They are fun to shoot and I have fired several thousand rounds through mine.  It takes a lot of practice to hit a soda can six feet away but it would be a whole lot better than nothing at point blank range.

Last I heard the Isreali military still did.  An empty chamber was US military standard carry until the switch from 1911 the Beretta.  The military was the last to hear about the Modern Technique of the Pistol.

After you acquire a handgun you have to figure out what to do with it.  Are you going to carry it on your person, or leave it in your vehicle or at home?  Obviously it is most readily accessible if you carry it in a holster.  This is also the most secure place for your weapon.  You know absolutely where it is and who has it.  If you decide on holster carry buy the best quality you can find.  It makes no sense to spend several hundred dollars on a handgun and then stuff it into a $15 one size fits all leather sleave.  A well designed holster will hold the weapon securely without the use of thumb snaps, etc.; will allow you to assume the correct firing grip while your gun is in the holster; will not allow access to the trigger while the weapon is holstered; and it will retain its shape so that you can reholster with one hand.
Handguns can also be carried conviently in a fannypack or a purse.  If you carry in a purse, personal planner, etc., you must train yourself to always retain control of it.  It takes a lot of practice to learn to never set it down and move away from it without securing it somehow.
The next step is to learn how to get your handgun into action as rapidly as possible without shooting yourself in the ass or the foot (which wastes ammo and and impairs your ability to survive a shootout).  Ideally you should attend course where you can learn the correct skills and tactics from the start.  I took personal handgun courses from the American Small Arms Academy and Front Sight.  Other well known schools are Gunsight, Thunder Ranch, and Lethal Force Institute.
Two good books to purchase are "The Modern Technique of the Pistol" by Gregory Boyce Morrison and "Combat Handgunnery" by Chuck Taylor.  Both books cover all the basic gun handling skills, defensive tactics, and principles of firearms safety.  T
hey also break down the presentation from the holster (quick draw) into individual steps which can be repeated until they are programmed into your muscle memory.  When an action is repeated 3,000 times it becomes a programmed response which is performed automatically.  Because of that I couldn't possibly fire too soon during a high speed presentation.  To shoot myself during my draw I would literally have to slow down and do it Keep your powder dry,

In Texas deadly force is legally justified to prevent the immenent commission of burglary.  This means you can shoot if someone is getting ready to break in.  You don't have to wait until they are inside.  The Texas penal code requires that you retreat instead of using deadly force if you have the option unless you are using deadly force against someone who is unlawfully entering your habitation.  In that case you don't have to retreat even if you can.  Some states require you to retreat even if you are in your home if you It is a myth that if someone is crawling through your window and he falls outside after you shoot him that you need to pull the body inside.  You are foolish if you think that a forensic team can't tell how the shooting took place and that the body was moved.  Any jurisdiction that will prosecute and convict someone because the body of a person attempting burglary happens to be on the outside instead of the inside will certainly prosecute and get a conviction for tampering with the evidence.  Tampering with the evidence will also be considered evidence of guilt of murder rather than self defense.

If you will reread your own link to the Penal code you see that only theft and criminal mischief have the nighttime stipulation.
Sec. 9.42. DEADLY FORCE TO PROTECT PROPERTY. A person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect land or tangible, movable property: ~ ~ (1) if he would be justified in using force against the other under Section 9.41; and ~ ~ (2) when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary: ~ ~ ~ (A) to prevent the other's imminent commission of arson, burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, theft during the nighttime, or criminal mischief during the nighttime; or ~ ~ ~ (B) to prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property; and ~ ~ (3) he reasonably believes that: ~ ~ ~ (A) the land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other means; or ~ ~ ~ (B) the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. The following statute is the one that says you have to retreat unless you are at home.  I am a Texas Department of Public Safety certified Concealed Handgun License instructor.  Commander Rodriquez, the DPS use of force instructor explained that "immenent commision" means someone is getting ready to do something.  The statutes say that you have to have a reasonable belief that someone is about to commit one of the above crimes and that deadly force is necessary to prevent it.  You don't even have to be right.  You just have to be able to explain to a jury why you belief was reaonable.  Sec. 9.32. DEADLY FORCE IN DEFENSE OF PERSON. (a) A person is justified in using deadly force against another: ~ ~ (1) if he would be justified in using force against the other under Section 9.31; ~ ~ (2) if a reasonable person in the actor's situation would not have retreated; and ~ ~ (3) when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary: ~ ~ ~ (A) to protect himself against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful deadly force; or ~ ~ ~ (B) to prevent the other's imminent commission of aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery. ~ (b) [added 9/1/95] The requirement imposed by Subsection (a)(2) does not apply to an actor who uses force against a person who is at the time of the use of force committing an offense of unlawful entry in the habitation of the The following statute says that you can install devices if they don't cause death or serious bodily injury.  Punji sticks are verboten.  Rigged pepper spray dispensing devices are not.
Sec. 9.44. USE OF DEVICE TO PROTECT PROPERTY. The justification afforded by Sections 9.41 and 9.43 applies to the use of a device to protect land or tangible, movable property if: ~ ~ (1) the device is not designed to cause, or known by the actor to create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily injury; and ~ ~ (2) use of the device is reasonable under all the circumstances as the actor reasonably believes them to be when he installs the device.

I don't need or want to talk to your attorney.  But you should at least read and try to understand the statutes that you link to and make reference to.  The big fucking deal is I have attended four of DPS's intructor classes where their attorneys and instructors explain the use of force laws to us in the manner they want them passed on to the public.  I do not pass on uninformed opinions on topics I am not qualified to comment on.

I certainly never said anything like that.  If you are going to put words in my mouth then you don't need me to carry on.  Knock yourself out.

Public property was paid for by looting private individuals' pockets or appropriating it directly.  The concept of regulating public activities is pure socialist bullshit.  Ordinances prohibiting or regulating any activity on private property is part of our creeping nanny state totalitarianism.  Any individual who enforces, or any politician who votes for a law that uses force to regulate behavior is guilty of initiating force against anyone affected by the law, and is a deserving target of retaliation. Any individual who votes for one of these political scumbags or urges them to enact such a law is also a deserving target of retaliation.

The concept of, and respect for private property are essential elements of individual liberty.  They cannot be separated.  There is an inverse proportion between the power the governments have over private property and freedom.
It is the initiation of force that is wrong.  People who try to rob others should have their behavior regulated by being killed by their intended victims.  Hiring professionals to deal with robbers is a valid response to the robbers' initiation of force.  Killing people who use force to regulate individuals who smoke in public is also a legitimate response to the their initiation of force.
