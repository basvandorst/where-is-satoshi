I'm not sure, yet, if I want to agree with this guy to any amount, but
this idea, recast into a safe form that doesn't get out of control,
might be a good idea.  I thought of it as a way to get K-12
students/schools connected 'safely'.
See below:
I had a similar idea, but knowing how hard it is to get everyone using
new software and data streams, I wanted to piggyback onto News.  My
original reason for thinking about it was for Internet systems that
would like to give access to News, etc. to K-12 students and schools.
A big problem is material that parents and teachers would object to.
I have absolutely no desire to censor anything or prevent adults from
running into or getting anything (quite the opposite, actually), but
there is no getting around the desired restrictions on info flow to
Basically, I suggested that special messages be standardized that
would endorse messages for certain distributions.  Old (existing...)
news software would just pass the messages like others, but news
systems that wanted to rate or hide improper messages could pay
attention to them.  My software would probably take the form of
patches to INN and tin, etc.  There would be positive and negative
endorsements, of course with the possibility of signature keys, etc.
You could configure certain users or the system to be sensitive to any
combination of endorsements:  The idea is that the administrator or
user could determine who they would pay attention to.  Other things
like voting, number of endorsements, etc. could easily be done.
One senario is that teachers or organizations worldwide could
'register' to each other and share the responsibility of endorsing
messages in certain groups.  If there needed to be culpability, the
endorsers could be tracked down if needed.
This would be totally optional on an adult's account and mandatory on
a minor's account, unless proper permission was obtained.  It might,
in certain situations, also reduce the signal-to-noise ratio.  Another
interesting use is to change the nature of moderated groups: the group
could be unmoderated in the current sense, but users could choose
moderators who would agree to endorse messages that had good content.
You could have several 'competing' moderators in the same group,
almost like news organizations.
'alt.best.of.internet' is a limited capability version of this idea.
My method, IMHO, is a positive version of the negative method espoused
here.  I do not like a central 'ratings server' of any kind.  There
should be multiple competing 'opinions' and you can ascribe to any
existing one or in combination or be independant.
So how does our current society hold together?  Where is that central
'ratings server'?  (Nielsons dosn't count :-))
We should stay decentralized, especially, on the net.  When some of us
think of an anarchic system, we are making the assumption that some
good stability and structure will be created organically.  Probably it
will be better than that designed with preconceived opinions.
And, I feel compelled to add, you are the only mouth-frothing person
I've run across recently.

@_subject: anonymous video rental store 
One easy way around this is to have completely anonymous customers:
The store doesn't record any id at all.  The simplest way to do this
is to have customers make a cash deposit large enough to cover
replacement costs of the videos.  You would have to limit the number
of videos, especially/only for those without a track record.
You could even leave an anon email id to allow them to remind you to
return an overdue video, etc.
The only risk here is that someone besides the account owner might
'close' the account and take the deposit.  A good 'id' card/number
should solve that.
Actually, around here, that isn't too far from what you end up with
after being a customer for a year: I've moved, changed phone numbers
and have a new VISA, since the old one expired.  I'm sure they still
have my dr. lic. num and maybe even my ssn though.
Not even knowing that you're a customer seems better than trying not
to track which videos you have.
How about an anon deposit service that multiple companies (utilities,
etc.) could put claims on, similar to VISA holds.

Normally, by a near-field receiver.  I don't know of any other way.
An AM band unit is about $110 and an FM band unit is $200-400.
I've seen ads for the AM band and I saw the FM unit at Hamvention in Dayton.
The AM band unit can detect FM transmissions, you just can't hear the
traffic, it's just quiet.  It was also advertised to be able to detect
leaking microwaves, etc.
If I understand it, nearfield receivers and frequency counters rely on
the relative strength surrounding a transmitter at close range to sync
with the frequency.  No tuning at all.

I don't believe you can be forced to say anything if you believe it
will incriminate you.  Only if you are given immunity can you be
compelled, and only then under threat of contempt of court, which is a
misdemeanor.  The police/courts have all kinds of ways to encourage
you, but the Fifth still holds.
They 'have' the evidence, so you are not withholding.  The key is your
knowledge, which is protected as much as if they were trying to force
you to tell them where the body was in a murder investigation.  It's
up to them to find it.
If they were dumb enough to rely on what data was present instead of
observed traffic, they're in bad shape, IMHO.

What you say is reasonably correct, but you obviously don't agree with
or understand the hostility.  Free Thinkers, which include atheists
(weak, strong, ...), agnostics, church/state separatists, etc., are
sometimes hostile to religion because religion is hostile to them.
It constantly puts down those who don't believe and represents a
'dumbing' force in society, IMHO.
I try to be tolerant of religion, people's beliefs, etc., except when
they cause censorship or other perceived oppression to those I care
And this from a thread on tolerance on the list!!!
The name 'Freethinker', BTW, comes from the fact that religion and

you should be doing, etc.  A consious sentient being should be

in some way or who want to counteract the spreading tendancies of
religion.  The members tend to like the label 'Freethinker' for
themselves and have pins as such.  The group is made up of atheists
(strong & weak), agnostics, 'non-practicing Jews', PFLAG members (a
group that falls under the religiously persecuited label), and
church/state separatists (many of which may be somewhat religious).
If you want to find a comprehensive news reporting of priest
transgressions, for instance, their newsletter gathers info from all

That started me down an interesting line of thought...
You can get spread spectrum radio/data modems that do 256Kbits/sec

because it is limited to .8watts (I think).  I believe 10 miles is the
limit with an omnidirectional antenna.  Spread spectrum should be
pretty hard to triangulate on.  Remember that the technology came from
unjammable military radios.
I think you'd have to have a fairly sophisticated scanner to even pick
it up.
Using a creative arrangement, this could provide a good cover for
physical location.  (If you could get the server in the back of a city
bus or something...)

That's not what he said.  He said 'modem', and as a consumer item that's
far from a 'Rockwell integrated modem module'...  That part is a small
part of the whole price of the modem, which you'd know if you looked
at price sheets.  For a 99 modem (which I see all the time with 14400
fax/data), the modem chip is probably $15-20.  The accepted minimum
markup on a manufactured item is 50% of selling price.
Of course, you can cut the margin if you sell enough of them, and it's
hard to say what the manuf. margin on a $99 modem is.
In anycase, he's talking about a slower modem, effectively, using a
DSP (Zyxels, which beat most modems on features and performance have
always used DSP's: they do data, fax, voice, callerid, touch tone
recognition, etc.  They include a 68K and >512K ram (I think)).

You've given me an idea.  I felt the edges of it when discussing my

Instead of controlling every message that gets posted, why don't we
instead allow email endorsements.  Each message has a unique message
id, is fairly easy to identify, and could of course be PGP signed.
What if we hacked a .procmailrc to 'mark' (Subject change?) or filter
messages that weren't marked properly (say they were signed but not by
the key you had for that person) OR those that received a later
endorsement (positive/neg/typing) from someone on your trusted list.
(ED: sorry for the long lines, I sometimes feel the thought is more
clear that way.)
Acting on an endorsement after you had received a message means
modifying a mailbox, which needs to be done carefully.  You might want

I haven't been able to keep up with all of the Stego discussion, but on
pictures with few colors and a large amount of a small number of
colors (like cartoons, etc. with a backround), you could use the
unused color table entries.  You set these to be the same colors as
the correspondingly largest used colors and use them when juxtaposed
with their color.
Original:   [0,A]
Stego-colormap:  (1/0 repeat) [0=1,A=B]
Won't compress as well of course, but the picture is identical.
Multiple color entries at the same setting could be used to encode
more bits.  (0=1=2=3 gives 2 bits info).
You then leave the least used colors alone.
More easily detectable I suppose though since multiple color settings
were the same.  One way around that is to make them just a shade off,
which wouldn't change the actual color much.
