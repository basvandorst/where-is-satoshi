@_subject: [tor-talk] End-to-end correlation for fun and profit 
I ran this script on the current consensus. The full results (the
nodes-sniff-summary file) are below my signature. How did you compile
the country-codes to IPs list? That wasn't produced by the script.
It's comforting that this approach yields quickly diminishing returns.
Going from 25 to 60 networks only gets you a 10% increase in networks
surveillance (if I'm reading the output correctly), and returns plateau
entirely at that point (I'm considering about two percent to be in the
noise, which may not be appropriate to this domain).
Also, it's not immediately clear whether eavesdropping those networks
would actually get you strong enough correlation to accurately
de-anonymize users[1]. If our rodent(?) friend(s?) could comment on
this, I'd appreciate their expertise.
I also think that if it were possible for "unsophisticated law
enforcement" to deanonymize Tor users, they would already do it. If I
remember correctly, the Tor project gets a lot of requests from law
enforcement to deanonymize Tor users for them, which indicates that they
can't do it themselves (Andrew Lewman would be able to say if I'm
correct or not). I've also never heard of a conviction obtained through the use of this
material, though sophisticated TLAs might not much care. I wonder what a
search through the email dumps leaked by Anonymous in the past year for
Tor would yield. If this attack were possible in the wild, I'd expect
one or more of those contractors to be using it.

Well, there are the following options:
      * John plays at level 0: he is insane
      * John plays at level 1: he is sane, pretending to be insane, and
        we are deceived by this (in this world, you play at level 2,
        Greg)
But it's also possible for a mask to lie beneath the mask, for him to be
insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane. And so on and so
forth all the way down the rabbit hole.
I'm sure if we asked him what level he played at, he'd only respond "one
level higher than you." It's definitely a great show.

Not much actual information, but it's nifty that bitcoin-mining malware
is maybe using Tor hidden services for command and control.

So from what it seems, the malware included a bitcoin miner that perhaps is
to report found blocks / sub-hashes (? is that a term; i.e. if it works in
a mining pool) to a server, perhaps this site in question.

In both cases, the very simplistic security measure raises the cost of
an attack out of the reach of a large class of attackers.
Using Bitcoin without Tor and generating a new address for each
transaction probably protects you against:
      * any moderately-skilled 14 year old
      * local law enforcement
      * your ISP
And several other classes of attacker below the level of, say, the FBI.
TAILS is just a system that forces all connections over Tor. There are
ways to force only specific applications to use Tor that the FBX can use
pretty easily. Since the FBX will write the FBX bitcoin client package,
it can configure bitcoin to, by default, only use Tor.
This isn't hard to do, and since this cheap measure puts Bitcoin out of
the reach of Dan Kaminsky, I'm not very worried about claims of
bitcoin's anonymity.
For reference, it's really, really, really hard to take web browsing and
make it anonymous. Forcing every connection from browsers to go through
Tor won't help you anywhere near as much as it does for Bitcoin. Bitcoin
has already done 99% of the hard work building a protocol that is
totally (as far as either of us can tell) anonymous if it's _just_
tunneled through Tor without any other filtering.

This particular script that is currently being hyped up on Reddit as
"de-anonymizing most Tor hidden servers" simply makes too many
assumptions to be feasible.
Yes, this sort of attack is feasible in principle, and this script will
probably work if you find a hidden service that is also a relay and is
also a publicly reachable HTTP server, but saying it can be carried out
against most hidden services is simply false as a matter of fact.
Hidden services don't need to be reachable from the Internet. They don't
need to have accurate clocks. And as a result, a lot of them aren't
vulnerable to a program on the Internet that is being marketed as
reliably de-anonymizing hidden services.
To summarize:
      * This is not a novel attack
      * This particular variant of the attack ("clockskewer") is not
        effective against many if not most hidden services
      * The people claiming it does on Reddit are scare-mongering Tor
        for karma, and that irritates me as someone who likes Tor and
        wants people who need more-secure systems to research Tor and
        see the stable, well-tested tool that it is, rather than hype
        from Reddit.

This implies a pretty easy business model:
      * rent botnet proxies at some cost
      * make google accounts over botnets, farming the captchas out at
        some other cost
      * sell google accounts for bitcoins at cost + other cost + profit

      * profit
You could probably do the account creation on-demand so you had no
inventory buildup, even. If you started getting lots of demand, you
could start pre-registering accounts.
This one's a freebie for anyone on this list with more time than me.
Since I have a Google account, I'd like to say that I will never do
this, as it would be against Google's ToS and as such, criminally
illegal (see

That's true, but they don't have the same phones. Plenty still don't

Where are you getting that number from?
As a current college student, I think that getting a thousand users is a
huge stretch. There are maybe a handful of clicktivist types that would
actually install something, on a mobile device or a larger computer;
there's a slightly larger handful that would think it's cool; the vast

because they'd see it as stealing (MAFIAA propaganda works).

This is a specific instance of a very large ongoing debate in multiple
different struggles, between supporters of strict pacifism/legalism and
supporters of a diversity of tactics.
I think that if you are uncomfortable with taking direct action to
liberate scientific knowledge, you can still be a valuable participant
in this broader movement, using tactics and strategies like the one
you've described.
However, I feel that it's wrong to condemn those who are willing to take
those risks, and betray whatever institutions give them privilege.
If we want any movement to grow, we need to be ready to accept a diverse
range of tactics from comrades that we may or may not agree with on
questions of specific actions, but that we must support writ large,
since they are fighting the same battle we are, and we would ask the
same of them.
So to conclude: you've presented a good idea, and I will support you if
you are persecuted for using it, as long as you recognize that those who
publish things as the open access guerilla cookbook are trying to
achieve the same goals as you, and you support their work towards those
