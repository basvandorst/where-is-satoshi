@_subject: Netscape Export + 128bits SSL (?) 
We are very curious about security + standard + on the shelf products, because so the market will use more naturally the cryptography.
Do you know if it's possible to use Netscape client (export = 40bits RC4) on an external SSL layer (i.e., with full encryption, RC4 long keys or IDEA)?
Use extra-US implantation (SSL-Leavy or AppacheSSL, etc.) the IDEA option?
It seems that IDEA is no longer supported by SSL 3 (in the cipher suite we see IDEA with RSA but not with D-H).
Are rumors on additional algorithms (e.g., Safer SK128, Blowfish, etc.)?
On the S-HTTP side, are some non-US implantation (browser or server) available or some US-freeware that is smuggled out?
Thanks for your answers.

@_subject: Tao Renji Public Key system 
Dear Bruce,
I was testing the Raike's Public Key software, when I remembered a section of your excellent book.
In Applied Cryptography, second edition, section 19.10 (page 482) you present the Renji's work about a public key algorithme based on finite automata.
Where could we found the FAPKC1 and FAPKC2 algorithms, their implementations, and executable versions (you mention an Intel486 test).
Many thanks,
With kindest regards

@_subject: overseas PGPfone and Netscape 
I've seen some threads about (1) the new PGPfone, (2) the new US-version of Netscape and leakage.
So my question:
[Important] Do you know some non-US URL with the latest version of PGPfone for Win?
(I monitored the usual European repositories quasi day to day, but it was always the old version)
[Less important] Ibid. for the new US-Netscape (with full 128-SSL)
(I suppose there is a copyright problem for such a -hum- mirroring)

Very good idea, and nice implemantation of the idea.
Please, let us know of the new version.
Would be a minimal information about cyphering vs scrambling, secret vs public key system, useful for the newbies and not redondant with the large classical FAQ.

Not only, in France too. Circa twenty years ago a man booby-trapped his secondary house (a radio set with explosive) and was successfully sued by the burglar for damages.
I think it is also the point of view of the central european society.

@_subject: PGP API & PGP 3.0 
I'm considering the use of PGP for bank operation in central Europe (and yes, also in France, but there -normaly- only for interbank fund transfers).
I have seen the PGP API stuff, but I don't know where and I haven't seen any commentaries by users.
I don't know the current state of the PGP 3.0 effort and the intermediate results, nor the respective relation of PGP API and PGP 3.0 (which has also an API).
Thanks for your advice,

This a thesis by Michael Paul Johnson for is Master of Science degree (1989), and a free softwar (date: 12/21/1995).
Schneier's Applied Cryptography doesn't say anything about MPJ or Diamond.
