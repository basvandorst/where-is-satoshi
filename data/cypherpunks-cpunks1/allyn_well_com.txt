Use PGP.
If you want to blab without being traced, go to the local public library
or netcafe. Some airports now have netcafe's that accept cash without
As a sysadmin, I often have to troubleshoot mail. That exposes me to
email. I try only to look at headers and ignore bodies, but I am

I just respond with stupid answares like putting water in
a jelly jar in the freezer or forget the xxx passwords; undress

I like the idea, however it could be a management nightmare.
How would you meter the http vs https traffic? How would you
meter the pgp email vs the non pgp email? Many pgp emails
(including mine) have some non encrypted stuff in it (such
as the sentance 'PGP message follows' or whatever.
Good Luck!

I'm not.
If it's the same Denning, I think that she's busy taking advantage of the cooler weather to get some good in-line skating in. That name
was mentioned while I was active in an in-line skating club back
east before I moved here to Seattle.
Washington gets very hot during the summer and outdoor sports are just about impossible until about now. If this is the same persion, I would be suprised to see her any
where near a computer until the rains arrive later in the fall/winter.

Or how about a man wearing a pair of briefs under a wedding dress (and
full length veil) made out of crystal clear plastic. You think I am kidding? I saw it at a private party. I thought it looked
great! I suggested to him to wear it at gay pride.
