Hi.  I appreciate your interest in Cable Descramblers and Cable equipment.
If you are interested in a brand new DIGITAL CABLE DESCRAMBLER that decodes and receives ALL CHANNELS and is compatible with ALL "DIGITAL" and "ANALOG" CABLE SYSTEMS then please get back to me. Thats right.  This Descrambler works with DIGITAL cable.
Let me know.
