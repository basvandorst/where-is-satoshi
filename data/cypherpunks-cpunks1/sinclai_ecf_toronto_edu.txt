A mag-strip may be copied from one card to another with a steady hand and
a dubbing tape deck.  I'd hazard instead one could read the data into
a computer via a sound card and edit it to taste.  Then drop it back on that
or another card by the same method.
This works for things like library photo-copy cards.  I don't know if others,
like bank cards, require a stronger field to write.  Also, there are probably
checksums or hashes on bank/ID cards.

@_subject: Secure DAC? 
I was looking through the PMI analog IC databook from 1988.  Specifically,
I was looking at the "DAC-08 8-bit high-speed multiplying D/A converter".
The chip is interesting in that it has two outputs.  One is the current
corresponding to the digital value on the input lines, and the other is
the current corresponding to NOT the digital values.  Thus, the two currents
sum to a constant.  The book says:
    "Power consuption may be calculated as follows:
    Pd = (I+) (V+) + (I-) (V-).  A useful feature of the DAC-08 design
    is that supply current is constand and independent of input logic states;
    this is useful in cryptographic applications and further serves to
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    reduce the size of the power supply bypass capacitors."
        -- Page 11-34.  All typos mine.
I fail to see how this would increase cryptographic potential.  However, it would seem to mask the device's EMR.  The application notes state that
it is useful in CRT display drivers, audio encoders, &c.  These are all
devices that are succeptable to TEMPEST monitoring (or whatever the
correct name is).  If one output goes to the desired next stage (the
electron gun in a CRT for example) and the other goes to a matched dummy
load, it would seem that the overall EMR is constant.  This approach
would obliviate the need for bulky shielding, though it might not be as secure.

I hope not.  If such a thing existed (if I understand your description

the number of bits in the key.

@_subject: Prime magnitude and keys...a ? 
I think you misunderstand.  Perry and I are talking about the
algormithm (If it exists) being O(log_2(n)).  That is, "log base 2 of n".
This means that the time taken is proportional to the log to the base
two of the number of keys.
Fascinating as this speculation is, I see no way to craft such
an algorithm.  The nature of the modular space makes "larger"
and "smaller" difficult to distinguish.

By the same token, I might say that to communicate in a scholarly manner

However, I will not.  As has been pointed out, each of us learned the
basic principles of math and cryptography somewhere.  If we can, in the
course of our discussions, bring others up to that level of understanding
then we will have accomplished much.
Certainly "big O notation" and the modulo operator are studied in undergrad
computer science and mathematics.  However, many of us have never studied
these things.  There are a number of high-school students on the list.  There
are people who have never had the oportunity to study technical subjects.
IMHO, these people are all welcome on cypherpunks and have much to contribute.
When I first joined the list, I was a self taught programmer and had never
been taught the formalisms of "big O notation".  We must not become a self-congratulatory elite.

Makes sense, doesn't it?  When the whitehouse guy said that encryption
below clipper was legal but not above, we thought he was confused.  However,
we ACKed it with an NSA employee, and he confirmed it.  His reasoning went
like this:  encryption below clipper can't be stopped, since one can just
splice a cryptdec into the phone line.  Encryption on top of clipper is
impossible since the clipper phone will only accept audio input.  No
word on how that would effect clipper modems.
Having said all this, I should note that the NSA employee was not acting

@_subject: Message Havens 
Downloading the whole message base to scan for one's messages
will place a massive load on net.resources, and probably
a prohibitive load on most people's terminals.  This scheme
should avoid this nescessity:
Alice wishes to write a message anonymously to Bob.  They have
agreed in previous communications that their tag is the string "foo".
Alice writes her messages, and encrypts it with Bob's public key.
She then prepends the tag.  It looks like this:
Tag: foo
--- Begin Pgp Message ---
--- End Pgp Message ---
Next, she encrypts this with the gopherhole's public key.  The
resulting message is posted to the gopherhole, where it is decrypted
and made available for all to download.
Now, Bob enters the gopherhole and instructs it to download all
messages with the tag of "foo".  To thwart trafic volume analysis,
he also downloads messages with tags "bar", "baz" and "quux", which
he then discards.
The gopherhole must be trusted not to divulge which posts
came from who, and it's key must not be compromized.
A tap on Bob's line shows that he /may/ have a connection with
the "foo" tag.  However, the only person that knows anything
about that tag is Alice.  Thus, the other party in the conversation
must colaborate in an attack, probably ruining her anonymity.

A "gopherhole" and "message haven" are the same thing.
We were using the term "gopherhole" because it was suggested that
gopher be used as the underlying mechanism for a message haven.
Yes.  Under this model, a message haven must be trusted.
This flavour of message haven would not require persistent tables.
A crooked operator /could/ maintain them, but unlike penet they are
not required.  Every time you log into a message haven, you tell it
what tags you are interested in.  Here the level of trust is similar
to that of a regular remailer.  The remailer /could/ keep logs to
destroy your anonymity, but we hope it doesn't.
I realize this solution is far from ideal.  But as I posted before,
I don't believe the numbers favour a message haven where everything
is downloaded.  I have this nagging feeling that there is some
very elegant cryptographical way of doing this employing secret
sharing, but I can't actually think of how to do it.

However, as I see it PGP 2.5 (or 2.6) is only illegal

problem is the export of PGP 2.5 from the US, which

So:  US users can legally use PGP 2.5.  Foreign users
can also use PGP 2.5 until the US decides to kidnap them.

I disagree.  If we assume that RC4 and DES can be run at the same speed
(I don't know how true this is) then 80 bit RC4 is 2^24 times harder
to break than DES.  That's 16 million.  A machine that will crack
DES in one day is of the order of one million dollars.  It would take
50,000 years to crack 80-bit RC4.  Alternativly, a one-day crack
would cost 16 trillion dollars.  I feel safe with those numbers.
Certainly, for the most paranoid 128 bit IDEA is better than an
80 bit RC4.  However, to say that it is unsuitable for anyone is
a vast stretch.  Considering it probably has a better user-interface
than SecureDrive, it may be more suitable for the average person.

I have a guess as to IPG's "OTP" expansion algorithm.  The clue is the
prime wheels.  It reminded me of something I read in Kahn that was originally
done with paper tape.
Take two random streams, A and B.  Their lengths are relatively prime.  Let's
use 1000 and 999.  An expanded stream C is computed thus:
C[i] = A[i % 1000] ^ B[i % 999]
C thus does not repeat until 999000 values have gone past.  Using more than
two relatively prime wheels will produce very large streams.  The key,
of course, is that *the entropy does not increase*.  I am sure that this
sort of expansion is vulnerable to attack.  It certainly does not warrant
the name OTP.
Am I close, Ralph?

I wouldn't fault them on that.  For example, let's say they have a

any samples that have less than 450 or more than 550.
They have thrown away a number of bits of entropy here.  Somewhere
between 10 and 100 at a guess -- my combinatorics is nonexistant.
So what?  There are plenty of bits there still.  If they really
are using 5600 bit keys, they can afford to lose some and still be
invulnerable to brute-force attacks.
What they have gained is the knowledge that their random number source
isn't broken.  If your RNG started spewing 0 bits by the thousand would
you say "This stream is just as likely as any other stream that I can
imagine so there is no problem", or "My RNG is broken".  Of course,
in nice mathematical abstractions your RNG never breaks, but we live in
a nasty world of thermal failiures and cold solder joints.

Cypherpunks isn't the right place to discuss this in detail, but...
Efficiency != Cheap
Kerosene is cheap.  Steel fuel tanks and rocket motors are quite cheap.
Making big dumb rockets is well understood.  However, aircraft integration
is not.  If you use an 'off-the-shelf' aircraft, it has a human in it.
That means the whole thing must be safe.  If you don't, you have a drone
aircraft which isn't cheap at all.  Remember, the cost of materials
scales linearly with size.  The cost of a complex system scales as the
square of the parts count.
These arguments are hashed out (admittedly without consensus) regularly
in the sci.space newsgroups.

I am a Canadian student, so my education is largely funded by the state
using stolen money.  Do I deserve privacy?  Do people receiving welfare
deserve privacy?

@_subject: another thought about random numbers 
My recollection was Quebec, Canada.  There were articles posted to the
list at the time, so it should be in the archives if anyone cares enough
to look it up.

Graphical rendering is one place where I might like a cycle
market.  Finite element simulation is another.

I don't have a C2 account, and don't really want to pay for one.
I trust someone will put the hackerpunks archives on the web so
the rest of us can read them.

My understanding was that it couldn't be patented in Canada, because
Canadian law does not acknowledge patents on algorithms.

@_subject: reputation capital transaction 
In anticipation of the upcoming Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference,
I'd like to transfer some reputation capital between accounts.
I ported RC4 to the HP48 calculator.  A bignum package capable of RSA and Diffie-Hellman is coming soon.

A friend of mine registered as a student for the CFP '96 conference
next week, but is unable to go.  Registration is transferable, so he
can send another student in his place.  If anyone is interested, please
mail him (not me) at tew2 at cornell.edu.

Not that random playing with carcinogenic chemicals is a good idea, but...
I've found that if you use just one reagent from epoxy glue, the collagen
in your skin will disolve.  You can sculpt it into whatever shape you want,
and it will stay that way for an hour or so.  I don't remember if it was
the resin or the hardener though.  This was regular 5 minute epoxy.

@_subject: Mission Impossible 
I saw Mission Impossible last night.  It deals with some cypherpunks issues,
as the plot centers on anonymous BlackNet style operations on the Internet.
Unfortunately, it does it badly.  Particularly silly is the reference that
a STU-III is a security penetration device.  The main hacker is called
Luthor, though he doesn't look a thing like Lex.  The Usenet is dealt
with in a laughable manner -- a grep of the entire 'net for "Job" doesn't
turn up a single hit.
Having said all of that, lots of things explode.  It's good in THX.

@_subject: Tempest Info 
The high-frequency harmonics from your computers are probably above the
cutoff frequency of the water-pipes when considered as circular waveguides.
The water filling will act as a dielectric, bringing F0 down.  So, it
is conceivable that extremely high frequency radiation (>3 Ghz) could
propagate well in a water pipe.
