Two points:  the CSP development kit is export-controlled; and signing a
CSP developed by a foreign vendor is treated as a export -- so the signature
is export-controlled.
We would ship a CSP development kit to a foreign vendor, and sign a CSP
developed by the foreign vendor, but only with the appropriate export licenses.
Would you sign a foreign-developed CSP (which isn't subject to the rules)?

I attended a meeting at Microsoft the other day at which they
described their Crypto API project.  As CAPIs go, it's reasonable
enough; nothing particularly exciting about it or especially wrong
with it (though they don't yet support nonblocking calls to crypto
(or will have soon) an application development kit to allow you to
write code that uses the API, and a CSP development kit to let you
write the crypto functions.
issue is whether MS will really sign anyone's CSP or whether they will
start charging high fees or making business-based decisions on who's
CSPs they will allow (with they sign Netscape's CSP, for example).
They say they won't even look or keep a copy of your CSP (at my
suggestion, they are probably going to change the process so that you
send them a hash of your CSP instead of your CSP code when you get the
signature).  For now they promise to sign CSPs for anyone who returns
the export certificate, at no charge.
say that the API kit will not be export-controlled but the CSP kit
will be.
