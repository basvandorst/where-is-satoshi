I appreciate Sandy's enlightened and consistent position.
And I will stand with anyone who supports free speech and privacy.
Forgive my week character however, if I am forced to hold my nose while I
stand with her on this issue.
She is the type of free speach advocate who supports the freedom of those
who agree with *her*.
She is no friend of *mine*

                        Ben Franklin
Original quote by Ben Franklin when the British government published
(stolen?) private letters of
John Adams to his wife critical  of Franklyn and other members of the
Continental Congress.
The Britsh hoped to drive a wedge into the congress and especially between
Adams % Franklin.
Franklin was a gentleman.

I vote for Anonymous.
Also, it seems evident that some non-anonymous posters aka KTOM seem to understand how to *abuse*  our American freedom's but don't understand about
*responsible*  use.
Is this a deliberate attempt to damage this list or is it that some folk
just can't handle freedom?

I am sure you know the reason for the 'civil rights violation laws.
In the 50's & early 60's, all while jury's in the deep south refusing to
convict obviously guilty white defendants of rape and  murder against blacks.
What would be *your* remedy in such cases.

I got some chuckles from your  'Flame Form' and sympathize with view
expressed therein.
How do you propose that we get our import  message of strong crypto
awareness out to the clueless if we display elitism, impatience and
intolerance to their ignorance?
