OpenSSL version 0.9.6 Beta 1
  ============================
  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
    OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The first beta is now released.
  This beta is in fact two releases, one for the current mainstream
  OpenSSL, and one with an "engine" branch incorporated.  The "engine"
  branch contains an interface to external crypto libraries, which is
  currently used to support the hardware devices CryptoSwift (by CryptoSwift
  Inc), Atalla (by Compaq) and CHIL (previously called HWCryptoHook, by
  nCipher) as well as the internal OpenSSL routines.
  The two beta releases are available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
      o     o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/
  The file names of the two betas are:
    o openssl-0.9.6-beta1.tar.gz
    o openssl-engine-0.9.6-beta1.tar.gz
  Please download and test it as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL version
  incorporates 75 changes and bugfixes to the toolkit (for a complete list

  soon.  Tests on other platforms should be made very soon as well,
  to verify that we haven't messed up since last beta.

OpenSSL version 0.9.6 released
  ===============================
  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
    The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of version
  0.9.6 of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new OpenSSL version
  is a major release and incorporates at least 91 changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see   The most significant changes are:
      o Some documentation for BIO and SSL libraries.
      o Enhanced chain verification using key identifiers.
      o New sign and verify options to 'dgst' application.
      o Support for DER and PEM encoded messages in 'smime' application.
      o New 'rsautl' application, low level RSA utility.
      o MD4 now included.
      o Bugfix for SSL rollback padding check.
      o Support for external crypto devices [1].
      o Enhanced EVP interface.
  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.6 to be the best version of OpenSSL available and we
  strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of old SSLeay
  versions, upgrade as soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.6 is available for
  download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (you can find
  the various FTP mirrors under     o     o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/
  [1] OpenSSL comes in the form of two distributions this time.
  The reasons for this is that we want to deploy the external crypto device
  support but don't want to have it part of the "normal" distribution just
  yet.  The distribution containing the external crypto device support is
  popularly called "engine", and is considered experimental.  It's been
  fairly well tested on Unix and flavors thereof.  If run on a system with
  no external crypto device, it will work just like the "normal" distribution.
  The distribution file names are:
      o openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz [normal]
      o openssl-engine-0.9.6.tar.gz [engine]

OpenSSL version 0.9.6f released
  ===============================
  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
    The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of version
  0.9.6f of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new OpenSSL version
  is a security and bugfix release and incorporates several changes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see   The most significant changes are:
      o Various important bugfixes.
  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.6f to be the best version of OpenSSL available
  and we strongly recommend that users of older versions upgrade as
  soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.6f is available for download via HTTP
  and FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various
  FTP mirrors under     o     o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/
  [1] OpenSSL comes in the form of two distributions this time.
  The reasons for this is that we want to deploy the external crypto device
  support but don't want to have it part of the "normal" distribution just
  yet.  The distribution containing the external crypto device support is
  popularly called "engine", and is considered experimental.  It's been
  fairly well tested on Unix and flavors thereof.  If run on a system with
  no external crypto device, it will work just like the "normal" distribution.
  The distribution file names are:
      o openssl-0.9.6f.tar.gz [normal]
        MD5 checksum: 160ac38bd2784e633ed291d03f0087d4

        MD5 checksum: 26f4b7189fb3ef9c701e961ffe101a95

@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] OpenSSL 0.9.7 beta 4 released 
The fourth beta release of OpenSSL 0.9.7 is now available from the
  OpenSSL FTP site .  This beta
  contains numerous fixes (among others, security-related ones) since
  beta 3, which explains the long time that has passed between the
  two.
  This is NOT a final beta.  Beta 5, which is planned to be the final
  one, will be released in two weeks if everything works well.  The
  final release of OpenSSL 0.9.7 is scheduled for Tuesday 2002-12-10.
  To make sure that it will work correctly, please test beta 4
  thoroughly, for example with your favorite piece of software, and
  please report back to us!  Also, please test on as many platforms as
  you have available and you have time for, especially on less common
  platforms.
  If you're interested in helping further, please join the
  openssl-dev at openssl.org list, where test requests on specific
  development snapshots will be announced.
  Changes between 0.9.7 beta 3 and 0.9.7 beta 4 include:
      o Support for new platforms: Windows CE, Tandem OSS, A/UX, AIX 64-bit
      o Extended support for some platforms: VxWorks
      o Enhanced support for shared libraries.
      o Support for pkg-config.
      o Lots of new manuals.
      o A few new engines added in the demos area.
  The full set of changes between 0.9.6{x} and 0.9.7 beta 4 include:
      o New library section OCSP.
      o Complete rewrite of ASN1 code.
      o CRL checking in verify code and openssl utility.
      o Extension copying in 'ca' utility.
      o Flexible display options in 'ca' utility.
      o Provisional support for international characters with UTF8.
      o Support for external crypto devices ('engine') is no longer
        a separate distribution.
      o New elliptic curve library section.
      o New AES (Rijndael) library section.
      o Support for new platforms: Windows CE, Tandem OSS, A/UX, AIX 64-bit
      o Extended support for some platforms: VxWorks
      o Enhanced support for shared libraries.
      o Support for pkg-config.
      o Lots of new manuals.
      o Change DES API to clean up the namespace (some applications link also
        against libdes providing similar functions having the same name).
        Provide macros for backward compatibility (will be removed in the
        future).
      o Unify handling of cryptographic algorithms (software and engine)
        to be available via EVP routines for asymmetric and symmetric ciphers.
      o NCONF: new configuration handling routines.
      o Change API to use more 'const' modifiers to improve error checking
        and help optimizers.
      o Finally remove references to RSAref.
      o Reworked parts of the BIGNUM code.
      o Support for new engines: Broadcom ubsec, Accelerated Encryption
        Processing, IBM 4758.
      o A few new engines added in the demos area.
      o Extended and corrected OID (object identifier) table.
      o PRNG: query at more locations for a random device, automatic query for
        EGD style random sources at several locations.
      o SSL/TLS: allow optional cipher choice according to server's preference.
      o SSL/TLS: allow server to explicitly set new session ids.
      o SSL/TLS: support Kerberos cipher suites (RFC2712).
      o SSL/TLS: allow more precise control of renegotiations and sessions.
      o SSL/TLS: add callback to retrieve SSL/TLS messages.
      o SSL/TLS: support AES cipher suites (RFC3268).
