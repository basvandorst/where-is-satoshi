Dear Sir/Madam   logoffice.Com   US$ 640 Please note that after years, the registration on the domain name  logoffice.Com  was not renewed and this   domain had become available to  register.  Consequently, we have been approached to market this domain name that has  been tracked and registered by a client.    As result,logoffice.Com  now  available from us for IMMEDIATE transfer.    With so many companies that could benefit from this domain, along with  what many would consider to be a "wholesale   price", we hope to secure a  quick transfer.  Please note that the domain name market is extremely solid at the moment  and  similar domains are currently selling on   afternic.com, greatdomains.com  (domain auction sites) and by domain name brokers, in some cases, for many  thousands   of US dollars.   Please note that transfers take just 15 minutes and are extremely  straightforward - absolutely NO technical knowledge   required!  For our client's peace of mind, we use an escrow service for all  transactions and domains are ALWAYS secured   by the buyer prior to us  receiving any funds. We pay all fees connected with the escrow process.   If you would like to use Www.logoffice.Com  for your online business,    please contact us at your earliest convenience. We will be on hand should you require any   further assistance or information.   We thank you for your attention and sincerely apologise if this e-mail has  not been of interest to you.   Yours sincerely,   MO,  Sales,  Marketing P-Z
