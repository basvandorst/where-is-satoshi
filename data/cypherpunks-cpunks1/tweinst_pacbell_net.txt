No, not really. Until you can show me an Internet Draft for a solution to phishing that requires that we give up SSL, I don't see any reason to do so. As a consumer, I'd be very reluctant to give up SSL for credit card transactions because I use it all the time and it makes me feel safer.
If you don't know what we can do about phishing, why do you think that getting rid of SSL is a necessary first step? You seem to be putting the cart in front of the horse.
