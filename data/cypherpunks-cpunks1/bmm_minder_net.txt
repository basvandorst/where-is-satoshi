A cypherpunks distributed list node is now available at
cypherpunks at minder.net.  I would appreciate it if the current CDR ops
would add a feed to this address.  Thanks.

Amen.  In my experience, no network I've _ever_ been associated with
(private, public, miltary, or whatever) has ever proactively pursued a
security model.  Security has always been defined as preventing a
well-defined (and well-experienced) exploit from being repeatedly used.
Rainbow series, feh!  Even the folks who should know better call NT4 C2
compliant.  CYA is the TLA of the day.

@_subject: Announce - "Registration" Mail List 
In order to relieve the CDR list of some of the flood of "You have
successfully registered" messages, and because some people feel there
is a need for such a thing, I have created a new mailing list for the
specific purpose of being used for registering for online services,
reg at minder.net.  Subject lines of mail from the list with be prepended
with "[r]" for easy filtering, whether automated or by eye.
It is a majordomo list, so those who are familiar with majordomo can
subscribe in the usual fashion.  For those who are not familar with
majordomo, to subscribe send a message to "majordomo at minder.net" with
"subscribe reg" (without the quotes) in the body of the message.

@_subject: Announce: "secret-admirers" mail list 
I would like to announce the "secret-admirers" mail list.
The "secret-admirers" list is intended to function in a manner similar
to the well-known Usenet newsgroup "alt.anonymous.messages".  This
newsgroup serves as a dead drop for communications in which the recipient
wishes to remain unknown.
While access to a Usenet news server is unavailable in many environments, the ubiquity and flexibility of e-mail may be advantageous for the
following reasons:
- Penetration:  More people having access to (pseudo|ano)nymizing tools                 is generally a good thing.
- Pool Size:    Higher utilization of the message pool may frustrate
                traffic analysis.  The list may be gatewayed back into
                alt.anonymous.messages or vice versa.  CDR-like
                nodes for redistribution may be established to reduce
                load on individual nodes.
- Filtering:    E-mail filtering tools are widely available, allowing
                recipients to draw only pertinent messages from the
                pool by filtering on tokens which have been negotiated
                out-of-band or by the public key to which a message has
                been encrypted.
The mail list is unmoderated and accepts messages from any submitter.
Submissions may be sent to "secret-admirers at minder.net" or
"sa at minder.net".
TO SUBSCRIBE to the list, send a message with "subscribe secret-admirers"
in the body to majordomo at minder.net.  The more subscribers, the better,
even if procmail just sends it to /dev/null.
TO UNSUBSCRIBE from the list, send a message with "unsubscribe
secret-admirers" to majordomo at minder.net.
A digest of this list is available.  This list is not currently archived.

@_subject: Announce: "secret-admirers" mail list 
By CDR-like, I meant that it might be useful to grow the list in a manner
similar to the cypherpunks list in order both to protect against SPoF as
well as to distribute load (alt.anonymous.messages is pretty high-traffic
- even compared to cypherpunks).  How nodes would connect is TBD.  Most
CDR admins have rolled their own method of doing this.  --

Sure.  Maybe "sa at minder.net" is an address one should keep in mind when
registering on the website of some company you don't particularly want to
receive junk mail from.

The list is gatewayed from/to alt.anonymous.messages, which provides a bit
more cover.  I agree that it would be more useful as an extension of
a.a.m than standalone.

Servers probably by default log whetever authentication is required to
access them, ie. an IP address where there's an ACL by IP or a username
where a USERAUTH is required.
The News administrator may log as much or as little as he chooses.  This
is why others have suggested one read read news from a server or one has
control over.  A caching proxy configured correctly would be the next best
Managing a news feed is neat experience to have done once, but I don't
think I'd want to make a career out of it.  Popular server packages go a
long way toward reducing the administrative burden, including allowing the
administrator to tweak logging up or down as he deems appropriate.

@_subject: CDR: Re: ssz.com network trouble 
cyberpass has "lost" its subscriber list at least once, so you might want
to confirm that you actually are currently subscribed.  SSZ has occasional
extended downtimes and the charming CDR prefix.  I'm unsure of the status
of algebra.com, as Igor has asked me to deliver to those who were
subscribed there.  That leaves openpgp.net and minder.net.  Anyone with
some dedicated, reliable bandwidth want to run a node?  bmm at minder.net                                                1024/8C7C4DE9

Perhaps the penet remailer, which shut down in 9/96, is the one being
referred to. See   If memory serves, it was by far the
most popular (pseudo|ano)nymous of the time.

The "secret-admirers" list strips all headers (except the Subject:) from
submissions and is gatewayed to/from alt.anonymous.messages.  The list
intro may be found below.  If there was enough interest, it could be
hooked up to the CDR instead, or made standalone.  I would like to announce the "secret-admirers" mail list.

Sircam is indeed the culprit.  minder.net usually delivers from 10^5 to
10^6 messages a day.  Since this latest worm the average has risen by
an order of magnitude, though things have slowed down quite a bit in the
last 24 hours.  We're working though the backlog.
As some of the mail I deliver is for paying, privacy oriented customers
I'm obliged not to peek or filter to mitigate the situation as Eric has

These are likely due to disks filling up at ssz (due to SirCam).

I've been using 128000 for some time, as this sort of problem has arisen
in the past.  The overhead looks negligible.  Also, it seems like long
message-id's sometimes get munged at lne.com just enough to fool formail.
Any thoughts?
