This is a good one.  What about the other half of American life (the
uncivilized?). You know, the americans who live in those old
refrigerator cartons? The ones that nobody sees?  I think they get more
than 2 weeks out of their shirts.
The sad fact is that city brats haven't got the faintest idea what
survival is all about  (you mean I have to *walk* to the supermarket?).
It was in the 1890's when Queen Victoria issued an edict that forced all
the english to 'bathe at least once a year'.

One obvious advantage to living in the penthouse of a highrise.  Of
course, the elevators may not be working. The elevator shaft may make an
effective latrine though.
City people may be up to their eyeballs in sh*t.  This requires the
availability of raw materiel to produce however, which is predicated on
gas pumps working to fuel transportation of foodstuffs into the hive.  I
suppose horses could make a come-back, but then we're back to piles of
sh*t again.
Current waste disposal conventions such as sewers and trash removal
don't actually magically make this stuff disappear.  In NYC it all ends
up in the Atlantic latrine, where it gets picked up by the gulf stream
and ends up being deposited on Florida beaches after a long sea journey.
There are so many plastic bags bearing logos in the sargasso sea, it
looks like it has been sold off to corporate interests for advertizing
I went out fishing in this vicinity a few weeks ago and caught 3 sea
birds (released alive) and only one fish.  On thinking it over, it was
obvious why we caught the birds -- there aren't any fish to catch, so
the birds were hungry enough to go for a lure. Colloform counts in the
mid-Atlantic approach that of an unwashed WC.
Its no better on the other coast, in San Francisco there is an annual
paragraph in the Chron, usually buried near the last page, about (yet)
another *accidental* release of 12 million gallons of raw untreated
sewage, into the bay.  Funny how these accidents happen in december
every year.  We really are the society that believes in *out of sight,
out of mind* solutions.
There is an opportunity in this I suppose,  corner the market on
chemical toilets and reverse osmosis water makers in a big city next
year, and you're laughing. Of course your exit strategy should take into
account the possibility of being taken over in the *public good*.
Hong Kong has a good system for dealing with the flush problem.  When
the sewer system was put in (Japanese occupied, WWII period), all
buildings were double plumbed with fresh water for drinking, cooking and
washing, and sea water for flushing.  With the way most city water
tastes now, maybe the existing plumbing could be turned over to
non-potable water distribution for washing + flushing.  Distribution of
drinking water would be as it is in LA today.
That's the fun part, figuring out how it could all be made to work.
Unfortunately it's more likely that the sheeple will cry out for guvmint
intervention to continue the flow of goodies, to which the western world
has become addicted.
IMHO, the military will be brought in to dig the latrines. Hoarders will
be strung up for not redistributing their wealth in approved socialist
style. Rewards will be posted for informing on a neighbor who is (may
be) a hoarder (5% of the take?). Gas will be reclassified as a public
resource for the duration of the emergency. The military will bring in
the K rations, until it becomes obvious that relocating the
citizen-units to resettlement camps on the outskirts is easier to
manage.  Those who control the sources of food production will also be
drafted into this new(er) deal. Anyone left over from this
redistribution, will be classified as a public enemy and fair game.
This is the perfect opportunity for the state to offer more security in
exchange for reduced liberty.
Was it on this list that I saw the posting about the 300 trucks of army
rations a day being stashed in some Oklahoma(?) caves?

I used to be an anarcho-capitalist, but concluded I was far too selfish. In fact, if
you'd read the first line about the libertarian compromize, rather than looking for
hooks, you'd see that I was attempting rapprochement.  Mostly I'm not at all
interested in being drawn into political wastings of energy, life is too short.  I
made my choice 25 years ago, and have been (largely) free and untaxed for that time.
Harry Browne's "How I found freedom in an unfree world" came along at about the same
time I cut loose from the nation-state.
Why the pejorative use of "anarcho-whatever" and the whole personal level at which you
pitch your responses?  Is it your intent to stir up anger by using imflammatory
rhetoric?  Or (more likely) is this an example of newspeak? Whatever, it comes across
as mean-spirited and sad. An indicator perhaps, of someone who loves to "go for the
jugular".  A common "small man" trait. Are you a small man Jim? Do you need the power
of the state to make you feel big by proxy?
One thing the anarcho-capitalist rants all contain, is frustration at being under the
thumb of authority.  They believe that outlawing big thumbs will fix this.  Until that
happy day (should it ever occur), I have perceived that big thumbs are very clumsy. I
prefer to move rapidly enough that they have difficulty in pinning me down, numbering
me, punching and spindling me.  My domiciles tend to be in nation-states that provide
safe havens to those who have stuff that the big thumbs would like to expropriate. I
visited and left the US at about the time the streets paved with gold turned to the
streets paved with goldbrickers.
Some of the socialist propaganda leaked out in your posting.  Why would I be concerned
about curing "social ills"?  I'm fully tied up in interacting with my own little
society -- my parents, siblings, children, friends, pets, possessions.  Why would I
need or desire any other (arbitrary) social connections?  I don't have your missionary
zeal I suppose. All such change that I could effect would be as nothing, seen from the
perspective of 100 years in the future. I'd hate to be branded as a 'deadbeat dad' by
my nakama because I was paying more attention to righting abstract wrongs, than
reading to my children. Pillory Klinton was almost correct; it does take a village, or
buggering off to live in one and leaving the neo-roman empiricists to prop up their
ailing support system without me.
If you are more concerned about addressing social ills than your personal life, I feel
sorry for you.  If you want to make a contribution to the social ills I have
accumulated however, I'll send you my numbered account details and you can deposit
Go find it yourself.  I'm not a charitable or state institution.  Here's a hint though

@_subject: most of what govts do can be done by business, and done better (Re: How to solve the tax problem w/o anarchy or force) 
There is a real live example of this kind of transition.  New Zealand.
New Zealand is the nation that coined the term 'cradle to grave
socialism' (and also the first to offer women the vote --
coincidence?).  In 1986, the country was as close to bankrupt as was
possible to be.  The socialists were ousted and taxes slashed from 60+%
to 28%.  A GST was introduced, government monopolies were sold off --
mail delivery, post offices, power generation, water supplies, telephone
service, ports, airports, medical, road maintenance etc. Military
investment was reduced to a coast guard and a professional
infrastructure required for UN involvement.
The (almost) immediate result of this divestiture, was for affluence to
skyrocket due to the release of the entrepreneurial spirit (remember the
kiwi-fruit?) By the early '90s New Zealand was upgraded from 17th
standard of living in the world, to 3rd. Since then, taxes have been cut
thrice more.  Currently income taxes are at 21% and plans have been made
to eliminate them entirely in '00.  The entire economy is supported by
the GST of 12.5% (consumption tax).
Welfare still exists, although the population is steadily being weaned
off it.  Most of the diehard dole-bludgers have moved to Australia
(coinciding with a move of many businesses from Australia in the reverse
direction), which still has a 45% income tax rate to support them.  Much
to the chagrin of the doomsaying socialists, the standard of living
actually improved for all the population.  The atmosphere of economic
repression was replaced by cheerful optimism within 6 months of the
transition, and has been growing ever since. Currently, along with
Argentina, New Zealand is the only other country in the world to be in
the black.
Income taxes were kept on solely for the purpose of eliminating foreign
debt. This is due to be completed by '00.  The change in people's
attitudes has been radical. During the latest asian economic crisis, New
Zealand found itself severely affected by the decrease in its markets. Rather than a return to printing money and increased taxation, New
Zealand has further reduced its tax burden in the belief that the free
market will find the correct solution.
One other interesting change happened at the same time as the above. During the post world war II period, New Zealand (and Australia) were
afflicted by something that was known down-under as the 'English
disease' -- viz: trade unionism.  This second government was virtually
abolished in New Zealand by the passing of the Employment Contracts Act
of 1986.  Under this act, all people are considered to be self-employed
in the sense that everyone has the right to negotiate their own
employment contract, or to collectively bargain as they see fit. What
this means, is that there is no single standard of employer to employee
relationship defined by the government (or trade union).  For a
corporation to require exclusivity of its hired help is considered to be
an invalid employment contract under the act. Consequently, becoming an
'employee' in this sense implies that the income, derived from such
employment, is tax free.  This has been tested in the courts
successfully on a number of occasions.
Several benefits have ensued from this: firstly, everyone has developed
an understanding of how to organize their own financial affairs to
minimize their tax burden; secondly, being self-employed means the 20%
tax rate can be largely reduced through business write-offs; thirdly,
negotiation of contracts, in such an atmosphere, has largely eliminated
the 'us and them' mentality between the corporation and the worker.  Now
it is just a lot of independent co-operating peer companies; fourthly,
because there are no 'bosses' as such, people have a lot more latitude
on how and where they perform their work.  This has led to an incredible
amount of home office and business de-centralization and flexibility.
Its not yet perfect by libertarian standards, but the direction has been
chosen towards a model of government limited to an arbitration function
and to provide a common foreign policy.
My belief is that the creation of a libertarian environment in the US,
is unlikely without much social disruption and bloodshed.  Similarly for
the EU.  A more productive course of action is for libertarian minded
folk, to relocate themselves to countries that are amenable to such
changes in direction (Max! where can we go? Argentina maybe?), and work
to effect the creation of a showcase example of how it can work in
practise.  With the examples of New Zealand and Argentina and the growth
in their stability and affluence, this would be a constructive means of
affirming your libertarian beliefs, without violating the principle of
not initiating force, fraud or coercion.

much interesting info deleted
What kind of constitution and bill of rights does New Zealand have?
Check� this
Do I have the right of gun ownership to protect myself or stop
tyrannical takeover?
That's very funny.� The US, the country that allows most gun ownership
(in the 1st world), is the most in need of that right to defend against
both illegal and legal criminals. So much for the value of the 2nd amendment.
To answer your question though, yes you have the right to buy a gun,
just as you have the right to buy a car (a far more lethal instrument in
general). You are held to account for what you do with it however (irrespective
of whether its a gun or car).� If you kill someone, then you are generally
arrested and tried for either murder or manslaughter. Manslaughter is the
usual charge if you shoot someone who was threatening to kill you. It all
depends on how successful they were in the attempt. Several cases of pissed
off people shooting neighbours who were merely harassing them, and getting
acquitted of any charges, exist.� Something like 10 murders a year
and climbing (fueled by the gangsta rap lovers amongst the maori, mostly.
Thank you USA!!). When most violent crime is of the form of being beaten
up in a bar, or surprizing a burglar and getting threatened with a club
or knife, responding with lethal force is considered not to be very sporting.
Hand guns are rare, but there are hand gun clubs.� Seems a lot
like a waste of energy to me, preparing for an event that is very unlikely
to occur in your lifetime.� Most gun owners are hunters, shooting
pig, deer, possums, elk .... Permits are not required. Bow hunting is also
quite popular.
New Zealand is a parliamentary democracy in the english tradition, with
only one house. Recently, MMP (similar to Germany's) system of representation,
was passed by referendum. This means that any candidate and/or party that
gets 5% of a popular vote, gets a seat in the parliament. The more 5%s
you get, the more seats.� Each citizen gets 2 votes.� One for
a candidate, and one for a party.� There are currently 6(ish) major
political parties.� Under MMP, proportional representation means that
the the elected candidates have to form a coalition government. I.e. they
all get together and make/break friendships until a clear winner/majority
is declared (a very public process). If a clear winner cannot be found,
another election is held until something gells. Once that happens, the
majority coalition designates a 'prime' minister and a cabinet of ministers,
to call the shots.� This is very unlike a presidential executive,
in that these ministers are, in effect, hired by the coalition government
and not directly elected to office.� Prime ministers do not have to
get impeached to remove them from office.� If the majority coalition
gets P.O'ed with any minister's track record, he gets fired.� If the
population gets P.O'ed with the winning coalition, the coalitions will
change to form a new government and new cabinet, to suit the mood(swing)
of the populace. This is a very adversarial system for a government to
operate under.� There are virtually no bi(multi-)partisan activities
(the last was the economic revolution in 1986).� Generally, the opposition
is always angling to destabilize the current majority coalition, with lots
of rhetoric flying in the press. Consequently, the majority coalition has
to keep on their toes and please the population.� Sometimes this leads
to some skullduggery and dishonest activities.� The population (and
press) have exactly zero tolerance for crooked politicians.� Typically,
a Member of Parliament who gets out of line, is out of office within the
month, often the week. Ergo, no real need for guns when you have a government
that can be dissolved at any time by either a new majority being formed,
or the population calling for an election.� Unpopular laws are generally
ignored, or become the cause for a new election. This happens on a regular
I always had a sneaking suspicion that basing the US republic on the
roman model, was not such a good idea.� Look what happened to them.�
(Hail Clinton!, long live the emperor! Only until the present emergency
lasts, honest! Those huns (drug dealers) and vandals (terrorists) have
to be defeated first).
Its hard to compare, how NZ's system works in practise, with the self-aggrandizing
and self-important poll-doll system in the US (bread and circuses).�
Mostly politicians in NZ are the guys who live next door, and who you go
fishing with.� They all have a distaste for overinflated egos.�
This is deeply ingrained in the national psyche, often to a fault (tall
poppy syndrome).� It is a nation of fiercely rugged individualism
(even at its collectivist height in the 1970s).� You are still considered
to be a wuss if you didn't build your own home, or don't fix your own car
or computer (or write your own crypto?), or have your own business, although
this is changing under the onslaught of US cultural imperialism and hamburger
diplomacy. As it's an island nation, 1 in 5 people has a boat, and generally
use it to go fishing.� Again, no permits necessary. A lot of people
also build their own boats, although this is changing ...� I suppose
the closest comparison in the US, would be to think of it as a cross between
Alaska and Hawaii.
Hope that answers your questions.� You should look around the NZ
web sites for more detail, or better yet, take a month or two and go and
check it out.� Christmas is fast approaching, which is the start of
summer and the holiday season, all rolled into one.

Simple,  they would work anarchically.  If the guy whose house is
burning down is an assh*le, then let it burn.
Somewhen in the last 50 odd years, equality of opportunity (to not be an
assh*le), got confused with egalitarianism (all people get the same treatment, assh*les included).
Anarchy is admitting that egalitarianism can never work without
promoting assh*lism.

@_subject: Question about anarchic systems and natural disasters (fwd) 
Tax supported fire brigades are a very recent invention, and are often
still privately run (at least in my neck of the woods).  In the above
circumstance (my [sic] Jim's house), one would have to weigh the
relative risks against the possible rewards.  If Jim is such an assh*le
to live next to, I might be more inclined to soak my own house in the
expectation that Jim will be hitting the road after his house has burned
Given that humans tend to go in for self-organization, there are likely
to be a multitude of societies that naturally form in an anarchy. Presumably they would be heavily ghettoized a-la Snow Crash, but there
will always be plenty of room for various stripes of
socialist/neo-fascists to form their own societies.  What they can't do
with impunity, is tell me that I am, ipso facto, a member of their
society.  Undoubtably they would be inclined to try, but in the absence
of a highly organized and militarized support group, in the form of the
'monopoly merchants', they will have a harder time of it.
Personally, I believe that states inevitably arise out of anarchic
assemblages of societies. Chalk it up to human frailty. Where anarchy is
beneficial, is in terminating obsolete state structures in order to
allow newer and (hopefully) more appropriate social structures to form. The current form in the US is rather pathetic.  A 'great society' that
has as its paramount goal the perpetuation of a 19th century
hierarchical model for human interaction. I would have said 18th
century, but Abe took care of the restructuring 130 years ago.
In the 19th century, the model for state formation was based upon
geographical limitations. The technologies of the day meant that the
territory you could force to knuckle under was severely constrained.
Starting from scratch today, it would make more sense to create
societies out of like minded individuals from wherever they live on the
planet (and off it?).  The phylums of the Diamond Age are, IMHO, a good
model for this.  This should give the socialists among us great cheer
and hope.  Rather than attempting to coerce all individuals within an
arbitrary geographical region to knuckle under and pay taxes. I would
suggest a good PR and proselytization campaign with the intention of
recruiting good tax-paying and benefit consuming suckers -- er ...
subscribers, wherever they may live.
Its not like this model hasn't been successful in the past, viz: the
Mormons, Scientologists, Roman Catholic Church, Marxism, the Moonies,
Amway, Herbal Life, and certain aspects of the music industry. Think of
it, rather than trying to disenfranchize 50 million north americans,
there exists already a highly indoctrinated group of people in China
(some 2 billion at last count) who would gladly subscribe to your brand
of socialism, even if just to get away from their current model. At the
very least, this would breathe new life back into Radio America. It
would also legitimize the need for US military troops stationed in 100+
locations around the world.  They could be seconded to the IRS to
enforce compliance.
On the other hand, maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe the use of
coercion and force *is* the raisson d'etre for the state.

The point being that Single side band transceivers are covered by a VHF
license, and don't count as ham/amateur although the spectrum overlaps.
Morse and other archaic codes are not required. Connectivity to telephonic
land stations is available.
In the mid-80's I purchased a yacht and sailed out over the horizon.  In
the preparation stages for this I investigated the comms availability and
ran head on into the old boys/popular mechanics of the '50's crowd, that
insisted I endure their hazing ceremony and learn Morse.  Suspecting that
adding morse parsing to the deep structures of my brain would turn me into
a popular mechanic, I declined. Other alternatives existed -- one SW
solution was to type in ascii which was then translated into morse before
sending (and vice versa).  Seems several other would be Cap'n Blighs, had
the same problem.  Hence marine electronic stores started stocking SSB
transceivers, which I purchased in the form of a ham transceiver with
factory installed disabling for the US. I disabled that strap pronto, and
was able to enjoy both listening to the cruising ham tag hunters, and make
telephone calls from 5000 miles out in the Pacific (12,000 when calling
Bay of Islands net in New Zealand). I had no problem using it to discuss
work and to ship data.  Whether I was breaking the Federal Communist
Channels rules or not, I can't say.  Of course, not being a United
Socialists citizen makes this easier.  Where I come from you get the
license/call numbers when you purchase the equipment.
And while I've got your attention, on another thread entirely re:
renewable energy sources -- where I come from we use geothermal and
hydroelectric (think hoover dam), to power the country. A lot of
individuals who have steady flowing water with a good head, on their
properties, also power themselves this way.  We also use LPG and CNG to
power about 50% of our autos. I would expect that using all that
relatively cheap electricity to produce metal hydrides would make hydrogen
powered vehicles viable as well.
The Union of Socialist Americans tends to not have much in the way of
raging rivers, so there have been discussions about harnessing the moon's
energy by building tidal hydro generators.  Last I heard, the
environmentalists thought it might hurt the fishies (more than fishing for
agricultural fertilizer?), so nuclear it is.  I suspect there's more to it
than that, nuclear probably has more dick-stroking factor.

SSB xceivers cost <$700. Try any marine electronics store.  Best choice
is a ham xceiver with strap selectable SSB (actually a violation of FCC
dictate to enable SSB on a ham rig, but everyone does it anyway). This
would cost ~$1500, the Icom 7658 is a good one I know of. Go and get
your local equivalent of a VHF license, send in the extension to cover
SSB (~$50).   Then purchase a 'PacRat' from any ham hangout. I got mine
in Redwood City CA, on El Camino real - some years back now though.
This is a little box that hooks into the back of the ham/SSB set and
into a serial port of your PC.  It comes with some basic packet handling
software.  Last time I looked, PacRats were <$200.  Don't expect any
great xfr rates however.  Noise to signal requires many packet
retransmissions as the ionosphere is not a very good mirror.  Running
TCP/IP over it should be easily doable.  Basic use is to dial in the
frequency yourself on the SSB (this usually requires an auto-tuner ~$700
AND a manual tuner ~$100, for best results).  You need to get the best
antenna you can afford.  Unfortunately, antennas are frequency range
specific, so you'll probably need 3: one for 0-5000 miles, 5000-12000,
12000-?.  Its easy to rig the tuner to support 2-3 antennas, switch
selectable.  You need a Good Earth for anything to happen as expected.
By now it should be possible to get some extra SW to drive the freq
selection, so you could do spread spectrum.  This is not allowed of
course, as you are expected to do the call-sign exchange protocol on
each freq session.  There are freqs that are dedicated to digital
(ship-to-shore commercial).  You may have to get a commercial license
for this though.  One nasty thing about radio is that you share the
spectrum with others, so collisions tend to make a hash out of
reliability.  Store and forward at unpopular times such as 3:00 EST,
could be a good alternative.  The longer distance freqs (>12000), are
the most uncluttered, but suffer from the most noise to signal.  A
bounce across the pacific to the house next door, would be potentially
more reliable than a lower freq. Most of the ham sets also support FM,
so it would also be possible to piggyback on the ricochet freqs for line
of sight use. Or for a real adrenaline rush, piggyback the mil freqs.
If you really want to give the hams fits,  write a noise to morse engine
(or better yet, some captured call signs repeated endlessly) and swamp
the channels, where the old popular mechanics guys discuss their antenna
envy, at random intervals. 9:00 in the Ozarks is a fine time.  Sit back
and wait for the black vans to drive up.

And of course we know that this list should be the exclusive province of

saying that in Japanese.ï¿½ BTW, get the culture for your cultural slurs
correct.ï¿½ The etymology of chop chop is Shanghai, late 19th century.ï¿½
A chop is an engraved ideogram representing a non-forgeable signature -
sort of a smartcard.ï¿½ Hence chop chop, translates as "sign on the
dotted line and get on with the deal". Taking this a little further, chopsticks
are so-called because they usually bear the 'chop' of the eating house
from whence you stole them.ï¿½ Needless to say, the chinese don't call
them that. This is akin to messages to you, being in spanish because your
neighbors to the south speak it.ï¿½ I suspect Nakatuji-san is entirely
'misty'fied by your random cultural references. Unless you haven't realized,
the internet actually exists outside of the Union of Shortsighted Assholes.ï¿½
Perhaps you'd be happier returning to your nakama on Assholes On-Line?ï¿½ï¿½

You generate a key pair on your machine (Netscape keygen tag or MS
CrappyApi.  The public key + other self-referential materiel is sent to
Thawte/Verisign et al (actually I like Thwart better).  This is via broken
PKCS for MS, or proprietary SPKAC for Netscape (ever wondered why there
are multiple buttons for your browser type?).  They then send you a
reference number via email. You cut and paste the number back onto their
site.  A PKCS mimetype is downloaded, causing your browser to grab and
stash your new cert. Netscape stores the key in its own special way, and the
cert in a PKCS format.  MS stores both in PKCS format, which is rather
easy to hack.
If I was to request a cert from Thawte (the only really useful global, free,
full strength one), and specify cyphers at punks.net (a well known interneting
list) as my email address, then the email would be available to all
subscribers of the list.  Certs being public, this is not a problem.  The
crucial part being that the private key I originally generated, matching the
public key in the cert, remains on my machine. I.e. I am the only one who
can decrypt stuff encrypted with the cert's public key.  This is an
interesting way of receiving encrypted mail (pseudo-)anonymously.  Expect to
see a rash of Thawte "collect your new cert" emails, followed by much
encrypted mail that only one list subscriber has the wherewithal to
decrypt.  Another alternative is to distribute the private key to selected
buddies on the list, to provide a shared cert.
Netscape specific: Migrating use of a cert requires an email to yourself
that you will receive on your new machine, after copying the key*.db files
and/or *.p12 files to the netscape/.../users dir, and importing it.
As to how sexdegrees.com could use this technology ... this would require
some degree of know-how which would probably preclude signing up in the
first place.

While the IRS may be a law unto themselves, congress has not passed any "tax
