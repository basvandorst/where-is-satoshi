   The NSA doesn't seem to want to play by the typical LEA best practices. So they might not be willing to send a formal request for data on a particular party (lest it be leaked or the target find out).
   My bet is real-time call interception for high-value targets.  If ye-random security researcher can crack most GSM encryption and listen in or inject fake content with cheap hardware, then the NSA certainly has people who can make that happen as well (and with billions of dollars to throw at the problem).

This talk is divided into two parts.  Morgan Marquis-Boire and Claudio Guarnieri talking about the militarization of the internet in part one, including both targeted and dragnet surveillance in deep-packet inspection.  (See also Citizen Labs' work on BlueCoat).  In part two, Jake Appelbaum talks about some of the most hardcore and cutting-edge NSA surveillance tactics and equipment.  (See also yesterday's Der Spiegel articles).
