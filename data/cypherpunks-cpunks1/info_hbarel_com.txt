I agree with what you say, especially regarding the frustration with TOR, but I am not sure it contradicts the message I tried to lay out in my post.
Secure browsing is one instance of anonymity applications, which, as I mentioned, is used. I completely agree that technology may not be mature enough for this other instance of anonymity applications, which is anonymous file sharing. My point was that there is a lot of anonymity-related technology that is not used, especially in the field of finance; I did not claim that there are technological solutions available for each and every anonymity problem out there. I apologize if this spirit was not communicated well.
It's not that we have everything - it's that we don't use most of what we do have, although we once spent a lot of efforts designing it.
