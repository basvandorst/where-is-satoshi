Good Day, my Friend!
Dear Stranger, I have decided to write to you because I am lonely.
Yes, I am a nice, good looking girl, I am young and smart. But still I
am lonely. Of course I get signs of attentions from men here, in my
country, but I still feel that I should look for somebody else.
If you also think that you need to find somebody. If you miss woman's
tenderness, care and attention, please let me know
