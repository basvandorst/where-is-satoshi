A neutron source is usually a light element with a high neutron/proton
ratio, coupled with an alpha emitter.  I believe the Nagasaki bomb used
beryllium-9.  An alpha particle impacting a beryllium nucleus will fuse
with it, forming carbon-12, and the binding energy will eject a neutron.
I think aluminum and a few other light elements will undergo similar
reactions to release neutrons in the presence of alpha particles.
Polonium is primarilly an alpha emitter.  It would work as part of a
neutron source, but it is not a particularily good choice because its
half-life is only 138.4 days (polonium-210).  This makes it expensive
to obtain, and impractical to store.

Zero.  If you stole all the money, there would be none left to pay you interest.

@_subject: How do I choose constants suitable for Diffe-Hellman? 
Yes, Phil Karn posted a list of such numbers to the list last May, and
the program used to generate them.  Since some people have expressed
their distaste for large files re-posted/forwarded to the list, I won't
send it, but you can get it from ftp cs.cmu.edu:

It answered my ping last night (finger remailer-list at chaos.bsu.edu)
finger remailer.help.all at chaos.bsu.edu

@_subject: How Did This Get Done? 
The same way the remailers insert "nobody" or "anonymous".
Read RFC 977...  (telnet port 119)
Whoever it is, I wish he would quit it, I've gotten several complaints
about someone flaming gays via my remailer in that group.

ftp cs.cmu.edu
cd /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/remailer
get ghio.cp-remailer.tar.gz
gunzip & untar
Change the following line in the readheaders.c,
in the block_addr function:
  if (match==1) address[0]=0;
  if (match!=1) address[0]=0;
Your blocked.addresses file is now a pass-addresses file.
Put the email addresses of other remailers in the file.
You now have a stealth remailer.
Now, EVERYONE should go do this RIGHT NOW!
No more excuses for not running remailers...  :)
