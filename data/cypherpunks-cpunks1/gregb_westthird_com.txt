Dave, for IP if you wish.
There's an interesting piece in the Riverside (CA) Press-Enterprise
[1] about
a woman who got her house toilet papered and decided to hunt down the
culprits. She didn't want to involve the police, reasoning that they had
better things to do, so she took the following steps:
* She canvassed local stores to see which one had a run on toilet paper.
* She then got the manager of the store to show her surveillance videos,
allowing her to see the personalized letterman's jacket of one of the
purchasers, as well as the license plate of the vehicle they got into.
* Finally, she used a high school yearbook (matched to the school
based on
the letterman's jacket) and online databases to get the names, phone
and addresses of all the teens spotted in the store tapes.
To me, this is a bit more than a "talker" feature. One takeaway,
IMHO, is
that we're pretty far down the road to sheepdom when average citizens
thinking "well, everything's monitored all the time anyway - let's
see if I
can make use of that."
Warm Regards,

First they came for the big ISPs
and I did not speak out
because I used a little ISP and ran my own server.
Then they came for the telcos
and I did not speak out
because I used VoIP.
Then they came to my little ISP
and I did not speak out
because I could still encrypt some traffic and control my own firewall.
Then they came for my router
and there was no one left
to securely ping back to me.
