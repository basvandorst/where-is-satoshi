David, use this link when sharing the Project Exile Condemnation Coalition's statement:
...so it doesn't wrap to a second line.
I am intrigued by the fact that NRA's Board of Coalition Builders has yet to respond to that statement; considering how many longtime dedicated leaders and proven patriots have signed it, one would think they'd have at least said "something."  I guess the fact that gun rights groups whose memberships collectively represent a large segment of their own membership aren't important.  Kinda reminds me of those who say we're wrong but have never taken direct exerpts and challenged them in a ready-for-publication article so they can be converted by KABAnators in private emails and then come back to us with gratitude for being patient with them while they were busy being By the way, Lao Tzu said, "Brevity is the root of all grace."
