@_subject: Cypherpunks Lobbying? (fwd) 
I posted this idea of mine about a month ago, when toad was having problems bouncing mail and the router on my own system was going crazy; I thought it had gone up but I got absolutely _no_ response about it, either pro or con, so I thought maybe I'd better repost it just in case it's still bouncing around sura or something.  I'll probably get flamed for starting up an old thread again, but this isn't so much an invitation for discussion as it is a call to action.  I've updated it, since some things have changed since then.

I'm glad you brought this up, Tim, because Pat Farrell, Carl Ellison, and
I have been discussing the possiblility of doing just that over the past
week or so.  The three of us, in addition to many others (we like to call
ourselves "The Mid-Atlantic Cypherpunks") are very near DC and thought we
might take advantage of this on behalf of others who don't have the luxury
of living near their legislators. Our idea (and it was originally limited to lobbying against the CDA, but
we can expand it now to lobby against that and S.974) was to have Cypherpunks
send letters (yes, authentic _snail mail_) to a Cypherpunk willing to go
deliver it in person, (namely me) and talk to whoever is there, be it the
congressperson or one of his/her aides.  The strategy of this action would
be to say,"hello, we represent  and we
oppose  and we feel this way
because  and
here is a letter from one of your constituents who feels the same way we
do."  A simple lobby. I thought this might be beneficial to cypherpunks because it seems that a
lot of representatives are difficult to get in touch with, since not all
of them have e-mail addresses.  I think there is a certain advantage in
this kind of action from an educational standpoint, considering that the
House doesn't seem to have a strong backer for this bill like the Senate
did, and the many Congresscritters who know nothing about the net only
need someone to explain the consequences of such a bill to them. Furthermore, to those ignorant of the net and its ways, a printed out list
of names and e-mail addresses collected through the web is completely
foreign and perhaps intimidating to them, and therefore not all that
helpful to us, IMHO.  Hand-signed letters (or hand-written, if your
printing is more legible than mine) in good, old-fashioned envelopes is
just what critters of this sort need to see. If any US citizens here would like me (and hopefully some older, wiser cypherpunks willing to join me on this trip) to deliver a letter to their congressperson please send a letter to this address:
                          The Hon. Whoever
                        c/o Kathleen M. Ellis
                           TSU box 898
                        Towson State University
                         8000 York Road
                          Towson, MD  21204
On the envelope you must include:
The letter must have:
If you need more information for your letter, good URLs on the subject are:
If you don't know who your representative is, try to find her/him through
and look for a familiar looking name from your state.  Unfortunately there's no "point-and-click" US map to refer to to find out which district is yours, but you should be able to find out fairly easily by looking for familiar names.  If you really get stuck, try your local League of Women Voters.
The main thing is, I need these letters soon.  In order to have a shot at
getting to talk to anyone, I must make appointments with the offices of
the respective representatives.  The house is expected to vote on this
topic any day now; the clock's a-ticking.  I ask that all letters be sent
so that I can recieve them by August 11, 1995.  I aim to raid congress on
Wednesday, August 16.  This date could be changed, depending on the definite
responses I get from people willing to help. I have lobbied before, and I'm up to the task, but it would be nice to
have some other politically-oriented cypherpunks along for, at the very
least, moral support.  Anybody interested, Please Please Please send me
some e-mail.  Carl or Pat might go, and if we get enough people to help we can split the workload among teams.
If anyone has comments/questions/suggestions, don't hesitate.  I'd
appreciate whatever isn't necesary to go up on the list to be sent to me
privately, so's I don't get into trouble for "inciting spam". -=Kathleen M. Ellis=-

@_subject: Pat Robertson Fears E-cash? 
I read in the New York Times that a lot of fundamentalist Christians fear the e-cash revolution because they believe that eventually everyone will be required to bear a tattooed bar code on their right hand which would contain all a person's information:  name, d.o.b., birthplace, etc.  Such a tattoo would also be used to deduct e-cash from a person's "account" when they made purchases.  It's still a bit of a stretch; they're using the book of Revelations to back up this theory.

@_subject: The real value of munition t-shirts (Re: CJR returned to sender) 
I've found that the real value of my shirt is the fact that it's  a valuable cypherpunk detector device for strangers who have come up to me and said,"Wow!  Is that the shirt I've heard so much about.. are you really a cypherpunk... hey there nice perl... " etc. etc. etc.  I've been approached about it at a Taco Bell, at the movies, and at a favorite coffee house of mine (several times, in fact).  One night I wore it to a dance club here in Baltimore, and no less than 6 people, all of whom I had never met before, approached me about it and wanted to talk about cypherpunk issues.  None of them were on the list.
Furthermore, it's an excellent conversation starter among friends and acquaintences who don't know anything about crypto or ITAR.  It's an easy
segue into a topic that really needs to be talked about, IMHO (and probably in your humble opinion, too).
To me, the price of the shirt is well worth the interesting discussions I've had with people I'd never talk to about crypto or at all otherwise.

@_subject: CYPHERPUNK considered harmful. 
I agree with Peter's point... some of the core cypherpunks (I'll not
mention names) can be somewhat elitist, whether they mean to or not.  Not
that they don't have some reason to be...as Pat Farrell once told me the
cypherpunks mailing list is, to some degree, an IQ filter.  Many
cypherpunks have a firm reason for some self-indulgent pride.  However,
our goal (or, at any rate, _a_ goal) is to make crypto use ubiquitous,
and for this we must deal with the public at large in a, perhaps, more
diplomatic and user-friendly manner. 8> True, but if the majority of active participants see an alternative
agreeable to them, they may just switch and start calling themselves
something else.  If the list owner likes it and changes the name of the list, then what of the cypherpunks unwilling to change?  It would appear, then, that they would be the ones who would have to find somewhere else to go.
Anybody who reads the mailing list or the cyphernomicon knows this, but anyone hearing the name for the first time does not get this impression.
Better than a vote (and more effective in western culture, where only 39% of the population votes anyway but just tends to go with the flow) is to propose an alternative, flat out, adopt it for yourself, and whoever prefers it will follow your lead.  If nobody likes it, then the cypherpunks are simply here to stay.
My point is that you may not have to do all this.  This is a recurring thread on the list. . . if enough people feel the same way you do you could have the human resources effective for a cypherpunks "take-over".
As for myself, I don't think I would change. . . I actually _am_ a "long-haired wierdo".  I think a slightly more conservatively named organization similar to the cypherpunks would be a good thing, however, simply because I like the idea of having something more low-key to compare c-punks with, sort of like the IRA to Sinn Fein.  I'm just offering some humble advice, knowing full well that I am for the most part an unknown lurker without much reputational weight to throw around.  It's also part of a leadership dynamic that is, I feel, underused.  (Furthermore, if it works, I could use it as a paper topic for my social psychology class ;). )

@_subject: My new perspective on ITAR (was Re: Munitions shirt (again) 
Funny, this thread sounds awfully familiar.  In fact, I think I wrote almost this _exact same post_ about 3 weeks ago, just substituting "Berkeley" for "Towson State University".  I mentioned the fact that I live in the International House of _my_ campus, and we discussed the legality of my wearing it.  We hashed over it for a few days, and never really came to a real answer, since ITAR is rather vague in that area.
I might add, however, that two days ago I wore my RSA shirt to my sound
design class, where the guy I happened to sit down next to recognized it,
was familiar with what it stood for, and knew all about the Zimmerman
case; not because he was a crypto enthusiast or a comp sci major, but
because he works for customs at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport. This event really changed my point of view considering ITAR... I figured that it was just one of those dumb laws that _nobody_ really paid much attention to except for the FBI and that was only because they were looking for a way to nail Zimmerman for writing good crypto.  I had assumed that ITAR was something that  customs agents/L. E. O's/etc. learned about, took a  test on it, then forgot about it the next day.
Interesting... they _really_ are serious, aren't they?

@_subject: CDA as a tool (was: Re: Helping the Crypto-Clueless) 
I agree:  and in addition to that, I'd like to say that contrary to the
beliefs of some people on this list, I don't think the CDA is
representative of a legislative body's spiteful action against general
free speech and information; it's far to simple a motivation for
computer-illiterate, re-election minded professional politicians.  They
simply don't know enough about the nature of the internet itself to
conspire to something as abstract as all that.  I believe that every
congress critter had a specific social enemy in mind when he/she voted for
that bill; somebody who they've been using as their banner, whom they vow
to fight against when re-elected. Pagans are a good example of a group likely to be the victims of such political action.  I, as an activist in the field, ask you to imagine the
consequenses for the gay civil rights movement, when even discussing the issue is viewed as 'indecent or immoral' by some of the more conservative lawmakers.  Remember when Canada banned the import of pornography, even the news-oriented gay and lesbian publications were halted at the border.  The crypto relevance in this post is the value of examples such as these when explaining to your friends why they need non-government-escrowed crypto so badly in electronic discourse.  People tend to see the need for it a bit more when they see the threat more clearly.  I'm a college student, and while not all my friends are involved in the same pursuits I am, most of them are at least loosely associated with groups which are considered undesireable by some government types (Black Activists, Jewish Activists, Pro Life/Choice advocates, etc).  In college, who isn't?
I don't post too often to cypherpunks, so if this view is overly simplistic, right on the mark, or completely wrong, send me some mail, and we'll discuss.

I'm re-forwarding you the second half of this article, because it seems clear that you didn't read the whole thing the first time.
I know you read at least this far, but keep reading...
Allow me to adjust your point to "Here's an example of what sendmail exploits can do".
