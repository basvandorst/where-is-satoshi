I still have not received any thing from you. So now I guess I have to take a another step. Bernice Reed

@_subject: STUFFING ENVELOPES 
THIS E-MAIL IS FOR ANDREW AEVORE ( PRESIDENT)?
I MAIL YOU A MONEY ORDER FOR $27.50  ON 1-2-2001 I'AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT STUFFING ENVELOPES. IF I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU SOON I'LL PUT A TRACE ON THE MONEY ORDER JUST IN CASE IT'S LOST.
                             THANK YOU.  BERNICE REED
