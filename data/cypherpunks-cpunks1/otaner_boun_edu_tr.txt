@_subject: Encryption ? 
I am a Mathematic student at Bosphorus University in Turkey.
I am interested in both computer applications and mathematical base of encryption.Where can I find this kind of staff on internet.
Is it necessary to have high level of mathematical background in order to deal with encryption??
By the way Is there any member of this list from Turkey?
