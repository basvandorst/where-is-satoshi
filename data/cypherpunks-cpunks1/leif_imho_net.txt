What about the difference in twins being that one can be from two ovum
and two sperm??  Did you ever think of that??  Thus a brother and sister
that are twins?  Maybe you are one of said twins two eggs two sperm...
Is if fraternal VS paternal twins?  I forget...
or maternal VS paternal??   Maybe paternal two sperms maternal the egg
split twice... High School Biology was so long ago and I do computers
now, not biology or medicine.

HUM SOunds like the idea of the 'auto record'  I say a keyword on the
phone and wham I am being recorded to see *IF* I am some sort of
terrorist trying to overthrow the government, get stuff that I should
not have like a fully functional missile and what not.  Do you all believe this?  I do. I can not say why but I do.
(Actually I could say why but it is two long stories.)
Do you believe this is done in phone calls in the US based on the
telephone switch doing the monitoring and it monitors ALL calls not just
those that go over seas???  I believe so...  See my above statement.
Have you been recorded before??? I believe I have....  WHY???  Well, if
you ask that then you do not belong on this group!

1983????  Are you 100% sure about that I am almost 100% sure that it was
alone longer than that.  I can not be quoted on it but I am sure that it
was in existence before that...  OH I beg your pardon, 1983 is what the government will really admit to even if there are documents that show it
may be older than that....
