@_subject: Remember me? 
Good day, my gentleman
Where are you, ready to understand the feelings, which overflow me, which are not afraid neither of strength of arms, nor of the bad eyesight?  Where are you?
I am alive today, I am ready to feel, I am ready to sing of happiness.  I am ready to cry to the skies about my happiness, about the ability, the wish to love and to be loved, I want to cry to the skies: Where are you, my I can’t wait till the sky will give me my angel who will point me the heart which loves me more than anything else in this world! And will tell me where you are! I am here  waiting only for You.
