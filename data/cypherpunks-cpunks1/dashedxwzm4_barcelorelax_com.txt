i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. it's definately worth the long drive,
interested? i think it would be so fun. and a delicious coke.
ok, i'm off to knit...
2. to keep the bedrooms clear i throw all the dirty laundry in the laundry room and shut the door. out of sight, out of mind! mostly i just stinking LOVE knitting. corned beef is cheap meat, a head of cabbage is less than 50 cents, and i bet you have all the ingredients for the bread in your cupboard. you should make this meal tonight!
they make me smile every day. and the fact that she's 31 makes me happy to be 31.
i am not going to worry...about a thing.
last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!
i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
i mean, look at her hair. wooohoooo!" i love her style. the best part of dinner was the irish soda bread- it was so so good, and it's really easy to make. happy happy days.
you've gotta love people with humor like that.
