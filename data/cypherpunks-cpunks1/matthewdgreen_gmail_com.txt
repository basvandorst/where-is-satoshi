@_subject: [cryptography] cryptanalysis of 923-bit ECC? 
I'm definitely /not/ an ECC expert, but this is a pairing-friendly curve, which means it's vulnerable to a type of attack where EC group elements can be mapped into a field (using a bilinear map), then attacked using an efficient field-based solver. (Coppersmith's).
NIST curves don't have this property. In fact, they're specifically chosen so that there's no efficiently-computable pairing.
Moreover, it seems that this particular pairing-friendly curve is particularly tractable. The attack they used has an estimated running time of 2^53 steps. While the 'steps' here aren't directly analogous to the operations you'd use to brute-force a symmetric cryptosystem, it gives a rough estimate of the symmetric-equivalent key size.
(Apologies to any real ECC experts whose work I've mangled hereb& :)
