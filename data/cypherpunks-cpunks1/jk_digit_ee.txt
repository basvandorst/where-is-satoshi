@_subject: brloop not working 
I just dont seem to get brloop working. It says:
Command failed -- brutessl missing ?
what seems to be wrong is that it tries to execute command:
brutessl -
although brutessl does not have a command line option '-'. Why is the '-' there after brutessl ?

@_subject: SSL CHALLENGE: ALERT! probable misallocation of keys? 
Just a dumb question: when brutessl-brclient-brloop will find the key, will it report it to the keyserver right away? What I mean is can I just start the brloops on my machines and log out, and not have to look at the display all the time?
BTW how can I log brloop's output into a file and not to the screen?

@_subject: Apache-SSL for export 
Are the SSL patches for Apache available somewhere else than in USA or UK?
You know I am a big security risk for those countries as I live in Estonia, so it is not allowed for me to get apache-ssl legally. Good old COCOM restrictions, the poor guys in Great Britain have not heard the world has changed.
So can anyone suggest how to get the software? Ftp, fsp, http, e-mail, anything will do.

What about Estonia :) The taxes are low, there are a very few government regulations, the currency is very stable (based on German mark) ... One interesting law in Estonia is that the state budget must be balanced, so there is no way for the government to spend more money than it really has.
Technological level here is also quite good, and Internet is more popular
than in any other Eastern Europe or ex-USSR country. I think Estonia is an ideal place for such projects: high-tech companies testing their new technological ideas, inventions and business assumptions in real-life conditions. Just get yourself here !

What about cellular phones, especially GSM? As I have heard GSM is supposed to be secure, at least thats what the salespersons tell every time they are selling a GSM.
I know ciphering algorithms A3, A8 and A5 are used in GSM phones, but I know nothing more about them.

Another way to see the dialog boxes is to delete one of the CA's that came with Netscape Navigator and then connect to for example What software there is available (preferably non-commercial) to become a CA? Is for example the SSLeay package enough?

@_subject: Netscape hole without .Xauthority (fwd) 
Haven't seen this on the cypherpunks yet, sorry if this has been here already. o                             tel: +372 6308994            o>
  netscape -noraise -remote "saveAs(.rhosts)"
  netscape -noraise -remote back
In the second command, the path should be specified whenever possible (~ is not accepted).
If the target user does not already have a .rhosts and is not looking at that
precise moment, then the chances are it worked !
Solution to the problem : every user concerned should either create a Xauthority file, or stop using Netscape.
PS: WHY do they bother with PGP and RSA security when they keep such holes ????

@_subject: Bank transactions on Internet 
Suddenly some banks here in Estonia have decided that they must start
offering banking services over Internet already during the next months.
What worries me is that some of them are talking about using 40-bit SSL as
the main security mechanism.
What about banks in US and Europe, how many of them are using Internet and
WWW to offer their services already? Is it possible to use WWW forms to
make real transactions or can you just view your transaction history and
account status? In case the banks are using WWW forms and SSL, are the
services limited to 128-bit clients?
How is the client authentication handled? Does the client just get a plain
username and password?
I had a look at some banks like Security First National Bank and some
others, and it seems that they use just SSL + username/password for they
banking services. Does this really work, especially with 40-bit keys?
SSL with client certificates would seem a little bit more secure once it
is available, but still not secure enough for real banking on Internet.
Just curious (and confused),

@_subject: Bank transactions on Internet 
What is the use of 128-bit server, as there are still no 128-bit WWW
clients freely available in Europe? (Workhorse has 128-bit SSL, but the
client is still far from perfect).
Of course I believe that SSL server with source code available is still
much more secure, as your own consultants can have a look at the code,
that's why I personally would rate Apache-SSL higher than commercial
applications like Thawte consulting Sioux.

As far as I understand anyone can fairly easy crack the 40-bit SSL your
bank is using, and you must be lucky nobody has done it yet with your
account. Still it seems odd that banks are telling their customers about
secure communications without having any real security.

This AT&T Orca or FPGA chip or whatever the name is, is it freely
available device and how easy would it be to get one? I am not sure I
understand what it is, but even in case you would have to write the code
to crack RC4 and program the chip yourself, that does not seem very hard
thing to do. What I am asking is if this cracking device would be
available to anyone with 400$ and some computer knowledge?

@_subject: Bank information protected by 40-bit encryption.... 
Are there any banks besides SFNB then that use weak 40-bit encryption for
anything more than balance queries or transaction history, and allow to
make real transactions on-line?
I know Merita in Finland allows bank transactions using 40-bit RC4, but
they also use one-time passwords (every user gets a printed list with 40
or so password pairs, each of which you can use just once).

@_subject: RC4 on FPGAs (Was: Bank transactions on Internet) 
Once someone gets this kind of cracking device ready, I think it would be
nice to make the information freely available, or start selling these for
nominal price.
This would also make an interesting device connected to Internet. In case
of fast device people could use it either for free or pay using ecash for
using it, and crack their SSL sessions. May be Netscape or Microsoft or
someone else (may be even Community Connexion :) lobbying the government
for allowing export of strong encryption could sponsor it. It should not
be so expencive. Much more useful than amazing fish-cam or coke machine on

@_subject: JavaScript to grab email 
Another annoying feature in JavaScript and Netscape. Have a look at The page uses JavaScript to steal your e-mail address and sends a test e-mail message to the address it grabbed. It works with Netscape, which is probably only browser supporting JavaScript.
Probably there will soon be thousands of pages which include this code, and people using Netscape 2.0 will be spammed with commercial messages. So just put some false e-mail address in your Netscape browser to disable this feature.
The script was developed and announced by Glenn Fleishman, moderator of the Internet Marketing mailing list. Thanks for letting people know.

@_subject: Starting an e-cash bank 
I think this idea of a new e-cash bank or other kind of financial institution sounds very good. I have been thinking of the same thing here in Estonia, to set up a financial institution issuing e-cash for people here, but I think this would not in any way be an easy task. I am not very familiar with local legislation about financial and credit institutions, but I know that at least for banks the minimum equity capital or what you call it must be 50 million Estonian kroons (4 million US dollars). But I still think that for issuing e-cash and opening e-cash accounts you might not need to have such kind of capital. What does it take to be called a bank?
And how easy is it to start a bank in some caribbean country or similar tax haven? What are the minimum requirements?

GSM A5 security is supposed to have effective key length of 40 bits, although according to some sources 64-bit session key is used. The algorithms are not freely available, so you never know.
I would say GSM security is still better than nothing. The problem is of course that only tha radio link is encrypted, not the connection out into public telephone network.
