@_subject: Security through obscurity 
I agree with this 100%.
The interesting fact is, a lot of commercial programs rely on security
through obscurity. Often, anyone who takes the time to disassemble
the interesting routines, can crack the encryption.
Yes it is stupid. But, a lot of people and companies rely on "security through obscurity" to protect their applications/data. Part of this is due to export restrictions, but a large part is just
due to lack of awareness.
One of my favorite applications has embedded in its license
"...nor shall the Licensee attempt to decrypt
any Passwords that may enable the Software's functionality..."
This is not a substitute for real security.
