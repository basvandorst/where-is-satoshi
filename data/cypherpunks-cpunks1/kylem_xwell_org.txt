@_subject: Twitter details on 2FA 
I kinda dig the level of detail in Twitter's blog post today on their
new 2FA system. Not really qualified to analyze said details, but
certainly they're not going for the obscurity approach.

Or that different departments / teams have different enforcement
priorities, or that they don't cooperate well with each other...

@_subject: Google threat analysis selectively applied 
IIRC Google happened to run across it, and they spend a lot of time
(and money) trying to detect bad ads, but it's certainly not
foolproof. The arms race continues. There are many areas where we
can't really consider Google one of the "good guys" (insofar as that
label means anything), but fighting malware is an area where they
certainly seem to be on the side of good.

Anyone more qualified than me (read: nearly everyone on this list)
wish to comment on this analysis of a crypto-related vulnerability
disclosure in LastPass?

@_subject: Google to encrypt cloud storage 
Keep in mind that not all law enforcement (or the broader class of
potential adversaries) will have access to NSA/FBI-type capabilities
or even NSLs and such, not to mention that it provides additional
protection in case a Google server is breached. Having spent time
chatting with some of their security people, including members of
their incident response team, I'm not so cynical that they view
anything like this as a reason not to secure their stuff. I find it
far more likely that they see this as adding an additional hurdle for
adversaries to clear.

Honestly, this happens a lot already to varying degrees, and if early
reports about NSA retention rates dropping and personnel churn
increasing can be believed, then perhaps this will happen more.
