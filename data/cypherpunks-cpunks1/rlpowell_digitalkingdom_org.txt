@_subject: So, NFS _replacement_ for linux/solaris? 
Any suggestions for a file system that can:
1)  Run on Linux.
2)  Be mounted on Solaris (this takes smb out) and Linux (this takes
SecureRPC out).
3)  Have some at least somewhat secure user authentication.
Any help very much appreciated!
I've seen Coda, but I don't know if it's Solaris code is ready for prime
