[quoting q quote of Karl Denninger:]
My employer experienced this problem -- I thought it was related to the
cashe clearing problem in 4.9.4 on some platforms and upgraded to 4.9.4P1
(FreeBSD 2.1.0) -- which appears to have solved the problem for us. Not sure if it -really- fixes the problem or if we've been lucky since.

Um, er, I think, though I am not sure, that the issue in question is
either a hypothetical (judging from the article disclaimer), or that if
not, it just about ought to be.  It is the precise set of facts to lean
for the opinion that program code is meaningful speech or activity due
the full protection of the First Amendment.  I.e., a case with these facts

GAH.  Sorry about that truncated comment -- Morning misfire - went to
postpone to look up cites and sent instead.  Grumble finger macros,
grumble. The upshot being that a hostile work environment/harassment case with
these facts would serve as a great 'tie breaker' in any Supreme Court
decision between the "code is not speech" and "code is speech" split we're
seeing between federal jurisdictions. That is to say, in the American jurisprudence system, if you want
something protected from prior restraint as speech, you also have to take
the responsibilities the system imposes on you for the effects of that
speech.       -M
