Mr. May:
not usually kept by the individual (or when they are, they are often kept by both the health care provider *and* the individual). Now, it I haven't thought this through all the way (and I'm not exactly a world class thinker) but I can see several possible "products" that might be marketable in a "privacy aware" marketplace:
or TTP's key are necessary to read a medical record, but where only the hospitals key is necessary to write to the record. This would provide more privacy for Alice (or at least a combination of privacy and access logging) than exists under the current completely un-encrypted, accessible by almost anyone system that exists today.
with a strong access logging system, or have a setup (If possible) were the Either Alice's or the TTP's key will decrypt/allow access for cases when you need access to Alice's information when she is unable to provide it (severe trauma or medical condition, dead, in an adversarial legal battle etc.).
to her/wrong with her, but also the HCP's record of what they did.
information through a print-screen or other ways. Total and complete security is a really tough nut. The goal may simply be to make it harder to leak information, or provide strong accountability to that would have been trivial for me to look up anyone on the hospital computer system and order their chart, and return it with a "Oops, ordered the wrong number")
the hospital I used to work in, where a specific HCP within that system must cooperate with Alice to get *specifically* which parts of a record they need. By way of example, at a less monogamous point in my life, I was worried that I had contracted an STD (turns out I was wrong), and wanted to get it taken care of. The hospital where I worked (and had insurance) was not an option because they had one medical record on each patient, and, well, my mother worked there as a nurse in a department where I was being seen (occasionally) for a completely different problem. I wound up going somewhere else and paying out of pocket for the consultation. If there was the ability within the record keeping system for selective exposure of information, that could be handy.

the press releases.

insists you present ID. Now, if that order were encrypted so that only you, *or* a TTP could reveal *who* picked up order # 3247834 for 60 tablets of vicodan, then you have, if not more privacy, at least a trail of accountability to who leaked it.
"spaces" is that it's not only Alice and the Companies desires, but also the Feds desires.

this, and I am sure that this will open up *new* methods of fraud, but I don't claim to be able to prevent that.
more "expensive" to cheat the system than it is to go along with it, so the first step is to make registration require a little more you need to re-register after every election.
exception of those not *physically* present in the state for more than 5 consecutive business days during the registration period. For those people, they may request an "absentee registration request card", which they fill out, have notarized (the notary is simply notarizing that the card is filled out, not that the person filling out the card did so accurately).
feasible (this part I haven't worked out yet) one must show "proof of citizenship". It's tough, because we don't yet have "papers", and I don't really advocate mandating "papers". In fact I strongly disagree with papers.
some sort of proof of paying income tax, or at least filing for income tax, on the theory that anyone who pays into the system ought to have a say in it. I don't necessarily disagree with that.
to the individual. They are informed (in writing) that in order to vote they *must* present this card. This card contains a mag strip with a unique number (that is not linked to the individual), and a bar code that is the encrypted version of that number done with a the public half of a key (to prevent forgery). That key changes from election to election.
name. This is not to be tied to the number on the card, but just to account for every card.
scanner. These  are used to check that each card is "proper" by checking that the number on the back is encrypted with the proper key. (this way the private key isn't released until *very* shortly before the election).
that when you punch a whole, it records vote electronically, as well as providing a swipe card reader. When you are finished voting, it prints the ballot with your choices for each office in an OCR font, and a bar code with a hash of votes at the bottom (using a different large random number). The machine then wipes everything *but* the hash, and this new number. (this completely disconnects the voter from the ballot).
and then presses a "I'm done" button. This checks in the voter number and the hash, and the new random number, (stores it either on board, or on a machine on a "lan" (wire the polling place) the machine on the lan can be made fairly fault tolerant) (the voter number is to check for "double spending", the hash is a checksum for validation, the random number is for later verification). The "I'm done" also prints out a second card identical to the first. One is for the individual, should they wish to keep it, to later validate that their vote was counted properly. The other (since they are identical) goes into a sleeve (to prevent prying eyes) and into the ballot box.
button, and start back from the top. Repeat as necessary until (the machine storing the hashes and numbers) are taken to the collection point, where the hashes & random numbers are uploaded (at this point I think the voter number will no longer be needed), and the as each ballot is counted, it is marked off against the hash it matches. Then this list is made public (the list of hashes and random numbers). Each voter can then (if they care to) check their random number (either on line, or in a trip down to the local polling place).
since each ballot is human readable, and printed twice if one side gets screwed up, the other should still be useful. If that fails, then a human *should* be able to read as much of it as possible. Failing that, it simply gets listed as "unreadable", and if they voter checks, they can come down with their original ballot and present it for the count.
much of this could be done using a simple PC/Macintosh program, so Military bases could easily accommodate their soldiers & sailors. (Well, the marines and the flyboys as well).
place, as well as for people to be able to challenge the vote--if they can show that their vote wasn't properly counted (provable by presentation of a ballot) then things are rechecked.
code, they can still be machine read *AS WELL AS* easily verified by hand. The voting process remains (absent the registration process) almost identical to the current one. There is no use of cryptographic protocols to *protect* the voting, only to check for fraud and provide strong accounting.
away with, and eliminate much of what I have seen and heard about in the way of fraud--the "stiff wire" used to create invalid ballots, the dumping of large numbers of ballots in the trash, the "lost" ballot boxes, etc.
card has to be signed for each election.

The easy solution to this is to put up a web page with information *about* the NAMBLA site, and instructions on how to request that the site be delivered anonymously--as a gzip, zip, or stuffit archive.
If one has access to a web server that allows cgi, this is fairly trivial to do with two way anonymity.
Another solution would be to create a newsgroup like alt.websites.censored.binary and post the archive there every two or three days, and just link that from the web site.
While I am not willing to take the heat for posting the NAMBLA site on my server (for fear of getting my connectivity yanked) I am willing to assist in working out a system where this information can be made available to those who wish it without having to deal with the public scrutiny.

robust and reliable.
important thing is ergonomics. I've owned a Beretta 92, a Tanfoglio (eaa witness) .45, and a HK P7. I've fired glocks, Sigs, Browning Hi-powers (and clones/redesigns) and a wide variety of 1911s.
they don't feel "right", while the browning Hi-power, the HK P7, Beretta etc. all felt good. The P7 being the best IMO.
reliable as long as you don't make too many modifications to it.
worth talking about.
ways to achieve good accuracy, one is to be born with a natural talent. The other is to practice practice, practice. With 9mm being significantly cheaper than .40, you can practice a lot more for the same effectiveness of the .45 against them either.

In fact if you look at the slide on a CZ100, there is an odd "dongle" or lump between the rear sight and the ejection port. Rumor has it that this dongle is intended to be used to engage the slide on the pistol belt to rack the first round into the chamber enabling a patrol officer to bring his pistol into action single handed (apparently many European officers also tend to work with police dogs, and having one hand on the leash means it can't be used to rack the slide).

say--stroking a a pump shotgun, or racking the slide--along the lines of, say, opening a safe or gun locker?
Usually it's noises they are making (I would assume). Have you ever listened to your house at night? Every place I've lived there are all sorts of mechanical noises off and on all night long. Refrigerator coming on, heating (or cooling) units kicking on and off, creaking from the wind blowing, the tick of a clock, the whirr of computers running (well, in my home). The subtle click of the cocker engaging will (a) be lost in the other noises and (b) is innocuous enough that they probably won't. If it was something I worried about (I don't keep a loaded firearm in the house for home protection at this point, I'm not high enough profile for the Feebs or the BATF to want to raid my "compound", nor am I a sufficient irritant to the local Gestapo, and my neighborhood is relative free of home burglary/home invasion type crimes that I feel it is better to keep the guns in a locker than on my bedside table) I would simply put the gun under a pillow to muffle the noise further, engage the cocker and start hunting.
render irrelevant the click, you can wait until you're bringing the pistol online for firing to cock it (squeeze the cocker as part of the final presentation), or as Black Uni noted, one can squeeze the trigger first, then engage the cocker (although this would take a bit of  >The squeeze cocker is a solution for a non-existent problem.

 feature I like in that firearm. My reasons for choosing the firearm, from most important to the utterly trivial and pretty silly are:
me (this is a function of ergonomics, and will vary for different reducing muzzle flip and allowing for *much* faster followup shots.
factory mags are very sturdy and take a lot of abuse).
comfortable conceal carry piece, if I ever wind up doing so.
release than a frame or slide mounted release.  Yes, that lever serves multiple functions, it cocks the weapon and serves as a slide release, you don't have to move your hand, change your grip on the weapon, or use your other hand to release the slide, just get a grip.
booooring. (yes, I said utterly trivial and pretty silly).
little research and time I could come up with some minor nits about it to blow up all out of proportion to the weapons utility and ablities.

while they're sleeping or away, I expect you've gotten used to many of these sounds. Or you're oblivious to them.
for self defense--well, at least three, but three general cases is all I can think of off the top of my head:
incidence of B&E/Home Invasion, and one is afraid that their home will be hit. While this is a *very* good reason to have a loaded firearm close at hand, quite frankly there is a higher chance that the home will be burgled while you are away. Smart thing to do is move to a less dangerous neighborhood.
can use force with little or no repercussion, be that government or any other gang of thugs, and one wants to "go down fighting".  (lets' face it, no matter how good you are, no matter how fast and accurate, you aren't going to win a firefight with the kind and number of troops the government, be it city, state, or federal is going to throw at you, all you can hope to do is repel the first attack, and take more of them than there are of you). In this case, there isn't a lot you can do.
something to piss off the kind of person who will crawl in your window one night and slit your throat. Lock and load--there is nothing else you can do.
