I've just uploaded version 1.0.0 of the Python Cryptography Toolkit, a
collection of cryptographic routines for the Python programming language.
It's at ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/pct/pycrypt100.tgz.  All my code is public
domain; some of the algorithm implementations are GPLed.
as DES, IDEA, MD5, etc.  I will fix bugs in the software, and may add
or remove the odd module if some startling new research result comes
out, but things should be pretty stable from now on.
Hash functions: Haval, MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA.
Private-key encryption: Public-key: Digital Signature Standard, ElGamal, RSA.  (There's a
 for more information, the source code, and
binaries.  It includes arbitrary-sized integers, so the public-key
algorithms are implemented in pure Python; this entails a speed
penalty, but makes the code more valuable for educational purposes.

is at my workplace, and my employer doesn't run an anonymous FTP site.  I
also don't have an account with a local ISP, just because I haven't bothered
to get one yet.  Once I do, I'll certainly make the code available there.
found out about MS's protocol a few weeks ago.  Hmmm... Python Cryptography
_Package_?  Kit?  Collection?  Stuff?
