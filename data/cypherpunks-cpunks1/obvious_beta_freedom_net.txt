You're saying that the customer comes to the porn merchant with a
blinded credential.  The merchant goes to the authenticator with the
credential, and pays for it to be authenticated.  The blinding is there
to protect the customer, as the credential is unlinkable to his credit
card which he used to prove his age.
Actually there is direct sales contact with the content vendor.
The notion that he is going to come to the authenticator and pay CASH for
EVERY customer contact is absurd.  It's completely uneconomical until we
have a worldwide ecash infrastructure.  If that's what you had in mind,
shut up for ten years and speak up when you have something relevant
to say.
What will really happen is that the porn merchant will have an account
with the authenticator, and he'll pay every month or so based on how
many authentications have been done.  That's how business works.
This means that there IS sales contact, and the authenticator DOES KNOW
who his merchants are.  It is exactly the same business relationship as
exists today, except that the customers have the benefit of blinding to
protect their identities.
Somehow I doubt that the Reedys are going to get away with saying that
governments aren't held liable for misdeeds commited with their currency,
so they shouldn't be blamed when someone sells bad stuff using the
Reedy's own services.
Look at what they're accused of!  Providing access to kiddie porn by
verifying credit cards and assigning passwords.  That's exactly what
your bearer cert business will do except instead of passwords they'll
issue blinded tokens.
This is especially true when the de facto market for such a business
is only the worst porn, the porn that the customers really don't want
anyone to be able to find out they were involved with.  This kind of
information comes out in court.  You can't hide it.

Are you kidding?  These people just did the credit card verifications.
They'd be in just as much trouble if they provided bearer credential
In fact if anything this kind of prosecution is an argument *against*
getting into the ecash/ecredential business, especially if it is focused
on porn as some have proposed.  All you need is for someone to use it
to sell or authorize access to kiddie porn, and you're going to jail.

The point is, RAH claimed that selling adult verification services using
bearer credentials would be safe because, get this, the porn merchants
would pay the verification service using anonymous ecash!
First, there is no ecash and so this isn't a reasonable first step
towards getting bearer credentials established and in use.
Second, the supposed safety and blindness to the evilness of the business
partners is solely due to the ecash.  The verification service could
use simple credit card numbers and passwords exactly as is done today,
and still get all the benefits of deniability with regard to knowledge of
the evil wares being sold.  It is the ecash which provides the blindness
on that side.  Blinding the customers doesn't help at all in that regard.
So RAH was doubly wrong to imply that bearer credentials would have helped
out in this case where an age verification service is being prosecuted
because one of their clients is selling kiddy porn.
And if you can think outside the cypherpunk box for a minute, maybe
this will shed a little light on why the MTB didn't get into bed with
pornographers.  If RAH thinks he can con people into building a business
on this model he better think again.

This points to one of the big wins of XML over HTML.  Parsers are not
allowed to guess at the meaning of invalid XML with unbalanced tags and
such.  Today we have the problem that people create bad HTML but don't
know it because it looks OK on their browser, which overlooks some errors.
Then it fails on someone else's browser.  With XML there is a standard
about what works and what doesn't, and so you know that if your parser
can read it, everyone else's can too.
XHTML is the XML-ized version of HTML.  It's mostly compatible with
HTML but inherits the strict grammar from XML.
