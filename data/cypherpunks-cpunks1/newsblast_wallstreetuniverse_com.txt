@_subject: Featured Stock Of The Week - Cetalon Corp.!!! 
NOVEMBER 5, 2001 - THE WALLSTREET UNIVERSE REPORT
Dear Investor,
We would like to invite you to look at Cetalon Corp.  (CETA : OTCBB)  Cetalon is a great investment opportunity in the natural vitamins, minerals, and supplements industry.  The
company has a unique relationship with Sears (S), which allows
the company to operate within Sears retail stores and enjoy
unique locations on Sears' mainstream sales floors.  A small
float of approx. 1 million shares will surely drive demand for
the company's stock.  Read below for the complete profile.
+>+>+>  FINANCIAL DATA:
- Shares Outstanding: 5,500,000
- Float (Est): 1,000,000
- 52 week High: $5.00
- 52 week Low: $0.85
- Company Homepage   - Friday's Closing Price  $1.48  per share
+>+>+>  ABOUT CETALON CORPORATION - (CETA : OTCBB)
Cetalon is a "Store within a store" retail and direct marketing
company specializing in the sale of natural vitamins, minerals,
and supplements as well as health information technologies and
home health care products.  Cetalon is licensed to operate within
Sears retail stores and enjoy unique locations on Sears'
mainstream sales floors - which is a first for Sears which
normally places licensees around the perimeter of their stores,
or in separate locations/buildings entirely.  Cetalon operates in
46 Canadian locations in Sears retail stores and have recently
opened in 10 California stores under the name Sears Health and
Nutrition Centers - five shops are in Southern California and
five shops are in Northern California.   These will act as
prototypes for the Sears U.S. market. Cetalon's business model forecasts a rapid expansion into
department stores in the US with products from leading
manufacturers plus a full line of specialty formulated products
to sell under the Company's private brand. The best-trained and
motivated specialists in the industry will provide superior
customer service through our partner retailers full line stores,
taking advantage of their advertising and logistical support. The Company also has an alliance with Innovative Botanical
Solutions, a company with a global reputation for innovative
products and superior quality, to supply its private label brand.
These factors coupled with Sears' 63 million strong consumer
base, with a target market of nearly 50% represented, should
bring Sears Health and Nutrition Centers to profitability within
a relatively rapid timeframe, as per the following: +>+>+>  COST FOCUS
* Sears Health & Nutrition Centers has been appointed as the sole
Health & Fitness licensee of Sears,  Canada & U.S.A. * Sears Corporation will fund all build-outs on behalf   of Sears
Health & Nutrition Centers * Sears is contracted to sweep each register and close out the
daily books of Sears Health & Nutrition Centers. Sears handles
all aspects of collection,  cash security, credit card processing
and accounting control * Sears Health & Nutrition Centers will benefit from low fixed
operating expenses, with no fixed minimum.  This includes
electricity and all utilities.  Also corporate support such as
(volume discounts,  telephone, postage, advertising expenses) can be leveraged to reduce expenses +>+>+>  SUMMARY
With Sears' 63 million strong customer base and a booming health
and nutrition market - look for Cetalon to add stores and
increase sales, revenue and shareholder value.  This is a company
on the move! Wallstreet Universe is an independent electronic publication

Hello All  Investors,
Stocks soared Tuesday after the Fed targeted the weakening
economy with an aggressive half-percentage point cut in interest
rates. Techs led the charge, highlighted by a 17-percent surge in
shares of Hewlett-Packard as its merger with Compaq was dealt a
major blow. The rate cut was the central bank's tenth this year, and it took
the overnight fed funds rate down to 2 percent from 6.5 percent
at the start of the year. The Fed also lowered the discount rate
by 1/2 percentage point, taking it to 1.50 percent. Moreover, the
Fed suggested that more rate cuts are in the offing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average piled on 150 points, or 1.6
percent, to 9,591. Sustaining the Dow were shares of
Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan Chase, Alcoa,
Caterpillar, Home Depot and United Technologies. Ending in the
minus column were shares of Walt Disney, General Motors, 3M and
SBC Communications.
The Nasdaq Composite surged 41 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,835
while the Nasdaq 100 Index soared 42 points, or 2.9 percent, to
1,523.  In the broad market, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
sprinted 1.5 percent while the Russell 2000 Index of
small-capitalization stocks swelled 1.2 percent.
TALK ABOUT FAMILY SQUABBLES...  Hewlett-Packard powered the Dow,
with its shares surging 17 percent following news that the
Hewlett family would vote against the proposed H-P and Compaq
merger, which was announced in early September.  The family has a
stake of about 5 percent in the Dow stock. H-P has yet to say
when it plans to put the proposal to a shareholder vote. Compaq
fell 5.3 percent. +>+>+>  PLEASE READ - EIGHT REASONS TO LOVE SMALL CAP STOCKS

Hello All  Investors,
On Sunday night we will be sending out a new stock profile.  Our
last few profiles have performed with increased volume and nice
gains!!!  We look for this new stock to have an explosive next
week.  Keep your eyes open and Have a Great Weekend!!!
+>+>+>  AND COMMING UP...  Next week will be moderately busy in
terms of economic reports.  On Wednesday  weÂll get the October
Retail Sales report, which is most likely to show growth over the
month of September thanks to record-setting auto sales as well as
to discount shopping.  Also a number of readings on the
manufacturing industry will be issued including the Philadelphia
Fed survey, Business Inventories and  Industrial Production. Those reports for the most part are not expected to reveal
anything encouraging.  Finally, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is
due out next Friday, and like todayÂs PPI numbers it is expected
to indicate that inflation remains under control.  Although the corporate earnings season was over in October, a
bulk of key tech companies will report their results next week. Among them are Dell Computer, Hewlett Packard &  Applied
Materials.   Besides earnings and economic reports, developments
on the Afghanistan front will undoubtedly remain on everyoneÂs
radar screen and any further military progress over the weekend
could be an important catalyst for this market.

 MARKET ANALYSIS & SUMMARY
In a recent Louis RukeyserÂs Wall $treet Week news article, he
writes about three pivotal industries that lie squarely in the
path of tens of millions of increasingly affluent customers. The
next wave of leading industries and players will be healthcare,
financial-services, and technology stocks... companies emerging
as the new PfizerÂs, Merrill Lynches, and MicrosoftÂs of the
world. He went on to say: Financial services have come a long way
since the days of the haughty loan officer, arrogant stockbrokers
and dour bankers in pinstriped suits. Years of economic growth,
and unprecedented bull market and democratization of all aspects
of finance have reversed Wall StreetÂs traditional balance of
power. For the first time in history, banks, insurance companies and
brokerages are merging into one-stop financial shops. It is the
intent of the management team of EMB to capitalize on the present
market conditions surrounding financial-services, using new
technology, and with these changes hopefully the company could
show increased revenues and profits for the benefit of the
shareholders, which is priority number one for the new
management of EMB Corp.. Wallstreet Universe is an independent electronic publication

the current telephone line (dial-up) alternative. As the purchase of networks by foreign companies is not
permitted, China Broadband forms co-operative joint ventures with
government owned network companies, which have the sole right to
offer Internet access and value-added services. Under these joint
ventures, the Chinese partner contributes the exclusive access to
the network, while China Broadband contributes the required
capital, management and Internet technology to enable Internet
access once all government approvals have been received. The capital China Broadband contributes is limited to the
hardware to enable Internet access. As a result the Company
obtains exclusive access while avoiding the sizeable network
installation and maintenance costs. China Broadband enjoys
favorable terms under these joint ventures, including 60 to 80
percent profit sharing, board control and a 15 to 20 year
term.  The resulting footprint of cable television subscribers
the Company has under agreement is in excess of 14 million,
representing approximately 15 percent of ChinaÂs 90 million cable
subscribers; the largest cable market in the world (65 million in
North America). Given this large exclusive footprint and the
rapidly increasing demand for Internet in China (400 percent per
year) China Broadband should achieve its minimum target
penetration levels of one million subscribers in the first 5
years and significant growth thereafter. The Company charges its subscribers up to US$22 per month. With
average subscriber acquisition costs of less than US$255, the
Company believes it will achieve rapid pay out and be profitable
within its first two years of operation. KEY INDUSTRY / COMPANY CONSIDERATIONS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Positioned to be both ChinaÂs most significant broadband
Internet access provider * CATV subscriber footprint of +14 million * Capitalizing and leveraging on its first mover advantage in
ChinaÂs Internet broadband sector * Proven Management Team * First fully approved deployment in Shekou, Shenzhen * Fully approved and deployed in Chengdu, Sichuan, Beijing,
Shanghai and Chongqing municipalities signed MOUÂs (memorandum of understanding) * Hunan and Fujian Province MOUÂs * Superior product (+50x speed, reliable, affordable, always on) * Target of + 1,000,000 subscribers by 2005, significant growth
thereafter exceeding US penetration * Co-operative Joint Ventures to avoid infrastructure costs * Exceptional Joint Venture Terms; exclusivity, profit sharing,
15 to 20 year long term contracts * Financing at NAV and Comparables, * Value added services revenues * EBITA positive early, profitable 4th quarter 2001 * IP Telephony Revenue potential, Mother of all   Markets * Well positioned to take advantage of ChinaÂs ascension to the
World Trade Organization (ÂWTOÂ) * US $11.8 million raised to date, cash position $2.8 million, no
debt, approx. $150k /month burn rate
INVESTMENT SUMMARY
The Company has no debt, raised US$11.8 million to date and has
$2.8 million in cash and an approximate burn rate of $150k/mth.
With a market capitalization of approximately $15 million (based
on fully diluted shares) China Broadband can offer investors
substantial upside potential if the Company can deliver on its
business plan and rapidly convert its exclusive and existing
cable subscriber footprint to Internet broadband subscribers. Over the past year China BroadbandÂs stock has lacked visibility
and has been flying under the market radar while management has
been quietly executing its business plan, signing joint ventures,
and rolling out service. As well, it has been caught like many
companies in the general down draft of the Internet / broadband /
fiber-optic blow off and the market has not recognized the
prospects of CompanyÂs cash flow valuation. The stock price is down significantly from its peak of US$9.50
for a variety of market reasons discussed in this profile.
However we feel the current stock price could go higher based on;
the favorable economics of China BroadbandÂs business model, the
CompanyÂs unprecedented CATV footprint of 14 million and growing
cable subscribers, and ChinaÂs WTO ascension this year. China
Broadband is consequently extremely well positioned to be both
China and the worldÂs most significant broadband Internet access
provider. We therefore are positive about the Company for the
short term and remain optimistic about the CompanyÂs
prospects and progress in the Chinese broadband market. China Broadband, under Matthew HeyselÂs leadership, has built up
an impressive team of senior managers and directors to guide the
Company. They have taken the Company from start-up to its
current state and the current team appears more than capable of
bringing the Company through its next phase of growth to
profitability. +>+>+>  TO READ THE FULL WRITE UP GO HERE:

New Century Companies, Inc. Provides Update on Pending Merger
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- New Century Companies, Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: NCNY - news) announced additional details
regarding its pending merger with Smith West, Inc.  The merger
will further position the Company as a leading, vertically
integrated provider of machinery and cylindrical turbine parts
for the power generation, defense and aerospace engine
The US machine tool industry is an industry with annual sales in
excess of $30 billion.  Upon consummation of the merger, the
combined companies will have expected annual sales for 2002 in
excess of $50 million and an order backlog between $70 and $80
million.  Smith West is operating three state-of-the-art
facilities in excess of 32,000 square feet each and has such high
profile clientele as GE Aircraft and Gas Turbine Divisions and
Honeywell.  Moreover, New Century has been experiencing a recent
upsurge in new orders from defense and power industry companies,
adding to the significant synergies between these two companies.
"Our long standing relationship with Smith West, as a client of
ours, will enable us to quickly and efficiently integrate the two
companies," said David Duquette, CEO of New Century Companies,
Inc.  "This combination places us at the top of list for many new
defense and energy projects.  The defense and energy industries
have recently enjoyed the benefit of obtaining significant
government contracts and we are just starting to see that trickle
down into our businesses.  We strongly feel that we will continue
to see a material increase in our sales as these companies fully
ramp up to meet their commitments."   +>+>+>  About New Century Companies, Inc. New Century, under its brand name Century Turn, specializes in

These savings, generally in the range of 40 to 60%, allow New
Century to be the most price competitive manufacturer of Vertical
Boring Mills in the U.S. These cost savings are passed on to New
Century customers and afford them the opportunity to manufacture
rotating turbine components for power generation at better costs. New Century machines are also used by manufacturers of jet engine
components, airplane landing gear parts, oil and gas components,
to name a few. New Century currently manufactures its machines in

THE WALLSTREET UNIVERSE REPORT - October 30, 2001
Hot Stock Profile Of The Week!
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY - OTCBB: UDCCF, UNIVERSAL DOMAINS
On Oct. 25, 2001--Universal Domains Incorporated ( OTCBB:UDCCF )
announced that it has closed the acquisition of 100% of VCL

VCL is a teleconferencing services company targeting clients
throughout North America. VCL gives the customer the power to
conduct automated conference calls, on their own, for small
groups or with the assistance of an operator for larger groups. A key component of VCL's business model is the ability to offer
clients a cost effective, yet scalable means of communications
that can be customized to meet individual customer needs. On
demand or scheduled conference calls allow the moderators control
to conduct their own conference calls in a convenient, quick and
cost effective manner. With firmly established relationships
within the industry and extensive knowledge of teleconferencing
technology, VCL is aiming to capture a substantial share of
revenues generated within the billion dollar teleconferencing
industry. UNIVERSAL DOMAIN (OTC BB:UDCCF.OB)
Monday's Closing Price  $0.20  per share	
52-week Range  $0.080 - $0.760

VCL's customer base will have access to undisrupted services

this industry is management's years of experience in providing
telecommunications services along with very competitive rates to

with key providers that will allow VCL to be a leader within the
teleconferencing industry. VCL's products and services can be
viewed at  The voice conference call market has posted unparalleled growth
over the past three years with annual growth averaging 30 to 40%.
This $2 billion dollar market is estimated to become a $17
billion dollar industry within the next 2 years.  This growth is
due, in large part, to the globalization of businesses around the
world and uneasiness within the travel industry due to recent
events.  Growth is also taking place because of the
implementation of the Regulation Fair Disclosure Act in the
United States that requires all public reporting companies to
make earnings and analyst conference calls, corporate media
announcements and other information available simultaneously to
all investors.  Similar changes in regulatory policies in
England, Canada and Japan are imminent.
+>+>+>  SUMMARY...  There is still an opportunity to invest
within the teleconferencing industry.  With the recent
acquisition of VCL Communications Corp.,    (OTCBB: UDCCF),  investors can participate in this rapidly
growing market.
