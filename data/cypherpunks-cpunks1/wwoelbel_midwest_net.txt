@_subject: crypto++ help 
I recently downloaded the crypto++ class library and am having a bit of
trouble getting things to happen.  I have read the text on the
source-filter-sink concept and was able to create a DES file encryptor.
What I would like to do is use either blowfish or IDEA to encrypt a variable
length data stream.  Does anybody have experience with this library?  A
short code snippet or similar help would be appreciated.

@_subject: List for crypto minus political rubbish 
I am looking for a source of info on crypto.  While this list is of interest
to (many) people, I find that the amount of political ranting outweighs any
nuggets of information concerning cryptography.  Pointers?
