@_subject: Apologies, but . . . 
I read Eric's "welcome" file several times after signing on and *know*
that I sent a request to unsubscribe to the correct address; I also recall his
stating that sending an unsub message here would tar and feather me as a
"newbie," but . . . two attempts to unsub via the prescribed route have yielded
nothing more than an additional 75 or more files from this list.
        I respect the effort being made but can recognize it when I'm over my
head:  I'm a poet not a programmer.  And I need help extricating myself from
this web.
        Thanks.
Charles Fishman
