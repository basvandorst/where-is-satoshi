@_subject: anon-HTTP server w/o root access 
I'd be happy to setup a machine at my providers site do run
a test of anonymized httpd.  From what I understand they wouldn't
mind helping either.
Within the next 6 months, there probably will be a number
of for pay anonymizer services availible on the net.  It just
makes too much sense for it to not happen.
