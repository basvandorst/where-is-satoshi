What threat model do you propose that would require this?
I can't think of anything that isn't contrived and couldn't be served by using 3DES.

More worrying is the disconnect between the front page summary and the
body of the review. If one only reads the summary, then one would only see
the gushing praise and not the SSH protocol 1-esque use of a weak CRC as a
integrity mechanism (section 3.4.4) or what sounds suspiciously like a
exploitable signed vs. unsigned issue in protocol parsing (section 3.4.6).
Also disappointing is the focus on the correct implementation of
cryptographic primitives (why not just use tested commercial or
open-source implementations?) to the exclusion of other more interesting
questions (at least to me):
- What properties does the proprietary key agreement protocol offer (it
  sounds a bit like an attenuated version of the SSH-1 KEX protocol and,
  in particular, doesn't appear to offer PFS).
- Does the use of RC4 follow Mantin's recommendations to discard the
  early, correlated keystream?
- How does the use of RC4 to generate RSA keys work when only 64 bits of
  entropy are collected from Skype's RNG? (Section 3.1)
- Why does Skype "roll its own" entropy collection functions instead of
  using the platform's standard one?
- Ditto the use of standard protocols? (DTLS would seem an especially
  obvious choice).
- What techniques (such as privilege dropping or separation) does Skype
  use to limit the scope of a network compromise of a Skype client?
