Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that PGP's included outlook
plugin provides options for automatic encryption/digital signatures...

ACTUALLY, quantum computing does more than just halve the effective key
length. With classical computing, the resources required to attack a given
key grow exponentially with key length. (a 128-bit key has 2^128
possibilities, 129 has 2^129, etc. etc. you all know this...)
    With quantum computing, however, the complexity of an attack grows only
polynomially. Hence a MUCH MUCH more agreeable time frame for brute force
attacks. Good stuff, eh?

Someone should suggest the use of Putrescine to Lt. Mathers... The
chemical odor of decaying bodies is so sickening that Glade couldn't stand a
chance. Anyone know a readily available way for synthesizing this stuff? A
dead body lets off very small quantities of it, awful in itself. Distilled
Putrescine would reduce the most stalwart of us to dry heaves.
