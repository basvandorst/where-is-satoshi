actually, contrary to almost all other cases of censorship (not that I
say this isn't) the german state of bavaria owns the COPYRIGHT of "mein
kampf", and as such actually has some kind of standing in most of the
cases. yeah, it's still censorship, but at least they were bright enough
to do it in an intelligent way. in essence, only copies printed before
1945 are actually legal, because the copyright owner (bavaria) has not
authorized any later printings.

the point is that almost everyone even here is not willing to go to jail
or worse for "another tiny bit of privacy". we don't draw a sharp
boundary. we don't say, for example, that knowing my street is ok, but
knowing my house number is over the line.
and the total population is even worse. the vast majority of internet
users would give you pretty much anything for a minimal return ("one
hour free surfing"), and everything else for a larger one ("$100 for my
political and sexual preferences? sure.")
the muslim veil, on the other hand, IS a sharp boundary. as I understand
it, it is NOT permisable to lift it in public under ANY circumstances.
rounding that up, I'd guess that if we were religious about our privacy,
things may be different (possibly just more ugly, but who knows).

and you seriously believe you can debunk a point by pointing out that

"evil" could, I believe, be *defined* as "the term pretty much everyone
uses to describe his or her enemies". on the other hand, I don't know
many people who don't consider themselves righteous, good, etc.

by virtually any faction in power during a given time. it's not been too

or indians, right? "the only good indian is a dead indian".
all of our countries have a bloody past. some are just more recent than
others. all were over before I was born, so they're all alike to me.
as to your question: you are close. there are, of course, a lot of
things wrong with killing any large number of any people. however, try
describing one completely without adding a personal belief or ethic
example: killing 1 mio. jews is evil, because - because of what? there's
a lot of "becauses", but none of them works without a subjective set of
ethics. you won't find a "because" that has the structure of, say, a
mathematical proof.
I agree.
you are changing the meaning of "we" without noticing it. in the 2nd
paragraph, "we" means pretty much everyone. in the third, "we" is much
smaller. for example, the nazis would certainly have agreed to calling
iron "eisen" (the german word for "iron"). however, they didn't call the
mass murdering of jews that.
maybe that's because they were evil, but now you have a snake that's
eating it's own tail, because you allow only people who are not evil to
define what evil means.
that's because they are so readily abused by them. almost everyone is
prone to not listening to what someone else really has to say, but to
draw conclusions quickly. go into any anti-nazi newsgroup and argue a
careful position, ask for evidence and draw conclusions only from facts.
want to make a bet on how long it takes until you're called a nazi?
to the politicians: the point here is that they could expect (and were
obviously right so) that the vast majority of readers has a very
similiar definition of "evil" and other details of ethic background. had
they spoken not to their own people, but to the people of serbia, they
could not have "crossed the gap" with such ease.
it's almost a shame that the cultural differences on the globe become
smaller and smaller every year. today, if you want to find a really
interesting example (people who think it's unacceptable to, say, eat in
public) today, you have to refer to some almost-extinct tribe in the
middle of somewhere nobody ever heard about.

stop telling me what I'm implying, will you? I'm quite confident that I
know that better than you do.
only if you change the subject, as you did above. all along we've been
talking about "evil". suddenly, in your two examples above, the word
doesn't appear anymore. pointing out a potential danger is NOT the same
as putting a moral label on something.
that's why the "say" is there. it's an example, one possibility, a
counter-point to the ethical argument. it's not all-inclusive.
but the point is that the one point can be settled, the other not. it's
hard to maintain that iron is copper in face of all evidence. it seems
to be very easy to continue believing that "only a dead
indian/jew/arab/american/nip/whatever is a good one" even if the whole
world is convinced otherwise.
if dying for your belief proves you wrong, xianity has been wrong from
the start. (not that I wouldn't agree on that point)
but you're playing bait&switch again. you're moving from evil to wrong
to murderous as it pleases your argument. try to stick to the one term
we're discussing. we can talk about "wrong and right" afterwards, it's
no less interesting, but it IS a different point.
so? I don't understand why you're arguing at length for something that's
never been questioned. the point is that calling this "evil" is a
subjective point and that there is no such thing as "objective evil".
I don't care for right and wrong at this point. I don't care for murder
or not, or for 1 mio., 10 mio. or 50 mio. dead. it's not that I'm
indifferent to those questions, it's just that they simply aren't the
interesting. I've been labeled nazi in german newsgroups pretty much
immediatly for pointing out a few real factual errors in someone's
argument. maybe the anti-nazi groups over here are much more touchy than
please not start an argument about "the people of X are so stupid that
we, the enlightened people of Y have to save them from themselves". I
dare to say that permutations of that argument have killed more people
in history than any other reason has.
it's always those who believe they are the good ones who cause the most
evil. feeling yourself divine just pulls out the stops.

weird, a couple thousand years of history disagree with you. until the
very recent past, pretty much everyone was sure that killing enemies,
unbelievers or other people isn't "evil". probably isn't even "murder".
ironically, you seem to agree somewhat that bombing a couple hectars of
an "evil nation" isn't murder, either...
I never disagreed on the pragmatic point. however, there's still a vast
difference between "I'm afraid X might kill me, too" and "X is evil".
two examples: you can be afraid of becoming victim of a natural
disaster, but I don't think you'd label that evil. OTOH I'm fairly sure
that someone can earn the "evil" label without killing a single being.
nice, but old trick of passing judgement on someone in such a form that
it also invalidates his (possibly different) judgement on you. but it's
just cheap dialectics, not "truth".
remember that many more non-germans died in WW2 than germans. we really
shouldn't use body-count as a measure of truth.
during the invasion of poland, the polish casualties were several orders
of magnitude higher than the german ones. according to your logic, these
people died because they believed erreneous that they should defend
themselves against german aggression. according to your logic, they were
fools and others should have learned from their errors. france
definitely shouldn't have defended itself, should it? but they were
fools, according to your argument, and died as a result of their error.
others should have learned and stopped opposing the germans.
you can't judge history while it's still in the making. unfortunately,
history is pretty much always unfinished. some ancient greek ideas that
were burried 2000 years ago were resurrected earlier this century.
there's no "right" and "wrong" in history, only events. we are the ones
who put signs unto the events, blinding ourselves to the fact that
anything a subject does is by definition subjective.
"evil regimes" aren't the only ones who try to control information as
much as possible. pretty much every corporation believes that it needs
an extensive PR machinery in order to control the flow of information
about itself.
"evil regimes" just couple this desire with the ability to actually
conduct an extensive control.
then again, I don't quite see your point here. you happily proceed to
define qualities of "evil", skipping by the very step of declaring
something evil that's the whole point of this discussion.
who decides what is wrong and right in moral beliefs? you ever had any
sex outside a marriage? not long ago, that was widely accepted as being
one of the worst sins imaginable.
there's no "right" or "wrong" in morals. there's just people who declare
certain things to be one or the other.
oh, and don't rest your points on anyone's predictions not having come
true. for every marx who made predictions that didn't happen, there's 10
non-marxs who did the same.
your point is? that the percentage of "friendly fire" defines what is
right and what is wrong?
sorry, I disagree heavily.
"1+1=3" is wrong, but neither evil nor murderous. then, there's a lot of
"sinful", "wrong" or "evil" things in every culture that have nothing to
do with murder. and there's even murder that is not regarded as wrong or
evil by lots of people, such as the death sentence.
these things may be related, but they're definitely not identical.
that's two broad categories and two broad predictions. you could just as
well write "that's just the way it is".
I'm tired of this, so let's cut it short: if "evil" is objective, there
ought to be a way to measure it. an objective test that says "evil" or
"not evil". name it.

so he who murders his brother is by definition evil? with or without a

you didn't answer my two core questions, so I'll present them again in a
short and easily digestable form:
1.) those you call "evil" will often see things the other way around.
how do you resolve this issue without circular reasoning? (i.e. without
saying that their judgement doesn't count because they're "evil")
2.) if "evil" is objective, there ought to be an objective measurement
that can be applied to answer the question of a given person being
"good" or "evil". name this measurement.

not at all. it's the "who are you to believe you can pass judgement on
all of human history?" argument.
you forgot intend. otherwise, innocent bystanders who get hit will
always call the "good" guys who missed the target "evil" (according to
your definition), and rightly so.
but even with intend it doesn't work too well. your local police force
will gladly introduce you to the concept of doing hurtful things to you
without requiring you to do some to them first. all you have to do is,
say, speed on the highway and refuse to stop when they ask you to.
your definition works, I can't deny that, but only for extreme cases
such as the nazi regime. then again, the nazis *were* convinced that the
jews were not only doing bad things to them, but had been doing so for
hundreds of years (the "jew world conspiracy", zion, etc).
I'm afraid the nazis would have agreed to your definition just as well,
pointing out the necessity of eliminating the jew conspiracy, or the
whole world will suffer greatly.
what about the israel/rest-of-the-near-east problem? both sides call
themselves good and the other side evil. both sides have done and
received their fair share of killing. both sides are convinced that the
other will do hurtful things to them unless they get 'em first.
is one or both of them evil? your "definition" doesn't answer that
question. as I said, it works as a simplification for extreme cases,
much like the florida election system works fine unless it's a close

I don't deny that the nazi (and communist) MURDERS were without equal.
but again, we're not talking about murder, we're talking about evil,
with murder being one (possibly the best?) example of murder. there's
other evils beside murder. (rape, for an example that's widely
considered to be of roughly the same degree).
you are too fixated on war. I wasn't talking about war. and besides,
even in war it's a little sarcastic to tell the family who just lost its
mother that "shit happens" and that the "laws of war" which say that
shit happens are universally excepted, so rejoice and be happy, it's all
for the greater good.
innocent bystanders get hit in ALL circumstances. there's a lot of death
every year when police forces shoot innocents. there's a lot of "small
scale" military action that's not yet quite war (such as most of the
recent US activity which is better described with the words "world
police" than "war").
if you leave out intend, then you running over the neighbor's kid by
100% accident makes you evil, because you did hurtful things to them
without them doing any to you first.
yepp, we agree completely that they're all insane. the difference is:
...that I don't label them "evil", and by doing so - according to your
definition - declare a right for myself to take 'em out.
your problem is still circular reasoning. the arabs who say that the US
is evil are wrong because they are evil, and they are evil because you
say so (or because your definition says so, which is pretty much the
same). your problem is that it works perfectly well the other way
around: james who says that the nazis are evil is wrong because he is
himself evil, and he is evil because the nazis say so (because if he
says bad things about the nazis, he must be part of the jew world
conspiracy). on a pure logical level, these two statements have
identical truth values. since they collide, the only possible conclusion
is that they're both wrong.

@_date: 2000-12-21 15:16:00

you are ignoring that "the nazis" is a far larger group than james is.
also, you're only arguing body count. the nazis were not arguing that
the jews were KILLING the "aryan race", at least not in the immediate
murder sense.
of course the comparison is flawed. to make it more equal, one would
have to compare two groups, say the jews and the nazis. both thought of
the other as the ultimate evil. the nazis went to kill the jews,
justifying their deeds with the fear that the jews would otherwise be
doing evil to them. according to james' definition, they (the nazis)
were actually the GOOD guys!
that's the point. you can use the "evil people are those who harm
others, good people are those who fight evil people" definition to
justify ANYTHING. now I definitely don't say the nazis are good (my
grandfather died in a nazi prison). I just say that even though I would
agree calling them "evil", that is still a subjective category, and I
don't demand that the rest of the universe agree with me.
the difference is that your "I say" are comments about actual,
observable events in the outside world. james' "I say" relate to
non-observable phenomena, where a "verification through observation"
approach isn't in the range of options.

james, this is EXACTLY what I'm getting at. your line works perfectly,

what you SHOULD do (for ssh) is: generate keys on a stand-alone machine
that's known to be secure. put them on floppy/cd/smartcard/whatever and
distribute them around the servers by actually walking up to them (i.e.
no network). set SSH to paranoid settings (e.g. automatically rejecting
unknown keys, etc.). done. it's a bunch of work, but you only have to do
it once.
of course, intruders, malicious insiders, etc can still exchange the
keys. but that's not an encryption problem and is true for every other
piece of software on those machines (if you had an intruder, you've
gotta toast and setup up anew the machine anyways).
and obviously, there's simply no software or infrastructure fix for user
stupidity. even if you take the choice out of the user's hands, someone
will simply write a software that  enables it again and land a
bestseller (or best-downloader).

*IF* killing people (this way) is the definition of evil, and there is
no other way to be evil but by being a murderer, *THEN* you are
perfectly right.
I still think murder and "evil", while touching each other, are not
identical. I still think you're overly simplificating the problem, and

putting watermarking aside, this is the core. the normal use for
encryption is to make sure only a few people can access the information.
the movie/record/content "protection" purpose is not, you still want to
distribute your stuff high and wide, to as many people as possible. you
can say "authorized access" in both cases, but it has a different
meaning. both "root" and "ftp" ask for a password when you log into the
FTP server, but they're hardly on the same level.
therefore, software (and hardware) does and needs to work differently in
these cases. you don't use PGP for DVDs, you invent CSS.
I do think these things are farther apart than they appear. what it
boils down to is that the "protection" scheme doesn't seriously want to
stop anyone accessing the content. what it really wants is to make sure
he's following the rules (such as paying a fee). this is more an
authorization/permission system than an encryption one.

no, you are not. you are using a very specific form of murder as your
"objective fact" which determines evil. how many more are there, for
other forms of murder, for other forms of harm? for evil without
moral, by definition, is a function of culture. and the first case has
already been kicked out dozens of times (because it includes accidents).
besides, it's not at all neutral - some cultures consider certain forms
of suffering as good (including some xian sects).
in the extreme cases, things are obvious, which is NOT the same thing as
being objective. just because the sky is obviously blue doesn't mean
it's an objective fact. in fact, "the sky" doesn't even exist.
now, to drag this thing a little bit closer to the topic, the
interesting cases are those which are NOT extreme. what about the
movie/record mafia and other control freaks? are they "evil"? they're
not (yet) killing anyone, but they're surely doing harm (ask the people
involved in the DeCSS case who've spent a couple thousand bucks on
defending themselves). and more specifically: where is the line where
they've become or will become "evil"?
a good point was made by bruce perens on a /. forum: we cry murder when
someone attacks the tools (decss, peacefire, napster, ...) instead of
those who abuse them to do bad things (pirates etc). on the other hand,
we are outraged about stuff like the recent IBM plans to encrypt
harddrives - i.e. the tool, even before anyone has done anything bad
with it.
we're all a little israeli/arab. calling our opponents "evil" is just a
tool of psychological warfare.

in a follow-up to the recent discussion (mostly between Riad Wahby and

of the details down.
however, there are some crypto-related specifics I'm lacking. if anyone
can help, I'd be happy.
most importantly, is there an implementation of rivest's "all-or-nothing

feel confident enough to create it myself.

I've done a simple chaffing and winnowing implementation, and would like
to invite everyone interested to have a look and give comments.
download: ftp://ftp.lemuria.org/pub/Code/Shaft-0.1.tar.gz
requires: openssl (for hmac)
the program consists of two parts: shaft will encode/decode, while
shaftsort will sort the chunk within a file. shaftsort has two purposes:
first, shaft relies on sorted input when decoding. second, the standard
shaft output is sorted by input files, which makes the whole chaffing
process more or less irrelevant.
bugs: some trailing zeros in final output, and shaftsort still retains
the "order by input file", which is a Bad Thing(tm). it should take all
the chunks with identical sequence numbers and resort them randomly or
by some arbitrary definition ("first 3 data bytes").
usage: see the test.sh or the source. basically, for encryption, shaft
wants input files and keys/passwords on the commandline. for decryption
it wants just one key. shaftsort is a filter (stdin to stdout).

I disagree.
"the government" is a term for more than the people, even for more than
the people making up "the government". lumb them all into a football
stadium and you don't have a government - just a bunch of people.
there's an organizational structure that makes up "the government", and
in most western countries it's stronger than the people - you can
basically exchange them all without too much of a change to "the
government" (as proven after every election). but change the structure
while retaining the people and you end up with something completely
different (e.g. germany's transition from the weimar republic to the
third reich).
in that sense "let's get rid of the government" *can* be interpreted as
"let's tear down these structures". it not always *is* meant that way,
but it *can*. and of course the opinions about what to replace it with
differ a lot. but most of those who are anti-government don't so much
say "let's kill president X or minister Y" as rather "the voting system
is crap" or "government is bought by the big corporations" or "there
should be no authority at all" or something to that effect, which is
definitely a *structural* as opposed to a *personal* complaint.

that's a problem. if no such algorithm exists, I suggest that - for this

- dictionary of 100 most common words from english plus a couple other
  languages. if more than 1% of the text fits, it's either plaintext or
  a really weird cipher.
- look for PGP-style "encrypted message starts here" tags
- look for "multipart/encrypted" headers
it's not perfect, but it should do if the mailer policy clearly explains
that's not the issue, is it? the purpose here is:
a) make the remailer spam-proof. the requirement to encrypt every mail
(i.e. encrypt 1000 times if you send to 1000 people) drives the costs
for spam up to where it no longer pays the bills.
b) make the remailer censor-proof. if I can show that I have no idea of

I'm currently looking for a way to get encrypted data via stego to
people who live in countries where crypto is illegal, and who may be
watched. so just sending them a large graphic would likely arouse
the 2 best solutions I've come up with so far are porn and spam. both
are readily believable, even in large quantities.
the problem with porn is that it may be illegal in itself in the same
countries. the problem with spam is that ascii text just doesn't offer
much to hide stego in (whitespacing, etc. is both easy to find and can
store very little data).

MP3 ?
let's mix that with an idea I've been discussing in private mail. here's
a proposal:
set up a service that you can subscribe to. say:  -
fill out a profile and we select a random number of songs from our huge
archive of free mp3s that we believe you will like (snippets actually,
with links to the full-length version). there's a constantly changing
webpage for you that shows a list of songs. if you heard one (by
clicking on the link), it's removed, and sometime later (all random!) a
new one will be added.
set up a second service, say:  - where you can
subscribe for an e-mail address. however, we don't forward the mails to
you, we stego them into an mp3. you automatically get a subscription
with the first service as well, except that the number of songs isn't
random for you, it's the number of mails you got.
to avoid checksum creation, the snippets are made randomly and/or all
songs  have a "watermark" (with timestamp) implemented by, guess what,
steganographic means.
comments? the dailymusic.com service serves as a deniability front.
since there is NO hint on it's website to the other service, you can
plausably deny that you know about that one.

several have been discussed here over the past week or so. none are

a describeable structure) and encrypted stuff (which, too, has a

station. Then just continue down the Reeperbahn until you see the place
(see pictures).
At St. Pauli you will also want to leave through the "back" exit. You
should be at a large crossing with a bus station in front of
you (2nd picture in the set). Turn to the right and you should already
see the building (see pictures).
if you have any questions left, or need help in finding a place to sleep
or transport towards hamburg, contact me (tom at ricardo.de)

I'm looking for a way to insert information (new pages, updates...) in
such a way that it is impossible to find out where the information was
injected. i.e. one node is the "master node", but nobody except it
knows who. only the master node can insert information.
bonus problem: in case the master node fails, the protocol should allow
for a pre-determined (by the master node) other node to take over. who
the "successor" is should not be known to anyone except the master node
and maybe the successor.

that part is actually the least of my worries. the threat model is that alice's system has possibly been compromised or
shut down, but alice herself (and thus the private key or at least the
passphrase) is still secure. the story would continue with alice digging
out the mirrors and redirecting her web traffic there, so if alice goes
down, things are lost anyways.
that's the problem. so how does alice know if bob doesn't tell?

once again I'm asking for some details/help on what looks ever more like
a pure anonymity problem. maybe I should start with revealing what it's
all for, since I'm pretty much stuck there at the moment. point your
browser to  if you want and take a look.
there's not much there at the moment, but should be enough to give you a
basic idea. in short, it's kind of an archive for thought crime. a
little like cryptome but with a different topic and philosophy. most
importantly, it's only a front. the actual data store is somewhere else,
e.g. freenet. so when the thugs kick in my door and take the machine,
nothing whatsoever is lost.
now since some of the information archived there will surely be illegal
in one or more countries, what is needed is guaranteed anonymity for
pretty much everyone involved (except the publisher, who's taking a risk
but can drop out at any time without destroying the data). some of the
related problems are solved, many not. one of the worst unsolved so far
is what I call "hidden update".
in short, I need a way for Alice to give Bob a piece of information with
neither Alice nor Bob knowing each other. however, Bob should have a way
to verify that subsequent messages are coming from the same Alice. bonus
points if there's a way for Bob to send messages to Alice, too.
main problem: the need to implement the above with existing and readily
available infrastructure.
one solution I've come up with so far is for Alice to encrypt to Bob's
(anonymously published) key and post via remailers to, say,
alt.anonymous.messages, which Bob is known to read. alternatively, agree
on one or more porn/binary newsgroups and use stego.

but behind the scenes, practically anything that M$ or someone who can
pay them enough for the favour doesn't like can be disabled. say that
plugin which encrypts your passwords before storing them on the disk. of
course, the program has a fallback to write plaintext passwords if it

lawmakers have been trying to make drugs or prostitution or religion
illegal at various times over the past 5000 years or so and the success
has always been pretty much zero. with the new technology, we'll just
add a few more areas, that's all. the law can move out of the way or get

I don' think there's an out-of-the-box solution for this one so far. if
there is, I'd be very interested in it myself.
one low-tech solution would be using SSL. set up a dedicated machine
that talks on smtps, but not on the normal smtp (which makes sure your
inbound traffic is encrypted). the listmails are send EXCLUSIVELY to
local users, who can read them via an IMAP server which also doesn't
allow unencrypted access.
of course, that may not be feasable if you're talking about an open
forum, where readers come and go all the time, but you sounded like you
had a more closed target audience.

@_subject: The Key Vanishes: Scientist Outlines Unbreakable Code 
essentially, a one-time-pad with a central source of randomness, the key
being the point in the random-number-stream that you start with.
I agree completely on that, but for very different reasons.
a) ok, it *is* unbreakable, since it's a one-time-pad. however, that
only refers to mathematics/cryptoanalysis, not to the wide variety of
other attacks.
of course, that's the first thing coming to mind. however, I have other
c) the system's security rests entirely on the fact that the data volume
is so "enormous" (10 mio. mio bits per second).
or is it? high-energy research (CERN, etc.) today generates terrabytes
of data everytime they hit the "on" switch. the computer centres there
are equipped to handle two-digit terrabyte volumes in very short times.
the problem is that the security of your message increases linear with
the time you wait before sending it, because said time determines the
likeliness that eve has run out of storage space and has started to
overwrite old data.
d) that, however, isn't even the worst problem. since bob also has to
record the stream in order to decrypt the message, alice has to say
"start" at a time X. all eve has to do is also hit the "record"
what this system does protect against is eve finding the message and her
desire to decrypt it AFTER the fact.
but it doesn't offer any advantage over existing systems in this area.
the main danger of them is that either alice or bob store the
one-time-pad or plaintext somewhere. that's a danger entirely outside
the cryptosystem and not dealt with in this one, either.
(*) one might think that no explicit "start" is required, since bob can
just start grabbing the stream "live" while receiving the message.
however, that requires perfect syncrocity(sp?) between alice and bob,
something that is quite impractical at the requested flow rate.
a solution here would be to have the random numbers broadcasted over the
very medium which is used to transport the messages, much like the
cycling in your PC. practical problems of a wide-area useage of this
aside, it would only make it even easier for eve to decrypt the message,
since she receives the key right alongside it. in other words: the whole
encryption business would be a trivial waste of computing power.
if that's not enough:
e) the central source of randomness is sure to be a major target of any
attacker. just by replacing the randomness with a seemingly-random
function that you can easily recreate, eve would save tremendous amounts
of storage space while lulling everyone in the impression of having an
"unbreakable" cipher.

good point, but IMHO it actually makes the system WEAKER yet, because it
gives more feeling of security to alice and bob, which may be highly
betraying because it also adds  key-exchange trouble and we all know
that is the real weakness of many systems.
my point exactly. one way or the other you can't TRUST the stream,
therefore it is worthless.
especially when it's sitting in orbit, where even if you wanted to and
were allowed to you simply CAN'T get at it.
and it's pretty obvious that examining it while it's still down on earth
does nothing. any stage magician worth his money can switch things right
under your nose, and any of the major TLAs would surely be capable to
switch a satellite even with dozens of people believing they've been
watching it continuously.
didn't think of that. yet another nail in the coffin. so, what do we
have? a scientist (or is he? anyone checked the credentials?) who is
much better at generating media hype than at cryptography. :)

original poster of this thread had a specific problem. it doesn't matter
if an algorithm satisfies some arbitrary and, to be brutally honest,
mental-masturbation definition of perfect cryptography detection.
incidently, since he is working in a closed environment and CAN dictate
the crypto to be used (within limits, such as the requirement that the
software for it be available on all used platforms), the very
requirement you mention as the critical is in fact not only uncritical,
but not even a problem.

ok, let's try to tackle this problem seriously, for the crypto value (or
lack thereof):
that is a different problem that has, in fact, been answered by me
you will have to trust something. then you use that something to verify
something else, that is what:
see above. or check what web-of-trust means. for for this problem, we
have the following steps (in no specific order):
1.) verify that my friend is an authority on the issue
2.) verify that my friend actually exists
3.) verify the information exchange between you and and my friend
everything else is parts of that. for example, my person only enters the
picture as a middle man between you and my friend. if you trust me
(which you don't) then I can make steps 1 and 2 for you and all that's
left is to make sure that you receive the correct information from me,
which could be solved by signing the mail cryptographically.
since you don't trust me, you will have to either establish trust to me,
or proceed to verify these steps on your own.
I've known this person for over 10 years. I'm pretty confident that any
attempts to replace him with someone else in such a way as to fool me
would be several orders of magnitude more expensive than the gain is
how you do this depends mostly on your threat-model. for this example,
the threat is small - it's not like any TLA would throw a couple million
dollars at this in order to fool you, right? ergo I can assume that a
replacement by someone who can fool me for several hours is extremely
dumb jim. :)
it's not meant to be any more trustworthy than my words. in fact, it's
sole purpose (in this case) is to ensure that my words are really my
words. it's part of step 3 above.
if they are stamped with an official seal (which in the case of the
military I'm quite sure they are) then you can be sure that any of 3
cases is true:
a) they are valid
b) the government (or other place of origin of the seals) is in on the
c) a forger with more skill than your forgery-detection method is in on
the conspiracy
in the case of a question about ammunition, both b) and c) are highly
unlikely. again, you have applied the highest possible threat model to a
case where even a medium one would be paranoia.
wrong. we can solve your problem IF you present us with a list of those
things that you DO trust. from there on, trust can be extended. e.g. if
you trust your own eyes, then visiting both Tim and me can assure you
that there are two DIFFERENT entities claiming to be Tim and Tom. you
can then verify whether they really are what they claim, the method of
verification again depending on what instances you trust. for example,
if you trust the german government to keep correct records, you could
check those on me (birth certificate, etc) to verify that I am who I
claim to be.
you have also got to take the threat model into account. in the worst
case, there is no trust because you're living in The Matrix and what you
see with your own eyes doesn't even exist.
in the end, trust and verification aren't binary if you meet real life.
you can never be 100% sure that I am who I claim to be. however, you can
gradually increase your verification/trust factor by any of the
processes outlined above and/or an unlimited number of other ones.

I love it when you conflict with yourself. :)
so you trust the proof. great. if you trust the proof, and the protocol
has just been proven, then your trust extends to the protocol. and so
on. web-of-trust.
please don't say you don't. because if a protocol that was just proven
by a prove you trust has not earned your trust by that procedure, then
obviously you lied when you said you'd trust the prove.
the PGP web-of-trust is a specialized version of the above. if you trust
me, and I say that key X really belongs to person Y, then your trust
extends to the validity of the key. not further, it doesn't mean you
trust person Y, it just means that because you trust me you decide to
believe that the key really belongs to that person, because I say so.
we're talking PUBLIC keys here. my public key is available to anyone who
knows what "finger" means.
still didn't get it? ok, so here's the same in math form:
if A==B and B==C then A==C
if replace == with "trust". if A trusts B and B trusts C then A can
trust C. that's a gross oversimplification, so please don't start any
nitpicking. I said a couple of words about trust not being binary in the
last mail. in essence, the == should read "total, complete, absolute
trust in everything", something that I doubt you'd see anywhere in real
life. the more precise formula would be:
A trusts B (minus margin of mistrust) and B trusts C (minus margin of mistrust)
therefore A trusts C (minus (margin of mistrust AB * margin of mistrust
BC) )
why not? please tell.
again, you're applying the wrong threat model. if this were about
whether or not I should tell him about the new superweapon that I've
been developing in my function as a super-secret scientist, your threat
model might apply. since we're talking about a simple question about
ammunition here, your threat model is way off.
in german, we say "mit kanonen auf spatzen schiessen" - roughly
translated as "firing cannons on sparrows". I don't. since I'm not omniscient, I can live with that fact. we're all
living our lifes on assumptions, or we'd be insane. maybe you should get
in touch with reality every once in a while?
excuse me? all the signature says is "these words were really written by
Tom". in short: it's "trust" is on a completely different level than
those of my words. I can sign a fictional story. you wouldn't trust my
words, but you could trust that they are, indeed, *my* words.
that would be case b) or c), depending on who's responsible.
subcase of c).
you're missing the point. this is not about a complete list of all
possible ways to get an official seal on some document.
"things" in the broadest possible sense of "pretty much anything".
lots of that is not trust, but believe, but let's ignore that. :)
ok, let's focus:
the question was: what kind of ammunition does the G3 use?
the proposed solution was: I know someone who should know, I can ask him
and relay the answer.
your problem is: you trust neither me nor - should he even exist - the
one I proposed to ask.
solution to your problem: we need a protocol that you can verify
("prove") that will in return prove that the someone exists and does
know what he's supposed to know and that he is speaking the truth. I at
this stage ignore the "official document" crap and every other actual
means of verification, since you wouldn't trust them anyhow.
as a matter of fact, I think it would be much more simpler if you'd just
buy a G3 and check for yourself.
correct if trust is binary. since it's not, the trust I have in you
would have to include a "grant option", i.e. if I trust you to have
friends that are trustworthy, then yes I would trust bill.
secret keys - of course not, that's why they're called "secret".
you've never sent a public key over the network?

I don't say trust and proof are identical. what I do say is that proof
extends trust. if you trust the proof, then you can trust whatever it
i.e. if you trust that you do have some method to determine the truth
value of anything I say, then that means if your method says "he says
the truth" you can trust in what I have said. not because I said it or
because you trust me, but because you trust the method which says I'm
saying the truth.
on a crypto level: if you have a protocol that can verify whether or
not, say, a given coin of a given cyber-money is "ok" (not already
spent, of the value it claims to be, etc.) then you can accept said coin
from me. even if you do not trust me in any other thing, you just
created a trust in that single coin. your trust in the protocol just
extended to a trust in the coin, by application of the protocol. you
didn't trust the coin before, you trust it afterwards. proof was just
the method. there's a lot of trust that exists without proof (some of
which you mentioned in your last mail).
while I did say that, I also wrote a lengthy clarification about it.
please refer to the full claim, not a single, selective quote which has
a significantly different meaning.
the full claim was:
===quote start===
if A==B and B==C then A==C
if replace == with "trust". if A trusts B and B trusts C then A can
trust C. that's a gross oversimplification, so please don't start any
nitpicking. I said a couple of words about trust not being binary in the
last mail. in essence, the == should read "total, complete, absolute
trust in everything", something that I doubt you'd see anywhere in real
life. the more precise formula would be:
A trusts B (minus margin of mistrust) and B trusts C (minus margin of mistrust)
therefore A trusts C (minus (margin of mistrust AB * margin of mistrust
BC) )
===quote end===
now that's a slightly different thing, don't you think? the mistrust in
the AC case can be quite large, not zero as your selective quote makes
that is exactly what I mean by "margin of mistrust" above. you may trust
me with taking care of your dog for a week while you don't trust me
taking care of your wife for an afternoon - that is EXACTLY what I mean
when I say that "trust in real life is not binary".
bullshit. the protocol just needs to be simple enough. returning to my
cyber-money example above, we DO have a protocol of verification of
physical money in real life. it's not perfect, but it works reasonably
well. it works by having specific coins or bills for money so that by
visual identification and verification you can accept money from a total
stranger in good faith.
yes, forgery does exist. as I've said a couple dozen times so far: there
are no perfect protocols and no absolute trust in real life. but guess
what, civilization works more or less ok without, unless you are jim and
apply the maximum threat model to every step of your life.

that is a good point, but I am not quite convinced. let's first say that
of course a proof does not create trust in anything but the subject of
it. so if I prove that I am me that means you can trust THAT part of my
words, but not necessarily anything else.
yes, we should really define the words we are using first.

I agree on "proof". for trust, I would rather say:
trust is that state in which the subject matter of it is believed to be

wouldn't that be perfect? a "collectable patent card game", as a way to
criticise patents (by using the most ridiculous ones on the cards),
which in itself violates a patent... hm, I like the idea...
"combine the 'patent for display of blablah' with the 'method or device
for remote information acquisition' and you can cross-license that
against your enemie's 'global computer network patent' for 10 points."

don't think so. it's a good observation, and most likely better than
yours unless we talk about infinities. there are libraries full of books
where neither nazis or hitler are even mentioned. yet usenet debates DO
converge on those topics with surprising pace. most likely a
psychological thing - the search for a recent, extreme and well-known
example or counter-example to your point. in the middle ages, one
would've used witchcraft and satan instead.
