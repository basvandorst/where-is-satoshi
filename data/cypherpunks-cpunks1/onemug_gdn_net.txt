So:  our free speech -- our ability to express ideas -- is now subject
to the imprimature of the US copyright office, who we need to appeal to
for "exemptions"?? How many *other* Federal Agencies do you think will step forth to claim
this power, as well???
One would certainly hope the courts would figure this one out as
blatantly unconstitutional....
