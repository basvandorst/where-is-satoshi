@_subject: Is there a Win PGP? 
PGP Inc. ( is now marketing Viacrypt PGP.
 There are two packages, Viacrypt PGP Personal Edition which is PGP, like we all know and love. PE also is available as DOS, MS-Windows, Mac, and UNIX. So Viacrypt PGP/PE for DOS should feel similar if not identical to MIT's PGP, though I haven't tested it yet.
 You could license IDEA single-license and license RSAREF for commerical usage ( or JonathanZ at consensus.com), but why  They also have a Business Edition which supports key escrowing, not some US government backdoor, but a 'master key' for businesses to recover encrypted information if an employee forgets a passphase (which they do), dies (which they do, if the information is very important), is on vacation (sometimes it happens), etc.
 In a commerical environment, key escrowing is for data recovery, not for spying on employees. If you want to use your employer's email system for your personal email, then use a personal public key.  -Michael
