remail at c2.org and remailer at soda.csua.berkeley.edu both run such things

For Immediate Release - December 20, 1995
Contact: Sameer Parekh sameer at c2.org 510-601-9777
COMMUNITY CONNEXION PIONEERS PRIVATE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE Community ConneXion today announced a new service for its customers
which will make secure, private electronic commerce more accessible to
all merchants, from the small single-person business to large
corporations trying to sell goods and services over the
The new service allows its customers to accept ecash, an anonymous,
secure electronic payment system, developed by DigiCash bv, of
Amsterdam, Holland and implemented with US Dollars by Mark Twain Bank,
of St. Louis, Missouri. Customers can setup web pages on their web
sites and charge websurfers from pennies to dollars per page when
viewing their sites. The technology allows anyone on the Internet to
become a merchant, selling goods and services electronically.
Community ConneXion's President, Sameer Parekh, commented on the new
development, "Before we unveiled this service, it was rather difficult
for a merchant to offer content on the web in exchange for private,
secure payment. Our system allows our customers to add simple
configuration directives to their web pages in order to start charging
for them." Information about Community ConneXion's ecash merchant
support is available on their webserver at Ecash is the only strongly private payment system available on the net
today. "All other consumer payment systems on the net are strongly
linked with the old-fashioned and outdated credit card system," said
Parekh. Ecash provides full payor anonymity and protects against fraud
using strong cryptographic protocols developed by David Chaum,
Managing Director of DigiCash.
"Community ConneXion continues to lead the world toward a more
efficient model of commerce on the Internet" said Frank Trotter, III,
Mark Twain Bank International Markets Division Director and Ecash
project leader.  "Integration of an Ecash payment mechanism into the
site is a giant step toward allowing business and research to function
and support itself efficiently.  We look forward to the continued
leadership in innovation from Community ConneXion."
Community ConneXion has been a supporter of ecash since its inception
in October of 1995, becoming the first internet provider in the world
to start accepting ecash as payment for services, less than one month
after the payment system was announced. Community ConneXion, founded in June of 1994, is the leading provider
of privacy on the Internet. They provide anonymous and pseudonymous
internet access and web pages in addition to powerful web services,
virtual hosts, and web design consultation. Information is available

For Immediate Release
Contact: Sameer Parekh 510-601-9777
COMMUNITY CONNEXION ANNOUNCES APACHE-SSL COMMERCE
Community ConneXion today announced Apache-SSL Commerce, a commercial
version of the Apache webserver with support for Netscape
Communication Corporation's Secure Sockets Layer, a standard for
encrypted communications over the Internet.
Community ConneXion's Apache-SSL package includes Apache v1.0.0,
extensions to Apache which enable the SSL protocol, additional
customizations to the webserver, and tools to aid in server and SSL
maintainence. The server supports virtual hosts and an extensible API
to allow for easy modifications to the behavior of the server. Apache
is currently the fastest growing HTTP server, looking set to become
the most used web server on the net in 1996.
Sameer Parekh, President of Community ConneXion, commented on their
release of the encrypting webserver, "We're very happy to make
available an affordable SSL server to the Internet community. For
security to work, it must be ubiquitous, which requires that
encrypting servers be affordable and widely deployed."
Apache-SSL is available for free to non-commercial users, and the
commercial use package, Apache-SSL Commerce, is available for
$495.00. Customers who own versions of other commercial encrypting
webservers can upgrade to Apache-SSL Commerce for $295.00.  In
addition to the right to use the server in commercial applications,
the commercial package includes support and free lifetime upgrades
from Community ConneXion.  Apache-SSL Commerce is not available
outside the United States, but Apache-SSL is available for free, both
commercially and non-commercially, outside the United States from Ben
Laurie, of A. L. Digital, Ltd.
The Apache-SSL Commerce webserver is the only commercial encrypting
webserver with source available. Ian Goldberg, graduate student at
U.C. Berkeley, well-known for his work on SSL security, commented on
the importance of available source, "The public release of source,
especially for security-critical sections of code, is vital for a
product in which the public must put its trust.  It's far better for
me to be able to check the software that's used, say, for accessing my
bank account via the Web, for security problems, than for me to be
forced to trust whatever company put out the product.  Companies will
soon find that releasing more information about the internals of their
products will lead not only to better products, but better
reputations, as well."
Portions developed by the Apache Group, taken with permission from the

developed by Ben Laurie for use in the Apache-SSL HTTP server project.
This product includes software developed by Eric Young
(eay at mincom.oz.au).

For Immediate Release
Contact: Sameer Parekh 510-601-9777 sameer at c2.org
PRINCETON STUDENTS FIND HOLE IN INTERNET SECURITY SOFTWARE
Two Princeton University grad students, Dan Wallach and Drew Dean,
recently discovered holes in Sun Microsystem's HotJava web browser. In
response to this finding, Community ConneXion, well known for offering
rewards for exposing holes in internet security products, has decided
to award them with a t-shirt and expand the Community ConneXion Hack
line of promotions to include Java and Java-related products.
Sun's Java product is alleged to allow people browsing the
World-Wide-Web to execute programs on their own computers without
worrying about whether or not the programs were viruses or not. The
holes Wallach and Dean found show that there are a few things in the
HotJava alpha implementation of the Java language which make viruses
and other malicious programs possible within the alpha HotJava
web browser.
"We were very impressed with the HotJava concept, so we thought it
would be good to poke around their implementation," said Wallach.
"While we did find some interesting holes, we believe these can be
addressed and Java could make a good standard for remote code on the
Web, if an effective security policy is defined."
Wallach and Dean released their findings initially in the RISKS
Digest, and plan to publish a paper detailing their results. The holes
they found make it possible for a malicious applet to set things up so
as to be able to monitor or modify all of a given web-surfer's
activity, after they ran the malicious applet exploiting the holes. By
doing so the applet may make it possible to violate user's privacy by
revealing to an third party their web traffic.
The holes they found exist only in the alpha release of HotJava. The
beta release, which is the version found in the widely-used Netscape
Navigator 2.0b1J is not vulnerable to these attacks.
"I don't want to be in the t-shirt business," said Sameer Parekh,
President of Community ConneXion, "but we felt that these students'
work deserved a t-shirt. Java has great potential for making the
Internet much more powerful than it already is. It is very important
that we examine Java and make sure that we can trust it." Community
ConneXion, in addition to this Hack Java t-shirt promotion, is
offering t-shirts to people who find holes in Netscape, Microsoft, and

For Immediate Release - November 17, 1995
Contact: Sameer Parekh sameer at c2.org 510-601-9777
COMMUNITY CONNEXION BECOMES FIRST INTERNET PROVIDER TO ACCEPT ECASH
Community ConneXion today announced that it has become the first and
only Internet Service Provider in the world to allow for payment using
ecash, a digital cash system developed by DigiCash bv, of Amsterdam,
Holland, released jointly with Mark Twain Bank, of St. Louis,
On October 23rd, DigiCash bv announced jointly with Mark Twain Bank
that they would be issuing ecash denominated in real U.S. Dollars. In
the past DigiCash had been running a trial "CyberBucks" payment
system, which was not backed by any strong currency; it was a form of
"Monopoly Money". The ecash system provides full payor anonymity. Consumers can use
ecash tokens to pay for goods on the Internet, with full anonymity
from the merchants. This lets consumers buy things without fear of
merchants compiling and selling databases of their spending habits. It
also allows for a convenient and safe mechanism for payment through
the Internet.
Sameer Parekh, President of Community ConneXion, said that ecash is a
significant improvement over the payment systems widely in use on the
net today. He described one example, "Currently people usually just
send their credit card numbers over the net to the merchant if they
want to buy something. This opens up the security risk of having the
merchant's computers broken into; every consumer's full credit limits
are then subject to attack. With ecash, only the limited sums that
have been spent are at risk."
Community ConneXion has begun accepting ecash as payment for its
services, offering a five percent discount for customers who pay with
ecash. "It simplifies our accounting and protects the privacy of our
clients; it is to everyone's benefit to use ecash," said Parekh.
"Ecash has greatly simplified account creation procedures for our
anonymous accounts. In the past someone creating an anonymous account
would need to wait until their payment arrived, and their check
cleared, before the account could be created; now, the account is
created automatically, immediately after the ecash payment is made
over the world-wide-web."
Community ConneXion is the leading provider of privacy on the
Internet. They provide anonymous and pseudonymous internet access and
web pages in addition to powerful web service, virtual hosts, and web
design consultation. Information is available from their web pages at

COMMUNITY CONNEXION TO OFFER REWARD FOR REVEALING HOLES IN ECASH
October 23, 1995 - Community ConneXion, an internet privacy provider
in Berkeley, California, announced the extension of its existing
"Hack" contests to the electronic cash system announced today by
Digicash bv and Mark Twain Bank.
"The ecash deployment an important step towards making internet
commerce more than just a curiosity," said Sameer Parekh, President of
Community ConneXion. The contest is meant, as with the other "Hack"
promotions being run by Community ConneXion, to encourage the
examination of the security of the ecash system so as to reveal holes
before they are exploited by a criminal element.
Community ConneXion hopes that the inquiry being done into the
security of these products results in a secure infrastructure for the
new paradigms provided by internet commerce. "All internet commerce
systems thus far released have been based in old, out-of-date,
insecure technology, such as credit cards. DigiCash is the first
revolutionary system which can change the way we do business," said
Parekh. "If the move to internet commerce does not radically improve
the way people do business, then we have not taken full advantage of
the potential inherent in the technology."
Details regarding the Hack DigiCash promotion are available on
Community ConneXion's webserver at Contest submissions should be sent to hackecash at c2.org.
Community ConneXion is the premier internet privacy ISP. They offer
anonymous accounts, remailers, and psuedonym servers, in addition to
the standard ISP fare of webspace and dialup IP access. Information is

My understanding of S/MIME isn't excellent, so I figure there are
things I could be confused about which may make this a bit wrong..
I figure a command line S/MIME program which could easily be
integrated into a remailer wouldhave the following features:
A) limit on number of multiple concurrent procersses doing
decryption. Remailer spams have the bad effect of spwaning hundreds of
concurrent PGPs on the mailhost, bringing things to halt. Limiting
number of concurrent decryptions would help this problem.
B) A strong interaction with the UNIX shell, with the program
returning a return code based on whether or not the decryption
succeeded. (Remailers only do decryptions...) That way a remailer
could something like:
if smime -f < incoming-message > /tmp/decrypted.$$
  # Process /tmp/decrypted
rm incoming-message
rm /tmp/decrypted.$$
would be none of that PGP v2.6.2 stuff that PGP sends out. Just the
decrypted output and if the message cant be decrypted, nothing gets
output. (Maybe a -q option for that..)
well, but I don't know premail to know what would be necessary for
that. I suspect Raph would have some input on that matter.

incentive to the net to expose security flaws in some software that is
advertised on the net as secure.
This weekend a member of the cypherpunks community, Ian Goldberg, and
his officemate, David Wagner, revealed a method which would allow
someone to break the encryption used by Netscape Navigator in 25
seconds. Netscape Communications Corporation has been advertising
their products as a "secure" way of communicating sensitive
information over the net. People have been using this Netscape
software to send their credit card numbers over the net, communicate
with their brokers, and other tasks requiring security.
"Netscape was apparently relying on security by obscurity in this
case," said Community ConneXion's founder, Sameer Parekh.
In light of this recent break and the earlier two brute force attacks
on the encryption used in the international version of Netscape
Navigator (crippled because of restrictions on the export of
cryptography from the United States) Community ConneXion has offered a
challenge to the net community to find more holes. Ian, David, and the
people responsible for the brute-force attacks will be receiving free
limited-edition T-shirts for their work.
"The more holes people find, the more holes will get fixed. Netscape
makes the most widely used commercial WWW software out there, so it is
in the net's best interest for netscape to have good security. By
exposing the holes in netscape, we will hopefully get them fixed,"
said Sameer.
Details about the HackNetscape promotion are available from
 or by sending mail to
hacknetscape at c2.org.
Community ConneXion is the premier internet privacy ISP. They offer
anonymous accounts, remailers, and psuedonym servers, in addition to
the standard ISP fare of webspace and dialup IP access. Information is
available from  or mailing info at c2.org.

no means a barebones webserver. It has a full-featured API which
allows dynamic loading of custom-written modules to handle every
aspect of web servering. Its configurations files, while not as
complex as sendmail config files, are rather complex. The server comes
with an "GUI administration tool", which allows you to configure the
server using netscape over HTTP to a special server, -running as
root-, which can modify configuration files, restart the server,
etc. (I am not sure if the administration server -must- run as root,

                             IN REPLY TO NETSCAPE
   Netscape announced that they are going to "fix" the problem. In
   traditional Internet style, I will respond to their post.
With this knowledge, an experienced computer programmer could decrypt
messages sent by Netscape Navigator to other computers in a few hours
of computation time.
   "a few hours"? Ian and David's program generates keys in 25 seconds.
The random information is found through a variety of functions
that look into a user's machine for information about how many
processes are running, process ID numbers, the current time in
microseconds, etc.
   Specifically, the Parent Process ID, the Process ID, and the time in
   microseconds. See the exploit code for more details.
The current vulnerability exists because the size of random input is
less than the size of the subsequent keys.
   The vulnerability exists because the random input isn't random. Since
   when is the time "random"? I'm sure a few physicists would love to see
   your theories on that one. (Berkeley Standard Time notwithstanding)
Once this improvement is made, protection of the random information
will be as strong as the rest of the security built into Netscape
   That's not saying much, considering that the security community has
   not had a chance to independently verify the security in Netscape
   Navigator.
Netscape has also begun to engage an external group of world-class
security experts who will review our solution to this problem before
it is sent to customers.
   So after someone violates Netscape Navigator's security do they decide
   to have an external group verify their code. (Note that they still
   don't plan on making it available for the security community at large
   to review). According to RSADSI's Jim Bidzos, his company offered to
   review Netscape's security when it was first introduced, but Netscape
   declined. "They're asking us to review it this time," he said.
This discovery does not affect the strength or security of SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer), RC4, or any other portions of our security
   True, but this implies that SSL is a secure protocol, which has been
   shown to be false.
   At the beginning of their release:
Netscape secure software has been in use for almost a year on the
Internet by millions of customers and no thefts of actual customer
information protected by our security have been reported - this
posting on the Internet reported a potential vulnerability, not the actual theft of customer information.
   Yes, Netscape is very lucky that Ian and David are students, and not     criminals. I sincerely hope that the next time someone finds a hole in
   Netscape that it's someone who would rather win a free T-shirt than     steal lots of money.

Sept. 20, 1995
For Immediate Release

COMMUNITY CONNEXION CORRECTS INACCURACIES IN NETSCAPE PRESS RELEASE
In response to Ian Goldberg and David Wagner's recent cryptanalysis
and defeat of Netscape Navigator's security, Netscape Communications
Corporation has recently issued a press release describing the work
Ian and David had done, announced a fix, and offered comments on what
they felt were the implications on the security of their software.
Community ConneXion congratulated Netscape Communications Corporation
today for their quick response to this security problem. The fact that
they responded to the problem within two days of its publication
reflects well upon their responsiveness to the internet community,
said Sameer Parekh, Community ConneXion founder.
Sameer noted, however, that their release contained a number of
inaccuracies. He wrote a document detailing the inaccuracies that he
found, available via the World-Wide-Web at
He noted that they overestimated the time necessary to exploit the bug
by roughly two orders of magnitude. The description of the bug was
also flawed, said Sameer. Finally, he described how the solution
Netscape was presenting to the problem was viewed by many members of
the internet security community as only a partial fix.
"Millions of customers and their sensitive information are at
stake. Had Ian and Dave been criminals rather than honest students,
they might have taken this opportunity to steal credit card numbers,
snoop on people's financial transactions, and possibly more."
"Are we going to take the chance that the next person who finds a
Netscape bug may be someone who would rather steal lots of money than
win some T-shirt?" asked Sameer, referring to the T-shirt promotion
his company has developed, offering free T-shirts to people who have
found holes in Netscape security software.

Proposal for action:
1) Reverse-engineer a server to see if the keygen phase uses
a weak RNG seed. -- if so, determine the exact algorithim.
2) Organize a net-wide search over the space of the RNG seed to crack the private key of some well known secure server.
3) Release the private key to the net.

bugs in Netscape, and there probably will be more bugs uncovered

new 2.0 is doing encrypted email, probably with a really nice

that is at Verisign. This becomes a large problem I think if the en
rypted email that Netscape does requires personal x509 certificates (I
read that Versign is issuing those for $9/each.) This is a problem
because for one thing I don't think Versign will want to issue certs
to psudonyms, and Netscape may not talk encrypted email to
non-certified people. (I am not sure)

finally willing to let some of the code be available for public

allow for alternate cert hierarchies..

COMMUNITY CONNEXION TO OFFER REWARD FOR HACKING MICROSOFT
Sept. 29 1995 - Community ConneXion, an Internet Privacy Provider in
Berkeley, CA, announced today that it will be providing awards to
people who find and publicize security holes in Microsoft
"Microsoft claims to be promoting secure transactions on the net,"
said Sameer Parekh, founder of Community ConneXion, "We will prove
them wrong." Microsoft has been quoted making disparaging comments
about their competitor Netscape's product, Netscape Navigator.
Community ConneXion has also been offering a reward to expose holes in
Netscape's products. "We target widely used programs," said Parekh.
Parekh expects that many bugs and flaws in Microsoft's security
software will be found.
People want to use the Internet to do business. They want to be able
to buy things, manage their finances, and communicate privately from
the comfort of their home computer. Without a secure infrastructure
none of this is possible.
Information about the Hack Microsoft promotion is available from
  People who have found security holes
and have written exploits are directed to send mail to
hackmsoft at c2.org.
Community ConneXion is the premier provider of privacy on the
Internet. They provide anonymous email accounts and support the

COMMUNITY CONNEXION, INC. RESPONDS TO THE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER
Berkeley, CA - In an open letter sent to the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
Community ConneXion, Inc., the Internet Privacy Provider, explicitly
stated its refusal to agree to their request to restrict access to
services based on the content of the web pages their customers may
implement using Community ConneXion services.
In a letter to Community ConneXion dated February 6th, the Simon
Wiesenthal Center requested that they refuse to carry messages that
"promote racism, anti-Semitism, mayhem and violence." Their target in
the request was not Usenet, the discussion forums on the Internet
which were recently targeted for censorship by CompuServe, but the

Efforts are growing to regulate content on the Internet and restrict
freedom of expression. Community ConneXion, Inc. is opposed to all
forms of censorship. In his response to the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
Sameer Parekh, President of Community ConneXion, issued a statement in
reply to the Center's request that Internet providers pledge to
restrict service, "Community ConneXion, Inc. considers it our civic
duty to provide Internet access, services, and privacy to any
individual or group, no matter what their political or social agenda."
The Simon Wiesenthal Center is asking Internet providers to restrict
access to individuals and groups who would use their services to
promote hateful ideas. "The answer to hateful speech is more speech,"
said Parekh, "Rather than attempting to ban hateful speech, which does
nothing to prevent the hate and the effects of hate in the long run,
human rights groups should devote their time and energies towards
positive activities, such as speaking out debunking the hate groups
and holocaust revisionists. Only by speaking out against the
hate-mongers can any progress be made. Trying to stop them from
speaking will only serve to encourage them."
The very same services that Community ConneXion refuses to censor may
be used by the persecuted groups who are harassed by the anti-Semites
and neo-Nazis to aid them to protect themselves from
persecution. "Using our services someone who may be afraid of the
neo-Nazis, perhaps because they live in a very intolerant town, may
set up web pages speaking out against the anti-Semites, but not reveal
their real name or address. In this way people can provide information
and speak out against the hate without fearing any repercussions. The

will only describe a few of them in order to explain our
decision. First, the best way to fight speech is with more
speech. Second, it violates the fundamentals upon this country was
founded, in particular the ideal of freedom of expression. Finally, we
believe that trying to restrict harmful speech, which, for example,
"conspires against democracy," does more damage to the cause of
democracy than allowing the hateful individuals and organizations to
speak in the first place.
organization objects, it is more productive to speak out against the
hate and the lies of the anti-Semites and neo-Nazis than to try to
prevent them from speaking. By preventing them from speaking, you are
giving them more allies, and more legitimacy than they would have if
you merely spoke out against them and debunked their words. If you
actually take proactive action towards debunking their lies, people
will understand that they are actually lying. By preventing them from
speaking, you are promoting the idea that they actually might have
something valuable to say.  Hateful action, of course, should be
prosecuted to the fullest extent permissible by law.

the first one on the list of the Bill of Rights. Restricting access to
freedom of expression to only people with acceptable viewpoints is not
true freedom of expression.
ostensibly protect democracy does more to damage democracy than to
help it. Censorship leads towards a more restrictive society, one
which grows ever more similar to the totalitarian government of the
Third Reich, which made the atrocities of the Holocaust possible. In
order to prevent such an atrocity from happening again, no government
must be allowed to gain the power over its citizens that was allowed
the Third Reich. By asking for restrictions on speech you are asking
for a return to the controls which gave the Third Reich its power.

on the provision of services to those with unpopular viewpoints
The Internet is an unprecedented technological tool which for the
first time in history has democratized communications throughout the
world. It provides tens of millions of people with the tools to
communicate freely and share their ideas to an audience whose size and
diversity was previously unimagined. It is the embodiment of the
concept of an international marketplace of ideas.
As such it deserves to be encouraged and protected from those who
would restrict it. There are those who would limit the use of this
incredible power only to those with popular views. Community
ConneXion, Inc. has a First Amendment right and a moral obligation to
provide groups of all viewpoints with the ability to express their
viewpoints in an unintrusive, non-harassing manner on the Internet.
Given the unprecedented potential and scope of the Internet, Community
ConneXion, Inc. considers it our civic duty to provide Internet
access, services, and privacy to any individual or group, no matter
what their political or social agenda.

 COMMUNITY CONNEXION ANNOUNCES PROMOTION FOR UNCENSORED ACCESS TO THE
Berkeley, CA - In response to recent restrictions on Usenet material
made available to CompuServe customers, Community ConneXion, an
Internet privacy provider, today announced that has begun a promotion
to offer uncensored access to Usenet newsgroups at a discount to users
who have experienced censorship at the hands of their Internet service
provider, employer, or university.
"'The Internet views censorship as damage, and routes around
it,'" said Community ConneXion President Sameer Parekh, quoting
a famous saying on the net, "While a network provider, university,
or employer may want to limit the access their customers, students, or
employees may have to potentially controversial material on the
Internet, people need to realize that it is still possible for them to
access controversial material through alternative means. We're
making available services to make this fact obvious."
Community ConneXion offers full Internet access to its customers, with
no content-based restrictions on materials its customers may read or
make available on the Internet.  Community ConneXion has made
available one free month of service to users signing up for services
with Community ConneXion who are doing so in order to avoid content-
based restrictions instituted by their net provider, university, or
Customers who would like to take advantage of Community ConneXion's
uncensored access may continue to use their current provider for their
basic access, but to access the previously-unavailable materials they
may proxy through to the Community ConneXion servers. Parekh commented
on the ease with which people can bypass censorship instituted by
their provider or employer, "Providers, employers, and universities
may think that they are restricting access through their sites, but
given the ease with which people can set up an account with us, the
organizations trying to restrict access will soon realize that
censorship is hopeless."
Community ConneXion, founded in June of 1994, is the leading provider

For Immediate Release - May 9, 1996

Berkeley, CA - Community ConneXion, Inc., today announced that it will
for a limited time offer free Usenet access to anyone in France.
The announcement comes in the wake of the arrest of two managers for
French Internet service providers. The two managers at WorldNet and
FranceNet are being held responsible for the pornographic material
distributed on the "alt.binaries" newsgroups. They face up to three
years in jail.
In response to these arrests, the Association of French Internet
Professionals (AFPI) has called for a complete blackout of French
newsgroups and many providers in France have cut off news service
entirely. Community ConneXion, Inc., has announced free Usenet access
to the French in response to the resulting blackout.
"'The Internet views censorship as damage, and routes around it,'"
said Community ConneXion President Sameer Parekh, quoting a famous
saying on the net, "The Internet transcends national boundaries. This
promotion makes that fact obvious."
Community ConneXion offers full Internet access to its customers, with
no content-based restrictions on materials its customers may read or
make available on the Internet.
During this limited time promotion, people connected to the Internet
in France may access a full uncensored Usenet feed merely by pointing
their newsreaders at news.c2.net. People in other countries may also
get access to a full uncensored Usenet feed by purchasing service from

For Immediate Release - May 24, 1996
Contact: Sameer Parekh 510-601-9777x3
BERKELEY, CA - Community ConneXion, Inc., The Internet Privacy
Provider, announced today the worldwide Beta release of the
"Anonymizer" service for the World-Wide-Web.
The Anonymizer allows people browsing the web to be completely
anonymous when making web transactions.  It protects people from
having the sites they visit discover their email address, hostname,
type of computer, and other potentially sensitive information.
"The Anonymizer finally brings Caller-ID-Block to the Internet," said
Justin Boyan, who designed and implemented the system.  "If you don't
want records of your activities being kept by every web site you
visit, you should definitely be using this service."
Community ConneXion ("C2") is glad to be able to provide such a
service to the Internet community free of charge.  C2's President,
Sameer Parekh, commented on the availability of this service, "We feel
that people's privacy is too important to make people pay directly for
basic privacy services.  Therefore, we've built The Anonymizer with a
model that will allow people on the Internet to use the basic level of
service at no charge."
Future enhancements to the system include support for Netscape's
Secure Sockets Layer, which will provide web surfers with the ability
not only to hide their identity from the remote site, but to hide the
identity of the sites they are browsing from their employer,
university, or ISP.  The threat of a university clamping down on the
ability of its students to browse the web freely is very strong, and
C2 plans to make this service available in order to protect against
such threats.
The Anonymizer can be accessed at   Users
need only click on "BEGIN SURFING ANONYMOUSLY" and then choose a site
to visit anonymously.  All their web transactions from that point on
are anonymized. As the service is only in Beta phase at this point,
users may experience slow connections or downtime. As the service
moves to Production release, these problems will be eliminated.
Community ConneXion is the leading provider of privacy on the
Internet. They provide anonymous and pseudonymous internet access and
web pages in addition to powerful web service, virtual hosts, and web
design consultation. Information is available from their web pages at
