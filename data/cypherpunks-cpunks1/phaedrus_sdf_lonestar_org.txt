I'm making a somewhat wild assumption that you're voting in California --
as am I. As far as I can tell, Gore is going to take california, so by my
reasoning I'm free to vote with my conscience, since a vote for either
bush or gore wouldn't make a difference in this case. If you haven't
already you might want to consider that point (and do the research
yourself to back it up or disprove it -- don't take my word for it).

@_subject: CDR: More blather from the DEMS on FL 
As I understand it each county in florida uses a different balloting
system, so just because *your* ballot was easy to read does not
necessarily mean they all were.
Not knowing what county is in question or what county you are in, or
if the two counties are different whether they still manage to use the
same ballot, I'm not sure if your information  is relavent or not
(I really would like to see the questioned ballot..would it be so hard for
someone to go scan in a sample one so we could at least make an informed
judgement on such things...nah, that would make too much sense)

actually, since ballots were supposed to be postmarked two days ago,
killing you now wouldn't help (even if I were for it, which I'm not,
personally) unless something very bad were going on....

I'm fairly sure that virginia in 1996 was similar -- I voted absentee in
VA that year (being a college student at the time) and I don't recall
having to find a notary public, which, given that I was in bumfuck, west
virginia would have been a significant outing (along the lines of going to
K-mart -- and I remember all the times we did that...)

incidently both of these went up back in september 1999
The second article has links to both microsoft's response and bruce

I don't claim to know who's right, but I do have to admit that 'NSAKEY'
would be a lousy thing to actually name a covert key ;)
but then, the fbi still call's it carnivore, so....

@_subject: CDR: ADL lists anarchy symbol as racist 
Although the symbol is more often usedby Anarchists, an "A" in a circle is
also a symbol used by individuals in the white supremacist movement who
are violently anti-government because of their conspiratorial belief that
Jews control he government. The symbol can also signify that an individual
is part of the Aryan movement and disregard authority. Looks like an apt description to me -- they acknowledge that it isn't
always a hate symbol but is more often used by Anarchists

Sheeple, who don't think defensively. Even for their kids
oh, don't get me wrong, a convicted child molester moving into town, or
maybe an 'obscene' website, they'll scream about -- but they don't think
about real danger
Some years ago, in a Northern Virginia neighborhood that I lived near, a
group of theives went down the street at night and tried to open car
doors, when they found one that was unlocked they looted it. Amoung their
take were several handguns. What boggled me at the time was that if
someone was paranoid/intelligent enough to carry a gun, why weren't they
paranoid/intelligent enough to lock the damn car door at night? The answer that eluded me at the time was that intelligence and paranoia
are two different things, and paranoia without intelligence is dangerous.
And americans seem to be lacking in intelligence
This would probably have not been a decision made by the parents of the
kids in question. Most sheeple aren't that intelligent or cold-blooded.

I didn't say that the FBI, BATF or anyone else has (during the OK city
bombing or at any time) actually used such a facility as a human sheild. I
was pointing out that it was possible, that parents could easily be
shepherded into using such a facility for child care and that the
cold-bloodedness possible certainly does exist, just not in the parents of
the children (who are/were/would be ignorant of such uses of the very
convenient on site child care)
It doesn't require force
X (official/officer/etc in position of power) decides that a childcare
facility would make an excellent 'human sheild' in place Y.  X then makes
arrangements for decent child care facility, tells parents who work at Y
'Look. Your children can be near you, you can visit them at lunch time,
you can drop them off and pick them up on your way in and out of the
office respectively, and if something happens [in the normal sense -- kid
falls off monkey bars and breaks arm sort of things] you'll be right
No force necessary. Parents think they have a good deal. X thinks he has a
good deal. Kids are up shit creek if anything actually goes down.
And no, I'm not arguing this did, has or is happening. I'm not in a
position to have data on that. I'm arguing that, contrary to what you
said, it *is* a viable possibility.

Hrm. Perhaps I should rephrase -- it's not not-viable because people
aren't so cold blooded that they'd use their own children as a sheild,
because the people in question can use other people's children, instead. And thanks, running a 7 sysadmin department was quite enough for me. I
already know humans are stupid.
I'm not completely sure, however, that the difficulties of getting things
done in large organizations kills the possibility of putting child care
centers in places that are likely terrorist targets as human sheilds. It
strikes me as a rather hard thing to argue either way -- organizations
vary as much as individuals do, in my experience.
Well, I suppose if a bunch of unionized employees there wanted a daycare,
this could be the case -- I think it would be doubtful that the union
would want a daycare for human shield purposes...maybe I'm
misunderstanding you, though...
You mean, you haven't noticed that this list *is* inhabited by a bunch of
loonies. Largely because insanity is the only sane reaction to an insane
world, I suspect.
You know, other than a somewhat vague 'try running a large organization
sometime' you never did explain why it wasn't viable.
Ph.(still not saying it is or was going on, just arguing the
possibility..hmmph, I need [another] hobby or something)
