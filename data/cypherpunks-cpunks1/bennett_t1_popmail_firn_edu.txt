The popualtion might, since too many people seem to think we are the
government's workers, not vice-versa.
The FBI basically complains that the Constitution ties their hands to
enforce draconian laws.
14 year olds will look at hooters, given the chance [shock]

I wouldn't trust the government with anything.  Which suprises me that
stupid parents leave their kids in buildings that are known targets of
anti-government military groups.  Oh well.
Most americans probably don't know what Encryption is.  Most americans
think that because some half-assed monkey Senator says that some guy could
use to send around kiddie-porn without the FBI catching him, they think
that encryption is evil.
Reminds me of the gun laws.
Interesting how many americans are getting screwed without ever knowing it.
They sit on their asses, watching their stupid TV shows, believing the
regurgitated shit the media tosses them when one man blows up a building.
Sometimes I want to kick the whole goddamn country in the face.

@_subject: Queries from a Cyper-newbie? 
trying to sort out a few of the basics:
Well as long as you ask like that instead of what most newbies do, such as try and subscribe by sending "Add me to the mailing list" to the list.
It's better integrated for Mac Lusers and Windows 95ers.  It is, however, flawed in some respects.
different than 2.6.3i ?  Which is better?
2.6.3i cannot use CAST, or (who would want to , it's DES!) Triple-
DES.  It does however, can use other hashes with RSA, thanks to someone's discovery on PGP-USERS.  2.6.3i is dos native, and complex.  A shell integrates nicely, but it's still not the same.
(and vice versa?)  Using RSA keys? ONLY using RSA keys.  DSS/Diffie-Hellman support is being added to old PGP's.  RSAREF is used in PGP 5.0 .  MPILIB, Phil Zimmermann's original PGP RSA algorithm implementation is used in international versions.  It's becuase of RSA's patent stuff.
am aware that such s/w is nevertheless being used (and built) abroad.  My queries:  Is purely domestic use being threatened by the pending legislation?  Is it already illegal to send an encrypted msg out of the US? If so, is it illegal to receive an encrypted msg from outside the US?
Unless it is the "shitty 40 bit" type.  It can be built abroad, for example, IDEA was made in switzerland, or something like that..., PGP 2.6.3i was made legally, I think.  Domestic use is being threatened by Nazi Motherfuckers like Billy-Bob Clinton [spit], The FBI, and the NSA.  Oppose them.  Go to  and do some of the stuff there.  Sending and recieving mail from the outside of the US *is scheme to secure domestic financial transactions (such as credit cards). How "un-encryptable" is this? I read some recent postings here re difficulty of breaking 128 bit keys -- but this had reference to stronger methods of encryption than MS Explorer uses, right? So 128 bits is hard to break (umptyump years, terrawatts, etc.)? Then why does my PGP 5.0 software offer keys that are 768, 1024, etc. up to 4096 bits in length? Are these numbers on the same scale? Unencryptable?  What the fuck are you talking about?  If you mean crackable, let's just say it'd take several time the age of the Universe to crack it.  The RSA keys are weaker than symmetric cyphers, unless we're talking about DSS/Diffie-Hellman keys with 4096bits.  They are not on the same scale.
there some layman-understandable difference between these? Well, RSA's are patented and RSA is really anal with their patents.  DSS/Diffie-Hellman keys are unpatented.  You can change hashes on RSA keys (RIPEM160, MD5 [was broken already], and SHA-1).  But to use those RSA's with older PGP's, use only MD5.
to detect encrypted traffic?
It can be detected that you're using encryption.  Breaking PGP is another thing.
If any other cypherpunks want to correct me here, do so.

If these parents DID care, then why in the hell WOULD they put them in a
federal building?  If I remember fully a past post (i forget which, and
my memory ISN'T perfect) that place (the building) had been threatened
by numerous attacks, and yet these ignorant parents put their kids in
there.  I would put my kid a regular day care.  If someone blew up a
regular daycare, then they ARE fucked up.  He wasn't attacking a DAY
CARE, his midn was on blowing up the federals in there.  I'm not
JUSTIFYING killing children.  Who knows whether or not it will be
beneficial to the anti-federal cause.  Geiger gave a few examples.  To
accomplish some things you gotta break a few eggs (Tim May's post).  Not
that it's right to do it, but things happen.

I am getting sick of the crap in congress.  May's right, whenever they
want to get what they want, they just blurt out that their opposition
may support kiddie porn.  The only somewhat good measure coming up is
SAFE, but that will most likely be struck down by lawmakers.  After all,
it helps encryption, and that might aid kiddie porn!  Seriously, if the
citizens ever have a civil war, and we win, then Clinton, the senators
opposed to Pro-CODE, and other anti-crypto types should be on trial for
abuse of power, violation of citizens' rights, and high crimes against
the constitution.  I hope it would be public :-)

Alrighty, see that little key on your keyboard that says "Delete?"  I

I think people need to learn that if you don't like it, don't watch it.
Out of sight, out of mind.
That McCain with his little "Secure Public Networks Act."  That was the
best example that CONgress just doesn't give a rat's arse about us.
They trigger the "nay" key whenever someone says those magic little
words: Child Pornongraphy.  About .02% of America trades kiddie porn,
and I bet half of them don't even use PGP.  But then again,
congresscritters don't know shit about technology.

@_subject: New PGP signatures 
Well, I still use my RSA key for all signings and encryptions since
about 85% of PGP users don't use the new Diffie-Hellman keys, and some
asshole forgot to make PGP 5.0 freeware RSA key-generating.  Luckily I
can still use my RSA key.  Plus, some assholes didn't take into account
that not everyone uses Windoze95/NT 4.0 or Macintrash, and didn't make
one yet for Unix or OS/2 or DOS or Windoze 3.1 users.  My friend still
uses 3.1 and I have to use my RSA key to talk to him.
I hope you guys with the international PGP get to use 5.0 soon.  It's
really nice, all things about it excluded.
