Functional code isn't secure. Correct code doesn't exist.*
This probably means that the code does not check for buffer overflows and
other bad programming, or that it has not been audited for security
* except as a platonic ideal

One of the ways to mitigate this risk is to set up your remailer in
middleman mode (at least in 2.9beta23). To quote from the installer:      Mixmaster can be installed in the low-maintenance      `middleman' mode. In that mode, it will send mail to      other remailers only, to avoid complaints about      anonymous messages.
Obviously this isn't a perfect solution, but it helps somewhat. It's what
I'm planning on doing until I can familiarize myself with the legal
ramifications of running an "open" remailer.

An individual can simply fabricate an e-mail outright (requesting the help
file to provide himself with an easily-modified template and log entries
on on the mail relayy) or just not even show it. "Umm...Like I got this
death threat... but I deleted it" would be sufficient for some of the more
spineless providers.
It seems as though if you're running as a middleman and you encounter a
plaintext message, it'll encrypt the message with the next remailer's key
before it mails it out. But I only took a quick look at the code.

Yes, you do need at least one, but perhaps you _only_ need one. Check out
the story in EETimes at  People seldom read the errata for books. * Page 157: The section on "Thermodynamic Limitations" is not quite
correct. It requires kT energy to set or clear a single bit because these
are irreversible operations. However, complementing a bit is reversible
and hence has no minimum required energy. It turns out that it is
theoretically possible to do any computation in a reversible manner except
for copying out the answer. At this theoretical level, energy requirements
for exhaustive cryptanalysis are therefore linear in the key length, not
