The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas Providing 0pp0rtunity for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled by major oil companies in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e reserves, estimated at over 3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065
The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.
What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or s|ight|y, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
