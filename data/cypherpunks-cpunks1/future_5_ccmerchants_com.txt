The Hazelwoods Welcome You to Caruba International Partnership!
Education ~ Privacy ~ Protection ~ Profit
VISIT: OBJECTIVE: The objective of Caruba International is to teach people all over the world how to manage their assets, build wealth and secure a strong financial future. Not only does Caruba teach you how, it also gives you the tools. Each partner can determine their own level of wealth based on their LOCATION: We are located on the island of Aruba, which is a small island nation in the Caribbean, 15 miles off the northern coast of Venezuela. Aruba is an extremely stable country, which received its independence from Holland in 1986. Our main bank in Aruba is one of the top 6 in the world. This is not a U.S. based company operating offshore, Caruba International was formed exclusively in Aruba.
EDUCATION: I just returned from Caruba's first Tradewinds Educational Summit in Aruba. I am no longer convinced that Disneyland is the happiest place on earth. So many wonderful lighthearted people make Aruba a delightful place to visit. While there, I toured the desert like interior and several other natural and historic attractions. But the main reason I went was to investigate the Caruba business opportunity. I spoke with the founders, Ivan Shew-A-Tjon, the President, is native to Aruba, educated in the U.S. and has traveled worldwide for the financial and investment industry. His expertise and global contacts make him the perfect person to oversee Caruba's investment portfolio. And Damon Westmoreland, Executive Vice President, who resides in San Diego, CA and has owned and operated several successful networking companies, which made him a millionaire by the age of 25. HeÂs responsible for the compensation plan, website and marketing the Caruba Partnership. The conference was well rounded, giving me the confidence I needed to invest and also recommend this opportunity to you. The conference included how the company was founded, what the objectives are and how they intend to reach those objectives. The partner compensation plan was explained in more detail, currently we have a little over 3,000 active partners. We heard from an estate planning tax attorney who shared some better ways to transfer assets during your lifetime and at death to avoid taxes. There was a very interesting presentation on peak performance discussing how exercise and nutrition helps athletes and business people reach their maximum potential. This special program has been created through many years of scientific research with top athletes and business people.
PRIVACY: People talk about the invasion of privacy, but I think this is really a misnomer, especially in the U.S. How can you have an invasion of privacy when you don't have any privacy to begin with. They know what you eat, drink, drive and buy, where you go and where you sleep. Every financial transaction is recorded and scrutinized by your government. Creditors, lenders, vendors, neighbors can all gain access to your records, so how can you keep anything private? By going offshore to a place called Aruba and becoming an anonymous partner in Caruba International. Your account remains private, your wealth accumulates secretly, far from the prying eyes of others.
If you have watched 60 Minutes often, then you know what can happen to you. Property sized, frivolous lawsuits, garnishments, liens against your property by creditors and/or your government. Many times it can be totally unjustified, and you're ruined just trying to defend yourself. Even though my family has Toll Free access to the best law firms in North America for $25 per month (See  for details), until now my assets were all invested in the good old U.S.A. I'm not saying you can't find good investments in your country and many have, but it's hard to protect those assets in the event someone makes a claim against them. It makes a lot of sense to me to move some money offshore for protection and to take advantage of the greater global opportunities you don't have access to from home. Especially when a vehicle has been created for middle income individuals to participate in. Until now, only the very wealthy have been able to protect and grow their assets offshore.
Here in the U.S. and many other countries there are all kinds of regulations that cut into your earning potential compared to some other places on earth. Caruba Partners have two ways to make money privately.
1) The Partnership Investment Fund - As a partner you can invest any amount at any time into our privately managed global investment pool. Earnings from this pool are added to your private partner account monthly.
2) Referring New Partners - Caruba will pay you for bringing in new partners. This is the Network Marketing aspect of the partnership and is totally optional. See  for more details on this option.
OUR INVITATION TO YOU:
Gloria and I want to extend our personal invitation to you to become a Caruba Partner. We are here to help you in any way we can. As a partner you can have your own High-Tech Flash Website to present the Caruba opportunity worldwide 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This website provides on-line sign-up for interested parties and will automatically credit your on-line account for each new partner. And since the compensation plan rewards you for the efforts of others you refer, you can build a large residual income for the future.
We want to wish you the most success possible!
