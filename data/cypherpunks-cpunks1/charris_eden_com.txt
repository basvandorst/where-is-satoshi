FYI  - AT&T Wireless had announced they would begin passing through CLID information on cellular phones in the Austin, Texas area
effective June 15, 1996.  I don't know how this affects ANI or what
other areas are doing, but I wouldn't  assume your cellular phone # is
not being passed through.

However, there does appear to be a 1993 edition of the
book.  Perhaps this is what Mr. Schneier was I happened to be at Borders bookstore in Austin
this afternoon and checked.  They don't have it
but will special order it.
