@_subject: mediated capital spectacular enemy 
Thee InterNet is not a collection of machines, but a social
relation among people, *mediated* by nothing.
Thee InterNet is *capital* to such a degree of accumulation
that it becomes a machine.
Thee InterNet which eliminates all geographical distance reproduces distance internally as *spectacular* separation.
InterNet theory is now the *enemy* of all InterNet ideology
and knows it.
