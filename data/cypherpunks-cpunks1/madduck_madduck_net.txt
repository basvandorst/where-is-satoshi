A curious idea that I've been paying some attention to for a while.
One could simply implement a means that tries to connect with IPsec
by default and falls back to IP if unsuccessful (keeping a cache of
IPsec incapable hosts). The main problem here, of course,  the
required public key repository, if you don't want to
have your keys in DNS records. And also, the expensive SA
negotiation and the potential for DoS.

Not at all, I just never came across this discussion. I have pretty
strong filters on cypherpunks, letting through only new threads and
replies to threads that interest me. Now Choate is also a reason to
delete a new thread.
I kinda knew the answer before I posted...

Did I miss some development or why exactly does cypherpunks care
about a release candidate of libevent (or Wolfram's New Kind of
Science for that matter)? Was I frozen for that long?
Note that I am not trying to be a bitch or troll, but I am on this
