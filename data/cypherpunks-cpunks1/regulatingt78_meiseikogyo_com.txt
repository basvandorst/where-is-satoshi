off to the kindergarten valentines day party
she is my best babysitter for cate she takes turns with me putting cate to bed and being her pillow and then suddenly and to my surprise i met and married the man i had no idea i was dreaming of but he was perfect for me and better than anything i had imagined or sought after before
i never thought life would then take me to utah to attend byu and then off to serve as a missionary for a year and a half but it did and it was hardest most surprising most rewarding experience of my life
valentines day preparations
1 luce 2 Untitled 3 Working 4 Stove Top
i have been laying in bed sick since monday it seems to be getting worse by the day not better i am so irritated and antsy i miss my family and i want to clean my house from anthro
it made me happy
she didnt want to print off her name- signing was a must
i got a lot emails about what i eat and how it effects pcos- so i hope you dont mind if i just answer all the questions here instead of going through each email
and that made me think of all the insomniatic nights that she stayed up with me and mirrored my every move and snuggled me right out of my anxiety into dreamland long after grant and cate had drifted off
i spent a few hours organizing my yarn and needles into that armoire hey my little family
ok its hard to stop i love every song
confession  i miss saved by the bell
the girl loves a project i mean LOVES it was like so fun to her to print them off plan how she wanted to present them go to the store for candy sign and put them together she just bossed me around and made sure i tied the string right i swear nothing makes me happier than a peaceful space and some needles Quilt kits finally all done
where are neighborhoods like that anymore with bushes big enough to hide in and kids that go around the block together all afternoon and normal sized houses and the old winkfields next door ok i dont need the winkfields but id sure love to give my kids the rest
