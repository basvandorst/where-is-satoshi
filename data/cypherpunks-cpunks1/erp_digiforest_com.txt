@_subject: Unix User Password File Encryption 
Ok, I realize that you cannot reverse the encryption process for a Unix
password..  But --  Explain to me why the following wouldn't work.  And if
it could work, I am willing to do the algorithms and math for this...  I'm
no good at coding and such..  But I can do algorithms and a lot of math
easily enough *shrug*....  And if anybody uses this idea ---  Please give
me credit for the idea..  If it has already been tried --  Can someone
please refer me to where it was tried, adn if there are any texts on it..
I would like to read them..  Thanks ok here it is:
Normal Programs for Cracking a Unix password file, such as CrackerJack
take a word, use the salt in the password file for that password, encrypt
the word using that salt, and then compare what it comes out as.  If it
isn't the same, it moves on to the next word.   My idea is similar to
this, but is a bit different.
Basically it would take a beginning word and encrypt it with the same salt
as used on the password in the passwd file.  So let us say that for an
example our salt is aa, our outcome encrypted password is X8mfjs53D ...
Ok now let us say that we take this salt of aa and run through the
following into it and getting these patterns from it (these aren't the
true patterns etc, I'm just making htese things up, but would it be
possible?)  salt aa  --  inputed password  0001  --  outcome encryption  Zkdrj234S
salt aa  --  inputed password  0002  --  outcome encryption  Rksjr342s
salt aa  --  inputed password  0003  --  outcome encryption  25Svj43zY
(For the following process we'd obviously use mor ethan three, we would
probalby use a thousand at least, nad have them be all sizes of passwords
and combiantions..  like aaaab or abababababab and so on...)
Compare the outcomed encryptions --  And find a pattern in them..  Now in
the above I'm just going to say like it comes out as 8x + 4/y - SQ(2z) + 4a = encrypted password..  Where xyza are each of the
characters respectively such as   0000                                   xyza  based on a 255 or however many
ascii char system..  I know this is completely wrong for what I've done
here, but I'm not doing the math or anything right now, I'm just making it
up as I go for an example...  Now say that since we have found the
pattern...  We take the outcome --  Do the algebra to figure out what the
xyza would be..  And ther eya go woopity doo there is the password..
Not as simple as I've said here of course..  It would be a lot more
complex..  But that is the basic idea...   What is wrong with this idea?

**what I said deleted**
But But But *laugh* ---  Ok, here is my only straw in this lousy bushel of
confusion >) ---  What about a Fuzzy Pattern?  ----  Ya I know, that is a
pretty big staw...  The thought of it is fuzzy, let alone a fuzzy pattern.
I've done a lot of reading on Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic in general..  I
see how it could work 'maybe' But, yes it is a very indefinite field..  To
many people don't believe in its possible existance...
Ok --  Any replys would be nice thanks bye.

@_subject: 56 kbps modems 
I personally, am not much for this, I am just one with various ideas, and questiosn and such, so here goes.
Ok, I agree with those.
Personally, by saying that no transmission on a standard phoneline can have more than 3100 baud, is a statement saying that technology and science, shall never advance, to a point where things are possible.
If you remember right, just 10 or so years ago, we stated that 2400 baud was the highest possible baud, and we would never go over.  My modem, running on a standard phone line, is a 28.8 USRobotics modem, with the software, and hardware upgrades to a 3400 baud, I get on an average day anywhere from 3500 to 3600 baud for send/receive.  On a bad day, I only get 3100 to 3200.  SO I would say, that my phone lines, are cleaner than most eh?  And Yes, I am in the US.
Speaking of ISDN, how many people, can afford to have a personal ISDN line in there house?  And then afford to connect to something/someone else on a next to permanent basis monthly?
What about new ways of splitting the steps and baud more so that it shows less at a higher level....  Just a question..  Ahh well, I'm getting a page so I shall finish this now...  Answer appreciated..

@_subject: Public Schools 
First off, what does this have to do with cryptography?  or anything cypher for that matter?
So, basically your saying, since my parents cannot afford to pay for a private school for me, we are genetically inferior to those who can?
Because hate tell ya, but I've ran into some major idiots that go to private schools.  Also to consider that from the school I go to, last year we had two perfect sat scores (no problems missed).
I am assuming from what you have said in that statement, that you believe since he may have gone to a public school, it has made him have the opinion he does?
Also, in your statement that your older kid goes to a private school, and that the parents are obviously genetically superior to public school parents.  You seem to be saying that YOU are genetically superior to my Another thing to consider here is, from this line of statements, you are saying that children who have parents who made it well in, let us say the movie buisness (or even drug buisness), and then send there children to public schools, are genetically superior because they can act (lie) better than my parents.  For if this is so, that must mean that my aunt is genetically superior to my mother (who is a teacher at a private school, but she did not go to a private school) and to her parents, for she is making more money, and if she ever has children they will be genetically superior to me, because they will have more money?
Just wanting this cleared up please..  It kind of confuses poor little 'ol me who is jsut a lousy senior in a public school (and scored 1560 on my SAT, as if that means anything, just means I have a good memory), since from what you say I must be stupid, because my parents only make 50 to 60k$ per year between the two of them (My father being an AutoCad Design Consultant, and my Mother a LD (Learning disabled) Teacher at a public school)?
True, but also depends on where you are at.  Some states have cheaper taxes (Nevada for instance), compared to others.
Umm, where you not the one that started this conversation?
Darwin and (that other guy, name just slipped my mind, must be those genetically inferior genes of mine)?
Hate to inform you on this but, it is more often than not the children sent by there rich mama and papa to school, that end up on drugs or as drug dealers, than the ones that start out with scholarships (For the ones with scholarships have more to loose, than the ones with the rich mama and papa, for the rich mama and papa can afford the big expensive lawyer.).  Just look at the studies and such done on this type of area.  Also you have to consider that generally the ones that end up as drug dealers, are the children who have parents that where drug dealers and such or had experience in such, or just had parents who didn't care what they did.
Ok, now back to something crypto related ok?  Though I am rather interested in this subject.
Boy oh boy, someone has a opssibly inferiority complex here...

even think about going there..  Let alone to include how well he'll have
to do on his interviews etc..  Also you may wish to have him look again at
what he wants to be before he goes to some major college such as MIT,
because tuition at MIT costs approx 100,000$/4 years.  Personally that is
a hell of a lot, but then again *shrug*...  I recommend going to a local
small college, get his associates, see if that is what he still wants to
do, then go on from there.  I know many people that started in Computer
Science and died after the first year.  Now colleges that are good for Computer Sc ience..  I have heard that RIT
is good..  but I'm nto sure on that..  I know pretty well positive that
MIT is excellent, but when you get down to the basics MIT is more of an
engineering school than a science/philosophical school which Computer
Sciences falls under..  Another good school from what I've heard is UCLA..
then again you can discredit anything I've said, because I'm still a
HighSchool senior myself and have been looking into Computer Criminology
for the last three years, and I'm positive it is what i want so *shrug*..

Hmm....  Then a have a lieing blah blah blah of a counselor >)  hehe  I
applied for MIT, and even had an interview..  Then dropped my application
after getting chewed out by my counselor, and having had her refuse to
fill out anything on my second part of the application that said
specifically "COUNSELOR ONLY"  went to the principal and he refused..
Filled it out myself, and since it didn't have the counselors signature ...
I dropped it aka they dropped me but its easier to say it hteo ther way
around.  And yes I understand the well-rounded thing..  But then again you
hav eto consider that the average student at MIT has applied at least two
times.  I know that one for a fact from some program or something I read
that MIT puts out.
True, it is one of the best, can't argue against that..  But there are
others that are better in certain areas..  from my knowledge MIT expresses
more in its engineering departments than anything else though..  Although
I do know a very philosophical physics professor there so *shrug*..  maybe
I'll apply again some day..  And yes all the rest of my requirements wher
ehigh..  I am a swimteam captain, first trombone in my school, for
marching jazz pep and symphonic bands..  I'm also the lead french horn..
Then I have the little side things such as Chess team captain..  and have
tha precious 3.6 GPA the only proglem with it is I ahve one teacher that
gave me a D in my freshman year, so I can't get into honor society ..  go
figure...  But hey such is life..  I'm planning on reapplying after I get
into college and raise myself back to a 4 point so who knows what will
Really good yes..  Not necessarily the best though..   Check everywhere..
each aspect of every college may have one thing that he is specifically
interested in that would be better than going to MIT or some other such
place3...  *nod*  I do agree with that...  THey are pretty much the same now..
I havet o ask, did you make it in on your first apply to it?
and please forgive the mistypes in this..  I'm really lagged for some
reason..  And well, It takes forever to go back when it is lagged this
bd, so I ahven't can back and changed things automatically like I usually
