Here in Philippines, the government tax for connecting to the Internet, the percentage is 10%.
Forwarded message:
Somebody needs to do their homework. Austin, TX has been taxing ISP's
for at least a year now. A recent Internet Provider meeting on this
issue resulted in a return to ISP's of a goodly amound of their taxes
because of various issues (read that I didn't go to meeting, I don't run an
ISP but a SOHO consultancy w/ Internet services).
I have to pay the state 8.25% interest on any funds my customers deliver
to me.

Does anyone have any ideas about this metered phone? I am from Philippines and heard some news that it will be existing in 1997. Quite a big problem! Every dial will be counted, every seconds will be measured...

@_subject: Stuffs used for detection 
In our school library, there is a depository area wherein you deposit your things and get the tag. Since the library doesn't allow those tags to be brought out from the library, everytime you brought it out and pass by the door, it will alarm. Does anyone know what stuff is that? How come it is alarmed? I brought some metals but it wouldn't alarm... Why those tag would alarm them???

Does anyone know how to Internet through radio using packet modems? By next year, our telephone company will be implementing metered phones, this will be unfair to modem users since they do that to prevent people from talking to the phone for long hours.

How can I send e-mail to post my message to the Usenet without using the NNTP server of my ISP? I say this because my ISP's news server is not working 100% correctly, if not, it is not 100% dependable.

In Iran, Chenghis Khan killed 30 millions out of 40 who previously
lived there.
Ghenghis Khan, not Chenghis Khan.
It basically proves that people now are no better and no worse than people then. Really, there is no reason for things to be otherwise.
I agree with you. Massacre done before is more worst than now. But there are a lot of moral people in those times.
