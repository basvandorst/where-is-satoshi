I don't know about anyone else but I've been waiting for someone cute on this list for a long time. That's right, the rest of you are pretty damn ugly, and the sooner you admit it the better off you'll

@_subject: the punks mentioned in The Atlantic 
"In 1992, inspired by his example, a band of mathematicians, computer scientists, and software engineers based primarily in the San Francisco area began to discuss ways to defend personal privacy in the computer age. They were brought together by an intense ideological commitment to privacy and free speech, and by an anarchistic mistrust of government and big business. They dedicated themselves to creating and widely disseminating the best cryptography possible, for all to use. They called themselves the Cypherpunks."
The article is mainly about the burgeoning privacy business, interviews with folks from Zero Knowledge and such. Link to the quote:  (about halfway down the page)

@_subject: oppose nomination of John Ashcroft 
If this is inappropriate for this list, I hope all participants will accept my apologies in advance, and let me know, and I will not post this sort of thing here again.
If any here are in opposition to the nomination of John Ashcroft to Attorney General, the following website allows citizens to sign a petition stating this: I'm not trying to get people into any arguments here.. I thought this might be appropriate since people here are concerned with civil rights. If this is inappropriate, again, my apologies.

civil voting supporting should be lukewarm Hey, don't mention it. But don't miss the other areas of his policies, like  women's rights, and such as the following: "He supports limits on free speech over the Internet. He supported  legislation, later held unconstitutional, that sought to censor  communications over the Internet. And he supported legislation to require  mandatory use of filtering on all computers used by schools and libraries  receiving federal e-rate assistance." Of course I realize that the freedom of citizens to bear arms is going to be  near and dear to many if not all participating in this list. But one has to  balance one issue against others. I feel that women's rights are especially  important in a democratic society, and I also feel that anyone who supports  the right to bear arms but also supports the removal of separation of church  and state, and the impositions against your speech over the internet to  which such a postion leads, is not worth your time. I personally would want  to find a better figure to symbolize and speak for my right to arm myself. sparkane my allowed - to

Interesting that Senor Banks signs his email Mrs.. perhaps John IS Mrs Banks..?
This demands an Onion-type headline.. Whoever comes up with the best will have my, um, undying admiration. OK, OK, and my password cracking software.

@_subject: what is up with the virus asshole 
This virus is generated by alt.comp.virus too (I think that's the correct list, haven't looked at it in a while). From what I've heard, the virus is almost impossible to get off the list as it's programmed to repost itself, and also update itself.
Is it possible that cypherpunks is on alt.comp.virus?
