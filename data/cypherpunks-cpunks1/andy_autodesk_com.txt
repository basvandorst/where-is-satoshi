Are you Jethroes still using berkeley mail? Get a real mail user
agent, like MH, and you can write a pattern that collects all the mail
sent to a given address into a mail folder, effectively making your
own digest.

@_subject: fido encryption. 
Doesn't Fidonet have a long tradition of feuding and splitting
into "subnets", which is facilitated by the way they maintain their nodelist files? An excited Fido'er expalined it to me one night at usenix
several years ago, but I had little interest in pc networking then.
Perhaps a encryption ok subset of fidonet could form? Anyone who knows
more about this care to comment?

@_subject: problems with key escrow? 
Do you accept the claim that clipper is only for telephone
conversations? I certainly don't believe that once a digital encryption
algorithm is conveniently present in my digital network (clipper would
need a digital audio hookup and modem to work with analog phone lines)
I am going to abstain from using it for all my _other_ digital traffic,
like email and data. Especially if everyone I want to talk uses this
standard too, and there is some sort of key-exchange protocol we all
use that just happens to use clipper as well. Now anyone with my
escrowed key can automatically scan all my mail, bills,
library requests, software purchases, video checkouts, database
inquires, work that I telecomute on, etc (think about all info that
flows into or out of your house!). This is considerably more that can
be done now, and at a much lower than can be done today.
I consider this to be the greatest lie in the Denning / Slick Willy
party line on clipper. Most non-computer people do not appreciate the
power of standardization to coerce users to inferior or otherwise
undesirable standards, because everyone and every machine one needs to
interoperate with follows the standard, foul though it is. (As a DOS
developer, I am quite aware of this ;-) I wish the press would figure
this out, and challenge the SW's spokespeople on this.

@_subject: Physical storage of key is the weakest link 
Excuse my ignorance of PGP, I am fairly new to using it, and thinking about
its operation and source code. Is not your secret key stored encoded by
the pass phrase, so that if the pass phrase is in your head, the secret
key on disk is useless to an attacker? Of course, while PGP is running,
after you have entered the pass phrase, the secret key is available within your machine, and could be stolen, and if your OS leaves pagefiles etc
arounnd, might even be taken after you shut down PGP.
Or am I missing something? Thanks, Andy

@_subject: Physical storage of key is the weakest link 
[good discussion of how the pass phrase is more guessable  that the secret key deleted ]
Well, because the secret key is part of a  pair,
and is thus some un-rememberable number, rather than a hash of something

@_subject: Was accurate description of movie... 
Hi, I hope no one of any race/sex/religion is so offended that
they feel driven away from this list. There is some genuinely
interesting techincal comment amongst the flames, tracts,
rants, and chatter. In the case of the informal
movie review of _True Lies_, the description is quite correct, if stated rather coarsely. Rather than hassling the reviewer, you
might like to keep his comments in mind when deciding whether to see
the movie. This said, I went to the movie with several people of
various sexes and nationalities, and they all enjoyed highly, though some felt it necessary to express formal dis-approval before laughing.

Marvin Minsky's old automata theory text
(something like "Finite and Infinite Machines") has an intro to the computable reals (or constructable reals? can't remember) which the interested might like to read.

@_subject: No SKE in Daytona and other goodies 
A technical question about the proposed SKE schemes: are they a proper superset
of non-escrowed pgp/ripem type systems (pk for key exchange/auth, private
session keys for privacy)? As a previous poster mentioned, users
could select null or locally controlled key escrow agents, and effectively
have a non-escrowed system. This would be possible only if the users one wished to communicate with did co-operate, and did somehow
exchange public keys with you in a non-escrowed fashion, right? Is this then a strong argument for the web-of-trust model?
If I am tottaly out in left field here, feel free to berate me
in private mail, and I'll post no further on this.

@_subject: Dorothy Denning 
Dr. Denning is a secure systems (OS and databases) research from SRI. Her background is in capability-based OS (her advisor was MUTICS designer Peter Denning, whom she married) and inference of private data from
statistical data bases. Her work is interesting and potentially
contributes to our privacy, but has little direct connection to
cryptanalysis. Phil's objection seems quite reasonable.
I recall a profile of the Dr's Denning in one of the
popular cracker/phreax exposes, (maybe in Markov/Hafner?)

Well, Applied Crypto is of recent (now) vintage, so
I would not expect it to show up in Project G. But certainly
some of the classic stuff that APP reprints might be candidates.
Have the copyrights expired on W. Friedman's texts, or were they
pd anyway as Army publications?

@_subject: Putting new PGP on company machines. 
Has anyone asked the company shysters about the legal status of MIT-PGP?
I'd really like to have and use pgp at work, but have hesitated about
putting it our machines here, as we are so prim and proper (in public)
about intellectual property.

For starters, does use by employees at work for routine email count
as "non-commercial"?
