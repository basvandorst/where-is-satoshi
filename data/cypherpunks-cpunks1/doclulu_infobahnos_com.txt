On Win 3.1 using Netscape 1.22, you can improve your 'lack of
output' by removing in the PREFERENCES menu: Your Name:
                                  Your Email:
                                  Your Organization:
        The bad side is that you cannot mail from Netscape without filling
the Email entry with a valid Email address and putting an anonymous address
(ex.:an123456 at anon.penet.fi) would cause
 to report your REAL hostname with your anonymous username
(ex.:an123456 at myhost.com) so if privacy is a must and you cannot use the anonymizer, this could reduce
your output to your computer type and operating system and your browser and
version number. For my part, after removing my Email, it was all that was
left (-: ( It will stay that way... )
