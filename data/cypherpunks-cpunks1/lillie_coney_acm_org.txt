@_subject: Norwegian history database password lost and retrieved 
After the password for accessing a Norwegian history museum's database
catalog for 11,000 books and manuscripts had been lost when the database's
steward died, the museum established a competition to recover it.  Joachim
Eriksson, a Swedish game company programmer, won the race to discover the
password (ladepujd, the reverse of the name of the researcher who had
created the database).  How he arrived at it was not disclosed.  [Source:
