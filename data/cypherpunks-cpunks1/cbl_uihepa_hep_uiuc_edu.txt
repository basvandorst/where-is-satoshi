@_subject: damn fine compression.... 
I'm trying to find out about the remailer, but of course the files in
soda.berkeley.edu:pub/cyperhpunks/remailer are compressed or some
such  ie :hal's.instructions.gz.   I don't have anything other
than zip and uued/decode, so could some kind person send me a clear
text of the remiler instructions?
