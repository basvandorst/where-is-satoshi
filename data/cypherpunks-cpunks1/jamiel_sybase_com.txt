One point here- you are not actually suppressing the transmission of your
phone number. It is transmitted *between switches* in any case- you are
simply suppressing the transmission from a switch to the destnation phone.
This is important in relation to the phone company recieving data, as well
as the distinct possibility that a clever person could still get this. I
got the above info out of Phrack Magazine (_Caller ID Technical Details_ by
Hyperborean Menace
 still being issued as I write this).
Don't know, but from what little I know about the phone company, I would
assume using the demand-dial numbers (like 102880) for ATT) from another
long distance phone would be a start.

Obviously it doesn't map directly, but phones can provide a good example.
people can phone-bomb people, but it gets boring. Most prank callers ger
sick of it by the time they hit highschool. There are cases of prank
callers getting scary but these are pretty few and fall between. You may
say that the difference is that I have to have to be on the phone to do
this, which doesn't apply to computers- well, I can, using a Macintosh and
phone set up a pretty good combination war dialer/recorded message to bomb
everyone in my local access range. How often does this happen? and what
would happen to me if I did this? *There's* the key. You slap people's hand
for this kinda thing. If I send a 200 meg binary file to a site once every
15 seconds for a couple of hours, I get in trouble. Easy.
People talking about the future with computers always talk about ways to
make things impossible for someone to do- this has never worked in the real
world, and won't in the virual one. You just make it not worth doing.
See above- If I mount a denial of service attack on you via phone- tell my
computer to call you once every 15 seconds, forever, how long would it take
to get the cops to pay me a visit? About as long as it took you to find a
phone that isn't tied up by me ;)

Well, I guess we concieve of the meaning of the phrase "'right' to a job"
somewhat differently. I see it as meaning everyone has the oppurtunity to
earn a living. Whether or not I have the responsibility to follow through
or not, I have that chance. (I also don't know that I think my job has
anything to do with my purpose in life- If someone can find that to be the
case, great, but otherwise it is just a way to stay alive while they are
looking for the real thing, so to speak.)
I suppose I look at the alternative- that people don't have the right to
earn a living, that doing so is a priviledge. How easy is it to get by
without a job in this country? It can be done, but it sucks.

This is something I have been  meaning  to  write  to the list
for  several  weeks,  and  this  post  is the perfect lead in.
When  I  joined  this  list,  I saw thought it was going to be
much different.  I had  assumed   1)  that people on this list
would  have  much different politics and 2) that that wouldn't
really  matter,  'cause  everyone here is  concerned with  one
issue, which we could all agree on. 2) seems to have partially
true, sometimes.
Without expounding  at lengths, my reaction was to unsubscribe
on short order  when I saw some  of  the  first  posts  flying
around. I didn't,  because  I  try to keep an open mind and do
change opinions sometimes. But not everyone who is a potential
crypto  supporter is  gonna bother, and by tying (seemingly or
not- impressions count  here) the issue to a particular set of
other beliefs, there is a huge  chance  that  others are going
to be alienated.  I know *I* don't want  to be associated with
libertarianism or (even worse) Perot...
The point is that  even if you  think anyone  with a viewpoint
opposing yours is automatically stupid and not worth your time
(and I don't think  that  too many of you are that bad off ;),
aren't they at least  worth  using  to  further  something you
believe strongly in? It  might  do  well  to  be   careful  in alienating   potential  allys  by  flip  political  jokes  and
comments.

First off, don't dismiss  me  as  a whiner.  I personally
could care less about your  personal politics until  they
overlap with crypto. But you misread my post consistently.
Perhaps I did poorly at expressing myself. I haven't been
writing due to time constraints. It is not *my* political
interests being underrepresented here that I was rambling
about. It was the potential loss of other people. Extreme
example- If you started to read a book called _Crypto for
the Masses_ by someone who rambled on for 400 pages about
socialism,  and  then  got  to  the point and made really
valid, cutting observations about  the  state  of crypto,
what are the odds you'd read to that section?
What  I  was  trying to say  was not that I feel torn between being on this  list and  my own  views, but that disregarding
what anyone here may or may not believe in, first impressions
are  gonna chase a  lot of people away who otherwise could be
sympathetic to many beliefs that seem to be held as important.
I wasn't replying to you so much as using this thread as a jump point
for (!!) a new topic, specifically that of perceptions of others Re:
this list. No, it wasn't a jab at you (I think Perot is scary as well)-
sorry if my comments lent themselves to this interpretation.
I do think, however, it would be valid  to say that  a Perot
supporter should be considered a potential  ally- as much as
a libertarian or even a Clinton supporter.
That was not my point.
I do not  blame others for anything.  The goal was  to inform
others of the perceptions of a relative newcomer  to the list
who  differs  significantly in opinion on numerous  points in
relation to a attracting newcomers to the wonderful  world of
crypto. If I thought this list didn't interest me, I wouldn't
be on it.

The point is that if we know our stuff, have way too much liesure time and
are dedicated to difficult solutions, my cellular and your cellular could
be hacked to make use of the DSP as a co/dec for what ever we wish it to.
The rebroadaster, central switcher, etc have nothing to do with it- they
don't particularly care if they are transmitting ramblings from your mother
or your voice reversed in half second snips or a Madonna song. Obviously,
analog transmission techniques make, say, a PGPPhone unworkable (even is
someone was bored enough to port it to a DSP :), but scrambling and
reassempling an analogue stream has nothing to do with the relay and could
theoretically be performed by the telephones themselves. Note that I am
making no case for this being in the least bit practical- I can think of
much better thigns to do with my time.

I was thinking some about remailers and means to create more
effective ones. I think the idea of padding messages has been
kicked around (has anyone implemented it?), but what about random
compression? Some messages are compressed, others are padded, some
are left alone, perhaps shooting for a median message size
(everything coming from this mailer tries to be 9k, or as close as
possible). Of course, this requires a standard so that other
remailers downstream can make the message readable.
Another thing that occured to me is the thought that if there were
an organized web or remailers, remailers could bounce messages
between them automatically- a header could identify the number of
bounces perhaps, I haven't thought too much about the implications
of doing so, but if every message through the web bounced around
30 times with reordering, padding/compression, PGP, etc. then
traffic analysis would be pretty damn hard, I would think, even
for someone monitoring the entire web of remailers' traffic.
This all assumes that:
- remailers can agree on a standard for the above needed features
- a semireliable web of remailers can be maintained
- some method fordealing with denial of service attacks can be
found (a coredump sent to the web could play all sorts of hell, as
could an 'evil' remailer that sneaks in and changes the
how-many-times-through identifier).
The third problem could be delat with by deciding on a size limit-
if a message is over 65k (or whatever) it is bounced- if you're
sending something big, split it.
The first one could probably be done- if someone (grin- if I find
any time soon, this is a project I'd like to do) wrote a nice
package that was easy to install and use with a feature set that
could be agreeable to most.
The second one is the problem, but could be dealt with by the
first by establishing automated communication- when someone
installs the package, send a control message another remailer
already part of the web which 'registers' it, and then the web
consistently tries to maintain itself by checking on the others
and dropping ones that go down off the list. Some sort of method
would have to be found for ones that drop off then later come
online again so that control messages didn't have to be manually
initiated every time, but that shouldn't be that hard.
What are the problems in the above?
Would Perl be a good choice for doing this?
I saw some code from a remailer some time ago, but lost my mailbox
a while back (which could also mena that this is a dry rehash of
an old discussion... apologies if I am rewriting someone elses
thoughts). Anyone still have this?
Am I talking out my ass?

information services.' He gave the partyline, 'as a provider of information
services.' When I am asked about something 'as a small magazine publisher,'
for instance (one of the few things that gets me questioned like that
:), I respond as one. No publisher is gonna let people talk about touchy
issues in an official capacity- it isn't professional and cause _tons_ of
problems for no good reason. Yes, that can be used as a lame excuse,
but there are many times it isn't. Grove, on the other hand, has no place making statements like that,

I knocked this off Cypherpunks. It has no relevance there,
although I was tempted. I'm also responding to both of you
in the same message for my convenience. Also, forgive the
spelling. For some reason my spell checker keeps bombing
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
         ^^^
First, you switched verbs on me. Semantic games are usually pretty
pointless, but here you are twisting my meaning.
Anyone who doesn't believe that the issue of drugs can be dealt with
on a societal level with rationality and respect should read up on or
take a trip to Holland (I'm talking drug policy here, not economics or
anything else).
If you want to talk crack-babies, I'd ask you what are the causes of
the situation: some depraved, subhuman need for the drug or an economic
and social environment that rapes most people in living it of their self-
respect and dignity (I don't see being raised in a U.S. ghetto as being
all that far removed from being raised in a totalitarian state, but this
is a different conversation topic, and I won't get too into it here).
"Gosh, Batman, how can we begin to deal with the root of this issue?"
"Well, we have two choices. We can assume that the drug user is a
depraved, subhuman beast that deserves to suffer and be incarcerated
(and maybe spit on, too), or we can try to find a way to either help
them out of a nasty situation, or at least not make their plight any
worse than it already is."
And we are making it worse, as a nation. As others have noted, legalization
would cause prices to fall significantly (less drug related theft), end
most related violence (as a smoker, I've never even been *tempted* to
mug someone for a butt ;), and probably have significantly better quality,
thereby alleviating many of the drug-related health concerns.
                                              ^^^^^^^
If you have this take, look at DCF's comments on the topic.
'Nuff said.
Is that 'high rate of crime' attributable to the drugs, the
users, the dealers, the economic makeup of the illegal drug
industry, the U.S.'s method of responding to what I will agree
is a problem, public morality or what?
Saying that drugs causes crime is the equivivelent of saying
the welfare state causes poverty. Without looking too closely,
both statements can seem true, and may have some validity for
a particular situation, but is a vast, politically expedient
oversimplification that paves the way for a lot of ruthless
puritanical moralizing and self-righteous demonization, a lot
of public expense in money, human life and human dignity, and
a senseless rigidity in response to a situation that can be much
better dealt with, any way you measure it.
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So drugs are nasty becuase you have lost something to someone who *might*
have stolen becuase of dependency?
"Hey - I think that Republican stole my wallet! Republicans
should be illegal!"
(Yes, I'm being snide, and no, I won't defend it. I think my
point, that this is a rather lame, nonempirical appeal, should
be clear. I must say that all of this is so basic that I think
some sarcasm is not out of line.)

@_subject: Effects of Marking/Delaying Nonsigned Posts 
I don't think marking or delaying constitutes an effective bar
from the list.
I do think that marks are redundant (as Tim said, it is pretty
obvious who signs and who doesn't), and that delays will degrade
the quality of discussion on the list (time lag for only some has
a way fragmenting discussion, as anyone with a sometimes-slow link
can attest). Degrading the list value, I would think, not your
intended goal and would punish the rest of the list members for a
non-signer's sins, so to speak. This, of course, depends on the
lag - 5 minutes won't matter, but why bother? 1 day would (IMHO)
kill quite a bit of discussion. Somewhere in between (the 2-4 hours
you mentioned in one post) could head either way.
If you are set on this idea, may I echo someone else's suggestion
of an autoresponder to annoy those posting without signing? Doesn't
impact the list, we all still know who is not signing, and the culprit
gets to delete a message informing them of where to find the latest
version of PGP.

@_subject: Effects of Marking/Delaying Nonsigned Posts 
I disagree with your inferrence that quality would stay roughly
the same.
This seems to indicate that Tim is currently having trouble taking
part in much of the discussion that is currently not directed at
him due to delays in email processing.
Gosh, I wonder if that effects the quality of his Cypherpunks
Multiply that by a possible 25% (arbitrary) of the list being delayed
 andmy crystal ball says round after round of the same replies and
comments from different people will filter in after the discussion
of the original comment ceaces. This frustrates the readership who
is trying to find the meat of the list as well as the senders (which,
it should be noted, is the desired goal) by having thier material
appear irrelevent due to being delayed. I'm worried about the reader,
mostly, but then there are those who will be frusterated enough to
leave, for example Tim.  Or perhaps I am one of the few here who values
Tim's comments to the list enough to think the list would loose something
if he took off. And I'd wager that Tim isn't the only one who would leave.
Perhaps your ability to filter the garbage from the treasure is
truly uncanny, Eric, and all this wouldn't effect you. I don't think
most of the rest of us are quite so amazing.
I guess this is the answer then.
There we go.
My mistake then, I thought you had proposed marking messages as unsigned
as an intermediate step. Too hard to keep track of who is saying what in
this particular thread.

Uh, I was paraphrasing the conclusions of the article in

sarcasm in my post to convey that.
Question - where did the below-highlighted opinion come from?
Also, I do disagree with your statement "security through
obscurity is no security at all." A rather high degree of
security can be had through obscurity, but it is often entirely
unpredictable whether or not a particlar 'obscurity method'
will be secure or not (any 15 year old hiding cigarettes under
the bed can attest to that). I see this as an extension of the
pricipals underlying modern crypto - it could be that a factoring
attack on RSA is possible but really obscure. It is simply an
example of more predictable security through obscurity. Perhaps
I'm pushing definitions a little too far here.

@_subject: SUFFERANCE remailers 
As I see it, the main things one must defend a single machine
acting as a remailer against are physical accesibility, denial
of service and violation through monitoring mail flow.
The physical accesibility problem is tricky, but obviously has
been done for other physical items.. Stick it somewhere secret.
Of course you can't know how secret it is until someone tries
to find it. Wireless communication, as others pointed out, are
pretty nessessary for this.
The other two problems are software, and have been discussed quite
a bit here.
The answers above aren't bery compelling, and I don't see much way
around this. Groups with large amounts resources are typically good
at finding things when they put thier minds to it.
The solution here, and I think this has been talked about here, too,
is to create redundant destributed remailers.
Issues here are trust, protocol and availability.
Trust could be developed through the web of trust method, encouraged
by existing remailers using this protocol, but the key issue is being
able to trust a message going over potentially insecure remailer nodes
can be considered valid if delivered. That way if Julf ends up being a
under-deep-cover NSA agent and this hypothetical remailer-web is infested
with bad-guys, there is still nothing they can do except render a message
I'm trying to come up with something good here, but am still working
on it. The vision I have for remailers in a perfect world is that
everyone runs one and bounces around message 'packets' (small parts of
the message (all signed and encrypted multiple times, of course)
according to specific instructions. In a less than perfect world,
a smaller network running this method could be created.
This takes the form of the originator dumping the message into the
stream, and forwards them off to some other sites. The message would
be split into small packets which are encrypted multiple times to
multiple different sites into the stream. This would probably have
to be done by software, as it would be a complex task to manually
split, encrypt etc. any but the smallest message. The software would
need to be kept up to date about all potential public keys to encrypt
to, and need to pick a set at random from this info. It would also
insert routing intstructions as needed.
The next site checks to see if it can decrypt the packet it
recieves. If it can, it does so and  sends it forwards it somewhere
else, and repeat. If not, it just sends it onward. This continues for
n layers of encryption for each packet, with the final message in the
form of x packets encrypted only once ending up at the proper destination,
which reassembles  the message. All remailers reorder packets and insert
noise as apporpriate.
Obvious problems are bandwidth, time delay and having a site the
message was signed to go down. The last issue can be taken care of
by having group keys for this purpose, so that a given layer of
encryption can be decrypted by any one of n sites with key m. This
adds the problem of someone collecting all the keys and being able
to crack the whole thing, but I think this is surmoutable.
Band width and time delay stem from the same problem, and obviously
this system would never work on the internet as it stands. If this
web were, say, 300 sites worldwide, then they could work conjunction
with the pre- existing remailers now available.
Also, if the network grew to the point where it was impracticle to bounce
at random, intermediate steps could be added, such as 'send me to austalia'
or 'send me to mafiaNet', which would then cut down the number of bounces
before a layer of decription was achived.
