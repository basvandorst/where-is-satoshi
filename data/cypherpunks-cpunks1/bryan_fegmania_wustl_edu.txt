vat is available from ftp.ee.lbl.gov.  There's no source at the moment
but there are binaries for different architectures.  (And the dynamically
linked SunOS 4.1.x versions do work for Solaris 2.x)
vat is intended for use as a IP multicast multi-user chat program, but I
believe that it is useable for point-to-point communication also.  Using
it for IP Multicast may require kernel patches (depending on your OS).
[I have no connection with vat other than I use it for MBONE stuff
 here at Washington University]
