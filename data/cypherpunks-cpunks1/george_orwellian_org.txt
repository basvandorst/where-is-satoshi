Hacker Defaces Pro-Israel Web Site
By JOHN SCHWARTZ
The Web site for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying
group, was defaced Wednesday with anti-Israeli commentary - an
increasingly common occurrence as the escalating conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians has spilled over into cyberspace.
But this time the intruders also downloaded some 3,500 e-mail addresses
and 700 credit card numbers from the site, sent anti-Israeli diatribes
to the mailing list and published the credit card data on the Internet.
"This hack is to protest against the atrocities in Palestine by the
barbarian Israeli soldiers and their constant support by the U.S.
government," said a manifesto that the attackers put in place of the
lobbying group's home page.

Veterans Department Sued
By Employees Over Privacy Breach
Friday, November 3, 2000
By D. Ian Hopper
WASHINGTON - Department of Veterans Affairs employees are suing the
government, accusing the VA of breaching their privacy by giving fellow
workers and some patients access to their Social Security numbers and
dates of birth.
The class-action suit on behalf of the VA's 180,000 employees seeks
$1,000 for each one, the minimum amount under the 1974 Privacy Act.
If successful, that would total about $180 million.
The suit says that through an internal patient record system, employees'
personal information appeared along with the medical information on
patients. Workers at any VA facility could check up on VA workers
anywhere else, said the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Wisconsin last month. It said there were no warning screens or logs
of who accessed the information.

CHANGED DRIVER'S LICENSE AT ISSUE
Sources told MSNBC.com's Jeannette Walls that Bush associates had been worried for several years about his arrest record and had hoped that because it was in Maine, and not Texas, it wouldn't surface.
The sources said Bush took one step to keep it under wraps in March 1995, when his driver's license number was changed. Walls first reported this in August 1999 in The Scoop, an MSNBC.com column. At the time, the sources told Walls that Bush got his license number changed because he was worried about an arrest record surfacing.
"He has an arrest record that has to do with drinking," a source said then. "He's worried it will come out, but his handlers keep assuring him it won't."
The allegation was not disclosed by MSNBC.com at the time because the arrest could not be confirmed.
Also in August 1999, the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles told MSNBC.com that changing one's driver's license number was "highly unusual" and that it is done only when the holder of the license can prove that someone is using the license number for illegal activities.
Repeated calls to Bush's camp back at the time were unanswered, until a spokeswoman for Bush said the motor vehicle agency would have an additional comment. An agency spokesman then called MSNBC and said Bush's license number was changed for "security measures." He declined to comment further.
A spokesman for Bush left a phone message Friday saying license numbers are changed "as a matter of course and courtesy for statewide elected officials. It's offered to all statewide elected officials in Texas."
A spokesman for the governor's office in Texas reiterated this and said other governors were also given the option of changing their license numbers.

For some reason, certain polling areas got jammed up,

open longer so the people could vote. It didn't matter
who the people might vote for, despite the Democrats
asking for the extended hours.
The Republicans actually went into federal court to

And here's the details...the move is allowed under
state law. Once example was someone who tried to
vote at starting at 10AM but couldn't.
#    #    Judge Extends St. Louis Polling Hours Tuesday, November 7, 2000
#    #    ST. LOUIS - A circuit court judge ordered Tuesday evening that #    polls in St. Louis be kept open until 10 p.m. Central time, three #    extra hours, due to long lines, a shortage of judges and a lack #    of booths, ballots and other equipment.
#    #    The judge ruled on a petition filed by Democratic Congressional #    candidate William Lacy Clay, who cited that voters have not been #    able to get in to the polls, and have frequently been finding #    they are not on the voting lists.
#    #    Joining in filing the petition were the Missouri Democratic #    Committee and the Gore-Lieberman campaign.
#    #    Judge Evelyn M. Baker ruled in favor of the petitioners because #    of an especially heavy turnout. The Board of Election #    Commissioners "failed to live up to its duty to the voters of #    the city," Baker said.
#    #    Under the emergency order issued less than an hour before the #    polls were to have closed, the election board was to be kept #    open until 11:59 p.m.
#    #    Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush #    were unsuccessful in having the case heard in federal court. #    Moments after Baker's ruling, a U.S. District Judge declined #    to hear the case, saying it was a state issue.
#    #    The Board of Election Commissioners planned to file an immediate #    appeal.
#    #    Jim Grebing, a spokesman for Secretary of State Bekki Cook, said #    the office had learned of the judge's order through the news #    media.
#    #    But Grebing said that the move is allowed under Missouri election #    law.
#    #    "We were surprised, we didn't know anything about it," Grebing #    said. "But they didn't have to go through us, and we weren't #    consulted about it."
#    #    The petition charged that numerous city voters were unable to #    vote. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said irregularities at the polls, #    including the inability of judges to verify voter registration, #    set numerous voters on a path taking several hours to confirm.
#    #    Voters whose registration was not on record at their polling #    places had to travel to the board's downtown office where several #    hundred people waited up to three hours to confirm their #    registration.
#    #    Mahina Nightsage, 41, said she attempted to vote at 10 a.m. but #    was told by an election judge that she was not registered for #    that polling place. Nightsage said she arrived at the board's #    downtown office by 12:30 and by 3:15 p.m. had not yet been able #    to vote.
#    #    "That is too much of a burden for anyone to exercise their #    constitutional right to vote," Nightsage said.
#    #    Nightsage said she spoke to many other frustrated voters at the #    board's office, some of whom left without voting.
#    #    The petitioners presented several affidavits from voters with #    similar stories.
#    #    An attorney for the Bush-Cheney campaign asked that the suit #    be removed to federal court because federal offices were at stake.
#    #    Kevin Coan, the Republican director of elections for the board, #    said election procedures were no different from any other. Coan #    said he knew of no one whose right to vote had been denied.
#    #    Coan said much of the confusion may have rested with people who #    did not register in time to vote, yet showed up expecting to #    be able to cast a ballot.
#    #    "I doubt they have any idea what the election laws of this state #    are," Coan said.
TimMay was entirely silent on why he objects to this time extension.

#    #    November 9, 2000 #    #    Lawsuit to Recover Lost Gore Votes Overshadows the Recount in #    Florida
#    #    By GLENN R. SIMPSON, JACKIE CALMES and CHAD TERHUNE Staff #    Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    Overshadowing a state ballot recount in the tightest presidential #    election in memory, Democrats filed suit to help Al Gore recover #    thousands of votes he may have lost because of a confusing ballot #    in Palm Beach County.
#    #    Democratic State Sen. Ron Klein and lawyer Jeffrey Liggio, #    official observers in the Palm Beach County recount, said county #    officials disqualified 19,120 presidential votes here on Tuesday #    because voters selected more than one candidate. That is about #    4.14% of total votes cast in the county for president, an #    unusually high figure, says Mr. Klein.
#    #    The figures were confirmed by Carol Roberts, a county commissioner #    and a member of the Palm Beach County canvassing board. She added #    in an interview that ballots were rejected in the Florida Senate #    contest at a far lower rate -- 0.82%.
#    #    Democrats said they believe most of the disqualified votes were #    cast for Al Gore and Pat Buchanan by confused voters who intended #    to pick Mr. Gore, but inadvertently selected both men because #    of the proximity of their names on the paper ballot. If they #    are correct, the problem may have cost Mr. Gore a clear margin #    of victory here statewide and could boost calls to overturn the #    Florida results, which favored George W. Bush by less than 2,000 #    votes.
#    #    Late Wednesday, a suit was filed in Palm Beach County circuit #    court by three local Democrats to force a new vote in the county #    because of the allegedly confusing ballots.
#    #    "It's pretty clear this ballot defect has thwarted the will of #    the people in that county in an amount that would appear to be #    in excess of the current margin between Bush and Gore statewide #    -- well in excess," said Democratic ballot lawyer Chris Sautter, #    an adviser to the Gore campaign who isn't involved in the suit.
#    #    The layout of the ballot was intended to make it easier for #    seniors to read. "Obviously, it didn't work that way," said Mr. #    Klein.
#    #    Democrats are exploring the possibility that the ballot design #    violates state standards. An official in the governor's office #    disputed the idea, saying the standards only apply to ballots #    counted manually.
#    #    Reeve Bright, a lawyer for the Republican Party of Palm Beach #    County, conceded the 19,000 disqualified votes occurred. But #    that doesn't mean the tossed-out votes were all for Gore, he #    stressed. He added that he didn't know whether the total was #    an unusually high one.
#    #    "They're just blowing smoke," he said of Democrats' concerns. #    "Are they trying to say the voters are that incompetent, that #    they can't read and follow directions?"
#    #    Complaints of ballot confusion and the lawsuit came as state #    officials were outlining the process by which all 67 Florida #    counties would recount the ballots cast Tuesday and help determine #    which candidate wins the state's 25 electoral votes. As of #    Wednesday morning, George W. Bush led by about 1,800 votes of #    the nearly six million cast.
#    #    "What happens here will determine the next presidency of the #    United States," said Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth.
#    #    Appearing with Mr. Butterworth was Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the #    Republican candidate's brother. To avoid the appearance of a #    conflict of interest, Jeb Bush said he won't serve on the #    three-member state canvassing board that will meet to certify #    final results after Florida counties complete their recount.
#    #    State officials had set 5 p.m. Thursday as the deadline for the #    recount, but the governor suggested a further wrinkle: An #    estimated 3,000 ballots still arriving from Florida military #    personnel abroad could further delay the outcome by as many as #    10 days.
#    #    Florida's electoral votes would give either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore #    the election. Without Florida, Mr. Gore leads narrowly in the #    national popular vote, and he carried enough states to compile #    260 electoral votes -- 10 shy of the 270 needed for an Electoral #    College majority. Mr. Bush has 246 electoral votes. Besides #    Florida, Oregon was also still too close to call Wednesday because #    of delays in counting ballots in what was the state's first #    mail-in presidential election. But Oregon's seven electoral votes #    aren't enough to give either man the majority.
#    #    Meanwhile, the two campaigns each dispatched a former U.S. #    secretary of state -- Warren Christopher for Mr. Gore, and James #    Baker for Mr. Bush -- to monitor events here.
#    #    Locally, Florida's county officials were largely on their own #    to figure out how to recount the votes in their areas. Many #    expected the recount to take only a few hours, but scheduling #    conflicts with their canvassing boards were causing delays.
#    #    "Most of us were in at 5:30 a.m. and went home after midnight. #    And now we're recreating yesterday. It will be a long night," #    Marilyn Gerkin, supervisor of elections in Sarasota County, said.
#    #    Democrat Kurt Browning, a Pasco County elections supervisor, #    said a recount was almost certain to show differences from the #    original count across the state, in part because of "hanging #    chads." Those are bits of paper that sometimes cling to the punch #    cards used in most of Florida's larger counties, filling in the #    punch hole and effectively invalidating the voter's choice if #    counted by machine. When counted by hand, it is easier to #    distinguish the voter's selection and validate the ballot.
#    #    In Orange County in Central Florida, Elections Supervisor Bill #    Cowles was going through a few hundred rejected ballots by hand #    with his canvassing board. The ballot-counting machines had thrown #    out those ballots Tuesday because of stray pen marks or voters #    choosing two candidates in the same race. They hadn't been counted #    at all until Wednesday, so Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush stood to gain #    a few votes.
#    #    Once conducted, the ballot recounts will be submitted to the #    state canvassing board, which, besides Florida Gov. Bush, includes #    Secretary of State Katherine Harris and Division of Elections #    Chief Clay Roberts. The secretary of state's office will name #    a replacement for Gov. Bush.
#    #    Any challenge of the results would likely require legal action, #    for which both sides were preparing. Florida Democrats announced #    a "voter fraud hotline" to collect complaints that could form #    the basis of a challenge.
#    #    Regarding the Palm Beach County lawsuit, local-elections #    supervisor Theresa LePore said in a statement that her office #    has an "unblemished record of public trust." We remain committed #    to protecting this reputation," the statement continued. She #    estimated the recount in Palm Beach County would take about six #    hours after starting Wednesday afternoon.
#    #    Others contend the ballot flap was nonsense. "This is a #    manufactured controversy," says Rep. Mark Foley (R., Fla.), the #    local congressman. Mr. Buchanan received 3,407 votes in Palm #    Beach County yesterday and 8,788 votes there in the 1996 GOP #    primary. So, Mr. Foley reasons, Tuesday's results aren't that #    "out of whack."
#    #    The problems in Palm Beach County echo the last statewide ballot #    controversy in Florida, when Connie Mack beat Buddy MacKay for #    a U.S. Senate seat in 1988. The design of the Palm Beach County #    ballot was a major problem in that race as well. A recount did #    not change the outcome, and though Democrats complained, they #    did not take legal action.
#    #    South Florida had a recent bout with voter fraud that triggered #    tougher state laws in 1998 on voting by absentee ballot. #    Investigations found rampant absentee-ballot fraud in the 1997 #    Miami mayoral race, including vote-brokering and the buying and #    selling of votes, and a court ordered a new election. The U.S. #    Justice Department later rejected the state reforms, saying they #    could discriminate against a high number of minority voters who #    rely on absentee voting because of a lack of transportation or #    the ability to get time off from work.

#    #    Florida Judges Have Power to Upset Elections
#    #    By DAVID G. SAVAGE and HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writers
#    #    #    WASHINGTON--Florida's Supreme Court has given judges in the state
#    broad power to overturn an election if flawed ballots create
#    "reasonable doubt" that the outcome truly reflects "the will
#    of the voters."
#    #    The law is not clear, however, on how to remedy such a mistake,
#    especially when a flawed ballot in one county might have changed
#    a statewide result--let alone possibly determine the outcome
#    of a national election for president of the United States.
#    #    "We are in uncharted territory," said University of Florida Law
#    School Dean Jon Mills. Yet Democratic lawyers in Florida were
#    pointing Thursday to legal decisions that give them a basis for
#    going to court to challenge the outcome there because of ballot
#    confusion in Palm Beach County.
#    #    In an opinion issued in 1998, the Florida Supreme Court said
#    that disputed elections can be voided even when there is no
#    evidence of fraud or vote stealing. The justices stressed that
#    election results should reflect the will of the voters.

#    #    Judge halts certification of Palm Beach ballots
#    #    The Associated Press
#    #    West Palm Beach -- Presidential ballots in Palm Beach County #    can't be certified by the state pending a Tuesday court hearing, #    a circuit judge ruled Thursday.
#    #    The preliminary injunction means the county, embroiled in a #    controversy over punchcard ballots that allegedly confused voters, #    could further delay for days the outcome of the presidential #    race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
#    #    The order, issued Thursday night by Circuit Judge Kathleen Kroll, #    is the result of one of six lawsuits filed in Palm Beach County #    by voters who say they may have mistakenly voted for Reform Party #    candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Vice President Gore because #    of the way the ballot was designed. Two other lawsuits filed #    in Tallahassee allege race discrimination in Tuesday's balloting.
#    #    The Palm Beach County voters want a new election in the county.
#    #    In the order, Kroll wrote that based on a lawsuit filed by two #    Boca Raton women it appears they would suffer ``irreparable #    injury'' if the votes are certified before the case can be heard.
#    #    ``To preserve the electoral process in this presidential election #    and the important voters' rights at stake, there is an immediate #    need for a resolution in this case,'' Kroll wrote.

#    Palm Beach County Orders Manual Recount of Bush-Gore Vote
#    By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
#    WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Palm Beach County officials ordered an
#    extraordinary countywide recount, by hand, of the more than
#    425,000 votes cast in the presidential election for Al Gore and
#    George W. Bush.
#    Gore added 36 votes and Bush lost three in a machine recount
#    of Palm Beach County in Florida's disputed presidential balloting.
#    A hand count of selected precincts turned up enough errors in
#    the election night vote to prompt county election officials to
#    order a complete recount by hand. The vote early Saturday was
#    2-1.
#    "This clearly would affect the national vote," said Carol Roberts,
#    a county commissioner and a member of the canvassing commission.
#    Election officials said their exhaustive manual recount found
#    numerous differences from the machine count. Roberts said the
#    errors point to potentially 1,900 errors county wide -- more
#    than the existing statewide margin between Bush and Gore.
#    At stake is no less than the presidency, since Florida will
#    deliver 25 electoral votes.

#    Palm Beach Official Disputes Claim By Bush Campaign on Invalid
#    Ballots
#    By JACKIE CALMES Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    WASHINGTON -- The Bush campaign is dead wrong on one of its prime
#    arguments in response to complaints about voter confusion in
#    Florida's Palm Beach County, according to a top county official.
#    Palm Beach County Commissioner Carol Roberts said in an interview
#    Friday that about 30,000 ballots were invalidated for their
#    presidential selection this week because voters had punched two
#    holes or none. That is more than twice the 14,000 invalidated
#    in 1996, which could be evidence of some amount of voter confusion
#    about the county ballot's much-criticized design.
#    This week, both Bush campaign Chairman Don Evans and chief
#    strategist Karl Rove have claimed that about 19,000 ballots'
#    presidential votes were invalidated, or not significantly more
#    than four years ago, when turnout was lower. But that 19,000
#    represents only the invalidated ballots with two holes punched
#    for president, the commissioner says. More than 10,000 additional
#    ballots were invalidated for having no presidential vote, she
#    explains, for a combined 30,000.
#    "It's not a correct argument," Ms. Roberts, a Democrat, said
#    of the Bush officials' contention that this year's invalidated
#    ballots are comparable to the number four years ago. "It's just
#    not accurate."
%    More importantly, the ballot was approved by both
%    parties before the election took place.
Thus demonstrating the ballot design problem is non-partisan.
I asked a [Bush-voting] friend why the live-and-let-die attitude
towards such a large loss of people's votes, and he admitted it
was because he wanted Bush to win, and that Gore probably had

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
To the citizens of the United States of America,
In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus
to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
independence, effective today.
Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties
over all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah,
which she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair,
MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a
world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without
the need for further elections.  Congress and the Senate will be
disbanded.  A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine
whether any of you noticed.
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following
rules are introduced with immediate effect:
1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.
Then look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be
amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.  Generally, you
should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up "vocabulary".
Using the same twenty seven words  interspersed with filler noises such as
"like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of
communication.  Look up  "interspersed".
2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know on
your behalf.
3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It
really isn't that hard.
4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the
good guys.
5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen",
but only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get
confused and give up half way through.
6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind of
football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game.
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders
may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.  You will no
longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.
Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.  It is a difficult
game.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby
(which is similar to American "football", but does not involve stopping for
a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like
nancies).  We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by
7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if
they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is
a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.  The Russians
have never been the bad guys.  "Merde" is French for "sh*t".
8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called "Indecisive Day".
9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for your
own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.
10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.
Thank you for your cooperation.

Let's see...
A lawyer for Bush held a street corner news conference
saying he's caught one of the Palm Beach County election
officials dropping some questionable ballots into Gore's
pile. Both the lawyer and the official share the name Carol,
I think.
The Florida Secy of State, (Bush FL co-campaign manager,
$6.5 millionare, spent $100,000 of the state's money on
trips to Brazil and such, made a get-out-the-vote ad
with taxpayer money featuring Schwartzkopf), has filed
with the FL Supreme Court to consolidate all possible
lawsuits and asks that the counties be told to stop
recounts. Basically, to take over decisions. Odd,
given that they're heavily Democratic. (appointed, at least)
I guess Bush plans on going to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Palm Beach County election officials haven't started a recount.
They are discussing changing the "chad" rules so that even
an indentation (without a corner of the chad detached) can
be ruled as a choice. Apparently there were a significant
number of party-line votes for every (one party) office
except for president, and many were indented for president.
Hey, maybe the card was stiff there. Someone had statistics
showing few people vote for every office but president.
I still can't imagine using these sort of cards at all,
since I remember as an operator I would riffle Hollerith
cards a few times before putting them in the hopper, to
avoid jams. I wonder if there's an official procedure
for the operator to riffle in consideration of the
detachable chads.
And, oh yeah, the U.S.P.S. announced they've sped up
delivery of any absentee ballots.

@_subject: CDR: Florida absentee ballots 
Overseas absentee ballots, as opposed to in-state...
WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 15-With the presidential election supposedly hanging on Friday's count of absentee ballots from overseas, observers caution this potential bomb may turn out to be a dud. So far only 447 military ballots have been received by the postal authorities. At that rate, The Washington Post calculates, the amount of military ballots would end up at an underwhelming 750-a far cry from the originally projected 2300. Military votes were projected to make up the bulk of overseas ballots, which are set to be tallied on Friday, November 17.
As the Voice reported last week, Monte Friedkin, chairman of the Palm Beach County Democratic Party, said state elections officials had not picked up at least 500 absentee ballots from the post office on Election Day, raising the possibility that someone is tampering with the absentee vote.
In theory, absentee ballots from the armed forces would help Republican George W. Bush, who clings to a slender 300-vote margin. In 1996, Republican Bob Dole received most of those votes. But Pentagon observers caution this may not be the case. While there is no love lost for Clinton-Gore among the military branches, it's not a done deal by any means. Soldiers and sailors vote along class lines, with the brass going for Bush. But the enlisted soldiers, especially black men and women, could just as easily turn out for Gore.
Florida beefed up its laws governing absentee ballots after a Miami election was overturned due to fraud. But Democrats question whether the statutes are working, because they claim Republic
an-controlled county elections officials violated the law by sending out absentee ballots to people who didn't ask for them. State law stipulates voters must request absentee ballots.
Perhaps the small number of absentee ballots can be explained by the following: WorldNetDaily reported yesterday that a source on the USS Tarawa, a U.S. assault ship near Yemen, said that "thousands" of ballots were languishing onboard.
The Pentagon, which first denied this report, now says, according to the New York Post, that the ballots of some 3000 sailors and marines on the USS Tarawa, USS Duluth, and USS Anchorage would be flown back to the United States "expeditiously."
Capt. Van P. Brinson, who says he did not receive his absentee ballot, told WorldNetDaily he penned a November 8 e-mail in which  "I cannot speak for the remainder of the crew of the Tarawa, but I do know that the majority of the Marines and sailors that I have spoken with are in the same boat. What is distressing about the situation is that a majority of the pilots aboard are registered voters in Florida." Stripped of confusing press reporting and legalistic mumbo jumbo, the results of the endless Florida recount so far amount to next to nothing. According to Sam Smith?s Prorev.com afternoon tally, after a week of recounting, the change in the vote "finally certified by the state for Palm Beach County represented two-tenths of 1 percent." As reported previously, Gore carried Palm Beach County by 140,000 votes, collecting 24 percent of the total vote.

#    #    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Not every vote counts.
#    #    George W. Bush and Al Gore are just 300 votes apart in Florida's #    presidential election, but more than 180,000 Floridians who went #    to the polls on Nov. 7 could have just stayed home. Their ballots #    were tossed out because they chose more than one presidential #    candidate, didn't choose one at all or their vote didn't register.
#    #    That's nearly 3 percent of the 6,138,567 ballots that Florida #    citizens turned in. Experts say the national average usually #    runs at less than 2 percent, depending on the type of voting #    method used.
#    #    The problem in Florida largely can be traced to paper punchcard #    ballots, which have helped derail the presidential election and #    added "chad" to the national lexicon.
#    #    Some counties had startlingly large numbers of ballots that #    weren't counted. All three of these used punchcards:
#    #    - In Miami-Dade County, 28,601 ballots were not counted in the #    presidential race, out of about 654,044 cast.
#    #    - In Palm Beach County, home of the controversial "butterfly #    ballot," 29,702 votes weren't counted out of 462,888 total.
#    #    - In Jacksonville and surrounding Duval County, 26,909 votes #    went uncounted out of 291,545 cast.
#    #    Election lawyer Kenneth Gross, who worked for Bob Dole's 1996 #    presidential campaign, said the problem is that holes on the #    cards aren't always clean.
#    #    "If there's any paper hanging, the machine tends to push it back #    into the hole and then records it as a no vote," Gross said.
#    #    Leon County, where the state capital, Tallahassee, is located, #    was another story altogether. There were only 181 votes that #    weren't counted, just 0.2 percent of the total.
#    #    That's largely because Leon and 14 other Florida counties use #    an optical scan system in which voters fill in a bubble with #    a pen instead of punching a hole in a card.

Girl Arrested for Eating Fries in Subway
 Police Cite 'Zero Tolerance' No-Food Rule
 Nov. 16, 2000
 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mother of a
 12-year-old girl who was
 handcuffed, booked and
 fingerprinted for eating french
 fries in a subway station says
 police went too far.
 "I can't believe there isn't a better way to teach kids
 a lesson," said Tracey Hedgepeth, whose daughter Ansche
 was arrested. "The police treated her like a criminal."
 But Metro Transit Police Chief Barry J. McDevitt is
 unapologetic about Ansche's arrest last month and
 others like it.
 "We really do believe in zero tolerance," he said.
 Undercover operation
 Commuter complaints about unlawful eating on Metro cars
 and in stations led McDevitt to mount an undercover
 crackdown on violators. A dozen plainclothes officers
 cited or arrested 35 people, 13 of them juveniles. Only
 one adult was arrested.
 The seventh-grade girl said the station in northwest
 Washington where she was nabbed is "just a place where
 a lot of kids go. There's a hot dog stand and Cafe Med,
 where I bought my fries."
 She said she took the elevator to the station with a
 friend. As the pair passed the station kiosk, a man
 stepped in front of Ansche.
 'Put down your fries'
 "He said: 'Put down your fries. Put down your book
 bag,'" Ansche said. "They searched my book bag and
 searched me. They asked me if I have any drugs or
 alcohol."
 Ansche said she has never been asked those questions or
 searched like that before. "I was embarrassed. I told
 my friend to call my mom, but I didn't tell anybody
 else," she said.
 She said she never talked to the officer, although
 Metro police insist that she was asked whether she knew
 eating was against the law and that she said she did.
 They said anyone who doesn't know about the law usually
 is given a warning first.
 Signs warning that it is illegal to eat or drink on the
 cars and in the stations are posted in the Metro
 system.
 Custody for juveniles
 She was taken to the detention center, where she was
 checked in, fingerprinted and held for her parents to
 pick her up.
 If Ansche had been an adult, she simply would have
 received citations for fines up to $300. But juveniles
 who commit criminal offenses in the District of
 Columbia must be taken into custody, McDevitt said.
 It is department policy to handcuff anyone who is
 arrested, no matter the age, he said.
 Ansche must perform community service and undergo
 counseling at the Boys and Girls Club, one of the
 sentences Metro has chosen for underage snacking
 lawbreakers.
 Bad trash problem
 McDevitt said the Tenleytown stop where the arrest
 occurred has had a particularly bad trash problem.
 "We had not only customers complaining," he said.
 "Train conductors were also complaining about how
 trashed their trains were, and they were asking for
 more enforcement."
 Hedgepeth said she agrees with sticking to the rules,
 but wonders why police couldn't issue warnings.
 "How do they expect kids to grow up trusting police?"
 she said. "My daughter will now grow up knowing she's
 been in handcuffs. All over a french fry."

 Feds Raid Home of Ex-Klansman
 By Cain Burdeau
 ASSOCIATED PRESS
MANDEVILLE, La.  Federal agents raided the home of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke on Thursday, carting off boxes of documents and a rifle during a search that lasted more than seven hours. FBI agent Sheila Thorne refused to disclose the nature of the investigation.
But Roy Armstrong, who identified himself as Duke's bodyguard and a caretaker at the house, said agents told him they were looking into whether Duke was illegally using money raised for his new white-rights organization for his personal use.
"It's a fishing expedition," Armstrong said. Duke's associates said that the 50-year-old former KKK leader and one-time state legislator was in Russia, promoting a new book, and that they had not been able to reach him.
His new organization is the National Organization For European American Rights, or NOFEAR. He launched it in January, declaring that whites in the United States face "massive discrimination" at the hands of minorities. Agents from the FBI, Internal Revenue Service and the Postal Inspection Service took part in the search of Duke's home in a suburb outside New Orleans. Agents carried out about a dozen boxes.
Armstrong showed reporters a copy of the search warrant, which sought a variety of financial and personal records, including gambling and travel records and direct mailings.
As for the rifle, Armstrong said agents told him they believed it was stolen. Armstrong said that he had never seen the gun before and that he did not know whether it belonged to Duke.
Duke appeared before a federal grand jury in New Orleans in 1999 as news broke that Gov. Mike Foster had paid him more than $150,000 for a list of his supporters, supposedly for use during the 1995 governor's race. Duke had considered entering that race but ultimately stayed out of it. The grand jury reportedly was seeking information on whether Duke paid taxes on the money.
It was not known if the raid on Duke's home had anything to do with that matter.
Foster "hasn't spoken to the FBI," said the governor's spokeswoman, Marsanne Golsby. "He doesn't know anything about it." Foster, a Republican, paid a $20,000 fine to the state Board of Ethics in connection with the list of supporters.
Duke spent years on the political fringe, first as a Klan leader with neo-Nazi sympathies, then as founder of the National Association for the Advancement of White People, which decried He got elected to the state House in 1989 as a Republican and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1990, pulling 44 percent of the vote against Democratic Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
In the 1991 governor's race, he shocked the political establishment by making it into a runoff with former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who was trying for a comeback. Edwards won in a Duke made a run for the presidency in Southern primaries in 1992 but was soundly defeated. He finished third in the 1999 race to replace Rep. Bob Livingston in Congress.

#    #    Democrats Rue Ballot Foul-Up in a 2nd County
#    #    By RAYMOND BONNER with JOSH BARBANEL
#    #    ACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 16 - Democrats in Duval County prepared #    meticulously for Election Day. They registered thousands of voters #    and ferried enough people to the polls in predominantly #    African-American precincts to give a solid boost to Vice President #    Al Gore in a county expected to swing reliably into Gov. George #    W. Bush's column.
#    #    But the results of Duval County's vote left Democrats here shaking #    their heads. More than 26,000 ballots were invalidated, the vast #    majority because they contained votes for more than one #    presidential candidate. Nearly 9,000 of the votes were thrown #    out in the predominantly African-American communities around #    Jacksonville, where Mr. Gore scored 10-to-1 ratios of victory, #    according to an analysis of the vote by The New York Times.
#    #    The percentage of invalidated votes here was far higher than #    that recorded in Palm Beach County, which has become the focus #    of national attention and where Democrats have argued that so #    many people were disenfranchised it may be necessary to let them #    vote again. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have demanded a #    hand recount or new election in Duval County.
#    #    Local election officials attributed the outcome to a ballot that #    had the name of presidential candidates on two pages, which they #    said many voters found confusing. Many voters, they said, voted #    once on each page. The election officials said they would not #    use such a ballot in the future.
#    #    Rodney G. Gregory, a lawyer for the Democrats in Duval County, #    said the party shared the blame for the confusion. Mr. Gregory #    said Democratic Party workers instructed voters, many persuaded #    to go to the polls for the first time, to cast ballots in every #    race and "be sure to punch a hole on every page."
#    #    "The get-out-the vote folks messed it up," Mr. Gregory said #    ruefully.
#    #    If Mr. Gregory's assessment is correct, and thousands of Gore #    supporters were inadvertently misled into invalidating their #    ballots, this county alone would have been enough to give Mr. #    Gore the electoral votes of Florida, and thus the White House.

#    #    David Duke Phones Home, Learns of FBI Raid
#    #    Monday, November 20, 2000, By Brett Martel
#    #    #    NEW ORLEANS - White supremacist David Duke finally called home #    from Russia to learn that federal agents raided his home last #    week and carried away boxes of materials, a spokesman said Monday.
#    #    "He was outraged at this invasion of his home," said Vincent #    Edwards, a spokesman for Duke's National Organization For #    European-American Rights.
#    #    The FBI is investigating whether Duke gambled away hundreds of #    thousands of dollars he solicited from supporters of his white #    supremacist cause. He has not been charged with a crime.
#    #    Duke has been in Russia to promote his new book, The Ultimate #    Supremacism, in which Duke argues that Russia and the former #    Soviet bloc can save the white race from Jewish oligarchs and #    organized crime. The book is being published in Russian.
#    #    Edwards said he has never known Duke to visit a casino in the #    two years he has worked for him, but said it would not be a crime #    if he had.
#    #    "He has been very clear in his mailings that the money is for #    his work and to sustain him personally," Edwards said. "If he #    accepts a supporter's check for $25 and happens to go out to #    dinner that night and it costs $25, it's not a crime."
#    #    Edwards also said he suspects the FBI's investigation is largely #    based on the claims of disgruntled employees who have no #    credibility.

#    #    Drug Checkpoints Struck Down by High Court
#    #    Tuesday, November 28, 2000
#    #    In a divided 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court on Monday struck down #    as unconstitutional random roadblocks intended to catch criminals #    trafficking drugs.
#    #    The ruling weighed privacy rights against the interests of law #    enforcement and found that Indianapolis' use of drug-sniffing #    dogs to check all cars pulled over at the roadblocks was an #    unreasonable search under the Constitution.
#    #    The majority, in an opinion written by Justice Sandra Day #    O'Connor, said the ruling does not affect other kinds of police #    roadblocks such as border checks and drunken-driving checkpoints. #    Those have already been found constitutional.
#    #    But the reasoning behind those kinds of roadblocks - chiefly #    that the benefit to the public outweighs the inconvenience - #    cannot be applied broadly, O'Connor wrote.
#    #    "If this case were to rest on such a high level of generality, #    there would be little check on the authorities' ability to #    construct roadblocks for almost any conceivable law enforcement #    purpose," the opinion said.
#    #    The three dissenters were the court's most conservative justices: #    Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and #    Clarence Thomas.
#    #    Lawyers for Indianapolis conceded that the roadblocks erected #    there in 1998 detained far more innocent motorists than criminals.
#    #    The city said its primary aim was to catch drug criminals. Civil #    liberties advocates called the practice heavy-handed and risky, #    and asked the Supreme Court to ban it.
#    #    Law enforcement in and of itself is not a good enough reason #    to stop innocent motorists, the majority ruling concluded.
#    #    The court was not swayed by the argument that the severity of #    the drug problem in some city neighborhoods justified the #    searches.
#    #    "While we do not limit the purposes that may justify a checkpoint #    program to any rigid set of categories, we decline to approve #    a program whose primary purpose is ultimately indistinguishable #    from the general interest in crime control," the majority opinion #    said.
#    #    Cars were pulled over at random in high-crime neighborhoods in #    Indianapolis, motorists questioned, and a drug-sniffing dog led #    around the cars. Most motorists were detained for about three #    minutes.
#    #    The city conducted six roadblocks over four months in 1998 before #    the practice was challenged in federal court.
#    #    Police stopped 1,161 cars and trucks and made 104 arrests. #    Fifty-five of the arrests were on drug charges.

#    #    Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    VeriSign Inc., a leader in handling registrations for ".com" #    Internet addresses, Tuesday announced it is investing in a small #    firm that controls Internet addresses ending in ".tv".
#    #    VeriSign, Mountain View, Calif., is the largest investor in a #    $28 million round of venture capital raised by .TV Corp. #    International, a closely held firm in Los Angeles that goes by #    the name of dotTV. International cable concern UnitedGlobalCom #    Inc., investment firm Munder Capital Management and other #    investors contributed to the funding, according to dotTV #    executives.
#    #    VeriSign, through its Network Solutions subsidiary, also plans #    to begin allowing registrations of .tv Internet addresses on #    the Network Solutions Web site. Network Solutions also will store #    .tv addresses in a collection of 13 industrial-strength computers #    around the world that handle look-ups of Internet addresses.
#    #    Network Solutions is the world's largest registrar of Internet #    address or "domain names" ending in .net., .org and .com. VeriSign #    and dotTV don't plan to disclose the financial terms of their #    marketing alliance, though VeriSign is expected to get a cut #    of the $50 annual fee dotTV charges customers for registering #    .tv domain names.
#    #    The marketing deal could be a big boost for tiny dotTV, which #    wants to establish .tv as an alternative domain name aimed at #    Web companies that feature hefty doses of multimedia programming #    on their sites. An oversight body called the Internet Corp. for #    Assigned Names & Numbers, or Icann, hopes to finalize a plan #    by the end of the year to create a number of new Internet address #    suffixes, including ".info," ".pro" and ".biz".
#    #    In the meantime, dotTV was able to license rights to the ".tv" #    domain name from Tuvalu, a small Pacific Island nation for which #    the suffix is an abbreviation. Under its agreement with dotTV, #    Tuvalu receives a minimum of $4 million a year during the next #    10 years, according to dotTV executives. Tuvalu also owns about #    20% of the company and has a seat on the dotTV board.

FBI's Carnivore Just the First Step In Cyber Surveillance
Monday, October 16, 2000
By Patrick Riley
The FBI says its controversial Carnivore system is just "the tip of the iceberg" when it comes to Internet surveillance because an even sharper-toothed information chomper is now in development.
Amid all the hubbub over whether the current system violates privacy rights, the agency has been quietly working on both "Carnivore 2.0" and "Carnivore 3.0," according to FBI documents released this month under a Freedom of Information Act claim filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The current Carnivore is version 1.3.4, according to the documents.
An "Enhanced Carnivore" program has been under development since last November - under a $650,000 contract scheduled to end in January 2001. Most of the details on the souped-up snoopers were blacked out in heavy black marker before the papers were released.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation makes no bones about its plans for the system, which sifts an Internet Service Provider's transmissions to track suspects' online activity.
"As it looks today, it could be completely different a year from now," said FBI spokesman Paul Bresson. "Really, we've only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of the change in technology."
He said improving Carnivore is vital for keeping pace with criminal "This is going to continue to be a cat-and-mouse game," he said. "There's always going to be software and other encryption technology that render a system less useful."
He declined to give specific details. But privacy experts say an evolving Carnivore presents a problem for those trying to keep an eye on it.
"It's a moving target," said David Banisar, a senior fellow at EPIC. "It means there needs to be continual oversight, not just onetime oversight. It means that if we get the source code we'll have to get the source code as it changes also, and do a re-analysis as the functions of the software change."
The program's source code, the piece of information most sought after by activists trying to figure out if Carnivore reads the e-mail of more than just those targeted by a court order, was omitted from the 600-plus pages given to EPIC in the first of several planned releases. But the organization has vowed to continue fighting for it.
Despite the incomplete technical blueprint, the newly public papers do shed some light on what sequels to Carnivore might look like.
Three jargon-heavy lines of text that survived the FBI censor reveal that Version 2.0 will be capable of "built-in data analysis that Carnivore doesn't appear to do now," Banisar said.
That means being able to display captured Internet data as soon as Carnivore intercepts it. The current system merely stores the data and two other programs - "Packeteer" and "Coolminer" - must be used to process and display it.
No information was released from the Version 3.0 section but research mentioned elsewhere in the unclassified papers involves an aspect of the technology dubbed "Dragon Net" that captures telephone conversations held via the Web - a process known as "voice over IP" technology.
Banisar suspects the FBI might also want its future sniffers to have the ability to track multiple targets simultaneously. That wouldn't bode well, he said. "The more capability it has to intercept more than one target, the more likely it is to be abused."
While the current Carnivore is purely monogamous, it casts a wider net than commonly thought, according to an analysis of the FBI documents by anti-computer crime site SecurityFocus.com.
Carnivore can "be programmed to watch for all the Internet activities of a particular person," said Kevin Poulson, editorial director at SecurityFocus and a former hacker. The system can even reconstruct Web pages viewed by a suspect. "All that's been talked about is its ability to monitor e-mail."
In light of this, said EPIC's Banisar: "It makes you wonder what else they could possibly want."

Criminal charges filed against 'Echelon'
By Steve Gold
A Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Berlin has filed criminal complaints in Germany against the international Echelon computer surveillance network.
Unlike the recently vilified Carnivore Internet monitoring system installed on most U.S. Internet Service Provider (ISP) servers, the Echelon system is shrouded in secrecy.
Thought to have been created in the 1940s by the U.S. and UK governments, the system is now known to monitor most voice and data traffic circulating in most West countries.
Reports suggest that it can legally do this by side-stepping national anti-surveillance legislation by requiring, for example, the U.S. government's National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor UK comms traffic, and, similarly, using the UK's security agencies to monitor U.S. comms In her complaint, Ilka Schrvder, a Green Party Member of the European Parliament (MEP) cited "unknown suspects especially from the U.S. And Great Britain, as well as possibly the German Federal Government, for operating and tolerating the Echelon network."
According to German media reports, Schrvder filed the complaints Monday with the German Federal chief public prosecutor, as well as public prosecutors' offices in Berlin and, perhaps significantly, in Traunstein. The Traunstein office covers the Bavarian town of Bad Aibling, where a monitoring station is generally reported as being operated by the NSA.
Schrvder, who serves as a substitute member of the European Parliament committee which is investigating Echelon, referred to a report commissioned by the committee, which confirmed that Echelon is monitoring private and business telephone calls, faxes, and e-mail messages in Europe, including in Germany.
This is not the first time that Echelon has come into the legal firing line. Back in February, reports suggested that the French government was considering lawsuits on privacy grounds, alleging that the international Echelon super-spy network monitored French companies, diplomats and ministers.
The Echelon network has been talked about in security circles for several years, but its existence was most recently confirmed in November 1999, when the BBC reported that an Australian government official had confirmed the network actually existed.
At the time, the BBC reported that Bill Blick, Australia's inspector general of intelligence, confirmed that his country's Defence Signals Directorate forms part of the Echelon network.
"As you would expect there are a large amount of radio communications floating around in the atmosphere, and agencies such as the DSD collect those communications in the interests of their national security," Blick told the BBC.
Asked if information is then passed on to the U.S. or the UK, Blick replied that "in certain circumstances" it was.
The BBC report followed hard on the heels of an attempt on Oct. 22, 1999, to swamp the Echelon network with subversive e-mails.
In that incident, Internet users from around the world launched an e- mail campaign against the NSA in an attempt to flood the agency's alleged computer surveillance system.
Reports of the time suggested that the protesters were upset at NSA's apparent scanning of e-mails in an attempt to identify potential terrorists. In the United States, a recent CBS-TV report on the show 60 Minutes reported that the system may have been used to spy on the phone conversations of the late Princess Diana, at a time when she was spearheading an effort to ban landmines worldwide.
Echelon's existence has been discussed in security circles for almost a decade, but its existence was only brought to public attention in early 1997 by Covert Action Quarterly (CAQ), a quarterly intelligence newsletter, which revealed details of the global telecommunications surveillance system.
According to the newsletter, Echelon is a top secret alliance involving the NSA's telecoms surveillance system and other government networks that allows the bulk of the civilized world's telephone calls to be digitized and analyzed using intelligent text searching technology.
CAQ said that Echelon monitors virtually all phone calls in the U.S. And Europe, including the UK, effectively making a mockery of the UK's Interception of Communications Act.
The newsletter added that Echelon is used to keyword search e-mail, fax, telex and all types of voice communications, including analog and digital cellular phone calls.
"Unlike many of the electronic spy systems developed during the Cold War, Echelon is designed primarily for non-military targets: governments, organizations, businesses, and individuals in virtually every country. It potentially affects every person communicating between (and sometimes within) countries anywhere in the world," the newsletter The newsletter added that the existence of Echelon was inadvertently revealed by the New Zealand government, which joined the Echelon network in the 1960s.
The four other main members of Echelon are the U.S.' NSA, the UK's GCHQ, Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD).
The newsletter said that Echelon started life as a UK-U.S. government co-operative initiative in the Second World War. After the war, the agreement was formalized in 1948, when the UK and the U.S. agreed to tackle intelligence gathering against the USSR.
Central to Echelon are the Echelon dictionaries, which are compiled by the five main members' intelligence agencies. Each intelligence agency holds copies of all of the other members' dictionaries, which contain details of keywords that the respective intelligence agency is interested in.
Each agency's computer system scans all available telecoms and data traffic in its region. Where another agency's keyword is found in the digital data stream, the relevant text or data is automatically forwarded to the appropriate agency's computer system. This means, the newsletter said, that the originating agency's staff never get to see the relevant data - only the agency with the appropriate keyword receives the transmission.
CAQ claims that the relevant agencies' headquarters processing Echelon data surveillance files are located in Washington, Ottawa, Cheltenham, Canberra, and Wellington.

Electronic Form of 'Invisible Ink'
Inside Files May Reveal Secrets
By MICHAEL J. MCCARTHY
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
ST. PAUL, Minn. -- For weeks this summer, Mike Ciresi's campaign staff was baffled by a strange series of e-mail messages slamming the U.S. Senate candidate.
Sent to Minnesota Democratic Party officials, the messages were signed by a Katie Stevens. But after a failed attempt to track her down, Mr. Ciresi's staff began to suspect foul play.
The first e-mail, which arrived in May, impugned the candidate's ethics and those of his Minneapolis law firm. It was accompanied by six pages of court cases, citations and footnotes. The attachments convinced Mr. Ciresi's staff that the e-mail was part of a well-funded "opposition research" effort. But two months and three negative e-mails later, his staff still had nothing to go on. Then in July, one tenacious Ciresi aide, playing a hunch, made a few mouse clicks and uncovered an intriguing clue: hidden text that seemed to link the e-mail to the campaign of the Republican incumbent.
Tracking the Metadata
It turns out there's more than meets the eye in the average word-processing document. A typical Microsoft Word file, for example, can include the author's name, the name of his or her company, the names of each person who has worked on the document and, depending on the options selected, deleted text and other revisions, all hidden from view, as if written in invisible ink. That's because Word, the dominant word-processing software, contains a lot of what Microsoft Corp. calls "metadata," information that doesn't appear on a user's screen simply because commands in the file tell computer monitors and printers to ignore it.
But a savvy reader can peek at much of this behind-the-scenes fiddling by using widely available text-reader programs, such as Notepad, or by simply selecting the right word-processing options. Sometimes, depending on a computer's settings, Word revisions that weren't at all visible to the writer are obvious to the recipient. And when those documents get zapped through cyberspace as e-mail attachments, the inside information they contain can set the sender up for embarrassment or worse.
'Highlight Changes'
One such e-mail snafu in Seattle sent both parties scrambling for fixes. In late 1998, Payne Consulting Group received an e-mail that included an attached contract prepared for it by its law firm, Davis Wright Tremaine. By clicking on the "highlight changes" option, Payne and the law firm say, Payne could clearly see revisions that revealed the contract had originally been drafted for another Davis Wright client.
The law firm quickly devised security procedures for removing hidden text from its files. Payne, meanwhile, developed a free program called Metadata Assistant to purge any unseen, unwanted information from documents. The program can be downloaded from the firm's Web site,  ( One reason Payne doesn't charge for it: "We can't guarantee everything is stripped out," says Robert Affleck, vice president of development.
"The big concern is that people are sending around things they don't know they're sending around," says Steve McDonald, associate legal counsel at Ohio State University, who teaches a class in cyberspace Microsoft has "gotten few customer complaints" about the problem, says Lisa Gurry, a product manager for Microsoft Office. But she adds that those will be addressed in late spring in the next version of Microsoft Office, which will include a "privacy option" to allow a Word document's author to "remove all personal information with the click of one button and be warned if you're saving tracked changes and comments." For now, Microsoft offers a nine-page article through its Web site on "How to Minimize Metadata in Microsoft Word Documents."
It was this kind of data that gave Ciresi campaign aides the first break in their investigation of the e-mails plaguing their candidate. The first in the series, titled "Who Is Michael Ciresi?", arrived May 19. It described the clients of law firm Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi as "a rogues' gallery of polluters, price fixers, tortfeasors, predators, civil-rights violators and frauds." A second searing e-mail arrived just before Minnesota Democrats convened in early June to endorse a candidate in the state's senatorial race. A third followed. Then, a fourth.
"I was getting so frustrated trying to figure out where these came from," recalls Mark Hinds, the campaign's deputy field director.
But as he sat thinking at his desk in the Democratic Party's offices here in early July, a light bulb clicked on. Mr. Hinds suddenly recalled how at a previous job he used to sort Word documents by using keywords and names in the program's "properties" box. With that in mind, he clicked on the Word attachment to the fourth and latest e-mail, OIL SPILL LOBBYISTS.doc. The properties box, which he found by using Word's file menu, instantly showed that the document was created July 8 and was "Last Saved by: Chris Gunhus." His thoughts immediately turned to Christine Gunhus, the political director and former chief of staff for Sen. Rod Grams, the Republican Mr. Ciresi had been hoping to unseat.
"Come here, you gotta see this," Mr. Hinds says he called out to fellow campaign workers, who gathered around his computer. They started searching through the previous e-mails. The first one said "Last Saved by: Kinko's Customer" and listed "gunhus" as the author. They found other names and more dates and times that the documents had been created and stored.
The Ciresi campaign alerted local authorities to its discoveries, which were first reported by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The campaign alleged that the masquerade wasn't just a political dirty trick but a possible misdemeanor. A Minnesota law, which was designed to discourage anonymous attacks on politicians, requires those involved in election campaigns to disclose that fact in any political literature they prepare or distribute. The law exempts individuals who spend less than $300 on their activities and observe certain other limits.
By late August, the Anoka County attorney's office had amassed enough evidence to persuade a judge to let it seize two computers and nine computer disks from Ms. Gunhus's Ham Lake, Minn., home.
Asked if Ms. Gunhus was involved in writing or editing any of the e-mails under investigation, Doug Kelley, her attorney, wouldn't comment. "In the long run," he says, "she will be found not to have violated any laws." Ms. Gunhus declined to be interviewed.
Sen. Grams's campaign denies that it produced or authorized the e-mails. But after discovering the names tucked deep inside the e-mail messages, Bob Decheine, the Ciresi campaign manager, believes otherwise. "We think we have found a smoking gun," he says.
County investigators, however, proceeded carefully, after learning that anyone could easily have framed Ms. Gunhus by entering her name in the properties box. "I could put in that 'William Shakespeare' is the author," says Bryan Lindberg, the assistant attorney leading the But then, Mr. Lindberg says, his team uncovered a more substantive link. Subpoenaed phone and Internet-access records linked the "Katie Stevens" Hotmail account used to send the attack e-mails to a Kinko's document-processing center and a phone line listed as belonging to Ms. Gunhus's home, according to an affidavit filed by the county attorney's office as part of its search-warrant request. "The telephone number back to the Gunhus residence in Ham Lake gave us the probable cause to look at her computers," Mr. Lindberg says.
Mr. Ciresi lost his state's Democratic primary last month. The investigation into the e-mail messages continues.

they had logs of all URLs you visited when clicking on

That this violates their own privacy policy.

ZKS and Anonymizer have the wrong business model in terms
of what consumers want. They're too techie. What people
(as opposed to cypherpunks ;-) want is privacy AND the
ability to make purchases without spreading their CC#
all over.
This is the hottest area of privacy services, and
competition is starting to heat up, with more and
more firms deciding to provide such services.
Card issuers would seem to have an advantage here.
An early "release" (can you say 'vaporware') is
being promoted in TV commercials by American Express.
The commercial shows the narrator/consumer talking
about wanting Internet privacy, while his face is
obscured the entire commercial. The ending has him
claiming complete Internet privacy, including for
purchases, and shows a symbolic AmEx card with the name X'd out.
("I'm finally getting the recognition I deserve.")
AmEx signed an agreement on 9/7/2000 with Privada to
provide the proxying Internet access, and AmEx says
it will roll out Privacy Payments within the next month.

    Introducing a suite of exciting online privacy
    initiatives from American Express.
American Express has always helped our Cardmembers enjoy the recognition they deserve. But there are places where you may want to reveal less about yourself, such as the Internet. American Express has a long history of protecting consumer privacy, and we're committed to continuing this tradition online.
That's why we're introducing a range of new products and services to provide additional security for our customers when they are shopping or browsing on the Internet. The first product, Private PaymentsSM will be available soon, followed by Private Browsing later this year and additional offerings in 2001.
    Private Payments - An Innovative Online Payment Solution

Private Payments is an industry breakthrough for secure purchasing online. This new way to pay creates a random, unique number for each online purchase. Customers never transmit their actual card number over the Internet, thus ensuring their Card?s security. This service is free to U.S. American Express Consumer Cardmembers and Small Business Cardmembers. It is not available to corporate Cardmembers at this time.

American Express has recently partnered with Privada Inc. a leading digital privacy infrastructure provider, to create Private Browsing. This exciting software product will enable American Express Cardmembers to choose how much information is shared about them when they browse the Web-from their full identity to anonymity. It will be available later this year.
First Product in Series Provides Innovative Way to Pay Online: Unique, Random Number Safeguards Customers and Helps Reduce Fraud
NEW YORK, September 7, 2000 -- Addressing consumer concerns about online privacy and security, American Express Company today announced a new series of products that provides customers with greater choice and protection when browsing and shopping online. The first product, known as Private PaymentsSM, is an industry breakthrough that offers a more secure way to pay online using a random, unique number for each online purchase. Private Payments enables customers to purchase online without transmitting their actual card account numbers over the Internet. Private Payments will be available free within the next month to American Express consumer and small business cardmembers in the United The company has also signed an agreement with and made a minority investment in Privada Inc., a digital privacy infrastructure provider, to deliver a second product that will enable customers to choose how much of their information is shared when they browse any site on the Web. This private browsing product will allow customers to select from settings that range from sharing their full identity to anonymity. This service will be introduced later this year. Additional offerings in the new suite of American Express products will be announced next "While the Internet has dramatically eased the way consumers research and purchase products, it also has increased concern for protecting privacy and security," said Alfred F. Kelly, Jr., group president of U.S. Consumer and Small Business Services at American Express.
How Private Payments Works
Using Private Payments to shop online is quick and easy. Interested cardmembers can register for the free service here. When cardmembers are ready to purchase online, they can access the service by going to the Private Payments home page at americanexpress.com or by clicking on the Private Payments icon on their desktop. This launches the service, which then prompts them for username and password, and to select the American Express. Card they want linked to the Private Payments number. A unique Private Payments number with expiration date is then randomly created by American Express. The cardmember transfers this information into the merchant order form to complete the purchase. The cardmember's actual card account number is not sent over the Internet, thus keeping this information secure. The item purchased is charged to the cardmember's selected American Express Card and appears on the monthly billing statement, as usual.
Further safeguarding the online purchase, the Private Payments number is designed to be used for a single purchase and to expire after the merchant authorization process is completed. Upon expiration, the Private Payments number cannot be used again if stolen.

#    April 2, 2001 #    Microsoft Urges Global Attack
#    Against Piracy of Software
#    #    To combat such piracy, Microsoft recently entered into a formal #    partnership with the U.S. Customs Service to exchange information #    on intellectual-property crimes around the world. The agency #    has similar partnerships with other companies and trade #    associations, including Underwriters Laboratories and the Motion #    Picture Association of America.
#    #    The partnership is a formalized cooperation process where #    information is exchanged regularly, according to Customs spokesman #    Dennis Murphy. "These partnership agreements have become an #    effective way for us to get better information and do a better #    enforcement job, as well as a way for the company to get a more #    effective means to police their copyrights," Mr. Murphy said.
#    #    Microsoft also has aggressively recruited its own security force #    of former government agents led by Richard LaMagna, a 27-year #    veteran of the Drug Enforcement Administration who speaks #    Cantonese, Mandarin, French and Thai. During the past six months, #    Microsoft officials say, the company has taken legal action #    against 47,000 dubious or illegal postings on the Internet #    offering its products.
#    #    The Customs Service, through its network of attaches around the #    world, helps Microsoft and other companies work with foreign #    police agencies. In conjunction with the Federal Bureau of #    Investigation, the agency last year inaugurated a new Intellectual #    Property Rights Center in Washington to serve as a command center #    for operations against copyright violators.
#    #    The stepped-up antipiracy efforts reflect new concern about an #    old problem for software makers. "As we've seen organized criminal #    enterprises focusing on counterfeiting and taking it to the #    Internet, it is becoming an even more important problem for the #    industry and the company," Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Brad #    Smith said.
#    #    Counterfeiters, many in Asia, have recently shifted distribution #    networks onto the Web, which provides a host of benefits, #    including anonymity.
#    #    In addition to Latin America, Microsoft says recent seizures #    have taken place in Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, the Philippines, #    the People's Republic of China, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, #    the United Kingdom, Romania, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Canada #    and the U.S.

#    All Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and any other users who administer Unix
#    machines at their home or in their workplace please take note:
#    #    The xntpd and ntpd daemons, which are used for synchronizing time between
#    multiple machines over a network, have a security vulnerability that
#    allows remote attackers to gain root access.
#    #    If you are using NTP on your Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or any other
#    Unix-ish operating system which you keep connected to the Internet
#    on a regular basis, you should shut down the NTP daemon now and
#    examine your machine for evidence of a remote attack.  We have already
#    received one report from a Panix customer who was probed Thursday night/
#    Friday morning.
#    #    Users with commercial vendor versions of Unix (i.e. Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,
#    etc) should contact their vendor for more information to find out if
#    they are affected (I suspect they are, though it will take a while before
#    someone puts together an exploit).  In the meantime, you should stop
#    running xntpd/ntpd until your vendor addresses the problem.

#    #    April 11, 2001 #    #    An Anticopyright Activist Gets Funding For a Start-Up That Makes #    … Software
#    #    By LEE GOMES Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    An Irish computer programmer known for crusading against copyright #    and other "intellectual property" laws has received $4 million #    from Intel Corp. and others to start a for-profit, proprietary #    company based on his software.
#    #    Ian Clark, the 24-year-old author of a software program called #    FreeNet, is also a co-founder of Uprizer Inc., a Los Angeles #    start-up that Wednesday is scheduled to announce the investment #    from Intel and two venture-capital firms.
#    #    Mr. Clark is something of a hero, as well as a frequent speaker #    and panelist, in the small segment of the computer world that #    holds little respect for copyright or similar intellectual-pr
#    operty laws. In interviews, Mr. Clark has said that one day #    copyright laws will be regarded the way society now regards #    witch-burning.
#    #    His FreeNet program is a file-transfer program that is similar #    to Napster, Gnutella and other file-sharing systems. Like #    Gnutella, FreeNet is completely decentralized and operates without #    the need for a central server controlling its operations. But #    FreeNet (freenet.sourceforge.net/)goes an extra step in that #    the files that are passed around with FreeNet are encrypted, #    or scrambled, in a way that makes it impossible for outsiders #    to see what is being passed around on the network.
#    #    While FreeNet has received extensive publicity in the past year, #    partly because of the interest in Napster, it has far fewer actual #    users than does software based on Gnutella or Napster. FreeNet #    users have complained that the software is an inefficient system, #    in part because of the large amount of computer resources expended #    in keeping data encrypted and private.
#    #    Mr. Clark's company, Uprizer, will be creating software based #    on FreeNet. But despite his somewhat novel ideas about copyright #    laws, Uprizer will be selling traditional proprietary software.
#    #    Uprizer said Mr. Clark wasn't available to discuss Uprizer. But #    Rob Kramer, the Uprizer co-founder who will be its chief #    executive, maintained that Uprizer and FreeNet aren't related #    to each other. "Ian is a very smart person who has other goals #    in his life, and Uprizer is one of them," Mr. Kramer said.
#    #    Mr. Kramer said Uprizer will be selling software that will allow #    computer users, such as people inside companies, to exchange #    information and files with each other. Mr. Kramer said Uprizer #    will be using technology built into FreeNet that automatically #    brings files close to the groups of people wanting them. He said, #    though, that Uprizer's product won't have the anonymity and #    encryption that is built into FreeNet.
#    #    Uprizer is another company in what is being called "peer-to-peer" #    computing, a catch-all phrase that is used to describe a number #    of different ways that computers are being linked to perform #    common tasks.

Creator of Smiley Face icon dies at 79
By Associated Press, 04/13/01
WORCESTER -- Harvey R. Ball, whose simple drawing of a smiling face on a yellow background became a cultural icon, died Thursday after a short illness. He was 79.
Ball, who co-owned an advertising and public relations firm in Worcester, designed the Smiley Face in 1963 to boost the morale of workers in two recently merged insurance companies.
Ball was paid $45 for his artwork by State Mutual Life Assurance Cos. of America -- now Allamerica -- in 1963.
He never applied for a trademark or copyright, something his son, Charles Ball, said his father never regretted.
"He was not a money-driven guy," Charles Ball told the Telegram and Gazette of Worcester. "He used to say, `Hey, I can only eat one steak at a time, drive one car at a time."'
Bush virtual pet game popularity soars in China
By D. Ian Hopper, Associated Press, 04/13/01
WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of the downed U.S. spy plane, the Chinese apparently have found a new way to ridicule President Bush -- a virtual pet modeled after him.
While the U.S.-made PortaBush software for handheld computers wasn't released with much fanfare last week, it became a big hit in China very quickly.
The software's American designers noticed a huge traffic spike Thursday coming from China, at one point reaching about 2,000 downloads in an hour and threatening to overwhelm their servers.
"About 80 percent of the downloads were coming from China," Eruptor Entertainment President Brad Foxhoven said Friday. "We just got too much traffic in such a short period of time that wasn't letting up."
Released a week ago by Marina Del Ray, Calif.-based Eruptor Entertainment, the software toy is similar to the faded Tamagotchi craze. Players feed their PortaBush, keep him happy and help him make vital national decisions like whether to bomb teen singer Britney Spears.

April 13, 2001
    Bush's Medical-Privacy Act Is Part of a Wider Strategy
    More broadly, the Bush mindset on privacy could have significant     consequences for a variety of businesses.
    For instance, in a little-noticed comment Mr. Bush made to ZDNet,     an Internet news service, shortly before becoming president,     he declared: "As president, I will prohibit genetic discrimin-
    ation, criminalize identity theft, and guarantee the privacy     of medical and sensitive financial records. In addition, I will     make it a criminal offense to sell a person's Social Security     number without his or her express consent."
    This is bad news for companies that specialize in selling,     obtaining, or trading personal data. Congress this year is     expected to consider legislation that restricts sales of Social     Security numbers. Also, lawmakers anticipate debating a host     of Internet-related privacy matters, including new limits on     unsolicited e-mails and new rules on data collected by Web sites.     "Companies, before they use your or my information, must give     you a buy-in, must seek your information in a positive way,"     Mr. Bush told The Wall Street Journal last year.
    Certainly his stand on medical-records privacy surprised and     delighted consumer and privacy advocates. "We are greatly     encouraged that we have cleared the first major hurdle," said     Janlori Goldman, director of the Health Privacy Project at     Georgetown University.
    But industry officials were dismayed. Scott Serota, president     of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, called the rules     "an operational nightmare," and said that two years were too     short a period for the industry to reach compliance. The American     Hospital Association said it was "profoundly disappointed" by     the president's decision. The Federation of American Hospitals     said the rules, in their current form, were "unworkable."

After Complaints, Yahoo to Close Access to Pornographic Sites
Faced with a flood of criticism from users, Yahoo, the vast Internet service, reversed a longstanding policy and said yesterday that it would remove a wide range of pornographic material from its site and make other such information harder to find.
The company also said it was moving to restrict what it termed "inappropriate material" from home pages created by its members of its Geocities service. Yahoo said it would make it more difficult to use its popular search engine to find listings for pornographic Web sites.
Yahoo's online shopping area had links to about 100 Internet stores selling pornographic videotapes and DVD's. As in all sections of Yahoo's shopping area, merchants pay a commission of 2 percent of their sales. To get to the adult area, users needed to verify that they were above 18 by entering a valid credit card number.
Many of the e-mail messages complaining about Yahoo were prompted by a campaign by a coalition of anti- pornography groups led by the American Family Association of Tupelo, Miss., according to Donna Rice Hughes, an anti-pornography advocate and member of the coalition. Yesterday, Ms. Hughes praised Yahoo's move.
"The good news is that after the backlash they received that they have chosen to reverse their decision to sell pornography," Ms. Hughes said. "But I would like to see them go further." She pointed to home pages and chat rooms that have pornographic Jeffery Douglas, the chairman of the Free Speech Coalition, the trade association of the pornography industry, called Yahoo's move an "overreaction."
"There is nothing illegal, wrong or fattening about purchasing routine adult material made for and by consenting adults," he He said that the Internet was a particularly appropriate medium for the distribution of sexually related material as consumers risk neither offending nor being embarrassed by others who might otherwise observe, say, rentals of pornographic tapes in a local video store.
"The Internet allows people to explore their own sexuality and their own fantasies without hurting or intruding on anyone," he said.

Heh-heh-heh: a FoxNewsChannel viewer suggests it
would be appropriate for us to bomb our own plane.
Motion seconded! Oh, to see the look of surprise
on their faces.
If any Chinese gets killed, we apologize. ;-)
That'll send a message to the bastards.
Don't mess with Texas.
What's all this angst about "the Feds" monitoring this list?
They've nailed a couple of mental defectives!
Last time they did that, irs.gov mailed in a [razzing] news
release to this list...
What a bunch of losers, nailing (rather than helping) people
with mental problems, then gloating about it.
It is them getting exposed. How about that Jeff Gordon being
both "victim" and prosecutor? It demonstrates this is a vendetta
by Gordon, that power corrupts. It is the Feds who went under
intense scrutiny for their effort to persecute mental defectives.
BTW, if anyone has pictures of The Gordon, please email
them to me. I'll put him up at Orwellian.Org. Him attending
the trial would be appropriate.

Well, if no one has a picture of The Gordon, maybe I can
just make one up as symbolic. If someone does want to mail
me one, do not make it an attachment because I don't pop
them down, and I delete the emails after the download.
Include it in-line. Also, I can hand concatenate data
that you split because of remailer limitations.
I don't know when and if I'll get around to it, but putting
up a picture of The Gordon would be, as John Young put it,
for purposes of ridicule.
So, let's take an image I mentioned earlier: Jeff Gordon
fucking himself with his own gun.
As you know, "parody" is legal. What you might not have
seen was in Hustler within the past few months: a parody
of Jenna Bush, with a clear photo of her pretty head/hair
grafted (fairly well) onto a nekked model's body, and
Jenna was fucking herself with a dildo.
Alrighty then.
The title: "Parody of tough guy Jeff Gordon, Federal Agent and cypherpunk"
Text in picture: "I'm so tough I fuck myself with my own gun!"
Then a PhotoShop creation.
None of which is meant to stalk, intimidate or threaten The Gordon.
Just ridicule.
Which brings up something interesting: The Gordon reading this.
If he, his legal mouthpiece, or any other Fed thinks this
Jeff Gordon parody would be in any way _illegal_, say so, to
the list, from a .gov address.
Failure to object will be held against you in any possible
future court action. Including ones initiated by me, if I
find out you lifted a finger to collect any intelligence
on me, or instigated someone else to do so. I would consider
that the equivalent of, say, an IRS employee (which I know
he's not any longer) looking up tax returns of people they
had no business snooping on. The IRS now fires such people.
Better check with your lawyer.
Most Federal employees and agents are fine people.
The ones that aren't need attention. Tim May might say
they need killing, but that's his silly schtick. That
and blacknet might get him scrutiny, but not any action.
Newt Gingrich put it this way: "We must closely scrutinize
those we lend power to."
Just don't be taking mail out of people's mailboxes, okay?
And if anyone is following John Young in a car, it's just
to razz him into making paramoid statements. After all,
John _sometimes_ sounds like he's going batty.
Bless his pointed little architected head.

Pull up the URL for the full article.
#    #    Ashcroft to Christian Crowd: Use Government to Sell Jesus
#    #    The Gospel According to the A.G.
#    #    by Ward Harkavy
#    #    In a speech that never surfaced during his confirmation hearing #    but reveals much about his agenda as attorney general, John #    Ashcroft clearly laid out his dream of government-sponsored social #    programs helping convert people to Jesus. Behind the scenes, #    his Justice Department is now helping make that possible.
#    #    Government "gives only half a gift when it doesn't give the spirit #    of Christ," Ashcroft, then a Missouri senator, told the dinner #    crowd at the Washington Court Hotel on September 18, 1996, as #    he received the Christian Statesman of the Year Award. "It doesn't #    give the spirit of God, it doesn't give the spirit of forgiveness, #    it doesn't give the regeneration of healing with its gift."
#    #    Those sentiments, captured on tape and obtained by the Voice, #    don't surprise Ashcroft's critics. "That is a statement saying #    the government must evangelize," said Barry Lynn, the liberal #    minister who's the head of Americans United for Separation of #    Church and State. "He views the goal of a politician to be an #    active agent of religious conversion."
#    #    What threw Lynn and others was Ashcroft's insistence during the #    Senate hearings last January that he could keep his well-known #    religious beliefs from affecting his performance as the nation's #    top law enforcement officer. "In the past, unlike during the #    confirmation hearings, he couldn't separate the secular from #    the religious," said Lynn. "He never even suggested that he could. #    And I couldn't believe him when he told the Senate that he could."
#    #    For good reason.

#    #    Two New Peer-to-Peer Programs Aim High, but Still Have Glitches
#    #    By JEREMY WAGSTAFF Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    Time to grovel. I was hoping this week to be able to trumpet #    a bunch of new programs that free you from some of the physical #    constraints of modern computing. I was hoping to be able to say #    that, at last, you were free of shackles such as overprotective #    technical staff, the corporate Intranet and endless e-mail #    attachments.
#    #    But paradise, I'm afraid to say, has to be postponed for a while. #    The two programs I've been toying with, new versions of which #    were both released last week, are Groove Networks Inc.'s Groove #    ( ) and GoToMyPC ( ) from #    Expertcity Inc.
#    #    Groove is the first serious attempt to introduce peer-to-peer #    computing to the business marketplace, giving employees a chance #    to communicate and share files by setting up their own online #    work groups. GoToMyPC offers the first Web-based -- and legal #    -- method of accessing and controlling another computer. Both, #    in theory, are great ideas, elegant in their simplicity and #    genuinely useful. But neither worked perfectly.
#    #    Peer-to-peer computing -- where multiple users can interact #    directly, rather than through a server -- is probably the next #    great thing for the Internet. Best known as a way to swap music #    over the Net via Napster, so-called P-to-P applications allow #    much more, such as letting users share files, messages or #    calendars, or collaborate in real time on a document or drawing.
#    #    As I've mentioned before, the Web will start coming into its #    own once people stop obsessing about how to make money out of #    other users and start capitalizing on the intrinsic benefits #    of having millions of people all sharing a network.
#    #    Peer-to-peer computing offers users the chance to set up their #    own personalized networks atop the public Web. Without these #    P-to-P systems, people have to use a number of imperfect #    alternatives. For instance, users can rely on their Internet-
#    service providers to provide the tools (but they may be held #    hostage to proprietary programs or HTML); or use corporate #    networks (jealously guarded by techies rightly afraid of viruses #    and other abuses); or shuffle e-mail messages among team members #    (a cumbersome process).
#    #    In practice, Groove isn't quite mature yet. The preview edition #    looks and feels professional, and carries loads of useful #    features, including instant messaging, file sharing, even a #    doodling pad. It also supposedly works behind a firewall, and #    around problems such as connecting to computers that share the #    same Internet connection.
#    #    Although the program is sturdier than its beta ancestors, I found #    it unstable and unreliable. On one computer it wouldn't load #    properly; on another it behaved erratically through the company #    firewall and offered no easily accessible options that I could #    tweak to make it perform better.
#    #    Disappointing, but not fatal. Groove, or something like it, is #    definitely the wave of the future: Freeing up employees to set #    up their own peer groups without cluttering the corporate Intranet #    makes sense. Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, for one, #    agrees: Last week it bought 10,000 licenses for more than 100,000 #    employees world-wide, making it Groove Networks' first paying #    customer.
#    #    GoToMyPC, meanwhile, tackles a similar problem from a slightly #    different angle, and is a unilateral peer-to-peer system, rather #    than the more common variety that lets anyone talk to anyone #    else. Whether on the Net or not, users have been hamstrung by #    the fact that generally they only can run one computer at a time. #    Working from home? Chances are you only can access the office #    network with difficulty. Forget a vital file at home? There are #    only one or two programs available that allow you to access a #    remote computer, and most of them aren't Internet-based. Instead, #    these programs rely on actually dialing into the computer via #    a phone line.
#    #    GoToMyPC aims to make the process simpler by harnessing the #    Internet to link computers. It sounds simple, and it is: Assuming #    the two computers are connected to the Internet (and most office #    computers permanently are hooked up, as are PCs on a cable modem #    or other high-speed Internet connection), the software merely #    links them together. It establishes a digital handshake between #    the two computers and makes sure the connection is secure from #    prying eyes. That in a nutshell is how GoToMyPC works.
#    #    Once again, in theory, this sounds good. The number of times #    I've left important files in the office, or at home, doesn't #    bear thinking about. To be able to fire up an Internet connection #    -- any-where, anytime, since the software is simple to install #    and not limited to any particular host PC -- and access your #    data and programs is a very appealing idea.
#    #    In practice, of course, there are problems. One is security. #    If you can get into the computer, chances are some ne'er-do-well #    can too, whatever levels of security Expertcity applies (and #    there are plenty of them). That's why a lot of people disconnect #    their computers from the Internet when they aren't around, even #    if they're paying for a 24-hour connection (and if you don't #    you should seriously consider doing so).
#    #    The other problem may perhaps be due to my own dumbness and the #    slowness of my connection but I couldn't get my two computers #    to talk to each other at all. What's more, the software didn't #    appear smart enough to know it already was loaded, so it would #    go through this song-and-dance routine of installing fresh widgets #    every time I tried to establish a connection. In the end it would #    have been quicker for me to have gotten a taxi, caught the #    afternoon shuttle flight, walked home from the airport and grabbed #    the files myself.
#    #    Finally, I'm not sure system administrators are going to be that #    happy about allowing this kind of thing on their networks. Indeed, #    Expertcity appears aware of this and offers a template for an #    e-mail message you can send to your system administrator. Knowing #    a few of these guys myself, it sounds a bit optimistic.
#    #    Both of these programs are worth trying out -- they're free, #    at least for the moment -- as long as you've got a good Internet #    connection and you don't mind tinkering with glitchy software. #    I'm not going to get too excited about them for now, but one #    day we may all be wondering how we lived without them.

#    #    Report: Terrorists Using Internet to Plot Moves
#    #    ARLINGTON, Va. - Usama Bin Laden and other Muslim extremists #    are using the Internet to plan terrorist activities against the #    United States and its allies, USA Today reported Tuesday.
#    #    The paper said weeks of interviews with U.S. law enforcement #    officials and other experts disclosed details of how extremists #    hide maps and photographs of terrorist targets in sports chat #    rooms, on pornographic bulletin boards and other popular Web #    sites.
#    #    The report said instructions for terrorist activities also are #    posted on the sites, which the officials declined to name.
#    #    "To a greater and greater degree, terrorist groups, including #    Hezbollah, Hamas and Bin Laden's al Qaida group, are using #    computerized files, e-mail and encryption to support their #    operations," CIA Director George Tenet wrote last March to the #    Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
#    #    USA Today said the testimony was presented at a closed-door #    hearing and made public later.
#    #    Following up on that report, the paper said it learned from #    various unnamed officials and investigators that the messages #    are scrambled using free encryption programs set up by groups #    that advocate privacy on the Internet.
#    #    "It's something the intelligence, law-enforcement and military #    communities are really struggling to deal with," Ben Venzke of #    the cyberintelligence company iDEFENSE told the paper.
#    #    "The operational details and future targets, in many cases, are #    hidden in plain view on the Internet. Only the members of the #    terrorist organizations, knowing the hidden signals, are able #    to extract the information."

#    #    Small Start-Up Helps the CIA
#    To Mask Its Moves on the Web
#    #    By NEIL KING JR.
#    Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    How's this for a curious pairing? Stephen Hsu and his partners #    at SafeWeb Inc. launch a Web site ( offering #    the utmost in Internet privacy -- and then hook up with the #    notoriously intrusive Central Intelligence Agency.
#    #    The new alliance between the Oakland, Calif., entrepreneurs and #    the spooks from Langley, Va., shows how serious the CIA is about #    improving its spycraft. The agency two years ago set up its own #    venture-capital firm, known as In-Q-Tel, to search out just the #    sort of innovations that SafeWeb offers.
#    #    The CIA, in this case, wants to use a SafeWeb program to mask #    its own movements on the Internet, so it can gather information #    incognito. SafeWeb suggests that the CIA also might use its #    technology to allow its far-flung agents and informants to #    communicate home, without the countries they are spying on ever #    knowing.
#    #    What's puzzling is why a tiny, year-old start-up would want to #    link up with an agency that is the nemesis of privacy buffs #    everywhere.
#    #    "I'm sure we'll take a hit from the 5% of our most paranoid #    customers," says Mr. Hsu, SafeWeb's 34-year-old co-founder and #    a theoretical physicist by training. But the CIA connection, #    he says, is deliberately distant. SafeWeb will provide the agency #    with customized software, but the CIA will have no access to #    the company's Web computers or to the workings of its core #    software, he insists.
#    #    And who better to test the power of its privacy software than #    the world's top spies? "If our technology can satisfy them," #    Mr. Hsu says, "it can satisfy just about anyone."
#    #    The technology is a clever piece of software called Triangle #    Boy that SafeWeb plans to post free this month on the Web. The #    CIA, through In-Q-Tel, is investing in a revved-up version of #    the software, which can bounce digital traffic around the Web #    anonymously, as well as rights to an equity stake in SafeWeb #    should the company go public. Neither side will disclose financial #    details.
#    #    The CIA has been slow to mine the riches of the Internet for #    fear of exposing its own vast computer network to viruses or #    hacker attacks. It also worries that others will monitor its #    activities if it roams the Web without proper disguise.
#    #    What SafeWeb offers is a chance to move about the Internet without #    leaving any trace. Users simply go to the company's Web site #    and type in the address of the actual site they are seeking. #    SafeWeb's site acts as an intermediary; anyone monitoring the #    activity would see only the traffic between the user's computer #    and SafeWeb -- and not the user's ultimate destination. The site #    recorded more than one million unique visits last month.
#    #    But what really caught the CIA's fancy was Triangle Boy, a #    software package that can turn any personal computer into a #    surrogate Web server. The system allows users to navigate to #    any number of innocuous PC addresses, and then go to the actual #    Web site they are seeking -- without leaving a trace. Triangle #    Boy works by forwarding the request for the desired Web site #    on to SafeWeb's site, which then makes the connection. SafeWeb #    developed Triangle Boy to deter companies or countries from #    blocking access to its site, as Saudi Arabia did last November.
#    #    CIA specialists say their core interest in Triangle Boy is #    anonymous Internet browsing. "We want to operate anywhere on #    the Internet in a way that no one knows the CIA is looking at #    them," says a senior CIA official with connections to the In-Q-Tel #    team.
#    #    But the possible uses go way beyond that. SafeWeb says the agency #    also could use the technology as a secure way for its "assets," #    or contacts, to communicate with CIA headquarters. The CIA also #    suggests that it may one day build a global network made up of #    Triangle Boys and servers equipped with SafeWeb-style software #    to communicate with employees and informants. CIA Director George #    Tenet told the Senate last week that one of his chief ambitions #    is "to take modern Web-based technology and apply it to our #    business relentlessly."
#    #    The SafeWeb technology could prove just as handy in getting #    information covertly into other countries. It was this application #    that originally inspired Mr. Hsu to reach out to the CIA last #    summer. "I imagined them wanting to use Triangle Boy to get Voice #    of America or something like that into countries where it was #    blocked," he said.
#    #    Others suggest more devious possibilities. An application like #    Triangle Boy, if scattered among hundreds of PCs, could be a #    way to cloak a multipronged "cyber attack" on someone else's #    computer system. The CIA, along with the Pentagon, has worked #    for years to perfect ways to electronically meddle with other #    countries' banking systems or electricity grids, and Triangle #    Boy could allow them to do it without the target ever knowing #    who was behind the attack. "It would be the functional equivalent #    of an electronic silencer," says one technology expert with wide #    experience in the intelligence community. "You could shoot #    electronic bullets right down the pipe without anyone knowing #    where they came from." Intelligence officials deny they have #    any interest in using Triangle Boy for offensive attacks.
#    #    The CIA wants the strengthened version of Triangle Boy #    reconfigured so it can handle the CIA's own much higher-powered #    encryption. It also wants to ensure that only its own employees #    and contacts can communicate via Triangle Boy. SafeWeb is expected #    to deliver the customized version by April.
#    #    Some observers suggest that the CIA's real interest is figuring #    out how to crack Triangle Boy and to thwart its use among the #    public. Encryption and the spread of Internet-based communications #    have made life miserable for the National Security Agency, the #    CIA's sister organization responsible for electronic eavesdropping #    around the world. Software such as Triangle Boy will render the #    challenge that much tougher.
#    #    But the CIA denies the allegation.

WSJ.com, 2/16/2001
#    #    Network Solutions Offers Its Database
#    Of Domain-Names to Marketing Firms
#    #    By THOMAS E. WEBER #    Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    The Internet's phone book is up for sale -- and though the #    listings may represent a treasure trove for marketers, the move #    also risks a serious privacy backlash.
#    #    At issue are millions of entries in the domain-name database #    operated by the Network Solutions unit of VeriSign Inc., Mountain #    View, Calif. It is, essentially, the master address book for #    the Internet. Since the dawn of commerce on the Web, companies #    that want their own dot-com addresses have registered with Network #    Solutions.
#    #    Now Network Solutions is selling that information. "On your mark, #    get set, go!" gushes a recent advertisement in a newsletter for #    direct marketers. "Available for the first time ever. #    Approximately 6 million unique customers, sliced and diced for #    you to target prospects, learn about a specific audience or retain #    customers ... Take this information and run with it."
#    #    Exactly what's for sale may come as a surprise to many of the #    individuals and businesses who have registered Web addresses. #    In addition to names, street addresses, and other routine #    information gathered when someone signs up for a domain name, #    Network Solutions promises marketers information on whether sites #    are dormant or up and running, whether they're set up for #    e-commerce -- even whether a site has security precautions #    installed.
#    #    Network Solutions says that while the sales pitch is new, it #    actually has been quietly selling such data for at least a year. #    Now, the company says, it is moving more aggressively to cash #    in on the information. "It's old wine in new bottles," says Doug #    Wolford, general manager for Web presence at VeriSign.
#    #    The move underscores the growing pressure on Internet companies #    to find new sources of revenue. Now that the Net boom has slowed, #    many dot-com companies view customer databases as a tempting #    asset.
#    #    But such strategies can be perilous given consumer concerns about #    privacy online. Last year, online-ad concern DoubleClick Inc. #    was forced to back off a plan to combine Web-tracking data with #    offline databases after the move triggered a firestorm. And when #    online retailer Toysmart.com shut down in May, a plan to sell #    its customer database provoked a similar controversy. Walt Disney #    Co., a Toysmart investor, offered to purchase and then destroy #    the data after the Federal Trade Commission moved to block #    Toysmart's plan.
#    #    The Network Solutions database is a key part of the Internet's #    infrastructure. Internet computers rely on numerical addresses #    to route information around. When someone registers a domain #    name, the information is used to tell computers all over the #    Internet how to translate that dot-com address into the #    appropriate numerical address.
#    #    Registrants also must provide the name, telephone number and #    e-mail address of a technical contact for their site -- #    information that can prove vital for someone trying to trace #    a hacker's attack or verify whether an online business is #    legitimate.
#    #    Under its agreement with the U.S. government to operate the #    database, Network Solutions is required to provide public access #    to the data. Anyone can visit the Network Solutions site and #    look up information on Web addresses one by one. And indeed, #    some marketers -- especially those sending unsolicited "spam" #    e-mail -- have laboriously harvested information this way.
#    #    But for marketing purposes, it's much more useful to have a #    complete set of data outright. Network Solutions offers marketers #    this option -- for a price and under its guidelines, which include #    stripping out e-mail addresses and forbidding the use of the #    information for e-mail marketing.
#    #    Mr. Wolford says the data are typically used by companies that #    want to send direct postal mail to Web businesses or simply want #    to merge the data with existing lists to flesh out customer #    dossiers. Network Solutions also allows its customers to opt #    out of the list and takes steps to insure that only businesses, #    not consumers, are included in the marketing efforts.
#    #    While downplaying any privacy concerns, Network Solutions is #    telling marketers that its data are a great way to sell things, #    especially where small businesses are concerned. "Nobody offers #    a better snapshot of this hard-to-reach group ... over 80% of #    our customers are small businesses, representing every major #    small business category you could hope to reach," proclaims an #    information page at  the site Network Solutions #    uses to promote its data business.
#    #    And the fact remains that it's impossible to obtain a Web address #    without registering for one -- either with Network Solutions #    or with one of the other companies that popped up when the U.S. #    government opened up what had been a Network Solutions monopoly #    on dot-com domain names.
#    #    Consumer advocates say any organized effort to use the data for #    purposes other than the intended goal of obtaining an address #    is troubling. "There's an increasing loss of faith in the ability #    to have your information used only for reasonable, legitimate #    purposes," says Lauren Weinstein, a privacy advocate who writes #    an e-mail newsletter about cyberspace issues. Mr. Weinstein #    alerted his readers to the Network Solutions effort in a bulletin #    this week.
#    #    Registering a domain name is a simple process that can be done #    online in minutes. Network Solutions charges $35 a year for each #    address, and asks for a contact name, phone number and e-mail #    address that go into its database.
#    #    So how does it know whether a site is up and running, or whether #    it is engaged in e-commerce, or any of the other pieces of #    information that it is promising to sell to marketers? Mr. Wolford #    says the company sends software "robots" out onto the Web, using #    much the same method that search engines use to catalog sites. #    Those robots can look for key phrases such as "online ordering" #    or "credit cards accepted" to determine whether a site has #    e-commerce.

#    #    Judge Extends Legal Rights Beyond U.S.
#    #    By BENJAMIN WEISER
#    #    A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that foreign suspects #    who are interrogated abroad by American law enforcement officials #    are entitled to the same Fifth Amendment right against #    self-incrimination as suspects who are questioned in the United #    States.
#    #    The decision, which was unsealed yesterday in Federal District #    Court in Manhattan, is the first to apply the Constitutional #    standard to such interrogations, wrote the judge, Leonard B. #    Sand. It could have a broad impact on the government's #    investigations abroad, particularly in terrorism cases.
#    #    Judge Sand also ruled that the familiar Miranda warnings, which #    are traditionally read to all suspects in the United States, #    must also be administered to foreign suspects who are interrogated #    by American agents abroad.
#    #    #    "What he has done," said H. Richard Uviller, a law professor #    at Columbia University, "is universalized this provision of the #    Bill of Rights."
#    #    Professor Uviller said the decision was "significant insofar #    as it controls the trial of accused foreign terrorists in American #    courts."
#    #    "They are treated almost exactly as if the interrogation had #    taken place at One Police Plaza," the professor said.
#    #    "It's a sound opinion," he added, "on a novel subject justified #    by all of the best authority, as well as good sense."
#    #    The government will not appeal the ruling, said Herbert Hadad, #    a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, #    who refused further comment.
#    #    #    The judge found the question important because of the "increasing #    regularity" with which American law enforcement officials "are #    dispatched and stationed beyond our national borders."

It used to be one had to go into a house to search it.
That takes a search warrant.
Now, technology means you can view things from outside

Thus, this too should need a warrant.

Police snooping needs tight rein says report
01/03/2001 By EUGENE BINGHAM political reporter
Plans to give police and spy agencies the power to hack into computers and intercept electronic communications will lead to unprecedented snooping, the Privacy Commissioner has warned.
In a report calling for limitations to be placed on law enforcement bodies, and greater accountability, Bruce Slane opposes the "pernicious" practice of police hacking into He has recommended that if police are allowed to hack into personal computers, they should need more than a search warrant.
A law change making hacking and other computer snooping illegal except when carried out by the Security Intelligence Service (SIS), the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) or the police is before the law and order select committee.
Associate Justice Minister Paul Swain introduced the legislation in November, saying the agencies needed the powers to battle crime and terrorism.
Mr Slane reported to the Government on the changes before Christmas, welcoming the clamp-down on unauthorised access to computer systems but questioning whether there would be enough controls on state agencies.
"It is easy to think of the interception of communications or the accessing of a computer as affecting only the target of police interest," he wrote.
"However ... many other people [are] affected by interceptions or computer-related searches.
"Trawling or browsing through a myriad of personal information [would be] authorised on an unprecedented scale.
"A single interception warrant can, for instance, authorise listening into hundreds of conversations involving scores of individuals beyond the targeted individuals."
The new law would clear the SIS to carry out a sting on a database once the agency had an interception warrant.
Police would need only a search warrant.
Mr Slane did not believe that a search warrant, issued by a justice of the peace, was strong enough.
"Search warrants are not designed for regulating covert investigations or surveillance," he said.
"Hacking into a person's computer should be, if allowed at all, very much a last resort.
"Search warrants, unlike interception warrants, do not require the intrusive technique to be used only as a last resort."
Mr Slane said yesterday that the police should have to obtain an interception warrant from a judge too.
Hacking into a computer and intercepting electronic communications was far more intrusive than police saying, "We have got some evidence this guy's got stolen property."
The report also calls for the GCSB to be omitted from the exemption clauses until it becomes a statutory body like the Prime Minister Helen Clark has said the bureau would be written into law this year.
Mr Slane said it should not be given more rights until the public was aware of its accountability and powers.
"Unlike the SIS, any interceptions which may be carried out are not subject to a statutory warrant process.
"This will not be put right until the GCSB's establishment is set out in legislation."

#    #    The Court of Appeals had earlier defined New York's constitutional
#    right to a "sound basic education" as learning the competence
#    to vote and serve on a jury.
#    #    The plaintiffs, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, argued that new
#    Regents standards do include the cognitive skills to analyze #    complex ballot propositions and weigh statistical and other #    technical evidence in jury trials.
#    #    But, the Campaign showed, the state does not appropriate enough

#    #    The state's witnesses, paradoxically, denied that the state's

Sure it is. The BATF was the lead agency:
    o The F.B.I., through the Department of Justice, requested that Texas
      Governor Ann Richards allow the use of helicopters from the Texas
      National Guard at Waco. Texas law forbids the use of the National
      Guard in police action against a citizen of the state, except when
      drugs are involved in a criminal action.
      But the BATF fabricated a drug charge ("ugh, they're operating a
      methamphetamine lab or something huh-huh-huh") to gain the use of the
      helicopters. Later, Governor Richards stated publicly that she had
      been lied to by the Department of Justice.
    Senator:   Did the FBI consider delivering Avalon fire-retardant gas?
    Reno/FBI:  No, how could we deliver it without getting shot?
It's called running another tube out the tank turret, just as was done
for delivering the highly flammable chemical-weapons grade tear gas in
the first place. Use another tank if necessary.
It was that simple.
   "We did not know the complex was on fire at first, but we started
    smelling smoke. We didn't know what to do.
    We were afraid that if we came out of the building, we would be shot.
    All of a sudden, the smoke came. I couldn't see my husband any more."

#    #    Brit accuses U.S. of snooping
#    #    Europe admits it too taps corporate nets
#    #    BY DAN VERTON (January 29, 2001) The European Parliament received #    a detailed report last week that contains evidence of a 10-year #    effort by the U.S. government to use its intelligence technology #    to help U.S. companies win commercial contracts. The report was #    by a British journalist hired by the European Parliament to #    investigate a global electronic eavesdropping network.
#    #    The so-called Echelon network is run by an alliance among the #    U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The report #    came as a panel of experts testified in Europe last week that #    the U.S. isn't the only country plucking sensitive corporate #    and economic data from the Internet and airwaves.
#    #    "I referred many times [in the report] to the fact that European #    countries ran satellite [signal intelligence] systems to collect #    intelligence," Duncan Campbell, the author of the report, told #    Computerworld.
#    #    France and Germany are also known to employ modern technologies #    designed to collect economic intelligence that would help firms #    in those countries. Europeans are "open-minded and readily accept #    that our companies and governments - like [the U.S.]" spy, bribe #    and cheat on occasions, Campbell said. "The European inquiry #    is going ahead on that basis."
#    #    In his study, Campbell accused Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon #    Co. of receiving information from Echelon that allowed it to #    outbid two French firms in 1994 for a $1.4 billion contract with #    the Brazilian government for a system to monitor any environmental #    changes in the rain forests there. A Raytheon official called #    the charges groundless.
#    #    "Raytheon won the [contract] because it had the best technical #    solution and the lowest price and best financial proposal," a #    company spokesman said.
#    #    Neil MacCormick, a vice chairman of the European Parliament's #    special commission on Echelon, called Campbell's testimony sober #    and balanced. The use of Echelon, particularly its Advocacy #    Center, which helps U.S. businesses overcome unfair trading #    practices, is well documented, said MacCormick.
#    #    "It therefore follows that some of the output of Echelon is used #    in contexts of economic intelligence affecting the interests #    of non-U.S. businesses," he said.
#    #    "Many European nations should look into the mirror before #    complaining about economic espionage by other nations," said #    Cees Wiebes, a professor at the University of Amsterdam who #    testified last week before the parliament of the Netherlands.
#    #    According to Wiebes, many Dutch multinationals - including Philips #    Electronics NV and Royal Dutch/Shell Group - have received #    intelligence gathered by the Dutch equivalent of the U.S. National #    Security Agency (NSA) to support construction projects at airports #    and seaports.
#    #    But U.S. intelligence officials insisted that Echelon isn't used #    to covertly assist U.S. companies in their efforts to win #    contracts around the world. They said Echelon is used to uncover #    international fraud schemes, criminal activity and terrorist #    groups.
#    #    A spokesman for the NSA, which manages the Echelon network, said #    the agency operates in strict accordance with U.S. laws that #    prohibit the agency from providing "intelligence information #    to private firms for their economic advantage."
#    #    A former CIA official familiar with NSA operations who spoke #    on the condition of anonymity said he finds the claims of #    assistance to U.S. firms by the NSA hard to believe - except #    in cases involving specific military technologies. Campbell and #    the European Union are "overplaying the economic espionage aspect #    of Echelon," he said.
#    #    Executives in the U.S. also discounted claims made during a #    European Parliament hearing last November that U.S.-produced #    software such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system #    contains back doors that support Echelon activities.
#    #    Steve Lipner, manager of Microsoft's Security Response Center, #    said the best example of Microsoft's position on Echelon and #    of not allowing back doors to be implanted in its software is #    evident in its opposition to legislation that would require #    companies to share encryption keys with federal law enforcement.

#    #    Would-be shoplifters foiled
#    #    Sporting aluminum underwear illegal under new law
#    By Bill McKeown/The Gazette
#    #    If you're thinking about going to the mall in that snappy #    aluminum-lined underwear in the back of your dresser drawer, #    think again.
#    #    Beginning Sunday, it will be illegal in Colorado to wear aluminum #    underwear.
#    #    OK, there's a caveat. You can wear aluminum briefs and lingerie #    as long as it's for personal amusement - but not if it is to #    help steal by foiling stores' anti-shoplifting devices.
#    #    The new law, surely the oddest of the dozens coming out of this #    season's legislative session, is no laughing matter ... really.
#    #    "This is serious business," said Sen. Stephanie Takis, D-Aurora, #    one of the bill's sponsors. "We have laws against using crowbars #    as theft devices, but if you were lining your underwear with #    aluminum foil, that was not a crime."
#    #    And by golly, said Takis, it should be. She cited several #    Denver-area malls that have caught shoplifters with aluminum-lined #    shopping bags and even the so-called "iron pants" and could do #    nothing to stop it.
#    #    Steve Miller, an attorney with the Legislative Council, helped #    draft the bill: "I don't know if it was the highlight of my #    career, but I got the assignment."
#    #    Miller said the bill went through several evolutions - "or #    devolutions depending on your viewpoint" - before it received #    Gov. Bill Owens' approval.
#    #    Essentially, it makes it a misdemeanor to make, wear or know #    others are wearing aluminum underwear if they intend to use it #    to fool stores' theft-protection devices. Those devices #    electronically sense when merchandise leaving the store hasn't #    been handled by a cashier, and foil can interfere with that #    detection.
#    #    Miller said the new law also gives store employees civil and #    criminal immunity if they stop shoppers who crackle when they #    walk.

#    "In a packet world, somebody has to open the packet to look for
#    the information the FBI is seeking. Is the FBI going to do it?
#    We're not going to do it unless we are paid to do it.
#    #    Unresolved Issues Dog Fed's Data-Tap Efforts
#    By Doug Brown, Interactive Week
#    June 13, 2001 8:33 AM PT
#    #    #    Rapid changes in communications technology threaten to make "a big mess"
#    out of the federal government's ambitious plans to weave wiretapping into
#    the fabric of the digital age, while a 1994 law grows increasingly
#    outdated.
#    #    While parts of the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
#    (CALEA) have already been implemented by phone and other communications
#    carriers, important areas of the law are being disputed in courtrooms and
#    mulled over by bureaucrats in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
#    Federal Communications Commission.
#    #    One unresolved issue is how to handle packet data, a technology that was
#    in its infancy when the law was written, but has since emerged as the
#    leading method for transmitting voice and data in the Internet age.
#    #    Communications companies carrying packet data have until Sept. 30 to
#    demonstrate that their systems will permit law enforcement officials to
#    conduct wiretaps. The industry has filed requests with the FCC to extend
#    the deadline. The FBI argues that extensions should not be granted.
#    Industry representatives say they need to figure out a way to separate
#    the packets' header data from content before they can implement any
#    standards, and the technological solution to the problem could take years
#    to figure out. It's up to the FCC to decide how to proceed.
#    #    "We believe the packet issue is going to be around for a long time," said
#    Rodney Small, an economist in the FCC's office of engineering and
#    technology who handles CALEA. Industry has "decided it's too expensive to
#    do this, and they aren't sure what the privacy implications are," Small
#    said. "They are getting cold feet, legally and financially. Meanwhile,
#    these new technologies keep developing. . . . On the packet data 'issue',
#    there could be more petitions and it could be a big mess."
#    #    An industry official agreed. "You will see more lawsuits or court
#    challenges. You'll certainly see carriers filing extensions on packet
#    data deadlines," said Grant Seiffert, vice president of external affairs
#    and global policy at the Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade
#    group representing many telecommunications carriers implicated in the
#    CALEA regulations. "In a packet world, somebody has to open the packet to
#    look for the information the FBI is seeking. Is the FBI going to do it?
#    We're not going to do it unless we are paid to do it. Who is going to be
#    looking over everyone's shoulders when we open up this information?"
#    #    As the packet data issue looms, industry and civil liberties advocates
#    await signals from the Bush administration about how new regulators -
#    particularly FCC commissioners and the new FBI director - plan to
#    approach government surveillance issues. The agencies' decisions could
#    affect the depth of the debates.
#    #    "Congress may be re-engaged," Seiffert said. "It's sort of a wait-and-see
#    game right now."
#    #    "The FBI's credibility is at an all-time low here," said Barry
#    Steinhardt, associate director at the American Civil Liberties Union.
#    "Attorney General 'John' Ashcroft in the Senate expressed skepticism
#    about a number of government surveillance programs."
#    #    An FBI spokesman defended work to date, saying: "There has been
#    significant progress made with the implementation of CALEA," and citing
#    technical solutions available for wireline and wireless segments of the
#    telecom industry.
#    #    Some CALEA experts question some of what the FBI has managed to implement
#    already, charging that the agency installed sophisticated data collection
#    systems in communications networks that require expensive equipment to
#    decipher.
#    #    "It's close to a scandal," said Stewart Baker, an attorney and former
#    general counsel at the National Security Agency who has been involved
#    with legal challenges to CALEA. "After industry has spent all of this
#    money, it turns out it's generating all of this data that has to be
#    translated by special-purpose machines that have to be bought by local
#    law enforcement. This may have the effect of pricing wiretaps out of the
#    market for a lot of smaller jurisdictions."
#    #    Baker also said that while CALEA is supposed to apply only to voice
#    communications, the FBI has been "pretty aggressive" when it delves into
#    the packet data realm, "trying to persuade people who build data networks
#    that sooner or later they will have to provide wiretap capability."
#    #    "A year ago, when times were good, everybody leaned towards the view that
#    it was better to not pick a fight with the FBI," Baker said. "Now it's
#    less clear that people have the funds to spend on development or to
#    purchase this stuff, so there could be a serious conflict over this and
#    there is certainly a difficult question for people who are building
#    Internet Protocol systems."

#    #    U.S. Charges Internet Operation Was a Huge Scam
#    #    By KURT EICHENWALD
#    #    OKLAHOMA CITY - By last September, life was getting rough for #    Donald A. English.
#    #    An unemployed single father, Mr. English was almost out of cash. #    His family was threatened with eviction. Collection agencies #    were at the door. His credit cards were mostly tapped out.
#    #    With the walls closing in, Mr. English, 53, decided to grab for #    a distinctly modern solution to his crumbling finances: He started #    his own dot-com.
#    #    But this was no ordinary Internet company. Instead, government #    investigators said, it was the centerpiece of a huge scam. With #    it, they said, this down-and-outer from Midwest City, Okla., #    established one of history's fastest frauds, conning tens of #    thousands of small investors out of as much as $50 million in #    a matter of weeks, until the scheme collapsed early this year #    in scandal.
#    #    #    Investigators have stumbled across imaginary banks hawking #    nonexistent "digital" certificates of deposit, illusory #    trillion-dollar government obligations and bogus business deals #    to "lease" millions of dollars in cash.
#    #    #    In the case of EE-Biz, court records show, investors who signed #    up opened an account with a legitimate company that functioned #    like a bank, using an Internet currency known as e-gold. Then, #    they transferred dollars in e-gold - a transaction known as a #    spend, involving as little as $20 or as much as several thousand #    - to an e-gold account, controlled by someone else. The early #    investors received double their money back, with no explanation #    of how it was done. As word spread of the payouts, investors #    flocked to the site to participate.
#    #    Mr. English himself had been a victim of a number of similar #    schemes and decided to open up his own, according to transcripts #    of chat room conversations. Those transcripts indicate that Mr. #    English himself may not have completely understood the bogus #    nature of the plan.

  19  Bobby and Cindy were 14. While both had masturbated, neither was
  20  really sure what sex was all about. That's why they were hiding in the
  21  closet in Marcia's room. They had watched everything Greg and Marcia
  22  had done, and were more than ready to give it a try.  Bobby's almost
  23  hairless cock had gotten hard before Greg had even mounted Marcia, and
  24  it was still hard. Cindy's virgin pussy was so wet her panties were
  25  soaked. As soon as Marcia and Greg were gone, they rushed out of the
  26  closet and fell onto the bed. They had stripped while they watched,
  27  but were too afraid of making noise to do anything.
  28    29  Bobby pulled Cindy close, kissed her eyes and mouth the way he'd seen
  30  Greg kiss Marcia. He moved down to Cindy's tiny, barely bulging
  31  titties and began to lick and suck the nipples. They hardened even

  38    39  They skipped the rest of the foreplay they had seen. Both were eager

  41  could be painful. Cindy liked Bobby, trusted him, wanted him to be her
  42  first. She lay on her back, her face framed by blond curls, her
  43  lightly haired snatch a slightly darker blonde. She spread her legs
  44  wide, fingered herself for a moment, letting Bobby look at her
  45  pussy. Bobby stretched out above her, his knees between her legs, his
  46  arms supporting his weight, his young, hard cock touching her
  47  belly. Cindy took hold of his tool, guided it to her cunt, helped him
  48  enter her. He entered slowly, stopping when Cindy flinched. He started
  49  to backup, not wanting to hurt her. She grabbed his ass with both
  50  hands, pulled him hard towards herself, felt a tearing pain in her
  51  cunt. She buried her face in his shoulder, stifling a scream.  She
  52  told him not to move, told him that she had been told the pain would
  53  go away in a few minutes.

#    Charles Schwab Unit $10 Million
#    #    By PAUL BECKETT
#    Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    Federal and state bank regulators fined Charles Schwab Corp.'s #    U.S. Trust unit $10 million -- one of the largest fines levied #    against a U.S. bank -- as part of a settlement of allegations #    that its internal controls and record-keeping were inadequate.
#    #    The hefty fine, $5 million of which was levied by the Federal #    Reserve, $5 million by the New York State Banking Department, #    was accompanied by a cease-and-desist order, the second-highest #    level of bank enforcement action short of a license revocation.
#    #    People familiar with the matter say that some of the alleged #    offenses that caused the severe regulatory action concerned the #    bank's failure to report to the federal government currency #    transactions over $10,000, as required by a federal law designed #    to aid in combating money-laundering.
#    #    The bank also failed to report transactions that appeared designed #    to skirt those thresholds, for instance, when a customer either #    deposited or withdrew an amount just shy of $10,000, these people #    said. One person familiar with the matter said there were such #    transactions for $9,999. Another scenario involved customers #    making a series of withdrawals close together that totaled more #    than $10,000 but were not in keeping with the client's normal #    pattern of activity, people familiar with the matter say.

:       o A former FBI agent also agrees with his alibi: that he was

:       o And the jury never knew the eyewitness, who has since died,
:         had misidentified people in other cases.
:   He has been turned down for parole 16 times, and had been in prison
:   longer than most murderers.
:   6/10/97 MSNBC: Mr. Pratt has been freed over the U.S. Attorney's
:   objections. His first minutes of freedom were spent with his
:   94-year-old mother.
:   Court TV:
:        Judge Dickey overturned the conviction last month, ruling that
:   prosecutors failed to tell the defense that the key witness against
:   Pratt was an infiltrator and paid informant for the FBI and police.
:   *** This primary "witness" had claimed Pratt confessed!!! ***
:        "It's madness in there," Pratt said after walking out of jail

to release these tools anonymously. Document why it is

#    atives from British broadcasting, the music industry, publishers #    and others with an interest in protecting copyrighted material. #    The Report of the Intellectual Property Group of the Creative #    Industries Task Force
#    [  ]
#    recommends, among other things, that copyright be brought into
#    the classroom -- not as a separate course, necessarily, but
#    integrated into the regular curriculum.
#    #    "Copyright is relevant to music, art, information, technology, #    and English; and patents and design rights are relevant to science #    and design technology," reads the report. It goes on to recommend #    specific ways teachers might make copyright issues a little more #    real to their 12- to 18-year-olds: "School children should #    recognize their own creativity by including the copyright symbol #    on their course work."
#    #    #    Interest in bringing copyright into the classroom is growing #    among government officials in Britain as well. Chris Smith, #    secretary of state for culture, media and sport, recently said: #    "Intellectual property rights are at the heart of the new #    knowledge economy and are of vital importance to the creative #    industries. Greater recognition by the public of the role and #    importance of intellectual property rights must be encouraged."
#    #    Intellectual property is already a part of the British school #    system, but mostly in the higher grades. An "Intellectual Property #    Pack Set," a CD-ROM designed to "Give Students Competitive Edge," #    [  ]
#    is produced by the Patent Office in conjunction with Bournemouth #    University and distributed to students across the country. #    Meanwhile, officials at the Patent Office, which is responsible #    for copyright, patents and trade marks in the U.K., are holding #    regular meetings with officials at the Department for Education #    and Skills to bring intellectual property issues into the #    curriculum at an early age.
#    #    So where does copyright fit in to the classroom fare of a British #    12-year-old? Teaching intellectual property is one of many #    competing areas trying to be part of the "citizenship" subject, #    which will become compulsory in U.K. secondary schools beginning #    in September 2002. This new citizenship program aims to teach #    pupils social and moral responsibility, political literacy, sex #    education and the importance of marriage and family life.
#    #    According to the Patent Office's director of copyright, Anthony #    Murphy, a major proponent of the new program, understanding #    intellectual property carries important social value: "By bringing #    awareness of the importance of copyright into our schools, #    tomorrow's consumers can take their place in a community which #    understands, values and respects intellectual property."
#    #    But even the program's proponents agree that teenagers may not #    be receptive to a program that teaches them that trading MP3s #    is morally wrong. Anthony Murphy acknowledges that: "The idea #    that counterfeiting and piracy are victimless crimes is an all #    too common perception."
#    #    Jessica Litman, professor of law at Wayne State University and #    author of "Digital Copyright," agrees. "Young people, and other #    people, believe in a version of the copyright law that is #    different from the one now on the books. Many of them believe, #    for example, that if you buy a CD, you buy the right to share #    it. "
#    #    Some opponents also argue that it may be inappropriate to be #    bringing intellectual property (I.P.) education into the classroom #    when laws surrounding it are so hotly contested. Litman says #    that educating children on the difference between "good" and #    "bad" behavior is tough in a field that's in flux: "Any effort #    to include I.P. in a moral education curriculum has to grapple #    with the fact that the moral choices made in extant versions #    of I.P. law are highly contested."
#    #    Finally, if controversy over intellectual property can be managed #    into a school curriculum, will students learn the lesson? As #    with the American DARE program, will educators find that telling #    students what decision to make might actually backfire?
#    [  ]
#    #    According to James Davison Hunter, professor of sociology and #    religious studies at the University of Virginia and author of #    "The Death of Character," "Moral education programs have little #    or no positive effect upon moral behavior, achievement or anything #    else."
#    #    The desire to preach citizenship reflects a deep-rooted anxiety #    about whether young people can grow into law-abiding citizens. #    Copyright educators can only hope that students aren't immune #    to their teachings.

The congressional ire was triggered by the CIA's refusal to participate in

INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT QUESTIONED
"Is the CIA's refusal to cooperate with Congressional inquiries a threat to
effective oversight of the operations of the Federal Government?"
That rather leading question was the topic of an unusual hearing before two
subcommittees of the House Government Reform Committee yesterday.
The hearing was unusual because the established structures of intelligence
oversight are rarely criticized within Congress itself, and Republican
committee chairmen rarely speak of the CIA with anger and indignation.  But
yesterday they did.
"The CIA is assaulting Congress's constitutional responsibility to oversee
executive branch activities," said subcommittee chairman Rep. Stephen Horn
(R-Calif.)  "The CIA believes it is above that basic principle in our
Constitution.  We do not agree."
"Tell me why I shouldn't be outraged," said Rep. Christopher Shays
(R-Conn.), also a subcommittee chair.  "When faced with persistent
institutionalized [CIA] resistance to legitimate inquiries, we're compelled
to reassert our authority,"
The congressional ire was triggered by the CIA's refusal to participate in
a committee hearing on computer security at the Agency.
"Neither I nor any CIA representative will testify," wrote DCI George J.
Tenet bluntly on July 17.  He noted that House Intelligence Committee
chairman Porter Goss "urged me not to testify."  See Tenet's letter here:
        This prompted a fascinating discussion at yesterday's hearing of the
respective oversight roles of the House Intelligence Committee and the
House Government Reform Committee;  the adequacy of the House Intelligence
Committee's performance;  the definition of intelligence "sources and
methods" (which, by House rule, are the exclusive purview of the
Intelligence Committee);  the need to limit oversight of sensitive
intelligence matters;  the role of the General Accounting Office in
intelligence oversight; and other fundamental issues.
The questions were generally better than the answers.  Some of the
testimony concerning national security classification was incorrect or
misleading.  But the official anger at the CIA was palpable, and may yet
have policy consequences for the Agency.
The witness statements from the hearing are posted here:
        "It is important to curtail growing GAO initiatives to investigate
intelligence activities," according to a 1994 CIA memorandum on CIA policy
toward the General Accounting Office that was released yesterday.  The
memo, authored by Stanley M. Moskowitz (who went on to fame if not fortune
as CIA station chief in Tel Aviv), is posted here:

#    #    Security Cameras In Banks,
#    Private Business Ruled
#    Illegal In Canada
#    By Jen Ross
#    The Ottawa Citizen
#    7-18-1
#    #    #    #    #    Big Brother may want to watch you, but you are legally entitled #    to flick the off switch.
#    #    That is the implication of the Personal Information Protection #    and Electronic Documents Act (PIPED), which makes it illegal #    for any private company to collect personal information on an #    individual without their expressed consent or a warrant.
#    #    "I could walk into a bank and ask them to turn off the camera #    because it violates my privacy rights," said Peter Mantas, a #    technology lawyer in Ottawa for law firm Heenan and Blaikie.
#    #    "That would certainly put them in a huff ... (but) it would be #    against the law for the bank manager to decline."
#    #    People can also request that a security camera in a convenience #    store be turned off while they are in the premises.
#    #    Last month, in the first decision under the act, which came into #    effect Jan. 1, federal Privacy Commissioner George Radwanski #    told a Yellowknife security company the installation of street #    surveillance cameras is unlawful.
#    #    "People have the right to go about their business without feeling #    that their actions are being systematically observed and #    monitored," said Mr. Radwanski.
#    #    The privacy commissioner has since launched an investigation #    into the issue of video surveillance monitoring and will not #    comment on particular cases until that investigation is completed.
#    #    Mr. Mantas says the act has broader implications for workplace #    surveillance of employees and for the use of video for consumer #    profiling than have yet to be realized. Moreover, although the #    act would allow a security video to be handed over to police #    if it showed evidence of criminal activity, in theory, if you #    can shut off the bank camera and then commit a robbery, there #    would be no proof to hand over.
#    #    "It means a lot because it's going to compromise investigations," #    said Sgt. Loretta Ronchin, of the Greater Sudbury Police Service. #    "I'm going to be really interested to see what happens."
#    #    Sudbury became the first Canadian city to use closed-circuit #    television monitoring of public streets in 1996. Sgt. Ronchin #    says in the five years since their "lion's eye in the sky" was #    introduced, there has been a 38-per-cent reduction in robberies #    and assaults. They have five cameras that feed into the Sudbury #    police station.
#    #    London, Ont., Winnipeg and Toronto also opted for such systems #    and various cities, including Calgary and Kelowna, are currently #    looking to install cameras in public areas.
#    #    But Mr. Mantas suspects the PIPED Act may not be applied to street #    monitoring done directly by police because the act covers private #    organizations. Government bodies are covered by their own laws, #    which Mr. Mantas characterized as much more relaxed.
#    #    "I think it's quite troubling," said Mr. Mantas, of the #    public-private divide. "Are we to see a situation where people's #    privacy is being enhanced
#    #    in the private sector, but it is being less protected at the #    level of the state?"
#    #    Mr. Radwanski ruled that both live and recorded video pictures #    qualify as "personal information" under the act. However, he #    did acknowledge there may be instances where it is appropriate #    for public places to be monitored for public safety reasons, #    but that such surveillance must be limited to instances where #    there is a demonstrated need.
#    #    "I would think that the invasion of privacy is dwarfed by the #    crime prevention that video provides," said Steve Kelly, spokesman #    for the Canadian Alarm and Security Association. "If you don't #    have anything to hide, why should you be upset with someone taking #    your picture?"

#    #    WASHINGTON -- A researcher in the Federal Bureau of Investiga
#    tion's cyber-protection unit unleashed a fast-spreading Internet #    virus that e-mailed private FBI documents to outsiders -- all #    on the eve of a Senate hearing into troubles at the unit.
#    #    Although the Sircam virus didn't spread to other computers at #    the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, it did send #    at least eight documents to a number of outsiders. One, about #    the investigation into an unrelated virus, was marked "official #    use only." The Sircam virus has infected thousands of computers #    since its discovery last week.
#    #    FBI spokeswoman Deb Weierman said that no sensitive or classified #    information about continuing investigations was disclosed Tuesday. #    The "official use" designation protects documents from disclosure #    under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.
#    #    It isn't uncommon for virus researchers to accidentally infect #    their own computers, but the mistake was particularly embarrassing #    because it occurred ahead of a Senate Judiciary panel's oversight #    hearing about the FBI cyber unit's effectiveness. Lawmakers were #    expected to focus on other agencies' failure to cooperate fully #    with the FBI center, and on a perceived lack of trust between #    the FBI and private-sector groups.
#    #    The unit generally gets high remarks for its criminal #    investigations, and even critics say the unit is more effective #    than it was a year ago. "The effort here is not to embarrass #    anybody but to stress that a lot of work has to be done," said #    Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona.
#    #    Meanwhile, the White House has begun organizing a new #    early-warning network for Internet threats. But unlike the current #    system, it will be coordinated by the Pentagon, not the FBI. #    The mechanism for warning all U.S. military and civilian agencies #    -- and ultimately corporations -- will be dubbed the Cyber-Warning #    and Information Network, or "c-win." Organizers envision dozens #    of computer centers that could sound an alert when a threat is #    identified.
#    #    The network is expected to begin operating in October. The FBI #    unit, which currently relays these warnings, came under sharp #    criticism from congressional auditors for issuing tardy alerts. #    Ms. Weierman, the FBI spokeswoman, called the new network a #    "useful mechanism" to offer the government a "technical capability #    that doesn't currently exist."

#    #    Tuesday, at least three people said they received some of the #    FBI documents, including a 23-year-old Internet-security expert #    in Belgium, Niels Heinen. He operates a Web site that reports #    on Internet break-ins and speculated that the analyst, Vince #    Rowe, visited the site on the infected computer.

#    That E-Mails Private Agency Documents
#    #    By TED BRIDIS
#    Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    WASHINGTON -- A researcher in the Federal Bureau of Investiga
#    tion's cyber-protection unit unleashed a fast-spreading Internet #    virus that e-mailed private FBI documents to outsiders -- all #    on the eve of a Senate hearing into troubles at the unit.
#    #    Although the Sircam virus didn't spread to other computers at #    the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, it did send #    at least eight documents to a number of outsiders. One, about #    the investigation into an unrelated virus, was marked "official #    use only." The Sircam virus has infected thousands of computers #    since its discovery last week.
#    #    FBI spokeswoman Deb Weierman said that no sensitive or classified #    information about continuing investigations was disclosed Tuesday. #    The "official use" designation protects documents from disclosure #    under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.
#    #    It isn't uncommon for virus researchers to accidentally infect #    their own computers, but the mistake was particularly embarrassing #    because it occurred ahead of a Senate Judiciary panel's oversight #    hearing about the FBI cyber unit's effectiveness. Lawmakers were #    expected to focus on other agencies' failure to cooperate fully #    with the FBI center, and on a perceived lack of trust between #    the FBI and private-sector groups.
#    #    The unit generally gets high remarks for its criminal #    investigations, and even critics say the unit is more effective #    than it was a year ago. "The effort here is not to embarrass #    anybody but to stress that a lot of work has to be done," said #    Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona.
#    #    Meanwhile, the White House has begun organizing a new #    early-warning network for Internet threats. But unlike the current #    system, it will be coordinated by the Pentagon, not the FBI. #    The mechanism for warning all U.S. military and civilian agencies #    -- and ultimately corporations -- will be dubbed the Cyber-Warning #    and Information Network, or "c-win." Organizers envision dozens #    of computer centers that could sound an alert when a threat is #    identified.

#    #    Although the Sircam virus didn't spread to other computers at #    the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, it did send #    at least eight documents to a number of outsiders. One, about #    the investigation into an unrelated virus, was marked "official #    use only." The Sircam virus has infected thousands of computers #    since its discovery last week.
#    #    FBI spokeswoman Deb Weierman said that no sensitive or classified #    information about continuing investigations was disclosed Tuesday. #    The "official use" designation protects documents from disclosure #    under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.
#    #    It isn't uncommon for virus researchers to accidentally infect #    their own computers, but the mistake was particularly embarrassing #    because it occurred ahead of a Senate Judiciary panel's oversight #    hearing about the FBI cyber unit's effectiveness. Lawmakers were #    expected to focus on other agencies' failure to cooperate fully #    with the FBI center, and on a perceived lack of trust between #    the FBI and private-sector groups.
#    #    The unit generally gets high remarks for its criminal #    investigations, and even critics say the unit is more effective #    than it was a year ago. "The effort here is not to embarrass #    anybody but to stress that a lot of work has to be done," said #    Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona.
#    #    Meanwhile, the White House has begun organizing a new #    early-warning network for Internet threats. But unlike the current #    system, it will be coordinated by the Pentagon, not the FBI. #    The mechanism for warning all U.S. military and civilian agencies #    -- and ultimately corporations -- will be dubbed the Cyber-Warning #    and Information Network, or "c-win." Organizers envision dozens #    of computer centers that could sound an alert when a threat is #    identified.
#    #    The network is expected to begin operating in October. The FBI #    unit, which currently relays these warnings, came under sharp #    criticism from congressional auditors for issuing tardy alerts. #    Ms. Weierman, the FBI spokeswoman, called the new network a #    "useful mechanism" to offer the government a "technical capability #    that doesn't currently exist." The FBI, she said, wasn't concerned #    it would lose its warning responsibilities.
#    #    Tuesday, at least three people said they received some of the #    FBI documents, including a 23-year-old Internet-security expert #    in Belgium, Niels Heinen. He operates a Web site that reports #    on Internet break-ins and speculated that the analyst, Vince #    Rowe, visited the site on the infected computer.

#    WASHINGTON -- The head of a new US cyber law-enforcement agency

#    "A good percentage of the incidents we see ... involve [the

Declan, I finally realized what you were talking
about when you wrote this: #    [Vatis'] reported comments are a little, well, unusual. This was apparently what you were referring to: Tim May receives NIPC internal notes:
#    Michael Vatis, deputy assistant director and chief of the Federal

#    exam, the ultimate challenge, the enemy which must be destroyed."
#    Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing these persons out of
#    the public debate. Notice the closing quotes on Vatis's testimony. I immediately read and attributed that last sentence to another voice. We are looking at an FBI agent's internal notes, recounting events. Who said this: #    Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing these persons out of
#    the public debate. General Ashcroft, of course. Here, I'll combine it with the smoking gun: #    Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing these crypto

#    assist in the take-down of a high-profile hacker terrorist at

OH OH OH I am soooo pissed off, I'm gonna flame
for the fire of it.  ---- One of the most stunningly vile attempts to attack an
individual occurred just a couple years ago, in 1995. The attack was itself a throwback to the old days of COINTELPRO, (Counter-
Intelligence Program), a massive unconstitutional FBI operation --- one of
it's most abusive ever --- to discredit the politically incorrect. *   Main Justice, by Jim McGee and Brian Duffy, 1996, ISBN 0-684-81135-9
*   And it was not just the FBI. The CIA, the Pentagon and the National
*   Security Agency [Military] had all turned their intelligence-gathering
*   capabilities on American citizens. And who was targeted? Qubilah Shabazz, second oldest daughter of Malcom X. *   Both Sides in Shabazz Case Say Tapes Prove Their Point
*   by Don Terry, The New York Times, April 1995
*   Ms. Shabazz was indicted on Jan 11 on nine counts of using the *   and travelling across state lines to hire a hit man to kill Mr. *   Eight of the counts involved taped telephone calls between Ms. Shabazz *   Mr. Fitzpatrick, a cocaine addict who faces a possible five-year prison
*   sentence in an unrelated drug case. [read: blackmailed]
*   Of the 40 recorded conversations, 38 were initiated by Mr. Fitzpatrick.
*   "Most of the conversations during these calls consisted primarily of
*   remarks by Mr. Fitzpatrick." said defense lawyer William M. Kunstler.
*   [Kunstler was a silvered haired angel even while still on Earth]
*   The Government had a statement initialed from Ms. Shabazz.
*       "I jokingly asked Fitzpatrick if he would kill Louis Farrakhan."
*   The statement was written by two FBI agents, who did not advise her of
*   her right to remain silent and have a lawyer present.
*   Federal officials in Washington and Minneapolis say Ms. Shabazz was
*   'obsessed' with killing Mr. Farrakhan, and they had enough on her to
*   put her away for 90 years.
*   Mr. Fitzpatrick prodded her: "I'm willing to do whatever you want me to
*   do, this feels righteous." Ms. Shabazz replied "I don't really know
*   what you're asking me." Mr. Fitzpatrick later told her "I'm just going
*   to proceed." Qubilah Shabazz was 4 when she saw her father die in a hail of bullets in
1965. She has been a trouble woman ever since. *   "...Shabazz...", The New York Times, June 8 1997 (front page)
*   In telephone conversations taped by Federal prosecutors, Ms. Shabazz
*   acknowledged she had psychological problems and had spent time at Bellevue. Her mother long asserted  Mr. Farrakhan played a role in the death of her
husband. Three members of Mr. Farrakhan's Nation of Islam were convicted. And just what was so extraordinarily vile about this case? Its purpose was to tear the black community apart. Mr. Farrakhan, no fool when it comes to manipulation, joined in her defense. And: Mr. Fitzpatrick had been a high school classmate of Qubilah Shabazz. In courting her lifetime of anger at Mr. Farrakhan, he also courted her. Love. "A vile and evil seducer," said William Kunstler to the court. He had proposed to her. *   "Always the Violence", The New York Times, by Bob Herbert, June 9 1997
*   Percy Sutton, a close friend of the Shabazz family for more then three
*   decades, said "It was so sad. This little kid [Qubilah's son Malcolm, *   he ended up feeling guilty because he tried to persuade his mother to
*   marry this guy [Fitzpatrick told the son about his marriage proposal].
*   The guy told him 'We'll have our own house.' And Malcolm got all excited
*   and he said, 'I'll have my own bedroom?' And the guy said 'Yes, you will.'" It is safe to say this directly contributed to the burning and subsequent
death of Betty Shabazz.  A distraught, torn, ten-year-old suffering the
effects of this persecution. He had been taken away from his mother because of Fitzpatrick. NBC Newschannel 4 NY, on the death of Betty Shabazz:    "Police say the boy was upset he couldn't live with his mother." Kunstler forced the Government to drop its case...
*   "...Shabazz...", The New York Times, June 8 1997
*   Prosecutors dropped the case when it became
*   clear she had NOT committed to the crime. ...and instead settle for her getting professional counseling. Mainly to recover from what Mr. Fitzpatrick and the FBI did to her. Mr. Fitzpatrick was paid $45,000 of our tax money for his services. Mr. Fitzpatrick is a cocaine addict. Remember, it's the 1990s now: same as it ever was.  ---- #    I believe Ruby Ridge was an example of a barricade situation
#    which didn' t need to happen. The "crime" of selling a long gun
#    with a barrel one quarter of an inch too short was both a "set
#    up" (to induce cooperation by Randy Weaver) and shouldn't have
#    been a crime in the first place. These are mistakes, not evidence
#    of a Bureau that has become incompetent or malevolent.) Not malevolent?  Not malevolent? Tim, they targetted him solely to help them
with one of their surveillance programs. Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge. Persisting, a BATF informant persuaded Weaver, a DECORATED GREEN BERET
VETERAN of Vietnam with NO CRIMINAL RECORD, to sell him two shotguns,
but insisted that Weaver saw the barrels off one-quarter inch short of
the legal limit. Monitoring him, they knew Mr. Weaver needed money for his family. Why did the government target Mr. Weaver? Blackmail. One of the FBI's favorite activities is spying on political organizations. They wanted to use him to infiltrate white supremacists groups for the
government. Or face prosecution. When Weaver refused, he was indicted on guns charges. He was sent two
conflicting court appearance dates. He became paranoid the Government
was out to get him, so he didn't show up. [He was eventually acquitted
of all charges except the original not showing up in court!] To justify a militaristic retaliation, BATF agents lied to the U.S.
attorney's office. BATF agents claimed that Weaver had a criminal record
and that he was a suspect in several bank robberies. Both charges were fabrications, even according to BATF Director John Magaw,

from U.S. taxpayers. Deval Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, and
Louis Freeh, Director of the FBI, took no serious action. Larry Potts was the senior official in charge of the operation. Not only
was he not prosecuted, Freeh promoted him to acting deputy FBI director. *   "Documents Were Destroyed as FBI Resisted Siege Investigation, Report *   By David Johnston, July 16, 1995

at Ruby Ridge wasn't enough to cause her to veto the promotion, her actions at Waco. After two months, controversy (as opposed to events) over Potts' role in
Ruby Ridge prompted Freeh to remove him from the position, to politically
cover his own tush. Potts and four other top FBI officials have been suspended while a federal
criminal probe investigates the destruction of documents related to the
incident. A total of twelve agents were disciplined. None have yet been prosecuted. The Federal government subsequently named after a U.S. Marshal who was
killed, but who also shot Randy Weaver's son dead in the back: a new
Marshals training center. The Federal government's behavior in the incident can only be described as

#    #    LOS ANGELES - Attorneys Johnnie Cochran and Cameron Steward Monday #    announced the filing of a wrongful death complaint against the #    city of Los Angeles and the LAPD arising out of the shooting #    death of an actor at a Halloween party last year.
#    #    The 39-year-old actor from Van Nuys was shot several times while #    attending a Halloween party at a mansion in Benedict Canyon. #    The police had been summoned by someone who complained of #    excessive noise.
#    #    "As the officers were walking along an exterior walkway, Officer #    Hopper looked through a glass door and observed three individuals #    inside a small room," according to a Los Angeles Police Department #    statement.
#    #    "When one of the individuals observed the officers, he suddenly #    produced what appeared to be a handgun and pointed it directly #    at Officer Hopper," the statement continued. "Officer Hopper, #    in fear for his life, fired several rounds from his service #    pistol, wounding the suspect."
#    #    The coroner's report, obtained by the Los Angeles Times, found #    Anthony Dwain Lee had been shot once in the back of the head #    and three times in the back.
#    #    The findings appeared to contradict the police department's quick #    and confident defense of officer Tarriel Hopper, who was #    dispatched to the late- night mansion party in Benedict Canyon #    based on neighbors' noise complaints.

What's the deal with the FCC fining (censoring) a Colorado radio
station for playing the _censored_ version of one of his songs?
#    #    SHADY MOVES LEAD TO FINE FOR RADIO STATION
#    #    A radio station in the US has been fined $7,000 for playing #    EMINEM's 'THE REAL SLIM SHADY', even though the tune had been #    edited for broadcast.
#    #    The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) slapped the fine #    on KKMG-FM of Colorado Springs because, it said, the station #    had be censured despite the edit, because of the tone of the #    tune.
#    #    "The edited version of the song contains unmistakable offensive #    sexual references. In this regard, portions of the lyrics contain #    sexual references in conjunction with sexual expletives that #    appear intended to pander and shock," they said in a statement.
#    #    Two months ago, the FCC issued new guidelines to be used when #    determining what is obscene and what is decent and made it clear #    that innuendo was a factor, even if specific expletives were #    missing.
#    #    The fine has been roundly condemned. Hilary Rosen, chief of the #    RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) told Variety #    magazine that: "It would be a disgrace if the FCC were to impose #    a violation on a radio station because they didn't like the #    'suggestive' nature of a song. That goes right to the heart of #    idea-based censorship."
#    #    A spokesperson for Citadel Communications, KKMG-FM's parent #    company, said the fine set a dangerous precedent.
#    #    "The danger involved is that folks at the station level can't #    take comfort in the fact that something labelled 'radio edit #    version' is in compliance with the FCC's rules," he said

#    by a bank or other "trusted" institution, the company says.
#    #    June 7, 2001
#    #    Global Name Registry Hopes To Score Big With '.Name'
#    #    By BUSTER KANTROW Dow Jones Newswires
#    #    STOCKHOLM -- What's in a .name?
#    #    For Britain's Global Name Registry Ltd., the hope is, a lot. #    The London-based start-up is the global administrator for ".name," #    one of the new top-level Internet domain names to be introduced #    this year.
#    #    As the gatekeeper for the entire domain, GNR will begin #    distributing ".name" addresses this autumn, collecting a $5.25 #    (6.16 euros) wholesale registration fee and a similar annual #    renewal fee for each one it hands out.
#    #    The company also plans to provide more than just a name. It hopes #    to transform the .name addresses into a multipurpose tool that #    can receive e-mail or serve as a virtual credit card.
#    #    It's a formula that could pay off in millions or even billions #    of dollars in annual revenue, if demand for ".name" Internet #    suffixes takes off.
#    #    "People have an emotional affinity for their names," said GNR's #    chief executive, Andrew Tsai, in a recent interview. "Clearly, #    Icann picked a space where they thought millions and millions #    of people wanted addresses."
#    #    New Competition Ahead
#    #    Originally a spinoff of Norway's Nameplanet.com, which operates #    a free Web-based, e-mail service, GNR beat dozens of other #    applicants to the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, #    or Icann, the U.S.-based agency that manages the Internet-address #    system. The would-be registries included such familiar names #    as Finland's Nokia Corp. and Lycos Inc.
#    #    The new top-level domains -- which include ".biz," ".info" and #    ".museum" -- are intended to create new competition in the #    domain-name space, which has been dominated by California-based #    VeriSign Inc., central administrator of the ubiquitous ".com" #    suffix.
#    #    VeriSign's control of the ".com" suffix was recently extended #    by Icann, despite criticism from the Internet community, where #    there has been some resentment of the company's monopoly position. #    VeriSign has agreed to relinquish control of the ".org" and ".net" #    suffixes.
#    #    Mr. Tsai, formerly president of Urbanfetch Ltd., said he thought #    the initial demand for the new domains would be strongest in #    North America. But he said registrars, who act as middlemen #    between the U.K. company and individual customers, are also #    reporting strong interest in the ".name" domain from China, Korea #    and other parts of Southeast Asia.
#    #    "The opportunities are mind-boggling, but this is a very, very #    challenging discipline, to set up a registry," he said. "We #    consider ourselves a technology infrastructure company, and we #    don't take for granted the challenges of implementing this #    business plan."
#    #    GNR's backers include Carlyle Europe Venture Partners LP, #    Northzone Ventures AS and Four Seasons Venture AS.
#    #    With the lucrative ".name" registry in hand, it is Nameplanet #    that is now the subsidiary of GNR. "The student has become the #    teacher," says Mr. Tsai.
#    #    GNR is billing ".name" as more than a Web address. Along with #    technology partners such as New York-based Speednames Inc. and #    International Business Machines Corp., the U.K. company hopes #    to transform .name addresses into a multipurpose "digital #    identity" that can also serve as an e-mail address, cellphone #    number and even an electronic credit card.
#    #    Instead of typing in a credit card number, customers could simply #    provide their ".name" address, and merchants would then be able #    to retrieve the financial information from a secure server hosted #    by a bank or other "trusted" institution, the company says.
#    #    Such value-added services are expected to provide an additional #    revenue stream for GNR, as well as for the registrars.
#    #    "There is no other domain out there currently that has any #    functionality," says Mr. Tsai.
#    #    GNR moved a step closer to launching the new addresses over the #    weekend here, as Icann set a deadline of June 30 for giving final, #    formal approval to the new domain.
#    #    Manifest Destiny
#    #    Once the approval is secured, GNR will begin handing out names #    to around 80 registrars around the world, who will sell them #    to individuals, Mr. Tsai said.
#    #    The addresses will be registered with two dots (i.e., #    joseph.smith.name) in order to maximize the potential #    combinations, and will be introduced in phases.
#    #    The new addresses are reserved for individuals. But companies #    and others will first have an opportunity to ask that addresses #    related to their trademarks be removed from the database.
#    #    GNR will then launch a series of two-week "land rushes" when #    registrars may submit lists of requested addresses. If two #    individuals request the same address, one of the two will be #    randomly chosen, Mr. Tsai said.
#    #    The first names should be available to individuals by early #    autumn, the company said.
#    #    GNR says there will be five to 10 land rushes, then names will #    be handed out as requested. Registrars are expected to sell the #    addresses for $20 to $35 annually -- roughly what a ".com" address #    costs now, Mr. Tsai said.

@_subject: ORBS sucked into a black hole! 
#    #    A spam cop goes AWOL
#    #    The ORBS blacklist, a controversial tool for stopping unsolicited #    e-mail, is suddenly inaccessible.
#    #    - - - - - - - - - - - -
#    #    By Damien Cave
#    #    June 8, 2001 | Spam fighters all over the world have lost a #    controversial weapon in the battle against unsolicited e-mail. #    Since June 1, the Web site for ORBS -- the Open Relay Behavior #    Modification System -- has been gutted. Visitors to the site #    now find nothing more than a gray blank page and a simple message: #    "Due to circumstances beyond our control, the ORBS website is #    no longer available."
#    #    ORBS's main service was a blacklist of Internet mail servers #    -- computers capable of routing mail across the Net -- that the #    ORBS administrator, Alan Brown, had identified as potentially #    capable of forwarding spam. Now that blacklist is no longer #    available to network administrators, and they want to know why. #    One popular theory mooted on the Net is that Brown closed down #    the site rather than comply with a New Zealand court order #    demanding that he remove two specific ISPs from the blacklist. #    But Brown, who lives in New Zealand, is keeping silent. "I am #    unable to answer any of your questions," he writes in an e-mail. #    "Sorry."
#    #    Even without an explanation, the demise of ORBS is significant, #    stirring up, once again, an ongoing worldwide debate over how #    best to administer the Internet and mediate the Net's intersection #    of humanity and technology. Questions about ORBS's behavior always #    centered on the problem of how to handle e-mail abuse. But more #    generally, ORBS symbolized the ongoing struggle between the Net's #    tendency to encourage individual freedom and the necessity of #    combating anarchy.
#    #    Ever since the Net moved beyond its roots as a small, open, #    academic community, users have attempted to balance opposing #    forces. Most favor the right to speak out, along with the right #    to privacy; they rail against censorship, but at the same time #    desperately seek the ability to censor unsolicited e-mail by #    limiting spammers' access to their networks.
#    #    ORBS supporters say the blacklist was a fully justified form #    of preventive medicine. Brown saw his mission as identifying #    every mail server on the Net that allowed "open relays" -- in #    essence, that permitted the forwarding of mail from one point #    on the Net to another without any restriction. Spammers love #    open relays; they employ them to hide their identities and funnel #    out massive amounts of e-mail for free. But at the same time #    the open relays bog down the system for other customers.
#    #    Brown used simple software agents and diagnostic probes to comb #    the Internet, looking for mail servers configured for open #    relaying. Whenever he found one, Brown would post the Internet #    protocol (IP) address on his list -- even if the address had #    never been used by a spammer. ISPs, systems administrators and #    everyday citizens who configured their computers to block #    addresses listed on ORBS could then close off a spammer's favorite #    distribution tool even before the spammer knew it existed.
#    #    More controversial, Brown also placed on his list servers that #    blocked his probes, whether or not he could ascertain if they #    had open relays. ORBS supporters say such a policy was the only #    way to keep a flood of open-relay-capable servers from pumping #    spam across the Net. The end, they argue, justified the means.
#    #    The immediate impact of the ORBS shutdown could mean more spam, #    says Michael LeFevre, a London technology company executive. #    "I've received four spams since ORBS went down last week," he #    says. "I only received two or three previous to that this year."
#    #    But not everyone is sorry to see the site go. ORBS has plenty #    of critics. ORBS wasn't just a useful technology, they say; it #    was also a tool used by a specific person, Alan Brown, an #    overzealous spam fighter who went too far. ORBS's own ISP pulled #    the plug on Brown in 1998 after receiving complaints about the #    way that Brown used probes to test servers for open relays. #    Although another ISP agreed to host ORBS soon afterward, Brown's #    detractors say that he never learned his lesson: He repeatedly #    insisted that he had the right to test servers as often as he #    wanted.
#    #    "Alan Brown created some nice technology -- nobody faults him #    on that point," says Tom Geller, founder of Suespammers.org, #    a nonprofit group that lobbies for strict spam legislation. "But #    he used it in an irresponsible way, invading others' private #    networks and using others' resources against their stated wishes." #    He became a living contradiction -- a man who, says Geller, "used #    others' network resources to prove that it's wrong to use others' #    network resources."
#    #    Before the scourge of spam, the Net was a less contentious place. #    Until the early '90s, open relays were not uncommon. In fact, #    they were the norm.
#    #    "I remember when you'd get funny looks for running a mail server #    that wasn't an open relay," says "Der Mouse," a Canadian #    spam-fighting veteran who refused to give his off-line name. #    "I remember when there was a machine on the Net that was #    advertised as having no password on its administrative log-in. #    Want a guest log-in? Log in and create yourself one. I remember #    when the Net was a friendly and civilized place."
#    #    "Today it is more of an armed camp, suspicious of everyone," #    he continues in an e-mail. "The Net I knew and loved is dead, #    killed by uncivilized greedy incompetents who came barging in, #    without caring that when you barge into a foreign culture it #    behooves you to learn how they do things. This would not have #    been a problem, except that they arrived in sufficient numbers #    to overload the mechanisms that normally would have either brought #    newcomers up to speed on the culture or rejected them; as a result #    they killed off the culture we had, the only culture I've ever #    seen work based on mutual friendship and helpfulness on a large #    scale."
#    #    Spam signified the death of the original Net culture, Der Mouse #    and others argue. By the mid-'90s, systems administrators started #    fighting it by closing off open relays. Shutting the pipes made #    it harder for, say, employees of a company to log on to their #    corporate network from home, but by limiting who could use the #    network, closed relays also kept spammers out. This, in turn, #    saved companies and individuals money, since open relays #    essentially let anyone borrow servers and bandwidth without having #    to pay for them.
#    #    But some network administrators moved slower than others. So #    ORBS appeared, with a mission to move them along. At first, most #    people on the Net welcomed the service. Open relays were sometimes #    hard to find, and ORBS worked more quickly than other #    spam-fighting lists. The Mail Abuse Prevention System's Realtime #    Blackhole List, for example, acts like an after-the-fact plug. #    Its main list contains domain names that spam has already been #    sent from, and MAPS only adds servers to its list after the system #    administrator of the offending mail server has been given a chance #    to close the hole but hasn't done it.
#    #    ORBS, on the other hand, "tested relays and listed them #    immediately," says William James, a computer consultant in #    Mississippi. "No negotiation, no notice. It was fast. Someone #    running an open relay ran the risk of losing a substantial amount #    of traffic without any notice."
#    #    Over time, however, Brown's pace and intensity started alienating #    the very people who sympathized with his cause. John Oliver, #    a systems administrator in San Diego, remembers butting heads #    with Brown in early 1999. ORBS probes invaded his servers and #    tested them for 45 minutes, over and over again. The probes #    returned and retested a few days or weeks later, "as often and #    as frequently as they saw fit," Oliver says.
#    #    Each day that the tests ran, Oliver's server logs lengthened. #    He received pages and pages of server activity that directly #    resulted from Brown's tests. "It was annoying because since I #    wasn't running an open relay, it was wasting my time," he says. #    "And, of course, I didn't appreciate the implicit accusation #    that I was an irresponsible admin."
#    #    Brown regularly tested servers without any evidence of wrongdoing, #    says Der Mouse. "Let me be precise: He repeatedly 'tested' my #    home mail server, and if he had any reason to think it had ever #    relayed spam, he steadfastly refused to produce it," he says. #    "He also repeatedly did so after I explicitly denied him #    permission to do so."
#    #    MAPS also had a run-in with ORBS. In 1999, MAPS listed ORBS on #    its Realtime Blackhole List, in response to several complaints #    about the way that ORBS was supposedly abusing networks. The #    group removed ORBS and stopped blocking it from its own servers #    three months later, but not before ORBS threw MAPS into its own #    black hole. Even Suespammers.org found itself blocked over a #    dispute with ORBS. Until the day the list died, spam fighters #    who used Brown's list couldn't access the Suespammers site, a #    major resource that might have helped them in their war on #    unsolicited e-mail.
#    #    "Alan's problem is that he was so convinced that testing was #    necessary that he felt that anyone who didn't want him testing #    their systems, as often as he wanted to, was somehow just as #    bad as an actual open relay," says Peter Seebach, a systems #    administrator who subscribes to several spam-fighting mailing #    lists. "This is where I drew the line; without any spam coming #    through a system, and with the admin's request that he not test #    it, he had no business hitting systems over and over again. I #    don't see a meaningful distinction between what he did and what #    script kiddies do with root scripts" that attempt to break into #    a system.
#    #    Is what ORBS did really so bad? In essence, ORBS was nothing #    more than a list of servers that Brown checked and decided to #    block from connecting with his network -- which is one suggested #    recipe for spam fighting. Doesn't Brown have the right to protect #    his network by blocking whomever he wants to? Doesn't he have #    the right to publish a list of whom he's blocking?
#    #    People who rail against Brown are ignoring the implications of #    their argument, says "Afterburner," manager of the e-mail abuse #    department for a large ISP. ORBS may have been run "in a #    particularly unethical way," he says, but that doesn't mean that #    Brown should be silenced.
#    #    Rather, everyone should have "the unfettered right to publish" #    a blacklist, regardless of how it is organized, he says. Probes #    don't damage a network, and "nobody is required to use your list #    if they don't want to," he says. "The situation is somewhat #    analogous to the idealized free market: If you put out a list #    that's worth using, people will use it. If you put out a list #    that is not worth using, people will not use it."
#    #    But ORBS doesn't quite fit Afterburner's paraphrase of the #    libertarian ideal. The list was worth using; blocking the servers #    ORBS listed cut down on spam. Yet those who used the list as #    a tool against unwanted e-mail didn't necessarily have to pay #    the costs, which came in the form of ORBS's probes. In other #    words, Brown's approach looks a lot like a spammer's: He invaded #    others' networks without consent, offering benefits without costs.
#    #    Even worse, critics argue, Brown went one step further, blocking #    servers that didn't have open relays, and adding them to a list #    that he knew would keep traffic from them. There is, for example, #    the Xtra Mail lawsuit in New Zealand, which Brown's critics say #    was a direct result of Brown's unethical practices.
#    #    Essentially, Brown added Actrix and Xtra Mail's servers to his #    blacklist after they blocked his probes. He reportedly had no #    evidence that they used open relays. Actrix and Xtra Mail sued, #    and on May 24 they won. The New Zealand High Court ordered Brown #    to remove Xtra Mail's servers from the ORBS database.
#    #    Brown then said that he would comply, but he remained unrepentant. #    "ORBS policy is that if you threaten ORBS you'll be manually #    listed," he said, according to a story in IDG New Zealand. #    "Telecom [Actrix and Xtra Mail's parent company] threatened me #    with legal action for two years."
#    #    Those who have tangled with Brown aren't surprised at his stance. #    And they don't have a problem with his philosophy, or with his #    argument that he has a right to form a policy and block whomever #    he wants. They argue, however, that the policy has to be carried #    out with honesty.
#    #    "The list wasn't what it was purported to be," says Oliver, of #    San Diego. "If you employ a list called the Open Relay Behavior #    Modification System to protect your server from spam, you expect #    that list to block open relays and nothing else. But that isn't #    what you got with ORBS. You got open relays blocked as well as #    anyone who had attracted the personal enmity of Mr. Brown."
#    #    Ultimately, Oliver says, the Net should be glad to see ORBS go #    because it lacked the basic values of the old Internet -- truth, #    respect and freedom. "It's extremely dangerous to support the #    use of a tool when the cost for its use includes the loss of #    a liberty," he says.
#    #    Still, many of Brown's critics argue that ORBS's technology #    shouldn't go to waste. The list is already mirrored on at least #    one site, and some predict that another administrator -- someone #    with a bit more restraint -- will clean it up and maintain it. #    If he or she does, perhaps that individual, and other #    technologists, will learn from Brown's mistakes, says Geller #    at Suespammers.org.
#    #    "Any technical endeavor that ignores social aspects is doomed #    to failure," he says. "It's like making soup without liquid."

#    #    Court Rules Against Heat-Sensor Searches
#    #    Filed at 11:03 a.m. ET
#    #    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police violate the Constitution if they use #    a heat-sensing device to peer inside a home without a search #    warrant, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
#    #    An unusual lineup of five justices voted to bolster the Fourth #    Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and threw #    out an Oregon man's conviction for growing marijuana.
#    #    Monday's ruling reversed a lower court decision that said #    officers' use of a heat-sensing device was not a search of Danny #    Lee Kyllo's home and therefore they did not need a search warrant.
#    #    In an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, by many measures #    the most conservative member of the court, the majority found #    that the heat detector allowed police to see things they otherwise #    could not.
#    #    ``Where, as here, the government uses a device that is not in #    general public use to explore details of the home that would #    previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the #    surveillance is a 'search' and is presumptively unreasonable #    without a warrant,'' Scalia wrote.
#    #    While the court has previously approved some warrantless searches, #    this one did not meet tests the court has previously set, Scalia #    wrote.
#    #    The decision means the information police gathered with the #    thermal device -- namely a suspicious pattern of hot spots on #    the home's exterior walls -- cannot be used against Kyllo.
#    #    The court sent the case back to lower courts to determine whether #    police have enough other basis to support the search warrant #    that was eventually served on Kyllo, and thus whether any of #    the evidence inside his home can be used against him.
#    #    Justices Clarence Thomas, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg #    and Stephen Breyer joined the majority.
#    #    Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion joined by #    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Sandra Day #    O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.

#    #    Under Chong's vision, the Benevolent United Radical Party (BURP) #    has adopted a political agenda that's considered 'extreme' even #    by political extremists. At present, BURP has publicly committed, #    through printing of its party agenda, to:

#    Posted June 5th, 2001 11:30 AM
#    #    Feds Accused of Hiding Accidental D.C. Blast Explosive FBI Coverup
#    #    As if the FBI hadn't taken a big enough hit for its handling #    of documents in the Oklahoma City bombing trials, Soldier of #    Fortune Magazine is set to report in its August issue that #    munitions stored at the bureau's Hoover Building headquarters #    in Washington, D.C., blew up in 1987.
#    #    The blast is said to have gutted the crime lab and destroyed #    evidence in several major cases.
#    #    In recent months, the lab itself has been under attack, especially #    for its slipshod analysis of the Oklahoma City bombing. According #    to Soldier of Fortune, the feds covered up the D.C. explosion #    by saying it was a fire in a broom closet.
#    #    Freelancer J.D. Cash, a reporter for the eastern Oklahoma #    McCurtain Gazette, said he stumbled onto the story of the FBI #    explosion when he interviewed rescue workers who said they'd #    seen munitions inside the Murrah Federal Building. He later #    queried an ATF agent about why the feds would store explosives #    in a public place, and remembers the agent laughingly saying #    it was a common practice and had actually resulted in an explosion #    at FBI headquarters.
#    #    That led Cash, joined by the former network TV producer and #    investigator for the Timothy McVeigh defense team, Roger Charles, #    to submit Freedom of Information inquiries to the FBI. Four years #    later, the agency made available its internal report, along with #    photos.
#    #    The McCurtain Gazette is in the process of putting the findings #    on its Web site. In addition, Soldier of Fortune will include #    excerpts from the 197-page report. They indicate that in the #    predawn hours of May 5, 1987, military explosives-including #    Soviet-made rocket-propelled grenades-ripped through evidence #    lockers at the crime lab. The authors claim the FBI report #    acknowledged that lab personnel ignored cardboard boxes sitting #    on the floor. These contained some 22 pounds of the explosive #    C4, numerous blasting caps, and several pounds of TNT.
#    #    Reached on Monday, FBI spokesperson Bill Carter gave a limited #    account of the incident. "It was a fire," he said. "It occurred #    in the FBI lab, in the explosive unit. It wasn't an explosion, #    not a traditional explosion. The fire did cause some damage, #    and it was in the middle of the night. I still remember it. I #    came in and the fire engines were here."
#    #    Cash and Charles write that the internal FBI document describes #    a firestorm that "threatened the lives of FBI personnel and #    firefighters, as missiles and shrapnel blasted through evidence #    cabinets and tore gaping holes in the walls of the world-famous #    crime lab."

#    #    State To Expand Son of Sam Law
#    #    JUNE 14TH, 2001
#    #    State lawmakers and Governor George Pataki say they have made #    a deal to expand New York's so-called Son of Sam law that allows #    crime victims to sue for compensation from their attackers.
#    #    Under the current version, victims can only sue criminals for #    profits made from a crime, such as proceeds from a book or a #    movie deal.
#    #    Under the proposed change, victims would be able to sue for any #    money the criminal may have, including income, inheritance, #    investments and even lottery winnings. Victims will also get #    more time to file a lawsuit.
#    #    The measure is expected to be approved next week.
#    #    The original law was enacted in 1977 to prevent serial killer #    David Berkowitz, a.k.a. Son of Sam, from profiting by his #    notoriety.
Look what snuck into this bill:
#    The bill would expand the databank of DNA samples the state takes #    from people convicted of violent crimes to include people #    convicted of all crimes, including misdemeanors.

#    #    Governor to Seek Harsher Penalties for Perjurers in Criminal #    Cases
#    #    By RICHARD Pï¿½REZ-PEï¿½A
#    #    LBANY, June 12 - Responding to notorious cases of innocent people #    being convicted of crimes on the basis of false testimony, Gov. #    George E. Pataki plans to propose tougher penalties for perjury #    in criminal cases, aides to the governor said today.
#    #    Mr. Pataki will call for the creation of a crime of aggravated #    perjury, applicable only to testimony in criminal cases, and #    punishable by up to 15 years in prison, the aides said. Current #    law makes no distinction between perjury in criminal and civil #    cases, and it carries a maximum penalty of seven years.
#    #    Under the governor's proposal, there would be no statute of #    limitations for aggravated perjury, so that people could be #    prosecuted no matter how many years later their lies came to #    light. For perjury, the statute of limitations is five years.
#    #    Officials in the governor's office said the proposal, which he #    will make public on Wednesday, was prompted by several highly #    publicized cases in the last few years of people claiming to #    have witnessed crimes sending innocent defendants to prison.
#    #    One man, Dana Garner, has admitted to lying on the witness stand #    in three Brooklyn cases, sending two men to prison for murder #    and one for kidnapping; in one case he claimed to have seen a #    killing take place in Brooklyn at a time when he was in North #    Carolina. Two of the three have been freed.
#    #    "The impetus behind the governor's proposal is the recognition #    that perjury in criminal trials is an extraordinarily serious #    crime that can have enduring effects," said James McGuire, counsel #    to Mr. Pataki. "When there is proof of perjury, the integrity #    of the criminal justice system demands that prosecutions should #    be brought in appropriate cases."
#    #    But defense lawyers who were involved in those cases said the #    governor's proposal would make it harder to exonerate inmates #    convicted on false testimony, not easier.
#    #    "This would discourage people from coming forward and admitting #    to perjury," said Michelle Fox, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who #    helped clear Jeffrey Blake, one of the men convicted of murder #    on Mr. Garner's testimony. "In the Blake case, I actually sent #    a copy of the statute of limitations to Dana Garner to show him #    that he couldn't be punished for coming forward, which he was #    very afraid of."
#    #    Mr. McGuire called that "a speculative and ill-founded objection," #    in part because district attorneys can offer witnesses immunity #    from prosecution if they come forward to change their testimony. #    "I don't think that there's any real likelihood that any of those #    people who are recanting are acting with a knowledge of whether #    there's a statute of limitations or not," he said. "They're #    motivated by conscience."
#    #    Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, said through #    a spokesman, Kevin Davitt, that he supports the governor's plan. #    Mr. Davitt said that in several instances, when convictions were #    overturned years later, "We would have liked to prosecute those #    witnesses for perjury, but we couldn't."
#    #    The defense lawyer Ronald Kuby said he, like Ms. Fox, opposed #    the idea, adding, "What we need is a statewide second-look unit #    that would review cases where there's a question about guilt."
#    #    Mr. Kuby recently secured the freedom of two men who were #    convicted of murder based on the perjured testimony of a crack #    addict seeking a reward.
#    #    The governor's proposal would also apply to people who falsely #    testify to protect defendants - witnesses who provide phony #    alibis, for instance. Many lawyers say that is a far more common #    practice than lying to convict someone.
#    #    Mr. McGuire said removing the statute of limitations could give #    prosecutors a second chance at some defendants. If, years after #    an acquittal, new evidence of guilt is found, a prosecutor might #    be able to use that evidence to build a perjury case.
#    #    The governor, a Republican, will add the perjury provisions to #    a bill he has already submitted to the Legislature that focuses #    on uses of DNA evidence in court, a bill that has been stalled #    in the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
#    #    The bill would expand the databank of DNA samples the state takes #    from people convicted of violent crimes to include people #    convicted of all crimes, including misdemeanors. It would also #    eliminate the statute of limitations for some violent crimes, #    including rape. And it would create a state committee to determine #    how DNA evidence can be used, systematically, to prevent and #    reverse false convictions.

Hold on while I unslime myself from
that barrage of Choatian Crap.
Boundary Blockhead Brett Benson, a 73% vote winning Republican
elected along with the Bush-ster.
  [snipped]
#    Boundary County Prosecutor Brett Benson announced Thursday he #    will dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge filed by his #    [Republican] predecessor. He said it was unlikely the state
#    could prove the case and too much time had passed.
I guess it's okay to shoot at the back of someone going through
a door of a wooden shack containing women and children.
To kill.
Timothy McVeigh, among others (i.e. Congressional hearings),
did indeed force the U.S. government to reconsider its
confrontational ways.
Let us remember this BATF/FBI operation once more.
The U.S. Department of Justice...
Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge.
Persisting, a BATF informant persuaded Weaver, a DECORATED GREEN BERET
VETERAN of Vietnam with NO CRIMINAL RECORD, to sell him two shotguns,
but insisted that Weaver saw the barrels off one-quarter inch short of
the legal limit.
Monitoring him, they knew Mr. Weaver needed money for his family.
Why did the government target Mr. Weaver?
One of the FBI's favorite activities is spying on political organizations.
They wanted to use him to infiltrate white supremacists groups for the
government. Or face prosecution.
When Weaver refused, he was indicted on guns charges. He was sent two
conflicting court appearance dates. He became paranoid the Government
was out to get him, so he didn't show up. [He was eventually acquitted
of all charges except the original not showing up in court!]
To justify a militaristic retaliation, BATF agents lied to the U.S.
attorney's office. BATF agents claimed that Weaver had a criminal record
and that he was a suspect in several bank robberies.
Both charges were fabrications, even according to BATF Director John Magaw,
who admitted the accusations were "inexcusable" in testimony before Congress.
THREE HUNDRED armed federal agents conducted a siege of the Weavers' mountain
home, first killing Randy Weaver's dog, then his son, then his wife.
A law enforcement wilding.
*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*   *   The Marshals, wearing camouflage and carrying silenced machine guns, did
*   not identify themselves or their purpose, but they did shoot one of the
*   dogs. Sammy Weaver, fourteen-years-old, returned fire, and was promptly
*   shot by a Marshal.
*   Sammy turned and fled, with his nearly severed arm flopping as he ran.
*   Sammy was promptly shot dead in the back.
An FBI sniper, Lon T. Horiuchi, testified he could hit a quarter at 200 yards.
*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*   An FBI psychological profile, prepared before the attack, called Vicki
*   Weaver the "dominant member" of the family, thus implying that if she
*   were "neutralized" everyone else might surrender.
Horiuchi shot Weaver's wife in the head while she held her baby.
Her head exploded.
Her dead body was laid out on the cabin floor, covered with a blanket:
*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*   During the next week, "the FBI used megaphones to taunt the family.
*   'Good Morning Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for breakfast. What did
*   you have?'" asked the FBI agents in at least one exchange.
*   Weaver's daughter, Sarah, 16, said the baby, Elisheba, was often
*   crying for her mother's milk when the FBI messages were heard.
The Justice Department's own report recommended criminal prosecution of
federal agents; the surviving Weavers won $3.1 million in civil damages
from U.S. taxpayers.
Deval Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, and
Louis Freeh, Director of the FBI, took no serious action.
Larry Potts was the senior official in charge of the operation. Not only
was he not prosecuted, Freeh promoted him to acting deputy FBI director.
*   "Documents Were Destroyed as FBI Resisted Siege Investigation, Report Says"
*   By David Johnston, July 16, 1995
*   Mr. Pott's former subordinate Michael Kahoe admitted he destroyed key
*   documents on the Ruby Ridge assault. The Justice department reports
*   documents were destroyed and missing. "We are troubled by the apparent
*   lack of a system to preserve such critical records."
*   The Justice Department, in a March 18, 1993 memo stated, "the FBI's
*   intransigence appears to EMANATE from Larry Potts level OR ABOVE."
Larry Potts was a buddy of Louis Freeh. Within the FBI, these special
people are called "FOL" - Friends of Louie. [NYT 5/11/97]
Janet Reno (who had veto power over the promotion) testified what happened
at Ruby Ridge wasn't enough to cause her to veto the promotion, foreshadowing
her actions at Waco.
After two months, controversy (as opposed to events) over Potts' role in
Ruby Ridge prompted Freeh to remove him from the position, to politically
cover his own tush.
Potts and four other top FBI officials have been suspended while a federal
criminal probe investigates the destruction of documents related to the
A total of twelve agents were disciplined. None have yet been prosecuted.
The Federal government subsequently named after a U.S. Marshal who was
killed, but who also shot Randy Weaver's son dead in the back: a new
Marshals training center.
The Federal government's behavior in the incident can only be described as
sickening: targeting a citizen (a veteran, no less) who committed no crime
AND EVEN HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD (but had politically incorrect views) for
blackmail, then acting vengefully when he wouldn't act as their rat fink.
Shoot-to-kill. Sniper team.  Military fatigues.
A terrorizing organization: how else to explain the cruel cruel taunting.
A terrorist organization by virtue of shoot-to-kill orders.

#    #    Week of June 13 - 19, 2001
#    #    Radio Can't Even Play My Jam
#    #    Eminem is a man of many guises, but is he ready to be the new #    Mapplethorpe? On June 1, the FCC fined Colorado radio station #    KKMG $7000 for playing the "clean" version of Em's "The Real #    Slim Shady," the same one played thousands of times last summer #    by pop, rock, and r&b stations around the country-maybe the first #    time all those formats agreed on a No. 1.
#    #    The commission-now chaired by Colin Powell's son Michael-found #    that the song contains "sexual references in conjunction with #    sexual expletives that appear intended to pander and shock," #    a description the artist could hardly dispute; in fact, the #    indecency standard is practically the subject of the song.
#    #    "Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't/But #    it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose," reads the #    transcript of the offending track in the FCC's decision. "My #    bum is on your lips . . . /And if I'm lucky you might just give #    it a little kiss/And that's the message we deliver to little #    kids/And expect them not to know what a woman's BLEEP is?"
#    #    "I think all of America should feel threatened," says Def Jam #    founder Russell Simmons, who will lead a "hip-hop summit" this #    week at the Hilton. Last week Simmons received a Father of the #    Year award from the National Father's Day Committee at the #    Marriott Marquis, and found that Powell was a co-honoree.
#    #    According to Simmons, Powell said he'd like to come to the summit, #    but on Friday Powell's staff called to say he had a scheduling #    conflict. "He said [this fine] was just a random case, and not #    to view it as an attack, but that's bullshit," Simmons says. #    "I asked him how the record was indecent, and he couldn't give #    me a clear answer." (The FCC declined comment.)
#    #    Kathleen Kirby, KKMG's lawyer, isn't surprised. "FCC indecency #    rules are difficult to get your arms around, even for the agency's #    own attorneys." Nonetheless, she calls the fine "unusual" and #    says the station will appeal. Earlier this year, the commission #    imposed an equal fine on a Wisconsin station for "accidentally" #    playing the album version of "Slim Shady."
#    #    Kirby is cautious about gauging the political implications of #    the fine. Powell was appointed by Clinton-Bush named him chair #    days after the inauguration-and is known as a strong advocate #    of the First Amendment, while Gloria Tristani, the other remaining #    Clinton appointee, has pushed for more aggressive indecency #    enforcement. Neither was involved in issuing the fine, which #    was imposed by career civil service employees in the FCC's newly #    created enforcement bureau.
#    #    Will other stations be fined? FCC enforcement actions are driven #    by complaints from listeners, and the agency won't tell Kirby #    whether it has received any others.
#    #    "This is probably a result of pressure from this organization," #    says Paul McGeady, director of Morality in Media's National #    Obscenity Law Center on the Upper West Side, which lobbied #    Congress during the first few months of Bush II for stepped-up #    enforcement.
#    #    But even McGeady can't pinpoint what's wrong with the clean #    version. "The whole thing is offensive. It's got bestiality; #    he's talking about a vagina-what more do you need?"
#    #    Actually, the bleeped word is "clitoris," and the question Eminem #    poses is similar to the one his lawyers will raise. "The Supreme #    Court said in the Pacifica case that the FCC can bar the 'seven #    dirty words' because radio is a uniquely pervasive medium that #    is particularly accessible to children," says Northern Kentucky #    University law prof Kenneth Katkin (who has done work for Kirby's #    firm).
#    #    "But this looks a lot more like the FCC trying to decide what #    ideas kids can hear, and even the FCC would agree that's #    unconstitutional." Kids with Web browsers can find the complete #    lyrics of the "dirty" version on the FCC's own Web site,
#    #        #    #    along with shock-jock pedophilia jokes, lots of cusswords, and #    oral-sex tips from Monty Python. -Josh Goldfein

#    #    IE 6 beta pushes ad networks on privacy
#    #    By STEFANIE OLSEN, CNET NEWS.COM
#    #    As Microsoft puts the finishing touches on an upgrade to its #    popular browser, Internet advertising companies are racing to #    ensure that their ads and cookies are compatible with it.
#    #    Internet Explorer 6, scheduled to be released in August, will #    be the first browser to support a new privacy standard called #    Platform Privacy Preferences, or P3P.
#    #    With P3P, Web surfers can configure their browsers to #    automatically determine whether a Web site collects personally #    identifiable information, uses that information to create user #    profiles, or allows visitors to opt out of the data collection.
#    #    Ad networks also must post privacy policies that can be read #    by the browser. Sites and ads that are not compliant with the #    standards being included in IE 6 may not be able to place cookies #    on PC users' hard drives.
#    #    "In order for ad networks to continue to set cookies on people's #    computers, they'll have to create a P3P privacy policy--many #    haven't done that yet," said Richard Smith, chief technology #    officer at the Privacy Foundation, a Denver-based watchdog group #    and research foundation. Smith said that by his count, about #    50 to 100 marketers and ad networks set third-party cookies, #    many of which could be blocked by users of IE 6.
#    #    "All those guys are going to have to hustle to get a P3P privacy #    policy in place or their cookies won't work," Smith said.
#    #    The issue recently came to light when some of the 500,000 beta #    testers of Windows XP noticed that some ads were not being #    displayed while surfing the Web. Windows XP, an upgrade to the #    Windows operating system that will be released in October, #    includes IE 6.
#    #    Because cookies are an important component of online advertising, #    leading ad networks such as DoubleClick and Engage are working #    to ensure compatibility with IE 6.
#    #    DoubleClick, for example, uses cookies to create anonymous #    profiles on consumers who visit specific sites or content areas, #    such as sports pages or financial sites. With this information, #    the company might target a Nike ad to a consumer surfing a retail #    site who regularly visits sports Web sites.
#    #    Engage, which serves ads for about 3,400 Web sites, is installing #    headers so that the browser will be able to read Engage cookies. #    Complying with P3P is a "fairly significant expenditure of a #    couple of people's time but it's not overly burdensome," said #    Engage spokesman Mark Horan.
#    #    "Our site will be P3P-compliant within the next three weeks," #    he added. "Much more important, our cookies will be P3P-compliant #    before IE 6 launches this fall."
#    #    Jules Polonetsky, DoubleClick's privacy chief, said his company #    also will have its privacy policy and cookie headers ready before #    the launch of IE 6.
#    #    Meanwhile, the default privacy controls for IE 6 could spell #    trouble for some companies that are late in meeting P3P #    compliance.
#    #    The default setting in IE 6 allows a "first-party" cookie to #    be set, meaning that if a person visits Yahoo the browser will #    accept a cookie from Yahoo.
#    #    However, "third-party" cookies--most often set by marketers or #    ad networks to track consumer response to promotions--will be #    allowed through IE 6 default settings only if the third party #    allows consumers to opt out of data-collection practices. If #    the company doesn't give consumers an option, the cookie will #    be blocked.
#    #    DoubleClick's Polonetsky noted the company does not collect #    personally identifiable information with its cookies and does #    offer consumers an opt out, so its cookies will be accepted under #    IE 6 default settings.
#    #    "This is a great step for protecting consumers' privacy on the #    Web," said Rick Miller, a Microsoft spokesman. "Consumers will #    be able to control what personal information they give out to #    marketers."
#    #    DoubleClick's Polonetsky, who helped to develop the P3P standard, #    said that although his company will be prepared for the new #    settings, many online companies may run into trouble come August.
#    #    "Here's the surprise: Many Web sites, especially complicated #    ones with third-party content provided by their affiliates, may #    discover that they are third parties on their own sites," #    Polonetsky said. This would create a situation where their cookies #    would not be accepted on their own properties.
#    #    However, Smith said that this will not likely be a problem for #    many sites because they work fine without cookies, which makes #    targeting ads more difficult but not impossible.

#    #    June 21, 2001
#    #    Consumers Union Project Aims
#    To Rate Credibility of Web Sites
#    #    By STEPHANIE MILES
#    WSJ.COM
#    #    Consumers Union, long a trusted name in rating consumer products, #    offers online shoppers a window into electronic-commerce sites' #    business, security and privacy policies. Now the group wants #    to measure another critical component of a Web site: credibility.
#    #    The Web Credibility Project, launched earlier this month, will #    focus on how health, travel, advocacy, news and shopping sites #    disclose business relationships with the companies and products #    they cover or sell, especially when these relationships pose #    a potential conflict of interest. Eventually, the group hopes #    to draft credibility guidelines to be integrated into #    ConsumerReports.org ( the online entity #    of Consumer Reports.
#    #    The group has some lofty goals, such as targeting drug companies #    who fail to adequately inform consumers about side effects and #    indications for drugs promoted online. But it also will focus #    on more mundane issues, such as convincing shopping and e-commerce #    sites to display business addresses and phone numbers prominently.
#    #    "It's about trying to find a way to get major media and major #    e-commerce folks -- people who have a real stake in making sure #    the Web is a credible place to do business -- to agree to a set #    of standards," says Beau Brendler, director of the project. Mr. #    Brendler was previously editorial director at Walt Disney Co. #    Internet Group's ABCNews.com.
#    #    While praising the motives behind Consumers Union's latest effort, #    some wonder if credibility can be evaluated as easily as everyday #    consumer goods such as cars and appliances.
#    #    "Transparency, as a rule, is a good thing. How you actually #    accomplish that, I don't know," says Wendell Cochran, director #    of the journalism division at American University in Washington, #    D.C. "It should be incumbent on a site to give as much information #    as they could about who they are. But beyond that, credibility #    comes out of a company's performance over a long period of time."
#    #    Open Disclosure
#    #    In devising a set of voluntary standards for Web sites, the #    project aims to tackle concerns that consumers browsing cyberspace #    don't always see potential conflicts of interest between Web-site #    operators and the information they present.
#    #    Consider ibreathe.com ( At first glance, #    ibreathe appears to be an independent health-information site, #    serving up advice about asthma, allergies and other respiratory #    ailments, but visitors have to scroll to the bottom of the page #    to learn that the site is operated by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. #    Consumers interested in asthma medications, for example, are #    provided with information on GlaxoSmithKline drugs.
#    #    GlaxoSmithKline believes the site is clear about its ties to #    the drug company.
#    #    "The sponsorship is apparent when one goes to the Web site," #    says Lisa Behrens, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline, noting #    that GlaxoSmithKline is a member of the Internet Healthcare #    Coalition, which is focused on online ethics for health-infor
#    mation sites. "There is nothing that in anyway suggests that #    this is third-party or independent information," Ms. Behrens #    says.
#    #    Still, the company is open to the suggestions of the Web #    Credibility Project. "If there's any entity -- Consumers' Union #    or others -- who has feedback or suggestions for GlaxoSmithKline, #    I'm sure we'd welcome it," Ms. Behrens says.
#    #    But the question of how to come to a consensus on credibility #    issues can be tricky. Another example offered by Consumers Union's #    Mr. Brendler is the Web site of Keep America Beautiful #    ( Mr. Brendler calls Keep America Beautiful an #    example of an "astroturf" site -- one that looks like a #    grass-roots organization's Web outpost, but is in fact backed #    by a corporate or advocacy group.
#    #    Mr. Brendler's prescription for making KAB.org more credible #    is for the site to more prominently link to or display the names #    of its corporate backers, which Mr. Brendler says include "200 #    companies that manufacture aluminum cans, paper goods, glass #    bottles and plastics," such as Bethlehem Steel Corp., American #    Forest & Paper Association, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., #    Pacific Gas & Electric and Philip Morris Cos.
#    #    Walt Amacker, vice president and director of communications at #    Keep America Beautiful, disagrees that KAB.org is disingenuous #    about its backers. The site does include a comprehensive and #    easy-to-find list of donors, accessible by two mouse clicks, #    he says, which includes "anybody who's given any money through #    corporations or foundations through January 2001."
#    #    Although the sponsorship information may not be accessible where #    most visitors would expect it to be -- under the heading "About #    KAB," for example -- the group does provide a detailed list of #    its corporate backers in the section of the site devoted to #    fund-raising.
#    #    KAB has never shied away from revealing its corporate backers, #    Mr. Amacker says, because part of the purpose of the nonprofit #    group is to educate communities about how to prevent litter, #    toxic dumping and other misuse of industrial products. Mr. Amacker #    points out that KAB was rated "most credible" in a 1998 survey #    of environmental organizations conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide, #    a research and consulting group.
#    #    Standards Needed
#    #    The idea for creating a set of credibility standards grew out #    of a panel discussion at a 1998 conference sponsored by the #    Project for Excellence in Journalism and Pew Charitable Trusts.
#    #    Consumers Union received $4.8 million in grants to launch the #    Web Credibility Project, including $2.7 million from Pew #    Charitable Trusts, $2 million from the Knight Foundation and #    $100,000 from the Open Society Institute.
#    #    Consumers Union has shown it understands the online world, #    launching ConsumerReports.org in 1997. Online subscriptions cost #    $24 a year or $3.95 a month; subscribers to Consumer Reports #    magazine are charged an additional $19 a year for the online #    version. The site has more than 560,000 subscribers, making it #    one of the more successful premium online properties.
#    #    Lately, the site has been branching out, offering its reports #    through e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc., CNET Networks #    Inc. and Yahoo Inc.
#    #    There are already a variety of services, including comparison
#    -shopping guides such as BizRate.com Inc. and nonprofit #    consumer-protection organizations like the Better Business #    Bureau's BBBOnline, that are dedicated to promoting responsibility #    online.
#    #    BizRate, which provides its e-commerce ratings information to #    ConsumerReports.org, says it is in favor of the new project and #    doesn't see it interfering with its own services. For the month #    of May, Bizrate.com received about 6.2 million unique visitors, #    while ConsumerReports.org had about one million visitors, #    according to Jupiter Media Metrix.
#    #    The Web Credibility Project intends to go beyond ratings. The #    group also plans to launch a Web site later this year, name an #    advisory board of journalists and e-commerce experts, work with #    groups such as the Online News Association and give out annual #    awards recognizing the most credible sites on the Web.
#    #    Online vs. Offline World
#    #    Still, measuring and regulating the credibility of Internet sites #    by asking companies to voluntarily comply with guidelines is #    a thorny issue, as the disagreement between Messrs. Brendler #    and Amacker over the credibility of the Keep America Beautiful #    site illustrates.
#    #    Although voluntary standards can "help set a tone," American #    University's Mr. Cochran says, ultimately each site is responsible #    for its own reputation. "You can put a seal of approval on #    something, but it wouldn't mean anything until enough time had #    passed, and enough circumstances had been experienced, for people #    to make up their minds."
#    #    The goal of getting sites to voluntarily disclose business #    relationships is laudable, but runs the risk of holding online #    publishers to a higher standard than offline ones, adds Phil #    Brooks, a professor at the Missouri School of Journalism, who #    notes that most movies include paid placement of products without #    disclosing the financial relationship between the studio and #    the product maker.
#    #    "It would be good if there was full, open disclosure of these #    kind of marketing practices," Mr. Brooks says. "But as a reality #    I don't see that businesses that use online services and digital #    media are going to adopt standards that are different than the #    standards that are being followed in traditional media."

#    #    Newly Revealed Documents Prove Woman Innocent of Cyanide Killings, #    PI Says
#    #    Stella Nickell has never stopped denying she killed her husband
#    Bruce with cyanide in 1986. But now her defense team says they
#    can prove her innocence.
#    #    Nickell, 57, is serving two 90-year prison terms after being #    found guilty of putting cyanide in a pain-reliever capsule taken #    by her husband and trying to hide the crime by tampering with #    other bottles of the over-the-counter drug, which resulted in #    a second death.
#    #    Her case came at a time when the country was reeling from a series #    of drug-tampering incidents.
#    #    Now, two private investigators who have been digging into the #    Seattle case for 14 months say they can prove her innocence with #    documents the FBI never turned over to the defense at the time #    of the trial.
#    #    If the claim sounds strangely familiar, think again, says Al #    Farr, one of the two sleuths who have been working on the case. #    "I know when news first got out there that we were doing this, #    some people assumed we were just floating on Tim McVeigh's #    coattails," Farr said. "That couldn't be further from the truth."
#    #    The FBI has admitted it failed to turn over more than 4,000 #    documents in the case of McVeigh, who faces the death penalty #    for the deadly Oklahoma City bombing.
#    Then, in October, he was contacted by former FBI lab worker
#    Frederic Whitehurst, who told him he had 1,000 pages of
#    FBI documents related to the case that were never seen during
#    the trial.

Hey, Declan, in your free time, find out about the encryption...
#    #    DUDLEY, Mass. (AP)  Nancy Surprise left her 7-year-old son alone #    in the car one day while she ran into the post office, and #    returned to find a 280-pound man sitting on top of the boy.
#    #    But when the man was hauled into court, Surprise says, prosecutors #    insisted the best way to handle the case would be to make him #    go far, far away.
#    #    Prosecutors cut a deal in 1991 with the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah: #    no jail time, two years of probation, and he must keep his promise #    to move to Montana and live with his mother. Bar-Jonah headed #    west.
#    And it is there that he stands accused of crimes far more #    horrifying: He is suspected of butchering a little boy and
#    serving the remains in dishes cooked up for his Montana
#    neighbors.
#    #    In 1999, Bar-Jonah was arrested outside a Great Falls, Mont., #    elementary school, again dressed as a policeman. He was carrying #    a stun gun and pepper spray.
#    #    A search of his house yielded thousands of photographs of boys. #    Investigators also found encrypted writings, which the FBI #    decoded, about "little boy stew" and "lunch is served on the #    patio with roasted child," prosecutors said. Also found was a #    list of boys from Massachusetts and Great Falls.

#    #    KKK Sues NYC
#    Klan Wants to Wear White Hoods
#    #    Norman Siegel of the New York Civil Liberties Union filed suit #    against the city and the police commissioner on behalf of the #    KKK, alleging its First Amendment rights will be violated if #    police do not issue the group a permit to hold a rally. (Ed #    Bailey/AP Photo)
#    #    By Donna De La Cruz
#    #    N E W   Y O R K, Oct. 19 -The Ku Klux Klan sued the city and #    the police department today, alleging its First Amendment rights #    to wear its traditional white hoods will be violated if the group #    is not issued a permit for a rally Saturday.
#    #    The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court on behalf of #    the KKK by the New York Civil Liberties Union. NYCLU Executive #    Director Norman Siegel said the group loathes the message of #    the KKK, which asked the NYCLU to take the case.
#    #    "But this case is an important First Amendment case," Siegel #    said. "Regardless of the message, the First Amendment says people #    have a right to express their views. They have a right to #    anonymous political activity."
#    #    The city's lawyers did not immediately respond. Two federal judges #    - Harold Baer Jr. and Alvin Hellerstein - will hear the KKK's #    case, as well as the case of one group who wants to stage a #    counterdemonstration - at 4 p.m. on Thursday.
#    #    Hoods Violate Obscure State Statute Last week, the police #    department denied the Church of the American Knights - a branch #    of the KKK - a permit to gather in front of the New York County #    Courthouse at 60 Centre Street in lower Manhattan because the #    group planned to wear its traditional white robes and hoods.
#    #    The permit was denied on the grounds that the wearing of hoods #    violates a state statute that prohibits groups of people from #    congregating in public places while wearing masks or disguising #    their faces, except for authorized masquerade parties or other #    entertainment.
#    #    Siegel, the NYCLU executive director, said that statute violates #    the First Amendment and has rarely been used since it went into #    effect 150 years ago.
#    #    In the lawsuit, the KKK contends its members wear the hoods to #    protect their identities because they've been subjected to #    retaliation because of their views. KKK National Imperial Grand #    Wizard Jeff Berry has also said the hood is part of the group's #    "religious attire."
#    #    Berry, who lives in Butler, Ind., did not return a telephone #    call for comment today.
#    #    Counterdemonstrations Planned
#    #    In the lawsuit, the KKK said it expects between 50 to 80 people #    to attend its rally, slated for 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
#    #    Three groups - the Partisan Defense Committee, the Latino Officers #    Association and a coalition of elected officials, religious #    leaders and community activists - have all applied for permits #    to stage counterdemonstrations. Police were still reviewing those #    permits today. The Partisan Defense Committee is also suing the #    city in federal court for the right to hold a counterdemonstr
#    ation.
#    #    Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said if the KKK rally and counterdemon
#    strations take place, police officers normally patrolling #    elsewhere would have to be called in to ensure that the #    demonstrations proceeded safely.
#    #    The Partisan Defense Committee has distributed about 80,000 #    leaflets about the protest citywide, said attorney Rachel #    Wolkenstein. Coalition members also hope to attract thousands.

#    #    Tech Industry Seeks Its Salvation         June 25, 2001
#    In High-Speed Internet Connections
#    #    By SCOTT THURM and GLENN R. SIMPSON
#    Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    #    High-tech executives think they've found a cure for the industry's #    deepest slump in a decade: High-speed Internet access for #    everyone.
#    #    For years, telephone and cable-TV companies have been promising #    to build high-speed "broadband" networks, which let consumers #    and small businesses tap the Internet 20 or 30 times faster than #    conventional phone lines, yet the rollout has been slow. There's #    little agreement, even within the tech world, on the ground rules #    for building such networks, which would cost tens of billions #    of dollars. But suddenly the topic has rocketed to the top of #    the technology industry's agenda in Washington, where #    traditionally distant tech executives are asking for help.
#    #    The chairmen of International Business Machines Corp., Intel #    Corp., Motorola Inc. and others last week met with key lawmakers #    and National Economic Council officials to support bills that #    would provide tax credits for building high-speed networks in #    rural areas and economically depressed inner cities. Other #    executives propose broader tax breaks, comparing broadband #    Internet links with the government-financed interstate highway #    or rural electric systems.
#    #    Likening the task to the 1960s effort to put a man on the moon, #    John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems Inc., is asking #    that the federal government commit to making broadband connections #    available to every home by 2010. A Cisco lobbyist calls the effort #    "our No. 1 goal" (although a spokesman says Mr. Chambers doesn't #    think the government would be the one to build the network).
#    #    Some tech executives argue that extending broadband networks #    would help revive the national economy, because tech spending #    contributed such a large share of economic growth in recent years. #    "The stimulation would go well beyond hardware and software #    providers," says Phil Bond, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s top Washington #    lobbyist.
#    #    But some analysts are struck by the sudden change in an industry #    that previously distanced itself from Washington. Technology #    companies "are going to Washington looking for a bailout," says #    Scott Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a #    Washington-based independent research company. "That tells you #    their situations are awfully bad because when times were good #    they were telling the government to stay away."
#    #    Monday, more than 40 tech executives are set to meet at H-P's #    Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters to rally behind the broadband #    effort and discuss possible policy initiatives. Other tech groups #    have similar efforts under way. Last week's lobbying was #    orchestrated by the Computer Systems Policy Project, which #    represents big computer companies. "The administration is #    listening carefully to all segments of industry and working with #    lawmakers and regulators to assess policy alternatives to #    accelerate broadband deployment," a White House spokesman says.
#    #    The renewed push for broadband stems from widespread disappoi
#    ntment with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was supposed #    to encourage competition, particularly for local phone service. #    But many of the upstarts that challenged the Baby Bells couldn't #    make profits and got hurt in the collapse of the high-tech bubble. #    And companies that built data networks to carry an expected flood #    of Internet traffic are starving for business.
#    #    Tech executives fear that broadband deployment will slow even #    further. A year ago, the pace was a secondary concern for big #    tech companies. Then the dot-com bubble burst. Companies cut #    their purchases of tech gear, and executives of tech companies #    faced declining sales, losses and layoffs. Now, potential sales #    resulting from a new wave of high-speed Internet connections #    look like a port in a storm.
#    #    When Mr. Chambers broached the subject before 50 executives at #    a February meeting of TechNet, an industry lobbying group, 20 #    hands shot up, according to a person who was in the room. TechNet #    quickly assembled a "working group" on broadband policy, including #    Mr. Chambers and executives from Intel, Microsoft Corp., 3Com #    Corp. and ExciteAtHome Corp. Its recommendations are expected #    in September.
#    #    Executives hope ubiquitous high-speed links can ignite another #    "virtuous cycle" of innovation and spending on tech gear, like #    the one that accompanied the first phase of the Internet in the #    late 1990s. Telecom-gear makers would sell equipment to build #    the networks. PC- and chip-makers would sell consumers new #    computers to keep up with faster connections. Software makers #    and content creators would update programs. "We're convinced #    now more than ever that broadband is crucial to our industry," #    says Peter Pitsch, an attorney in Intel's Washington office.
#    #    A unified tech industry could be influential in the national #    debate. "I've always felt the computer folks would tip the balance #    if they ever came into the thing in a serious way," says Jeffrey #    Eisenach, president of the nonprofit Progress and Freedom #    Foundation, a group backed by the Bell phone companies that is #    sponsoring the meeting at H-P.
#    #    But there's little agreement in the industry about how to get #    the job done. The differences are apparent on the central #    telecommunications question facing Congress this year: whether #    to relax 1996 rules limiting the role of Bells in building and #    operating data networks. Until recently, big tech companies were #    reluctant to take sides because they had customers in rival camps. #    Now, their reluctance may be fading.
#    #    In a speech last week, Intel Chairman Andrew Grove endorsed #    loosening some of the restrictions. That was a bit of a shift #    for the chip giant, which had invested in several Baby Bell #    challengers in the heady days after the 1996 law was passed.
#    #    "If we want to see broadband, we have to follow the money, as #    cruel and unfair as it sounds," said Mr. Grove, who lunched with #    Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Baby Bell Verizon #    Communications Inc., the following day. Mr. Grove called for #    "a new approach" in which the Bells "should be allowed to invest #    with the fair expectation of making a lot of money."
#    #    Others blame the Bells for stifling competition, then dragging #    their feet. "I'm afraid if we leave it to existing incumbents, #    the speed at which broadband will progress would not be #    satisfactory," says 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou. He suggests #    government-subsidized loans, or tax rebates for signing up #    broadband customers. Most tech lobbyists, though, consider it #    politically toxic to mention those ideas.

#    #    Monday, more than 40 tech executives are set to meet at H-P's #    Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters to rally behind the broadband #    effort and discuss possible policy initiatives. Other tech groups #    have similar efforts under way. Last week's lobbying was #    orchestrated by the Computer Systems Policy Project, which #    represents big computer companies. "The administration is #    listening carefully to all segments of industry and working with #    lawmakers and regulators to assess policy alternatives to #    accelerate broadband deployment," a White House spokesman says.
#    #    The renewed push for broadband stems from widespread disappoi
#    ntment with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was supposed #    to encourage competition, particularly for local phone service. #    But many of the upstarts that challenged the Baby Bells couldn't #    make profits and got hurt in the collapse of the high-tech bubble. #    And companies that built data networks to carry an expected flood #    of Internet traffic are starving for business.
#    #    Tech executives fear that broadband deployment will slow even #    further. A year ago, the pace was a secondary concern for big #    tech companies. Then the dot-com bubble burst. Companies cut #    their purchases of tech gear, and executives of tech companies #    faced declining sales, losses and layoffs. Now, potential sales #    resulting from a new wave of high-speed Internet connections #    look like a port in a storm.
#    #    When Mr. Chambers broached the subject before 50 executives at #    a February meeting of TechNet, an industry lobbying group, 20 #    hands shot up, according to a person who was in the room. TechNet #    quickly assembled a "working group" on broadband policy, including #    Mr. Chambers and executives from Intel, Microsoft Corp., 3Com #    Corp. and ExciteAtHome Corp. Its recommendations are expected #    in September.
#    #    Executives hope ubiquitous high-speed links can ignite another #    "virtuous cycle" of innovation and spending on tech gear, like #    the one that accompanied the first phase of the Internet in the #    late 1990s. Telecom-gear makers would sell equipment to build #    the networks. PC- and chip-makers would sell consumers new #    computers to keep up with faster connections. Software makers #    and content creators would update programs. "We're convinced #    now more than ever that broadband is crucial to our industry," #    says Peter Pitsch, an attorney in Intel's Washington office.
#    #    A unified tech industry could be influential in the national #    debate. "I've always felt the computer folks would tip the balance #    if they ever came into the thing in a serious way," says Jeffrey #    Eisenach, president of the nonprofit Progress and Freedom #    Foundation, a group backed by the Bell phone companies that is #    sponsoring the meeting at H-P.
#    #    But there's little agreement in the industry about how to get #    the job done. The differences are apparent on the central #    telecommunications question facing Congress this year: whether #    to relax 1996 rules limiting the role of Bells in building and #    operating data networks. Until recently, big tech companies were #    reluctant to take sides because they had customers in rival camps. #    Now, their reluctance may be fading.
#    #    In a speech last week, Intel Chairman Andrew Grove endorsed #    loosening some of the restrictions. That was a bit of a shift #    for the chip giant, which had invested in several Baby Bell #    challengers in the heady days after the 1996 law was passed.
#    #    "If we want to see broadband, we have to follow the money, as #    cruel and unfair as it sounds," said Mr. Grove, who lunched with #    Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Baby Bell Verizon #    Communications Inc., the following day. Mr. Grove called for #    "a new approach" in which the Bells "should be allowed to invest #    with the fair expectation of making a lot of money."
#    #    Others blame the Bells for stifling competition, then dragging #    their feet. "I'm afraid if we leave it to existing incumbents, #    the speed at which broadband will progress would not be #    satisfactory," says 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou. He suggests #    government-subsidized loans, or tax rebates for signing up #    broadband customers. Most tech lobbyists, though, consider it #    politically toxic to mention those ideas.

#    Cheney Withholds List of Those Who Spoke to Energy Panel
#    #    By JOSEPH KAHN June 26, 2001
#    #    WASHINGTON, June 25 - Vice President Dick Cheney has declined #    to identify the people who met privately with his energy task #    force, raising tensions with Congressional investigators who #    have repeatedly requested the information.
#    #    The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, #    sent Mr. Cheney's office a letter late last week complaining #    that a month had passed since it first submitted an inquiry about #    the workings of the task force. The letter said the vice president #    had a legal obligation to provide the information immediately.
#    #    Mr. Cheney's office said the letter was sent one day after it #    submitted 77 pages of documents to the accounting office.
#    #    "Our correspondence crossed in the mail," said Juleanna Glover #    Weiss, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney.
#    #    But Ms. Weiss said the vice president had not provided the names #    of people, including industry executives, who may have influenced #    the formation of the Bush administration's energy policy, which #    was released last month.
#    #    "Our counsel and the G.A.O. will continue to talk about this," #    Ms. Weiss said.
#    #    The energy task force Mr. Cheney headed spent several months #    compiling a lengthy energy strategy that contained about 150 #    recommendations for administrative and legislative actions to #    address what it termed an energy crisis.
#    #    Administration officials have said that they met with a wide #    variety of people concerned about energy issues, including #    executives of oil, natural gas, electricity, nuclear power and #    energy infrastructure companies. They have declined to provide #    a list of people who had access to the task force.
#    #    Some Democrats have asserted that leading Republican donors had #    special access to the task force and that the energy policy is #    skewed toward measures favored by major corporations. Two #    Democratic representatives, Henry A. Waxman of California and #    John D. Dingell of Michigan, asked the accounting office to report #    on the officials who served on the task force, what information #    was collected by the panel, whom they met with and how much the #    task force spent.
#    #    The White House provided the G.A.O. with the financial records #    of the task force. But administration officials have told the #    investigative body that they are not compelled to provide the #    names of outsiders who met with the task force.
#    #    The accounting office's general counsel, Anthony H. Gamboa, said #    in a letter to Mr. Cheney's office last week that the #    investigative body is entitled to more information.
#    #    The letter warned that if the White House does not provide the #    full range of information the G.A.O. is seeking, it may issue #    a "demand letter," a more formal request. Under the law, the #    White House would have 20 days to respond.
#    #    If the dispute continues, the accounting office could bring a #    civil action against the administration.

#    ...the extension of Restriction of Liberty Orders...
#    There are also plans to use the orders as a condition of a
#    probation order or a drug treatment and testing order...
#    #    THURSDAY JUNE 28 2001
#    #    All sheriff courts to have power to tag offenders
#    #    BY GILLIAN HARRIS, SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT
#    #    POLITICIANS and community leaders gave a cautious welcome #    yesterday to plans to increase the use of electronic tagging #    of offenders.
#    #    Every sheriff court in Scotland is to be given the option of #    electronically monitoring offenders under a scheme announced #    by the Scottish Executive. Iain Gray, the Deputy Justice Minister, #    unveiled details of the move during a visit to General Security #    Services Corporation Europe in East Kilbride.
#    #    Pilot schemes are already under way in Hamilton, Aberdeen and #    Peterhead and the firm has the contract to provide the electronic #    monitoring service to Hamilton Sheriff Court.
#    #    Mr Gray said 418 offenders had been electronically tagged since #    the pilot scheme was launched in August 1998. He described the #    initiative, which predominantly sees offenders limited to their #    own home for up to 12 hours a day, as a success that should be #    extended throughout Scotland.
#    #    Donald Dickie, a senior manager with the community safety #    organisation Safeguarding Communities Reducing Offending, welcomed #    the move as an alternative to custody. He said that the prison #    population in Scotland was too high and that not all offenders #    need to be locked up.
#    #    Mr Dickie also welcomed moves to use tagging for inmates released #    from prison on licence and under supervision. He said: "It has #    the potential to assist in helping people to lead stable lives."
#    #    Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's Shadow Justice Minister, gave #    the announcement a muted welcome but expressed concerns that #    no timescale had been given. She said: "I cautiously welcome #    the announcement today by the Deputy Justice Minister that #    Restriction of Liberty Orders will play a greater role in the #    criminal justice system.
#    #    "It is important, however, that these orders are used as a direct #    alternative to custody as it makes a great deal of sense both #    in terms of justice and in terms of cost."
#    #    Phil Gallie, the Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman, said #    tagging should be used as an additional tool in the fight against #    crime. He said: "Electronic tagging must not be an instrument #    with which the Scottish Executive can empty our prisons. I have #    always been an advocate for electronic tagging, however I never #    envisaged that this would provide an easy option for criminals.
#    #    "At all times our courts must ensure that punishment and #    deterrence along with protection of the public stands as the #    highest priority."
#    #    Mr Gray said the extension of Restriction of Liberty Orders, #    under which offenders are fitted with electronic transmitters #    so monitoring authorities can keep track of their movements, #    would take place once a competitive tendering exercise has been #    completed.
#    #    There are also plans to use the orders as a condition of a #    probation order or a drug treatment and testing order and for #    monitoring of prisoners released on licence under supervision #    such as sex offenders.

#    #    Malicious Code in RTF Files: Yet another Prediction Comes True
#    #    A Trojan program penetrates computers when reading RTF files
#    #    Kaspersky Lab, an international data-security software-development #    company, warns users about the discovery of the Trojan "Goga" #    that steals and sends out from infected computers user details #    for Internet access (i.e. login, password and other information). #    Kaspersky Lab has already received several reports of the Trojan #    being detected "in the wild."
#    #    "Goga" has two distinguishing features: the first is that it #    utilizes files in RTF format as a means for spreading, confusing #    users in as much as they believe these files to be absolutely #    safe, often opening them without first administering an anti-virus #    check. The second is that the Trojan exploits a well-known breach #    in the Microsoft Word security system, allowing a malefactor #    to launch a malicious code, unbeknownst to a user, immediately #    following the opening of an infected document.
#    #    Breach hyperlink:
#    #    #    #    Should a computer not be installed with the proper patch thwarting #    this breach, then when the infected RTF file is read, MS Word #    automatically downloads a template containing the malicious #    macro-program from a remote Web site without any warning #    whatsoever. This macro-program extracts additional utility from #    the RTF file?s binary section. This utility searches the infected #    computer and creates another TXT file containing user Internet #    access details. At this point, "Goga" starts up the script program #    that publishes the newely created TXT file in a Web-site guest #    book open to the general public. The virus writer is now able #    to periodically cull stolen information from this site.
#    #    Kaspersky Lab warned users about falling prey to this RTF-file #    danger on May 29. We once again recommend that users install #    the MS Word patch defending against this Trojan and any other #    malicious programs exploiting this breach ASAP.
#    Detection and removal procedures have already been added
#    to the Kaspersky Anti-Virus database daily update.

#    #    Spam war gags Gilmore
#    #    Verio cuts off EFF co-founder John Gilmore over open mail server. #    By Kevin Poulsen March 15, 2001 5:19 PM PT
#    #    Aggressive anti-spam measures by Dallas-based ISP Verio have #    stripped some of the Internet's digerati of the ability to send #    email, and EFF co-founder John Gilmore is calling it censorship.
#    #    Gilmore's home network includes what anti-spam crusaders call #    an "open relay" -- a mail server that accepts and forwards email #    from anyone. For decades, the practice was considered central #    to good network citizenship. But in recent years, spammers have #    begun hijacking open relays to multiply, sometimes a thousand #    fold, the number of junk messages they can send at once.
#    #    That abuse sparked a campaign by anti-spam activists to close #    the open relays, a campaign that Gilmore, an entrepreneur, #    electronic civil libertarian, and co-founder of the Electronic #    Frontier Foundation (EFF), has little use for.
#    #    "It reminds me of the X-ray machines they have in airports and #    the security checks they put people through," says Gilmore. "It #    doesn't actually solve the problem, it just infringes on the #    rights of the innocent."
#    #    Even as commercial ISPs began tightening down their mail servers #    -- rejecting outgoing mail from non-subscribers, and forcing #    subscribers to electronically prove their identity before sending #    mail -- Gilmore kept his own mail server open to the world, a #    service he says his friends have come to rely on.
#    #    "Part of the reason my friends are using my machine is their #    own ISPs' anti-spam measures prevent them from sending email #    as they move around in the world," says Gilmore. "If one user #    connects to my machine from an unknown address and sends a #    message, my machine forwards it on. It's happy to. That could #    be John Perry Barlow sending email from Africa to his girlfriend."
#    #    Gilmore says he shuts down spammers when he detects them, but #    acknowledges that some junk mail gets through his system. Late #    last month, one such spam message -- from a would-be entrepreneur #    offering professional spamming services to the public -- resulted #    in a complaint to Gilmore's ISP, Verio, from an anti-spam group.
#    #    Verio's sweeping acceptable-use policy prohibits open relays. #    When Gilmore refused to put fetters on his mail server, the #    company's security department slapped a filter on Gilmore's T1 #    net connection Wednesday, blocking outgoing email from his #    network.
#    #    A Verio spokesperson did not return a telephone call Thursday. #    Verio security team leader Darren Grabowski declined to comment. #    "What we do is between us and our customer," said Grabowski.
#    #    Anti-spam pressure Gilmore believes anti-spam efforts have gone #    too far, and impact the rights of innocent people. "Verio is #    filtering me because they were pressured by a pressure group, #    and they don't have enough intelligence to stand up against that #    pressure."
#    #    But the head of the anti-spam business that forwarded the #    complaint to Verio last month says the ISP did the right thing.
#    #    "It's been a very long time since open relays were considered #    acceptable on the net," says Julian Haight, owner of SpamCop.net. #    "On today's Internet, things have changed considerably."
#    #    SpamCop.net lets netizens easily and automatically track and #    report spammers and open relays, and maintains a blacklist of #    network addresses the company considers spam-friendly. Haight #    acknowledges the influence his organization, and other anti-spam #    efforts, can exert on an ISP, but he says no one has a right #    to operate a service that lends a hand to spammers.
#    #    "Freedom of speech is not 100 percent," says Haight. "You're #    not allowed to come into my home to preach to me... Open servers #    are responsible for making copies of unsolicited commercial emails #    and sending it to people who don't want it."
#    #    Gilmore argues that by making decisions about what to allow or #    disallow over their network, ISPs risk losing the common carrier #    status that protects them from legal liability for their #    customer's actions.
#    #    "Ultimately, they should be a pipe. They shouldn't care what #    content goes through. For them to say, well, we'll send your #    IP packets... except when you send this particular type of IP #    packet, it takes them out of the realm of a common carrier," #    says Gilmore. "That puts the entire Internet in jeopardy."

#    #    Child's Murder in Germany Prompts Debate Over Mandatory DNA Testing
#    #    Saturday, March 17, 2001 By Greg Palkot
#    #    The brutal murder of 12-year-old Ulrike Brandt, who went missing #    from her hometown north of Berlin last month, sparked outrage #    across Germany when her strangled and sexually abused body was #    found by authorities.
#    #    Those who knew here mourned. "It was terrible that this could #    happen," one neighbor said. "She was such a nice girl." Funeral #    services were held Friday.
#    #    The emotional case sparked a wider debate when some politicians #    called for all German men to submit to DNA testing to help find #    the girl's killer, and prevent similar crimes in the future. #    That call has been rejected by other leading officials, and #    brought back for the some the terrible memories of Germany's #    Nazi and Communist past, when individual rights were systemat
#    ically disregarded.
#    #    There is a precedent in post-Cold War Germany for such DNA #    testing, in which a saliva samples from those tested are matched #    with genetic material found on the victim. In 1998, the killer #    of another young German girl was found after more than 16,000 #    men underwent DNA testing.
#    #    This new proposal has a much wider potential impact, however, #    and could theoretically involve 41 million people.
#    #    Supporters have promised to push their case. "I am ready to go #    very far with legislation," Norbert Geis, legal spokesman for #    Germany's CDU/CSU opposition coalition told Fox News, "in order #    to catch sexual offenders against children."
#    #    Opponents of the plan argue that current German law guards against #    perceived invasions of privacy. "It's unconstitutional to take #    a fingerprint of someone not proven guilty," remarked Volcker #    Beck, Alliance 90/Green party parliament member, "so it is clear #    you can't take a genetic fingerprint, either."
#    #    Similar privacy concerns have been raised in the U.S and #    elsewhere. Still, DNA testing has had success in America, #    particularly at the state level. And Britain is moving to create #    a broader national genetic data bank.
#    #    Geis and other supporters of the DNA testing plan for Germany #    have since backed off their earlier hardline positions. But more #    extensive testing does have popular support.
#    #    "It's no problem for me," one Berlin man noted. And a young German #    woman remarked, "It's good, so long as they can find the killer."
#    #    Voluntary DNA testing in Eberswalde, where Ulrike lived, is #    already under way.

He's sooooo in love with himself.
Proof: he's the top poster.
When asked why he couldn't manage to contain himself,
by saving up all his separate little posts into a
single one and sending it out once a day, he had
nothing to say in defense.

Well, according to The News, reporting on the shutting down
of some Russian sites for KP: the U.S. government estimates
there are 100,000 WWW sites that are involved or related to KP.
Are you sure you can't find any?
Try "child pornography" (with the double quotes) at Google.
You'll see all sorts of sites for reporting KP.
Copy one or more of them, such as  into
your own new "reporting" site. You'll get direct tips as
to where KP is.
And, of course, there's Usenet.

Why have a requirement, beyond making standards?
Is that what 'NIST' stands for these days?
#    #    Various examples of surge capability are available in this

#    military capabilities, as well as to assist theater commanders in
#    understanding what "national" systems can provide and how they can
#    be tasked.  The response to NIST deployments has been
#    overwhelmingly positive.  That NIST in essence provides a type of
#    synergistic, horizontal approach to collection, suggests that such
#    an approach could be beneficial on a larger, Community scale.

Your Politech was delayed from delivering pages
because it was stuck waiting for doubleclick.net.
Not the coolest thing.

Technically you're right. It was just slightly unnerving
to think you might have descended further down the road
of selling out to the click recording factories. The URL
was on their system. But you're right, no ad or WWW bugs.
