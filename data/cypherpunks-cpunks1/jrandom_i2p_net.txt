6) ???
* 1) Net status
The 0.4.2.3 release included a whole slew of fixes and the net
handled things pretty well.  Over time we ran into a few long
standing peer selection and overload problems on duck's irc server
though, but after some patches that seems to have recovered nicely.
There are a few key modifications that have been made since 0.4.2.3
that we'll be rolling out into a 0.4.2.4 release fairly soon:
= bandwidth-based tunnel throttling
= reenabling (with some tweaks) the probabalistic dropping of
  messages under heavy congestion
= various profiling and ranking fixes
= some time sync related updates.
That last one is worth a bit more discussion, as it relates to
something we've been seeing over the last day or two.  For some
reason, we have had a small portion of the network somehow get their
clocks skewed by 5 minutes.  We've recently improved the safe and
automatic healing of the time synchronization, and there's also
some new code to proactively kick out peers whose clocks skew after
the connection is established.  These are only partial solutions
though - in the long run, we need secure NTP synchronization (or at
least synchronization within our 60s margin of error).  Before you
say it, let me just reiterate that I'd love to get rid of the clock
synchronization issue, and if you can come up with a way to do so
securely, we'll do so.
In any case, with the various fixes in place I do expect we'll have
a new 0.4.2.4 release in the next day or three, so keep your ears to
the ground.
* 2) mail.i2p
I've been hearing some whispering of some neat features coming from
mail.i2p lately, and postman has some things he wants to discuss -
swing on by the meeting and see what's up!
* 3) roadmap
No Dorothy, we aren't going to have the 1.0 release this month.
I've updated  with both revised content
and a more conservative schedule.  The old 0.4.3 release is being
placed as 0.5 and 0.4.4 is being placed as 0.6, since they're both
pretty hefty updates.  You'll also note one of 0.6's new items -
"Basic content distribution infrastructure".  Thats...
* 4) I2PContent
Frosk has been posting [1] up some really cool ideas for a content
distribution network on top of I2P, merging the old MyI2P with the
original P2P network, the only one that can push terrabytes of data
around without batting an eye and has a 20+ year track record -
Usenet.  Frosk's work on this is looking pretty exciting, so check
out the posts on his blog and get in touch with him if you want to

As announced [2] last week, duck & gang have claimed the swarming
file transfer bounty [3] with their port [4] of the original
BitTorrent to I2P!  See the announcement for more details.

5) ???
1) 0.4.2.4 & 0.4.2.5
With last week's 0.4.2.4 release, we saw the deployment of some new
load balancing algorithms to throttle tunnel participation based on
actual bandwidth usage, along side peer profiling updates to select
peers better through a wider sample of data.  This has done pretty
well at both choking tunnel participation when necessary and finding
good peers when possible.
Another major update in that release was a change to how we verify
time synchronization - rather than just checking the time sync once
during connection establishment, peers now periodically send
messages to each other with their current time, and if the time
received is too far skewed, the connection is dropped.  This has
helped kick a few routers who were skewing off the net until they
recovered (which is good), and the vast majority of peers have been
quite close to 'correct' (you can see the clock skew on the
With that, the network has been performing pretty well, but we were
still seeing the occational bulk disconnect.  After some debugging
we tracked down an unintentional and wholely unnecessary DNS lookup
that occurred whenever a router sent a message to a peer who has a
hostname specified.  This not only wasted time, but it wasted time
within the jobqueue - essentially injecting a whole lot of lag for
no reason.  With that lookup removed, the router handled much
better under heavily congested situations, but we were still seeing
those occational bulk disconnects.  After digging around in the
stats and logging, we came up with a plausible theory that explains
why those disconnects have been occurring - blaming them almost
entirely on those DNS lookups.  To test that theory (and to deploy
some other goodies), we pushed out the 0.4.2.5 release this
We'll see how it goes.
* 2) 0.5 strategy
As the roadmap [1] says, the next planned release is 0.5, including
a revised tunnel pool and encryption/id technique.  Avoiding a
big explanation (see [2], [3], [4], and a tiny bit of [5]), we will
do this in two stages - first revamp the tunnel pooling and
push that out as an interim release, debugging what is necessary,
then revamp the encryption/id stuff, pushing that out as 0.5.  Oh,
and of course, once the algorithms for the pooling and encryption
updates are in pretty good shape, they'll be posted up here and on
the website for review.
Along the way though, there will probably be small bugfix releases
unrelated to the 0.5 stuff, but I don't have any specifically

* 1) Net status
Pretty much as before - a steady number of peers, eepsites fairly
reachable, and irc for hours on end.  You can get a peek at the
reachability of various eepsites through a few different pages:
 -  -  - * 2) Core updates
For those hanging out in the channel (or reading the CVS logs),
you've seen a lot of things going on, even though its been a while
since the last release.  A full list of changes since the 0.4.1.3
release can be found online [1], but there are two major
modifications, one good and one bad:
The good one is that we've dramatically cut down on the memory churn
caused by all sorts of insane temporary object creation.  I finally
got fed up with watching the GC go mad while debugging the new
streaming lib, so after a few days of profiling, tweaking, and
tuning, the ugliest parts are cleaned up.
The bad one is a bugfix for how some tunnel routed messages are
handled - there were some situations where a message was sent
directly to the targeted router rather than tunnel routed prior to
delivery, which could be exploited by an adversary who can do a
little coding.  We now properly tunnel route when in doubt.
That may sound good, but the 'bad' part is that it means that there's
going to be some increased latency due to the additional hops, though
these are hops that needed to be used anyway.
There are other debugging activities going on in the core as well, so
there hasn't been an official release yet - CVS HEAD is 0.4.1.3-8.
In the next few days we'll probably have a 0.4.1.4 release, just to
get all that stuff cleared up.  It won't contain the new streaming
lib, of course.
[1] * 3) Streaming lib
Speaking of the streaming lib, there has been a lot of progress here,
and the side by side comparison of the old and new libs are looking
good.  However, there is still work to be done, and as I said last
time, we're not going to rush it out the door.  That does mean that
the roadmap has slipped, likely in the range of 2-3 weeks.  More
details when they're available.
* 4) mail.i2p progress
Lots of new stuff this week - working in and out proxies!  See
 for more information.
* 5) BT progress
There has been a flurry of activity regarding porting a BitTorrent
client as of late, as well as updating some tracker settings.
Perhaps we can get some updates from those involved during the

1) Congestion

4) ???
* 1) Congestion
I know, I'm breaking the habit of naming point 1 "Net status", but
this week "congestion" seems appropriate.  The network itself has
been doing pretty well, but as the bittorrent usage increased, things
started getting more and more clogged up, leading to an essential
congestion collapse [1].
This was expected, and only reinforces our plan - get the new
streaming lib out there, and revamp our tunnel management so we have
sufficient data about peers to use when our fast peers fail.  There
were some other factors in play in the recent network problems, but
the bulk can be traced to the congestion increase and resulting
tunnel failures (which in turn caused all sorts of wild peer
[1] * 2) Streaming
There has been a lot of progress with the streaming lib, and I've got
a squid proxy rigged up to it through the live net that I've been
using it frequently for my normal web browsing.  With mule's help,
we've been hammering the streams pretty hard too by piping frost and
FUQID through the network (my god, I never realized how abusive frost
was before doing this!)  A few significant longstanding bugs have
been tracked down this way, and some tweaks to help control massive
numbers of connections have been added.
Bulk streams are working great too, with both slow start and
congestion avoidance, and the quick send/reply connections (ala HTTP
get+response) are doing exactly what they should.
I expect we'll draft some volunteers to try deploying it further over
the next few days, and hopefully get us to the 0.4.2 level soon.  I
don't want to say it'll be so good that it does your dishes, and I'm
sure there'll be bugs that slip through, but it does look promising.
* 3) BT
Barring the recent network troubles, the i2p-bt port has been making
leaps and bounds.  I know a few people have pulled down over a GB of
data through it, and performance has been as expected (due to the old
streaming lib, ~4KBps per peer in the swarm).  I try to listen in on
the work being discussed in the  channel - perhaps duck could
give us a summary in the meeting?

Hi gang,
Its been a long 2 months since the 0.4.1 release, but we've finally
got the new 0.4.2 release out and ready for your consumption.  As
discussed in the meeting logs and weekly status notes, the main
change is a new streaming library which will improve reliability,
reduce latency, and get more appropriate throughput.  The new release
is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE, so you MUST UPGRADE.
The update process is largely as before - though there is one
important change, so please, read the instructions for updating on
The installer has also been changed a bit, streamlining some things,
and on windows systems, we build shortcuts on in the start menu and
on the desktop (if desired).
There have also been numerous bugfixes and improvements along the
way - please see the full list online for details:
Anyway, thats that - please update as soon as possible, because if
you don't, you wont be able to do anything on I2P at all - it is NOT
BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE (should I repeat that a third time?  maybe with
blink tags?)  If anyone has any problems, please post up on the
list [1], the forum [2], or get on  [3]!

5) ???
* 1) 0.4.2 and 0.4.2.1
Since we finally pushed out 0.4.2, the network's reliability and
throughput shot up for a while, until we ran into the brand new
bugs we created.  IRC connections for most people are lasting
for hours on end, though for some who have run into some of the
problems, its been a bumpy ride.  There have been a slew of
fixes [1] though, and later on tonight or early tomorrow we'll
have a new 0.4.2.1 release ready for download.
[1] * 2) mail.i2p
Earlier today I got slipped a note from postman saying he had
some things he wanted to discuss - for more info, see the
meeting logs (or if you're reading this before the meeting,
swing on by).
* 3) i2p-bt
One of the downsides of the new release is that we're running into
some trouble with the i2p-bt port.  Some of the problems have been
identified found and fixed in the streaming lib, but further work
is necessary to get it where we need it to be.
* 4) eepsites
There has been some discussion over the months on the list, in the
channel, and on the forum about some problems with how eepsites
and the eepproxy work - recently some have mentioned problems with
how and what headers are filtered, others have brought up the
dangers of poorly configured browsers, and there's also DrWoo's
page [2] summarizing many of the risks.  One particularly note
worthy event is the fact that some people are actively working on
applets that will hijack the user's computer if they do not
disable applets.  (SO DISABLE JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT IN YOUR BROWSER)
This, of course, leads to a discussion of how we can secure
things.  I've heard suggestions of building our own browser or
bundling one with preconfigured secure settings, but lets be
realistic - thats a lot more work than anyone here is going to
bite into.  However, there are three other camps:
1) Use a fascist HTML filter and tie it in with the proxy
2) Use a fascist HTML filter as part of a script that fetches
   pages for you
3) Use a secure macro language
The first is pretty much like we have now, except we filter the
content rendered through something like muffin or freenet's
anonymity filter.  The downside here is that it still exposes
HTTP headers so we'd have to anonymize the HTTP side as well.
The second is much like you can see on  with the
CGIproxy, or alternately as you can see in freenet's fproxy.  This
takes care of the HTTP side as well.
The third has its benefits and drawbacks - it lets us use much
more compelling interfaces (as we can safely use some known safe
javascript, etc), but has the downside of backwards
incompatability.  Perhaps a merge of this with a filter, allowing
you to embed the macros in filtered html?
Anyway, this is an important development effort and addresses one
of the most compelling uses of I2P - safe and anonymous
interactive websites.  Perhaps someone has some other ideas or
info as to how we could get what is needed?

Ok, I'm running late for the meeting, so I suppose I should sign

Hi everyone,
We've got a new 0.4.1.2 release out and about with a bunch of
bugfixes, tools to help monitor the health of your node, reduce
memory churn, and help cut down on the per-hop message processing
time.  I don't expect any sort of revolutionary performance
improvements with this, but I do hope it'll make the latency a bit
smoother.  Upgrading is highly recommended.
The full list of whats been added since 0.4.1.1 is up and available
at Its all backwards compatible, and duck has been helping me test out
these updates as they've been made (as well as gather truckloads of
stats to help identify the bottlenecks on his fairly active router).

Hi y'all, its that time of the week again
* Index:
1) 0.4.0.1
2) Threat model updates
3) Website updates
4) Roadmap
5) Client apps
6) ???
* 1) 0.4.0.1
Since last Wednesday's 0.4.0.1 release, things have been going
pretty well on the net - more than 2/3rd of the network has
upgraded, and we'e been maintaining between 60 and 80 routers on
the network.  IRC connection times vary, but lately 4-12 hour
connections have been normal.  There have been some reports of
funkiness starting up on OS/X though, but I believe some
progress is being made on that front too.
* 2) Threat model updates
As mentioned in reply [1] to Toni's post [2], there has been a
pretty substantial rewrite of the threat model [3].  The main
difference is that rather than the old way of addressing the
threats in an ad-hoc manner, I tried to follow some of the
taxonomies offered within the literature [4].  The biggest
problem for me was finding ways to fit the actual techniques
people can use into the patterns offered - often a single
attack fit within several different categories.  As such, I'm
not really too pleased with how the information in that page
is conveyed, but its better than it was before.
[1] [2] [3] [4] * 3) Website updates
Thanks to Curiosity's help, we've begun on some updates to the
website - the most visible of which you can see on the homepage
itself.  This should help people out who stumble upon I2P and
want to know right off the bat wtf this I2P thing is, rather
than having to hunt and peck through the various pages.  In any
case, progress, ever onwards :)
* 4) Roadmap
Speaking of progress, I've finally thrown together a revamped
roadmap [5] based upon what I feel we need to implement and upon
what must be accomplished to provide for the user's needs.  The
major changes to the old roadmap are:
 * Drop AMOC altogether, replaced with UDP (however, we'll support
   TCP for those who can't use UDP *cough*mihi*cough*)
 * Kept all of the restricted route operation to the 2.0 release,
   rather than bring in partial restricted routes earlier.  I
   believe we'll be able to meet the needs of many users without
   restricted routes, though of course with them many more users
   will be able to join us.  Walk before run, as they say.
 * Pulled the streaming lib in to the 0.4.3 release, as we don't
   want to go 1.0 with the ~4KBps per stream limit.  The bounty on
   this is still of course valid, but if no one claims it before
   0.4.2 is done, I'll start working on it.
 * TCP revamp moved to 0.4.1 to address some of our uglier issues
   (high CPU usage when connecting to people, the whole mess with
   "target changed identities", adding autodetection of IP address)
The other items scheduled for various 0.4.* releases have already
been implemented.  However, there is one other thing dropped from
the roadmap...
[5] * 5) Client apps
We need client applications.  Applications that are engaging,
secure, scalable, and anonymous.  I2P by itself doesn't do much,
it merely lets two endpoints talk to each other anonymously.
While I2PTunnel does offer one hell of a swiss army knife, tools
like that are only really engaging to the geeks among us.  We need
more than that - we need something that lets people do what they
actually want to do, and that helps them do it better.  We need a
reason for people to use I2P beyond simply because its safer.
So far I've been touting MyI2P to meet that need - a distributed
blogging system offering a LiveJournal-esque interface.  I
recently [6] discussed some of the functionality within MyI2P on
the list.  However, I've pulled it out of the roadmap as its just
too much work for me to do and still give the base I2P network the
attention it needs (we're already packed extremely tight [7]).
There are a few other apps that have much promise.  Stasher [8]
would provide a significant infrastructure for distributed data
storage, but I'm not sure how that's progressing.  Even with
Stasher, however, there would need to be an engaging user
interface (though some FCP apps may be able to work with it).
IRC is also a potent system, though has its limitations due to
the server-based architecture.  oOo has done some work to see
about implementing transparent DCC though, so perhaps the IRC
side could be used for public chat and DCC for private file
transfers or serverless chat.
General eepsite functionality is also important, and what we
have now is completely unsatisfactory.  As DrWoo points out [9],
there are significant anonymity risks with the current setup,
and even though oOo has made some patches filtering some
headers, there is much more work to be done before eepsites can
be considered secure.  There are a few different approaches to
addressing this, all of which can work, but all of which
require work.  I do know that duck mentioned he had someone
working on something, though I don't know how thats coming or
whether it could be bundled in with I2P for everyone to use
or not.  Duck?
Another pair of client apps that could help would be either a
swarming file transfer app (ala BitTorrent) or a more
traditional file sharing app (ala DC/Napster/Gnutella/etc).
This is what I suspect a large number of people want, but there
are issues with each of these systems.  However, they're well
known and porting may not be much trouble (perhaps).
Ok, so the above isn't anything new - why did I bring them all
up?  Well, we need to find a way to get an engaging, secure,
scalable, and anonymous client application implemented, and it
isn't going to happen all by itself out of the blue.  I've come
to accept that I'm not going to be able to do it myself, so we
need to be proactive and find a way to get it done.
To do so, I think our bounty system may be able to help, but I
think one of the reasons we haven't seen much activity on that
front (people working on implementing a bounty) is because
they're spread too thin.  To get the results we need, I feel we
need to prioritize what we want and focus our efforts on that
top item, 'sweetening the pot' so as to hopefully encourage
someone to step up and work on the bounty.
My personal opinion is still that a secure and distributed
blogging system like MyI2P would be best.  Rather than simply
shoveling data back and forth anonymously, it offers a way to
build communities, the lifeblood of any development effort.  In
addition, it offers a relatively high signal to noise ratio,
low chance for abuse of the commons, and in general, a light
network load.  It doesn't, however, offer the full richness of
normal websites, but the 1.8 million active LiveJournal users
don't seem to mind.
Beyond that, securing the eepsite architecture would be my
next preference, allowing browsers the safety they need and
letting people serve eepsites 'out of the box'.
File transfer and distributed data storage are also incredibly
powerful, but they don't seem to be as community oriented as
we probably want for the first normal end user app.
I want all of the apps listed to be implemented yesterday, as
well as a thousand other apps I couldn't begin to dream of.  I
also want world peace, and end to hunger, the destruction of
capitalism, freedom from statism, racism, sexism, homophibia,
an end to the outright destruction of the environment and all
that other evil stuff.  However, we are only so many people
and we can only accomplish so much.  As such, we must
prioritize and focus our efforts on achieving what we can
rather than sit around overwhelmed with all we want to do.
Perhaps we can discuss some ideas about what we should do in
the meeting tonight.

4) ???
* 1) 0.5.0.5
Last week's 0.5.0.5 release has had its ups and downs - the major
change to address some attacks in the netDb seems to work as
expected, but has exposed some long overlooked bugs in the netDb's
operation.  This has caused some substantial reliability issues,
especially for eepsites.  The bugs have however been identified and
addressed in CVS, and those fixes among a few others will be pushed
out as a 0.5.0.6 release within the next day.
* 2) Bayesian peer profiling
bla has been doing some research into improving our peer profiling
by exploiting simple bayesian filtering from the gathered stats [1].
It looks quite promising, though I'm not sure where it stands at the
moment - perhaps we can get an update from bla during the meeting?
[1]     * 3) Q
There is lots of progress going on with aum's Q app, both in the
core functionality and with a few people building various xmlrpc
frontends.  Rumor has it we might be seeing another Q build out this
weekend with a whole slew of goodies described on * 4) ???
Ok, yeah, very brief status notes, as I got the timezones mixed up
*again* (actually, I got the days mixed up too, thought it was
Monday until a few hours ago).  Anyway, there is lots of stuff going
on not mentioned above, so swing on by the meeting and see whats up!

1) Net status
2) SSU status
3) Bayesian peer profiling
4) Q status
5) ???
* 1) Net status
Last week's 0.5.0.6 release seems to have fixed the netDb issues we
were seeing (yay).  Sites and services are much more reliable than
they were on 0.5.0.5, though there have been some reports of trouble
where a site or service would become unreachable after a few days
* 2) SSU status
There's been lots of progress on the 0.6 UDP code, with the first
batch of commits already made to CVS.  Its not anything you could
actually use yet, but the fundamentals are in place.  Session
negotiation works well and the semireliable message delivery
performs as expected.  There's still a lot of work to do though,
test cases to write, and oddball situations to debug, but its
If things go well, we may have some alpha testing next week, just
for people who can explicitly configure their firewalls/NATs.  I'd
like to get the general operation hammered out first before adding
in the relay handler, tuning up the netDb for faster routerInfo
expiration, and selecting relays to publish.  I'm also going to take
this opportunity to do a whole slew of testing, as there are several
critical queueing factors being addressed.
* 3) Bayesian peer profiling
bla has been churning away at some revisions to how we decide what
peers to tunnel through, and though bla couldn't make it to the
meeting, there's some interesting data to report:
<+bla> I've performed direct node speed measurements: I've profiled
       some 150 nodes by using OB tunnels of length 0, IB tunnels of
       length 1, batching-interval = 0ms
<+bla> In addition, I've just done some _very_ basic and
       _preliminary_ speed estimation using naive Bayesian
       classification
<+bla> The latter was done using the default expl. tunnel lengths
<+bla> The intersection between the set of nodes on which I have
       "ground truth", and the set of nodes in the current
       measurements, is 117 nodes
<+bla> Results are not _that_ bad, but not too impressive either
<+bla> See <+bla> Basic very-slow/fast separation is ok-ish, but fine-grained
       separation among the faster peers could be much better
<+jrandom2p> hmm, how'd the actual values get calculated - is that
             full RTT or is it RTT/length ?
<+bla> Using the normal expl. tunnels, it's next to impossible to
       prevent batching delays.
<+bla> The actual values are the ground-truth values: those obtained
       using OB=0 and IB=1
<+bla> (and variance=0, and no batching delay)
<+jrandom2p> the results look pretty good from here though
<+bla> The estimated timings are those obtained using Bayesian
       inference from _actual_ expl. tunnels of length 2 +/- 1
<+bla> This is obtained from 3000 RTTs, recorded over a period of
       about 3 hours (that's long)
<+bla> It does assume (for the moment) that peer speed is static.
       I've yet to implement weighting
<+jrandom2p> sounds kickass.  nice work bla
<+jrandom2p> hmm, so the estimate should equal 1/4 actual
<+bla> jrandom: No: All measured RTTs (using the normal expl.
       tunnels), are corrected for the number of hops in the
       round-trip
<+jrandom2p> ah ok
<+bla> Only after that, the Bayesian classifier is trained
<+bla> For now, I bin the measured times-per-hop into 10 classes:
       50, 100, ..., 450 ms, and an additional class >500 ms
<+bla> E.g., small delays-per-hop could be weighted using a larger
       factor, as could complete failures (>60000 ms).
<+bla> Though.... 65% of the estimated timings, fall within 0.5
       standard deviations from the actual node time
<+bla> However, this has to be redone, since the standard deviation
       is influenced heavily by the >60000 ms failures
After further discussion, bla pulled up a comparison against the
existing speed calculator, posted @ Mirrors of those pngs are up at
 and
(for terminology, IB=inbound tunnel hops, OB=outbound tunnel hops,
and after some clarification, the "ground truth" measurements were
obtained by 1 hop outbound and 0 hop inbound, not the other way
* 4) Q status
Aum has been making lots of headway on Q as well, most recently
working on a web based client interface.  The next Q build will not
be backwards compatible, as it includes a whole slew of new
features, but I'm sure we'll hear more info from Aum when there's
more info to be heard :)
* 5) ???
Thats about it for the moment (gotta wrap this up before meeting
time).  Oh, as an aside, it looks like I'll be moving earlier than
planned, so perhaps some of the dates in the roadmap might shift
around while I'm in transit to wherever I end up.  Anyway, swing
on by the channel in a few minutes to harass us with new ideas!

2) nntp
3) tech proposals
4) ???
* 1) 0.5 status
There has been lots of progress on the 0.5 front, with a big batch
of commits yesterday.  The bulk of the router now uses the new
tunnel encryption and tunnel pooling [1], and it has been working
well on the test network.  There are still some key pieces left to
integrate, and the code is obviously not backwards compatible, but
I'm hoping we can do some wider scale deployment sometime next week.
As mentioned before, the initial 0.5 release will provide the
foundation on which different tunnel peer selection/ordering
strategies can operate.  We'll start with a basic set of
configurable parameters for the exploratory and client pools, but
later releases will probably include other options for different
user profiles.
* 2) nntp
As mentioned on LazyGuy's site [2] and my blog [3], we've got a new
NNTP server up and running on the network, reachable at nntp.fr.i2p.
While LazyGuy has fired up some suck [4] scripts to read in a few
lists from gmane, the content is pretty much of, for, and by I2P
users.  jdot, LazyGuy, and myself did some research into what
newsreaders could be used safely, and there seem to be some pretty
easy solutions.  See my blog for instructions on running slrn [5]
to do anonymous newsreading and posting.
[2] [3] [4] [5] * 3) tech proposals
Orion and others have put up a series of RFCs for various tech
issues up on ugha's wiki [6] to help flesh out some of the harder
client and app level problems out there.  Please use that as the
place to discuss naming issues, updates to SAM, swarming ideas, and
the like - when you post up there, we can all collaborate at our own
place to get a better result.
[6] * 4) ???
Thats all I have for the moment (good thing too, as the meeting
starts momentarily).  As always, post up your thoughts whenever and
wherever :)

Hi y'all, update time again
* Index

2) 0.5
3) i2p-bt 0.1.6
4) fortuna
5) ???
* 1) 0.4.2.6-*
It doesn't seem like it, but its been over a month since the 0.4.2.6
release came out and things are still in pretty good shape.  There
have been a series of pretty useful updates [1] since then, but no
real show stopper calling for a new release to get pushed.  However,
in the last day or two we've had some really good bugfixes sent in
(thanks anon and Sugadude!), and if we weren't on the verge of the
0.5 release, I'd probably package 'er up and push 'er out.  anon's
update fixes a border condition in the streaming lib which has been
causing many of the timeouts seen in BT and other large transfers,
so if you're feeling adventurous, grab CVS HEAD and try 'er out.  Or
wait around for the next release, of course.
[1] * 2) 0.5
Lots and lots of progress on the 0.5 front (as anyone on the i2p-cvs
list [2] can attest to).  All of the tunnel updates and various
performance tweaks have been tested out, and while it doesn't
include much in the way of the various [3] enforced ordering
algorithms, it does get the basics covered.  We've also integrated
a set of (BSD licensed) Bloom filters [4] from XLattice [5],
allowing us to detect replay attacks without requiring any
per-message memory usage and nearly 0ms overhead.  To accomodate our
needs, the filters have been trivially extended to decay so that
after a tunnel expires, the filter doesn't have the IVs we saw in
that tunnel anymore.
While I'm trying to slip in as much as I can into the 0.5 release, I
also realize that we need to expect the unexpected - meaning the
best way to improve it is to get it into your hands and learn from
how it works (and doesn't work) for you.  To help with this, as I've
mentioned before, we're going to have a 0.5 release (hopefully out in
the next week), breaking backwards compatability, then work on
improving it from there, building a 0.5.1 release when its ready.
Looking back at the roadmap [6], the only thing being deferred to
0.5.1 is the strict ordering.  There'll also be improvements to the
throttling and load balancing over time, I'm sure, but I expect
we'll be tweaking that pretty much forever.  There have been some
other things discussed that I've hoped to include in 0.5 though,
like the download tool and the one-click update code, but it looks
like those will be deferred as well.
[2] [3]                     tunnel-alt.html?rev=HEAD
[4] [5] [6] * 3) i2p-bt 0.1.6
duck has patched up a new i2p-bt release (yay!), available at the
usual locations, so get yours while its hot [7].  Between this
update and anon's streaming lib patch, I pretty much saturated my
uplink while seeding some files, so give it a shot.
[7] * 4) fortuna
As mentioned in last week's meeting, smeghead has been churning away
at a whole slew of different updates lately, and while battling to
get I2P working with gcj, some really horrendous PRNG issues have
cropped up in some JVMs, pretty much forcing the issue of having a
PRNG we can count on.  Having heard back from the GNU-Crypto folks,
while their fortuna implementation hasn't really been deployed yet,
it looks to be the best fit for our needs.  We might be able to get
it into the 0.5 release, but chances are it'll get deferred to 0.5.1
though, as we'll want to tweak it so that it can provide us with the
necessary quantity of random data.
* 5) ???
Lots of things going on, and there has been a burst of activity on
the forum [8] lately as well, so I'm sure I've missed some things.
In any case, swing on by the meeting in a few minutes and say whats
on your mind (or just lurk and throw in the random snark)

1) Net status
2) 0.5 status
3) i2p-bt 0.1.7
4) ???
* 1) Net status
While no new bugs have shown up in the network, last week we gained
some exposure on a popular French p2p website, which has led to an
increase both in users and in bittorrent activity.  At the peak, we
reached 211 routers on the net, though its hovering between 150 and
180 lately.  Reported bandwidth usage has been up as well, though
unfortunately the irc reliability has been degraded, with one of the
servers lowering their bandwidth limits due to the load.  There have
been a bunch of improvements to the streaming lib to help with this,
but they've been on the 0.5-pre branch, so not yet available to the
live net.
Another transient problem has been the outage of one of the HTTP
outproxies (www1.squid.i2p), causing 50% of outproxy requests to
fail.  You can temporarily remove that outproxy by opening up your
I2PTunnel config [1], editing the eepProxy, and changing the
"Outproxies:" line to contain only "squid.i2p".  Hopefully we'll
get that other one back online soon to increase redundancy.
[1] * 2) 0.5 status
There has been lots of progress this past week on 0.5 (I bet you're
tired of hearing that, 'eh?).  Thanks to the help of postman,
cervantes, duck, spaetz, and some unnamed person, we've been running
a test network with the new code for nearly a week and have worked
through a good number of bugs that I hadn't seen in my local test
For the past day or so now, the changes have been minor, and I don't
forsee any substantial code left before the 0.5 release goes out.
There is some additional cleaning, documentation, and assembly left,
and it doesn't hurt to let the 0.5 test network churn through in
case additional bugs are exposed over time.  Since this is going to
be a BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE RELEASE, to give you time to plan for
updating, I'll fix a simple deadline of THIS FRIDAY as when 0.5
will be released.
As bla mentioned on irc, eepsite hosts may want to take their site
down on Thursday or Friday and keep them down until Saturday when
many users will have upgraded.  This will help reduce the effect of
an intersection attack (e.g. if 90% of the network has migrated to
0.5 and you're still on 0.4, if someone reaches your eepsite, they
know you're one of the 10% of routers left on the network).
I could start to get into whats been updated in 0.5, but I'd end up
going on for pages and pages, so perhaps I should just hold off and
put that into the documentation which I should write up :)
* 3) i2p-bt 0.1.7
duck has put together a bugfix release to last week's 0.1.6 update,
and word on the street says its kickass (perhaps /too/ kickass,
given the increased network usage ;)  More info up @ the i2p-bt
forum [2]
[2] * 4) ???
Lots of other things going on in the IRC discussions and on the
forum [3], too much to briefly summarize.  Perhaps the interested
parties can swing by the meeting and give us updates and thoughts?

Hash: SHA1
Hi y'all,
After 6 months of work on the 0.4 series, we've implemented and
deployed the new streaming library, integrated and tested bittorrent,
mail, and naming apps, fixed a bunch of bugs, and learned as much as
we could from real world users.  We now have a new 0.5 release which
reworks the tunnel routing algorithms, improving security and
anonymity while giving the user more control of their own
performance related tradeoffs.  In addition, we've bundled susi23's
susimail client, upgraded to the latest Jetty (allowing both symlinks
and CGI), and a whole lot more.  This new release is not backwards
compatible - you must upgrade to get anything useful done.
There has been a lot of work going on since 0.4.2.6 a month and a
half ago, with contributions by smeghead, duck, Jhor, cervantes,
Ragnarok, Sugadude, and the rest of the rabid testers in  and
  I could write for pages describing whats up, but instead
I'll just direct you to the change log at
For the impatient, please review the install and update instructions
up at Please note that since this new release updates the classpath, the
update process will require you to start up the router again after
it finishes.  Any local modifications to the wrapper.config will
be lost when updating, so please be sure to back it up.  In
addition, even though this new release includes the latest Jetty
(5.1.2), if you want to enable CGI support, you will need to edit
your ./eepsite/jetty.xml to include:
Common Gateway Interface
adjusting the Path as necessary for your OS/distro/tastes.  New
users have it easy - all of this is done for them.
While the docs on the website haven't been updated to reflect the new
tunnel routing and crypto changes yet, the nitty gritty is up at
There will be another release in the 0.5 series beyond this one,
including more options for allowing the user to control the impact
of predecessor attacks on their anonymity.  There will certainly be
performance and load balancing improvements as well, using the
feedback we get deploying the new tunnel code on a wider network.
Until the UDP transport is added in 0.6, we will want to continue to
be fairly low key, as we've already run into the default limits on
some braindead OSes (*cough*98*cough*).  There is much we can improve
upon while the network is small though, and while I know we all want
to go out and show the world what I2P can do, another two months
waiting won't hurt.
Anyway, thats that.  The new net is up and running, squid.i2p and
other services should be up, you know where to get the goods, so
get goin'!

Hi y'all, time for our first weekly status notes of 2005
* Index
1) Net status
2) 0.4.2.6
3) 0.5
4) jabber @ chat.i2p
5) ???
* 1) Net status
Over the last week, things have been pretty interesting on the net -
on nye, there were some comments posted to a popular website talking
about i2p-bt and we've had a small burst of new users.  At the
moment there are between 120-150 routers on the net, though that
peaked at 160 a few days ago.  The network held its own though, with
high capacity peers picking up the excess load without much
disruption to other peers.  Some users running without bandwidth
limits on really fast links have reported throughput of 2-300KBps,
while those with less capacity use the usual low 1-5KBps.
I think I remember Connelly mentioning that he was seeing 300+
different routers over the course of a few days after new years, so
there has been significant churn.  On the other hand, we now have a
steady 120-150 users online, unlike the previous 80-90, which is a
reasonable increase.  We still do *not* want it to grow too much
yet though, as there are known implementation issues that still need
to be done.  Specifically, until the 0.6 release [1], we're going to
want to stay below 2-300 peers to keep the number of threads at a
reasonable level.  However, if someone wants to help out
implementing the UDP transport, we can get there much faster.
In the last week, I've watched the stats put out by the i2p-bt
trackers and there have been gigs of large files transferred, with
some reports of 80-120KBps.  IRC has had more bumps than usual
since those comments were posted on that website, but its still on
the order of hours between disconnect.  (from what I can tell, the
router that irc.duck.i2p is on has been running pretty close to its
bandwidth limit, which would explain things)
[1] * 2) 0.4.2.6
There have been some fixes and new features added to CVS since the
0.4.2.5 release that we're going to want to roll out soon,
including reliability fixes for the streaming lib, improved
resiliance to IP address change, and the bundling of ragnarok's
addressbook implementation.
If you haven't heard of the addressbook or haven't used it, the
short story is that it will magically update your hosts.txt file
by periodically fetching and merging changes from some anonymously
hosted locations (default being  and
  You won't need to change any files,
touch any configuration, or run any extra applications - it'll be
deployed inside the I2P router as a standard .war file.
Of course, if you *do* want to get down and dirty with the
addressbook, you are more than welcome to - see Ragnarok's site [2]
for the details.  People who already have the addressbook deployed
in their router will need to do a little tap dancing during the
0.4.2.6 upgrade, but it'll work with all your old config settings.
[2] * 3) 0.5
Numbers, numbers, numbers!  Well, as I've said before, the 0.5
release will be revamping how the tunnel routing works, and progress
is being made on that front.  For the last few days I've been
implementing the new encryption code (and unit tests), and once
they're working I'll post up a doc describing my current thoughts on
how, what, and why the new tunnel routing will operate.  I'm getting
the encryption implemented for it now instead of later so that
people can review what it means in a concrete sense, as well as find
problems areas and suggestions for improvement.  I'm hoping to have
the code working by the end of the week, so maybe there'll be more
docs posted this weekend.  No promises though.
* 4) jabber @ chat.i2p
jdot has started up a new jabber server, and it seems to work pretty
well for both one on one conversations and group chat.  check out
the info on the forum [3].  the i2p dev discussion channel will
still be the irc  but its always nice to have alternatives.

Ok, thats about all I have to mention at the moment - I'm sure
there's lots more going on that other people want to bring up
though, so swing on by the meeting in 15m @ the usual place [4] and

@_subject: [i2p] 0.4.2.6 is available 
Hash: SHA1
Hi y'all, time for a new update
The 0.4.2.6 release has a whole slew of bug fixes, reliability
improvements, and bundles Ragnarok's addressbook as a client
application.  The release is backwards compatible and should not
be too disruptive, so upgrade when you get the chance.
As mentioned in the weekly status notes [1], the addressbook
essentially just automates the anonymous fetching and merging of
hosts.txt files from locations of your choosing (defaults being
 and   More
details can be found on Ragnarok's site [2], and the source is in
cvs [3].
If you don't have the addressbook installed already, you have no
additional work to do.  However, if you previously installed the
addressbook and manually wired it to run in your router (through
the lines in clients.config and a reference to the .jar file in
wrapper.config), you will need to remove those.  Existing
addressbook configuration and data files will be honored if they
are located in the default addressbook/ directory.
[1] [2] [3] Anyway, thats that.  The full list of updates in the release can
be found in the usual place [4], and upgrading uses the same process
as before [5].

7) ???
* 1) Net status
Overall the net is handling itself well, though we had some problems
with one of the irc servers being offline and my outproxy acting up.
However, the other irc server was (and still is) around (though at
the moment doesn't have CTCP disabled - see [1]), so we were able to
satiate our need for irc :)
[1] * 2) 0.5 progress
There's progress, ever onwards!  Ok, I suppose I should get into a
little more detail than that.  I've finally got the new tunnel
routing crypto implemented and tested (yay!), but during some
discussions we found a place where there could be one level of
anonymity leak, so its being revised (the first hop would have
known they were the first hop, which is Bad.  but really really
easy to fix).  Anyway, I hope to get the docs and code on that
updated and posted soon, and docs on the rest of the 0.5 tunnel
operation / pooling / etc posted later.  More news when there's
more news.
* 3) 0.6 status
Mule has begun investigations into the UDP transport, and we've
been mining zab for his experiences with limewire's UDP code.
Its all very promising, but much work to be done (and still
several months out on the roadmap [2]).  Got some inspiration or
suggestions?  Get involved and help focus it towards what needs to
be done!
[2] * 4) azneti2p
I almost wet my pants when I got the info, but it looks like the
folks at azureus have written up an I2P plugin, allowing both
anonymous tracker usage and anonymous data comm!  Multiple
torrents work within a single I2P destination too, and it uses
the I2PSocket directly, allowing tight integration with the
streaming lib.  The azneti2p plugin is still in the early stages
with this 0.1 release, and there are lots of optimizations and ease
of use improvements coming down the pipe, but if you're up for
getting your hands dirty, swing by i2p-bt on the i2p irc networks
and get in on the fun :)
For the adventurus types, get the latest azureus [3], check their
i2p howto [4], and snag the plugin [5].
[3] [4] [5] duck has been taking heroic measures to keep compatability with
i2p-bt, and there is frantic hacking in  as I type this, so
keep an eye out for a new i2p-bt release Real Soon Now.
* 5) fbsd
Thanks to the work of lioux, there's now a freebsd ports entry for
i2p [6].  While we aren't really looking to have lots of
distro-specific installs out there, he promises to keep it updated
when we give sufficient notice for new release.  This should be
helpful for fbsd-current folks - thanks lioux!
[6] * 6) hosts.txt as WoT
Now that the 0.4.2.6 release has bundled in Ragnarok's addressbook,
the process of keeping your hosts.txt populated with new entries is
in every user's control.  Not only that, but you can view the
addressbook subscriptions as a poor-man's web of trust - you import
new entries from a site you trust to introduce you to new
destinations (defaults being dev.i2p and duck.i2p).
With this capacity comes a whole new dimension - the ability for
people to choose what sites to essentially link to in their
hosts.txt and which ones not to.  While there is a place for the
public free-for-all that has occurred in the past, now that the
naming system is not just in theory but in practice fully
distributed, people will need to figure out their own policies on
publishing other people's destinations.
The important part behind the scenes here is that this is a learning
opportunity for the I2P community.  Before, both gott and I were
trying to help push the naming issue by publishing gott's site as
jrandom.i2p (he asked for that site first - I did not, and have no
control whatsoever as to the contents of that URL).  Now we may
begin to explore how we are going to deal with sites not listed in
the  or on forum.i2p.  Not being
posted on those locations doesn't prevent in any way a site from
operating - your hosts.txt is just your local address book.
Anyway, enough babbling, I just wanted to put people on notice so
we can all see what is to be done.
* 7) ???
Yowza, thats a lot of stuff.  Busy week, and I don't forsee things
slowing down anytime soon.  So, swing on by the meeting in a few
minutes and we can talk about stuff.

@_subject: [i2p] Tunnel cryptography for I2P 0.5 (corrected typo) 
Hash: SHA1
Thanks Connelly for the writeup and the discussion,
A few key changes were missed in this draft, and I've incorporated
all of the suggestions from yesterday into [1].  The explanation of
the overall rationale for the two different strategies is largely
correct.  This is still a work in progress, and will be improved as
we get both more feedback and clarify some issues.
An implementation of the crypto for first strategy [2] has been
created [3], but as there are some weaknesses in inbound tunnels
when dealing with colluding attackers who also control the gateway,
the second strategy seems more appealing.  Next up I'd like to get
that implemented into code so that any further issues can be fleshed
out, as well as to make concrete what it is that is being specified.
Of course, none of those html docs are a finished spec for I2P
overall as they assume familiarity with the other non-tunnel-related
parts of I2P and do not include the relevent references to where we
snagged our ideas ;)  This is just a state-of-the-design view into
the 0.5 tunnel revamp.
Anyway, thanks again for the updates Connelly, and if anyone is
looking for the details currently planned for, please see [1].
Suggestions/comments/criticisms always welcome, or if you want to
get involved, please get in touch!  We're in  on irc.freenode.net

* 1) Net status
Hmm, not much to report here - things still work as they did last
week, size of the net is still pretty similar, perhaps a little
larger.  Some neat new sites are popping up - see the forum [1]
and orion [2] for details.
* 2) 0.5
Thanks to the help of postman, dox, frosk, and cervantes (and
everyone who tunneled data through their routers ;), we've
collected a full day's worth of message size stats [3].  There are
two sets of stats there - height and width of the zoom.  This was
driven by the desire to explore the impact of different message
padding strategies on the network load, as explained [4] in one of
the drafts for the 0.5 tunnel routing.  (ooOOoo pretty pictures).
The scary part about what I found digging through those was that by
using some pretty simple hand-tuned padding breakpoints, padding to
those fixed sizes would still ended up with over 25% of the
bandwidth wasted.  Yeah, I know, we're not going to do that.
Perhaps y'all can come up with something better by digging through
that raw data.
[3] [4]                                  tunnel.html?rev=HEAD
Actually, that [4] link leads us into the state of the 0.5 plans for
the tunnel routing.  As Connelly posted [5], there has been a lot of
discussion lately on IRC about some of the drafts, with polecat,
bla, duck, nickster, detonate and others contributing suggestions
and probing questions (ok, and snarks ;).  After a little more than
a week, we came across a potential vulnerability with [4] dealing
with an adversary who was somehow able to take over the inbound
tunnel gateway who also controlled one of the other peers later in
that tunnel.  While in most cases this by itself wouldn't expose the
endpoint, and would be probabalistically hard to do as the network
grows, it still Sucks (tm).
So in comes [6].  This gets rid of that issue, allows us to have
tunnels of any length, and solves world hunger [7].  It does open
another issue where an attacker could build loops in the tunnel, but
based on a suggestion [8] Taral made last year regarding the session
tags used on ElGamal/AES, we can minimize the damage done by using
a series of synchronized pseudorandom number generators [9].
[5] [6]                                             tunnel-alt.html?rev=HEAD
[7] guess which statement is false?
[8] [9]                                 tunnel-alt.html?rev=HEAD
Don't worry if the above sounds confusing - you're seeing the
innards of some gnarly design issues being wrung out in the open.
If the above *doesnt* sound confusing, please get in touch, as we're
always looking for more heads to hash through this stuff :)
Anyway, as I mentioned on the list [10], next up I'd like to get the
second strategy [6] implemented to hash through the remaining
details.  The plan for 0.5 is currently to get all of the backwards
incompatible changes together - the new tunnel crypto, etc - and
push that as 0.5.0, then as that settles on the net, move on to the
other parts of 0.5 [11], such as adjusting the pooling strategy as
described in the proposals, pushing that as 0.5.1.  I'm hoping we
can still hit 0.5.0 by the end of the month, but we'll see.
[10] [11] * 3) i2pmail.v2
The other day postman put out a draft plan of action for the next
generation mail infrastructure [12], and it looks bloody cool.  Of
course, there are always yet more bells and whistles we can dream
up, but its got a pretty nice architecture in many ways.  Check out
what's been doc'ed up so far [13], and get in touch with the postman
with your thoughts!
[12] [13] 4) azneti2p_0.2
As I posted to the list [14], the original azneti2p plugin for
azureus had a serious anonymity bug.  The problem was that mixed
torrents where some users are anonymous and others are not, the
anonymous users would contact the non-anonymous users /directly/
rather than through I2P.  Paul Gardner and the rest of the azureus
devs were quite responsive and put out a patch right away.  The
issue I saw is no longer present in azureus v. 2203-b12 +
We haven't gone through and audited the code to review any potential
anonymity issues though, so "use at your own risk" (OTOH, we say the
same about I2P, prior to the 1.0 release).  If you're up for it, I
know the azureus devs would appreciate more feedback and bug reports
with the plugin.  We'll of course keep people informed if we find
out about any other issues.
[14] * 5) ???
Lots going on, as you can see.  I think thats about all I've got to
bring up, but please swing by the meeting in 40 minutes if there's
something else you'd like to discuss (or if you just want to rant
about the stuff above)

4) udp
5) ???
* 1) 0.5 status
Over the past week, there's been a lot of progress on the 0.5 side.
The issues we were discussing before have been resolved, dramatically
simplifying the crypto and removing the tunnel looping issue.  The
new technique [1] has been implemented and the unit tests are in
place.  Next up I'm putting together more of the code to integrate
those tunnels into the main router, then build up the tunnel
management and pooling infrastructure.  After thats in place, we'll
run it through the sim and eventually onto a parallel net to burn it
in before wrapping a bow on it and calling it 0.5.
* 2) sam.net
smeghead has put together a new port of the SAM protocol to .net -
c mono/gnu.NET compatible (yay smeghead!).  This is in cvs under
i2p/apps/sam/csharp/ with nant and other helpers - now all y'all
.net devs can start hacking with i2p :)
* 3) gcj progress
smeghead is definitely on a tear - at last count, with some
modifications the router is compiling under the latest gcj [2] build
(w00t!).  It still doesn't work yet, but the modifications to work
around gcj's confusion with some inner class constructs is definitely
progress.    Perhaps smeghead can give us an update?
[2] * 4) udp
Not much to say here, though Nightblade did bring up an interesting
set of concerns [3] on the forum asking why we're going with UDP.  If
you've got similar concerns or have other suggestions on how we can
address the issues I replied with, please, chime in!
[3] * 5) ???
Yeah, ok, I'm late with the notes again, dock my pay ;)  Anyway, lots
going on, so either swing by the channel for the meeting, check the
posted logs afterwards, or post up on the list if you've got
something to say.  Oh, as an aside, I've given in and started up a

@_subject: [i2p] 0.6 is available 
Hash: SHA1
Hi y'all,
After 5 months of crunching and testing on the 0.5 series of
releases, we've got the 0.6 build ready for your enjoyment.  In here
the big change is the new SSU [1] transport running on UDP instead of
TCP, allowing us to remove the per-peer thread and memory issues we
have seen so far.  In addition, some peer review by an anonymous
contributor has allowed us to improve some of the cryptographic
routines used in the tunnels and connection establishment.  A full
list of changes is as always up on the web [2].
This release includes the base SSU functionality - enabling
communication between reachable peers reliably and efficiently, but
0.6.1 will include support for "introducers", letting people behind
firewalls and NATs that they don't control join the network and
participate fully.  While the 0.6 release is deployed and we measure
its real world performance, we'll be crunching away on 0.6.1 with
the aim of getting that out later this summer.  After 0.6.1
stabilizes, we'll package 'er up and stick the "1.0" label on it and
move our focus towards providing more engaging user experiences.
Updating will be fairly easy, but due to a minor bug in previous
releases, you won't be able to use the 0 click update.  Instead,
just grab the i2pupdate.zip [3] and save it to your I2P install
directory, then click on "Graceful restart" [4].  After it restarts,
you'll want to "reseed" and make sure your router is reachable from
the outside world via UDP on your SSU port (8887 by default).  This
release is NOT backwards compatible, so please upgrade ASAP - a few
services are already on the new release - squid.i2p, cvs.i2p,
 and dev.i2p, so grab yours today :)
[3] [4] This release was a long time coming, both due to caution necessary
when designing, implementing, and testing a new transport protocol,
as well as my fairly hectic move to a new region and the resulting
infrequent internet access.  Thanks again for your patience, and
especially to the folks contributing code, content, and cash - we'd
be in tough shape without y'all!

* 1) Dev[eloper] status
After 4 cities in 4 countries, I'm finally getting settled and
churning through code again.  Last week I got the last of the
pieces to a laptop together, I'm no longer couch hopping, and
while I don't have net access at home, there are plenty of net
cafes around, so access is reliable (just infrequent and
That last point means that I won't be hanging out on irc as much
as before, at least until the fall (I've got a sublet through
August or so and will be looking for a place where I can get 24/7 net
access).  That doesn't, however, mean that I won't be doing as
much - I'll just be working largely on my own test network, pushing
out builds for live net testing (and, er, oh yeah, releases).  It
does mean though that we may want to move some discussions that used
to go on free form in  onto the list [1] and/or the forum [2] (I
do still read the  backlog though).  I haven't found a
reasonable place where I can go to for our development meetings yet,
so I won't be there this week, but perhaps by next week I'll have
found one.
Anyway, enough about me.
[1] [2] * 2) Dev[elopment] status
While I've been moving, there have been two main fronts that I've
been working on - documentation and the SSU transport (the later
only since I got the laptop).  The docs are still in progress, with
a big ol' scary overview one as well as a series of smaller
implementation docs (covering things like source layout, component
interaction, etc).
SSU progress is going well - the new ACK bitfields are in place, the
communication is dealing with (simulated) loss effectively, rates
are appropriate for the various conditions, and I've cleared some of
the uglier bugs I had run into previously.  I am continuing to test
these changes though, and once its appropriate we'll plot out a
series of live net tests for which we'll need some volunteers to
help out with.  More news on that front when its available.
* 3) Unit test bounty
I'm glad to announce that Comwiz has come forward with a series of
patches to claim the first phase of the unit test bounty [3]!  We are
still working through some minor details of the patches, but I've
received the updates and generated both the junit and clover reports
as necessary.  I expect we'll have the patches in CVS shortly, at
which point we'll put out Comwiz's testing docs.
As clover is a commercial product (free for OSS developers [4]),
only those who have installed clover and received their clover
license will be able to generate the clover reports.  In any case,
we'll be publishing the clover reports on the web periodically, so
those who don't have clover installed can still see how well our
test suite is doing.
[3] [4] * 4) Service outage
As many have probably noticed, (at least) one of the outproxies is
offline (squid.i2p), as is  dev.i2p, cvs.i2p, and my blog.
These are not unrelated events - the machine hosting them is hosed.
I'm working on getting it back up though, at which point those five
services will be back in operation.  Just an FYI.
* 5) ???
As there isn't a dev meeting on irc this week, if anyone else has
anything to bring up, please feel free to post up to the list or the
forum.  I've been following the discussions on the list, the forum,
and in  while I've been away, and have been glad to be able to
sit back and let other people answer most of the questions.
I do appreciate the patience people have had with the slow down in
releases as well, and realize that in some projects that would be
cause for alarm.  I2P is not, however, one of those projects - I've
been working on it fulltime for more than two years now and will not
stop until the needs that have been driving it are met.  I am not
wed to particular technologies for technologies sake, but merely
follow what seems to be the best path from here to where we need to
be, and as far as I can tell, we are still following the best path
available.  This summer, fall, and winter look to be a very exciting
time in the anonymity field.

* 1) 0.5.0.1
As discussed last week, a few hours after the meeting we pushed out
a new 0.5.0.1 release fixing the bugs in 0.5 that had caused the
massive number of tunnels being built (among other things).
Generally, this rev has improved things, but under wider testing,
we've come across some additional bugs that have been hitting a few
people.  In particular, the 0.5.0.1 rev can gobble tons of CPU if
you have a slow machine or your router's tunnels fail in bulk, and
some long lived I2PTunnel servers can gobble up RAM until it OOMs.
There has also been a long standing bug in the streaming lib, where
we can fail to establish a connection if just the right failures
Most of these (among others) have been fixed in cvs, but some remain
outstanding.  Once they're all fixed, we'll package 'er up and ship
it as a 0.5.0.2 release.  I'm not exactly sure when that'll be,
hopefully this week, but we'll see.
* 2) roadmap
After major releases, the roadmap [1] seems to get... adjusted.  The
0.5 release was no different.  That page reflects what I think is
reasonable and appropriate for the way forward, but of course, if
more people jump on to help out with things, it can certainly be
adjusted.  You'll notice the substantial break between 0.6 and
0.6.1, and while this does reflect lots of work, it also reflects
the fact that I'll be moving (its that time of the year again).

Detonate has started some work on a web based interface to manage
the addressbook entries (hosts.txt), and its looking pretty
promising.  Perhaps we can get an update from detonate during the

smeghead during the meeting?
* 4) i2p-bt
There's been some progress on the i2p-bt front, with a new 0.1.8
release addressing the azneti2p compatability issues as discussed
in last week's meeting.  Perhaps we can get an update from duck or
smeghead during the meeting?
Legion has also created a fork off the i2p-bt rev, merged in some
other code, patched up some things, and has a windows binary
available on his eepsite.  The announcement [2] seems to suggest
that source may be made available, though its not up on the eepsite
at the moment.  The i2p devs haven't audited (or even seen) the code
to that client, so those who need anonymity may want to get and
review a copy of the code first.
[2] There's also work on a version 2 of Legion's BT client, though I
don't know the status of that.  Perhaps we can get an update from
Legion during the meeting?
* 5) ???
Thats about all I have to say atm, lots and lots going on.  Anyone
else working on things that perhaps we can get an update for during
the meeting?

Hash: SHA1
Hi y'all, time for the weekly status notes
* Index
1) 0.5.0.5
2) UDP (SSU)
3) Q
4) ???
* 1) 0.5.0.5
Since y'all did such a great job at upgrading to 0.5.0.4 so quickly,
we're going to have the new 0.5.0.5 release come out after the
meeting.  As discussed last week, the big change is the inclusion of
the batching code, bundling multiple small messages together, rather
than giving them each their own full 1KB tunnel message.  While this
alone won't be revolutionary, it should substantially reduce the
number of messages passed, as well as the bandwidth used, especially
for services like IRC.
There will be more info in the release announcement, but two other
important things come up with the 0.5.0.5 rev.  First, we're
dropping support for users before 0.5.0.4 - there are well over 100
users on 0.5.0.4, and there are substantial problems with earlier
releases.  Second, there's an important anonymity fix in the new
build, that while it'd require some development effort to mount, its
not implausible.  The bulk of the change is to how we manage the
netDb - rather than play it fast and loose and cache entries all
over the place, we will only respond to netDb requests for elements
that have been explicitly given to us, regardless of whether or not
we have the data in question.
As always, there are bugfixes and some new features, but more info
will be forthcoming in the release announcement.
* 2) UDP (SSU)
As discussed off and on for the last 6-12 months, we're going to be
moving over to UDP for our interrouter communication once the 0.6
release is out.  To get us further down that path, we've got a first
draft of the transport protocol up in CVS @
Its a fairly simple protocol with the goals outlined in the doc, and
exploits I2P's capabilities to both authenticate and secure data, as
well as expose as little external information as possible.  Not even
the first part of a connection handshake is identifiable to someone
that isn't running I2P.  The behavior of the protocol is not fully
defined in the spec yet, such as how the timers fire or how the three
different semireliable status indicators are used, but it does cover
the basics of the encryption, packetization, and NAT hole punching.
None of it has been implemented yet, but will be soon, so feedback
would be greatly appreciated!
* 3) Q
Aum has been churning away on Q(uartermaster), a distributed store,
and the first pass of the docs are up [1].  One of the interesting
ideas in there seems to be a move away from a straight DHT towards
a memcached [2] style system, with each user doing any searches
entirely *locally*, and requesting the actual data from the Q server
"directly" (well, through I2P).  Anyway, some neat stuff, perhaps
if Aum is awake [3] we can wressle an update out of him?
[1] [2] [3] damn those timezones!
* 4) ???
Lots more going on, and if there were more than just a few minutes
until the meeting I could go on, but c'est la vie.  Swing on by
 in a few to chat.
