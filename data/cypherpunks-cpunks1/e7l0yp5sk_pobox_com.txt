SCHLOSS
                                     LEOPOLDSKRON
The most unique venue of its kind, situated in Salzburg - Austria, the very heart of Europe, welcomes you. The palace was built in 1740 as a summer residence for the Archbishop Leopold Firmian, and purchased by Max Reinhardt, the renowned theater director and co-founder of the Salzburg Festival, in 1918. When it was featured in the film "The Sound of Music", SCHLOSS LEOPOLDSKRON became famous throughout the world.
Today, the magnificent historic ambiance and its up-to-date infrastructure make SCHLOSS LEOPOLDSKRON an ideal site for residential conferences and seminars, and a particularly attractive destination for incentive and special interest group travelers visiting Mozart's place of birth.  On request, we put together for you suitable incentive packages that include on- and off-site activities, such as visits to the Salzburger Festival or other cutural events, a day-trip to the lake district, a concert or a gala diner at the palace, for instance.
