@_subject: SAFE Bill is a Disaster--"Use a cipher, go to prison" 
I'd like to point out that the key phrase in there seems to be "under any law in effect on the effective date of this chapter"  -- altho
it's gobbledegooked,
the intent seems to say "if there is no law in effect mandating GAK when
this bill becomes
law, there can never be a law passed which does"  Or in other words, it has
the effect of making
GAK no better, or worse, than under current law, while preventing passage
of GAK laws in the future.

@_subject: Privacy news: Oakland Cameras, Levi employee files, FileGate 
Brief radio piece on the red-light cameras in S.F. --- red-light running
to be down at the 4 intersections where cameras are installed; some
well-placed official was
quoted as saying "The cameras are definitely having an effect on people's
behavior." Yes, a
Good Thing.  They are continuing to move forward with plans to install more
This is fine for red-light-running.  I'm just worried about the day when
the cameras
have an effect on people's behavior with respect to what they say, whom
they associate with, the clothes they wear, the thoughts they think...
How do you hack a camera?

@_subject: unSAFE 
comment, though, on this caveat in the paragraphs you indicate:
   "(2) ITEMS NOT REQUIRING LICENSES. ...
(but only to the extent that the authority of such Act is not exercised to
extend controls imposed
    under this Act) .... "
Seems to me that it says "the administration can still control xyz under
the EAA, TWE, EEP, etc but not if such control extends the controls defined
under HR695 SAFE"
Looks like language to assuage the powers that be, while it creates
AMBIGUITY and the need for interpretation (AKA court intervention) when
some administration tries to overstep it's bounds.  I don't think that's
necessarily bad, since legislation has never existed that is ironclad anyway: it's always subject to some runaway Attorney General getting weird,
as we have seen plenty of times.
... etc ...

but THEN noticed the paragraph is attached to the EAA, not SAFE.
Never mind.
SAFE looks more ominous ....

@_subject: Pro-Crypto Arguments 
Such was the thrust of my question posed to the Senate hearings via netcast:
"Is secret speed protected speech"
For if not, then it is a simple matter by extension to require that all
communications be in the lingua franca of the listener, obviously
The respondent seemed to think that 'secret speech' is protected, but obviously there are counterarguments.

Anyone doubting that the center of gravity of world power is shifting
would do well to ponder: 100 of the world's top CEO's are going to Bill Gates' house to hear him expound on what the future will look
IF that doesn't make you nervous nothing will.  It's at least as nervewracking as anything Clinton admin. might do.

YOU BET!
Similar thoughts went thru my mind as I drove by the Lake the other day.
Secret Service is involved in security preparations, somewhat because Gore will be there. God, the thought of all those marketing banalities!
