The depressing thing is that AOL as at least 14 million paying subscribers.
It may even be up to 20 million. Hotmail has 30 million active accounts. The
unilluminati are the future of the internet.

The scene from Babylon 5 is hardly original. The same thing happened in
Vietnam, The Korean War, WW2, WW1....
This is war, and in war innocent people die to further the cause of the
leaders. You just have to hope and pray that some good will come out of it.

How do you plan on accomplishing this? The courts have said that they will
not design computers. Since freezing an API is tantamount to computer
design, this isn't going to happen any time soon.
More generlly, API's only freeze when the system is dead. Windows has, for
better or for worse, many years of life left in it. This means one way or
the other, MS will extend Windows as it needs. For them, freezing Windows
would be killing one of their cash cows.
This is also very difficult to implement. How do you choose what OS/s to
port to? If MS can't expect to earn a profit from the port, then MS is
dumping software, which is not legal. Why choose x86 UNIX's (less than 10
million users) Why not MVS (more than 20 million users)?
Attila, I think you're jealous, and confused by MS's success. You don't
understand why someone would choose Windows (NT or 98) when OS's are
available that have a better core. And you desperatly want to change that.
Some terrible truths...
 Only MS, and Apple know how to make and OS that the mass market wants.
Apple unfortunatly doesn't know how to make hardware that the mass market
wants.  If people made decisions rationally, advertisements would consist of
nothing but readings from Consumer Reports.
 The typical computer user is getting less, not more intelligent. If an
x86 unix is to gain mass market popularity, it must become vastly more
usable. Most people don't know and don't care about the internals of the OS.
They don't want to think about it. They just want their documents and games
to be there when they click on them, and they want to surf the internet. Not
that Windows is perfect for usability, but it's a hell of a lot better than

An advanced, nuclear hardened encryption device, is an encryption device
that will still work after a nuke has gone off in the vicinity. Nuclear
bombs emit EMP's which destroy sensitive electronics.

It's a little bit more complicated than that. RC-6, which also uses data
dependant rotations is patent free.

In many newer block ciphers, the key schedule comes from a fairly good one
way hash of the key. Take a look at RC6, or TwoFish. Essentially this
accomplishes the same thing as using a good LSFR.

@_subject: Speed records, and brute force state of the art. 
WASHINGTON-The Energy Department will take delivery on Wednesday of what the
Government says is the world's fastest computer, capable of a peak
performance of 3.88 trillion calculations, or teraflops, a second. Just to simplify things, let's assume that 1 flop == 1 decryption. I know
that's not true, but it's very close, and it's certainly less than one order
of magnitude off.
So, with this assumption how long does it take to break various key sizes?
56 bits -- 2^56 / 3.88E12 = 5.2 hours
64 bits -- 2^64 / 3.88E12 = 55 days
80 bits -- 2^80 / 3.88E12 = 9873 years
128 bits -- 2^128 / 3.88E12 = 2.8E18 years.
And now you know.

Hi Bernardo;
TEMPEST isn't a cipher, but a technique. Essentially, your monitor is a great big RF emitter. As it's electron gun
turns off and on to make the phosphor screen glow, it's emitting all kinds
of radio frequencies that betray the image on the screen. A tempest attack
is a receiver that can tune to a monitor, and reconstruct the image from the
RF the monitor is emitting. Supposedly such equipment costs about $500.00 Harvey "Know it All" Rook.
