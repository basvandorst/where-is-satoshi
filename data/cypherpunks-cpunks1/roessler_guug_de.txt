Making proprietary changes to GPLed software for your own use seems
to be fine with the GPL.  The problem occurs if you are giving away
changed versions of software: While GPL will force you to give your
distributed software's users the same freedom you enjoyed yourself
when creating the software, PD won't preserve that freedom.
Thus, GPL is the license model which most consequently follows the
freedom for end users thread of thinking.

I have to partially object here:  If code is to be used
commercially, lawyers can ask the copyright holders for a different
license, and they may quite well succeed even if the original
distribution was under GPL.

Wrong.  As long as it's your own code you are talking about, you can
release it under whatever license you want -  e.g., you can give
away binary code as part of a proprietary application, and you can
give away binary and source code stand-alone under GLP, LGPL, BSD
license, Artistic License, whatever.
