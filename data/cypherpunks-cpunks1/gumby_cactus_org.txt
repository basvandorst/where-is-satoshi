@_subject: Wiretap Chip Questions 
I am working on articles and article proposals for some local media
outlets. I need to get some specific information regarding the
Clipper Chip (aka Wiretap Chip) proposal:
1) What is a rough estimate of how long it would take a brute-force
   attack on an 80-bit key using a parallel architecture
   system costing less than, say, $25,000 two to three years from now.
2) How, in your opinion, would this affect the creation of international
   standards for encryption? Would this help or hinder development of the
   global economy?
3) I understand that the scheme relies on the secrecy of the encryption
   algorithm to protect the transmission of keys at the beginning of    a session. (It uses a system key to encyrpt the keys for the two
   devices). If the algorithm is successfully reverse-engineered,
   does this compromise the entire system?
4) I am assuming that this system would be just as vulnerable to a "known    plaintext attack" as other schemes. Is this correct?

Along the same lines, I am left scratching my head about the "baroque activities in the vault." Surely this is going to add substantially to the cost of these chips over a system
that uses a known algorithm and non-escrowed keys.
Given that such a system would be cheaper to produce and would offer stronger security, I think it is not especially
inflamatory to suggest that the government is contemplating
either an outright ban or the strong discouragement of alternative systems.

How are they going to produce them at these prices and in that quantity
given the "baroque activities in the vault" described by Denning?
(Not to mention the destruction of the laptop computer... :-)

My point was that given the additional escrow security measures described
by D. Denning, I don't see how these prices or volumes will be possible.
It is possible that:
   1) Denning is describing the process incorrectly, or was merely
      outlining how the chips would be produced in the best of all
      possible worlds.
   2) The manufacturer actually has many such vaults, and the escrow agencies
      will provide sufficient staff and disposable laptop computers       at no charge to the manufacturer.
   3) The chips will not, in fact, be produced in substantial volume
      (e.g. >1M / year would require over 3,000 "sessions" per working day)
You responded:
(all of which I am familiar with)
I was referring to:
[... from D. Denning's sci.crypt posting ...]
All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer
information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
                                         ^^^^ suggests only one vault
At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1
into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values
serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.
[... technical info on key generation deleted ...]
As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
assurance that no information is left behind.
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies.
