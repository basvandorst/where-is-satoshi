Quoting Dr. Evil (drevil at sidereal.kz):
Not only that, but if the FBI didn't exist, the Cypherpunks would have to
create them.

Declan is a pedophile?  When did this occur?  And why is that filthy pervert
writing for respected media outlets?

And the _only_ people who benefit are the power-mongers in government, the
military, and big-business.  Odd, that.

Quoting Anonymous (cripto at ecn.org):
This will be a simple threat to mitigate. The government simply needs to require that every male carry a Foreskin
Certificate of Authenticity.  Obviously for women, a similar certificate will
be necessary to authenticate breasts and pregnancies.  Particularly paranoid
regimes might also view moles and bunyans with suspicion and mandate further
security measures.  For the public safety, of course.

Quoting John Young (jya at pipeline.com):
More to the point, such systems provide the imprecision and convenience which
some rigid and domineering minds need in order to impose their more subtle
and complex belief systems on others.
Only by convention.
Which are only useful if they are used as creative alternatives instead of
forms within which convenient and common ideas can be re-expressed.
Beware of false dictionaries and lexicons.
Intellectual freedom and speech is only as good as the persons who excercise
it -- and in this culture, it is mediocre at best.
But of course for effect the statesman's sage utterings are unequalled.
You're losing it.
Or pretend.
