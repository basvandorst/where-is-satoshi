Let's get one thing straight. I hate how Gmail does threading. IT SUCKS.
Anyone miss that? GMail threading SUCKS. Maybe even their sniffers
will catch that. GMail SUCKS is always a winner but I want THREADING
in the string.
Oh, horse shit. Physics predates everything but it the last to be
discovered and explored. Law and Religion are inexorably twined. The
predecessor of religion, superstition, gives rise to many things.
Finance and Politics are after-effects of everything else.
You did that one up right -n- proper, inchoate.
Given that their sole enforcement arm is lawsuit, you are inchoate again.
It proves that they can bring a lawsuit and on occasion, win. Duh.
Again: you demonstrate why that code is not widespread already. Ted
wrote code. It still isn't widespread. Why fucking not?

The Unabomber's Code
This is interesting. Ted Kaczynski wrote in code:
     In a small journal written in code, he documented his thoughts
about the crimes he was committing. That code was so difficult, a source
says the CIA couldn't crack it -- until someone found the key itself
among other documents, and then translated it.
Look at the photo. It was a manual, pencil-and-paper cipher. Does anyone
know the details of the algorithm?

Because for better or worse, Microsoft is still the dominant OS provider
around and is likely to remain so for some time to come.
Let me restate that in a way that even a curmudgeon like yourself should
have no trouble digesting:
"...If quality tools are not available, then individuals and businesses
will not use them. As long as communication encryption is not widespread,
crypto rights will be vulnerable to attack as a special interest issue
vs public

Oh goody, someone looked that up. I chose that nym carefully, of course it

You didn't follow the link and read the rest of the quote, did you? What
makes you think I was speaking only of code?
Yes, and Stalin dismissively asked an advisor how many divisions the Pope
had. You aren't really advancing a might-makes-right argument are you? It
doesn't always work that way RAH, you ought to know that by now.
Yes, you've advanced that notion before. That sort of penurious antipathy is
why encrypted communications as a matter of course will never catch on. Not
among the masses where it is most needed. Outside of a few specialized
transactions of the financial nature, which is not at all what cypherpunkism is
really about. Or at least, what it used to be about.

You missed by a whole continent, that's the latest salvo in a barrage
though. If the message is unassailable, attack the messenger. That
comes through loud and clear. I thought you were better than that,
RAH. I haven't trolled at all in these last couple of replies either,
perhaps you wished I had so you could dismiss these uncomfortable
truths more easily.
No. Galileo advanced a fact and might swatted him for it, that the
Earth was the center of the universe has never been a fact. There are
other "facts" that simply aren't so despite consensus to the contrary.
It sounds like you are engaging in your own rationalizations.
You haven't been paying attention, have you? A refresher: the EFF is
suing AT&T for getting into bed with the NSA and the widespread
eavesdropping that has been engaged in. Widespread encryption has been
needed for quite some time, it hasn't been particularly wanted because
it isn't easy or accessible. Yet.
Prove it. You could use a few extra million dollars, couldn't you?
Let's review. I asked why Mixmaster software was not available for the
Win32 platform. The underlying question, why fully-encrypted
communications were not more widespread - you've more than amply
demonstrated why.

I haven't posted here for a while. I certainly haven't posted under my

I'm wondering: No updates since Jan 2003? Last signing in Jan 2004?
brings a June 2006 date, but still.
Are there no compiled installables for the Win32 platform?
Is ubiquitous anonymity really a bastion of *nix geeks or do
we really want it to be ubiquitous? An installable that works
on Win98/2k/XP is a bare minimum, these days. Anything
else is glique (geek + clique).
Bah, I see why this list is in decline: all punk, no cypher. I
have a day job, I can't be bothered with learning Perl and
C and some other nonsense, I need a tool I can wield. Not
some learning curve with no light at the end of the tunnel,
except what I might create by my own invention.
This list needs a low-level format. Tim was on the right path,
at some point. Pity him now.

I do not need to learn C to benefit from Mixmaster software, your
snipjob damaged the context of what I wrote.
I do need Mixmaster software that works on the Win32 platform in that
last case, and that is the major, non-troll point both you and Eugen
glossed over.
No he didn't, he kneejerked. So did you.
Anyone else? Why is there still no functional software for the Win32 platform?

for that reason, not because the actual content went away.
As a cypherpunk yourself, you are a fucking idiot if you think a
real cypherpunk will click on an obfuscated URL. Shame on you, RAH.

It's my pah-ty, I can whine if I want to. BTW, how does pointing
out an issue, not qualify as fixing the problem at hand? Hmmm?
I know. The point, which you missed, was RAH sending a shortened URL.
If RAH wants to send URLs like that, he can. But he damages his own
cypherpunk street cred, with each shortened URL. Because with that
shorty URL, he makes you and me engage in labor we should not have
to engage in, if only he had sent the real (target) URL instead.
The question we need to be asking ourselves, why on earth did RAH
go to the extra effort of creating that short URL in the first
place? He's a veteran of this list, what is his angle? Or the angle
of whatever it is that has its whole arm up his ass, if he really
can't defend himself. Which he hasn't, yet. Tim May can't be blamed
for short URLs.
Do you get it now?
Even then, bit.ly or shor.ty or as.sy are not guaranteed to be
available in 1, 5, 10 years. Example? Shurl.com and yes, it did
used to exist: Can you hear me now/yet? WOULD IT HELP IF I SHOUTED?
Yes, no, and you lose. His shorty URL caused you to engage in labor
you should not have had to engage in - and you were probably exposed
to ads - or links to ads, as a result.
When will strong encryption be baked into email clients, so that
discussions like this are not necessary anymore?
And, your demimed email client sucks too.

It looks to me like the author blathered inchoate about three moral

one: the CIA or other controllers losing control to a hostile actor.
This is not implausible, we've already seen some college kids spoof
the GPS signal and in Iran, one was landed while under the control
of someone else. Or at least, while not under our control. How long
until one is used to blow up stuff we don't want blown up?
