@_subject: A Nice Summary of Motives for Clipper 
Mr. May's arguments are eloquent and convincing as usual, but it
occurs to me that one important point is being overlooked in this
discussion: the algorithm will not be a secret forever.
     Even in the worst case scenario, where all major players in the
industry knuckle under to the government (including those currently
planning to use other systems), the situation will be resolved as soon
as either Clipper or one of its designers is reverse-engineered.  The
more widespread is the chip, the greater the blow to the government.
With the algorithm known there is no way to prevent compatible,
non-escrowed, devices from being used, and it would be costly and
embarrassing to attempt to recall 100 million "secure" chips.
     So, how long will we likely have to put up with this abomination?

     It would, however, prevent the cooperating remailers from being
shut down due to abusers.  Isn't that one objective?

     I've considered this option as well, but that is precisely what
Detweiler wants people to do: stop using anonymous remailers.  I
advocate the following alternatives:
          - Cypherpunks should use software such as is used by the
            extropians list.  This allows each subscriber to ignore
            specific people or threads more easily than by using a
            local filter.  I believe it also requires that each
            address used by a subscriber be registered.  This could
            be modified to allow messages to be posted anonymously
            by the server but also allow exclusion of such posts
            by users.
          - People who value anonymity and want to prevent SQUISH-
            like abuses could run modified remailers that allow the
            rejection of messages from particular sites.  If enough
            such remailers were available, they could also agree to
            reject messages from remailers without anti-abuse
            policies.  If enough people think this is worth the
            effort it could result in several different sets of
            remailers, each with different policies -- emergent law.
          - If you feel that a posting is out of line and you're
            reasonably certain of its origin, send email to the
            responsible party, his/her postmaster, and anyone else
            who might have an impact on the problem.  Enough people
            doing this will at least waste some of the offender's
            time and slow down the abuses.  While I respect the
            postmaster's support of free speech, I suggest that
            those affected by the exercise of that right are
            justified in exercising that right in return.  A
            working anarchy depends on such feedback.
     If anyone running the services mentioned above is interested in
making the modifications suggested but lacks the time, drop me a line.
I'll be happy to donate some coding time to this issue.
     If any of this doesn't make sense, I blame my cold medicine.
