@_subject: CDR: Minesweeper could hold key to Net security 
By Gareth Cook, Boston Globe Staff, 11/1/2000 The key to solving one of the most vexing and profound problems of modern mathematics could lie in a most unusual place: Minesweeper, a simple computer game that rivals solitaire as an office time-waster. The math problem, called the "P versus NP conjecture," asks why some questions are so difficult to answer with computers. It is considered so important that in May the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge offered a $1 million prize for a solution. Proving the conjecture false would mean that modern encryption technology, the foundation of electronic commerce, would be open to easy attack.
In the spring issue of the journal Mathematical Intelligencer, a British specialist in mathematical logic demonstrated that the conjecture would be false if someone can crack Minesweeper, a game in which players race to clear a path through a sea of explosives.
Mathematicians hope the insight, the topic of an open lecture tonight at Harvard University, would bring the public in on a drama that, among specialists, has generated the same fervor that mariners of another age once brought to their search for a passage around the world.
''I have sometimes dreamt that someone found a solution,'' said Michael Sipser, an MIT math professor who has spent two decades and ''about 15,000 hours'' searching for the secret. The dreams ''filled me with an intense mixture of curiosity and envy,'' he said.
Engineers are already building processors that run faster than a previous generation could imagine, powering computers that can conquer chess or generate directions from Boston to Walla Walla, Wash., in an instant. But the ''P versus NP conjecture,'' Sipser said, is an attempt to draw, with mathematical certainty, the boundary beyond which computers, no matter how powerful, cannot cross.
''This is enormously fundamental,'' said Ian Stewart, who is delivering the Harvard lecture and is a columnist for the magazine Scientific American and professor at the University of Warwick in England.
Minesweeper, which is included free with the Windows operating system, does not look like the kind of game that would fascinate theorists. The gamer clicks squares of a grid on which mines have been hidden. Numbers then appear, indicating the number of mines in surrounding squares. Using these clues, the aim is to find all the mines.
Intrigued by the kind of logic puzzles the game generates, Richard Kaye of the University of Birmingham in England posed ''the minesweeper consistency problem'': Given a board of numbers, is it possible to determine whether the clues are consistent with the rules?
This question took him to outer reaches of computer science and to the essence of the ''P versus NP conjecture.'' Many common problems, including multiplying large numbers or putting a list in alphabetical order, are what computer scientists call ''P'' problems, readily solvable by computer.
On the other hand, ''NP'' problems seem far more difficult; the only known solution is to break the problem into a large, often prohibitively large, number of P problems. One example is the classic ''traveling salesman'' question: If a salesman has to visit certain cities, what is the fastest route? Breaking the codes used to protect Internet communications is also an NP problem.
But perhaps, some mathematicians have suggested, the NP problems are actually no more difficult than P problems; they just look that way because nobody has been inventive enough to find an easy way to solve them. Although mathematicians assume this is wrong, they still have not been able to prove the resulting ''P versus NP conjecture'' true after more than two decades of intense labor and several false alarms.
Kaye's contribution, scrawled on loose sheets of paper during his daily train ride to work, was showing that the ''minesweeper consistency problem'' is ''NP complete,'' that a solution would mean that all NP problems are easily solvable.
So, write a program that can decode Minesweeper for any size board, and you will join the pantheon of mathematical greats, alongside Euler and Pythagoras.
And, of course, there is that million-dollar prize.
The prize offered for the ''P versus NP conjecture'' is one of seven different million-dollar prizes for what the Clay Mathematics Institute considers to be the most important mathematical challenges of the new millennium, according to Clay president Arthur Jaffe.
In the meantime, word that minesweeper has attained a new veneer of respectability will no doubt be treated with caution by recovered addicts.
''The first night I started playing it, my wife woke up at 3 in the morning and said, `What are you doing?''' said Rick Kane, an orthopedic surgeon at Noble Hospital in Westfield. ''Now,'' he said with a tentative laugh, ''I'm going to have to start playing again.''

@_subject: CDR: Net dad Vint Cerf slams RIP 
By: Lucy Sherriff
 Posted: 03/11/2000 at 11:23 GMT
Vinton Cerf, one of the founding fathers of the Internet, has attacked the RIP bill as a dangerous new piece of legislation. Speaking at the Compsec conference in London yesterday he commented: "Oh my god. A lot of us in the US are very worried about the RIP Bill, it has raised some of the same concerns as Carnivore." He said that he acknowledged that it was a matter of balancing an individual's right to privacy with the need to protect society as a whole, but was worried about the circumstances in which it comes into force. As the online population grows the issues of personal privacy and corporate security will become more and more important, he said. Indeed an example is the subject of a public key as a global ID - and the potential for abuse inherent in it. If we are uniquely associated with a number then anyone can use that to find out everything about us including things we might rather they not know. He says that while he "cannot stress enough the importance of a workable public key infrastructure," anyone who believes encryption will solve all the difficult issues in the online world is "clearly insane." Cerf says that the solution to this is to treat it rather like we do credit cards. Use multiple public keys, each one can be uniquely associated with your relationship with a company, rather than with you personally. While stressing that as more business is done online the security and reliability of the net will become synonymous with the security of the economy, with "very serious implications" for a network failure, Cerf is keen to point out some positive trends too. Since 1988 the Internet has been growing at between 90 and 100 per cent every year, and for the first time every country in Africa has some - albeit limited - access to the Internet. By 2009 half the world population is expected to be surfing the web in some form. Things can only get better? We'll see. �

@_subject: CDR: FBI Agent Sues To Report Misconduct  
By Michael J. Sniffen
Associated Press Writer
Friday, Nov. 3, 2000; 5:56 p.m. EST
WASHINGTON PP A 20-year veteran FBI agent went to court Friday seeking the right to report to President Clinton and key members of Congress what he considers serious and criminal misconduct by federal workers during a top secret, undercover national security operation. FBI Director Louis Freeh and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder have denied agent Joseph G. Rogoskey permission to relay his allegations to Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and House and Senate committees that oversee the FBI. In a lawsuit against the FBI and Justice Department, Rogoskey said that as an undercover agent he "witnessed acts of serious misconduct and violation of federal law by employees of the federal government during the course of their employment." FBI spokesman Bill Carter said, "We understand all the allegations of government misconduct have long been appropriately addressed." Now on paid administrative leave, Rogoskey spent 12 years, 1987 through 1998, on top-secret, undercover operations involving some of the government's deepest secrets that are accessible only to specified people. Rogoskey is barred from telling his lawyer, Stephen Kohn, any details of the operation or the alleged misconduct. Kohn said he understands only that "it doesn't involve anyone stealing money. It involves what they were ordered and permitted by the government to do in this operation." Like the FBI, Holder advised Rogoskey by letter that he should report "whistle-blower-type allegations" to internal FBI investigators or Justice inspector general agents who "have the appropriate security clearances." But Kohn said, "Keeping whistle-blower allegations within the institution that authorized the misconduct does not serve the public interest and raises grave constitutional questions." Rogoskey first reported his allegations to his immediate supervisor in late 1997, "promptly upon observing them," Kohn said. "We don't know if the FBI has fixed the problem," Kohn said, because Rogoskey has been on leave since the summer of 1998. Since making the allegations, the FBI has retaliated against Rogoskey, the lawsuit said. The suit said this included an allegation of misconduct against Rogoskey, of which FBI investigators cleared him; efforts by superiors "to call into question his integrity"; and recently threatening to fire him for medical reasons if he fails a fitness for duty exam. The FBI's Carter responded: "Any internal disciplinary or other employment problems Mr. Rogoskey may have experienced are completely unrelated to providing the earlier allegations." Kohn said: "Fitness reviews are extremely intrusive. They include psychiatric exams, interviews with his wife and examination of his sex life." A fitness exam was ordered of another FBI whistle-blower client of Kohn's, Frederic Whitehurst, the FBI chemist whose allegations led to an inspector general's finding the FBI Laboratory engaged in sloppy science and gave biased testimony for the prosecution. "Even though Whitehurst was found fit, the FBI tried to discredit him with material from the fitness exam," Kohn said. Kohn said Rogoskey has applied for workman's compensation because two doctors concluded he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his work. "He has work-related injuries because they kept him undercover too long and from the retaliation," Kohn said. FBI officials have said that agents who spend long periods undercover can suffer tensions from maintaining dual personalities. In the lawsuit, Rogoskey asked the U.S. District Court here to decide whether he can transmit his allegations to Clinton, Albright and congressional oversight committees, to bar the government from retaliation and to process his workman's compensation claim instead of ordering a fitness review. Because of secrecy rules, Rogoskey submitted his allegations in a sealed envelope to the FBI's publication review clearance board in May 1999. The agent had no publisher, wasn't seeking compensation and did not intend to publish the material for the general public, but wanted permission to send it to the named officials, Kohn said. FBI attorney Lyn Brown "denied the permission the next day by phone and said the information in the envelope should have been transported by armed guard." Kohn said. Freeh and Holder later upheld that denial. ) Copyright 2000 The Associated Press

@_subject: CDR: US report urges Arafat to use torture for peace  
An influential think-tank advises Palestinian Authority to ruthlessly repress militant elements without regard for basic human rights By Robert Fisk in Gaza 6 November 2000 Palestinian leaders have been shocked to read an American think-tank report which urges them to act "ruthlessly" against opponents of the Oslo agreement � even if this involves "excessive force", trials without due process of law and "interrogation methods that border on psychological and/or physical torture." A draft copy of the report by the influential Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which has close links with the United States government, has been published on the internet and circulated among dozens of members of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, including Yasser Arafat's most senior intelligence officers. The report says that even if peace follows the "Second Intifada", "both sides [Palestinian and Israeli] will be forced to conduct aggressive [sic] security operations for years to come" which "can have a high price tag in terms of human rights." By way of comparison, it adds that British security forces in Northern Ireland "balanced" what it calls "effective security" with human rights � even though "the British used excessive force, abused human rights, and used extreme interrogation methods and torture." Amnesty International and other human rights groups have frequently condemned the use of arbitrary false arrest, detention and torture by Arafat's "muhabarrat" security apparatus, pointing out that CIA operatives appear to have been complicit in these abuses. Far from denouncing these practices, however, the draft CSIS report appears to encourage their use, stating that "such measures also tend to work". The document is dated 18 October and bears the name of Anthony H Cordesman � a former national security assistant to failed Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain � who is now holder of the Arleigh A Burke Chair in Strategy at the CSIS, named after the former Chief of US Naval Operations. His document is heavily referenced to CIA, State Department and Israeli sources and, according to Palestinian officials here, has been circulated within the US and Israeli governments. Entitled "Peace and War: Israel versus the Palestinians", it recounts the turbulent history of Israeli-Palestinian relations since the 1993 Oslo agreement although its bias is obvious from the frequent use of "terrorist" to describe violent Arab groups and the almost ubiquitous use of "extremist" in reference to their violent Israeli opposite numbers. It excuses the use of Israeli live bullets against stone-throwers, adding that CS gas and rubber bullets are often "not effective in stopping large groups" and that "troops cannot let mobs armed with stones and Molotov cocktails close on their positions, or rely on the riot control gear used in civil disobedience." In a section headed "The Need for Palestinian Authority Ruthlessness and Efficiency", it states "there will be no future peace, or stable peace process, if the Palestinian security forces do not act ruthlessly and effectively. They must react very quickly and decisively in dealing with terrorism and violence if they are to preserve the momentum of Israeli withdrawal, the expansion of Palestinian control, and the peace process. They must halt civil violence even if this sometimes means using excessive force by the standards of Western police forces. They must be able to halt terrorist and paramilitary action by Hamas and Islamic Jihad even if this means interrogations, detentions and trials that are too rapid and lack due process. If they do not, the net cost to both peace and the human rights of most Palestinians will be devastating." The report says that permission must be obtained for any publication of the contents, but copies have now been circulated throughout the Palestinian Authority, including the offices of Mohamed Dahalan and Jibril Rajoub, respectively heads of Arafat's "Preventative Security" in Gaza and Ramallah. Both Dahalan and Rajoub were sent to Langley, Virginia, for what was called "human rights training" by US government intelligence services. Although it condemns "Israeli terrorism" � a phrase used only once and in reference to Jewish settlers' groups � the document concludes with chilling advice to both Palestinians and Israelis. "Every counter-terrorist force that has ever succeeded has had to act decisively and sometimes violently," it says. "Effective counter-terrorism relies on interrogation methods that border on psychological and/or physical torture, arrests and detentions that are 'arbitrary' by the standards of civil law, break-ins and intelligence operations that violate the normal rights of privacy, levels of violence in making arrests that are unacceptable in civil cases, and measures that involve the innocent (or at least not provably directly guilty) in arrests and penalties." The issue, the report adds, "is not whether extreme security measures will sometimes be used, or whether they are sometimes necessary. The issue is rather how many such acts occur, how well-focused they are on those who directly commit terrorism, and how justified they are in terms of their relative cost-benefits." Palestinian officials here noted with surprise how accurate was the report's list of escalating Israeli responses to the current low-intensity war, from Israeli mobilisation of armour to the sealing off of Palestinian towns and "the use of helicopter gunships and snipers to provide mobility and suppressive fire". Apparently based on a 1996 Israeli test plan codenamed "Operation Field of Thorns", the military responses end with the "forced evacuation" of Palestinians from "sensitive areas". Palestine Authority officers, however, were taken aback to read that the PA's "military strength" includes a Lockheed Jetstar aircraft. The plane, they point out, happens to be Arafat's personal executive jet.

@_subject: CDR: Big Brother looms in British offices 
Law permitting employers to snoop on
workers' communications causes concern
JEN ROSS
Special to The Globe and Mail; With a file from reporter Natalie Southworth Thursday, November 9, 2000
LONDON -- Amid the clatter of keyboards in a busy Internet caf in Central London, a man in a navy suit stares glassy-eyed at his flat computer screen.
Owen is e-shopping for a new laptop -- one of the many personal activities which, he says, he does not dare undertake from work.
On Oct. 24, a controversial new British law came into force that allows employers to read employees' e-mail and monitor which Web sites they are visiting during work hours.
"Lots of people are really scared about this," says Owen, who would not disclose his surname.
Owen is expressing the worry of a growing number of British employees who are turning to Internet cafs and non-work e-mail systems to escape the feeling that Big Brother is watching them at work.
To be sure, e-mail in the office has never been totally secure. As a network administrator, Owen has had access to his co-workers' e-mail.
But what's new is that now employers can do the monitoring -- they can do it legally, and possibly use the information against their workers. The new law, drawn up under the Regulation of Informatory Power (RIP) Act, gives British companies wide and unprecedented powers of surveillance that other Western countries will be watching closely.
In Canada, court rulings have shown that monitoring employee messages can be legal as long as employees are warned in advance. A growing body of U.S. common law indicates that companies have the right to monitor e-mail. But no specific law in either country empowers employers to read e-mail.
In Britain, even before the new legislation, there were cases of employees being fired for booking on-line holidays during work hours. In September, 40 workers with cellphone company Orange PLC were let go for exchanging "inappropriate" material over internal e-mail.
Owen has also seen co-workers fired for forwarding obscene jokes. But now he fears employers could take unfair advantage of their sweeping new powers and increasingly seek to monitor more information.
Even some senior managers oppose the law. Morgan Davis, vice-president of management consulting firm Kaiser Associates International Inc., is in the position of potentially becoming an e-mail snooper -- and a snoopee.
"It's a very control-freak type of atmosphere to let an employer read all their employees' e-mail under them," Mr. Davis says. "You can't build trust that way."
He says the law can only be just if it allows employers' e-mail to be put under the same scrutiny by employees.
Mr. Davis believes the hierarchical nature of the law could potentially have a poisonous effect: "It highlights the divide between employer and employee."
But for others, this workplace surveillance isn't a problem.
"My e-mail and Web use is provided and paid for by my employer so I don't mind the monitoring," says Tom Elliott, a law reporter for a property magazine. "I think the only people who need to worry are those who are abusing their access."
Besides snooping on e-mail, the new law allows employers to listen in to and record phone calls, check who an employee is calling on a cellphone and search the hard drives of laptops, if these items are provided through work.
"What if you have to ring the doctor and you can only do it during work hours and your employer can monitor your calls? You could find out you are pregnant or HIV-positive," says Annabel Crooke, a recruitment co-ordinator for Monitor Co., a strategic consulting firm. "There are certain things you just don't want your employer to know."
The new law responds to businesses' argument that they need wide access to staff communications -- for example, to answer business mail sent to workers who are home sick, to check for computer viruses, or to investigate leaks of business information.
"Personal" e-mail is still supposed to be off-limits. However, most e-mail is not labelled to differentiate it. Once the boss has read far enough to realize the message is private, the damage has been done.
Among the law's critics are unions and anti-surveillance campaigners, who argue that it stomps on privacy rights. There is talk of a challenge under the new European Human Rights act, which became law in Britain on Oct. 1.
And some companies are simply choosing not to take advantage of the new spying powers at their disposal.
Still, there are those who find comfort in the existence of the law.
"I'd like to know that I have the right to do it, although I might not actually do it," says bank manager Tom Binks, commenting on the ability to monitor e-mail, phone calls and Web use.
He says many employers won't be bothered to spend the time and money to do the monitoring. The law may prove to be a scare tactic that is a deterrent on its own.
Another controversial aspect of the law is that it allows greater access to employee communications by police and intelligence services. The RIP act obliges Internet service providers to install listening posts if requested, so that police or intelligence people can monitor e-mail traffic.
As a self-employed writer, Walter Kennedy is not subject to the prying eyes of an employer, but says he is outraged that the state can now easily and legally intercept his communications.
Mr. Kennedy is worried because he engages in a lot of advocacy work. "This gives them carte blanche to pry into people's personal lives. In a contentious case, the state could distort things."

Some worry that information could get into the wrong hands
By Nicole Harris
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
J 	J 	Nov. 10 Q JSprint Corp.Us wireless division said it will put global-positioning-system chips in its cell phones to locate its users, stirring up hot-button privacy concerns that the popular consumer items could become homing devices. The national wireless carrier is making the move Q starting the middle of next year Q to fulfill a federal mandate that all wireless service providers be able to pinpoint the location of a wireless 911 call within 100 feet by October 2001.	J J J J JThursday marked the deadline for the nationUs carriers to report to the Federal Communications Commission just how they would meet the mandate. Cell-phone operators can opt to install tracking software in their wireless networks, have phones include a chip with GPS technology, or a combination of the two. In a filing with the FCC, Verizon Wireless, the nationUs largest carrier, said it planned to use a network-based solution to meet the mandate.
J J J JOnce the cell-phone companies get the technology in place, a host of so-called location-based services are sure to follow. In fact, these offerings such as printed driving directions, or say, finding the closest Burger King, are at the center of the wireless industryUs next big hope: the wireless Internet. 	
J J J JBut privacy advocates warn there are too many risks that the data could wind up in the wrong hands, as well as several unanswered questions regarding how consumers will be notified about the use of the information, and how carriers will collect and store the data. While the carriers say they will be the only ones with the ability to track calls, the concern is that the information could get into the wrong hands because the tracking device will be leaving a trail of electronic footprints. 	
J J J JThat could be a particular concern for carriers that decide to go with a GPS-technology solution. That is because the FCC requires 67% of position-enabled handsets must be locatable to within 50 meters, or 55 yards, giving a more-exact location. Under controlled trial conditions earlier this year, Sprint was able to locate this percentage of test calls to less than 30 meters.
J J J J
Other experts are concerned about consumersU right to choose if they even want such location data to be generated. RThe consumer has to have some rights as to how the information is collected and how itUs used,S said David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. Mr. Sobel says he is preparing for a public session hosted by the Federal Trade Commission to be held in December on wireless location privacy issues.
J J J JStill, Oliver Valente, Sprint PCSUs chief technology officer, insists the Westwood, Kan., company will do its part to protect the privacy of its customers. He said Sprint is exploring ways to allow users to turn the 911 location-tracking device off at the push of a button, a feature that privacy experts such as Mr. Wimmer applaud.
J J J JRWe will make sure consumer information is protected,S said Mr. Valente, adding that phones with the new feature wonUt hit the market until the second half of next year.
J J J JBut Sprint already is dreaming up ways to say, offer consumer coupons to a local Pizza Hut, if the customer is in the vicinity of a restaurant. But Mr. Valente says Sprint wonUt give up the consumerUs location information to a third party. RWe could deliver the offer without the third party ever knowing where the consumer was and it would be totally opt in on the consumersU part.S

@_subject: CDR: Ruling Says Parents Have Right to See List of Sites Students Visit 
By CARL S. KAPLAN
In an opinion sure to heighten the tension between some parents and school systems over the Internet's role in publicly financed education, a New Hampshire judge has decided that a parent is entitled to see a list of the Internet sites or addresses visited by computer users at local schools.
Unless overturned on appeal, the ruling by Judge Gillian L. Abramson of Rockingham Country Superior Court means that James M. Knight of Exeter, N.H., who brought the lawsuit last summer, may review a copy of the "Internet history log" files from computers maintained by two local school districts. The computer disk files contain a record of Internet sites visited by computer users -- students, staff, faculty -- within the Exeter Region Cooperative School District and the Exeter School District.
Significantly, in an attempt to protect individual students' privacy, the court said that the schools must write a computer program that removes user names and passwords from the Internet History Log files before making the Web site lists available to Knight, which both sides agreed would be easy to do. In addition, the costs of the editing and the disk copying must be paid by Knight or any other person requesting the records, the court said.
But "since the respondents have the capacity to produce the record in a manner that does not reveal confidential information," the judge said, the history log file "is not exempt" from the state's Right-to-Know law.
Greg Kann, chairman of the Exeter Region Cooperative School Board, said in an interview that school board members would soon meet with their laywer and the superintendents to consider legal options. A decision on whether to appeal may be made as soon Friday, he said.
Jon Meyer, a lawyer in Manchester, N.H., who has experience in education law and civil rights cases, said that the New Hampshire decision is the first he is aware of involving a parent's right to gain access to school Internet records. He predicted that if Judge Abramson's ruling is not overturned, anxious parents in other states might be emboldened to use local right-to-know laws to gain access to and review school Internet history log files to check on student online activity.
Meyer also observed that one of the main issues in the Knight case was the balance between the values of privacy and disclosure. "It appears likely that the judge thought those issues could be reconciled" by editing out identifying personal information, he said.
Knight, a master plumber whose four children had attended schools in the Exeter area two years ago before transferring to private schools, has been a vocal critic of the local school boards' decision not to require filtering or blocking software on school computers. Concerned that students were visiting pornographic or other inappropriate Web sites, he sought access to Internet history log files from 1998 -- the date when a majority of local students gained online access in schools -- to the present. The lever he used was the state's Right-to-Know law, which requires public documents to be disclosed on request.
One of the key issues resolved by Judge Abramson's decision is whether history log files maintained by schools are "public records" under the disclosure law. School officials had argued in court papers that the files were private because students using school computers to access the Internet are not doing the official business of any public body. Rejecting this argument as "flawed," Judge Abramson said that students in schools are not using the computers for personal use "but as an integral part of the education curriculum." Thus the records of such official computer use must be deemed public, she asserted.
In addition, she noted that New Hampshire law requires the school districts to adopt an appropriate acceptable use policy for the Internet. When the local schools implemented those policies, the history log files were created "pursuant to law" and therefore must be considered public documents, said the court.
For his part, Knight, 44, said that he was "ecstatic" over the ruling. He said he hopes to review the school log files next week if possible.
"My request was reasonable," he said. "How else can a parent critique or decide if a site is appropriate for students unless you can get access?"
Knight also said that he had recently received e-mails from people in California, Utah, Colorado and Nevada who were interested in possibly filing their own lawsuits to get access to Internet history log files maintained by schools that do not offer filtering software. "They have the same concerns as I do," he said.
One expert in education law who has been following the case was critical of the court's ruling. Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards Association, based in Alexandria, Va., said she was concerned that the New Hampshire school officials would release private information about students' online activities.
"I don't think personally identifiable information in the Internet history log files can be easily redacted," she said. "You know, we have trained school districts not to release student files. And here they are forced to release information which they believe contains personally identifiable information on students."
Underwood noted that at a technology and learning conference in Denver two weeks ago, representatives from school districts across the country expressed concern that they might soon come under pressure to release Internet student activity files.
"Even if a school uses filtering software to block out some Web sites, the filtering software creates files, too, which may have to be released," she said. "That makes me nervous."
Michael Sims, a computer programmer and critic of filtering software in schools and libraries, agreed that filtering software creates useful log files that record Web sites visited by students and Web sites that were requested but blocked. He said if Congress eventually passes a law requiring filtering software in schools and libraries, as seems likely, he would use state right-to-know laws to obtain the log files in an attempt to challenge the law and the validity of filter programs.
"Absolutely, the precedent in New Hampshire will help us," he said.
Two years ago Sims and other activists from The Censorware Project, through an administrative process, successfully gained access to Web site tracking information contained on school computers in Utah. The group wanted to see how often students at Utah schools, which employ blocking software, were denied access to what the group deemed to be worthwhile sites.

@_subject: CDR: Tracking devices will be able to follow your every move 
Published Sunday, November 19, 2000, in the Herald-Leader Tracking devices will be able to follow your every move
By Anick Jesdanun ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK Imagine walking by a Starbucks in an unfamiliar city. Your cell phone rings, and a coupon for coffee, good only at that location, pops up on the screen.
How did your phone know you were near that particular Starbucks? What else does it know about you?
Enter location tracking, coming to a mobile device near you. Features that one day can pinpoint your whereabouts to within the length of a football field raise enormous privacy concerns, but they also offer enormous benefits.
The challenge will be determining where to draw the line.
Consider a recently unveiled technology called Digital Angel. With Digital Angel, a microchip worn close to the body promises to record a person's biological parameters and send distress signals during medical emergencies.
But misused, these types of capabilities could amount to virtual stalking.
Cell phones, hand-held devices, even car navigation systems will soon have detailed tracking abilities, if they do not already. Services could begin appearing within a year or so.
Much of the drive will come from a federal law that requires that cell phones identify callers' locations, in order to expedite 911 emergency responses. If the industry has to install expensive equipment anyway, why not use it to make money?
``There's going to be a dramatic increase in the amount of tracking that's made possible, in part by services they don't know they have,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner of the World Wide Web Consortium, which sets technical standards for the Web.
Such tracking will let someone visit a Web site and automatically get weather, movie showings or neighborhood restaurants, based on their current location. If they're lost, they will be able to ask for turn-by-turn directions. Those short of cash can be pointed to the nearest bank machine.
But if the information is stored, location tracking could result in a 24-hour-a-day record of a person's whereabouts.
So what if a divorce lawyer wants to check if someone's been cheating, or if a social service agent wants to know how many times a person has visited a candy store with their child?
``You have to ask, `Who gets how much information?''' said Jason Catlett, chief executive of Junkbusters Corp., a non-profit privacy monitoring group in Green Brook, N.J.
``Telephone records are routinely subpoenaed. They can be very intrusive, but far more intrusive is a complete log of your physical movement.''
But companies looking to gain business from location tracking insist that the worst-case scenarios presented are impractical to implement in reality.
``There's no way a database is large enough or cost effective for Starbucks to monitor everyone's location on the off chance they can acquire a customer,'' said Jason Devitt, chief executive of Vindigo, which offers 11 city guides through Palm organizers.
Lee Hancock, founder and chief executive of go2 Systems Inc., said any short-term gains from such tactics would be offset by losses if they alienate customers.
Leading wireless and advertising companies agree that they must tread carefully because mobile devices are inherently more personal than desktop computers.
At DoubleClick Inc., whose ad-targeting system generated much of the Net's privacy complaints, officials won't deliver location-based ads right away. The company wants to develop privacy standards first, using lessons from the desktop.
``We've all learned what to do and what not to do, and we can port that over to the wireless market,'' said Jamie Byrne, strategic director for emerging platforms at DoubleClick.
Any such ads will likely target a metropolitan region, rather than a city block, because audiences for block-by-block ads would be too small, Byrne said. Ultimately, he said, such targeting will help subsidize wireless services that customers want.
Jonathan Fox, director of business development at advertising company Engage Inc., says location-based profiles would not carry names and other personal information.
TRUSTe, which runs a seal-of-approval program for Internet privacy policies, is looking to develop guidelines for mobile applications.
``It's more difficult to retrofit policies if you're already down the road,'' said Robert Lewin, TRUSTe chief executive. ``Here, we have the opportunity to do it right the first time.''
In many ways, a person's whereabouts are already being tracked.
Employee security cards record when people enter buildings. Discount grocery programs track what people buy, where and when. Electronic toll-payment systems know when someone traverses a tunnel or bridge.
Current phones can pinpoint callers to a few miles by determining the location of the cell tower used to handle the call.
Palm VII organizers use similar techniques to narrow a user to a particular zip code, and an optional global-positioning receiver can pinpoint that person even further.
Marketers can also get clues from the items people search for or the sites they visit a city guide, for instance, tells in what city a person is likely located or where they plan to visit.
But for the most part, marketers have yet to take full advantage of such knowledge, and consumers have yet to complain.
``We're providing value,'' Palm spokesman Ted Ladd said. ``Mobile users are inherently in a hurry.''
Wireless providers are not likely to have a use for storing location information, except perhaps for applications that help with driving directions by determining where you came from.
Paul Reddick, vice president of product management and development with Sprint PCS, said such storage is not practical, necessary or even desirable.
``It takes years to build a brand and build trust,'' he said, ``and you can blow it pretty fast.''

@_subject: CDR: Public Demo of Carnivore and Friends 
FBI agent Marcus C. Thomas (who is mentioned in the EPIC FOIA documents)
made a very interesting presentation at NANOG 20 yesterday morning,
discussing Carnivore.
Agent Thomas gave a demonstration of both Carnivore 1.34 (the currently
deployed version) and Carnivore 2.0 (the development version) as well as
some of the other DragonWare tools.
Most of this information isn't new, but it demonstrates that the
DragonWare tools can be used to massively analyze all network traffic
accessible to a Carnivore box.
The configuration screen of Carnivore shows that protocol information can
be captured in 3 different modes: Full, Pen, and None. There are check
boxes for TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
Carnivore can be used to capture all data sent to or from a given IP
address, or range of IP addresses.
It can be used to search on information in the traffic, doing matching
against text entered in the "Data Text Strings" box. This, the agent
assured us, was so that web mail could be identified and captured, but
other browsing could be excluded.
It can be used to automatically capture telnet, pop3, and FTP logins with
the click of a check box.
It can monitor mail to and/or from specific email addresses.
It can be configured to monitor based on IP address, RADIUS username, MAC
address, or network adaptor.
IPs can be manually added to a running Carnivore session for monitoring.
Carnivore allows for monitoring of specific TCP or UDP ports and port
ranges (with drop down boxes for the most common protocols).
Carnivore 2.0 is much the same, but the configuration menu is cleaner, and
it allows Boolean statements for exclusion filter creation.
The Packeteer program takes raw network traffic dumps, reconstructs the
packets, and writes them to browsable files.
CoolMiner is the post-processor session browser. The demo was version
1.2SP4. CoolMiner has the ability to replay a victim's steps while web
browsing, chatting on ICQ, Yahoo Messenger, AIM, IRC. It can step through
telnet sessions, AOL account usage, and Netmeeting. It can display
information sent to a network printer. It can process netbios data.
CoolMiner displays summary usage, broken down by origination and
destination IP addresses, which can be selectively viewed.
Carnivore usually runs on Windows NT Workstation, but could run on Windows
Some choice quotes from Agent Thomas:
"Non-relevant data is sealed from disclosure."
"Carnivore has no active interaction with any devices on the network."
"In most cases Carnivore is only used with a Title III. The FBI will
deploy Carnivore without a warrant in cases where the victim is willing to
allow a Carnivore box to monitor his communication."
"We rely on the ISP's security [for the security of the Carnivore box]."
"We aren't concerned about the ISP's security."
When asked how Carnivore boxes were protected from attack, he said that
the only way they were accessible was through dialup or ISDN. "We could
take measures all the way up to encryption if we thought it was
While it doesn't appear that Carnivore uses a dial-back system to prevent
unauthorized access, Thomas mentioned that the FBI sometimes "uses a
firmware device to prevent unauthorized calls."
When asked to address the concerns that FBI agents could modify Carnivore
data to plant evidence, Thomas reported that Carnivore logs FBI agents'
access attempts. The FBI agent access logs for the Carnivore box become
part of the court records. When asked the question "It's often common
practice to write back doors into [software programs]. How do we know you
aren't doing that?", Thomas replied "I agree 100%. You're absolutely
When asked why the FBI would not release source, he said: "We don't sell
guns, even though we have them."
When asked: "What do you do in cases where the subject is using
encryption?" Thomas replied, "This suite of devices can't handle that." I
guess they hand it off to the NSA.
He further stated that about 10% of the FBI's Carnivore cases are thwarted
by the use of encryption, and that it is "more common to find encryption
when we seize static data, such as on hard drives."
80% of Carnivore cases have involved national security.
Also of interest was a network diagram that looked very similar to the one
in the EPIC FOIA document at
 , except
that there was no redaction of captions.

FROM DAVID LISTER IN BRUSSELS
HANDGUNS made to look like mobile phones and activated by tapping a button on the keypad are among a stockpile of deadly gadgets seized by police after being smuggled into The Netherlands from Yugoslavia. The special Arrow unit of the Dutch police disclosed yesterday that it had seized eight of the Rshooting phonesS in raids on five Amsterdam addresses during the past three weeks. It also found 29 guns disguised as key rings. Cees Rameau, a spokesman for the Amsterdam police, said that each of the mobile phones, clearly intended to be used at close range, contained four .22 calibre bullets. RFor each shot, you have to press one of the numbers on the keypad. If you didnUt know they were guns, you wouldnUt suspect anything,S he said. Although police confirmed that most of the weapons had come from Yugoslavia, they did not know for whom they were intended. Mr Rameau said that five men and one woman had been arrested, including two from Yugoslavia, one from Croatia and one from Turkey. At one address in west Amsterdam, police seized 28 key-ring guns, 26lb of explosives, a machinegun, a pistol, a revolver, 2,000 bullets and 20 hand grenades. Police also discovered 19lb of heroin, a stash of fake Dutch banknotes and blank identification papers.

@_subject: CDR: NZ: Sweeping powers for spy agencies  
29 OCTOBER 2000
Police and government spy agencies are pushing for major new surveillance powers - including the ability to intercept e-mails. In a move the Council for Civil Liberties labels a "major and disturbing intrusion" new surveillance laws are being planned which will allow police and intelligence agencies to hack covertly into home computers and intercept email and other electronic communication. Researcher and author Nicky Hager, says the proposed legislation strongly resembles the British Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act passed amid huge controversy three months ago. But he says unlike the British experience, the New Zealand legislation is being slipped through in stages, as extensions of present laws. The first is to be tabled in parliament in about 10 days. The laws were devised under the National government and can be traced back to a push by the FBI in the United States for standardised spy systems to intercept mobile phones and emails. The changes are now being promoted by Associate Justice Minister Paul Swain, and would also impose "requirements" on Internet service providers and phone companies to co-operate with intelligence agencies and police and install systems to assist spying on their customers. Hager, whose 1996 book on the global Echelon surveillance network prompted a year-long investigation by the European parliament, said the public had a right to demand proof that the new intrusive powers were so crucial that individuals had to give up privacy and freedoms. He said the way the changes were being introduced, piecemeal and in secret, was "a model of bad government". The first legislation expands the interception powers of the police and the Government Communications Security Bureau to cover all forms of electronic communications (including email, faxes and text messaging) and, for the Security Intelligence Service as well, to cover hacking into computer systems to view and copy people's files. This would be achieved by amending the Crimes Act to make it illegal to intercept emails or hack into computers - and then exempting all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies from the new law. The legislation will also increase the status of the GCSB, moving its existing powers into the Crimes Act. The other half of the plan is changes to the Telecommunications Act, requiring telephone companies to make systems "interceptable". Hager says New Zealand officials secretly agreed to implement the surveillance changes after attending a meeting at the FBI headquarters in Quantico, south of Washington DC, in 1993. Swain says the driving force of the law changes is the wish to protect privacy because there is no legislation to say "wandering into someone's internal communications system is illegal". The exemptions for the government agencies came later, he said.

@_subject: CDR: Copyright Office Backs Digital Law 
By AMY HARMON
In a decision giving copyright holders greater control over the way people use books, movies and music that are distributed in digital form, the United States Copyright Office on Friday endorsed a new federal law making it illegal to break the technological safeguards for such works. The statute goes into effect immediately.
The ruling was a defeat for several constituencies � including universities, libraries and computer programmers � that had argued that the law should preserve traditional rights to archive and lend out copyrighted material or to use so-called reverse-engineering to understand how a piece of technology works.
The provision endorsed by the copyright office is part of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Congress passed the act to update the copyright law for the digital era, when copying on a mass scale is far easier than it has ever been. Under the act, it is illegal to create or distribute a device like a computer program that can crack the copy- protection security code on an electronic book or a DVD movie disc.
This year, a federal judge found that the Web site of 2600 magazine, whose publisher is Eric Corley, had violated the law by distributing a program designed to break the security code on DVD's so that they could be played on computers running the Linux software operating system.
But when the judge issued the ruling, the law did not prohibit the actual use of such a device by individuals because of the pending review by the copyright office. Congress had asked the copyright office to determine whether any exemptions were necessary to ensure that the rights of the users of copyrighted works were balanced with those of copyright holders.
Media companies including Sony and Time Warner had argued that the statute was necessary to protect their digital material, like computer games and movies, from widespread unauthorized use. But groups like the Association of American Universities, the American Library Association and the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration maintained that broad exemptions were necessary to preserve the "fair use" rights of individuals. After holding several hearings and receiving comments for almost two years, the copyright office said repeatedly in its ruling that the proponents of various kinds of exemptions had not demonstrated evidence that there would be "substantial harm" if an exemption was not granted.
The ruling, issued by the Library of Congress, which oversees the copyright office, will be in effect for three years, during which the copyright office will continue to examine its effect.
In a statement, the Library of Congress said that it intended to ask Congress to reconsider that time frame, noting the "potential damage to scholarship may well ensue in the course of a three-year period."
Under the law, civil statutory damages for gaining access to a piece of copyrighted material secured by computer code range from $200 to $2,500. Criminal penalties includes fines of as much as $1 million or 10 years in jail for repeat offenses.

@_subject: CDR: Federal agencies share taxpayer info from Web sites 
By LANCE GAY
Scripps Howard News Service
September 07, 2000
WASHINGTON - At least four federal agencies are sharing taxpayer data they are gathering from Internet visitors to government Web sites with trade organizations, retailers or other outside parties, congressional investigators say.
In a survey of online-privacy protections at government-run Web sites, the General Accounting Office found that 23 of 70 agencies surveyed have disclosed personal information gathered from Web sites to third parties, mostly other government agencies. But at least four agencies were found sharing information with private entities.
The GAO is a congressional unit that audits federal programs.
Some privacy advocates said the findings show the need to update a 1974 Privacy Act, which forbids government agencies from sharing with outsiders information they collect from taxpayers, but was drafted before computers were widely used.
"It's time to strengthen this important law for the Internet age,'' said Ari Schwartz, policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology.
Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the report clearly shows the White House isn't effectively enforcing Privacy Act provisions on executive branch agencies. "It's a surprisingly good law,'' Rotenberg said. "I think the big issue here is oversight and enforcement of the Privacy Act."
The GAO investigation was launched a year ago on a request by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., to find out how government agencies are handling privacy issues on their Web sites. Lieberman has spearheaded efforts on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee to oversee government use of the Internet to provide information to taxpayers.
GAO investigators said many of the privacy problems with government Web sites they uncovered could be addressed by the White House Office of Management and Budget issuing more specific guidelines on what information government agencies can release.
Office of Management and Budget guidelines forbid dissemination of "substantial" personal information, but they don't tell agencies what that means, or "whether such information as Social Security numbers and credit card numbers qualify as substantial personal information," the GAO said.
In its survey of 70 government agencies, congressional investigators classified "substantial" personal information as being a person's name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, Social Security number or credit card numbers. The investigation found 23 agencies shared information with other government agencies, and four said they share information with private-sector entities.
The agencies were not named. The outside parties included trade organizations, bilateral development banks, product manufacturers, distributors and retailers.
Sally Katzen, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the GAO report didn't reflect considerable progress the Clinton administration has made in persuading government agencies to pay attention to privacy issues.
Web sites run by the White House itself have been embroiled in privacy concerns. In June, Scripps Howard News Service reported that Internet sites run by the White House drug czar's office were secretly putting "cookie" programs in the computers of visitors to track what they were doing on the site.
Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew ordered drug czar Barry McCaffrey to turn off the cookie machine, and issued a governmentwide directive stating that cookies programs can only be used in rare cases, and only if their use is approved by the agency's director.
The GAO survey found seven agencies used cookies, which are small software programs inserted in a visitor's computer. Cookies programs are used by advertising firms to track Internet users' activities, and can be combined with other data to compile profiles of individual Internet users.

Russian law lets agency monitor e-mails, Net traffic and cell-phone conversations without users' consent
BY MARGARET COKER
Cox News Service MOSCOW -- For Russian computer users, the message ``You've Got Mail!'' might now well read, ``You've Got Company.''
Under a far-reaching new law going into effect this month, Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, is allowed to snoop on all Internet traffic and eavesdrop on cellular telephone and pager communications -- all without the user's consent or knowledge.
Russia's flourishing Internet service providers, or ISPs, say the government's demand that they install the eavesdropping equipment and train intelligence officers to use it will put the fledgling companies out of business.
Meanwhile, civil rights groups say the surveillance measures, known by their Russian acronym SORM, are yet another sign of a return to Soviet-style political repression under current President Vladimir Putin.
``This is the end to all e-mail privacy,'' said Anatoly Levanchuk, an Internet and free-speech advocate. ``Wiretapping is now only a click away.''
The Draconian regulations were first issued by government decree in 1995. At this time, they only covered wiretapping telephone calls. SORM was updated in 1998 to include Internet technologies -- the venue where, Russian officials believe, most crime in the 21st century will be committed. The Justice Ministry approved the measures on July 25, effectively making them law.
The amended directives require all Russian ISPs to equip their networks with an FSB monitor and connect them with a high-speed fiber-optic link to FSB headquarters. The link permits the agency to keep an eye on electronic transmissions -- from private e-mails to e-commerce purchases -- in real-time and in total privacy. Failure to put in the bugging devices, which the Internet firms say cost between $15,000 and $25,000, will mean the loss of the service provider's operating license.
Alexei Rokotyan, a top official in Russia's Communications Ministry, admits that the regulations -- the Orwellian-termed ``System of Operational and Investigative Measures'' -- give the government access to all information transmitted via Russian ISPs.
``Security organs and special forces have the right, and now the capability, to monitor private correspondence and telephone conversations of individual citizens in the name of establishing legal order,'' Rokotyan told Russian television in July. He insisted, though, that SORM would be used only for ``monitoring individual cases according to the law.''
Internet surveillance has come under fire in many countries, including the United States. In 1994, U.S. lawmakers authorized the FBI to wiretap and eavesdrop on criminals conducting or discussing crimes over the Internet. The measure was vehemently opposed, with only limited success, in 1998 by civil liberties groups and telecom businesses who viewed it as a threat to both profits and personal freedom.
Human rights advocates in Russia say these same issues that aroused opposition in the United States are magnified here because there are virtually no checks-and-balances to prevent the FSB from using their expansive powers to cross from law enforcement into political blackmail and commercial espionage.
``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says Internet (service) providers must render assistance in a criminal case. But free access to the Internet gives the FSB great power that would be easy to abuse,'' said Ina Zemskova, a lawyer with the St. Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group. ``In our country, no one monitors the eavesdroppers.''
Legal experts say the SORM regulations are fraught with loopholes that allow the FSB to sidestep the required warrant before conducting any electronic surveillance. That leaves telecommunications firms in the dark.
``We do not know exactly what the FSB does in our network. We cannot see what they are doing, when they are tapping in. We can only trust that they are not working against our clients' interests,'' said Mikhail Yakushev, the head of the legal department at GlobalOne, a multinational telecommunications company.
About 7 million people, or 4.8 percent of Russia's 145 million population, are connected to the Internet. That number is expected to rise to 8 percent of the population in the next three years, according to Avi Krel, the telecom analyst at UFG investment bank in Moscow.
Although minuscule compared to the United States, this activity has generated 2,000 Internet start-ups in the last two years. More than 300 businesses are licensed to provide Internet service here, and some 20,000 Russian Web sites offer search engines, chatrooms and e-commerce outlets. Economists estimate Russia's dot-com economy's annual turnover at $100 million.
So far, the Internet has offered Russians much more than monetary gain. The information superhighway has spurred the growth of environmental organizations, academics and a rising number of government critics by connecting them across Russia's 11 time zones that extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Polish border.
In many cases, the most outspoken opponents of government policy are chatroom monitors or network operators themselves. They were among the first to sound the alarm about SORM, leaving the traditional media in their wake as they posted up-to-the-minute news about the progress of the proposed regulations.
Oleg Syrov, the director of an ISP based in the northern Russian town of Volgograd, has become one of SORM's most vocal critics. After denying the FSB access to his Bayara-Slavia Communications network in 1998, Syrov said he received anonymous death threats. He said he has also fought off multiple attempts by the FSB to shut down his business.
An FSB spokesman contacted about the allegations raised refused to comment for this story,
But around the rest of the marketplace, opposition to the regulations among ISPs has weakened as the government's determination to institute the surveillance measures have strengthened.
While the Communications Ministry said the vast majority of Internet providers are complying with SORM, all but one of the six Moscow-based ISPs contacted for this story refused to say whether they had installed the eavesdropping equipment. The exception -- GlobalOne -- said all of its hardware and software contained the equipment necessary for the FSB to dial in.
``The resistance movement is as good as dead,'' said a grim Alexander Levanchuk, the founder of  a Russian political Web site, and one of the people spearheading a legal challenge to SORM. ``The FSB can outmuscle us, and it usually wins these things.''

By JOHN SCHWARTZ
QUANTICO, Va. -- AS long as there have been law enforcement agents, they have tried to listen in on what the bad guys are planning. In early times, that meant standing next to a window in the evesdrope, the place where water from the eaves drips, to overhear conversations. As communications went electronic, eavesdropping did, too: Gen. Jeb Stuart hired a tapper to intercept telegraph messages in the Civil War. And by the 1890's, two decades after Alexander Graham Bell's first call to Watson, the first known telephone wiretaps by the police were in place. The Internet, in turn, has provided new frontiers for law enforcement tappers. At first, surveillance of Internet traffic was useful only in hacking cases Q after all, only geeks were online. But as the world has gone digital, criminals have as well, and Internet taps are requested in a growing number of cases. According to documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group based in Washington, requests from field offices for help with "data interception operations" rose more than 18-fold between fiscal years 1997 and 1999. In Congressional testimony in July, the assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's laboratory division, Donald M. Kerr, painted a stark portrait of the dangers of the online world. "The use of computers and the Internet is growing rapidly, paralleled by exploitation of computers, networks and databases to commit crimes and to harm the safety, security and privacy of others," he said. All manner of crimes Q child pornography, fraud, identity theft, even terrorism Q are being perpetrated using the Internet as a tool, he said. But one device developed by the F.B.I. to deal with this new world of crime has drawn it squarely into a debate over the proper limits of government surveillance: an Internet wiretapping system called Carnivore. The Carnivore effort, which came to light last June, met with resistance from groups as diverse as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives.
The F.B.I. says it has already used the device in dozens of investigations. But critics are concerned that Carnivore, much more than telephone wiretaps, can cast an investigative net that captures the communications of bystanders along with those of a suspect.
The House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, has said the technology raises "strong concerns" that the government "is infringing on Americans' basic constitutional protection against unwarranted search and seizure."
"Until these concerns are addressed," he said, "Carnivore should be shut down."
The name, to be sure, has not helped the F.B.I.'s salesmanship. It was derived from an earlier system, called Omnivore, that captured most of the Internet traffic coursing through a network. "As the tool developed and became more discerning" Q able to get at the meat of an investigation Q "it was named Carnivore," an official said. ("If they called it Device 374," he explained, "nobody could remember what Device 374 is.") The F.B.I. says the real value of Carnivore, by any name, is that it can do much less than its predecessors. It says agents can fine-tune the system to yield only the sources and recipients of the suspect's e- mail traffic, providing Internet versions of the phone-tapping tools that record the numbers dialed by a suspect and the numbers of those calling in. Those tools, known respectively as pen registers and "trap and trace" devices, are valuable building blocks of any preliminary investigation. "Trap and trace is vital," said Marcus C. Thomas, who heads the bureau's cybertechnology section, "to try to understand criminal organizations, who's communicating with who." Moreover, a full federal wiretap Q whether of a suspect's phone or of Internet traffic Q requires extensive evidence of criminal activity and approval from high Justice Department officials and a judge. Court approval to monitor the origins and destinations, not the content, requires only a pledge from the investigators that the information would be relevant. Law enforcement officials say the goal of Carnivore is to protect privacy. Under most wiretaps, they reason, investigators have to review all the material that comes in over the wire and discard any material that they are not entitled to review under the terms of the warrant Q say, a conversation with the suspect's grandmother. Because the path of online data is harder to isolate than a telephone line, Carnivore may capture communications unrelated to the suspect. But because it then filters out whatever investigators are not entitled to see, officials say, privacy is enhanced.
To understand why the F.B.I. hungers for Carnivore, behold its ancestor: a hulking stainless steel box the size of an old Kelvinator in the building in Quantico where the bureau designs what it calls interception systems. The $80,000 behemoth can monitor data traffic on three phone lines simultaneously and translate the squeal of modems into the e-mail and Web pages that a criminal suspect sees. But it can monitor only a standard modem. If a criminal suspect has, like millions of other Americans, decided to trade up to high-speed Internet access through a cable modem or the telephone service known as D.S.L., "it's worthless," Mr. Thomas said.
In contrast to that middle-tech dinosaur, Carnivore is a sleek and speedy mammal, a black box of a PC built to work with the vast amounts of high-speed data that course through the Internet. The machine can tap communications for almost all of the ways that people get online. It costs a tenth of what the bureau pays for each of the older machines, and it can do far more: it can sift through all the communications of an Internet service provider, perhaps including tens of thousands of users, and pull out the e-mail and Web travels of the suspect. And although doing so would raise deep constitutional issues, the system can even be programmed to monitor the use of particular words and phrases used in messages by anyone on the network.
When law enforcement agents get permission to install Carnivore, they send their own technicians to the office of an Internet service provider. The system itself, once programmed with the details of a search, can easily be installed on the same racks that the company uses for its own network equipment, and is tied in to the flow of data. For all its power, however, Carnivore cannot digest all that it eats: if law enforcement officials intercept a message that has been encrypted, they will get a featureless fuzz of ones and zeroes.
The furor over the technology caught the F.B.I. by surprise. "What would you have us do?" Mr. Thomas asked in frustration. "Stop enforcing laws because it's on the Internet?" Paul Bresson, an F.B.I. spokesman, added, "The public should be concerned about the criminals out there abusing this stuff, and not the good guys." The two men discussed the system in Mr. Thomas's office at the bureau's research center at Quantico, home of the F.B.I. training academy. From the outside, the center is so unremarkable that it could be a college classroom building in a witness-protection program. But the array of dishes and antennas along the roofline suggest that something more interesting is going on inside. This is where three F.B.I. engineers took pieces of commercial software and modified them in an effort to allow the kind of selective data retrieval that the law requires, and where they have worked to upgrade the system in response to the criticism of Carnivore. The engineers have added auditing features, for example, that the bureau says will help insure that investigators will not tamper with the system or try to gather more information than authorized. But the F.B.I. is not depending on Carnivore alone for the future of online surveillance. According to budget documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center under a Freedom of Information Act request, the bureau's plans include developing ways to listen in on the growing medium of voice telephone calls conducted over the Internet and to monitor the live online discussion system known as Internet Relay Chat, as well as other network technologies that were identified in the original document but were blacked out in the copies provided to the group.
Some alternatives are already in use, including one that reportedly figured in an investigation of Nicodemo S. Scarfo Jr., an accused bookmaker whose imprisoned father is the former head of the Philadelphia crime organization. In 1999, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported recently, agents planted a tap in Mr. Scarfo's computer keyboard that stored everything the suspect typed Q including the password for the encryption software used to protect files on his hard drive. Mr. Thomas was unwilling to discuss new techology methods in detail, but said he knew of only two cases in which such devices had been used. A former federal prosecutor, Mark Rasch, says still more methods of Internet wiretap could be on the way. Mr. Rasch, vice president for cyberlaw at Predictive Systems, an Internet consulting company, noted that hacker groups had developed malicious computer programs with names like Back Orifice 2000 that when planted in a target computer give full remote access of the target machine to the hacker. Mr. Rasch suggested that such remote-control programs could reduce the risk of break-ins for the agency and might already be in use.
"I would be shocked," he said, if such software were not being used in intelligence investigations, which provide government agents with more leeway than in criminal investigations of American citizens.
But Marc J. Zwillinger, a former Justice Department lawyer, said law enforcement agents were unlikely to take such a risky course, because "it would be difficult to control, and if it did get out of control, there would be a backlash against the agency." In the meantime, as the Congressional debate over Carnivore continues, the future of the system is uncertain. [The new attorney general, John Ashcroft, has not addressed Carnivore directly, but he has taken a tough stand in the past against what he sees as high-tech government intrusions into privacy.] Members of Congress and civil libertarians argue that the analogies to telephone taps are flawed and that the Carnivore technology violates constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.
"The whole controversy is over intercepting thousands of conversations simultaneously," regardless of the filtering then applied, said Richard Diamond, a spokesman for Mr. Armey, the House majority leader. Some critics have suggested imposing the same strict authorization rules on Carnivore that prevail for full-scale telephone wiretaps, with stiff penalties for any abuse of the system. Still, many of those who oppose Carnivore have concluded that it is here to stay. "You can't outlaw this technology," said James X. Dempsey, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a high-tech policy group in Washington. "All you can do is set strict legal standards."

@_subject: The Key Vanishes: Scientist Outlines Unbreakable Code 
By GINA KOLATA
A computer science professor at Harvard says he has found a way to send coded messages that cannot be deciphered, even by an all-powerful adversary with unlimited computing power. And, he says, he can prove it.
If he is right, and he does have some supporters, his code may be the first that is both practical and provably secure. While there are commercially available coding systems that seem very hard to break, no one can prove that they cannot be cracked, mathematicians say.
In essence, the researcher, Dr. Michael Rabin and his Ph.D. student Yan Zong Bing, have discovered a way to make a code based on a key that vanishes even as it is used. While they are not the first to have thought of such an idea, Dr. Rabin says that never before has anyone been able to make it both workable and to prove mathematically that the code cannot be broken.
"This is the first provably unbreakable code that is really efficient," Dr. Rabin said. "We have proved that the adversary is helpless."
Dr. Richard Lipton, a computer science professor at Princeton, who is visiting this year at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said, "It's like in the old `Mission Impossible,' where the message blows up and disappears."
Someone who uses one of today's commercially available coding systems, Dr. Lipton explained, uses the same key Q mathematical formulas for encoding and decoding Q over and over. Eventually, they may be forced, perhaps by a court order, to give up the key. Or the key may be stolen. But with Dr. Rabin's system, the message stays secret forever because the code uses a stream of random numbers that are plugged into the key for encoding and decoding. The numbers are never stored in a computer's memory, so they essentially vanish as the message is being encrypted and decrypted.
"If someone walks into my office with a court order or if they put a gun to my head they still could not read my conversations," Dr. Lipton said. In a sense, say some mathematicians and computer scientists, Dr. Rabin may have solved the ultimate problem in cryptography, one that has driven research for centuries: finding a provably unbreakable code that is also practical. But, they say, the paradox is that the discovery has come at a time of vigorous debate over whether such a code will make much difference in keeping communications private.
Some say that a provably unbreakable code could have profound effects, keeping secret messages secret forever. But others say that codes today are already so good that there is little to be gained by making them provably, rather than just probably, unbreakable.
For now, Dr. Rabin's idea is simply a scheme backed up by a mathematical proof that he has been presenting to scientists at seminars. No company is lurking in the background to sell it, and Dr. Rabin says he has no commercial interests in it.
"I never commercialize anything," Dr. Rabin said. "I am not in that business." Instead, he said, he did the work because it was a challenge.
Dr. Rabin's idea is simplicity itself, at least in the world of encryption. Previous coding methods rely for their security on the limitations of computing power. They assume that if breaking a code requires enough calculations, even the best computers will not be able to do it.
But, Dr. Rabin said, there is no proof that such codes are secure. Their security hinges on the belief that no one will find a shortcut to doing the calculations. It is always possible that such a shortcut exists, waiting to be discovered by a clever mathematician.
Dr. Rabin relies instead on the limits of memory banks in computers. No matter how powerful a computer is, no computer can store an unlimited amount of data. And yet that is what is required for an eavesdropper to break his code.
The coding starts with a continuously generated string of random numbers, say from a satellite put up to broadcast them or from some other source. The numbers can be coming by at an enormous speed Q 10 million million per second, for example.
The sender of a message and its recipient agree to start plucking a sequence of numbers from that string. They may agree, for example, to send a message, encoded with any of today's publicly available encryption systems saying "start" and giving instructions on capturing certain of the random numbers. As they capture the numbers, the sender uses them to encode a message, and the recipient uses the numbers to decode it.
An eavesdropper can know the mathematical formula used to encode and decode, but without knowing the exact sequence of random numbers that were used in the formula to send a particular message, the eavesdropper cannot decode the message. And the only way to have that sequence is to just happen to be storing numbers from the unending stream at exactly the right moment.
If the eavesdropper, for example, had a secret way to decode the message saying "start" and it took a minute to do the calculation needed to decode it, it would be too late by the time the eavesdropper got going. The sender and recipient would already have their string of numbers and that string of numbers, once broadcast, could never be retrieved. It would be infeasible to store the endless string of numbers in any computer and so they are essentially gone forever.
Often, Dr. Rabin said, eavesdroppers will capture and store encoded messages hoping to decode them at later, either when computers have improved Q making it easier to do the calculations to break a code Q or when the method for encoding and decoding is known, perhaps because it has been stolen. But, he said, messages encoded with his system can never be broken by these means because the random numbers used in encoding and decoding are used once and are never stored.
"That is why I call it `everlasting security,' " he said. Dr. Richard DeMillo, chief technology officer at Hewlett-Packard, said that what interested him about the scheme was that it "reshuffles the policy deck."
"Normally," he explained, "agencies put the burden of wiretapping on the carrier." A telephone company, for example, would have to allow an agency like the Federal Bureau of Investigation to listen in on coded material. But with this system, the agency would still have the burden of trying to capture the appropriate stream of random numbers, a task that would be technologically infeasible.
Dr. Lipton also said the scheme could thwart law enforcement agencies.
"If I'm saying to you, `Buy 1,000 shares of I.B.M., I'm sure it's going to go up,' " he said, "and if that was an insider trading situation, five years from now the F.B.I. could go after you."
If the agency had the encrypted message in hand, it could demand the key to read it, he said. But, Dr. Lipton said, if the random numbers used to encode were used once and never stored, the agency would be hamstrung. "It changes the ground rules," he said.
Dr. Lipton added that, as a computer scientist, he appreciated the proof that the code could not be broken. "Michael's big contribution has been the proof that the system actually works," he said. "It's one of those things that sounds obvious but the mathematics is quite hard."
Of course, what is good for those who want privacy may not be good for law enforcement. Even the cryptography systems sold today are a problem for the F.B.I. "Uncrackable encryption allows drug lords, terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their criminal intentions without fear of outside intrusion," the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, told the Senate in 1998, according to a transcript from the Federal Document Clearing House. "This type of encryption also allows these same people to maintain electronically stored evidence of their crimes beyond the reach of law enforcement."
Still, some computer experts said that while it might be interesting in theory to have a provably unbreakable code, the practical importance of Dr. Rabin's code may be minimal.
Some, like Dr. Dorothy Denning, a computer science professor at Georgetown, and Dr. Cipher Deavours, a professor of computer science and mathematics at Kean University in Union, N.J., said the code was simply impractical for large messages. The larger the message, the longer the string of random numbers needed to encode it, and the more difficult it would be to send.
"It's a cute idea, but it's simply unmanageable," Dr. Deavours said.
Others, like Dr. Lipton, disagreed. "I think it is quite practical," he said. And Dr. Rabin insisted that computers would have no problem with the encryption scheme, even with long messages that were sent among a large group of people.
Beyond the question of whether the system would work in practice, some question it because, they say, the role of cryptography in protecting privacy has been overblown.
"If you think cryptography is the answer to your problem, then you don't know what your problem is," said Dr. Peter G. Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif.
Dr. Neumann explained that there are always ways to get around cryptography barriers and that these methods have nothing to do with breaking codes. "It's like the voting machines," he said. "You'd like to have some integrity in the electoral process and now folks are coming out of the woodwork saying, `We have this perfect algorithm for privacy and security.' "
But, he said, while the systems may use cryptography to make sure that when someone touches a screen to vote, that vote is transmitted with perfect security, who's to ensure the integrity of the person who programs the computer?
"There is no guarantee that your vote actually goes into the computer the way it looks on the touch screen," Dr. Neumann said. "What does it take to buy a computer programmer? A couple of years' salary and a house in the Cayman Islands?"
Bruce Schneier, who is founder and chief technical officer for Counterpane Internet Security in San Jose, said that, as a scientist, he liked the idea of a provably secure system. "Research like this should be encouraged," he said. "But research is different from engineering."
But in the real world, a burglar confronted by an impenetrable lock on the front door may well go round to the back and just smash a window. "I'm a cryptographer by trade," Mr. Schneier said. "And a provably secure cryptosystem doesn't do me any good. We're putting a stake in the ground and hoping the enemy runs into it and now we're arguing about whether it should be one mile tall or two miles tall. It doesn't matter. The enemy will walk around it," he added.
Dr. Robert Morris, a retired cryptographer who was chief scientist for the National Security Agency, the nation's code-making and code- breaking agency, also questioned the primacy of cryptography.
"As far as I can see, he seems to be correct Q it's a provably secure method," Dr. Morris said. "But does that mean no one can read it? Nah."
He explained: "You can still get the message, but maybe not by cryptanalysis. If you're in this business, you go after a reasonably cheap, reliable method. It may be one of the three B's: burglary, bribery or blackmail. Those are right up there along with cryptanalysis in their importance."
Dr. Rabin said that just because there are other weaknesses in communications systems, that did not mean that secure encryption was not important.
It is as though medical researchers started arguing that there is no need to find a cure for AIDS, Dr. Rabin said. After all, many more people die of heart disease, and if you cure people of AIDS, heart disease can still strike them.
"This is not a reason not to work on H.I.V.," Dr. Rabin said. "The problem of H.I.V. is still important."
Dr. Morris said that even though the actual breaking of codes might not be necessary to read encrypted messages, Dr. Rabin's method could have an effect. "In a sense, what it does is shift the emphasis from cryptanalysis to some other sort of attack," he said.

@_subject: Web sites feed boom in sex trade and slavery  
Published Wednesday, Jan. 3, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY KEVIN G. HALL Mercury News Rio de Janeiro Bureau RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- At Agencia Roberta, a call-girl service in this tourist haven known for sun and sin, business is booming, thanks in large part to the Internet.
Italians, Germans, Americans and other foreigners can make arrangements for services in advance, even before their planes touch down. The oldest profession in the world is getting a boost from the newest technology.
``It's globalization,'' explains Vanessa, a manager of the online escort service that charges men about $150 for three hours of pleasure.
``Everybody has a Web page. All the prostitutes know about this,'' says Betty, a freelance hooker in Rio who speaks over a rattling television and the laughter of children. She advertises her Web site in the Brazilian newspaper O Globo.
The Internet gained early fame as a tool to arrange consensual sex via chat rooms. But it also has a more sinister function. It has become a tool that aids the exploitation of women who are tricked or forced into prostitution around the world. Digital cameras mean these women find themselves performing sex acts for voyeurs across the globe. With a few clicks of a computer mouse, a man can log on anywhere from suburban Maryland to rural Montana and be transported instantly to a bedroom in Thailand or the Ukraine.
``People can get so selective that they can now see a particular type of woman doing a type of act, and can do that from a global connection out of sight. Over time, it will increase the demand for real sex slaves,'' warned J. Robert Flores, vice president of the National Law Center for Children and Families in Fairfax, Va., and a former high-ranking official in the Department of Justice's obscenity and child-exploitation division.
Law enforcement officials have known that women are often held against their will and forced into sex at Asian brothels or those controlled by the Russian mob, even in the United States. But now there is a new twist: The act can be sold around the world, Flores said.
``The Internet has made the sex market even stronger, and has even made it possible to market women around the world,'' said Flores, who says few Web sites are actually so bold as to advertise sex slaves.
In Brazil, prostitutes have become prime targets for global sex syndicates, who lure them to foreign countries and then enslave them, said Carla Dolinski, a police investigator who leads anti-trafficking efforts in Rio. An estimated 75,000 Brazilian women work in Europe as prostitutes, many against their will. Dolinski said police recently received a complaint about a widely circulated e-mail trying to recruit Brazilian prostitutes for work in Spain. And there are well-documented cases of ordinary women being tricked into traveling abroad for work, only to be forced into prostitution.
One of them is 20-year-old Beatriz, an ebony-skinned woman with a cover-girl smile. She left her home on the rough outskirts of Rio de Janeiro for the tourist island of Lanzarote, near the Canary Islands. She said she thought she would be part of a Brazilian dance troupe, but she ended up enslaved in Lanzarote, forced to perform sex acts for Spaniards and other tourists -- without pay -- until she managed to escape.
Another Brazilian woman, who asked to be called Ana, said she was lured to Tel Aviv, Israel, two years ago believing she'd be a high-paid waitress. After she arrived, her documents were confiscated and she was told the icy truth: She was now an unpaid prostitute at the service of the Russian mob. She was put to work the very afternoon she arrived. Like Beatriz, she escaped. Her captors murdered one of her friends for not cooperating.
Beatriz and Ana did not find out about their ``jobs'' through high-tech means, but Dolinksi fears that e-mail and Internet sites will more easily entice other desperate women to travel across the globe for promises of a better life, only to suffer similar fates.
``If a foreigner has a site offering $1,000 a month, the girls will go. It is difficult to investigate when it comes from outside of Brazil,'' Dolinski said.
Authorities are still trying to document the myriad ways the Internet is involved in sex trafficking, but sites that are little more than marketing tools for traffickers are proliferating.
One Web site, for example, features private chat rooms for men who may or may not be aware of the misery they are supporting. They exchange tips on brothels around the world where authorities say many women are virtual slaves.
``Almost all the girls have babies, but still, they are good!!! If you like the young, but legal, baby-faced Lolitas, you cannot get it any cheaper,'' says one man's posting on the site about his trip to Brazil.
Another site notes that sex with Brazilian minors is illegal. Even so, it suggests that if ``you are under 50 and white, or even better, blond and blue-eyed, try flirting with any girl from 16 years up, in the street, near high schools.''
The site notes that the Brazilian government has cracked down on child prostitution, but it appears to justify sex with minors by noting ``they will either return home and get abused or roam the street penniless eating at garbage dumps.''
The Internet appears to offer countless ways to deceive and promote illegal activities. Flores points out that many sites offer to help find a marriage partner. But, he adds: ``If you go to those sites, the vast majority of them offer nude pictures of these women. The reality is that after you have been on the site for a few minutes, what you really are talking about is buying and selling of women,'' which is against the law.
A Miami-based Internet site claims to be a matchmaking service, by offering ``mail-order brides'' and charging fees to introduce men to foreign women.
The site, which features photos of women along with information about them, tells cybersurfers not to let worries about their own looks or a lack of money deter them from trying to contact women on the sites.
``If you make only $800 a month you will still be making many times more than the average Cuban worker,'' the site says.
A site from Rugby, N.D., called Your Destiny advertises a buyers' market since, it says, there ``is an overabundance of young single women in Russia.''
Authorities are worried about these subtler approaches. Some are legitimate matchmaking services, but experts think many are a ruse for trafficking women into the United States.
The Justice Department estimates that 50,000 to 100,000 women and children have been trafficked into the United States in the past few years. Lawmakers are considering legislation to grant special visas to women tricked into slavery who are willing to testify against their captors.
There are no statistics on how the Internet's mail-order bride-sites have abetted trafficking, but experts believe they have and that traffickers will become even more sophisticated in using the Internet to reap profits from their trade.
At the same time, anti-trafficking activists in Brazil and around the world say they will try to fight back with the very same tool -- tapping the Internet to warn women about sex slavery.
Cristina Leonardo, a human rights attorney in Brazil, is trying to set up a Web site dedicated to providing information about known traffickers. Her ``Project Against the Trafficking of Humans'' would create a national and international telephone center where people provide tips to authorities. Through her Brazilian Defense Center, Leonardo also is trying to create online training programs, so police and the courts can share information around the world to better protect women from this modern-day scourge.

@_subject: Clinton Creates Post to Protect Nation's Secrets  
By JAMES RISEN
ASHINGTON, Jan. 4 � President Clinton has issued an order reorganizing the government's counterintelligence efforts, creating a new czar with a broad mandate to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities, administration officials said today. The directive, signed in the waning days of Mr. Clinton's administration, creates a National Counterintelligence Executive charged with bringing a forward-looking, post-cold-war mentality to counterintelligence. Officials say the post is designed as the counterintelligence equivalent to the nation's drug czar. The executive's central task will be to try to determine which secrets held by the government or the private sector are so valuable that they need to be protected from the nation's adversaries. The czar will also try to assess which secrets are of special interest to other nations, and then bring together the F.B.I., C.I.A. and other agencies to determine whether those countries are making efforts to obtain them. A spokesman for the Bush transition team referred all questions about the plan to the White House and declined to say whether transition officials had been consulted. Once in office, Mr. Bush could decide to change the plan without Congressional approval. But the reorganization and the newly created post have the strong backing of F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh, who is staying in his post into the Bush administration, and Central Intelligence Director George J. Tenet, whose tenure also may overlap. Administration officials and others familiar with the plan say that the czar will not be in charge of managing individual spy cases and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will retain its lead role in counterespionage investigations. The C.I.A. will also retain its own counterintelligence center, which conducts investigations within the agency. But officials said that the new office of the counterintelligence executive would replace the existing National Counterintelligence Center, which was created after the 1994 arrest of Aldrich Ames, the C.I.A. officer who pleaded guilty to spying for Moscow for nine years. On paper, the existing agency also had a broad mandate to coordinate government efforts to identify counterintelligence threats, but several officials said that it had failed to live up to that role. Some critics in the government say that the counterintelligence center never had the stature or influence to command cooperation between government agencies. The Clinton administration may name a counterintelligence czar before the president leaves office, officials said today. Although it unclear whether the administration had consulted the transition team, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the leading Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has been generally supportive of the reorganization effort, a Shelby aide said. The counterintelligence overhaul comes in the wake of the furor over the government's handling of the case of Wen Ho Lee, the scientist fired from his job at Los Alamos National Laboratory and charged with mishandling classified information. Although he pleaded guilty to one count related to downloading and copying nuclear data from Los Alamos, other charges were dropped. Officials say that Mr. Freeh advocated the reorganization in response to the flaws in the way that case was handled. "This should solve a lot of the shortcomings we have in the present environment," said one senior law enforcement official. Officials say that the key to the reorganization will be that the leading counterintelligence official in the government would no longer be simply responding to an investigation of an individual spy case, but would rather be focused on broad efforts to determine what secrets might be most tantalizing to other countries. Those secrets could be at the Pentagon or at a high-tech corporation, and the czar will be able to go to the F.B.I., C.I.A. and other agencies and begin to develop plans to make sure those secrets are secure before any spies have gotten to them. The czar's job will be to "identify the universe of stuff that it would be unthinkable if we lost," one official said. "This job is to figure out what must be protected. The person in this job, I would think, would spend the first year going around to everybody in the government and business asking what people believe we absolutely have to protect, and then coming up with a judgment about what really are the nation's crown jewels, as opposed to just costume jewelry. Part of the disconnect we have today in the government is that we don't even know what it is that it's unthinkable for us to lose as a nation." The reorganization plan has support among intelligence policy experts on Capitol Hill, many of whom say the government is usually on the defensive, simply reacting to the latest spy case. The government has "been spending an inordinate amount of time looking in the rear view mirror," said Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat and member of the Senate intelligence committee who has been pushing for a counterintelligence reorganization. As a result, "we didn't look to see what was coming at us in the future."
Several officials acknowledged that it was still too early to determine whether the czar will have the clout to manage such a sweeping change in the way counterintelligence is managed. That clout will be largely determined by the executive's relations with his office's four- member board, composed of the F.B.I. director, the deputy director of Central Intelligence, the deputy secretary of defense, and a representative of the Attorney General. The czar will also report directly to the deputies committee at the National Security Council and will have access to all secrets related to counterintelligence cases, officials said. The power of the czar "is going to depend on who they put in the job," said one Republican congressional aide.

@_subject: Book Review: The secrets of cryptography 
by Joel Enos
January 08, 2001
At last, a book about secret codes that isn't boring or too technical! As any kid from any era knows, the pinnacle of privacy is the secret code (from decoder rings to James Bond to Harriet the Spy and beyond). So why is it that when most authors write about cryptography (or, as Steven Levy abbreviates it, "crypto") they leave out the fun factor and simply veer off into computer geek-speak about lines of data and whatnot? Who knows? And who cares now that Levy has written the definitive story of crypto so far, keeping all the excitement and drama surrounding the topic intact. Levy's latest work (he's also the author of "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution," which, when it appeared, made the term a permanent part of our Silicon subculture) has a writing style that's a seamless blend of his other lives, chief technology writer for Newsweek (thus a brisk, to-the-point tone), freelance writer for Wired ("Crypto" is speculative and analytical as much as it is informative) and for Macworld (while the book isn't techie, it's obvious Levy is, and, when he has to, he can explain code, and what it takes to crack one, quickly and easily). The result is a riveting story that begins with the meeting of Mary Fischer and Whitfield Diffie in the late '70s and moves on to the present-day controversy surrounding the delicate Internet balance of privacy vs. freely available information. The story does explain the background you'll need to comprehend what cryptography is (divisions between public and private keys, where they came from, etc.) and why it's important (many of us may not realize we reap its benefits every day, on everything from ATMs to online shopping), but sticks to the human element of the tale rather than simply "the facts." In the end, you get a history lesson and a new set of questions to ponder (such as, where is this all going to go?) filtered through the people at the core of the controversy. Levy interviewed basically all the privacy luminaries, from Fischer and Diffie to Phil Zimmerman (head of Pretty Good Privacy). From them, he's managed to create what reads more like a novel than a history book -- and certainly comes off nothing like a computer history book. Empowering the people For those who want to jump right to the juicy bits, the best section of Crypto is "Crypto Anarchy" focusing on Zimmerman's "hatred of Big Brother" and his drive to "write his own public key encryption program -- for the people" and the subsequent government backlash. Levy includes just enough verbatim legislation from the infamous U.S. Senate Bill 266 from 1991 (as worded by then head of the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Joseph Biden) to strike fear in the hearts of all encryption nuts and privacy advocates. And his portrayal of Zimmerman as the freeware rebel flying around uploading PGP to the Net via a laptop, acoustic coupler and various pay phones is priceless. All in all, "Crypto" is a good introduction to a relatively young public policy issue (how private will the government allow us to be with our electronic communications?) that is only now starting to be addressed or even understood.

Gates, who had a 27-year career with the CIA and served as its director under George Bush, is being looked to for his expertise in security and intelligence issues, while Hallman, Microsoft's president from April 1990 to March 1992, would seek investment opportunities for LiveGrip, ABI said.

@_subject: Article:  The coming backlash in privacy 
[From The Economist magazine]
New privacy services will soon allow consumers to buy goods anonymously online�forcing web-based retailers to change the way they do business
OVER the past couple of months, a Dallas-based company called Digital Convergence has given away more than 1m bar-code scanners to computer users across America. If the company sticks to its business plan, it will have handed out some 40m by this time next year. The scanners cost around $10 apiece. So why the sudden generosity? Because the company expects to get its money back, and more, by selling information about the users� purchasing habits.
Scanning the bar codes on a packet of cornflakes, say, sends the user�s Internet browser to the manufacturer�s website. Each scanner, known as a CueCat, comes with its own unique identifier code and software to operate it. On installing the software, the user is required to register personal details such as name, e-mail address, age, sex and post code. Such details can then be correlated with the information that the CueCat gleans about the products a user scans. The company hopes that such marketing information will eventually be worth more than the $400m it plans to spend seeding the market with CueCats.
But the company had not reckoned with the ingenuity of users of Linux software. Noted for their programming skills and their contempt for Microsoft�s Windows, a group of Linux hackers decided to let CueCat work on computers that use the free Linux operating system instead of the ubiquitous Windows. Being a mischievous bunch, they wrote their software so that it would bypass Digital Convergence�s own computers. And for a laugh, they made a Windows version available as well. Just days after the CueCats were released, free scanning software started appearing on the Internet and was downloaded eagerly by countless users. Digital Convergence was not amused. For the company, every hacked CueCat was another $10 down the drain. Data mavens
A number of e-commerce ventures have been based on the proposition that retailers, manufacturers and advertisers are ready to pay large sums to get their hands on marketing data collected by online services that bribe users with some free offer to divulge their personal details. But, as the hacked CueCats show, companies that do this are likely, sooner or later, to be bitten by their own customers. Indeed, life is getting harder for online firms that try to survive by exploiting the marketing data they collect. Consumers have become far more concerned about invasions of their privacy, and they are now being given the technology to protect themselves. Recently, two controversial incidents have caused politicians and consumer groups to turn their attention to online privacy. After vociferous complaints, DoubleClick, an online advertising agency based in New York, aborted its plan to merge its records of people�s visits to websites with its database of users� names and addresses. And public opprobrium was heaped on Toysmart, a failed Internet start-up, for violating one of its own privacy pledges when it tried to sell its customer database to another retailer.
Soon, consumers will no longer have to rely solely on the integrity of online merchants to limit what advertisers glean about their web-surfing practices. A new breed of privacy-service provider, or �infomediary�, is learning to make money from protecting people�s privacy by short-circuiting the way that online retailers secretly accumulate information about visitors to their websites.
One infomediary that works with consumers, Lumeria, based in Berkeley, California, aims to let its users evade marketers selectively�and to earn money in the process. The company�s free software encrypts a user�s profile and stores it on its own computers. Whenever the user wants to access the Internet, he can use Lumeria�s computer as a proxy-server, to stop his personal details from being transmitted direct to any advertisers. The proxy-server intercedes between the user and every web page, allowing only those adverts that match the user�s interest profile to appear on his browser. Anonymous, aggregated information is then sold to marketers, with a royalty paid to the user.
The only survivors
For the more paranoid, iPrivacy of New York has come up with software that can shield a user�s activities so completely that not even the company itself has access to the information. In iPrivacy�s scheme, a user begins by downloading software from a company he knows and trusts�for instance, his credit-card company or bank. The software allows the user to browse in complete privacy. When he wishes to buy something, the program generates a new identity for him�complete with a fictitious name and e-mail address, a coded postal address, and a one-off credit-card number.
This fresh identity is passed, via the online merchant, back to the credit-card company, which matches the details with the user�s real identity and approves the transaction. Meanwhile, the post office is sent a decoded address label, but still a coded name, and ships the goods. The only entity that knows what is actually going on is the user�s original credit-card company, which had all the personal information already. Two added bonuses are that, because the fictitious identity is used only once, it is impossible for online marketers to develop a profile of the user�or for criminals to profit from its theft.
Ruvan Cohen, iPrivacy�s chief executive, has already made a contract with the United States Postal Service for decoding addresses. The company is also working with financial-services firms that want to license the software for their clients. The main reason such a firm might be interested is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, passed in November 1999, which requires financial institutions to disclose details of who sees the private information they collect from customers. The first disclosure statements must be sent out by July 2001.
Not surprisingly, many financial institutions, anxious about their customers� reactions, are looking for ways to shore up their reputations for confidentiality. American Express has already launched a free one-off system of credit-card payment and intends to provide its customers with a private web-browsing service by the end of 2000. Other credit-card suppliers plan to test iPrivacy�s software early next year so as to be ready for the July deadline. If enough users take advantage of these online filters, the benefits for e-commerce could outweigh the costs. Forrester Research, a technology consultancy based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reckons that privacy concerns stopped consumers from completing more than $12 billion of online purchases last year.
One worry, however, is that a privacy backlash by consumers could make it harder than ever for online retailers to turn a profit. Amazon.com, the world�s largest online retailer, relies heavily on its marketing database to �personalise� its interactions with its 20m customers. Loyal customers swear by Amazon�s uncanny ability to recommend genuinely useful purchases. But if enough users camouflage themselves, Amazon will no longer be able to send special offers of, say, toys to customers who have just bought some children�s books. And this kind of cross-marketing is a mainstay of Amazon�s business model.
Many online firms have played a zero-sum game that predicated their own profitability on their customers� loss of privacy. The balance may soon tip the other way. The danger is that it could tip too far in the consumer�s favour. Ironically, online consumers could then find themselves being treated rather like offline customers�with free offers and the rest becoming a thing of the past.

@_subject: Fingerprints Replaces Lunch Money 
Finger Food Q Students in Pennsylvania are giving the lunch lady the finger.
JJJJA new system which uses fingerprint scanners to let kids pay for school lunches is getting raves from students and school administrators, but is making privacy advocates nervous.
The scanners make stealable lunch money, lose-able swipe cards and the stigma of being known as the free-lunch kid things of the past, says Walter Curfman, superintendent of the Tussey Mountain School District in western Pennsylvania.
RYou always have your finger with you, unless you cut it off,S he said.
But Andrew Shen of the Electronic Privacy Information Center worries about how well the information will be protected from being spread around throughout the government.
ROnce you have a collection of fingerprints starting from such an early age, I can imagine this being used for other purposes in the futureS such as law enforcement, he said. Popular System
The system from Altoona, Penn.-based Food Service Solutions is currently being piloted in middle and high schools at Tussey Mountain and neighboring Penn Cambria School District in rural western Pennsylvania, and Lower Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia. So far, itUs unique to the Keystone state, FSS president Mitch Johns said.
It works on a debit account system Q parents put money in, and students order food. When the account runs low, a letter goes out to the parents. Parents can also restrict studentsU shopping Ra la carteS Q buying extra food not on the dayUs set menu. Students can also choose to buy items with cash.
So far, kids have taken to the new system, said Tussey Mountain cafeteria director Deb Stepisianos. Though the kids goof around a bit Q putting the wrong finger down and such Q so far only three sets of parents have opted out of the program, she said.
And as TusseyUs system was a beta test, theyUve had some trouble with the software, choking up lunch lines.
RWhen it works, itUs wonderful,S she said. Going Too Far?
The scanning system was developed in response to a federal regulation requiring that cafeterias hide whoUs getting free or reduced-price lunches, Curfman said.
But cafeterias that use swipe cards or PIN numbers and debit accounts fulfill the same requirement and are often cheaper to run, according to Dennis Waiter, national marketing director at ARAMARK, which operates cafeterias at 350 school districts across the nation.
FSSU system costs Tussey Mountain about $50,000 for its four schools plus $4,000-5,000 a year for maintenance, Curfman said. A swipe card system from SNAP Systems, the nationUs largest purveyor of such systems, would cost between $28,000-60,000 for a district that size, plus about $3,000-4,000 a year for maintenance, according to Gloria Calvo of SNAP. FSS wants to expand its fingerprint system for use in attendance taking and on school door locks, as the use of biometric scanners is spreading in U.S. schools. Eagen High School in St. Paul, Minn., for instance, has been using fingerprint scanners to check out books at the school library since last academic year.
Fingerprints have the stigma of criminality, privacy advocates said, and thereUs no guarantee the data wouldnUt get out to law enforcement authorities or other agencies later in the game.
RAt some point my bet is, somebodyUs parents are going to file some sort of a lawsuit,S said Anne Cavoukian, data privacy commissioner for the government of Ontario in Canada. RI think youUre going to have some litigation on your hands: Twhy are you treating our children like common criminals?US
StudentsU biometric data Q such as fingerprint records Q is considered a student record and falls under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a 1974 privacy law. In most cases, the law says parents have to give written permission every time a studentUs records are released to an organization other than the school system.
But there are exceptions to FERPA that are different for every school district in the nation. Usually, lawyers said, schools have to give up their records if a judge or a district attorney asks. Districts differ on whether private lawyers can also grab student records for use in lawsuits, and when the police can do it. No Clear Picture
Of course, thatUs if the police could even make use of the fingerprint scan data Q and whether they can is unclear.
FSS uses a fingerprint scanner from Groupe Sagem, a French company. The Sagem scanner doesnUt store images of fingerprints. Instead, it records a few dozen points on a fingerprint and turns the location of those points into a number. The way the system is currently configured, itUs more than 99 percent efficient for up to 3,000 kids, said Steve Ketcham, a programmer for Food Service Solutions.
You canUt recreate fingerprint images from the data in the system, but if law enforcement had a similar system, they could match up the numbers. And Ketcham said FSSU system is a Rstripped down version of the AFIS,S a fingerprint-recognition system used by law enforcement.
But Johns insists the numbers produced from the finger scanners canUt be used by any other system.
RI see no way for that process to be used by anybody else,S he said. Copyright ) 2001 ABC News Internet Ventures.

@_subject: Leo Marks Obituary 
Leo Marks
LEO MARKS, who has died aged 80, was the chief cryptographer of Special Operations Executive during the Second World War; later he wrote the script for Peeping Tom, the film which destroyed the career of its director Michael Powell.
Between 1942, when he joined SOE, and 1946, when he rejected an offer of employment from MI6, Marks proved himself a code-maker and breaker of rare genius.
While still in his early twenties he revolutionised the construction and security of SOE's cyphers. And by his re-invention of the "one-time pad" he eventually influenced code systems used by secret services the world over.
In the latter stages of the war he was entrusted with devising encryption systems for, among others, the SAS and the Free French. Unbeknown to the latter, Marks had already cracked General de Gaulle's private cypher in a spare moment on the lavatory.
He began his career as a cryptographer at the age of eight in his father's antiquarian bookshop in London, Marks & Co, later the subject of Helen Hanff's memoir 84 Charing Cross Road (1971).
One morning his father Benjamin showed Leo a first edition of The Gold Bug by Edgar Allan Poe, which he had just bought for  10s. Knowing that it would interest American collectors, he intended to price it at The book's tale of hidden treasure the whereabouts of which was concealed by a cypher entranced Leo, and he set about breaking his father's own secret pricing code, a series of letters pencilled inside the cover of each book.
Within minutes he had found the key (the 10 letters of Marks Cohen, the two partners in the business, each corresponded to a number) and gained two ambitions: to become an expert on codes and, like Poe, to write horror stories.
In January 1942, Marks was called up and went to Bedford to train as a cryptographer, an opening secured for him by a godfather in Special Branch.
He was the only one of his intake not to be sent on to Bletchley Park; instead, having in an evening cracked a code intended to be spread as a group exercise across a week, he was labelled a misfit and dispatched to Baker Street, the headquarters of the recently formed Special Operations Executive.
Marks almost contrived to fail his interview, taking all day to break a cypher that he had been expected to decode in only 20 minutes with the help of a key. SOE's head of codes had forgotten to give him the necessary piece of paper, and in his memoir Between Silk and Cyanide (1998) Marks drew a vivid and often angry portrait of an organisation capable of both brilliance and lethal carelessness. It was also one in which Marks, as a quick-witted Jew, often felt an outsider.
The title of his book referred to the new codes Marks had devised and had had printed on silk squares, and the poison carried by agents - life and death. He had had to come up with new cyphers because when he inspected SOE's methods for communicating with its agents in the field he was horrified to discover that the traffic could be read by the Germans with ease.
The agents were using well-known poems as the cyphers for encoding their messages, and these could either be guessed by an enemy armed with reference books, or simply tortured out of captured operatives.
His initial solution was to use original poems instead as cyphers. Many of these he wrote himself, the best known being that which he gave to the agent Violette Szabo, The Life That I Have. He had actually written it for a girl with whom he was in love, the news of whose death in an air crash he heard on Christmas Eve 1943. The poem was subsequently used in the film made about Violette Szabo, Carve Her Name With Pride (1958), and generated an enormous response.
Marks took great pains to get to know the agents he briefed, among them his close friend Forest Yeo-Thomas - "The White Rabbit" - and Noor Inayat Khan, who suffered from the handicap for a spy of having been brought up never to lie.
It could be difficult, as happened to Marks, to brief a man and then hear two days later that the Gestapo had tortured him horribly. But it was vital for him to understand the temperament of each agent, as this helped him with the other important area of his work, deciphering the garbled messages transmitted by agents under stress.
It was vital that any such "indecipherables" - up to 20 per cent of the daily traffic - should be read as quickly as possible so that, with the Gestapo on the prowl, the agent need not risk his life to resend it.
As Marks knew the coding idiosyncrasies of each agent - an inability to spell a certain word or a habit of transposing two columns in a cypher - he was often able to decipher the signals himself, but he also recruited 400 young women from the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (Fany) to help him break indecipherables.
When interviewing these girls Marks did not look for mathematical ability but for an interest in music and an aptitude for crosswords, believing these were better pointers to cryptographic talent; he himself was already regularly setting crosswords for The Times.
Marks's helpers, based at Grendon Underwood in Buckinghamshire, proved immensely proficient and dedicated. One message was deciphered with seconds to spare after 650,000 separate attempts.
It was the lack of indecipherables in the traffic of SOE's Dutch section which first alerted Marks to the so-called Englandspiel, the most serious disaster to befall SOE.
Marks deduced that since no signals from Holland were ever corrupted, the Germans must have penetrated the network and be controlling the transmitters. He was right, but his suspicions fell on deaf ears - or on those playing a longer game - and up to 50 Dutch agents went unnecessarily to their deaths.
Thereafter Marks concentrated on perfecting codes that could not be discovered by the Germans. His solution was simple and brilliant - to use one-off cyphers, printed on silk which the agent then cut away and burnt so that he could not remember them.
These "worked-out keys" not only reduced the incidence of garbling but, being random in origin, were much harder for the Germans to crack. Silk also had the advantage of being easily hidden in the lining of clothes, and if they were caught each agent was given a method of letting SOE know that he was transmitting under duress.
By D-Day, when SOE's agents tied down thousands of German troops, Marks's silks were being used from Normandy to Sarawak. They were particularly gratefully received by the Free French, who routed all their traffic through SOE, allowing Marks to read politically sensitive material destined for de Gaulle. By then he had also refined the one-time pad, first invented by the Germans, in which a code was made by adding to numbers representing set phrases another pre-agreed series of numbers. The only copies of these were held by the agent and his masters, and used just once.
Marks, who needed no invitation to demonstrate his intelligence, adapted the system to use letters instead of numbers, an idea already being used independently at Bletchley.
But Marks's drive and determination ensured that the code became widely disseminated within the British secret services, and in time it became standard cryptographic technique.
He retained discreet informal links with the Intelligence Service after the war and devised several other important new types of code; indeed, so central did his wartime work remain to modern cypher practice that he was unable to disclose much of it in his autobiography, the publication of which was delayed by the authorities for more than a decade after he had completed it.
Leopold Samuel Marks was born in London on September 24 1920. An only child, he was educated at St Paul's and then helped out in his father's shop, where customers included Charlie Chaplin, Aleister Crowley and Sigmund Freud. After the war, Marks turned to writing for the stage and screen, and had some success in the West End with plays such as The Girl Who Couldn't Quite (1947) and The Best Damn Lie (1957), which made use of a lie detector.
Indeed much of his literary work, which in truth was largely forgettable, seemed to hark back to his previous career. Thus the film Cloudburst (1951) was about a vengeful codebreaker; Sebastian (1967), with John Gielgud, concerned an academic code expert turned spy.
Quite different from all these was Peeping Tom (1960). At its most superficial, it is the shocking story of a man, terrorised as a child by his father, who grows up obsessed with fear. He gets his kicks by filming young women as he murders them with a blade concealed within his camera.
At a deeper level, the film is a meditation on the voyeuristic nature of cinema. Since the man's crimes are seen by the audience through his lens, they are in effect asked to identify themselves with his murderous acts.
Marks's notably intelligent script, influenced by his lifelong interest in psychoanalysis, contains a number of in-jokes, notably that a director in the film is played by the blind actor Esmond Knight, and that the name Leo Marks gave his protagonist was Mark Lewis.
Although now recognised as a strange but serious work, at the time the film proved too disturbing for audiences and critics. It was described as "evil and pornographic" and the reaction against it ended the illustrious career of its director, Michael Powell.
Marks went on to work with the Boulting Brothers, whom he also almost finished with another film about a homicidal maniac, Twisted Nerve (1968). He never again reached the heights of Peeping Tom. So provocative is its reputation that it was not possible to show it on British television until 1997.
The film is the primary influence on the cinema of the director Martin Scorsese; he acknowledged his debt in 1988 when he asked Marks to play the voice of Satan in his similarly controversial The Last Temptation of Christ.
Marks's father died in 1968, but he was not tempted to take over the shop, living instead quietly in west London. He was good company, enjoyed showing that he knew more than he said, but kept secrets as well as any man. Though a natural cynic, he was also a romantic.
In person he was short and powerful, with a grip of iron and a voice like new velvet. He was an habitue of the Special Forces Club.
He married, in 1966 (dissolved 2000), the portrait painter Elena Gaussen.

@_subject: Shooting down 'Bandit Satellites' 
[Sorry about the name. "Pirate" satellites don't sound 'dangerous' enough to need shooting down.]
Suppose can-sats WERE launched illegally, and then started broadcasting  signals, along with a spoken commentary by Radio Free North America (so Joe Sixpack has an excuse when those nice detector van gentlemen knock on his door and ask why he's listening to 128.0 FM) What could a the US Government do about the satellite, other than make an example out of the miscreants who launched it?
Would they be able to physically shoot at it, jam its signal or burn out its electronics from the ground or aircraft altitude? Could someone put up enough disposable 'bandit-sats' (expecting to make less orbits than Sputnik) over time to make it uneconomical to keep shooting them out of the sky?
How easy would it be for the launch crew to stay ahead of ground based forces? I'm guessing they could mount rockets one to two months ahead of launch date and abandon the site, assuming the rockets don't need constant attention. Would directional transmissions from ground to satellite be traceable (and would this depend on whether there are other birds in the part of the sky I want to send to)?
Would retrieval of a returned film capsule be possible before Air Force helicopters descended on the landing site?

Bad News for Snoops
By Fiona Ross, Smart Business
March 12, 2001 9:00 PM PT
URL: The delicate balance between personal privacy and national security just grew more precarious with the passing of part three of the United Kingdom's RIP law, or Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (see "Losing the Company Keys," February, page 48). Under the new law, the British government can monitor and store all Internet traffic for seven years, as well as demand files and PGP keys from its citizens' computers. Enter M-o-o-t ( a new open source cryptography project designed to help people get around RIP and similar laws and technologies, including the FBI's controversial snooping system, Carnivore. Peter Fairbrother, Crypto/Oversight Group leader of the U.K.-based organization, says the project spawned from concern about governments spying on citizens. Fairbrother admits that M-o-o-t won't end spying, but he says his group expects to stop "trawling methods and mass surveillance." RIP and Carnivore were ostensibly passed to help fight terrorism, espionage, information warfare, and child pornography, so the FBI and Scotland Yard aren't likely to be pleased with M-o-o-t's efforts. Even Fairbrother concedes, "It is inevitable that 'M-o-o-t' will be abused. However, we are more worried about abuse by governments if M-o-o-t isn't written." The self-contained software will be shipped on a bootable CD. User data and mail will be encrypted and stored in offshore data havens, bypassing local storage. Untraceable e-mail and telephony are also in the works.

Militant environmental group targets FBI, others
By SAM STANTON
Scripps-McClatchy Western Service
March 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Two weeks after claiming responsibility for its first arson attack in California, the Earth Liberation Front has issued a nationwide call for "militant direct action" against FBI offices and other federal buildings.
The militant environmental group, which the FBI has called the nation's most dangerous domestic terror organization, on Tuesday issued a statement asking its followers to engage in actions against the federal government on April 5.
That date coincides with the scheduled pretrial hearing of Frank Ambrose, who has been charged in Bloomington, Ind., with tree-spiking and is suspected to be an ELF member.
Ambrose has denied the charges and his case has become a rallying point for environmental activists who believe he is being unfairly targeted by FBI agents anxious to win a court victory against an alleged ELF follower.
Sacramento FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said his agency had little to say about the ELF announcement or FBI security efforts.
"We evaluate each threat on a case by case basis," Rossi said.
The announcement calls for protests at a time of year when federal agencies typically are at a heightened state of alert because of the April 19 anniversaries of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing and the raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.
The call for action on April 5 came through e-mail messages sent to individuals who have asked to be updated on ELF activities. The messages are forwarded by a group of activists based in Portland, Ore., who deny any membership in the group.
One of the activists, Lesliejames Pickering, said Tuesday that he believed the latest announcement indicated there would be demonstrations of "support for radical action."
"Militant means more organized, more strategic," Pickering said. "There are going to be protests nationwide."
He added that he expected protest sites to include either Sacramento or San Francisco.
The shadowy organization, which has no official members, says it is a worldwide group that includes anyone who takes action to protect the environment without injuring or killing anyone.
The group claims to have caused at least $37 million in damages to various timber operations, ski resorts and other entities ELF members believe have hurt the environment.
In one of its latest efforts, the ELF claims to have set a Feb. 20 pre-dawn fire at a cotton gin near Visalia that caused $700,000 in damage. The group claimed it targeted the plant because it contained genetically engineered cotton seeds.
But officials said there were no such seeds at the gin, and a fire investigator said Tuesday that officials have not been able to corroborate the group's claims of setting the blaze.
The ELF claimed to have placed barrels containing a total of 20 gallons of gasoline and other fuel around the inside of the plant.
Capt. Mike Davidson of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said a dog trained to detect accelerants at arsons was sent inside the cotton gin and found no scent of the fuel.
"I personally believe that if there were 20 gallons of accelerant inside the dog would have smelled it and the firefighters would have smelled it (when they arrived on the scene)," Davidson said. "I can't eliminate the possibility that the Earth Liberation Front set the fire; I can say that they didn't do the fire the way they said they did."
However, FBI officials have said the group's previous claims of responsibility for such actions generally have been accurate. And officials are concerned that the fire in Visalia and the recent announcements indicate ELF followers are planning to increase the number and frequency of such attacks.
