@_subject: Secure Drive questions... 
Hi, I recently got me a much larger hard drive and would like to encrypt more than one partition using SecureDrive.  I'm using an old 1.1 version which, when I log into one partition, the others vanish.  I'm using the same passphrase on both paritions.
I've never upgraded because the previous version did what I wanted it to do very well and I have never had a problem with it.  I've noticed that on some machines SecureDevice failed where SecureDrive 1.1 worked perfectly...  So I've stuck with that... but now, I'd rather not join the two partitions together if I can help it... too much work to copy everything off, repartition, restore, etc...  (This is a 1.2Gb WD Caviar drive using the Disk Manager crud that makes the drive visible to DOS by loading some DMDRVR.BIN driver only - my BIOS only sees 550Mb or so without it...)
Is this a question of upgrading, if so, what's the latest version?  And are there any catches, snags, or problems to watch out for before I potentially kill my drives? :-)
A few more questions, I've left a bit of space for me to experiment with something like OS/2Warp or Win95 or even Netware 4.1 (got a cool 2 user license for $50 from Novell I'd like to install.)  Now while OS/2 and Win95 can see FAT partitions, what will stop them from trying to run something like chkdsk on it?  Can I load the secure drive tsr to keep the encrypted drive safe with those operating systems?  (I know Netware will keep its mits off non-Netware partitions, so that's a safe bet - but then I don't have another PC to use as a host so this will
be a clientless server. Just want to experiment with it I guess...  :-)
I'd also consider messing with NT, I have enough RAM and space, but anyone know a place I can get a good price for it? $400 is a bit steep for an OS I probably won't do much with.
And YES, I will install Linux - soon as I can get it to recognize my I/O-less FutureDomain clone SCSI controller. (It's based on the 950 chip, no I/O address, uses int 15 and DMA for transfers..)   Works okay under Coherent - then again, I'm using the IDE controller under Coherent... :-)
The SCSI FD controller is for the CDROM drive...

@_subject: Time release crypto 
Some of the following is probably idiotically obvious, but to prevent an attack on such a time keeper, it could be tied in to the atomic clocks, it could poll several PC's and check their time... any significant major time change would be spotted immediatly...  that is you couldn't possibly change the time on many machines at the same time without having physical access to all the machines, etc.  Altering the time on an atomic clock would be visible to just about everyone, etc.
This in now way would prevent an attacker from stealing the passphrase to the time signing service, so it wouldn't prevent anyone from issuing false keys.  But by using a hardware random generator the time keeping service could know if it issued a key or not by storing all the keys it issued previously.
This would achive the following: even if a theif stole the key, with enough randomization, the stolen keys would show up as valid, but would not show up in the time server's database - which should be written to write-once-media such as worm, or CDROM, etc...  the stolen key would generate valid time signatures, but would not be on the database, so it would be clear it was forged.  To get around this, the bad guy would need constant physical access to the time keeper, not just a single black bag This also means that this database must be publically searchable at all times.  Perhaps the generator phassphrase should also be changed randomly as time passes - but then these things too would have to be stored somewhere before the time the key expires...
This is probably a bit far fetched, but the time keeper could be tied into astronomical events - that is have it follow the path of planets, star systems, etc. and derrive time that way and compare it with what time it thinks it is.  This would require quite a lot of sensors and extra hardware to track stars, planets, etc...   The bad guy would have to do a lot more work to get around this...  basically what you want to do is track some totally unalterable event to keep track of time, and we presume the NSA cannot change the orbits of planets... yet. ;-)
Another method would be to set up a key breaking system which would accept weaker keys - say 300 bits or so, and start breaking them.  This wouldn't guarantee they wouldn't be broken before such and such time, and wouldn't prevent anyone from running their own on faster hardware, or building special hardware optimized to break it faster though...  but without the private key, the only way to break it would be to brute force  + ^ + |  Ray Arachelian | Amerika: The land of the Freeh. |   _ |>

[This Bible excerpt awaiting review under the Communications Decency Act]
And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
don't you boys just come on in and do em right here in my house - I'll just
watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said. "Dad's
getting old. I say we should do him." So the two daughters got him drunk and
did him all that night. Sure enough, Dad got em pregnant....Onan really
hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant while
his brother got all the credit, so he whacked off first....Remember, it's
not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your brother, your parents,
your pet dog, or the farm animals. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern

There's an easy test.. set up the real RC2 to encrypt data and have this one decrypt it, then reverse the two, use different keys, etc...  a few thousand rounds should give a strong indication if this is the true RC2.
It doesn't mean that it wasn't rigged to produce weak keys and such, however a closer analysis of the source will point that out. :)

       THE X-ON CONGRESS:  INDECENT COMMENT ON AN INDECENT SUBJECT
       ***********************************************************
                            by  Steve Russell
                     American Reporter Correspondent
 SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- You motherfuckers in Congress have dropped over the
 edge of the earth this time.  I understand that very few of the swarm of
 high dollar lobbyists around the Telecommunications Bill had any interest
 in content regulation -- they were just trying to get their clients an
 opportunity to dip their buckets in the money stream that cyberspace may
 become -- but the public interest sometimes needs a little attention.
 Keeping your eyes on what big money wants, you have sold out the First
 Amendment.
 First, some basics.  If your children walked by a public park and heard
 some angry sumbitches referring to Congress as "the sorriest bunch of
 cocksuckers ever to sell out the First Amendment" or suggesting that
 "the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists'
 dicks and fuck the people who sent you there," no law would be violated
 (assuming no violation of noise ordinances or incitement to breach the
 peace).  If your children did not wish to hear that language, they could
 only walk away.  Thanks to your heads-up-your-ass dereliction of duty,
 if they read the same words in cyberspace, they could call the FBI!
 Cyberspace is the village green for the whole world. It is the same as the
 village green our Founders knew as the place to rouse the rabble who became
 Americans, but it is also different.  Your blind acceptance of the dubious -
 - make that dogass dumb --idea that children are harmed by hearing so-called
 dirty words has created some pretty stupid regulations without shutting down
 public debate, but those stupid regulations will not import to cyberspace
 without consequences that even the public relations whores in Congress
 should find unacceptable.
 In cyberspace, there is no time.  A posted message stays posted until it is
 wiped.  Therefore, there is no way to indulge the fiction that children do
 not stay up late or cannot program a VCR.  In cyberspace, there is no place.
 The "community standards" are those of the whole world.  An upload from
 Amsterdam can become a download in Idaho.  By trying to regulate obscenity
 and indecency on the Internet, you have reduced the level of expression
 allowed consenting adults to that of the most anal retentive blueballed
 fuckhead U.S. attorney in the country. The Internet is everywhere you can
 plug in a modem.  Call Senator Exon an "ignorant motherfucker" in Lincoln,
 Nebraska and find yourself prosecuted in Bibleburg, Mississippi.
 In cyberspace, you cannot require the convenience store to sell Hustler in
 a white sleeve.  The functional equivalent is gatekeeper software, to which
 no civil libertarian has voiced any objection. Gatekeeper software cannot be
 made foolproof, but can you pandering pissants not see that any kid smart
 enough to hack into a Website is also smart enough to get his hands on a
 hard copy of Hustler if he really wants one?
 In cyberspace, there is the illusion of anonymity but no real privacy.
 It is theoretically possible for any Internet server to seine through all
 messages for key words (although it seems likely the resulting slowdown
 would be noticeable).  Perhaps some of you read about America On Line's
 attempt to keep children from reading the word "breast?"  An apparently
 unforeseen consequence was the shutdown of a discussion group of breast
 cancer survivors.  Don't you think more kids are aware of "teat"
 (pronounced "tit") than of "breast?"  Can skirts on piano legs, er, limbs
 be far behind?
 But silly shit like this is just a pimple on the ass of the long-term
 consequences for politics, art and education.  You have passed a law that
 will get less respect than the 55 m.p.h. speed limit dead bang in the middle
 of the First Amendment.  Indecency is nothing but a matter of fashion;
 obscenity is the same but on a longer timeline.  This generation freely
 reads James Joyce and Henry Miller and the Republic still stands.
 The home of the late alleged pornographer D. H. Lawrence is now a beautiful
 writers' retreat in the mountains above Taos, managed by the University of
 New Mexico.
 Universities all have Internet servers, and every English Department has at
 least one scholar who can read Chaucer's English -- but not on the Internet
 anymore.  Comparative literature classes might read Boccaccio --but not on
 the Internet anymore.  What if some U. S. Attorney  hears about Othello and
 Desdemona "making the beast with two backs" -- is interracial sex no longer
 indecent anywhere in the country, or is Shakespeare off the Internet?
 Did you know you can download video and sound from the Internet?
 Yes, that means you can watch other people having sex if that is interesting
 to you, live or on tape.  Technology can make such things hard to retrieve,
 but probably not impossible.  And since you have swept right past obscenity
 and into indecency, the baby boomers had better keep their old rock 'n roll
 tapes off the Internet.
 When the Jefferson Airplane sang "her heels rise for me," they were not
 referring to a dance step.  And if some Brit explains the line about
 "finger pie" in Penny Lane, the Beatles will be gone.  All of those school
 boards that used to ban "The Catcher in the Rye" over cussing and spreading
 the foul lie that kids masturbate can now go to federal court and get that
 nasty book kept out of cyberspace.
 But enough about the past.  What about rap music?  No, I do not care much
 for it either -- any more than I care for the language you shitheads have
 forced me to use in this essay -- but can you not see the immediate
 differential impact of this law by class and race?  What is your defense -
 -that there are no African-Americans on the Internet, since they are too
 busy pimping and dealing crack?  If our educational establishment has any
 sense at all, they will be trying to see more teens of all colors on the
 Internet, because there is a lot to be learned in cyberspace that has
 nothing to do with sex.
 There are plenty of young people in this country who have legitimate
 political complaints.  When you dickheads get done with Social Security,
 they will be lucky if the retirement age is still in double digits.
 But thanks to the wonderful job the public schools have done keeping sex
 and violence out, we have a lot of intelligent kids who cannot express
 themselves without indecent language. I have watched lawyers in open court
 digging their young clients in the ribs every time the word "fuck" slipped
 out.
 Let's talk about this fucking indecent language bullshit.  Joe Shea, my
 editor, does not want it in his newspaper, and I respect that position.
 He might even be almost as upset about publishing this as I am about
 writing it. I do use salty language in my writing, but sparingly, only
 as a big hammer.  Use the fucking shit too fucking much and it loses its
 fucking impact --see what I mean?  Fiction follows different rules, and if
 you confine your fiction writing to how the swell people want to see
 themselves using language, you not only preclude literary depiction of
 most people but you are probably false to the people you purport to depict.
 Do you remember how real language used by real people got on the air and in
 the newspapers?  Richard Nixon, while he was president, speaking in the
 White House about official matters.  A law professor and a nominee for
 Supreme Court Justice arguing about pubic hairs and porno movies during
 Senate hearings. Are these matters now too indecent for the Internet?
 How much cleansing will be required of the online news services?
 Answer: Enough cleansing to meet the standard of what is appropriate
 for a child in the most restrictive federal judicial district.
 This is bullshit -- unconstitutional bullshit and also bad policy bullshit.
 To violate your ban on indecency, I have been forced to use and overuse
 so-called indecent language.  But if I called you a bunch of goddam
 motherfucking cocksucking cunt-eating blue-balled bastards with the morals
 of muggers and the intelligence of pond scum, that would be nothing compared
 to this indictment, to wit: you have sold the First Amendment,
 your birthright and that of your children.  The Founders turn in their
 graves.  You have spit on the grave of every warrior who fought under the
 Stars and Stripes.
 And what mess of pottage have you acquired in exchange for the rights of a
 free people?  Have you cleansed the Internet of even the rawest pornography?
 No, because it is a worldwide system.  You have, however, handed the
 government a powerful new tool to harass its critics: a prosecution for
 indecent commentary in any district in the country.
 Have you protected one child from reading dirty words?  Probably not, if you
 understand what the economists call "substitution" -- but you have leveled
 the standards of political debate to a point where a history buff would not
 dare to upload some of the Federalist v. Anti-Federalist election rhetoric
 to a Website.
 Since the lobby reporting requirements were not law when the censorship
 discussion was happening, I hope you got some substantial reward for what
 you gave up.  Thirty pieces of silver doesn't go far these days.

Here's an idea that come up while I and a good friend were in a well intoxicated and creative mood...
Every dollar you spend, be it a 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 denomination bill, write in a speech bubble to the president dude in the center, which says "I oppose the CDA.  Exon sucks.  Exon fornicates with male farm animals.  CDA Is unconstitutional, I roll in my grave over the CDA, etc."
Be creative; use the memo field in any checks you write to do the same.  Money is the one element that travels from hand to hand to hand to hand.  It is a network as extensitve as the internet itself, and even more so.
Let your money speak for you!  Put your url on the bill, or the url to the eff ( or the Voter's Telecom Watch (

@_subject: META: Filtering/Posting advice 
There are options for those that don't want to read the noise.  I do run a free filtering service, it's certainly not the best in the world, but it's available for free and all who want it.  There are two more that I know of, one for free the other for pay.
I'd like to filter the stuff I send according to topics, but I haven't yet written the tools to do so.  As it is most of my subscribers are happy with the crappy service I provide, much happier than having the whole list delivered to them.
Personally, I am interested in reading the whole list because even some of the noisy messages are worth reading (except for Perry's "This don't belong here" and *PLONK*'s. :)
So there are options for those who want less noise.  I do not beleive it is anyone's place to banish anyone from posting to the list, nor grading a person's worth based on past posts.  Remember that the cypherpunks list is after all headless and should remain that way.  The whole point is to have an anarchic, leaderless, moderatorless list.
Now some Cpunx do have reputations for being on the ball.  Tim and Hal being two such punx.  That doesn't make them moderators, nor does it make them the only voices worth listening to, nor does it make them infallible or on-topic all the time either.
Yet were to to instill a fascist moderated list, their voices would be squelched by definition of what doesn't fit.  Not a cool thing IMNSHO.
Certainly there are cross overs ranging from news bites to Mitnik to conspiracy-paranoia-punks, etc.  I don't mind reading some of the shit to get to the good bits.  You never know, even the shit messages have some worth in the long run.
"If you filter, filter it yourself for yourself" is what I agree with.  Now some folks think that the stuff I filter for them is exactly or close to what they want or better than having to do it themselves.  Fine by me, I'm happy to filter stuff for them.  As much as I'd like Perry to cut the shit and write code instead of spamming the spammers, I'd rather have to put up with the shit than to put up with restrictions on the list.
Just my e$0.02. :)
[Shameless plug: to subscribe to my list, send a >PRIVATE reply, don't reply such that the message will reach cypherpunks at toad.com with the subject being either "FCPUNX HELP" or "FCPUNX SUBSCRIBE" and no quotes...
The 'bots that subscribe folks will refuse any subscription attemts that come via the actual cypherpunks list. :]

@_subject: Public access: Welcome to Juno! (fwd) 
Okay, I took the bait and signed up. Looks like these guys aren't yet ready just yet, but it doesn't look too bad.  It is an automated setup.  Which means that since you upload and download mail and work OFFLINE, there is the possibility of hacking something together so that you can run some automators on your mailbox...  i.e. ftp by mail, pass to pgp, remailer, etc...
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Thank you for your interest in Juno, our free Internet e-mail service. We
are currently preparing for our launch, which we expect to take place
before the end of the first quarter of 1996. Juno Online Services, L.P.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
1) WHEN WILL JUNO BE AVAILABLE?
We plan to release Juno in the first quarter of this year.
2) IS JUNO REALLY FREE?
Yes.  There are no monthly charges to use the service, no set-up fees, no
per-message fees, and no hourly charges. You will be able to download the
software off the Internet (or get it in a variety of other ways). 3) WHAT ABOUT PHONE CHARGES?
It won't be necessary to dial a long-distance telephone number to reach us.
We expect that ultimately the bulk of our users will dial into local access
numbers we provide; we may also use toll-free numbers to supplement our
coverage in some areas where local access numbers are not available.
Also, note that when you use Juno, you are only connected by telephone to
our central computers while you are in the process of uploading and
downloading your new mail.  When you're reading and writing your mail, you
are offline.  This means that the phone calls you do make are likely to be
very short -- under one minute, in most cases.
[*** All we need to do is figgure out their data structures for storing email and we're set to write something to process it. ***]
7) WILL JUNO GIVE ME ACCESS TO THE INTERNET?
Yes.  Your messages will go out over the Internet, meaning that you will be
able to send mail to and receive mail from anyone on the Internet or any of
the commercial online services (such as America Online, CompuServe, and
Prodigy).  However, your computer will not be connected *directly* to the
Internet.  Your computer will be connected to our central computers, and
our computers will be connected to the Internet.
8) DO I NEED TO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE TO USE JUNO?
No.  Juno gives you everything you need to send and receive e-mail over the
<*** Here's the strings ****>
9) WHAT WILL THE ADVERTISING BE LIKE?
One of the major reasons that we are able to provide you with e-mail for
free is that Juno will carry advertising.  (It's the same model that's used
by radio and television.)  However, it is our hope (and plan) to make the
advertising we carry be of greater interest and value to you, and less of a
nuisance, than the advertising you are so often bombarded with over other
Each Juno user will fill out a "member profile" that will help us determine
which advertisements to send to that user, what new services he or she
might be most interested in hearing about, and what other sorts of
information he or she might find useful.  Our goal is to provide users with
information that interests them and is relevant to their needs.
The advertisements on Juno may take several forms; we don't know yet what
all of them will be.  Some ads will appear as interactive banners in the
horizontal "Sponsor's Panel" at the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
If you are interested in a product you see featured in this space, you
will be able to click on the advertisement to request additional
information. Other ads might appear while you are in the process of
uploading and downloading your mail; still others might take the form of
e-mail messages that arrive in your Inbox. (Never more than one or two of
the latter in a given session, though, since getting a mailbox full of
commercial e-mail messages would be very annoying. In most sessions you'll
probably get none.) We plan to experiment with a variety of different
approaches and figure out, by looking at people's responses, what works
best.

Yeah, I'm kinda lusting after something that would work under NT as well as under 95.  Too bad NT won't allow the use of BIOS INT 13 calls so that one may load the SecureDrive TSR. :(  I don't have OS/2, but if I did you could easily add that to the list.
I'm constantly switching between NT and 95 and have them installed on the same drive.  Would be cool to have some low level driver to encryption from the Master Boot Record for example to get around unfriendly OS's- but then NT won't respect the BIOS calls, 95 in 32 bit mode won't, Linux sure as hell wont, etc.... that was the whole idea of having a BIOS in the first place, but woe is us.

Hey guys,
I just got a really cool poster from RSA.  It's a big circle split off into several sections showing people talking to each other, the upper right hand corner shows two NSA dweebs looking like Bevis & Butthead in suits, one smoking, the other seated infront of an old 60's reel to reel audio tape recorder, a sign on the wall behind them says "Key Escrow"
There are several logos for various government agencies including our friends at No Such Agency and the FBI, a small quote next to the Copyright (C) RSA notice says "One of a series of public relations posters that never made it out of Fort Mede."  Very very funny!
Many many thanks to the cool person(s) at RSA who sent it my way.

Not quite what I'm looking for I'm afraid.  What I want is a big partition that's encrypted, but accessible from Windows NT, 95, and Linux.  In other words, I need an encrypted drive device driver for all of the above operating systems that's compatible across them.
So when I'm running NT, I can use the drive, when I'm running 95 I can use the drive, when I'm running Linux I can use the drive.  Now linux has a nice UMS which lets me access DOS drives.  If that were merged with - say SecureDrive, and if SecureDrive were rewritten as a 32 bit VxD minidriver for 95, and if there were a version of the same for NT, >THAT< would be cool. :)

@_subject: Brute Force DES 
IMHO it's more expensive to go this route than to build a machine with
dedicate DES cracking chips. 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 or about 1 terabyte
worth of space, not 500G. 2^39 would be 500Gb. A 4Gb drive these days is $800, hardly a couple of hundred dollars. :)
Even so, that's a ton of hard drives. Further you need machines to hook these drives up to. Infact, you need a farm of machines.  Why?  You can only put 7 on a chain, and maybe if you're lucky four chains in a machine using four controllers.
A better idea might be to make small cheap computers, say based on 8086's or 68000's that replace the drive's controller card, or if that drive controller card is intelligent enough to be a CPU or contain one, burn EEPROMs.  Have the EEPROMs be able to generate DES (or any other cypher's) keyspace given a range, and then have them able to search the whole drive for a match.
Even so, if you build these drive boxes, all you've accomplished is to create a nice huge big searchable array.  You still will need some sort of logic to figgure out when it finds the right key, and you still can't do 3DES or recusively encrypted files, nor know when you've found the key for data you can't recognize - or rather have these drives recognize.
However: Reading a 4Gb drive end to end takes less than 2 hours.  I know this because I have a RAID array of them, and it takes 2 hours to rebuild, so since rebuilding an array requires reading from two drives and writing to one drive, reading a whole 4Gb drive at full speed would be something like maybe 1 to 1.5 hours(???)
You might be better off with 9.0Gb drives if you can afford them because you then have less controller logic cards to build.
The drives alone will cost $204,800.  $800*(2^40/(4*1024*1024*1024)).  You could get a nice big discount if you buy that many, but this will also mean however much it will cost you to build the cpu cards for multiplied by 256 drives, plust the R&D cost, plus the network connection between all the CPU boards.
At that point you also run into the MTBF of the drives which means that your drives will fail quite often.
If you want to go dirt cheap on the CPU's while using this huge space
method, you could just buy something like 37 Mac IIsi's, hook each up to 7
of the drives (you'll have to partition the drives as they won't support
volumes that huge.) and network the machines using localtalk.  You won't
need a faster connection because all you need for networking is keyspace distribution and success reporting.  But then IIsi's are sloooow machines and your searches will suffer a hit from the lack of the machine's speed, plus all the overhead of having an operating system and using the SCSI chain to talk to the drives.
IIsi's go for $350-$500 nicely loaded... $14800 for 37 at $400 a pop, add the drives to that, plus the cost of writing the program and hooking all of this crap together and that'll be  $219,600.  Ya got that kinda dough to spare?

@_subject: WaPo on Crypto-Genie Terrorism 
Oh, how utterly cool.  This being my 1st reply to Sterndark and in the same having managed to move him off the list.  Wheeeee! :)
Come on, you could do better than to run off...
Right, but there's plenty of earthly reason for the government of these same United States to thwart the development of strong crypto, cause the loss of monies that would be made by software companies, cause security breeches in multi-homed companies by not allowing their offices to communicate securely over a strongly encrypted link.  This causes another equivalent of the Berlin wall in terms of crypto exporting.
Notice however that I didn't say Joe Sixpack was a foreigner or a criminal.  You twisted this around to make it seem like he is.  Joe Sixpack is as American as apple pie and patriotic to boot.
So then if the laws are NOT designed to deter criminals (or foreginers)
from using strong crypto, WHY ARE THEY BEING PUSHED ON US?  Could this be
somehow a stupid idea on Freeh's part?  Nah, couldn't be.  Freeh's the
head of the Feebs.  That would be indication that the Feebs hire brainless
folk.  Nope.  Can't be.  Clearly it is because Freeh wants to snoop not on
criminals, but on the law-abiding citizens who pay his paycheck
"voluntarily" via taxes.
As wonderful as the postal inspector mailing kiddie porn to an unsuspecting victim, then arresting said victing when s/he opens up the package.  Gee, how nice it is to meet your arrest quotas, no?  But I digress.
Back to the ITAR and the proposed anti-crypto laws...
Nevermind that should a foreign agent wish to export RSA or PGP could
easily do so >LEGALLY< in a nice OCR'able font, or just have cheap labor type it.  Sure, tie the hands of the software developers so that they can't get their bread and butter from the foreign markets, while the
foreign markets can easily do so here since they can import and sell
The ITARs only serve to cripple the USA ecconomy.  There's no informed NSA
or FBI that can believe otherwise because the other side does have all the
tools.  All they serve to achieve is to keep Joe Americancitizen Sixpack
away from his privacy, and Nancy Cryptowriter from her bread and butter.
What a wonderful law!  Don't you just love it?
Ah, yet another repeat of the same tired credo you've pushed on this list for days now.  I've heard it, and okay, whatever.  But it's not the issue, and irrelevant to this discussion.
Are you for or against the removal of the ITAR in regards to crypto? ITARs
are not key escrow, though perhaps just as or almost as evil.

But it is - it's a pain in the ass, but you can always revoke your own key and generate a new one, then sign everyone's keys whom you've signed as trusted, EXCEPT the one you wish to revoke.
Ah, but first you have to build yourself a reputation before you can live

Probably the best system is one that is in the middle.... that is say a message comes into a remailer targetting a user whom the remailer hasn't seen before, the remailer needs to make a decision as to whether to discard the message or deliver it.
While the idea to either ROT13 the message or PGP it or somesuch sounds like a good one, it doesn't prevent spam-your-enemy's-mailbox attacks.  Imagine 10,000,000 messages sent through remailers to your mailbhox, each ROT13'ed with a notice at the top stating "Wana read this? Un ROT13 it!" Very bad.  However, what this is trying to do is quite honorable.
Here's what I propose:
Finger the target user and see if there's a universal token in his finger
info (.plan file) that say looks like "::*ACCEPT ANONYMOUS EMAIL*::" or
"::*REJECT ANONYMOUS EMAIL*::" or some such...  If we can get all
remailers to do this and respect finger info then there is no issue. One flaw in this is that some systems (my isp, dorsai, included) shut off the finger daemon for security reasons.  In this case, the remailer should store the anonymous message on its hard drive for upto a week and send a notice message to the target asking them if they want to receive the email or not, and how to deal with future anonymous requests  The remailer then has to keep a table of those recipients for whom finger fails.
This is also an issue for shitty ISP's such as AOL or CI$ whom will not allow finger info because they don't run a cool unix service. :^)
While this is going to eat up a bit of space on the remailer, space could be limited for the user, etc.  If the space on the server runs out, what do you do?  The remailer should still inform the target, but again a policy question rises - does the remailer send the message anyway, does it delete the message but inform the target that "Sorry dude, you had an anonymous email, but I had no room to store it and so I delted it.  IF you don't want it delted the next time around, activate finger tags thusly, or send a reply to this message with "Accept Anonymous Email" or "Reject Anonymous Email" as the subject and I'll respect your wishes from now on"???
If a target's finger info does not fail but fails to produce a remailer accet/reject tag, there's a question of policy: does the remailer go ahead and send the message and adds a heading to the message informing the user how to set accept/reject in their finger info, or does it act as if the user's finger server is disabled?
Another thought is that we could set up some universal remailer allow fingering service where the remailers can use some server somewhere or a list of servers somewhere to look up a user's email address and see if they are willing to receive anonymous email.  Sort of like PGP key servers.
Or we could have a DNS like service of email addresses between all remailers which should propagate their tables to each other of the exceptions and whether or not they wish to receive anonymous email...
This setup also allows a potential anonymous person to see whether or not their target accepts anonymous messages before they bother writing a long rant to them about what a nice person they are, and what to shove where. :)
This also solves the question or rather wishes of the mailing list or usenet group owners who may not wish to accept anonymous posts, such as alt.uptight.assholes.at.some.org but allows them to be posted on something like alt.whistleblowers, alt.sex-victims or whatever. :)
Is this enough food for thought?
