@_subject: Intelligent source? 
Please point to a strictly natural process that creates infoormation. What evidence is there that infoormation, such as that in DNA, could ever assemble itself? What about the 4,000 books of coded infoormation that are in a tiny part of each of your 100 trillion cells? If astronomers received an intelligent signal from some distant galaxy, most people would conclude that it came from an intelligent source. Why then doesn't the vast infoormation sequence in the DNA molecule of just a bacteria also imply an intelligent source?
