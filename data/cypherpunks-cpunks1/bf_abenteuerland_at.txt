OnionCat ( is getting more stable and we successfully ported it to several OSes, most notably WindowsXP. Unfortunately we still lag behind with documentation but we have tasks to enhance this Currently it seems to run stable on and was explicitly ported to
(*) Windows XP (Cygwin)
(*) Linux
(*) OpenBSD
(*) FreeBSD
(*) MacOSX
For Windows we are working on an installation package, for installation from source have a look at Ubuntu package is ready ( Debian package is under construction. The debuild sources already exists within the svn tree.
OnionCat is checked in into OpenBSD ports tree -- unfortunately exactly that revision segfaults but an update will follow after release of OpenBSD 4.5.
On FreeBSD it will be checked in soon and also a MacOSX package will follow.
The Solaris port is already under construction.
Additional development is undertaken to build a special adapter (Socks5) for I2P. This will make OC run with Tor and I2P.
For further information have a look at  . Don't hesitate to contact me personally or register to our mailinglist ocat-talk at cypherpunk.at (ocat-talk-subscribe at cypherpunk.at).
