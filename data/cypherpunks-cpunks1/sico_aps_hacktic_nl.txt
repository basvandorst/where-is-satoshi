That's a big problem with PGP, so before you go experimenting first backup your
key. When I tried editing an aka on mine (my email address had changed) I lost
other people's signatures on my key. :-(

Right, that's the point indeed.

But here I disagree. Should one wish to use PGP to assert something *other*
than that a certain PGP public key really belongs to someone, then write a
message and sign *that*. I'm not sure if I really understand you here, your
phrasing ("people's identifiers") is a bit unclear.

Lovely, however can anyone tell me where to ftp for a FAQ or something on the
subject? I'm not unfamiliar with the theory, but I miss some practical
information, not having joined this list until recently.
As a side note, it was actually Detweiler's rants in some newsgroups that made
me aware of the existance of this list. ;-)

Yes, well, uh... If they already have all that information, would it *not* be
wonderful if they suggested what your return could look like? I know that *I*
really hate it everytime some agency (including income tax folk) sends me a
pile of forms that I have to fill in with information they mostly already have.
Or am I missing something?

Do you realise that not everyone on the list (or should I say: not everyone

Allright, I'm off now to install my client. ;-)

I don't like to read this list and see that many posts are about the political
problems with ITAR, patents and copyrights. Actually, I'm just a simple
software type, so I'm glad I read somewhere (here?) that the source to PGP 2.6
will be released, so that we can correct any problems introduced in it for
political reasons.
As to not being allowed to have or use 2.6 in Europe, what makes you think so?
I may be wrong, but I thought the only obstacle was that it may not be exported
to us due to ITAR. Once it's available here there's nothing wrong with having
or using it. I've seen PGP 2.5 flowing through European wires, so I think that
2.6 will come here too (if it hasn't come already).
Which makes this whole mess with ITAR, patents, copyrights and US and maybe
Canada only ftp sites even more difficult to understand for an outsider like
me. What's the point of all this, if cyberspace knows no borders? What are MIT
and RSA up to? Should this be discussed in alt.conspiracy? ;-)
I humbly admit that I'm clueless...
