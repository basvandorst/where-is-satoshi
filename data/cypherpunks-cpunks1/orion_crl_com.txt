Hm... it seems to me, that if the government is going to have these keys, it won't be too long before they are all posted to the net... considering how good the .gov and .mil is at keeping secrets, we shouldn't woory :)

I agree... IRC is much too limited compared to the bast virtual realities of MOOs, and IRC is also much more unrealible... we have IRC for about 12 hours a day, simply because the server for IRC keeps killing itself :(

@_subject: UNSUSCRIBE README 
I think that this should be clarified: you UNSUBSCRIBE to sypherpunks-requests (right?)
Not that I don't like filling my mail box with lots of messages titled UNSUBSCRIBE or anything... ;)

@_subject: Making unsubscribes easier 
Wouldn't it just be easier to make it so you post to cypherpunks-requests at toad.com and unsub and all that to cypherpunks at toad.com?

@_subject: 4th ammendment and Cryptography 
as all the books on World War ][ coding and code breaking.  There are about 10 million of these films and books around...
citeable sources?  Although I understand only a little of the technical side of the discussions, it sounds like they know what they are doing :)

@_subject: CLIPPER CHIP ON LIMBAUGH 
Just to make sure you all know, good 'ol rush can be contacted at:
70277.2502 at compuserve.com
I've written him a couple letters capping on clipper, and although I don't know weather he really learned from what I said, but he did mention the next day that he 'recently learned' that the majority of the net-users themselves oppose clipper... just a note.
