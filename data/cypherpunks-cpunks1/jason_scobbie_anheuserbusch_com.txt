I can attest to the ignorance of the govt. of DC.  Having spent 18
months in Arlington (US ARMY), I have seen many acts of total ignorance
by the govt.  One can only speculate on not only how Marion Berry has
regained his power, but to what extent some one has to go before being
banded not only a criminal but also no longer welcome in the public
