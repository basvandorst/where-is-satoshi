@_subject: SPA's Press Release 
After researching the SPA's lawsuit for awhile, I figured I might as well post the SPA's press release regarding their lawsuit against C2 to see if it'll spur some more discussion on it.  If it weren't for the seriousness of the matter, I would almost be amused by the SPA's lawsuit.  Their term, "contributory infringement" is almost like suing the bartender because a customer got into a wreck while drunk.  Note the "should have nown." Here's their specification for this, copied from "Anyone who knows or should have known that he or she is assisting, inducing or materially contributing to infringement of any of the exclusive rights by another person is liable for contributor infringement. "
ie -
     posting of serial numbers      posting of cracker utilities      linking to FTP sites were software may be unlawfully obtained      informing others of FTP sites were software may be unlawfully obtained      aiding others in locating or using unauthorized software      supporting sites upon which the above information may be obtained      allowing sites where the above information may be obtained to exist on a       server Then there's their Vicarious Liability for Infringement by Another Person, outlined by:
"Anyone who has the authority and ability to control another person who infringes any of the exclusive rights and who derives a financial benefit therefrom, is vicariously liable for the infringement of another person."
ie -
     ISPs who have warez or pirate sites on their system      ISPs who have pirates for customers      sys admins for newsgroups or IRC where pirate activity takes place It's interesting to note that this web page is entitled "Theories of Copyright Infringement", and the only listing (which I didn't copy) which references a law (section 501(a) of the Copyright Act, to be exact) is direct infringement

@_subject: Snake-Oil FAQ 
Not only that, but you're also looking at a potential lawsuit, unless such a list were compiled and managed through the use of a nymserver.  Since there's no way, within reasonable limits, that a cryptogrpahic program can be proven bad, then a lawsuit is inevitable.  I could potentially see a list of products which have "methods which have been proven ineffective in securing data against determined attacks" such as DES, etc., but otherwise, it's just begging for trouble.
