@_subject: LPC for speech 
Did you know that using LPC (linear predictive coding) on speech can
near-telephone quality at only 8 k BITs/second?  With a signficant
decrease in quality (but still very understandable... probably better
than radio) you can get the rate down to 2kbps.  If you don't mind
sounding like a speak&spell, you can go to 600bps or less.
Using LPC, you could send real-time voice over the
internet.  It would even work (maybe just barely) over a SLIP
connection.  According to my professor, LPC can be implemented
in a simple DSP chip, so I figure a 486 ought to be able to
handle it, too.  Sound like an interesting (granted maybe not
too useful) project?  It would be a way of providing secure
voice communications -- LPC code the speech, encrypt the data
stream, transmit via v.32bis modem, etc.
