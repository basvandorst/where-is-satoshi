My understanding is that Win '95 installs its winsock.dll in
install their winsock.dll. As their .dll is replaced by MS's, they cease to
function (either correctly or at all). The problem is resolved by
re-installing the original winsock.dll or configuring the Internet software
to look elsewhere for it.

Alice de 'nonymous wrote..
Ahhh.... this sort of thinking really lets the user down.
The reason Netscape (et. al) has market capitalisation is because they sell
their product to us, the users. It is a bit of a worry if software authors
can write and then release for sale "buggy" software, and hide safetly
behind "I make no warranties etc."
To adopt an analogy... would you be happy to buy a car from Toyota (or
whoever) if they were allowed to hide behind a warranty disclaiming
liability should it break down (or blow up)?
Somewhere along the lines, those who make their money selling software
should have to be responsible for bugs.

@_subject: The Solution: 20 Beautiful women 
Fellow Cypherpunks,
Maths was never my strong point, but this response (from my statistician
g/f) sounds convincing...but then, maybe I'm biased :)
According to your friendly neighbourhood statistician (ie me) the answer can be
deterined as follows:
Suppose we have 20 beautiful women and we call them W1, W2 through to W20.  For
any given women, say Wi where 1<=i<=20, we have only two choices, choosing her
or rejecting her.  Knowing that she's beautiful anyway, we assume that:
Probability(Choosing Wi)=Probability(Rejecting Wi)=0.5
Now, let Wn where 1<=n<=20 be the most beautiful woman, then the probability of
getting the most beautiful woman is:
Probability(Getting Wn)
        =Probability(Rejecting W1) * Probability(Rejecting W2) *
                Probability(Rejecting W3) * ... * Probability(Rejecting Wn-1) *
                Probability(Choosing Wn)
        =(0.5)^(n-1) * (0.5)
        =(0.5)^n
Now we know that the value for a fraction raised to any of the valid values of n
(defined above to be 1<=n<=20) can be maximised by minimising the power to which
the fraction is raised.  So we take the minimum possible value of n, namely n=1.
Thus Probability(Getting Wn)=(0.5)^n=0.5.  This gives us the highest chance of
choosing the most beautiful woman.
This could have been done more intuitively and less rigorously by considering
the fact that when we multiply any fraction by another fraction, it always
becomes a smaller fraction (and hence our probability is reduced).
So you can see there is a moral in this story, can you not?
I pat myself on the head.  I am extremely brilliant.
She who is most luscious

Howdy from Australia.
I am in the process of doing some research for an
article on our present bandwidth difficulties in As a side issue, I wanted to cover the "overhead"
factor inherent in the TCP/IP (v4?) protocol which I understand is reduced under the proposed IPv.6 protocol.
I'd also like to discuss the "unfriendly" manner in which
web browsers such as Netscape hog resources by sending multiple
port access requests.
Can anyone point me towards recent papers which deal with these

@_subject: US calls for measures against Internet porn 
Perhaps it is a result of many self-interested parties who have hyped the
Internet to the hilt, but it never ceases to amaze me how people think
that as soon as you connect a PC to the Internet, suddenly, all this information
and computer wizardry _leaps_ down the phone line and _jumps_ out of your
It can be clearly demonstrated (even to US politicians) that the Internet
is not a passive media - users must go out and find what they are looking
for (especially pornography). You cannot "stumble" upon pornography,
as you might by, say, channel surfing on cable.
You can't tell me that someone who fires up their Web browser and points it
to  or clicks yes to a request that they acknowledge
that they are over 18/21/majority and agree to access adult material doesn't
know what they are getting themselves into...

I guess one thing politicians should consider _real_ hard is whether they
want the Internet to be ruled by the lowest common denominator
(so to speak).
If the US (or Germany etc.) wants to impose it's version of morality/PC
then it really doesn't have any grounds to complain when other countries
decided to do so.

Well, doesn't this beg the question - the "desire" by people to own them
is not as a result of advertising, but the fact that society has long fixed them as standard units of "currency".
If all those centuries ago marble was decided upon as a central unit of currency, we'd all be killing ourselves to get some, not because
of any aestetic beauty.

I was just testing out some new search software, and polled Alta Vista to
see how it all worked. I used "sex" as my search term, and Alta Vista
reported that their were "no documents matching - sex ignored"!
Interestingly enough it will let you search with other, sex-related terms
(such as "nude", "f*ck" etc), but not sex!
Very bizarre indeed.
