Not an argument, of course -- also, would you be more specific? You
appear to resemble remarks made by Paul Krugman in Slate a few years
       So why does the supply-side idea keep on resurfacing?
       Probably because of two key attributes that it shares with
       certain other doctrines, like belief in the gold standard:
       It appeals to the prejudices of extremely rich men, and it
       offers self-esteem to the intellectually insecure.
       The support of rich men is not a small matter. Despite its
       centrality to political debate, economic research is a very
       low-budget affair. The entire annual economics budget at the
       National Science foundation is less than $20 million. What
       this means is that even a handful of wealthy cranks can
       support an impressive-looking array of think tanks, research
       institutes, foundations, and so on devoted to promoting an
       economic doctrine they like. (The role of a few key funders,
       like the Coors and Olin Foundations, in building an
       intellectual facade for late 20th-century conservatism is a
       story that somebody needs to write.) The economists these
       institutions can attract are not exactly the best and the
       brightest. Supply-side troubadour Jude Wanniski has lately
       been reduced to employing followers of Lyndon LaRouche. But
       who needs brilliant, or even competent, researchers when you
       already know all the answers?
Why should this impress us? Do you always break things down into left &
right? Ralph Nader & Pat Buchanan can't /both/ be wrong about trade, can
they? Oh, my.
Fyi, Phill has opposed the MS antitrust case.
Assuming we're suspicious of spending our money & our time, would you
provide links to articles?

My point is that they ARE both wrong about trade despite a) being associated with opposite poles of the political spectrum; &
b) largely agreeing with each other.
That is, citing the agreement of leftists is no proof a conservative is

I'd like to believe this -- it would make the struggle more heroic --
but I can't. As they say, all politics is local. I don't think most
people in the Middle East care whether Americans are enjoying freedom &
democracy any more than most Americans care whether people in the Middle
East are (alas!). If they were really upset about capitalism they'd be
bombing Swiss banks; instead, they probably keep their money in them.
In fact, when was the last time terrorists struck Switzerland?*

Oy. Reminds me of an old joke: If timing were everything, the Swiss
would be funny.
