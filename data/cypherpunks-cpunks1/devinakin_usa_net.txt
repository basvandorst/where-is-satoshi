Dear Sir,
I would like to request a copy of the crack files for Windows 95 and WFW "pwl" files if you have them.� I am a network engineer and I'm doing some small-time network security for a couple of clients.� I would like to show them just how vulnerable their network is to even the simplest of file utilities.� Thanks in advance for any help you might provide.
