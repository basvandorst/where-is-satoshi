@_subject: CreditCard info 
There are businesses that are just as clueless.  I work for a mailing company that gets credit card orders from a telemarketing firm.  All of the information that I would need to commit major credit card fraud flows across my computer every morning.  (I actaully do the processing via computer to the bank.  The bank program was written in Microsoft Basic by someone in California.)  The company I work for wanted to print ALL of the credit card information on the packslips.  This means that anyone along the production line could have taken that information and done with it what he/she will.  The information is not stored in any sort of encrypted form on the computer.  Anyone who has access to the system and the least amount of knowlege could get to it.
Now you know why I do not have any credit cards.

In my opinion what helped to contribute to this assumption was the downreving of RSAREF from 2.0 in PGP 2.5 to 1.0 in PGP 2.6.  (That with the "expiration date" seemed to make things look pretty evil.)

The nature of control freaks is that they ignore the actual costs of their actions.  Is the government actually concerned with the true costs of installing monitoring devices into every phone switch in the country?  Do they really think of the financial costs associated every little decision designed to control our lives?  The true concern is *POWER*.  How they can get it, how they can keep it, and how they can extend their grasp into more and more of your/mine/everyone's lives.

But it is also the case that industrial countries, when they fall on hard times tend to fall back on an authoritarian "bread and circuses" approach to governing.  Fascism in 1930's Germany was one such govenment.  The current government was unable to deal with the financial and social problems and so reactionary elements were able to seize control of the government and impose their own brand of totalitarianism.  (Remember that Hitler was elected.) I think that this country is ripe for such a movement.  We have a number of groups that are ripe for scapegoating.  We have the economic conditions (although this seems to be changing for the better...).  We have the control freaks just wating to gain the power and more waiting in the wings.  They have the money and they have the technology.  And they have a population that is willing to give up alsmost any right to gain "security".
Don't be too smug yet...  There are people in power who have not figured out that totalitarian states cannot survive.  (They also do not seem to care about the long run.)  All they are concerned about is making people follow their rules under their conditions.  Logic and reason have nothing to do with the "thought patterns" of these people.  Besides, it is not their money they are spending on this.  It is yours.
As far as I have been able to determine, the only thing that you can do with a control freak is to kill him before he obtains any position of power.  (Or wrap him in duct tape and feed him lots of Thorazine(tm).)

Well someone has to say it...
"I am glad to see that Jim Clark is no longer hocking up GAK."
I just hope Netscape does not get seduced by the dark side of the feds and
impliment GAK "because they have to".  It is one thing to have cryptography
that is brute forcable in a few weeks, it is another to have a secret key
that some nosey government agent use to decrypt it in seconds.  If Netscape
impliments GAK I will move to something else because I will not be able to
trust that some other nasty surprise will exist in the software.  (As well
as having no real security left in the product.)
Do I beleive that Netscape will impliment GAK in the near future?  Not
really.  Not unless they go through another purge like the one back in
February(?), but I do not see that as being very likely.  (With the current
IPO, news of a employee purge would probibly drive down the stock and that
would be the last thing the top brass would want.)

Well, this is getting real unpleasant...  So far we have at least three
distinct flame threads going on and all of them are being pretty fucking
I am gpoing to address a few issues concerning this just to get them off my
chest and then I am going to drop the issue.
Alice and the Net Scrooge thread:
I agree that Netscape owes a bit more to people who help them out, but some
of your statements come from so far into left field that they are suffering
from lack of oxygen.  Where does AT&T come into the break of SSL and
Netscape?  AT&T may licence Netscape, but they do not own it.  As a licence,
I cannot see how they would bear any financial responsibility for fixes,
breaks or other security breaches.  The only reason I can see for the anger
directed against them is because they are a big company.  Still, your
arguments do not follow.
As for Netscape...  They have been trying pretty damn hard to clean up their
act.  They are actually FIXING bugs that are being reported and not just
forwarding them to Dave Null.  This is an incredible improvement over past
versions.  I think the IPO has had a positive effect becuase now they have
to act like a real company and have real quality control.  This is a good
thing!  Hopefully they will keep up the good work on bug fixes.  (We will
see if they have yet fixed the HP4 print header bug in 2.0b4 though...)
The Anti-Jeff/Matt/AT&T/Netscape thread:
People are not a wholly owned subsidiary of their company.  I judge people
by their actions and not who they work for.  Jeff Weinstien has worked
pretty hard to get things done right within Netscape.  That is not an easy
feat.  (I know this from experience.)  He may sound defensive at times, but
who would not after some of the shit he has to take from idiots who have no
clue as to what it takes to get things done in a corporate environment.  So
far he seems to be doing a pretty damn good job for Netscape and the crypto
community at large.
As for Matt Blaze.  He has done more for the crypto community as a whole
that most anyone I can name.  His accomplisments are pretty impresive.
Anyone who can break Clipper and describe the break in just eight pages
deseves a bit more credit than the anon-twits give him credit for. (Plus CFS
and the various other crypto code he maintains and distributes.)
So far the attacks on Jeff and Matt as being somehow corrupt seem more to
weaken any efforts this list has and not to help them.
Fred Cohen:
You have no respect for the freedom or opinions of others.  You expect the
net to operate under your terms and under your rules.  You want people to be
"responsible".  From what I have read here that seems to mean "punishable".
I do not like some of flames I have seen, but I do not threated legal action
against them. You have.  I have meet the keeper of the list.  He is a very
nice guy and i would not want to see him go through hardship because of some
whacko with a faschist control complex.
Fred -- Go somewhere else.  I suggest you get together with Dan Gannon and
his ilk.  I think you will find him more to your liking.  (Or maybe the
$cientologists.  They are into sueing anyone who disagrees with them. I am
sure they will help you start a list with your control fetishes in mind.
Maybe you can borrow a few of their lawyers.)
BTW, Fred has been killfiled on my mailreader. I am sick of listening to the
twit.  To understand what an honor this is...  He is the only person I have
killfiled on this or any mailinglist.
Sorry to inject this much noise to the list.  I am pretty damn hot over the
amount of shit I have waded through in the last few days.  The legal threats
from Fred were the final straw.  If toad.com ever needs financial support
fighting legal battles from twits such as Fred, they will have my support!
I know Perry will find all of this off topic.  It probibly is...  It just
needed to be said due to my own peace of mind.

I remember back during one of the previous FAA panics over terrorism.  I was
at the Portland airport discussing the measures with an FAA inspector.  He
explained why they had to have all the searches and stuff to stop anyone
from blowing up the plane.  I pointed out to him that if anyone wanted to do
that, they would just lay off a line of mortars from the hills overlooking
the airport across the river.  He got very quiet and very worried...
You cannot stop someone who is determined to do terrorist acts.  And the
more the government stomps down on descent, the more various groups will get
pissed off and perform terrorist acts, which will cause them to crack down
even harder.  (And on and on and on.)  They forget that the imposition of
order increases the escalation of chaos.
What does this have to do with crypto?  Not a whole lot, other than it will
be one of the first thing to be outlawed in the futile attempt to stomp out
unauthorized communications.  Gotta watch the proles every minute...

@_subject: Netscape question transformed 
I think that the main reason people have problems with the testing offer on
the beta is the lack of responses to bugs in the past.  I have seen many
complaints from people on the net complaining that bugs they had reported in
.90 had continued on into new and continued versions.  That if they recieved
a message back from Netscape it was just an infobot, and a rather hostilly
worded one at that.  (The infobot has been lightened up a great deal.)
Netscape has never had the staff to properly respond to the mail volume they
have recieved.  They have been trying to improve this but it is difficult to
man such a project with people who are able to sort through the piles of
dreck to find those people reporting serious problems.  (Also, the bug
rewards are only for "serious bugs".  Who defines what is serious and what
is not.  I know of a couple that have been hanging around for a couple of
versions now.  Maybe I should test if they got fixed with 2.0b1.  Probibly
not.  They only hit a handful of people.)
Netscape is still a pretty new company.  Some seem to forget that .90 was
only released about a year ago.  How long does it take to get a proper QC
department in place?  (After the shakeup in February(?) when the new
President was hired, I would have thought it would have been done then.  Now
I am not so sure...)  I know of at least one product that went out the door
in recient months that was not properly tested.  (The stack and dialer used
with Netscape PE comes to mind.)  I realize that sales sometimes forces
things to be released before its time, but there has to be some basic
controls for quality control.  (I will not mention some of the bigger gaffes
with 1.0 and 1.1 since not all of those were publicized.  A few simple
things could have caught them before they went out the door.)
I want to see Netscape succeed, but when you hear about things like product
being released on the net without warning those people responsible for
supporting it, bug reports being ignored so a ship date can be made, and the
like, it makes you really wonder.  I am finding problems with 2.0b1 that
could have been found just by using the product for a couple of days!  Most
of the problems I have seen with Netscape could be solved with better
communications between departments within the company and some strong
testing procedures.
Somethings are real simple.  Things like giving it to a handful of people
and letting them use it for a couple of days before you release it to the
rest of the world.  90% of the bugs will be pointed out through having
someone beat on it as they would any other peice of software.  And those
people should be someone other than the programmers.  (Sometimes you get too
close to the code to really stress it properly.)
I agree that you need to have a beta program.  Not everything can be tested.
But QC is important.  This is not Uncle Jim's pet project anymore...
All of this has been brought up on the net before.  Sometimes it seems like
the responses are more defensive than trying to find out the real problems
and fix them.  So far, you have been one of the few who has pushed for
getting some of these things fixed in a timely manner.  (I can name a few
others as well.  They seem to get burned out after a while though...)
I think my biggest questions right now are: "Is there a formal testing
procedure for product that is about to go out the door?  Is there a real QC
department and do they have the power to stop releases if significant
problems are found?"

@_subject: cryptography eliminates lawyers? 
"Fill that lawyer with a few more slugs of encryption!"
The argument that encryption will free us from all the legal ills of the
world is pretty specious.  If anything it will make more work for lawyers as
the non-clue-endowed portion of the world tries to come to terms with the
new technology.  They will make rules and subsets of rules and exeptions to
rules and variations to interpetations of rules that will make the current
set look like the rules to "chutes and ladders".  Part of the job of the
lawyer class is to guarentee the existance of work for other lawyers (as
well as themselves).  It does not depend on what the medium of exchange is.
Lawyers and government forces will try and figure out some way to try and
extract it from you.
The government is trying very hard to keep any scrap of power from creeping
away from them.  You can bet that they will try every thing they can think
of, rational and irrational, to regulate and control the wilds of
cyberspace.  They will pump up every imaginary boogieman to help them get
the public to swallow what they are fed.  By the time they figure out they
have been had, it will be too late.  Cypherpunks must be the syrup of ipecac
to the governments dose of poison to the body politic!  (I need to start
drinking more coffee in the morning.  I cannot believe I wrote that...)
Unfortunatly the public does not thrive on logic.  They had been trained to
react emotionally to things and not react logically.  I am not certain what
can be used to get them to realize why they need encryption.  Dispelling the
bogeymen is none need. The other thing is that the tools need to be made as
simple as possible.  The current tools for use require a fair bit of
technical understanding.  Until they have an integrated front-end that makes
it about as easy to use as America On-Line, encryption will not gain
widespread usage.  This is the type of code that needs to be written.
Making integrated tools like newsreaders and mail programs that support
strong encryption directly is what is needed for widespread use.  (As well
as being usable programs in and of themselves.  Many of the programs for
news and mail are crap.)  Making cryptography a "cool and fun thing to use"
will help dispell many of the myths and may help to defuse the government
created bogey men.  (Of course they will claim that it aids "criminals and
terrorists", but to them EVERYONE is a criminal and a terrorist.)

The Netscape "personal edition" was available in Europe on some store
shelves soon after it's release.  (The PE edition of netscape has the 128
bit encryption.)
As for what Netscape will do in this case...  They had made plans to release
the 128 bit version in a method similar to what MIT uses, but they found
that they could actually get people to buy a copy if they kept that one as
only available by ordering it.  (Who says that people will not pay for
encryption?)  Now all they need to do is come out with a version with a
bigger key. (Hint, hint...)
I will keep my personal feelings about Netscape to a minimum here.  There
are certain things that they do well and there are others they do not.  But
those problems will continue to be forwarded to Dave Null... Well, on to more profitable things.

I watched the local news coverage of that case.  The report was given by an
individual who has made that mistake before.  (He hosts a "Town Hall"
program that exploits various subjects of the day.  He was corrected as to
"AOL not being the Internet" during one of them.  I know, I was the one who
corrected him.)  The coverage showed lots of shots of the various internet
binaries echos (including alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children, but not
alt.binaries.pictures.cops.), the web including the Penthouse site (as if
Penthouse has kiddy porn), and other unrelated and non-AOL pictures.
The Internet has become the new scapegoat of choice.  The general media
cannot (or is unwilling) to distinguish the difference between electronic
nets.  The Internet is a generic term for them and since when is the media
willing to look beyond the surface?
How does this connect to crypto?  Well, aiding and abetting in a scapegoat
is a capitol crime in this country.  You can be assured that the Department
of Scapegoat Management will link kiddy porn and crypto at some point in the
minds of the generic public. Hopefully that perception can be "headed off at
the pass".  Having cryptography as a means of avoiding crime and criminals
in the perception of the public is a good idea.  The question is how to get
that perception into the minds of the general public before the other meme
can be inplanted by Scapegoat management and the other TLAa? I think the six-dot-three filenames has something to do with it...

Then they go on about how every school in the country needs to be connected
to the net...
I am wondering where they got the idea that the net is someplece they want
their children to be.  They don't let them play in distant parks inhabited
by scary old men and drunks, yet they want them to play on the "information
Superhighway".  The CDA types seem to view the net the same way that they view TV in the
classrooms.  They expect it to be as easy to control as well.  Get them all
staring at the box and they will quiet down and do as they are told.  What
these people do not seem to understand is what is going to happen when their
kids are exposed to the diverse opinions present on the net.  Forget the porno...  What are the parents who believe in Creationism going
to do when little Johnny runs into a good skeptical site debunking all that
crap?  What are they going to do when the little liberal kids are exposed to
the works of conservitives?  Or Biblical Inerentists kidlets are exposed to
the debunkings of that faith?  Or Dorthy Denning's kids (if she has any) get
exposed to the writings of the subversive known as Tim May?
The CDA proponents want the ideas presented to their kids be controled ones.
The existance of freedom on the net is a threat to that control.  Porno is
used as the (net)scapegoat, but there are far more threatening ideas out
there to that kind of mindset.  They just know that if they tell you their
true goals, then people will not go along with them.
If you want to know their real fears, read the stuff they write for the
"faithful".  It is far more revealing.  ("Remember: It is not a conspiracy
if you can subscribe to their newsletter.")
When reading Lovecraft, i always wondered what could be written down that

The cosmic is too far removed for most people to understand.  I have always
thought that instead, it described how the world worked and the driving
motivations behind it, with the firm understanding that there was not a damn
thing you could do to stop it.  The understanding that the world is driven
by the forces of ignorance and stupidity is enough to drive you to the

Jim is unwilling to admit his errors, even in things he has little or no
training in.  (I remember him claiming at one point that he was not a
programmer or did any coding for that matter.  Why he continues to persist
in such things I will not speculate on...)
I have worked on a couple of machines (that are still in use today) that
were non-standard bit sizes.  Many of the legacy machines from the old
mainframe days (about 20+ years ago) had non-standard bit sizes.  (Which
made communication between then an interesting mess.)  The old Microdata
PICK machines had a weird byte size, for example.  Some of the old Vax
machines had the same "difficulty".
Making the assumption as to the stability of the sizes of bytes, words, and
characters can get you into alot of trouble in the coding world.
Characters are a good case in point.  Depending on your OS and/or language,
you could be talking about 5, 7, 8 or more bits.  With the need to
distribute applications internationally, the need to support all sorts of
character schemes makes it even more variable.  Unicode is 16 bytes per
character.  Shift JIS can be variable.  (Either 8 or 16, if I remember
correctly.)  It just depends on the hardware, software, and compiler being
used.  I am sure that alot of old code is getting broken by the assumption
that a character is always 8 bits.  Assuming the same about bytes on old
machines will do about as much good.
And the standards change.  I expect that at some point, some standards group
will change all the terms again.  (And this argument will flare up again...)

I am sure that the lawyers on the list will correct me on this if I am wrong
here... The way I read this ruling is that it would have not effect on the
laws on releasing viruses in code. (i.e. putting a virus into an executable
and letting it go out to infect the world.) What it would permit would be
publication of virus source and information about viruses.
Publication of information about viruses (including source code) has a
useful purpose.  How can people write anti-virus programs if they do not
know how they work?  If publication of techniques is stopped, the anti-virus
people have to wait until they find a live copy before writing something to
detect and/or remove the offending code.  The virus writers are going to do
this whether or not they can publish.  Letting them brag makes them faster
to stop.
The "let them brag" principle also works with system hacks.  Finding what
techniques are used will let you plug holes that you may not know about.  It
is better to have information than not.
On to another [rant]...
I have been seening a surprising amount of rant from the forces of
Government about keeping information out of "the hands of terrorists".  I am
wondering how this is going to be brought about.  The books are there.  They
can be ordered from a number of mail order firms.  They can also be found in
used book stores across the country.  The information is alos on the net, on
cd-roms and other mediums of storage.  How are they going to stuff the
tentacles back into the can?
Without imposing a very represive police state, they cannot.  It would
require sifting through all of the available data (books, magazines,
libraries, etc.) and removing all "offending" information.  Since weapons
are so easy to make, they would have to remove knowlege relating to a wide
variety of fields.  Not possible without alot of cops and alot of guns.  The
results would not be pretty.
The thing I have not determined is whether they understand the outcome of
the ideas they are wanting to implement.  A good case could be made either
way for cluelessness or totalitarian mindsets.  I am beginning to think it
is a bit of both...

I the long run, I think that they are making the problem worse.
My theory as to the causes of disorder and "terrorism" have to do with a
general distrust and disrespect for laws and governments.  I see this as
being caused by having laws and governments that are hard to respect.
Even without conspiracy theories, what we know that the government of the US
has done to its own citizens is pretty scary.  Between the releasing of
radiation on humans near Hanford "just to see what would happen", the
misdeads of the FBI with Hoover and his cronies, support of various
dictators, and on and on and on, the people are getting more and more
distrustful of what they are told.  Mix that with a War on Unauthorized
Molecules that gets more extereme and more bizzare every day, law
enforcement that seems to be more concerned with issues unconnected with any
principles relating to justice, and lawmakers who are totally disconnected
from the things that are making laws about.
These things tend to generate an attitude of "Every being for themselves!".
Why not try to grab a bit under the table when your leaders are doing
likewise on a bigger scale?  Or try to overthrow a system that looks more
and more oppresive?
The forces of "Law and Order" and the forces of "Chaos and Dissent" seem (to
me) to be feeding off the actions of each other.  Where it will end is
anyones guess.  I can imagine that it probibly not be very fun for the rest
of us.

I believe the reason the Tacoma ordinance is getting so much flack is that
they are wanting to charge sales tax on all transactions that take place
from ISPs in Tacoma.
This type of taxation is not new.  Various jurisdictions have tried to use
the same thing on mail order houses.  Having worked for a service bureau
that dealt with mail order, I know what a hassle it is to try to keep track
of such taxation.  There is a company that will sell you the data of all of
the sales tax rates throughout the country.  This includes every little
podunk city, county, and fire district tax.  They are divided by zip code,
but that is no guarantees that you have the right place. The reality is that
trying to "be legal" under such regulations is next to impossible, even with
the proper data.  I know of few mail order firms that are willing to go to
that extreme.  (Unless, of course, they have gotten the proper threats from
some miffed tax baron.)

Well, I can think of a few reasons to come to that conclusion.  - Schlafly is the head of one of the more right-wing organizations in the
country.  - She is very closly associated with the Buchanon campaign and the Christian
coalition.  - Her organization, the Eagle Forum, distributes a couple of anti-porn rant
tracts (
called _Pornography's Victims $4.95 (paperback) by Schlafly, ed._ and
_Pornography Addict (Bundy Interview)_.  (Quoting Bundy is interesting in
this context, because he never collected porn, he collected cheerleading
magazines.  His "death bed confession" was a ploy to gain publicity and
sympathy out of a gulible ant-porn zealot.)
I know that he is gay.  His mother seems to have had some problems coming to
terms with the implications of alot of her rhetoric involving such things...
(She seems to confuse her religion with reality on this point.)
I would say there are alot of reasons to assume that Schlafly would try and
impose her morality on the rest of the country if given half the chance.
Look at the people she chooses to associate with.

@_subject: Schlafly on crypto 
Actually, i have found that it does not matter which side you choose, right
or left, they desire free speech for themselves and not for others.
I am not certain about Buchanan, but i do know that the Christian coalition
is very much in favor of net censorship.  Actually, I can find no statements
in either direction on the Eagle Forum web site. Do you know of any statements by Schlafly and/or the Eagle forum either for
or against net censorship?  I know of none for, and the circumstantial
evidence available does not reinforce the conclusion that she is against it.
I have yet to see anyone who publishes anti-porn screeds based off of the
Bundy case that does not support censorship of such materials.  Can you
point me to any?  Or any material that would lend credence to the argument
that she supports freedom for anyone except "Good God-Fearing Christians"?
Lon Mabon also claims to "hate the sin and love the sinner".  It does not
prevent him from dredging up as much hate as possible for those who are gay.
Actually my beliefs are based opon statements she made at the time.  You may
have more information on the subject than I do...  Without evidence to back up your claims, I cannot make any judgement than
what I have made.  Her associations with people who believe in censorship
and her devotion to a branch of Christianity that supports censorship, as
well as her sales of publications used to justify censorship makes me
believe that she follows that course.  Without specific examples that show
that she does not believe in such measures, I have no reason to assume any
other conclusion.
Has she published against net censorship?  The quoted article was about
wiretapping.  My search of her web site did not reveal any articles on that
topic.  If you have specific pointers I would like to see them.
But Jesus did not try to get the prostitutes and tax collectors elected to
high office...  (But then again, there are no contemporary records for the
existence of such a being in the first place.)
Actually I view this as a fallacy.  Just because the Christian Right opposes
Clinton for good reasons, does not make them friends for causes that I view
as just.
Lets also not accept them just because they oppose the current threat.  I
believe they have a number of threats of their own.
I do not disagree with the Eagle Forum on everything.  (I have just read
enough of her early works to make me consider her a danger to herself and
others...  Especially her screeds on Communism.)  She has some points I
consider valid on education and other areas.  But just because he makes
sense in some areas does not mean that I will trust either her or any of her
minions in any position of power.  Control freaks of either stripe worry me...
If they are willing to fight against the Clintonocracy, then i will be glad
to see it.  Just do not expect me to be willing to swallow their religious
beliefs as an alternative.
If you have pointers to material that shows that she is against net
censorship, then post pointers.  I would like to see them.  The posted
article does not address the net at all, other than as communication on a
one to one basis.  It does not address the issues of those who post
unencoded messages to the public at large.  Until I have text that shows
otherwise, i have little data to show that she supports freedom of speech
other than on a one to one basis.

@_subject: [rant] Re: Spamming (Good or Bad?) 
It is a mild term compared to some of the things that could be said about sales.
I have dealt with far too many sales people.  Few of them knew anything
about the products that they were selling.  (This is especially true of the
computer field.  "Do you know the difference between a computer salesman and
a car salesman?  The car salesman knows how to drive.")
Many people have a bad view of sales.  Mine is because of the times I have had to create the programs that sales
had promised, but had no clue as to what could and could not be done, or was
even practical.  Getting time lines set by people who have no clue as to how
long it will take or even if what they want is possible.  (More than once I
have received requests based on the pipe dreams of some idiot in sales that
contained contradictory requirements and/or absurd time lines.)
Most sales people do not care about what it takes to do something, all they
care about is making the sale.  What they tell the rube in the course of
selling it does not matter.  (Someone else will take care of it.)
But then, rarely does truth enter into the matter of sales...
Sales people have a bad reputation for a very good reason.  If they actually
had a basic understanding of what they were selling, and were not so
untrustworthy as to not commit to things that are not deliverable, they
would have that reputation.
The only people I have more contempt for than salesmen are salesmen for
multi-level companies.  (Except maybe government officials, but that is on a
case by case basis...)
"Never underestimate the power of human stupidity."
The biggest problem I have had with spammers in the last month or so are the
ones who insist on forging e-mail reply addresses.  Of course, being from a
sales background, they were too incompetent to cover up their tracks.
(Remember:  If you are going to post spam with a forged return address,
DON'T do it from your own uucp address.  The send path makes a great big
arrow pointing back to you.)
Spammers are more like the people who call you at home and try to sell you
things you do not want over the phone with recorded messages.
Sales on the Internet can be done and done without pissing off people.  But
what it takes is a shred of a clue.  By violating netiquite, the spammer has
shown that he lacks vital connection to anything resembling a clueserver.
Furthermore, much of what is spammed is either illegal (variants on the
"make money fast" idea of pyramid scheme) and/or posted to entire
hierarchies of groups.  (Most mail readers will not allow you to mark a
message as read in all of the newsgroups it is posted to.  And most of the
Windows newsreader do not have killfiles or they are buggy to the point of
unusability.)  I certainly do not want to read this crap over and over again.  It is this repeated abuse that gets spammers mailbombed, feeds killed, etc. (And I will not even go into the type of sales promoted by Canter and Siegal
in their book on Internet sales.  Of course, considering their background

@_subject: [noise] Re: Charter of PDX Cpunk meetings 
I think an explanation for this is due.  Jim is going to move his complaints here instead of dealing with them with me no matter what I do...
A bit of history here...
I had seem Jim Bell's postings and had not thought too much about them one way or another.  I felt that some people had been a bit too hard on him, but did not care one way or another.
I organized a physical meeting on Jan 20th at a public coffee house in portland.  Jim showed up.  During this meeting he espoused some ideas which I found very bothersome because they sounded far too much like "magical thinking" and pseudo science.  I did not challenge him about them at the meeting and tried to move on  to other things.
A while ago an anonymous poster made a number of comments about Jim Bell's beliefs involving assassination politics.  He brought up a number of valid points.  Jim ignored all of those points and flamed him on something totally without substance.  (Not signing messages and not using an identifiable This bothered me. I responded to the post.  A good portion of this message was flame, but it contained a number of questions about the workability of Jim's pet theories.
Jim's response to this was to question the validity of the post, but not deal with any of the substance of the arguments.  (He was questioning it because I did not sign the posting.)  I ignored the post as I had other things occupying my time...
During the period of time between the meeting and the offending post I had created a pdx-cypherpunks list.  I had a number of people who were interested and it seemed like a good idea at the time...
Well, i posted on the list a question about the next meeting and mentioned about  the results from the key signing.  (I had three people, who i did not mention by name, who had not signed keys or gotten back to me on it.)  I relieved a response from Jim about my messages to him here and why he had not signed anyone's keys.  [For those who are interested, I can forward the original messages.  They are interesting reading, in an odd sort of way...]  It came down to him complaining about my messages on national list.  He still did not address any of the issues I had raised (he still has not), but was pretty pissed.
A number of the other people on the list took him to task on a number of the comments he made.  It grew into a pretty hot flame war on the list.  After I started to get complaints and it prevented anything useful being posted, I posted a message to take the discussion to e-mail or I would start banning people from the list.  Jim ignored that request and I removed him from the That is why it has moved back here.
This will be my last response to Jim's rantings in public.  i will be glad to deal with questions in e-mail.  I have sent a number of responses to Jim already in e-mail and he has ignored them.  He has made veiled threats to me on the pdx list and has shown no sign of wanting to deal with this in a rational manner.
The issue comes down to this.  Jim Bell has a number of ideas i disagree with.  I have challenged him on some of those ideas.  He is unwilling to answer any questions as to the flaws in his beliefs.  Instead, he takes any questioning of his ideas as personal attacks.  I refuse to give any respect to an individual who presents his ideas to the world and yet is unwilling to defend them in public (or in private).
I suggest you get your killfiles ready.  I will be killfileing Mr. Bell's comments on this list as it does not belong here.
The following is the last I will say publically on the matter.
to Well, lets see...  The claim that you have a method of "rendering a building uninhabitable by electronic equipment for at least 30 days".  The claims that the Portland meeting was a "private meeting".  That I did not inform people of that fact.  That I somehow owe you an apology for statements which you seem to be unwilling to deal with.  I am sure that i can dig up more.
That is because you are not willing to debate.  You want your beliefs accepted with no proof and no rational thought.  You want them to be accepted without question.
What behavior was that Jim?  I told people about your loonie scheme to "disable hardware"?  If you did not want it known, then you should have kept your mouth shut!  (The first rule of not being seen is DON'T STAND UP!)  You seemed to have some sort of idea that it was a private meeting.  Nowhere was it stated that it was private.  We were in a crowded coffee house.  You were sitting in front of a big glass window.  Anyone who wanted to take the time to hear you could have.
There was no reasonable expectation of privacy at that meeting.
I am sorry that you have suffered embarrassment.  Grow up.
I gave my justification.  You are unwilling to respond to criticism of your ideas.  You still are.  Sorry, but you need to grow an epidermal layer.
I did not sign my messages to him.  He assumed that it must be some sort of spoof.  I left it unanswered for two reasons.  At the time i was not really needing a confrontation (as my personal life was taking time) and I was not certain how to answer.  (How do you answer someone who is THAT paranoid?)  I wonder if he assumes Tim May's messages are all spoofs.  (He may have something there...)
Did not answer mail...
Jim is not willing to deal with the issues i keep bringing up so i must be And I banned Jim from the Portland list...
I was flaming you for being unwilling to clarify your positions.  You made extraordinary claims and have been unwilling to explain how any of this is supposed to work or given anyone any sort of reason as to why we should believe you.
Yeah, that one is my fault.  i should have responded sooner to that message. No.  You were at fault for ignoring every issue that was brought up.  You have been unwilling to deal with anything resembling substance and instead insist on continuing this petty flame war.
i.e. the rest of the Portland list jumped on his case for his behavior.  Many of them are my friends.  At least one of them is someone i have only met once.  You seem unwilling to accept that maybe the idea that no one has sided with you is that they do not agree with you.
As I have stated before, the concept of identity is a slippery thing.  Actually the information on the key signing that I posted, and the theories behind it, were from the FAQ written by Derek Atkins.
You have one legitimate complaint.  (That I did not respond to mail in a timely fashion.)  Sorry...  Guilty.
The rest you have blown FAR out of proportion.
You are mad because i said some unpleasant things to you on a list where you so much want to be respected.  I suspect that you had lost the respect of most of them before I posted.  If they are that easily swayed, then you have not done alot to earn their respect and be able to keep it.
You have failed to respond to the mail I have sent in private.  That makes me suspect that you do not want to resolve the issue with me, but cause problems for me with others as "punishment" for exposing your outlandish views.  I am sorry that you feel that you have to go to such extremes.  It reinforces my decision to bounce you from the Portland list however.
The more you rant, the less I am willing to deal with you.  When my daughter acts like you she is sent to her room.  In your case, I will just have to ignore you...

Most backup software has an "encryption" option, but I have seen few that

I see this as a product that corporations should be demanding.  It is
difficult to walk off with a computer, but a dat tape can be slipped in a
pocket with little notice.  If it happens to be of a server or important
system, valuable information would be in the hands of whoever could decrypt
it.  (And off site alot of resources could be thrown at decrypting the
data.) Weak or no encryption of backups could be a potential problem with
the security of a business.  (Of course, if you leave tapes lying around,
you are asking for trouble anyways...)
Might be an idea for a product there...  (And you can bet law enforcement
would throw a hissy fit about its existence.)

Parents had that ability before.  Cable boxes have a "perental control key"
on the side that enables them to lock out "offensive" channels.  It works
quite well and is fairly hard for the kidlets to defeat.  (I used it to
lockout the religious stations and home shopping channels.)
The "V-Chip" debate is a mirror of the one that occured when the cable
channels were starting to become popular.  There was a big hue and cry about
kids getting to the "naughty" channels without parent concent.  Seems most
people do not even learn how the lockouts work.  (And are too lazy to learn.)
You have to remember that most of the people arguing for TV filters are
looking for a way to make the "offensive" stuff go away for good.  (Either
from some sort of rating system or a heavy handed FCC regulation or two.)
And don't believe that the V-Chip will let you choose the rating service.
It will be one centrally produced rating from some faceless and nameless
entity.  I am willing to bet that we will see some pretty absurd examples of
ratings (mild things getting heavy ratings above and beyond the call of
sanity) in the future.
The v-chip will be less than useful as a real filter tool for those of us
who have a different worldview than the censors.

This proposal bothers me. I do not see any positive results from this
proposal. (Or at least the negatives will far outweigh the positive.)
Here is what I see as the results of such a plan...
Getting an IP address will become prohibitivly expensive except for the
largest megacorps.  Instead of solving the limitations of the current
system, this plan will cause people to "invest" in IP addresses in the hope
that the price will go up.  IP addresses will become part of a corporation's
invenstment portfolio.  This will result in less usage of IP addresses, not
more.  The Internet is a fully complient buzzword.  People will buy IP
addresses becuase it is "the cool thing to do" and they can make a quick buck.
I wonder if "used" addresses will get less money on the "open market" than
"unused" addresses.  If that is the case, then the you will see huge blocks
of addresses go unused so as to not spoil their "market value".
All in all, I see it as a bad idea...
"Ever have a problem getting an IP address from your local ISP?  YOU WILL!
And the poeple to bring it to you? AT&T!"

@_subject: Cluelessness V.S. Lack of Knowledge 
In the snake oil controversy, I see a couple of issues...
There are some people/companies out there who have the attitude
that they have some sort of "remarkable achievement in the
field of cryptography".  In fact, it is SO remarkable that they
do not have to submit to any sort of peer review or examination
by people with more skill in the field than themselves.  Some
of this can be explained by being too close to the problem to
see any of the flaws.  Most of it can be attributed to ego.
These people are pretty much hopeless.  They can be a great
source of entertainment and/or flame fest practice, but rarely
do they ever learn by their mistakes.  Their ego gets in the
way far to often.  (IPG Sales (any relation to "Soupy"?) is a
prime example of this.)
There are companies out there that are trying to build good
products.  These people can be instructed on the ways of
implementing good crypto.  Unfortunately, I have seen a number
of them pushed up against the "Wall of Attitude" when they do
ask for help.  Cypherpunks, for good or for bad, have a
reputation for being experts in the field.  People come here to
ask questions because "Cypherpunks know what Good Crypto tastes
like".  What is happening though is that they are also getting
a reputation as people who flame first and give answers later,
if ever.  This is not a "good thing".  If you want strong
crypto to exist, you have to make the people who are trying to
put it into place able to understand what it is in the first
place.  Giving them grief when they try to find out the flaws
in the ideas (and are willing to learn) is not helpful to the
community as a whole.
I know of one developer who is trying to implement a strong
cryptosystem in his app.  He is unwilling to post his
questions/concerns here because he is afraid of getting his ass
shot off on the first query.  Judging by some of the responses
I have seen, I do not blame him!  I can understand intolerance
of the sales droids who push crap.  I do not have much
tolerance for them either.  It bothers me when I see people who
are not experts in the field AND ARE TRYING TO LEARN getting
"blowed up real good" because they are not experts.
Cypherpunks not only need to teach, they need to be willing to

My experience so far has not been very positive.
I have tried both of the betas on Win95.  Neither of the betas have been
able to get past the "Synchronising keys" section of the setup.  The program
just keeps accessing my public keyring for almost 30 mins before it returns
a cryptic error 111.
What I have seen of it, I am not very happy with some of the design choices.
You should be able to tell it the hex id of the key that you want to use
with the mailer.  Nope!  It tries to find what it thinks the key should be
based on your e-mail address.  Since I have two keys under that address,
there is a wee bit of a problem.  I have tried generating a new one as well,
and i still get the problems with the key sync.  (As in it not completing
and ending with an obscure error message.)  So far, my last message to the
beta address has gone unanswered on this problem.
I would like to test it further, but getting that far has not been very easy
at this stage of the development.  Not a hopeful sign.

I have done a couple of searches and have come up fairly dry.
The Cyphernomicon has a couple of paragraphs, but nothing on
techniques or pointers to other references.  RSA's FAQ has
little to nothing as well. A web search turned up little
useful. Most of the other references I have found have been for
current cyphers, but next to nothing about breaking them. I have been recommended "The Codebreakers" by Kahn.  (I will be
picking that up as soon as I can find a copy.)  I have "Applied
Cryptography".  (It is not oriented towards the breaking of
cyphers, but it has some good remarks on the weaknesses of
those listed.) Are there others?  I would prefer electronic
references, but hardcopy text is useful as well.  Most of what
I have found in the crypto field for books has been remarkably
bad (with a few notable exceptions). (It is hard to respect a
book when the code is written in BASIC...)

I use Eudora as well.  It is not as easy as I would like.  You have a couple
of options:
1)  Use cut-and-paste into Private Idaho.  Private Idaho will allow you to
paste back into Eudora.  (Or you can send out from Private Idaho directly.)
This option is useful becuase it supports nyms and chaining of remailers.
2)  Get one of the standard Windows PGP shells and paste into that.  After
signing, you will have to repaste into Eudora again.
These seem to be the only options.  I am not certain if there is a standard
DDE or OLE interface that could be used to feed message information back and
forth between Eudora and some other app.  There have been a number of
promises of Eudora/PGP integration, but nothing has materialized yet.

Here is the final(?) information on the Portland Cypherpunks meeting.
Time:           5:23pm (discordian time)
Location:       The Habit Internet Cafe
                2633 S.E. 21st Av., Portland OR 97202
                SE 21st @ Clinton in Portland, OR
                (503)235-5321
For more information on the location, visit:
 We will be having a key signing and other activities, as well as general
socializing.  Bring information on projects you are pursuing or questions you
would like to ask.
Please leave your cameras and other photographic equiptment at home as some
of the people attending are pretty camera shy.  (And not shy about informing
you of it...)
It looks like we will be getting people outside of the Portland metro area
attending as well.  (I have heard from at least one person from the Bay area and one from Seattle, so who knows how many will show up.)
If you want to be on the information list for this, just send me e-mail at

I know Bruce and his problem is quite real.  I happened to have the three keys
that he is wanting to revoke in my keyring.  (And one of them he had forgotten
he had made at all.)  It would be nice if there was a way to use the "web of
trust" to certify a key revokation in the same way that one signs a key.
Basically get a couple of your friends who are accepted in the crypto community
and have them vouch for the actual loss of the key(s).  It would certainly help
patch the problem.  (It might open up things for spoofing anyways.  There would
have to be a way of overriding such a thing with the real key, but that would
require the passphrase.  (Which should be available if not lost.)) An idea at

@_subject: Windows Eudora and PGP 
I use Aegis right now and I have only one major problem with it.  It does
not have a facility to do word wraps in the program before signing.  This
means that if you use it with Eudora and word wrap is on, all of your sigs
are going to be bad.  (And hitting return on every line before feeding it
through is a pain in the ass.)
On the other hand, I have heard that WPGP is not very stable under Win95.
Can't win for losing...

take it at attack).  There are times when you want multiple keys with the same ID.  I have two
key sizes becuase one is an older key.  I keep it around for use with people
who are using versions that do not support the larger keys.  (I have run
into this once from a sometimes user of PGP.  He finally upgraded.)  To
aleviate the suspicion, I have the two keys sign each other.
Only if you use the name to refer to the key and not the hex ID.  (I found
out the hard way that some front ends use either the last key created or
whatever they feel like for signing keys and/or signing messages.  I am
still trying to straighten out some of the weird results of that.)
Fortunatly, some programs will use the hex ID to refer to the key so there
is no confusion.
ever to this found for the tried it, Revocations are supported, but they require the passphrase.  (I have a
number of revokations on my keyring from various folks.)  The problem here
is occasions where you have forgotten the passphrase.  (I have an old
keyring that I need to go and revoke all of the old keys on it.  I have not
used them in a year or two.  I doubt if they are even on the keyserver...)
Eventually there will be a way of revoking keys in the circumstance.
Something similar to a notary (or a combination of notaries) who can vouch
and say "hey, this guy really did lose his keys".

@_subject: A couple of ideas for PGP-based programs 
I am posting these ideas here before I annoy the people who will probibly
implement them just to see if they have much merit...  (If this is incoherent
it is because of the late night posting, but I want to get it done while the
thoughts are still there...)  Maybe some of this will occur after PGP 3.0 is
released.  (That is, if the universe has not cooled down into a small lump of
coal before then...)
1) Something I would like to see on the keyservers for PGP is a way of retreving all of the key revokations since x date without having to get all of
the keys since that date.  I hate having to check each key every so often to see if it is revoked.  It would make it alot easier to avoid using compromised
or old unused keys.
2)  I would like to see a program like private Idaho have the ability to send
mail to the key server and grab all of the "unknown signator" keys.  This would
have the interesting effect of building a more complete keyring, while using the "web of trust" to weed out alot of the bogus keys that tend to crop up on
the key servers.  After n number of itenerations you would have more of the
"important keys" and the ones that have little or no signage would be left to
grab when needed.  This would avoid the need to grab the entire key database.
(In fact, it would make it desirable NOT to...)
More later when I am not so tired...

@_subject: "trust management" vs. "certified identity" 
How many people ask for "proof of Identity" from their friends?  Not very
many, I can bet...   (Maybe the excesivly paranoid.)
Things like this can complicate depending on your social circles.  For those
involved in the SCA (Society for Creative Anacrnyms) or Science Fiction
conventions people may or may not go under a host of names.  You may or may
not know their "true" name.
There are people who i have known for many years who are good friends and
yet I do not know their "real" name.  (And I am not really concerned about
not knowing that name.)  Some people I know by multiple names. (Makes
conversations interesting when the nyms change every few sentences...)  What
matters is the continuity of the individual, not what nym they happen to be
using at any given point.  (The net makes this alot more complex though, as
you usually do not have visual contact with the people you are responding
to... Individuals are harder to forge than e-mail.)
The criteria I use as to whether I can "trust" a source is based on a number
of factors.  Have they given reliable information in the past?  Does the
information corilate with other information from reliable sources?  Does
their attitude get in the way of the information provided?  (Sometimes it
takes heavy filters to discern fact from opinion or just a pissy
attitude...) What gains my respect is similar, but also based on their
general attitude and how they treat people.  (Of course there is not cert
mechanism for a "web of respect".) [examples cliped]
I find the idea that a little card "proves" my identity a bizarre form of
mystisism.  (Especially when that "proof" can suddenly expire or be revoked
by the whims of the State.)
As has been said before, one of the main reasons for the Government's (and
others) desire for "true names" is so those that offend them can be punished. Government paperwork proves that "they" know who you are and have some sort
of hooks into your persona.  (taxation, legal, and/or otherwise.)  This is,
of course, if it is "real" identification and not forged by a competing
"I don't have any papers.  All I got is a pipe!"

@_subject: A couple of ideas for PGP-based programs 
This is about what I do now.  I am writing a perl program that splits the
requests up into seperate mail messages and dumps them out to the mail
program dujour.
True, but I hate seeing keys with 40 signatures on it and all of them read
"Unknown Signator".  (I am expecting someone to use "Unknown Signator" or
"Key revoked" as a nym any day now.)
Very good point!  I was actually talking about the "incredibly bogus keys
that stopped living and take up valuable keyserver space".  Keys with names
like "Wow! This is neat! I think I will create 3-4 keys a day!!!!!".  (I
actually wound up retrieving a key like this.  They are pretty annoying...)
I like that idea alot!  That way you can retrieve keys signed by people you
trust.  (Would this be the "Web of Guilt by Association"?)  It might have a
downside or two...  (Privacy for key signers?  Job seekers denied a job
because they signed the key of a known member of the four horsemen? "Are you
or have you ever been a key signer for Tim May or one of his Tentacles?")

I have seen this before in a number of companies...  I think it is becuase
alot of management is trained to think of things in the positive.  To try
and put the best spin on any situation...  On the other hand, people of a
technical bent tend to think of things as problems to be solved.  Such an
outlook is seen as negative.  The two outlooks seem to conflict on many
levels. Such outlooks from management tend to delay resolution of problems
until it is too late...

It has been requested that cameras not be brought to the meeting
as some who are planning on attending would like to avoid having
their soul captured by the evil magic of the lens.
If you are planning on participating in the key signing (and you
do not have to if you do not want to), please follow these
Send a copy of your public key (ascii armored) to
alano at teleport.com.  (This will also help me determine how many
people are planning on attending.) I will compile all of the keys into a keyring which will be
handed out on diskette.  (Please tell me the format you want the
disk in.  Nothing too exotic, (like IBM mainframe formats and the like) please.)  I can also e-mail the keyring to you as well.
I will hand out a list of the fingerprints of the keys on the
keyring.  At the meeting we will verify key fingerprints. When
you get home, you can then sign the keys at your leisure and mail them back to me.  I will then send them to the key servers
and the participants of the keysigning.

What is needed is a method to make e-cash more like how someone would
purchace a money order.  If the Mark Twain bank pitched their services to
places that sold money orders, then you could exchange cash for e-cash with
assured anonymity.  A small fee could be charged (like it is with money
orders) and everyone would be happy.
It would at least introduce alot more people to e-cash...

softice and other debugger-type software) will show some interesting things.
Hopefully such an action will reveal the backdoor.  After that point, just
publishing the hack will do more to remove the bogus gaking than any protest
will ever do...

The differences between the two are hype and Satan is free to anyone who can

Such tools are very useful for system admin types to fix holes and for

@_subject: Elitism on Cypherpunks 
I have seen a number of posts on "Cypherpunk Elitism".  I have seen more examples of it here on the list.
I think that this attitude will be more destructive to the list than noise in the long run.
It has been said that "Cypherpunks write code".  They must do more than that.  Cypherpunks need to teach.
All the cryptotools in the world are of no use if no one knows how to use them.  (Or know how to use them correctly.)  All of the protocols are of no use if no one knows how to impliment them correctly or WHY they need them in the first place.
There are alot of bogus security methods.  Many of them exist because people do not know better. Without someone to instruct them in the ways of these things, they will continue to go on with bad crypto, not knowing any better.
Not all of the non-cypherpunks are beyond hope.  Many of them are teachable.  If we leave them to flounder on their own, cryptography will be something used only by an elite.  It will be of little or no threat to the powers that be because only a small amount of people will have the ability to use it.  The TLAs will have less encrypted trafic to sort through.  They will have won a big battle, not through force of arms but force of egos.
What can be done?  Alot.
Teach people how to use PGP.  Help them generate keys.  Help them get them signed.  Show them how to use remailers.  Teach them the secret of nyms.  Friends teach friends how to use crypto.
Adopt a BBS.  They may be young, but they may also become the cypherpunks of tommorow.  Upload current versions of programs.  Keep them current.  Organize keysignings on the board.  Host crypto discussions.  Help stamp out the misinformation that breeds on such systems.
Instilling the interest in the field and teaching will do more for the cause than all of the "this is noise" postings in the world.  Helping those who have questions will help the newbies no longer be newbies.
There are some on the list who have already taken this tact and must be commended.  There are others who have taken the "fuck you" attitude to anyone they do not find worthy opon first contact.  Bad attitudes are counter productive.
To prevent the fall of a new dark ages, we must make sure that the information is spread far and wide.  I think the statement that descibes it best is:
           "UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of             this IMPORTANT information is ENCOURAGED."
There is alot that cypherpunks can do to encourage the use of cryptography by "the common man".  Elitism is not one of them.  In the long run it will be counterproductive.  And maybe in the short run as well...

@_subject: [local] Report onPortland Cpunks meeting 
The physical Cypherpunks meeting in Portland occured on the 20th of January.
No big name Cypherpunks we involved in the manufacture of this meeting.
(Well, maybe next time...)
It pretty much went like a first meeting...  We had about 11 people or so
attend.  (Hard to tell in a coffee shop if people are attending or just
wondering what the heck is going on.)
The participation from the group was very positive.  Those who did attend
were quite willing to participate.  Those of you who did not show up missed
a good meeting... and free coffee drinks from the Habit.  (The Habit
Internet Cafe was having their one year aniversary and was giving away free
coffe as part of the event.)
Some of the happenings (in no particular order):
Bruce Baugh handed out the information he has been collecting on remailer
timings and mail to new gateways.  The information was pretty useful.  He
had sent out a group of ten messages to each remailer through a nym server.
The results were at odds with the published times.  Certain sites either
dropped large percentages of messages or delivered them about 8-9 days late.
Others which were rated at the bottom of the list on the regular timing list
were the most reliable in Bruce's tests.
Neal McBurnett talked about his Java program that generates statistics on
the PGP "web of trust".  The information he gave was pretty surprising.
(Fewer keys exist in the keyservers than I believed.) I encoraged Neal to
post his findings to the list. (Hint! Hint!)  I will not try to explain the
stats from memory...
I gave a report on the status of the PGP 3.0 API.  (Of which Derek Atkins
was kind enough to send me for the meeting.  Thanks Derek!)
There was a key signing.  It was a bit rough as for many of us it was our
first key signing.  (I think Neal was the only person who had been to an
organized key signing.)  Still, it went fairly well.  Only a couple of
people brought their key fingerprints on disk instead of paper.  As of
today, I have only recieved signed keys back from a couple of people
though...  The next key signing will be done a bit differently.  (Live and
learn.)  There was also a suggestion for a nym signing at some point.
There was a discussion of entropy which devolved into entropy. The
definitions of entropy varied widely depending on the background of the
individuals involved.  (Or just general smartassedness...  My definition of
entropy was "A urilogical condition".)
There was alot of just general discussion of crypto and current events.  A
good time was had by all.  (At least I have not had any complaints.)
One of the other topics discussed was a Portland-Cypherpunks mailing list
for keeping people informed on local activities.  This will probibly be put
into place sometime soon...  There will also be upcoming meetings as I have
had a number of people inquiring about the posibility.
Well, that is about all I can remember at this point...  (At least with not
enough caffiene in me.)
Others who were there can probibly comment.

The things that I learned was that instructions should be sent to the
participants well in advance.  Key fingerprints should be brought on paper becuase it is not always assured
of having a computer there to read the disk. (We had a lap top that was
refusing to read disks effectivly.  We had to use on of the Habit's
computers.)  Distributing the keys on disk worked well.  (I also brought PGP and various
tools for those who did not have them.) With the key server there is still
an issue of verifying that the key is valid.  Best to have the key
fingerprint on paper, where it can be read to the group.
We also found that reading the first half of the fingerprint was more than
attiquite and saved a great deal of time.  (Which was later wasted on
getting keys off of disks.)
I will also be distributing batch files for those dos users who are not
familiar with how to sign keys and creating extra keyrings.
Most of the problems were procedural rather than technical.
It went well for a first run...

not interest me as much as the individuals involved.

That was the basic format we used.  The only difference was that the keys
were collected before hand and distributed on disk.
The biggest problems were due to unfamiliarity was to what to bring and
procedure from an experience point of view.  (Lack of key fingerprints were
a problem.)
The key signing rules were published, but many people attending did not read
them.  (They were part of an update announcement.  Many people read the top
part, saw nothing had changed and skipped the rest of it...)
Now that we have done it once, it will be alot easier the next time.

@_subject: Signing nyms' keys (Was: Report on Portland Cpunks...) 
This is a problem with the web of trust in general.  It is known as "Guilt
by Association".  Person X commits treasonable act A.  All of the persons who are signed on to
his key could be considered to be co-conspirators.  The same applies to
nyms.  The difficulty with prosecuting nyms is finding the link to the real
world individual.  Anyone associated with him/her/it will be considered to
be guilty by reason of key signage or a way of determining who the real
person is...
The only way I see getting around this is only signing nyms with nyms or
having some sort of zero knowlege proof on a key signing authority.
Something where you can issue some sort of proof to the signing authority
that you are who you say you are without giving any information about your
"real" identity.  I know of no foolproof way of doing this...
I guess we are stuck with the "Web of Guilt"...

[Not Perry(tm) approved -- Skip of this offends you]
I am waiting for someone to come out with a product that will modify the
v-ship (or the various internet "protection" tools) in such a way that it
scans *FOR* pornography.
Porn is big business.  You would think that people would pay for a way to
sort through all of that non-smuttiness and just "get to the good stuff".  I
also imagine that as soon as such a product appears, the censors will scream
bloody murder.
The purpose of all the ratings, and the filters and all the other stuff is
not to "protect kids".  It is to protect the prejudices of the adults.  They
do not want to see it anywhere in the world, not just inflicting some sort
of imaginary harm on their children.  I expect the first people to use the
"reversed filters" will be the kids themselves.  (Behind the parents back,
of course.)
I have known too many adults that believe that by restricting their kids
access to information, they can prevent them from growing up.  In these
parent's minds, such information is what makes them want to hump their
little brains out.  Biology has nothing to do with it in their limited way
of thinking.  Cluelessness does not just cover computers with these people.
It also covers any other topic that required more than two brain cells to
But censorship alone will not solve the problems that these people see in
the world.  They are afraid that somone, somewhere, is commiting "sin".
They will do what it takes to stamp out all this immorality, no matter who
gets hurt or what it takes.
A good description of what is next is at  .
You have to realize that these people are busybodies who believe that they
have the right to define what is right and what is wrong.  In order to
enforce these beliefs, they will need access to every means of communication
in existance.  Anything that prevents this enforcement will be seen as a
threat and thus must be banned.  Encryption will be one of the first things
to go.  Double entendres, sarcasm, and wordplay will be next.  Fiction
dealing with anything that would offend an eight year old (because that is
where they stopped their intelectual growth) must be stamped out as well.
More will follow as the demons appear in more and more forms.
And they will never succeed...  No matter how hard the censors have tried in
the past to outlaw "smut", it has always existed in one form or another.
All they do is drive it underground.  If they stamp out crypto, they will
just drive it underground.  And in the process they will have stamped any
freedoms you or I have underground as well...

Why is it that whenever I read Denning's pronouncements I feel like I am
reading something from a villainess in an Ayn Rand novel?  Denning has become the epitome of the pure authoritarian government world
view.  Analysis of her viewpoints makes me more of an anarchist every time I
read her rants.  It is that smarmy "We know better than you do" with
absolutely no rational argument as to why it is true.  It is people like
this that are generating such distrust in Government by promoting irrational
statism.  (Government by random fiat keeps a high employment for those who
make their living off of political parody, paranoia of the government, the
court system, lawyers and lawmakers, and anarchists everywhere.)
Depends on your ability to challenge the status quo.  A vague law with lots
of harsh but undefined penalties is much more effective than something that
is rigidly defined.  With rigidly defined laws, you can find loopholes and
ways to push the envelope.  With vague rules, people will tend to err on the
side of caution.

@_subject: Denning's misleading statements 
I wonder if the same justifications were used for the Inquisition.  "We have
to use these methods in order for the Church to remain effective."
Currently we have a whole host of laws that are difficult, if not impossible
to enforce.  The response from law enforcement is that we have to use
stronger and stronger enforcement methods to shore up laws that are by their
nature unenforcable.  How they expect to do this and remain in a non-police
state is beyond me.
I expect that such enforcement methods will be sold to us the same way that
they sell us soap and presidents.  The media will give us plenty of
"reasons" as to why we have to accept draconian methods to resolve problems
from undefined enemies.  Already we get the "real life" cop shows showing us
a whole host of "enemies" who need to be hauled off to jail and the news
programs showing us the scare story of the moment. Expect the four horsemen
to get closer and closer as the shacles are ready to be put into place.
Such enforcement is self-defeating in the long run.  It is based off the
false perception that the governed cannot recognise that these laws are
unenforcable. Continued enforcement of "unenforcable" laws increases the
disrespect for laws in general. ("The imposition of order equals the
escalation of disorder.")
The question is when the bulk of the population will see what is being
prepared for them...  Probibly after it is too late.

Jim, I used to take your postings at least semi-serious.  I ignored the ad

arguments.  I had difficulty with many of your ideas, but I have that
problem with many people so it was not a big deal...
Then I met you at the Portland Cypherpunks meeting. You blew whatever
credibility that you had with me at that time.
At that meeting you made claims that were fantastic and beyond belief.  You
gave no evidence to support those claims, just relying on some sort of
future "proof".  (Sorry, but the burden of proof in these sort of cases lies
on the claimant, not the rest of the audience.) Assassination politics is
immensely credible compared to your plan to disable electronic equipment.
(And that is saying alot.)
Assassination politics suffers from a number of problems.  The biggest being
its difficulty in being implemented.  Such a system would suffer from
Federal agents posing as hit men, outright fraud, and attempts to destroy
the system from within and without.  I have seen nothing that makes me
believe it could ever be put into place.  I have yet to see you address any
of the flaws without resulting to flames and rant.
Unfortunately, you would rather attack your critics than deal with the flaws
in your beliefs.
The following is an example... There are reasons why an individual would do that.  Maybe they did not want
to create a nym just to respond to one message.  Maybe they thought that you
would recognize their other nyms. Maybe it is someone you know.  Whatever
the reason, it does not diminish their arguments.
You think very highly of your arguments, but have shown nothing that would
make me believe that you could actually do that without resorting to ad
hominem attacks.  In fact the poster brings up some interesting questions
which you totally ignore, due to your unwavering belief in your pet theory.
All you do is flame him, instead of dealing with the immense flaws in that
Not all anarchists believe in killing others.  Sorry, but there are as many
variety of anarchy as there are anarchists.  As for the results of
"Assassination Politics", you have yet to show that it would produce any
results whatsoever, or if it is even possible to implement.  In fact, I
cannot see a way that it can be put into place without everyone involved
being put in jail.
Yet you never explain why it is valid to use evil to fight evil.  It is this
lack of willingness to discuss the details of your beliefs that make people
unwilling to take your ideas seriously.
Or not participating...  Jim, if annoying people were a qualification for
murder, you would need to watch your back pretty damn carefully.  But it is
not a qualification yet...
You have yet to show, however, how your plan could ever be enacted.  If it
was possible to enact, you would probably be in jail for "conspiracy to
commit murder" or some similar charge.  Anyone who assisted in such a plan
would also risk such charges.  The feds are pretty ruthless in ferreting out
people who try an hire hitmen.  Especially from private citizens. the only
people who are able to hire hitmen and get away with it are the heavily
funded or the government themselves.  Setting up an organization to compete
with these groups will not be viewed favorably.
This is not as easily defendable as self-defense.  If you were shooting the
politico yourself, then I might agree.  But you are not.  You are hiring
someone else to do your dirty work for you.  If you were actually helping
out in the slaughter, then i might have a bit more respect for your
argument.  As it is though, I find it about as toothless as those who eat
meat, but are too squeamish to go hunting themselves.
The digestibility of your plan has little relevance to its possible adoption...
Nope.  The poster is claiming that you are *TOO CLUELESS* to be an Agent
Provocateur.  You are missing the point.
I don't think you are any such thing.  I believe that you are convinced of
the rightness of your ideas and no amount of rational discourse will sway
you from that belief. Being a fanatic does not make you evil or an Agent
Provocateur.  It does make you less credible though...
You seem to miss the point that the poster was making, but no worry...
The above speaks for itself.  (I could say that this is one of the looniest

variety of law enforcement.)  They know what you believe and what you are
agitating for.  But you are not a threat because you are not credible.  No
one is going to adopt your ideas because every time you open your mouth, you
make yourself look like a loon.  Not only do you make yourself look like a
loon, but every organization and group you associate with looks bad.
If you really desire to make your views accepted, you need to look at how
you present yourself to others.  Willingness to analyze your own belief
structures and refine them is a first step. Ability to take criticism is a
second step.  Without that, your ideas will be taken as the views of an
unwavering fanatic.  You will not sway many people with fanaticism.
I think that you have little to nothing to say about being taken seriously.

The problem is getting PPP to work under DOS.  If your kid can do that, then
he will have no problem in disabling any sort of filtering, as well as
wiping the hard drive and installing Linux with X11R6.  DOS stacks are a
pain to get functioning, usually have little to no useful instructions, and
tend to be harder than hell to find.  (Or as Homer Simpson once said:
"Mmmmmm! Packet drivers!")
I expect to see a case where some kid gets in trouble for filtering out what
his parents can see, read, or hear.  Or sets the school filter to only allow
going to porno sites.
I find it humorous how many people think that they can use technology to
babysit their kids when the kids understand the technology much better than
they do in most cases...

Or even better yet, they could actually teach thier children to deal with
such information instead of sheltering them from it.
I have dealt with a number of parents who have the idea that they can filter
everything the kid hears or sees.  The type of intelectual and emotional
basketcases that result are not very plesant to interact with.  They tend to
go through alot of rough times when they have to go out into the world and
see a wide variety of views, instead of just seeing what mommy and daddy
want them to.  What happens from there is generally not very pretty or very
fun for the person involved.
I do not believe that these types of filters are good.  If you have that
much concern about what your child can see, then you should not give them
net access at all.  (And remember to also not to leave them at the library
where they might find just as much filth...)  "If you don't want your kids
to be hit by information, then don't let them play on the information
Without contradictoy viewpoints, children do not learn how to decern between
them.  They get indoctrinated into the idea that they must accept ideas as
they are fed to them.  That learning consists of taking what is provided and
not to go out and find those ideas which might be "harmful" or "dangerous"
without perental supervision.  What we are getting is a bunch of emotional
cripples who cannot handle anything intelectually sharper than a rubber
ball.  (And it must be a ball bigger than two inches in diameter, else they
might choke on it.)
With these sort of tools, we are conditioning our children that it is OK if
someone filters their information before they see it. (Without even knowing
the *KIND* of information being filtered, because even *THAT* level of
knowledge is harmful and/or proprietary.) That it is OK for some parental
figure to eliminate all the "nasty" and "awful" information before someone
can hurt themselves with it.  That itt is OK to prevent others from viewing
information to complex for their childlike minds.
We are becoming a nation of the babysat.  Anything that our nannys deem
harmful is hidden away in the bedrooms of the parental units.  And maybe it
is harmful.  They have to scan through it all day long and look what kind of
self-righous pricks they have become!
At least I am able to instill some sort of love of knowledge and exploration
into my daughter.  Hopefully it will stick before the control freaks in this
culture are able to knock it out of her...

This makes the situation even more scary, considering how little is known

If the purpose is for use with "Crack" or some similar program, it might be

will also get the words in common usage that do not appear in dictionaries.
(Such as fnord, jedi, killfile, and the like...)  You will also get alot of
proper names, which may have been used as passwords.  The idea is that words
in common usage may be more likely to be used as passwords.
Another thing to look for when choosing dictionaries/wordlists for crack is
not sticking to english.  If you have a userbase that is known to have a
certain percentage of people of a non-english background, you will want to
find lists of words from that background.  (I had a sysadmin asking me about
Yiddish and Hebrew wordlists for just that reason.)  These can be a bit
harder.  (Especially for unusual languages.)  But knowing your userbase can
make all the difference in what it might take to crack the passwords from
the outside.

remember such excuses being given during the Iran Contra hearings.  They
kept refering to "Country 1" and "Country 2", while the Pacifica commentator
was in the background telling you what each country was and who most of the

Prozac works on a different set of brain chemestry. (Prozac messes with the
seretonin level of the brain and how it is reabsorbed.)  There is a whole
series of chemicals similar to Prozac that are prescribed.  It takes a bit
to determine just which one is best for the person involved.  (I have far
too many friends on variations of those drugs.)  The reactions when they
come off them is quite "interesting".  Prozac is not a stimulant however.
(Not in the usual concept of a stimulant.)
"It is by caffiene alone I set my mind in motion.  It is by the beans of
Java that the thoughts acquire speed, the hands acquire shakes, the shakes
become a warning.  It is by caffiene alone I set my mind in motion."
You can build a resistance to caffiene.  (As well as one hell of an
addiction.)  So far I am up to a gram a day of the stuff.  Mix that with the
Seldane-Ds I take every morning (for hay fever) and you get more than a
small amount of stimulants.  (I have found that the Seldane-Ds have a
positive psychoactive effect as well.  They seem to allow me to focus
better.  Probibly because I am not sneezing.)
The long term effects of any stimulant is problbiy not very good.  What
needs to be looked at is what the long term benifits and risks are, for the
individual, not just for the society.  What these sorts of chemicals do to
small children 10-30 years down the road is pretty unknown at this point.
(If any of the things i have seen so far are any indication, they are not good.)
But then, I suspect the government of drugging our kids with school lunches
laced with lead paint, not with mind control drugs. (Lead paint is cheaper.) ]:>

Another thing to do is get more web sites containing information of interest
to people living in such regimes on SSL enabled web servers.  If the web
redirectors can be set to redirect SSL traffic undisturbed, then there is
another level of encryption for the chinese to have to hack through to find
"dissidents".  And if someone could sneak them a few copies (hint...
hint...) of the 128 bit version, it would make their lives even more difficult.
I see a point where the repressive regimes of the world are going to be
trying to prevent their people from getting to information that is against
the regime, but getting run over by the shear volume of the information.  It
may be possible to filter for such things, but in doing so, you destroy any
usefulness the network has in the first place.
Of course this is all a moot point, because it has been proven by computer
projections that all informative net traffic will be buried under
advertisements by the year 2000 anyways.  I expect some legislative body to
try and make money fast on the net by selling ad space on IP packet headers.

@_subject: Credit Card to eCash 
I find that interesting, since I can do the same thing with a bank machine.
(Or maybe it is only money laundering when you don't get your picture taken
as part of the process.)
The only problem I see is that charges to a credit card can be withdrawn by
the customer within a certain time period after either the billing or
transaction.  (I do not remember which.  It has been a year or two since I
have been responsible for CC transactions.)  The individual could always say
"It was not me" and get away with the e-cash.  Sounds like a BIG risk for
anyone setting up such a site.
That is the big problem with e-cash as it is...  Not everyone has a major
credit card.  Not everyone is willing to go through the hastles and invasion
of privacy involved to set up an account with an e-cash provider.
When getting e-cash is as easy as getting a money order, then there might be
more interest.

Denial?? Sarcasm perhaps...  No "denial" I could see.
As for your "evidence", it is pretty shaky.  Such as the part about not
having a drivers license.  Since when is government regulation of driving
proof of existence?  Why would they have to operate a dummy organization?  All they have to do is
get the names of the subscribers on this list.  Much more cost effective.
And not to forget all the free code that Blaze and Schneier have handed out
over the years.  Maybe that is a plot as well.  Maybe the typos in Applied
Cryptography are a secret conspiracy to weaken the cryptography of the
nation.  Next thing I expect you to say is that Queen Elisabeth is a drug
dealer and/or other LaRouche style rants.
I judge the above individuals by their deeds, not just by their words.  They
have accomplished much in the areas of preserving privacy and cryptography.
What have you done lately?
The voices in your head?  Actually, I have more interest in your motives
than his.
Interesting that you should bring up the FBI actions against dissenting
groups... Actually, your screeds read like some of the stuff the FBI sent to
the Black Panthers in the 60s and 70s. The screeds were written in the same
manner, by an anonymous source, to discredit others in the organization.
Your texts seem designed to cause mistrust amongst those who are willing to
fight for their own freedom.  (Especially amongst those who are not involved
in the middle of the fray.)
Your accusations are not accomplishing anything constructive.  I do not
believe that they were designed to either.  I believe that they were
designed to sow mistrust in the individuals who are making real progress
against the Government held position that they have the right to spy on our
every move.
So far, you have not given any proof as to why we should believe you.  Given
the vitriolic nature of your screeds, I see no reason to do so.

Unless they start using prosecutions similar to what they pulled back during
the Meese years with video distributors.  I am waiting for them to start
using RICO laws on sites carrying Usenet groups deemed "obscene".  RICO has
already been used in some juristictions for shutting down video stores (and
maybe even bookstores).  It is not over yet...
The control freaks will not be happy until everything you view and see has
previously been approved by some board or ministry.  (Or they at least have
some way of hurting you if you step out of line.)  Whether that control
freak behaviour is driven by religion, morality, "your own good", greed,
power or lust does not matter.  the results are pretty much that same.
But there is a social stigma surrounding porn.  Most people who look at porn
are not willing to admit it in front of friends and family.  many of the
more vocal opponnents to porn are the ones most attracted to it.  Look at
jimmy Swagart.  He crusaded against it for years.  Never stopped "Lonesome
Cowboy Jim" (5 point if you can name that album and artist) from wanking off
to it...
Depends where you go.  Most of the Usenet stuff is crap, but that is true of
any medium.  (It is called a medium becuase it is rarely well done. (Stolen
line...  Forget the original author.))  There are exceptions.  Usenet will
give you smut that may (or is) illegal in your area.  Some of this sort of
stuff can be mail ordered, but there is more risk.  (Like postal service
stings/entrapment and the like.)
There is much better quality available on the pay sites, but since you
usually have to pay to view any of it, you never know what is available
until you have forked out a bit of cash.  (I am surprised I have not seen
more sites using e-cash for this purpose...  Porn drove the VCR industry for
many years.  I expect the same for the web and e-cash.)
Most pay-for-porn sites are going for interactive video instead of java
and/or vrml.  (Yes, you can pay $$$ to duplicate the experience of a stroke
booth via the net.  All you lack is the resolution, the interaction, and the
requisite sleeze of the experience.  Dancers the size of postage stamps!  Wow!)
Might be interesting...  This is more evident in CD-ROMs though.
I think that was the cover of Spy magazine...
"Be a Great porn Actor at Home!"  Reenact bad plots, cheezy dialog, and bad
writing in the privacy of your living room!
Well, if it is something that will cause arousal in male humans (or computer
geeks), I am sure you can sell it.
Porn stories and/or hacked pictures of celebrities already occurs.  Has
since I have been on usenet...  (Many years now.)  One of my favorites
involves the Brady Bunch...  In fact there are celebrities who have hired
people to track down phoney pictures and get them pulled from web sites.
(I always expected something like this to show up on Star Trek:TNG.  Having

Bandwidth is the only thing preventing the smut from getting farther than it
already has.  The easiest way to kill a web server is put porn on it and
advertise.  All of the schemes coming out for "cool gee-whiz web extensions"

read it, seal it back up and put in back.  Mention small details of their

The genie is out of the bottle and has been for a while.  The tools are

cars as only useful for making getaways, he would be laughed out of the

Offer to sponsor a crypto archive and discussion area on a local BBS.  Keep
it current.  Get others interested.  Spread the tools and teach people how
to use them.
Build web sites that are pro-crypto.  Where possible, get them working under
SSL.  Are there any SSL crypto sites out there?  I know of only one, and it

obnoxious.  Most would just pay the bill.  (Leading to even more scams of

Thanks for the sources.  More money is going to get dumped into cryptobooks

few of the books at a local bookstore, but I was uncertain of their quality.
(They also had a number of snake-oil crypto books.)
The author has failed to call me back.  I do have some serious concerns
about the code.  (There is not a single XOR used, except to clear
registers!)  I am starting to suspect that it is based on a mathematical
progression based on the numbers 40, 28, 36.  I need to spend a bit of time
on the code with a debugger to find out just where that segment of code is
located.  (Should not take too long...  Just have to make the time.)
The web info for back issues listed a web page from a publisher that had no
listing for them on the server.  I will be sending mail to get more info...
Still an interesting topic...

They support a bill which is aimed at easing the restrictions for the uses

view the bills as having more positive effects than negative effects.
(Which may or may not be true...)
Sudden capslock stickage?
I think that you are infering evil intent where there is no evidence of
same.  The bill does have some major flaws, but it also has some major
advantages.  Being the cynic that I am, I think that the "use of crypto in a
crime" provisions are a big negative.  Others are not nearly as cynical however.
Posting in all caps will not help you convince people of the correctness of
your position.  Claiming conspiracys involving people who have better
reputations for supporting crypto than yourself will not help either.
If I were to charge people with complicity in conspiracy, yours would be one
of the first in line.  (Though a pretty lame one at that...  Trying to smear
people who have actual reputations with juvinile assertions and b1ff style
postings is not the way to win the hearts and minds of the Cypherpunks(tm).)
BTW, good luck in trying to boycott AT&T.  They own alot more than you can

@_subject: PGP : what to do when a user ID has multiple RSA keys 
You need to use the hex id of the key.  (I have this problem as well.)
To get the hex id of the key, try "pgp -kv ".  That will give
you the hex id (right after the key size). For example, if -kv returned:
you would use "0xF7D02799" instead of your name.  (No quotes and case does
not matter.)
This does have some Cypherpunks relevence...  Many of the PGP front-ends I
have seen do not use the key ID, and thus, do not pick the correct keys in
this curcumstance.  (And some use it for some, but not all, operations.)
But then, I would like to see key management handled alot differently than
it is now.  (For example, I would like to see PGP use multiple keyrings with
an order of precidence.  Search the most used keyring first and then check
the mega-keyring if nothing is found in the first one.  I expect that kind
of feature is a ways off...)

treating him differently than what he wanted to be treated.  (He felt that I
owed him some sort of "respect", something I lost for him when I met him in

he wanted to vent in public and get some sort of emotional satisfaction.
(Something I would guess he does not recieve in real life.)  Since that
time, he has taken every opertunity to slander me on this list.  (And, for
the most part, I ignore him.)  I have found that the best way to counter any idea that Jim has is to just
let him go on about it.  His lack of tact, his refusal to deal with any
argument against his closely held convictions, his habit of ad hominem
attacks with little or no information, and his general loonieness make any
ideas he may have easlly discardable as being from a certified crank.  (And
he does an even better job at it in person!)
I do find it quite humerous that he feels that I somehow have control over

After I posted about it, I did a little more digging and checked out the

surprised to see that the Personna cert generation saved the information off
in a text file, instead of using the bundled e-mail client.  The docs on
this process were pretty sketchy as well...)
My reasons for installing it had little to do with S-HTTP (but it was a nice
bonus) and more to do with the lack of table support.  (I needed something
to check out how pages would look on non-table supporting browsers.)
My concerns with S-HTTP are with the lack of server (and browser) software
support for it, as well as the difficulty of maintaining a site that uses
it.  (Having to change every single page on a site can become a bit of a
chore, as well as introduce unintended security holes due to in improperly
updated page.)

@_subject: Microsoft's "answer" to Java 
I recieved a copy of "Microsoft Interactive Developer" today in the mail.
In it, it has a preview of Microsoft Explorer 3.0. (Flux by David Boling on
page 120.)
Of interest to Cypherpunks is this paragraph (in the section on OLE support
in web browsers):
"Since OLE controls could potentially pose a security problem, Microsoft is
studying how to create an infrastructure to certify them.  The idea is that,
once certified, an OLE control would contain an RSA security signature
indicating that it has passed muster -- the OLE eqivelent if the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval! Users of Internet Explorer 3.0 could specify
whether or not noncertified OLE controls should be loaded and executed by
the browser."
As a web developer, I have some problems with this scheme.  Giving Microsoft
access to virtually every OLE control on the Web does not make me more
secure.  Sounds like a way to rip off ideas from the rest of the development
world.  If someone has a control that might compete with a Microsoft
product, it could be shelved and/or delayed for "further security testing".
Java has a decentralized mechanism for security.  No one group controls what
is a "certified" control and what is not.  You write the code and compile it
and that is that. Furthermore, you are not stuck with Microsoft approved
platforms.  (I wonder if there will ever be a version of Explorer for the Mac.)
I expect the Microsoft plan to garner a bit of resistance from the Web
development community over this one...
I do not expect to see many OLE crypto apps for the web with this plan.

I am glad to see this clarification on the signature policy.  (Sorry for the

number of points.  (Which is why I should not believe things written in one
page articles, but that is another point...) With the author's credentials,
I would have expected a wee bit more accuracy (or clarity).
I do have a number of comments on what you posted, however...
This is a good thing.  (This was clarified after I posted by a developer who
had returned from an MS developers conference on Internet Apps.) It is also
nice to see that there will be more than one option of signing services.
Hopefully the policies will not be such as to shut out the small,
independant web designers/developers.
Actually it protects against mallicious code (for the most part), but not
against badly designed code.  I can see where improperly tested and designed
code could cause problems on host machines.  I have not seen anything that
makes OLE code more secure (or more stable) in the real world environment.
(Just lots of paperwork being signed that says "We will not use these powers
for Evil".)
With Java, there has been alot of work to make the language less subject to
abuse.  I have not seen anything in that regards involving OLE.
This is a good thing.  And I hope that they release them to the rest of the
world before implementing them and releasing in a bunch of MS products.
(This is one of my big beefs with Microsoft.  I have seen a number of cases
where APIs are released to developers MONTHS after they appear in Microsoft
products.  Not cool.)
I am glad to hear it.  Before this thread i had not heard of a Mac version.
(Maybe it is becuase my friends who use the Mac have dropped using any
Microsoft products.  Come to think of it, it was because of how Word for the
Mac implemented OLE...  (Among other things.))
The part that interests me about the signing of executables is not for
distribution over the web.  (I beleive that OLE is not abuse proof enough
for that yet.)  What I would like to see is an API (or internal routines) to
allow the app to check the signature opon loading and perform checks to
detect tampering within the executable.  This I see as a very useful thing,
mpore so than the web applications.  Is such a thing planned?
Also, is there a web page that has additional information/plans about this API?

mention of it, but it barfs on the make if you do not have it.  (There are

I asked my wife about this (she is a midaeval history buff) and her response
was "depends on the time and king".
She proceeded to list off the long list of taxes that vassels could be
expected to pay.  The current taxes in California do not come close to the
arbitrary and intrusive taxes imposed in feudal times.  Taxes could be
levied at any time the lord demanded. (Check into the custom of "Tallage".)
Of course this did not include the tithes to the church (which were
manditory) or any of the special taxes for wars, ransoms, and the like... I suggest reading what life in that time was really like.  It makes
California seem like a Libretarians paradise in comparison.  (For example,
unmarried villein women were taxed due to the assumption that their being
unchaste lessened their value to the lord.  Sounds like something Pat
Buchannon would like to bring back...)

I suggest you take your beliefs to talk.origins.  I am sure that there are

creationism is no longer accepted as a rational belief.  The current line of thought in evolutionary science is not just a whim or
"pissing in the wind", it is based on WHAT WORKS.  Creationists have spent
alot of time making claims as to why the earth was created by God, but none
of them has come up with the slightest shread of EVIDENCE as to it actually
being done that way.  What passes for "Creation Science" is alot of
nitpicking about evolutionary theory.  (As if somehow "disproving"
evolution will somehow "prove" creationism.)  Most of the so-called
"proofs" for Creationism are based on ignorance of what evolutionary theory
actually consists of.
I suggest that you actually read the talk.origins FAQs.  They might teach
you something about real science instead of that pretend science you have
been getting at church.

Some are griping just to gripe.  Metcalfe may have a valid prediction here.
I have a machine that I use for work that is connected to the net via
ethernet.  No 28.8k bottlenecks involved.  Most of the time I am lucky if I
can exceed 14K bps to anything outside the local area.  When I run
traceroutes, the blockage is in MCI or Sprintnet land.  (Except for the one
to ftp.funet.fi early this week where where two of the machines somewhere
in California were caught in some sort of weird DNS loop.)
The bandwidth to the net has been oversold.  If the government were
*Really* concerned about "protecting the net", they would be on MCI and
Sprint's cases, not looking for virtual terrorists.  (Virtual Terrorists
are to Terrorists the same way that Virtual Reality is to actual reality.)
There have been days where you could not move anything at any reasonable
speed from certain areas of the country.
Yes, people have been predicting the end of the net (GIF/JPEG/WAV at 11!)
since it was founded.  In this case, I think that the person has enough
network experience to be right.  With the way things are now with oversold
bandwidth, the DNS numbers getting close to being used up, many of the
routers needing to be replaced and/or upgraded, and software that uses
bandwidth like candy (phone conversations, video conferencing, huge
interactive web page animations (like shockwave), real audio, and more as
the marketing droids can sell you on it.), the chances of a west coast
power-system style collapse does not seem that far from reality.  (There
are many who I know in the industry that are amazed that it has lasted this
On a smaller scale, those collapses happen in a small regional area, get
fixed and things go on.  But just like the earthquakes in California,
everyone is waiting for "the Big One".  (At least this one is preventable.

otherwise the net *IS* really doomed.)

It will also not catch on until there are better standards involving

there was a single interface (or "helper app") for whatever vendor you
decided to go with.
Currently every vendor of payment schemes has made it proprietary in some
way.  (At least the ones I have seen.)  This means that if the user visits
three different web pages, each using a payment scheme from a different
vendor, that user has to be signed up with all of those vendors.  (Or at
least have their helper apps.)
I will not even go into the hastles of trying to set it up from the server
side.  (The last payment scheme I installed (cybercash) was not very well
documented.  The documentation on the web site contradicted the software

Oregonian Friday July 11, 1997 Page B3
Man whose home was raided by IRS agents is charged
A man whose Vancouver home was raided by IRS agents in April has been
charged with two felonies in Tacoma.
James D. Bell was charged Wednesday with interfearing with a federal
officer and using false Social Security numbers.  He has been held without
bail in the Pierce County Jail since his May 18 arrest.
Bell, 38, is scheduled to be arrained July 18 before U.S. Magistrate J.
Kelly Arnold.
However, sources close to the case said Thursday that plea negotiations
are under way and are likely to be concluded before then.
Bell's home was raided and searched April 1 by an IRS task force of 20
In an affidavit for the search warrant, IRS Special Investigator Jeff
Gordon said that Bell was "directly soliciting others to set up a system
to murder government officials" and that he had devised a plan to
overthrow the government.
At a detention hearing in Tacoma, Arnold ordered Bell held without bail on
both allegations.

Lets try that again...
McCain Open to Key Recovery Alternative
by Rebecca Vesely 3:06pm  11.Jul.97.PDT Senator John McCain, sponsor of legislation that
would create a domestic key recovery system for all encrypted
commercial transactions and personal communications, said Friday that
he is open to hearing alternatives to such a plan. "We are not wedded entirely to key recovery," the Arizona Republican
said in an interview. McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation
Committee, and Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska) introduced the
Secure Public Networks Act last month. Privacy advocates and much of
the high-tech industry oppose domestic key recovery on grounds that it
would violate civil rights and be impractical and expensive to build and
manage. McCain said he met with Microsoft representatives recently to discuss
a new technology being developed by the software giant that could be
less intrusive and problematic than key recovery. The senator also said
he plans to meet with Netscape officials next week to discuss yet
another alternative. Officials from Netscape were not immediately available for comment. "I'm saying, OK, if you have another solution, I'd like to hear it,"
McCain said, though he stressed that protecting national security
remains his "first obligation." The McCain-Kerrey bill includes provisions for setting up a voluntary
domestic key recovery system, including incentives for those who
participate. Critics say participation in the key-management
infrastructure wouldn't really be voluntary - it would be a
prerequisite to conducting electronic commerce. Encryption, or
data-scrambling technology, is widely viewed as the cornerstone to
e-commerce because it conceals credit card numbers and other personal
information traveling over networks. Key recovery, as outlined in the
bill, would create a system of certificate authorities to whom users
would give a copy of their data keys. Law enforcement could then access
that copy of your key through a court order. McCain's flexibility on the issue could influence the debate over how
to protect national security while allowing a free market to flourish in
the digital age. Just two days ago, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the bill,
FBI director Louis Freeh testified on the need for mandatory domestic
key recovery, and some senators on the committee, notably the
chairman, Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), seemed to agree that some sort of
domestic key recovery is needed to allow law enforcement to wiretap
suspect digital communications and transactions.

I agree.  The article seemed to imply that both Microsoft and Netscape

Neither can I.  They seem to think they have the right and responsibility

Anything to make a buck.  Check out Microsoft's crypto API sometime.
There are all sorts of little hooks to enforce the export regs and make

as I am concerned.  Especially since they seem to change the API every

I don't think any of them believe in free speech for the masses.  (For

JAMES D. BELL PLEADS GUILTY TO OBSTRUCTING THE IRS AND USING FALSE SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBERS
United States Attorney Kate Pflaumer announced that JAMES DALTON BELL, 39,
pleaded guilty today in the federal court in Tacoma to two felony charges.
BELL, a resident of Vancouver, Washington, pleaded guilty to obstructing and
impeding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and to falsely using a social
security number with the intent to deceive.  United States District Court
Judge Franklin D. Burgess presided over today's proceedings.
The charges stem from an investigation initiated in October, 1996 by IRS
Internal Security Inspectors into reports that BELL was gathering the names
and home addresses of IRS employees. In previous court hearings, IRS
Inspectors testified that BELL had obtained the names and home addresses of
70 IRS employees as part of  "Operation LocatIRS." In the eight page plea
agreement signed by BELL, he acknowledged that he had gathered the names and
addresses of the IRS employees in order to intimidate them in the
performance of their official duties.
During the course of their investigation, IRS Inspectors discovered that
BELL was advocating a scheme called "Assassination Politics", whereby
persons would be rewarded with "digital cash" for killing certain
undesirable people.  BELL identified these undesirables as government
employees, such as IRS employees, who would be intimidated from enforcing
internal revenue laws for fear of being assassinated.  In the plea
agreement, BELL admitted that he suggested using "Assassination Politics" as
an enforcement mechanism for the "Multnomah County Common Law Court", and
that this was part of his effort to obstruct and impede the enforcement of
internal revenue laws.  In affidavits previously filed in this case, IRS
investigators identified BELL as a participant in the "Multnomah County
Common Law Court", which was described as a self-appointed anti-government
extremist group which purports to hold "trials" of IRS and other Government
employees for the performance of their official duties.  The affidavits
indicated that in January, 1997 the "Multnomah County Common Law Court" held
a "trial" of IRS and other Government officials.  In the plea agreement, BELL also admitted that on March 16, 1997, he
conducted a chemical "stink bomb" attack on the IRS office in Vancouver,
Washington, using the noxious chemical mercaptan.  In affidavits filed with
the Court, IRS Inspectors tied BELL to two previous mercaptan attacks
against non-government targets: one being a lawyer's office in 1984, and the
other a vehicle in 1989.  The IRS investigators also linked BELL to two
purchase orders for noxious chemicals, one in 1994 and one in 1996.
According to the plea agreement, the attack on the IRS office resulted in a
cost to the government of $1,359, and caused a number of IRS employees to
have to leave work.  In an affidavit previously filed in this case, IRS
Inspectors indicated that the mercaptan attack may have been linked to the
February 20, 1997 seizure of BELL's vehicle by the IRS for unpaid taxes.
As part of the plea agreement, BELL also admitted that he used several
different social security numbers in order to hide assets from the IRS and
thus to impede the IRS's ability to collect taxes he owed and to prevent the
IRS from levying his wages.
Federal agents had previously executed two search warrants on BELL's
residence.  On April 1, 1997, IRS agents seized computers, documents, and
firearms during a search.  In a follow-up search, the Environmental
Protection Agency seized a variety of dangerous chemicals which had been
discovered during the execution of the  IRS warrant.  BELL was arrested by
IRS Inspectors on May 16, 1997.  BELL continues to be held in custody based
on a May 23, 1997 ruling by Magistrate Judge J. Kelley Arnold that BELL
posed a danger to the community and was a flight risk.
BELL faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine
for the obstruction charge, and five years and a $250,000 fine for using a
phony social security number.
The IRS received assistance in the investigation of BELL from the Portland
Police Bureau, Oregon Department of Justice, Oregon State Police, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and the Vancouver, Washington Police Department.

Here is something to amuse, delight and horrify - the tail of:
       _One Man's Search for a Cryptographic Mythology_.
I recently wrote a VNODE (4.4bsd) based encrypted file-system. Now
the day dawned when I decided it was high time to discard my rather
egocentric working name _Proffs_ (i.e Proff File System) and cast
about for a decent, respectable name. My first thought on this
matter was:
CERBERUS, n. The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard
   the entrance -- against whom or what does not
   clearly appear; everybody, sooner or later, had to go there,
   and nobody wanted to carry off the entrance. Cerberus is known
   to have had three heads, and some of the poets have credited
   him with as many as a hundred.
Only, what was the relation between KERBEROS and CERBERUS? Pups
from the same litter, or was the relationship a little more
incestuous? I had to find out. There was no way - n o  w a y - I'd be
having my encrypted file system playing second fiddle to that evil
authentication beast.
KERBEROS; also spelled Cerberus.  n.  The watch dog of
   Hades, whose duty it was to guard the entrance--against
   whom or what does not clearly appear; . . . it is known
   to have had three heads. . .
Mythology couldn't get any more incestuous than that.
450,000 bytes of Greek polytheism later, and I'm wondering if the
Gods of Olympus really had any high-paid guards to speak of except
the multi-headed mongrel from Hades. I'm feeling down. I'm cursing
the Ancients. I'm disrespectfully humming tunes `All and All it's
Just Another Greek in the Wall', and `Athena be my Lover' when I
JANUS: in Roman mythology, custodian of the universe, god of
   beginnings. The guardian of gates and doors, he held
   sacred the first hour of the day, first day of the month, and
   first month of the year (which bears his name). He is represented
   with two bearded faces set back to back.
Custodian of the universe. Guardian of gates and doors. Cooool.
Janus.  January. I like it.  Only while I'm liking it, I'm thinking
that I've heard the word Janus a lot before. I'm thinking it isn't
just me who has looked up from the middle of a Greek mythology
text, whilst in the throes of a name hunt with the words "Cooool"
on their tongue.  No: the Gods just don't smile on me that way.
AltaVista confirms the truth of Heaven's bad attitude towards me.
17,423 references.  _The Janus Mutual Trade Fund_, _The Janus
Project_, _Janus ADA95_, a dozen ISPs from Canada (what is it WITH
these Canadians?), _Janus' cool word list_ (turns out to be not so
cool), _The Janus Ensemble_, _Hotel Janus_, _Janus Theatre_,
_janus.com_, _janusfunds.com_, _Janus_ an Australian Police drama
series and of course, the sixth moon of Saturn - _Janus_. Janus is
out-of-the-picture. I'm not sure whether to feel smug or grim about
the rest of the world's lack of originality.
Guards. Guardians. The Greeks didn't have many with bite and I'm
loosing patience with the whole culture. Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and
Thalia do not grace me.  What I need is something that evokes
passion within my cryptographic domain. And when you come down to
it, that means something which produces copious amounts of gore
and blood, at will, from those who would dare to pass its demesne
of protection.
     The Erinyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished by
     their secret stings the crimes of those who escaped or defied
     public justice. The heads of the Furies were wreathed with
     serpents, and their whole appearance was terrific and appalling.
     Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.  They were
     also called Eumenides.
Aye. Plenty of gore there. But somewhat lacking in cryptographic
analogy.  Fantastic material for the group that doesn't meet at
number 41 every Saturday night though. They will appreciate what
the Erinyes were trying to achieve.
Somewhat heartened, my mind turns to the Erinyes' dress sense. "..heads
of the Furies were wreathed with serpents, and their whole appearance
was terrific and appalling". Terrific. Serpents.
Terrific \Ter*rif"ic\, a. [L. terrificus; fr. terrere: to frighten
   + facere: to make. See Terror, and Fact.] Causing
   terror; adapted to excite great fear or dread; terrible; as, a
   terrific form; a terrific sight.
Is it a symptom of society in decay that this word has come to mean:
Excellent \Ex"cel*lent\, a. [F. excellent, L. excellens, -entis,
   p. pr. of excellere. See Excel.] 1. Excelling;
   surpassing others in some good quality or the sum of qualities;
   of great worth; eminent, in a good sense; superior, as an
   excellent man, artist, citizen, husband, discourse, book, song,
   etc.; excellent breeding, principles, aims, action.
Or as Milton would say:
   To love . . . What I see excellent in good or fair.
On the other hand, David Hume (1711-1776):
   The more exquisite any good is, of which a small specimen is
   afforded us, the sharper is the evil, allied to it; and few
   exceptions are found to this uniform law of nature. The most
   sprightly wit borders on madness; the highest effusions of joy
   produce the deepest melancholy; the most ravishing pleasures
   are attended with the most cruel lassitude and disgust; the most
   flattering hopes make way for the severest disappointments. And,
   in general, no course of life has such safety (for happiness is
   not to be dreamed of) as the temperate and moderate, which
   maintains, as far as possible, a mediocrity, and a kind of
   insensibility, in every thing.
Perhaps it is the sign of a brain in decay, rather than a society
that I dwell on it so, because Terrific hair serpents of course
lead unfailing into the arms of the Medusa. A guardian of fearsome
looks, but dubious motivations according to authorities like Clash
of the Titans (1981). A moot point, perhaps as Princeton's
history department no longer wants to talk to me. I'm cast adrift,
to rely on my Plasticine childhood memories and the mythological
swamp of the web.

Jesus. I've been sucked into comic book hell. Princeton, take me
back.  I won't curse at the ancient Greek's sexual proclivities
anymore. I'm sure chaste marriages were very daunting to those yet
to have them. I was only joking. Lighten up will you?
But, alas, the history faculty however was still nursing its
wounds, and was not ready to forgive me. I'd have to find an
authoritative source somewhere else. Perhaps I could filter out the
comic book hell contaminants and come up with respected history Ivy,
even if it wasn't Princeton Ivy.
   To decapitate - to castrate. The terror of the Medusa is thus
   a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something.
   The hair upon the Medusa's head is frequently represented in
   works of art in the form of snakes, and these once again are
   derived from the castration complex. It is a remarkable fact
   that however frightening they may be in themselves, they
   nevertheless serve as a mitigation of the horror, for they
   replace the penis, the absence of which is the cause of the
   horror. This is a confirmation of the technical rule according
   to which a multiplication of penis symbols signifies castration.
   Sigmund Freud
   The Medusa's Head
You had to hand it to Sigmund. He was nothing if not authoritative,
and after reading his inspiring words on the terrific serpent haired
woman, it became clear to me that _Proffs_ and the Gorgon had somewhat
unresolved metaphorical incompatibilities. I didn't want my software
giving anyone a castration complex.
I decided to put aside the denizens of Olympus from contest verbatim.
I'd read Fraud on Perversions a few years before and knew Medusa
was just a portent of what was to come.  What I needed was another
polytheist culture entirely.  Latin didn't help me. Nearly all the
Roman Gods had been vilely plagiarised from the Greeks, Latin names
or not.  Freud knew this as well as I did.  The Norse gods were of
little assistance to me.  The only one worth paying school to was
Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Loki was a very cool fellow, which
was why his name has been appropriated as a moniker by virtually
every Bjorn, Sven, and Bob hacker to come out of Scandinavia in
the last 10 years. No, Loki was not for me.
The problem craved for a polytheist mythology outside the realm of
my, and more importantly Sigmund Freud's, Western European upbringing.
The answer to my question was by definition locked within a body of
history I didn't know an onion skin about. In order for the pilgrim
to reach the master he must first place his foot on the path, no
matter how gradual the slope up the mountain of enlightenment. Zen
Buddhism is good like that. Fabricating parables up as you go along
that is.
   Zen master Gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a
   question about Zen. A young novice began to imitate
   him in this way. When Gutei was told about the novice's imitation,
   he sent for him and asked him if it were true. The novice admitted
   it was so. Gutei asked him if he understood. In reply the novice
   held up his index finger. Gutei promptly cut it off.  The novice
   ran from the room, howling in pain. As he reached the threshold,
   Gutei called, "Boy!". When the novice returned, Gutei raised
   his index finger. At that instant the novice was enlightened.
But wait. This Koan isn't fabricated. At least, not by me. And
unlike most Zen Koan's I think you will agree that it pleasantly
satisfies Schopenhauer's "life, without pain, has no meaning".
However, semantically I'm seeing a very unhealthy correlation to
forgetting one's encryption key and losing one's finger.
My mind is drawn to the memory of the real-life nightmare of laying
in the easy-chair of a Swanston St. hypnotherapist suite, gazing
intently into a bright, but distant red light, while chanting the
mantra "I am not cynical about hypnotherapy. I am not cynical about
hypnotherapy.  I am not cynical about an Indian doctor with a 5th
floor office decorated coup'd'Edelstien. I'm not cynical about a
man who claims that his foremost clientele are rich middle aged women

can claim 2/3rds of the cost of these jewellery retrieval sessions

infact suffering from some form of Mesmer complex.  And by all the
powers in Heaven, I have no pessimism about recalling my god-damned
I never did remember the pass-phrase and you will notice Gutei
keeps very quiet about what he does with the novice's finger. In
this particular case, given the value of the data, I would have
traded placed with Gutei's novice, before you can say "Boy! Was I
I put my chin on my knee, and stare at the grain of my beige
plastic monitor case. Unless I could jump into another reality
it was the end of the line for _Proffs_ and _One Man's Search
for a Cryptographic Mythology_. Boy! Was I bummed. One of the great sins of us programmers is procedural thinking.
And it was exactly this sort of folly I was engaging in. There were
around 6 billion other realities going about their business. I
grant you that 2 billion of these were no doubt indulging in the
confusion and diffusion of an avalanche of pseudo-random mental
images and sequences we associate with dreams, and probably another
2 billion busy expanding their minds with the powerful products of
hash or decaying into a compressive state of increasing entropy
and beer rounds. This still left a select 2 billion souls with
which to weave my work.  If I approached them directly rather than
by analysing the information trails they left behind, I'd stand a
good chance of getting my feet onto the path of cryptographic
mythological enlightenment.
I have a Swedish friend who calls himself Elk on odd days and
Godflesh on even days. Don't ask why. As far as I know he's not
bisexual. Elk listened to my quest for cryptographic myth. He
had pondered, and uncovered a diamond in the rough. MARUTUKKU.
  The third name is MARUTUKKU, Master of the arts of protection,
  chained the Mad God at the Battle. Sealed the Ancient Ones in
  their Caves, behind the Gates.
F a r  o u t. Master of the arts of protection. Chained the Mad
God.  Sealed the Ancient Ones in their Caves, behind the Gates.
Even the very word MARUTUKKU looks like it has been run through a
product cipher.
But I wasn't about to trust the work of a self-admitted Swedish
Sumeria freak who was obviously suffering from a bi-polar moniker
disorder. Was it mere coincidence that MARUTUKKU was an anagram
for KUKU MART and KUKU TRAM? I didn't want MARUTUKKU to end up as
another cog in the annals of Freudian analogy. What I
needed was the sort of Authoritative History that only Princeton's
history faculty could provide. The tablets of the Enuma Elish:
  The Akkadian Creation Epic
   Based on the translation of E. A. Speiser, with the additions
   by A. K. Grayson, Ancient Near-Eastern Texts Relating to the
   Old Testament, third edition, edited by James Pritchard (Princeton,
   1969), pp. 60-72; 501-503, with minor modifications.
   This work, the ancient Mesopotamian creation epic consisting of
   seven tablets, tells of the struggle between cosmic order and
   chaos. It is named after its opening words. It was recited on
   the fourth day of the ancient Babylonian New Year's festival.
   The text probably dates from the Old Babylonian period, i.e.,
   the early part of the second millennium B.C.E.
   The third name is MARUTUKKU  Master of the arts of protection,
   chained the Mad God at the Battle. Sealed the Ancient Ones in
   their Caves, behind the Gates.
   MARUTUKKU truly is the refuge of his land, city, and people.
   Unto him shall the people give praise forever.
All praise the MARUTUKKU! My search had born a ripe and tasty
fruit indeed. The quest for a cryptographic mythology was
complete. Or was it? The words of Hume kept coming back to me
and I had a nagging feeling that there was some substance in
If MARUTUKKU was my exquisite cryptographic good, of wit, effusive
joy, ravishing pleasure and flattering hope; then where was the
counter point? The figure to its ground - the sharper evil, the
madness, the melancholy, the most cruel lassitudes and disgusts
and the severest disappointments. Was Hume right? Because if he
was, there was only one organisation this string of hellish adjectives
could represent. The cryptographic devil with its 500,000 sq feet
of office space in Maryland. But surely there could be no reference
to such an organisation in the 4,000 year old Babylonian tablets.
The idea was preposterous. Wasn't it?
TABLET VII OF THE ENUMA ELISH:

   May the gods bring their presents before him, that from
   him they may receive their assignments; none can without
   him create artful works.  Four black-headed ones are
   among his creatures; aside from him no god knows the
   answer as to their days.
It's a cold and wintry night, here in Melbourne. Despite this, the
gusts of wind and rain seem to be unusually chilling. What had I,
in my search for a cryptographic mythology, stumbled onto?
I look hard at the seven letters E-S-I-Z-K-U-R. A frown turns to
a smile and then a dead pan stare. I write down:

@_subject: Who "invented" remailers? 
Arguable point.  Depends on if you fear getting busted because of which
causes you support.  For many that is a serious issue.
And your point being...?  The consititution is a document that is followed
only when it suits the purposes of those in power.  If it was not for the
factional infighting of the various branches of power, we would have no
rights left at all.
That is for three reasons:
1) Many in the FBI get off on that kind of power and see nothing wrong
with it.  (As long as they are the ones doing the survelence.  Try doing
it to them and see what happens...)
2) It is on all their stationary.
3) It is carved in stone on the building. Unfortunatly for mixmaster to work effectivly, you need a threshold of
usage.  That threshold has not been reached yet.  With the successful
campaign against remailers by those who oppose them, the problem is made
worse.  (As well as supporting a form of encryption not commonly available
to "Joe Sixpack".)  Currently, use of the Mixmaster remailer system is out
of reach of most of the average users out there.  The only serious project
to address that need has been Private Idaho and development has stopped on
that project.
Julf's remailer was more of a nym server than a remailer.  A remailer
gives a one way path, a nymserver gives a path back for replies.
Currently the nymserver network is in pretty bad shape as well.  They are
difficult to use and are dependant on the whims of the remailer network.
(If one element in the chain of remailers goes down, you are screwed until
you can reset things.)  They also have people who would like to see them
shut down because they do not like the uses to which they are put.
(Spreading ideas that are illegal, immoral, and/or fattening.)
An easy to use nymserver would be a "Good Thing(tm)".  I believe it to be
possible, it just needs better ways of surviving the rubber hose attacks
such things come under from time to time.
Do you have a design that needs implementing?

This reminded me of a thought I had this morning...
If the Unibomber had actually wanted to improve his reputation capitol, he
should have gane about things differently.
Instead of going after college professors and the like (which only appeals
to MUDers and other people failing thair classes) he should have taken on
a different group.
If he had issued out a Make Money Fast pyramid scheme with his PO box as
one of the addresses and then sent bombs to those who responded, he would
have been the hero to millions.  By eliminating would-be spammers from the
downline of life, he would have been the savior to millions.  he would
have web pages in his honor.  He would have bumper stickers with such
slogans as "SPAM = DEATH" made in his honor.
But he blew it...

Quoting Ray Everett-Church:
I can think of a number of reasons why a business would want to remain
"hidden".  Fear of retribution is the biggest.  This could be "valid"
retribution (such as for selling shoddy products or annoying sales
practices) or "invalid" retribution (such as selling a product that
offends the local moral or legal establishment), but is a product that
people desire and are willing to pay money for.
But such markets are "illegal" and thus not to be thought about by good

This is the best description of AP so far.  Jim had about as much chance
of implementing it as most adolescent fantasies.  (At least he was not
posting about porn fantasies involving the Brady Bunch meets Gilligan's
Island or somesuch...)
The general consensus of those who met him at the first Portland physical
meeting was that he was pretty far into fantasy.  (There is a certain
childish glee that tends to accompany such thoughts.  He had that glee
when talking about AP and the carbon fiber threat. (Although he did not
give actual methods on the carbon thread one.  Just vague comments about
"something wonderful".))
You were not the only one to point that out to him.  He was so attached to
his little plan that he was totally unwilling to see any flaw in it.  I
pointed out that people with the amount of cash and scruples of Bill
Gatesw would use it to wipe out compeating companies staff and/or
management.  (Though, if they were smart, they would just take out the
lead engineer on the most threatening projects.)
The big problem I had with AP, other than implementation and concept, was
that he was unwilling to do his own dirty work.  He reminded me of people
who eat meat, but could not concieve of killing Bambi.  You don't go into
a scheme like that and still think that you won't get blood on your

No you don't.  You believe in free speach for the things that do not tweak
your worldview.  I am certainly willing to bet that if you had the chance
to remove the rights of the "bent" people from expressing their views, you
would not hesitate in the slightest.
"Whatever that may be" is a very telling statement.  How can you tell what
is "appropreate" or "not".  What the media tells you?  What your religious
leaders tell you?  What the voices in your head tell you?  What the
government tells you?  All of those values are subjective.  They depend on
what you may or may not believe is "harmful".  Most of that is based on
cultural conditioning.
Kill them now.  Stick them in a box and feed them through a slot in the
door. Gouge out their eyes. Cut off their hands.
You view the constitution as a problem?  Free speach as a problem?
Or maybe you have a problem that your children might learn about things
that you disapprove of?  Maybe they might read something that shows them
that sex is a part of life, not just something that is a side benefit of
marriage.  Maybe they might learn that sex is fun!  Maybe they will find
out that the religion their parents saddled them with is based on lies and
urban legend.  maybe they will find that their government is not so kind
and benevolent after all.  Maybe they will find out that their parents are
human and make mistakes.  Or maybe they will even figure out that the
material the parents are so afraid of are only harmful to the parents...
It is also an impossibility.  People have tried to control the natural
interest in sex since the dawn of time.  Has not worked yet.  Porn has
existed since man discovered woman.  Some of the earliest existing films
are porno movies.  What has changed is access and awareness.  Until
reletive reciently porn has been more underground.  But with the spread of
technology, it has become easier and easier to supply the demand for such
Or as a certain math professor once said... "Dirty books are fun!"
Your kid is already at a disadvantage.  His parents have lost perspective.
You assume that it actually is a problem.  Your moral qualms over pictures
of sexual activity does not a problem make.
it is people like yourself who are activly destroying what little remains
of the constitution.  You want an exception for this and a rationalization
for that until thre is nothing left but the blandest and most tasteless
thoughts and speach.
Like actually follow it?  Wow!  That would be a first.
You are talking to the wrong group of people.  What you are asking for is
a way to censor the masses.
Anything an adult can get, a child can get.
Attempts to censor children and control what they hear, see and feel are
vague attempts to do the same to adults.  You cannot control the
information feed to children without controling the information feed for
adults. (But deep down in your heart you would like to see that as well.)
You think this information will harm them?  Actually the control freak
mentality you want to impose is far far worse.  In actuality, much of the
problems you would like to blame on porn are, in actuality, borne out of
this country's hypocracy and neurosis about sex and sexuality.  the reason
people are so fucked up about fucking is because they have been taught
that sex is somehow wrong and shameful and dirty.  That appreciating the
beauty of the sexual act is somehow more vile and disgusting than showing
someone shot full of holes.
I think you need to examine WHY this information makes you uncomfortable.
You might learn something about yourself.  But don't expect us to help
inflict your sickness on the minds of your children.

A team of federal agents, led by IRS internal security personnel, raided a
home at 711 W. 20th St. Thursday morning.
The raid apperently is a continuation of an investigation into the
activities of James D. Bell, whose McLaughlin Heights home at 7214
Corregidor Road was raided April 1st.
The 20th Street home is occupied by Robert W. West, who was not home when
the raid occured.
A federal agent who answered his phone during the search refused to say
what the agents were seeking.
The search warrent application and affidavit is under seal by a federal
court in Tacoma.
In the affidavit for the search warrent for Bell's home, IRS Special
Investigator Jeff Gordon alledged that Bell was "directly solicting others
to set up a system to murder government officials."
Bell is the author of a 10-part essay called "Assassination Politics,"
which has been widely circulated on the Internet, particularly in
anti-government forums.
After the raid, agents made no other public statements.

                     by Wired News Staff                      12:03pm  4.Sep.97.PDT In a major advance for
                     hard-line proponents of giving the government wide
                     access to electronic data, several influential
                     senators have declared their support of mandatory
                     key recovery features for all encryption-enabled
                     software sold in the United States.                      At a Judiciary subcommittee meeting Wednesday,
                     Senator Dianne Feinstein was among those who
                     came out strongly in support of the position taken
                     by FBI Director Louis Freeh that mandatory key
                     recovery is essential to deterring crime.                      "Nothing other than some kind of mandatory key
                     recovery really does the job," the California
                     Democrat said at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
                     Committee's technology, terrorism, and
                     government information subcommittee. "The

                     spy agencies, been strong supporters of such
                     measures. But in Congress, sweeping measures
                     to give government agents an easy-open back
                     door to scrambled data have been met with strong
                     opposition and legislation that cuts in the
                     direction.                      Bills in both the House and Senate have sought to
                     exclude mandatory key recovery systems as a
                     requirement not only for US software-makers and
                     users but also for export products. The Senate
                     version of this liberalized policy is, practically
                     speaking, dead, supplanted by the Secure Public
                     Networks Act by Senators Bob Kerrey
                     (D-Nebraska) and John McCain (R-Arizona). The
                     bill offers incentives to software manufacturers
                     building key recovery features into their products.
                     In the House, a liberalization bill by
                     Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia) is not only alive but
                     gained a majority of members as cosponsors.                      The software industry, civil liberties advocates,
                     privacy groups on both the right and the left have
                     opposed mandatory key recovery. Some
                     opponents were stunned by Wednesday's hearing.
                     "It was really shocking to hear how casually
                     senators and the FBI director talked about
                     imposing domestic controls," said Alan Davidson,
                     staff counsel at the Center for Democracy and
                     Technology. "They've crossed a new line in this
                     debate."                      "It appears that Senator Feinstein wants a
                     Constitution- free zone for the Internet," said
                     Banisar, staff counsel at the Electronic Privacy
                     Information Center.                      Reuters contributed to this report.

@_subject: A maybe workable idea 
I am not certain about how well this would work.  I am certain that the LEA
community would try and compromise or stop it at some point.
The idea is to get the ACLU or some other group with some name recognition
in the software/privacy/free-speech realm to sponsor a program to certify
programs with crypto as GAK-free.  I think that having software with a big
yellow sticker stating "certified not to contain Government backdoors or
other peepholes into your data" would have a useful effect on the buying
I wonder if a "truth in labeling" law could be pushed through...  Imagine a
big sticker on products that say "Government agencies can read files
created by this product without your knowledge".
Probably a pipe dream.  I can see a number of problems with it.  Microsoft
would bully their way into getting the cert GAKed or not.  The FBI would
probably put pressure on the retail chains to avoid products pushing
political messages such as freedom from Government intrusion from being sold.
It would be worth a try at least...
