and Bob Franksten comments:

Note that an ISP can easily log email even when a user runs his own
SMTP server and/or delivers his own outbound mail. You just record
all the raw packets to port 25.
On the other hand, the SMTP STARTTLS (start transport layer security)
command is getting pretty common these days, as most MTA senders will
now use it automatically whenever the receiving MTA advertises
support for it. Receiver support is not the default because it
requires a X.509 certificate, but some installation scripts (e.g.,
Debian Linux) automatically generate and install a self-signed
certificate if required.
Even much of my incoming spam comes in with STARTTLS these days. I
figure that should make traffic analysis just a little more difficult.
When a SMTP session uses STARTTLS, only the IP addresses of the MTAs
are visible to a passive wiretap at the ISP. Because self-signed
certificates are so common, however, an active man-in-the-middle
attack would probably work in most cases. Clearly we need certificate
caching like that implemented in SSH.
That implies that only headers need be logged, so PGP or S/MIME by
itself (without STARTTLS) provide no protection at all as they both
leave all email headers in the clear.

@_subject: [IP] I strongly afree with this djf Google search and 
Instead of getting mad at Google, why don't we get even?
Here are two simple ideas that any good coder could turn out in an
1. Write and disseminate a little daemon that makes randomize queries
to Google from your computer. Every few minutes to an hour (i.e., at
random times) it would send a Google query with search terms randomly
chosen from a large dictionary. This would pollute Google's logs and
create reasonable doubt if you are later accused of entering queries
for, say, the words "neck" and "snap".
2. Write and disseminate a web proxy filter that would route all
Google queries through the TOR (The Onion Router) network and strip
off all tracking mechanisms from the results. This may be a more
palatable alternative to routing all your web surfing through TOR,
which can be quite slow.
I consider it unproductive to scream at Google, as has become so
popular of late. It is also misguided to call for laws to limit what
they can do with our search queries. Even if Google were to say that
they no longer keep personally-identifiable search queries, there
would be no way to verify it. And any new privacy law for search
engines would surely be riddled with enormous loopholes for
government abuse.
As with confidentiality, the *only* solution here is technological.
So let's get coding.

This is of course possible, and it's a bit surprising that this other
shoe has not yet fallen so long after 9/11.
But consider that any push to regulate or restrict strong crypto would:
1. Draw widespread public attention to the fact that the government
cannot break it;
2. Be totally ineffectual since crypto is so widely available from so
many places in the world;
3. Go against the strongly stated public positions of many
conservative Republicans during the "crypto wars" of the mid 1990s,
when, coincidentally, Clinton was in office and pushing the Clipper
4. Be totally ignored by precisely those people whom the government
is supposedly most interested in targeting; and
5. Be mostly irrelevant to what the spooks actually do when they
vacuum up electronic communications, namely traffic analysis (who
talks to who, when, where and how much) rather than acquiring actual
content. Content takes too much effort to analyze (and possibly
translate), even when it's in the clear. Traffic analysis can be done
automatically on a huge scale, and it can be frighteningly effective.
As an aside, I note that not much attention has been paid to the
"where"  part of communications. Cell phones -- even when they're not
in calls -- make excellent physical tracking devices. Not even secure
end-to-end encryption can change that. It's inherent in how they work.
I have no actual information on this, but based on my knowledge of
the technology and ongoing revelations of the government's insatiable
appetite for data on non-citizens and citizens alike, I confidently
predict that the next big revelation in the ongoing saga of massive
government data-mining will involve mobile phone registrations. These
are the short "I'm here and ready for a call" data messages that all
mobile phones transmit every few minutes whenever they're on and
idle. Even without GPS for augmented E911 positioning, registrations
tell what cell sector you're in. These sectors can be quite small (a
few blocks) in densely populated areas. At the very least, they're
certainly sufficient to tell what country and city you're in.
