French Constitution censors Internet control
As we speculated in our last bulletin (2.09), the French Conseil
Constitutionnel, watchdog of the 1958 Constitution, censored 2 articles in
a new telecom act which were intended to establish a kind of administrative
control over Internet speech and online services.
The nine "Sages" said that the creation of the Conseil Superieur de la
Telematique, which would have make guidelines on Internet content, breaches
article 34 of the Constitution which states that the Parliament can act
alone to dictate rules concerning "civic rights and fundamentals garanties
given to citizens for a fair exercice of public liberties". The CST could
have undermine these principles, because the law didn't specify clearly how
it would have taken its decisions. So the Conseil recognized the particular
state of the Internet, which is not a basic medium.
Only one section remains in the censored law : it obliges ISPs to give
their clients "technical means" to forbid or select access to online
services, software that allows a so-called "parental control".

Singapore and the Censorship Proxy Server
A communique from SingNet, Singapore's main Internet Service Provider,
states that "ALL SingNet customers will be required to connect to SingNet's
proxy server by the deadline September 14th 1996, failing which you would
not be able to access the web without the proxy. This applies to all
dial-up, ISDN, and leased line customers (STIX customers are exempted). "
The proxy server will ease the ISP to "Deny access to blacklisted sites
supplied by SBA". SingNet said that "Access to sites banned by the SBA will
prompt the message :
The site you requested is not accessible
For more information on Singapore's Internet regulation, please check
On July 11 the Singapore government passed the Singapore Broadcasting
Authority Act (Chapter 297) in which it announced a "Class Licence Scheme"
aimed "to encourage responsible use of the Internet while facilitating its
healthy development in Singapore. It encourages minimum standards in
cyberspace and seeks to protect Net users, particularly the young, against
the broadcast of unlawful or objectionable materials. ... SBA will focus on
content which may undermine public morals, political stability and
religious harmony of Singapore. However, SBA recognises that it is
impossible to regulate the Internet fully. ... Singaporeans can help SBA in
the identification of objectionable sites in order to keep cyberspace
clean. SBA welcomes public feedback on objectionable content found on the
Internet. Members of the public can write to SBA, call its toll-free
hotline ... or post their views on the SBA homepage at
 "
China, which has created its own Internet regulations aimed at controlic
data traffic and urged netizens to declare themselves to the authorities,
approved the Singapore Act and an official was quoted as saying, "China has
a lot to learn from Singapore's experience" (source : Fight-censorship
mailing list).

G7 and the EC take strong steps for Key Escrow Encryption
The European Commission's DG-13 division on information security (Infosec)
opened on July 30th a "call for tenders" for "preparatory works" towards
regulating encryption procedures. The plan is aimed to test the
introduction of the Europe-wide network of Trusted Third Party Services
Observers saw in this move the so-called "guidelines" the EC was to propose
last year, when press reports (Nature, Sept. 28, 1995) argued the
Commission and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg were willing to regulate
encryption use through the creation of TTPs.
The Infosec call for tenders, which will end by September 30, is to
"identify, define and verify ... operationnal, technical, regulatory and
legal aspects ... to assess the effectiveness, economics and acceptability
of Trusted Third Party Services."
Other voices in European talks, however, said these "preparatory works" are
to push for EU countries to adopt TTPs and the principles of key-escrow
encryption. Nordic countries such as Finland, Denmark and Sweden, are said
to be opposed to change encryption legislation, as France and Britain took
steps in June and July to enforce the creation of TTPs in their own
On July 30 G7 countries agreed policies that would "accelerate
consultations on encryption that allows, when necessary, lawful government
access to data and communications in order to prevent or investigate acts
of terrorism, while protecting the privacy of legitimate communications".
The EPIC, in Washington, DC, said "stronger measures sought by the US to
restrict information on the Internet and limit the availabilioty of
encryption were apparently not adopted by the G7 countries". Among other
industrialised nations, Japan and Australia are said, like Nordic countries
in Europe, to oppose key escrow as a mean to regulate the free flow of
information. Remember the OECD talks in June, were the US tried to impose
key-escrow legislation to the 27-countries' club of the industrial world

lambda 2.12
* * * * *
For several months French authorities have quietly begun to build the
world's first "key recovery" encryption scheme, scheduled to take effect
early in 1997. But a leaked letter sent to the official security agency,
the SCSSI, reveals that the so-called "trust" has some limitation in the
draft project.
The proposal, called a "decret d'application," is a prime ministerial
decree scheduled to be issued after the Telecommunications Reform Act of
July 27, 1996
( In France, a
law only takes effect after the government signs it as a decree.
The decree will define the business conditions of future "trusted third
party" (TTP) systems -- in French referred to as "tiers de
confidentialite," or a "privacy third party" -- and stresses the difference
between the two basic encryption applications: digital signature and
privacy. These agents will have the role of
electronic notaries, keeping crypto keys in custody for law enforcement or
national intelligence purposes.
Lambda Bulletin has also learned that French authorities won't impose the
"key recovery" scheme as a "mandatory" one. Yet it seems clear that a
company will not be able to do business-as-usual if its encryption systems
aren't certified by TTPs.
Is this good news for individual users? It's not certain: The law says that
crypto is legal *only* if keys are kept in custody. It won't be mandatory

Peacefire vs Cybersitter
Parental control abuses
*       *       *       *       *
An insider quarrel between blocking-software CyberSitter and one of the Web
site blocked has emerged recently. A US youth association against Net
censorship, Peacefire (w claimed on December 7 :
"Sometime today or yesterday, CYBERsitter put  on its list
of blocked sites. Next time users of the program update their "filter
file", they will see our web page blocked along with Playboy.com,
Penthouse.com etc. (not to mention NOW.org, Members.GNN.com, and C2.org).
Apparently, the company president read our page about CYBERsitter at:
 and didn't like it."
Solid Oak Software ( owner of the blocking program,
claims Peacefire put online some advices or tips to abort CyberSitter
efficiency for teenagers; claimed one time of "copyright infringements";
and decided to urge Peacefire's IAP to block its account.
Remember that these softwares were designed to allow parents to control
their child's access to the Internet. "Parental control", as it is called,
was suppose to give ways for parents to self-censor Internet content. But
when people trust the technology and give too much faith to black-listed
sites maintained by other individuals' moral standards, parents don't
really keep on their "parental control" anymore. They even fail to tackle
their own responsability towards their childs.
On December 27 the CPSR ( wrote a protest letter to Solid Oak.
Abstracts: "Your own description of your product provides a fairly concise
description of CYBERSitter's restrictions: "any site that focuses on topics
such as adult or issues, illegal activities, bigotry, racism, drugs or
pornography". Using this list", the CPSR went on, "any determined
individuals with web browsers might easily build a profile of sites that
are blocked by CYBERSitter. Several members of our group dowloaded your
demo, and quickly verified that your software completely or partially
blocks access to sites such as the National Organization of Women
( and the Yahoo search engine (
Since CYBERSitter's behavior can be easily categorized, Peacefire's
publishing of a list of blocked sites does not justify blocking Peacefire's
site, or any similar unsavory activities. ... By blocking sites that focus
on topics such as [sex] and drug use, SolidOak may filter potentially
educational materials regarding AIDS and drug abuse prevention."
As Haselton wrote later, "Most letters to the president, Brian Milburn, at
bmilburn at solidoak.com, or to their support staff at support at solidoak.com,
are now being bounced with the message, "this account has been configured
to reject all messages on this topic..." i would guess that their mail
software at those accounts is rejecting all messages with the word
"Peacefire" in the subject line, so remember to leave it out if you decide
to write to them about this. (And thanks for your support if you do!)"
P.S.- The European Commission has submitted draft guidelines to member
States concerning the Internet's content regulations. They were quite

It is a draft decree prepared by the SCSSI, the security agency, which

A brief summary of what the French electronic notary will look like:
The government - The SCSSI
* Will say which encryption product will be concerned; all crypto systems
will be OK if a key recovery scheme is scheduled; (PGP and the like are not
on the list of "approved" products);
* Will decide which firm is OK to become a TTP; but no justification will
be needed for negative requests;
The TTP, "le notaire"
* All commercial firms or entities (SA, SARL, consortiums...) will be concerned;
* But all its members, CEOs or associates must be "French": like the
majority of its finantial assets;
* Will be submitted to "professionnal secret" and obliged to keep third
party encryption keys away from illegal wiretapping activities;
The (commercial) user
* Will be obliged to use authorised encryption products;
* Will engage itself to fully cooperate with the TTP;
The (basic) user
* Even if the sheme will not be mandatory, using encryption without the
backing of a TTP will be considered illegal;
* Huge finantial and logistical procedures will discourage NGO's, small
companies and the citizen to protect legally its electronic communications.

CENSORING CENSORSHIP ATTEMPTS -- A LA FRANCAISE
The French Telco Act, which was voted by the Parliament on June 7, may
follow the same path than the US Communications Decency Act. A group of
Socialists Senators has sent a request to examine eventual
unconstitutionality of the law.
The new Act, due to meet new criteria for telecoms competition in France,
has also taken some steps to create an administrative control of speech and
services via online services and the Internet. The new council, le Conseil
Sup�rieur de la T�l�matique, "could block the free communication of
thoughts and opinions, and may eventually establish a principle of
preliminary declaration" for online speech, reads the document given to the
Conseil Constitutionnel, the supreme watchdog of the French 1958
Constitution (and the principles of the 1789 Declaration des Droits de
l'Homme et du Citoyen).
Indeed, the law may breach article 34 of the Constitution which says that
the Parliament alone could indict rules concerning "the basic garanties
given to citizens for the exercice of their civil liberties". But the newly
created CST may appreciate if a Web site or a newgroup could be illicite
according to the French Penal Code. This "appreciation" is not sufficiently
well defined in the Telco Act, constitutionnal jurists said.
Article 66 of the Constitution also states that the appreciation of the
Penal Code should be the role of the penal judiciary (le Juge Penal), but
shouldn't depend on any administrative body or any administrative judge
(Juge Administratif).
But other voices said that the existing Conseil Sup�rieur de l'Audiovisuel
(which regulates broadcasting content) is based on the same principles.
Then, the Conseil Constitutionnel will have to make a difference between a
TV program and a Usenet feed. That's what the Philadelphia Court acted when
they censored the CDA.
Final decision awaited in Paris before the end of July (July 26th in theory).

OECD FAILS TO ACT ON KEY-ESCROW ENCRYPTION; THE US ACCUSED OF "POLICY
The Paris-based OECD, the 24-members club of industrialised nations, has
failed to take a step towards international recongnition of key-escrow
encryption. The meeting of June 26-28 in Paris, scheduled to take a firm
decision about the possibility of law enforcement agencies to read
electronic mail of private individuals and corporations, didn't succeed to
act on a compromise. The OECD's general secretary has no special power to
draw regulations and must find a common policy on the matter.
Sources said the OECD has been set apart between "the key escrow group" --
mainly USA, France and Britain -- and the "laxist" group -- mainly Japan
and Europe's Scandinavian countries like Sweden, Denmark and Finland
(Germany was still uncertain).
A press release of the OECD says that no final decisions were made. There
will be no other comment of the case. "The OECD experts grappled with
achieving a balance between respect of national sovereignty and developing
an international approach.  This dialogue will be continued at a third
meeting of the group, scheduled to take place on 26-27 September, in Paris.
An OECD spokeswoman said the organisation asked independant experts from
the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Washington, DC) to participate
in preliminary meetings. The EPIC prefers not to make any comment until the
next meeting in September.
Sources said the US were willing to "use" the OECD as a "policy laundering"
machine : to pressure the organisation in order to have the key escrow
policy approved by the 24 countries. US intelligence officials would have
been using it as a political weapon at home, where Congress,
public-interests groups and industry pressure groups are on the verge to
act against any key-escrow policy.

That was not a complaint -- but a modest report . Anyway, the major
countries which are to complaint about the US pressure are Japanese,
Australians, and Scandinavian countries, which are less keen to let
intelligence agencies controling individuals or industry secrets. France
and the UK, however, are sitting side by side with the US.
But I can add that my source is from the US :-) And that US business
circles around OECD discussions think no international guidelines could
emerge after any OECD meeting.

French Telco Act puts the Internet in leash
+ New rules regulating Internet content
+ First key-escrow encryption rules
As the Communications Decency Act was declared unconstitutional yesterday, June 12, the French Parliament (Senate and Assembly) passed a kind of Telco Act a la francaise last week, June 7. This law, aimed at providing new regulations for the telecommunications market (including the end of telephone monopoly in 1998), stresses two interesting points for Internet users : 1) a kind of CDA amendement was introduced en force in the Senate on Wednesday, June 5, just two days before it was voted Friday, at 3 in the morning. 2) the law establishes the first ever key escrow encryption rules created in industrialised countries. It will create trusted third parties (TTPs), private companies taht would keep encryption keys in custody for law enforcement purposes. It turns out that before the vote of the law, French military circles had already choosen which firms would be well suited to be TTP : Alcatel, Sagem and Bertin. All of them are well connected to the French military complex, and !
are all big defense contractors.
The amendment number 200 in the Loi sur la Reglementation des Telecommunications (LRT) was sponsored by French Senator Larcher and introduced by French telmecom minister Francois Fillon. At first glance, it depenalizes Internet Access Providers for the content of text, images and documents that they are transmitted. But there is an IF. The condition stresses on that they must conform to future recommendations that will be establish by a French government's council : the Comite Superieur de la Telematique. Created in February 1993, the CST has a mission of regulation of Minitel services (text and voice based services), through a professional code of ethics. The CST will no longer depends upon the French telecom ministry, but will be placed under the tutelage of another famous regulation watchdog : the CSA (A for audiovisuel - a kind of French FCC), aimed at regulating radio and TV broadcasts.
The law makes clear that if IAPs don't respond to "black" lists of Internet sites or newsgroups (in case where these sites may be in opposition to French law), the IAP will be held responsible for what it is carrying. These lists will be set up by the CST. Internet organisations and professionnals are scheduled to be members of the new CST -- today, in its "Minitel" form, it has 20 members, magistrates, ministry officials, France Telecom reprsentatives, Minitel providers, family and consumer organisations...  So, the French amendment smells like the CDA, with the introduction of a so-called reprentative body. In the U.S. the IAP or ISP must control its content. In France this is a centralised body that will do the job. It feels that the French succeeded in what some in the US dreamt : to give the FCC the power to rate sites or content on the Internet. The French State, once again, plays the Big Mother (mother = the Republic) game with a huge sense of precipitation. Furthermore, the law broke in great haste -- and mess. Because before the amendment 200, telecom minister Fillon established an interministerial commission to work on guidlines and recommendations to enforce French law on the Internet. It came after a Jewish organisation sued IAPs for transmitting neo-nazi propaganda; and early in May, when 2 IAP directors were arrested for one day, and convicted, for transmission of pedophile pictures. The mess comes about because that Fillon didn't wait for the Commission : it was scheduled to publish a report on its work around June 15. Another mess concerns French pro-users organizations. The newly created French Chapter of the Internet Society (ISOC-France) decided, apparently with the government commission's consent, to organize a mailing list consultation on the issue. Another group, the AUI (Association of Internet users), published a report this week about ethics, Internet content selection, and so on. Both organizations were openly ignored by Fillon. He did this even after saying during various interviews that the problem of IAP legal responsability on the Internet will be the result of a "broad consensus".
It turns out, however, that a small pressure group of IAPs (the AFPI) were consulted Monday, June 2, and had the opportunity to read the amendment before its final review in the Senate. The IAPs are quite satisfied now, because they didn't want to be treated as "pedophiles" and "neo-nazi" anymore. But they will have to adopt the CST guidelines.
During my personnal inquiry of the CST last year, I found some clues to understanding how the CST has been working at regulating Minitel services. The CST has a surveillance assignment on the Minitel market (to ensure that each provider follows deontology principles written in his contract with France T�l�com). But surveillance operations are not organized by the CST, but by a small army of France Telecom spook agents in Bordeaux: they are 5 to 8 people regulating hundreds of thousands of services! It is no surprise to learn that France Telecom regularly intervenes in this choice, and that France Telecom itself is a big Minitel provider, through a lot of business affiliates. It turns out that theses spook agents are infiltrating private discussions in adult-oriented forums to check for indecent speech (which may be sanctionned by the CST). Here is what here in France we have inherited to regulate the Internet!
The second important point of this Telco Act concerns encryption. France was already the first country in the OECD to forbid an individual to use any crypto system not approved by the French authorities (ie, the military). Thus, PGP-like software were, de facto, forbidden. The new law introduces the first key-escrow regulation. It frees cryptography use ONLY for digital signature; but to ensure privacy of email messages, however, the liberation of use is under condition : to give encryption keys to a so-called TTP. Some confidential reports in the press said that one or three private companies are already on the list to serve as TTPs for the French government. The first is Bertin & Co., an engineering company that has some competence in cryptography, and the others seem to be Alcatel-Alsthom (a big industrial conglomerate in telecommunications, defense and public-works engineering), and Sagem, another telecom conglomerate. It seems clear that all of these companies were choose!
n according to their defense expertise and good relations with the French military. The mess is that these choices, if confirmed, have been made before the vote on the law, and even before "applications decrees" were published (they may be prepared this summer).
France has no NSA. But some big ideas. (During the oil crisis in the 70's, a government commercial stated : "In France we have no oil. But we have good ideas".)

PARIS, September 16 ï¿½ The international developement of the Internet leads
governments, users organisations and corporations to find a compromise for
the use and disposal of encryption, which allows to keep the secrecy of
digital communications.
Governments want to keep the possibility to intervene on communications in
order to fight computer crime. The industry (private companies) search a
way to keep an eye on their communications' integrity not to erode their
competitivity. And privacy organisations want to preserve citizens' privacy
and freedom of speech in expression networks such as the Internet.
Before a meeting of governmental experts (under the auspices of the OECD
Sept 26, 27 in Paris), the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington, DC-based organisation, asked scientists, international right
jurists and associations to meet on September 25 for a conference.
The conference will stresses on legal aspects of computer-based secrecy,
based on propositions made by some countris to create a regime of
"encryption under conditions" (encryption under control), on the Trusted
Third Party Services (TTP) scheme. Companies that will keep encryption keys
of corporations and individuals would have to keep them at disposition of
law enforcement authorities. Who will play this TTP role? Which garanty for
end users? EPIC asked the world's most valuable experts to answer these

THE SUPREME COURT HAS SOME CLUES ON KNOCKING DOWN THE CDA
Well before the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on the constitutionality
of the CDA, David Sobel, EPIC's legal counsel, reminded the electronic
community that the Court handed down a decisive decision two years ago.
Excerpts from the EPIC Alert 4.04 newsletter herewith:

To avoid potential criminal liability under the CDA's "indecency"
provision, information providers would, in effect, be required to verify
the identities and ages of all recipients of material that might be deemed
inappropriate for children. If upheld, the statutory regime would thus
result in the creation of "registration records" for tens of thousands of
Internet sites, containing detailed descriptions of information accessed by
particular recipients. These records would be accessible to law enforcement
agencies and prosecutors investigating alleged violations of the statute.
Such a regime would constitute a gross violation of Americans' rights to
access information privately and anonymously.
Two years ago, the Supreme Court upheld the right to anonymous speech in
McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission. EPIC believes that the Court's
rationale in that case applies with even greater force to the Internet
"indecency" provisions now under review. The Court noted in McIntyre that:
" The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic
or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a
desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible. ...
"Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. It thus
exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights, and of the First
Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation
