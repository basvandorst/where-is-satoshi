@_subject: LiveCD For Testing 
I'm currently seeding a rather large experimental Tor/TorK LiveCD (675 MB!).
The CD is based on Knoppix and was created using the procedure documented at:
The only part of the procedure not fully implemented is 'Removing unnecessary packages'. I drew up a shortlist on the wiki page this morning, so if anyone can think of other worthy removals, please add them there.
I understand that without a full diff from knoppix sources the LiveCD is mystery meat and not particularly GPL compliant to boot. I think this is something to address in the medium term, when/if it ever begins to take shape as a serious proposition. I believe the Knoppix sources are available at:  I have about 40KB/s TX bandwidth on my home connection, so if you manage a full download please continue to seed.
Elements of the CD that need some attention:
* Firefox - firefox sessions load from tork with pretty much everything disabled. The next version will have Mike Perry's torbutton - which looks like the most sensible way of doing things. I also haven't attempted to strip any plugins yet.
* Firewall - just a basic firewall is used. No attempt is made to block outgoing dns requests. Instead these are tracked and reported in a very rudimentary, not-exactly-foolproof way by tork. I guess this comes down to whether an anonymous cd should permit non-anonymous browsing.
* Policy on software included. What applications should the CD include? Should the user want/be able to print? Should there be more than one type of CD offered, full featured vs just browsing?
* Are there security features that the wiki page doesn't even mention or Anyway, be gentle! I'll probably try to create a new and improved version of the CD every few weeks for the next while.
