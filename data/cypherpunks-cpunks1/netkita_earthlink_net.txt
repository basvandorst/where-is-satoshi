I can't remember EVER hearing of someone slashing just ONE wrist. It is a given     that both are done.Sounds too odd to be true.

@_subject: Remember 9/11 
This I feel is very unfair. While I do think that the Fbi and Secret Service could be closed and their tasks combined and given over to the NSA ,Marines and other law enforcement agencies, I think that overall the agencies did the best they could. It is hard to break cells. If you remember historically that the Weathermen aka the Weather underground succeeded because of their overwhelming similarities. therefore they bonded. They were of diverse religions BUT .. they were all of the same socio economic background,educated same politics,same age. It is very hard to infiltrate cells if not impossible. Cells consist of only 5 or less people and do not know the activities of others.Therefore if the other cells do not know the activities of others , then how can a law enforcement agency.

To date how many members of the  Cypherpunks mailing list are in the can so to     speak and what are the category of offenses that the government wishes to blame     them with? What are the dates or at least the years that they were arrested?
    Thanks in Advance,
