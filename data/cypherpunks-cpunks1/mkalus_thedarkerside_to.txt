Of course the little thing you are overlooking is that if this would happen the Spinmeisters would manage to turn it into another terrorist treat (which in a strict sense it is) and yank even more civil rights.
And knowing the majority of people: they just happily go along.
Or differently: This would backfire.... Badly.

That might have been. But he was not, and he is shown and "paraded" on TV (and don't tell me he wasn't because showing a man in his state, showing how he gets examined is clearly an attempt to "break the morale").
Most people outside of the US are blissfully aware of this. After all they had bombs dropped on them for the last 50 years, being shot at by people that were founded by the US Government (have a look at South America) and so forth.
It is almost astonishing to hear arguments like these. You (and people who make these arguments) sound like the kid who gets smacked after burning down the house and then starting to cry and call foul.
So you advocate to "follow Bin Ladin"? If you (as in the US Government) consider him evil, then following him and do the same way he does makes you evil as well.
Having said that: What makes you the "good guy"?
Of course Libya is evil when it doesn't fit into the US foreign policy, but is a "good friend' when you can send someone there to get "vital information". If that involves torture than this is none of your business.
It is sort of ironic that a state like the US can claim no interrest in how the information was obtained and cheerfully extorts people to countries where they know very clearly that those people will be tortured. It seems not even another passport (like say, Canadian) is protecting those people from the wrath and zeal of the US Administration and their henchman.
If the Henchman happens to wear a turban while doing his deed, it is fine, as long as it is done under US Supervision, which can be denied if need be.
The UN is a meeting chamber. The UN is an ability for countries to meet and try to find solutions that do not involve dropping heavy explosives on other peoples head.
The UN also fails regularly because heavy weights like the US use it to throw their weight around. If there would be a proportional (as in number of people living in a country) representation the tables would turn very very quickly.
The UN security council should be dropped in it's current form and instead should be re-created without any permanent members or any countries power to veto the decisions.
It is not the leaders of most countries I am afraid of. It is the leaders of a handful of countries which possess the most power and have no problem in abusing it to further their own agenda.

No I did not omit this little bit. This is not the question.
Guilt or not guilt is not (supposely) decided when captured but in a court of law. You remember, "Justice" the thing the US supposely is standing for?
Whatever he did before, it does not matter at this point. At this very moment the people who have to abide are the victors and that means the US Government (and thus the US Military).
Two wrongs still don't make a right.

According to the US Government though they are not soldiers. They are "unlawful enemy combattants".
The war in Afghanistan is over. This is were they were caught. Thus they should be released, no? If they are terrorists and they have proof of this they should put them in front of a court (and I guess that should be a civil court, not a military tribunal as I don't quite see since when the US Army is performing law enforcement duties).
But they are not POWs by their own account. If they could be charged with any of these crimes above, then what takes two years to actually convict them?
Some of them ARE US Citizens. Others are citizens of other states. International Law means that if I (holding a German passport) have to be allowed to contact MY government in order to receive any aid that I might require. This right has not been given.
Granted, I would not be protected under the rights of the US constitution, but I do have other rights and those are clearly violated as well.
Treason would need to be proofen. Considering that no charges have been brought forward after almost two years it is pretty clear (or at least appears to be) that there is no proof that any of these people did anything wrong.
It doesn't. But if that would be the case than the captured Afghans should be returned to the Afghan authorities, why is this not happening?
May as it be, but that still doesn't make the actions of the US Government right. Or are you telling me right now that Guantanamo Bay and Diego Garcia are part of a humanitarian mission?

I only tell you what they are telling us. I do not agree with this assessment personally.
Where the war begun is probably debatable. The US had (and has) their fingerprints over a lot of things that are happening. And all of these you could construe as an act of war.
But the regime has been replaced, thus the war is over, no? That was the case in Europe. Germany was defeated, a new government installed (with a lot of people from the old one) and you called it "done deal". Same in Japan. So what's different this time?
I am answering to your statements. We have already established that if they are POWs then they should be released because the war is over (see above). If they are not POWs but held because of terrorist charges, than they should be tried no?
Our "enlightened" western society, led by the USofA who proclaims to know what right and wrong is (and who wants to teach it to all those "primitive" cultures in the middle east).
Sure sure, nobody has flown another plane in a building. Is this because of the US Army and all those nifty security screenings at the airport (just last weekend I flew out of Dallas and saw more than enough ways to get something through security), or because nobody really wanted to do it right now? Guess we'll never know. But of course the Spinmeisters are going to say it's because of the war in Iraq and added security. I wonder who or what they are going to blame the next time someone gets blown up.
Nifty, isn't it? "Well people, we see your point. But you have to Understanding, even though we control Guantanamo Bay and even though Diego Garcia is a British Island which we just annexed, we can't really do anything to help those poor people. But don't fret, if they would be in an Afghani jail they would be off worse. Remember, we are the good guys, we only do what's in humanities best interrest."
If they would be held in New York State they would have more rights. So let's just not even try that, we might actually HAVE to treat them according to the gospel that we preach.
That's not what I said. What I DID say was that if they are not POWs and are not charged with a crime, they should be set free.
See above.
The term "unlawful combatants" doesn't exist either. So the question is mute. Let's say "Human being" instead.
Than you have a problem with your government. But neither British, nor Canadian nor French authorities were notified / could be contact OR, after they found out, were allowed to talk to their people.
It is not only about people from Afghanistan, it is also about other countries, see my text above.
There have been several reports. What about John Walker? Whatever happened to him?

Ah? Why?
The US makes these claims on their own. If they are the "good guys" than they should act like it. Not only when it is convenient but also when it is not. Morale is not about the "best bang for the buck" but about integrity. The US Government clearly does not possess a lot of integrity when it comes to morale.
Last time I checked I was a human being.
Televising this for propaganda purposes.
No, what I am saying is that no matter what he did, the US still has to play by international rules (or should at least). Using those images from Saddam as Propaganda clearly is wrong.

No, but it is very interresting that all of this didn't matter while Saddam was the "good guy" for our causes (and by that I mean the Western world general).
To use those people as a reason to wage war (even if the outcome would better their lives and the votes on this is still out) still has moral implications, and if it is only by the sanctions that did nothing to prevent those cruelties from happening but actually adding more to their daily lives.
I don't know about you. But I know that if I would have lost family members in the past 12 years because of Sanctions and Saddam I would (at best) find the current arguments FOR the war (if I would know about them) more than cynical.

Am I? The west traded heavily with him, be it the US, France, Germany, the UK. Nobody was left out. All dealt with Saddam and made a lot of money off of him.
Who is "you lot"?
So in September 1980, Hussein's troops crossed the border into Iran. At first the war went well for Iraq, but eventually Iranian forces pushed the invaders out of their country. By spring 1982, the Iranians had gone on the offensive. And that greatly worried the Reagan White House, knowing that an Iranian victory could have a disastrous effect on America's power base in the oil-rich Middle East.
Before long the Reagan administration began openly courting Saddam Hussein. In 1982, the United States removed Iraq from its list of countries that supported state-sponsored terrorism. In December 1983, President Reagan sent to Baghdad none other than Donald Rumsfeld, then special envoy to the Middle East and today one of Hussein's harshest critics as U.S. secretary of defense. Rumsfeld's visit opened up America's relations with Iraq for the first time since the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. Later, Rumsfeld said that "it struck us as useful to have a relationship" and revealed that Hussein had indicated he wasn't interested in causing problems in the world.
Does the " mean anything to you? He was our "good guy" as long as we though we could use him.
I think the circumstances where a bit different at this point in time. Besides. Nobody (at least not I) said anything about "supporting" him or "cheering" for Saddam. The Question here is not if he is a bad man or a good man. It is not if he did or did not do what they accuse him of. But it is about the double morale that the west has been advocating for the past 50 years. Especially when it comes to Oil.
It is astonishing that it was okay for Saddam to be as evil as be and we (as a society) turned a blind eye to it, until WE (for whatever reason) felt threatened by him and than dragged it all out again, just to proof how bad he is. Face it. If the West didn't want Saddam in Power they could have removed him a long time ago. The matter of fact is, we are as much to blame for what happened to the people in Iraq as is Saddam, if not more so.
So where do your enlightened Western Politicians fit in? Good or Evil?
I suggest you read Chomsky's new book, and if only as a reference to the sources he lists.
No, but it leads good men to become evil. If you ally with the enemy than you are giving up what makes you good. Turning away when someone is abused doesn't make the abuse stop and it makes you just as guilty as the one who commits the abuse.
Ignorance might be bliss for most people, but from an ethical and moral standpoint it is not.
Parading Saddam around and humiliating him just shows how low we really are, despite the fact that we don't want to acknowledge it ourselves.

From the same site I linked to before:
By January 1984, /The Washington Post/ was reporting that the United States had told friendly nations in the Persian Gulf that the defeat of Iraq would "be contrary to U.S. interests." That sent the message that America would not object to U.S. allies offering military aid to Iraq. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait sent howitzers, bombs and other weapons to Iraq. And later that year the U.S. government pushed through sales of helicopters to Hussein's government.
But that was just the beginning of Reagan's pro-Iraq campaign. The United States sold the Iraqis military jeeps and Lockheed L-100 transports. And, according to a recent report in /The New York Times/, as many as 60 American intelligence officers provided Iraq with "critical battle planning assistance," lending detailed information on Iranian deployments, plans for airstrikes and bomb-damage assessments. The /Times/ story further reported that this intelligence assistance was offered even though American officers knew the Iraqi commanders would probably use chemical weapons against the Iranians.
The military aid helped Iraq hold off the Iranians, and the war dragged on until 1988. That year the U.S. Senate passed the Prevention of Genocide Act, which would have imposed sanctions against Hussein's regime. But the Reagan White House opposed the bill, calling it premature. When it eventually passed, the White House made little effort to enforce it.
Just because they didn't sell the weapons directly doesn't mean they didn't sell them. It is an age old practice to sell weapons to a middle man in order to get them where they are not supposed to be.
And in regards to arms sales:
    * U.S. arms exports in 1995 amounted to $15.6 billion, three times
      that of the next supplier and 49 percent of the world's. Over the
      1993-1995 period, U.S. exports went equally to developed and
      developing countries.
    * The six next largest suppliers, with over $0.5 billion each and
      together accounting for 42 percent of the world total, were:
U.K. 	$5.2 billion 	Germany 	1.2
Russia 	3.3 	Israel 	0.8
France 	2.2 	China, Mainland 	0.6
    * The Middle East imported over 30 percent of the total number of
      major weapons in trade over the last 12 years (1984-1995). In
      1993-1995, Western Europe became the main importing region with 32
      percent.
*Kroft. *And other arms dealers and countries did. Brazil provided thousands of armored vehicles. China and the Soviet Union sent tanks, missiles and munitions. German companies sold Saddam poison gas technology, and France, not only approved the sale of artillery to Iraq, but [also sold] armed helicopters and antiaircraft missile systems.
This Chilean arms manufacturer [shown on screen] sold Saddam deadly cluster bombs--reportedly with technical assistance from U.S. companies, and the United States allowed American computer technology to go to Iraq as well. It allowed Sarkis to sell Hughes and Bell helicopters. The U.S. government approved the sale after Iraq promised that they would only be used for civilian purposes. Sarkis told us that the helicopters were used as transportation during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
*Sarkis. *I did it with the knowledge of U.S. authorities, policy makers--and also they have delivered weapons that are equally weapons as I did. I do not have anything on my conscience. I did not sell the weapons to kill the American boys.
*Kroft. *Which agencies of the U.S. government knew about Sarkis and his deals with Iraq? Well, according to Sarkis, almost all of them. And federal court documents show that Sarkis Soghanalian had a relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies for decades, and has performed work on their behalf.
Not all of Sarkis's deals with Iraq involve weapons. He arranged the sale of $280 million in uniforms to the Iraqi army. And Sarkis's partners in the deal included former Vice President Spiro Agnew, a former Attorney General, Colonel Jack Brennan.
The partners used their influence to get ex-President Nixon to provide them with these letters of introduction [shown on screen] to heads of state around the world.
[To Sarkis] Do you think there was anything unusual about a former Vice President and a former Attorney General and a former Chief of Staff for the President of the United Stateas to want to be selling military uniforms to the Iraqis?
*Sarkis. *They were not only in the uniform business. They would sell their mothers if they could, just to make the money.
The word "directly" is missing here.
That may be, but they also had Hughes Helicopters (see quote above) as well as other weapons that clearly came from the US. The US was very well aware of what Saddam had because if they didn't sell it to him directly they at least acted as facilitator. And so did pretty much Western Europe.
 From the TLC page again:
In December 1983, President Reagan sent to Baghdad none other than Donald Rumsfeld, then special envoy to the Middle East and today one of Hussein's harshest critics as U.S. secretary of defense. Rumsfeld's visit opened up America's relations with Iraq for the first time since the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. Later, Rumsfeld said that "it struck us as useful to have a relationship" and revealed that Hussein had indicated he wasn't interested in causing problems in the world.
So was apparantly Rumsfeld.
And the US was just drawn into it by accident?
No Government ever cared about the individual if greater gains could be amassed. Be it the US or any other country in the world.
BTW, can you provide me with a reference for the "dangling bodies'? Because I was unable to find anything on this so far.

that I would like to oppose. It is rather the fact that in the past it wasn't very feasible. The world is getting smaller. People can fly airplanes now in every part of the world. What you see happening right now is what happened back in the late 1800s and in the early 20th century when the colonies started to rise up.
The difference this time around is that the oppressed have the ability to strike back where it hurts: In the homeland.
None of the colonial powers got away with it forever, sooner or later the price was too high and to think that the US is above the lesson learned it will be in for a rude awakening.
Still... I wouldn't count on it though. China is picking up steam, the EU is expanding and the fight over Iraq let Europe to move closer together, not further apart.
Aznar and Berlusconi did what they did because they tried to have a voice in the EU that was mightier than it really is (they are afraid to loose subsidies when the EU expands eastward). Berlusconi also is on a power trip and tries to become the next Duce in Italy.
Chances are neither of them will survive for much longer. Even with the Berlusconi controlled media in Italy people took notice.

Yet you still think there was a good reason to Oppose the Vietnam war? Make up your mind man. Was it a "just" war like (in your opinion) Iraq right now or was it unjust?
Because, if we claim to be humane, do these wars for the greater good, we better act like it. (By it i mean the West in general). If we don't then we better shut the fuck up about our 'ideals" and how everybody should live by them. Why do you think we're such a target?

It is your kind of Arrogance that causes wars like one in Iraq right now. It is arrogance like yours that makes millions suffer without you even notice. There were a million more places where an intervention would have done any good. Yet in none of these places do we see anybody (Ivory Coast anyone?)
Why does the "american way of life" have to win? What is it about the "american way" that has to win? The ability to dream of maybe becoming rich one day? The american dream and lifestyle has just as much right to "win" as any other. There is no "right" in any of these.
Sammdam and the two towers had nothing to do with each other. That for Second of all. Did they had it coming? Yes. It was only a question of time until something like this would have happened. The fact that the majority refused to see it has nothing to do with it.

Indications Saddam Was Not in Hiding But a Captive
DEBKAfile Special Report
December 14, 2003, 6:55 PM (GMT+02:00)
A number of questions are raised by the incredibly bedraggled, tired and crushed condition of this once savage, dapper and pampered ruler who was discovered in a hole in the ground on Saturday, December 13:
1. The length and state of his hair indicated he had not seen a barber or even had a shampoo for several weeks.
2. The wild state of his beard indicated he had not shaved for the same 3. The hole dug in the floor of a cellar in a farm compound near Tikrit was primitive indeed b 6ft across and 8ft across with minimal sanitary arrangements - a far cry from his opulent palaces.
4. Saddam looked beaten and hungry.
5. Detained trying to escape were two unidentified men. Left with him were two AK-47 assault guns and a pistol, none of which were used.
6. The hole had only one opening. It was not only camouflaged with mud and bricks b it was blocked. He could not have climbed out without someone on the outside removing the covering.
7. And most important, $750,000 in 100-dollar notes were found with him (a pittance for his captors who expected a $25m reward)b but no communications equipment of any kind, whether cell phone or even a carrier pigeon for contacting the outside world.
According to DEBKAfile analysts, these seven anomalies point to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein was not in hiding; he was a prisoner.
After his last audiotaped message was delivered and aired over al Arabiya TV on Sunday November 16, on the occasion of Ramadan, Saddam was seized, possibly with the connivance of his own men, and held in that hole in Adwar for three weeks or more, which would have accounted for his appearance and condition. Meanwhile, his captors bargained for the $25 m prize the Americans promised for information leading to his capture alive or dead. The negotiations were mediated by Jalal Talabanibs Kurdish PUK militia.
These circumstances would explain the ex-rulerbs docility b described by Lt.Gen. Ricardo Sanchez as bresignationb b in the face of his capture by US forces. He must have regarded them as his rescuers and would have greeted them with relief.
 From Gen. Sanchezbs evasive answers to questions on the $25m bounty, it may be inferred that the Americans and Kurds took advantage of the negotiations with Saddambs abductors to move in close and capture him on their own account, for three reasons:
A. His capture had become a matter of national pride for the Americans. No kudos would have been attached to his handover by a local gang of bounty-seekers or criminals. The country would have been swept anew with rumors that the big hero Saddam was again betrayed by the people he trusted, just as in the war.
B. It was vital to catch his kidnappers unawares so as to make sure Saddam was taken alive. They might well have killed him and demanded the prize for his body. But they made sure he had no means of taking his own life and may have kept him sedated.
C. During the weeks he is presumed to have been in captivity, guerrilla activity declined markedly b especially in the Sunni Triangle towns of Falluja, Ramadi and Balad - while surging outside this flashpoint region b in Mosul in the north and Najef, Nasseriya and Hilla in the south. It was important for the coalition to lay hands on him before the epicenter of the violence turned back towards Baghdad and the center of the Sunni Triangle.
The next thing to watch now is not just where and when Saddam is brought to justice for countless crimes against his people and humanity - - Sanchez said his interrogation will take bas long as it takes b but what happens to the insurgency. Will it escalate or gradually die down?
An answer to this, according to DEBKAfilebs counter-terror sources, was received in Washington nine days before Saddam reached US custody.
It came in the form of a disturbing piece of intelligence that the notorious Lebanese terrorist and hostage-taker Imad Mughniyeh, who figures on the most wanted list of 22 men published by the FBI after 9/11, had arrived in southern Iraq and was organizing a new anti-US terror campaign to be launched in March-April 2004, marking the first year of the American invasion.
For the past 21 years, Mughniyeh has waged a war of terror against Americans, whether on behalf of the Hizballah, the Iranian Shiite fundamentalists, al Qaeda or for himself. The Lebanese arch-terrorist represents for the anti-American forces in Iraq an ultimate weapon.
Saddambs capture will not turn this offensive aside; it may even bring it forward.
For Israel, there are three lessons to be drawn from the dramatic turn of events in Iraq:
First, An enemy must be pursued to the end and if necessary taken captive. The Sharon governmentbs conduct of an uncertain, wavering war against the Palestinian terror chief Yasser Arafat stands in stark contrast to the way the Americans have fought Saddam and his cohorts in Iraq and which has brought them impressive gains.
Second, Israel must join the US in bracing for the decisive round of violence under preparation by Mughniyeh, an old common enemy from the days of Beirut in the 1980s. Only three weeks ago, DEBKAfilebs military sources reveal, the terrorist mastermind himself was seen in south Lebanon in surveillance of northern Israel in the company of Iranian military officers. With this peril still to be fought, it is meaningless for Israelis to dicker over the Geneva Accord, unilateral steps around the Middle East road map, or even the defensive barrier.
Third, Certain Israeli pundits and even politicians, influenced by opinion in Europe, declared frequently in recent weeks that the Americans had no hope of capturing Saddam Hussein and were therefore bogged down irretrievably in Iraq. The inference was that the Americans erred in embarking on an unwinnable war in Iraq.
This was wide of the mark even before Saddam was brought in. The Americans are in firm control - even though they face a tough new adversary b and the whole purpose of the defeatist argument heard in Israel was to persuade the Sharon government that its position in relation to the Palestinians and Yasser Arafat is as hopeless as that of the Americans in Iraq. Israelbs only choice, according to this argument, is to knuckle under to Palestinian demands and give them what they want. Now that the Iraqi ruler is in American custody, they will have to think again.
b14 December
Commander of US ground forces in Iraq, Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, said at the dramatic news conference in Baghdad (Bremer: We Got him!), that Saddam Hussein was discovered in a bspider holeb 6-8ft deep behind a mud hut in a walled farm compound in Adwar, a town 15 km from Tikrit, eight months after his regime was toppled.
His capture was achieved without a shot fired and no injuries. He was emaciated, tired and unkempt and had grown a gray beard. The initial medical examination was videotaped and aired. He was then shaved for identification. Found with him were two AK-47 assault rifles and $750,000. Two associates were detained with him. A ventilator enabled them to stay underground. The hole in which Saddam was hiding was camouflaged with bricks and dirt.
Operation bRed Dawnb was carried by 4th Infantry Division and coalition special forces b 600 men. It was made possible by a great deal of human intelligence and the interrogation of captives.
Gen. Sanchez reported the deposed Iraqi ruler, discovered Saturday, December 13, at 8.30 pm local time, showed no resistance and appeared resigned to his fate. He was btalkative and cooperativeb while being taken to a secure place. The interrogation will btake as long as it takes.b
US administrator Paul Bremer called on the Iraqi people to turn to reconciliation and Saddambs followers to lay down their arms.
US troops poured into Baghdad and blocked the road-bridges into the capital as soon as word spread, in anticipation of violence from Saddam fedayeen or foreign terrorists fighting the US-led coalition presence. Baghdadis fired guns in the air to celebrate the capture of the man who ruled the country with an iron fist for 23 years. Kurdish and Shiite towns filled with dancing and jubilation. Iraq officials demand Saddam be handed over to the new Iraqi war crimes tribunal to be judged for the murder of 300,000 Iraqis.

The German law clearly defines what is hate speech. It is not an easy task as you can see in a six month trial.

Then I guess you better start liberating the world. Pretty much any country in the world has a law against hate speech.
All symbols that are related to Nazism. One of the reasons (if not the reason) why they banned "Wolfenstein 3D".
They could actually until ~ 10 years ago. Germany (even though considered independend) wasn't. By international law a piece was never brokered, it was just a cease fire.
Of course now they could, but Germany still is a bit jumpy about it's Nice... So in the US you have :
- - Walmart which censors music to make it "clean".
- - Blockbuster who edits movies (or has in the past, not sure if they still do)
- - TV Stations who edit movies
- - Censors at TV stations who "watch" over the programming.
- - What about the FCC who restricts what can be aired?
I agree.
I agree again, but the problem is that even in the good ol'e US of A it is not tested.
Doubtful. I don't have an issue with discussion if both sides can get their say. I do not agree that driving people like Nazis into the underground accomplishes anything. Their ideas have to be looked at in the light and then society can answer.
Problem with that is: 99% of people give a fuck about discussion or ideas. they want to be told what to do.

To my understanding Historical documents are exempt from this.
Wolfenstein was banned in the end because the symbols where used in If it is a historical drama in which the Symbols appear this seems to be permissible as well. If you put one on your jacket though and walk around with it in the streets they can get you.

It isn't quite that easy.
It is not like any cop can just arrest you, drag you away and lock you up because he thinks you did something wrong.
The way this would work out is that someone would have to report you (as the offender) to the cops, they in turn would contact the "Verfassungschutz" which then would investigate and if they consider that something is up they can ask a judge for a warrant.
In reality though is there was a huge outcry last year in Germany. A rather right wing party called "NDP" as well as several "Wehrsportgruppen" which (according to the Verfassungschutz) were extremely right and attacking the German consitution, were in effect actually LED by informants of the Verfassungschutz. What this means is: They build the monster they were supposed to "protect" us from.
The whole thing still isn't over, Politicians from all colours ask loudly if Germany actually still needs the Verfassungsschutz. That the singer got jailed has happened independently from each other, but to think that the majority of people in Germany are just sheep is as wrong as the idea that all of Germans are Nazis.
I find it always interesting how people (especially from the US) seem to have prefabricated ideas about how other countries are, but are at the same time so much in denial about their own society that it is just One huge difference I have noticed between the US and Germany in particular is that discussions LIKE these are still happening in the mainstream press, not only in the "left" or "right" wing propaganda It might be interresting to note BTW, that the german mainstream right is that mainly likes to use the Verfassungschutz, not so much the left who accepts it but is a lot more critical of it than for example the Bavarian Government. That might have to do with the little fact that in the mid 70s and 80s the left was the main target of them (think Rote Armee Fraktion).

the problem with your attitude is that it results in a "me me me" approach.
If mankind would act that way we would have been extinct a long time ago. A single human being is a rather weak individual. There isn't much we could have done.
Only after we managed to work together as a society we were able to "conquer" the planet, and most likely ultimatly destroy it for all forms of life.
Even though I do not agree with people sitting on their asses and not working, I do not think that we should turn our backs to them and ignore them. If society casts out the weakest as a strategie of survival than something here is horribly wrong.
Your Stereotyping doesn't really help either to make your point as they are just simply painting black and white, and literally meaning it that way.
Quality of Life has nothing to do with how much money you make, but how you live your life. This seems to be something that is slowly forgotten in the western world, especially north america.

Statement on H.R. 2417
Statement by the President
Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2417, the "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004." The Act authorizes funding for United States intelligence activities, including activities in the war against terrorists of global reach.
Section 506A(c) of the National Security Act of 1947, as enacted by section 312(b) of the Act, purports to require the President to request that the Congress enact laws appropriating funding for a major intelligence system procurement in an amount set as a cost estimate by an entity subordinate to the President or to explain why the President instead requests amounts below those levels. Moreover, beginning with the submittal to the Congress of the President's budget for FY 2006, section 312(d)(2) of H.R. 2417 purports to condition the obligation or expenditure of funds for development or procurement of a major intelligence system on the President's compliance with the requirements of section 506A. The executive branch shall construe these provisions in a manner consistent with the Constitution's commitment to the President of exclusive authority to submit for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient and to supervise the unitary executive branch, and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair the deliberative processes of the Executive or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
Section 341(b) purports to require the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence, acting through particular offices subordinate to them respectively, to establish certain policies and procedures relating to espionage prosecutions. The executive branch shall implement this provision in a manner consistent with the authority committed exclusively to the President by the Constitution to faithfully execute the laws and to supervise the unitary executive branch. Similarly, sections 1102(a) and 1102(c) of the National Security Act, as enacted by section 341(a) of the Act, purport to mandate that the Director of Central Intelligence use or act through the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive to establish and implement an inspection process for all agencies and departments of the U.S. Government that handle classified information. The executive branch shall implement this provision in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive The executive branch shall construe and implement section 376 of the Act, relating to making available classified information to courts, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to classify and control access to information bearing on the national security and consistent with the statutory authority of the Attorney General for the conduct of litigation for the United States.
Many provisions of the Act, including section 106 and subtitle D of title III of the Act, seek to require the executive branch to furnish information to the Congress on various subjects. The executive branch shall construe the provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
The executive branch shall implement section 319 of the Act in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Section 502 purports to place restrictions on use of the U.S. Armed Forces and other personnel in certain operations. The executive branch shall construe the restrictions -in section 502 as advisory in nature, so that the provisions are consistent with the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, including for the conduct of intelligence operations, and to supervise the unitary executive branch.
Section 106 enacts by reference certain requirements set forth in the joint explanatory statement of the House-Senate committee of conference or in a classified annex. The executive branch continues to discourage this practice of enacting secret laws and encourages instead appropriate non-binding uses of classified schedules of authorizations, classified annexes to committee reports, and joint statements of managers that accompany the final legislation.

Replace "Government" with "Society" and you're getting somewhere. Where will your brand new sports car go when you don't have a road to drive on? Who will pay the cops when there are no taxes being collected?
The business though benefits extremly from the infrastructure that is build with taxes. Plus a lot of companies can exempt even more money, so in essence a lot of companies don't pay a dime in taxes.
Yes, the poorer are working and contributing to the Riches. Always Remember: YOU stand on the backs of those who you despise so much.

Also, you forgot Fred. Fred is the guy who works for Alice, supposly only 40 hours a week, but they are short staffed as Alice needs to make sure that her investors get a "good bang for the buck" so Fred has been in reality working more to 70 hours a week and hasn't really seen his kids anymore. He is only paid for 40 hours though as Alice explained to Fred that she just doesn't have the money to pay for overtime.
Then Fred gets sick, but Alice didn't provide any benefits (after all she needs to make a profit for the shareholders), thus Fred has to get by what he has saved up while hoping that the government would give him some money.
blah blah blah. The world is so unfair to you. You just can't get a good slave anymore these days for nothing.
Fred is doing the real work, and gets a kick in the butt by Alice the moment he is not "worth" enough anymore.
You, of course, still carry the idea that everybody has the right to be rich. That the World doesn't have infinite resources nor that the money is an infinite resources is ignored by the likes of you. After all you have made it on the backs of all the Freds out there.

SAO PAULO - Brazilian police photographed and fingerprinted all arriving Americans on Thursday - tit-for-tat for a similar US program that begins next week.
In all, 230 American citizens were thus identified Thursday at Brazil's largest international airport here under what a federal police spokesman called a "judicial decision."
That decision was handed down earlier in the week by Judge Julier Sebastiao da Silva of the federal bench in the central Brazilian city of Mato Grosso based on "the principle of reciprocity," although it could still be annulled by the federal government.
The identification measures were not immediately put into effect  at the airport in Rio de Janeiro, where federal police said they had not yet received official instructions, according to the Brazilian press agency, Agencia Brasil.
Beginning January 5, immigration officials at all US international airports will vet visitors' passports and visas and pose the usual questions - before taking their fingerprints and photographs.
That is phase one of US-VISIT, a 380-million-dollar effort to track down terrorists. Visitors from 27 countries whose citizens do  not need visas to enter the United States - mostly in Europe, are exempted.
By 2005, every port-of-entry on land, sea and air will have the fingerprint and photographic technology. All US visas and passports  will eventually include photos and fingerprints - called "biometric The program takes effect after the United States raised its terror alert to its next-to-highest level in December. Intelligence  indicated that al-Qaeda was planning to hijack airliners for a repeat of its September 11 attacks in which 3,000 died.

Yes, the way this usually works is that the government builds the road, then sells it to a private company for some money and then the upkeep is handled by the company.
It is rather seldom that someone builds a road for a business venture.
Of course there is no oversight body, so if they use "excessive force" well, It's all part of doing business and after all they didn't smash YOUR skull so what do you care, right?
I don't have a link ready right now, but there were several US corporations as well as some in Germany who did NOT pay any taxes for the past couple of years because of either "breaks" they got so not to leave, OR because they posted such high losses that they did not post any profit on the books, thus not pay any taxes.
Assuming right now that you are living in Finland, i am wondering why you not move into the land of the free and do it without any social I guess it depends on which study you look.
If the Army / Homeland security costs more when run by the government than when run by private firms the US Army should be highly efficent. After all WITHOUT private contractors none of the personell would be fed (that is done by a french catering company), without the likes of Halliburton and such the US Army would not be in Iraq, the support is pretty much "outsourced" for greater "efficency" and "cost saving". Of course companies tend to overcharge quite a huge amount, but hey, I am sure at the end they are still cheaper, right?
What you fail to realize is that "you get what you pay for" and why would I want a company cut corners in things like social services, Security (i.e. police) or any other of these services only to save a buck or two?
If that is the mentality no wonder companies attach a value to human life and don't really care if you burn up in your car or get killed as long as it is cheaper than to fix a problem.
I guess that is also a reason why insurance rates for SUVs aren't up, while smaller cars are getting hit (Want to know why? Because if you die it is a one time payment and the insurance companies are off the hook. If you're just insured though, they pay a lot more to get you "fixed" again. SUVs tend to kill more people than maime them, thus by their logic they are cheaper).
But all of you who seem to think that social services et al, should be run on a profit maximiation basis, tell me this: How much are you worth in Dollars and cents (or Euros)? I would like to know how much you think you are worth to your friends, family, kids, spouses etc.?
