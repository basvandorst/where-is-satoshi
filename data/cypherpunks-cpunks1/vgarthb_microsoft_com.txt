It's my understanding that it's technically illegal for anyone to require
your SSN for anything if they are not using it for SS related purposes.
I had heard that congress passed a law when SSNs were issued to this
Am I hallucinating, or has someone else heard this too?!

@_subject: SSN Quandary (was: CreditCard info) 
I routinely refuse to give my SSN to agencies that have no
government affiliation. I've been hassled for this stance,
and frequently refused service/credit. My phone company
demanded an exorbitant deposit because I wouldn't give
them my SSN when signing for service.
I am greatly disturbed by the amount of personal information
currently available on an individual, and accessible with
keys as simple as SSN, full name, and mother's maiden name.
I, however, have no clue what to do other than continue to
refuse to supply data whenever possible.

i'm looking for info on enabling automatic PGP signing
of mail messages from PINE and ELM.
Perhaps i'm babbling about something in a FAQ i missed,
in which case i'll filter flames to /dev/null. =)

The author stated use of 8 processors and "aggressive vectorization",
or, IOW, Using the 8 processors in conjunction instead of as 8 separate
data paths, making their co-operative speed MUCH faster than
an 8X increase.
