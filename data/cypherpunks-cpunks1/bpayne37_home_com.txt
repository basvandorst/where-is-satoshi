MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR FILING ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION

 an intention to participate in electronic filing of pleadings and
documents in this case.

 Facsimile: (505) 768-7395
Exhibit A.
St. John is a defendant in this case.
St. John has not filed ENTRY OF APPEARANCE in this lawsuit.
St. John's filing ORDER is more than frivolous.  It is a malicious
intentional attempt to set the stage for
possible digital document alteration.
2  Lawyer St John writes
 3. In addition to serving on all parties, the parties shall file
directly with the
 Court, any motions, briefs in support, responsive briefs, reply briefs
and exhibits relating
 to them whether filed electronically on the ACE serve or in paper form.
with "shall file directly with the Court" high-lighted in bold text.
Paragraph 3 appears to be frivolous in that St. John appears to want
something from plaintiffs by bold
high-lighting which St. John does not explicitly state.
Plaintiff's have always filed directly with the court.
Paragraph 3 is frivolous.
3   Lawyer St John writes
 5. Upon completion of the briefing process, the movant shall file with
the Court
 and serve on all parties a ÂNotice of CompletionÂ specifically
identifying the pertinent
 motion ready for decision and any briefs or other documents which have
been filed relating
 to that motion.
St. John apparently writes this because of previous motion of plaintiff
Payne for filing MOTION FOR
SANCTIONS FOR FILING "NOTICE OF BRIEFING COMPLETION."
St. John attempts to overrule Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
St. John's paragraph 5 is frivolous.
4   Lawyer St John has the gall to have defendant magistrate Don F Svet
 IT IS SO ORDERED.
 Dated: June ____,2001.
 UNITED STATES JUDGE
Svet does not date filing.
5 St. John and the Rodey law firm by submitting ORDER WAIVING PACKET
REQUIREMENT TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING have established  pattern
and practice of
malicious intent to subvert the federal judicial process by the
frivolous ORDER.
Moreover, harassment is NOT  a federal question as recognized by New
Mexico state court.  Exhibit B.
6 Rule 11.  Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers;
Representations to Court; Sanctions
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states
 (b) Representations to Court.
 By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or
later advocating) a  pleading, written motion, or other paper, an
attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to  the best of the
person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable  under the circumstances,--
 (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to
harass or to cause unnecessary  delay or needless increase in the cost
of litigation;
 (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are
warranted by existing law or by a
 nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
existing law or the  establishment of new law;
 (3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary
support or, if specifically so  identified, are likely to have
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further
investigation or discovery; and
 (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence
or, if specifically so  identified, are reasonably based on a lack of
information or belief.
7   Rule 11 goes on to state
 (c) Sanctions.
 If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court
determines that subdivision (b)  has been violated, the court may,
subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate  sanction
upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision
(b) or are  responsible for the violation.
 (1) How Initiated.
 (A) By Motion. A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made
separately from other  motions or requests and shall describe the
specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It  shall be served
as provided in Rule 5 , but shall not be filed with or presented to the
court unless,  within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other
period as the court may prescribe), the  challenged paper, claim,
defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or
appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the party
prevailing on the motion  the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.  Absent exceptional
circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for
violations  committed by its partners, associates, and employees.
 (B) On Court's Initiative. On its own initiative, the court may enter
an order describing the  specific conduct that appears to violate
subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or  party to show
cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.
 (2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations. A sanction imposed for violation
of this rule shall be limited  to what is sufficient to deter repetition
of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly
 situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the
sanction may consist of, or
 include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty
into court, or, if imposed  on motion and warranted for effective
deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of  some or all of
the reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a direct
result of the  violation.
 (A) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party
for a violation of  subdivision (b)(2).
 (B) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative
unless the court issues its  order to show cause before a voluntary
dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against  the party
which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.
 (3) Order. When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the
conduct determined to  constitute a violation of this rule and explain
the basis for the sanction imposed.
8 The best way to insure that this malicious and intentional judicial
conduct does not occur again is
for this court to levy a substantial monetary penalty again the law firm
of Rodey, Dickason, Sloan , Akin
& Robb PA for violation of Rule 11 by the filing.  And, of course, for
continue harassment of plaintiffs by
this state issue continue to be heard by THIS COURT.

MOTION TO STRIKE ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO
FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING
1 ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO FACILITATE
ELECTRONIC FILING was written by defendant Robert St. John employed by
defendant Rodey,
Dickason, Sloan , Akin & Robb PA.  Exhibit A, page contains lawyer St.
John's signature.
St. John is a defendant in this lawsuit.  St. John has not filed ENTRY
OF APPEARANCE in this lawsuit.
St. John's filing ORDER is more than frivolous.  It is a malicious
intentional attempt to set the stage for
possible digital document alteration.
2   ORDER was signed by federal magistrate judge Don F Svet.
Svet is  defendant in New Mexico state lawsuit cv - 2000 10289 and
federal harassing lawsuit 00-1574
mv/wwd. New Mexico state lawsuit is still active jury trial matter.
Svet's signature is judicial misconduct because he is involved as
defendant in plaintiffs'  federal and state
3 ORDER is docket entry 10 filed 06/08/01.  Exhibit B.
Case is reassigned from judge Bruce Black to chief judge James A Parker
on June 7, 2001, docket entry 4
filed 06/07/01.  Exhibit B.
Svet was presumably removed along with Black on June 7, the day before
he signed ORDER  on June 8.
4 Magistrate judge Don F. Svet has established, along with some in
federal court's clerk office,
a pattern and practice of  court document fraud as seen in attach,
Exhibit C,
 MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF SUPPORT TO CORRECT DOCKET: (3) FRAUD  (WHETHER
HERETOFORE DENOMINATED INTRINSIC OR EXTRINSIC),  MISREPRESENTATION, OR
OTHER MISCONDUCT OF AN ADVERSE PARTY;
with electronic filings.  The gross and incompetent publication of two
digital file stamp documents with the
same digital file stamp but one dated December 06, 200 10:19 and the
other dated December 04, 2000
10:39 show that digital file stamping can and has been defeated.
Electronic filing in courts cannot work for the reason that digital
documents are too easy to fake, as seen
in Exhibit C.
5 The cases involving Morales and Payne are largely a result of the US
government misconduct
involving hardware and software "spiking" of computers.  Some references
on Internet are
The US government has the financial resources to fund such modification
of computer hardware and
software.  And has established an unfortunate track record of having
spiked computers and gotten caught.
6   WHEREFORE ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO
FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING must be stricken from the docket as an
improperly filed document
by two defendants.
In addition, electronic filing cannot be made to work because it is too
easy for an organization with
financial resources to fake.  The  US federal government has both the
financial resources and
demonstrated history of  'spiking' computer hardware and software.
7 Harassment is not a federal question.
New Mexico state court employees are no longer fooled by fraudulent
removal of the Morales and Payne
cases to federal court.
New Mexico second judicial chief judge W John Brennan along with clerk
Bennina Armijo-Sisneros have
forwarded harassment complaint to chief justice Patricio M. Serna to
appoint a judge to preside over a
state jury trial plaintiffs Morals and Payne have paid for.  And is
guaranteed under the constitution of the
State of  New Mexico.  Exhibit D.
The act of  Morales and Payne having to file this document is therefore
another act of harassment using
the US federal court system.
Discontinue harassment.
Remand to state court this and other two state lawsuits for harassment
and replevin and harassment and

      Subject: Michael Riconosciuto is in the hole!
      Michael Riconosciuto was pulled from his cell at 5AM this morning (Nov 6/01).  He was not able to grab his records.  He has been moved from Allenwood to a place he did not want to go.  He is in the hole at Springfield, MO.  Michael was revealing details of terrorist networks, now communications are severed and he has been taken to a place which is very dangerous for him.
                  Michael J. Riconosciuto
                  21309-086    Box 4000
                  U.S. Medical Center
                  Springfield, MO
                  65801-4000
      He is in the hole because he would be attacked by other prisoners if he were in the regular facilities.  They will need to move the main-threat person into the hole in order to get him time out of the hole - this won't do him a lot of good because other prisoners are also threats, and he could be beaten & killed.
      Michael was presented to the people at Springfield as someone who is mentally ill.  Fortunately, he got someone to call Allenwood to verify the cancer problem.
      His new BOP councilors are Mr. Dunn and Mrs. Cunningham.
      CAPT Newton E. Kendig II., M.D., Medical Director and Phillip S. Wise, Assistant Director are two men who can make a real difference. Please call them and let them know how important it is that Michael be given every opportunity to survive this ordeal. The Federal Bureau of Prisons Central Office is located at 320 First St., NW., Washington, D.C. 20534. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. Phone 202-307-3055. Fax 202-307-0826.
      Another potential source for assistance would be Congressman Petersen's office. Phone: 814-827-3985. Calls to local representatives would also help.
      I have spoken with Michael on the phone as recently as Sunday.  He told me he has all the information needed to totally expose the terrorist networks.  We needed time to unravel them.  Now communications with him are cut off.
      How long he can live in the hole when he is already ill, I don't know, but it is no way to treat a sick man, and no way to treat a person who is attempting to stop a disaster.

I read your article
Vazquez Oversteps Judicial Bounds
By HENRY MARK HOLZER
First Amendment Scholar
 Before a person or object can be unthrottled,
there must first be a throttling. And thatÂs what
happened in New Mexico last week, when U.S.
District Judge Martha Vazquez throffled the
First Amendment.
A provision of the Albuquerque City Charter
limits expenditures by mayoral candidates arid
punishes violation with fines, reprimand and
even removal from office.
 Candidate Rick Homans overspent. He sued,
claiming that the charter provision violated his
rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution. Homans relied on
the Supreme Courts
decision in Buckley v. Valeo that spending money for electoral purposes
was a form of speech
protected by the First Amendment.
 Although Buckley is quite clear on this point Â
and although some years ago, in a case of mine, a
colleague of Judge Vazquez had declared unconstitutional a New Mexico
statute providing that
funds raised for a federal election (i.e., Congress) could not be used
in a state election cam-
paign (New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v. Gonzales) Â Vazquez refused
to enjoin enforcement
of the Albuquerque expenditure cap.
 Even though a district judge like Vdaquez is
bound by higher-court precedent, and even
though it is the sworn constitutional duty of federal district judges to
apply those precedents, in
the Homans case Vazquez violated her oath.
 Buckley, decided in 1976, was decades old, she
rioted. One wonders how Vazquez would react to
he argument that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973,
rias lost its vitality after nearly three decades.
  Then, there were some non-binding statements
from lower courts, whose ideas apparently
impressed Vazquez. There is, she said, an Âabundance of judicial
commentary on compelling
governmental interests which fall outside the
ambit of BuckleyÂÂ Â on the basis of which she
found that the Albuquerque expenditure cap fostered such interests. How?
By preserving faith in
democracy and reducing the appearance of corruption. In other words;
because there is some
non-binding language in some lower court cases,
despite what the Supreme Court held in Buckley,
it was constitutionally permissible for Albuquerque to punish Homans for
spending more

should spend Â even if it was his own money Â
in aid of his mayoral aspirations.
 In addition, Vdaquez claimed that the Supreme
Court was currently divided over the scope of
Buckley. However, in making this claim she
failed to note the distinction that case made
between permissible restrictions on campaign
contributions and impermissible restrictions on
campaign expenditures, the latter being the only
aspect of the Albuquerque cap being challenged
by candidate Homans.
 Finally, Judge Vdaquez Â confusing her role in
our constitutional separation of powers system
with that of the elected and politically accountable Legislature Â

favors spending limits because they supposedly
improve the fairness of elections and ensure an
equal playing field regardless of oneÂs financial
resources, thus eliminating or at least reducing
reliance on Âspecial interests.Â
 Homans immediately appealed to the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. That court promptiy
reversed Vaquez, ruling, in essence, that she
had misread and failed to be bound by Buckley, and refuting every one of
the Âreasons" she had
offered in support of her refusal to enjoin
enforcement of the Albuquerque charter provision.
 The important point here, however, transcends
Vazquez's refusal to enjoin a patently unconstitutional law. It
transcends the Court of AppealsÂ
summary reversal of her lawless conduct.
 Why Judge Vazquez refused to enjoin enforcement of a patently
unconstitutional law is the
most important part of this story. She refused
because, like many judges, Vazquez apparently
believes that it is an appropriate function of
courts to make policy decisions rather than to
interpret and apply the Constitution and laws
that judges are sworn, to uphold.
 As a federal judge with lifetime tenure, Martha
Vazquez is not politically accountable. That lack
of accountability too often spawns a judicial
arrogance that can be checked in only two ways.
One, as we have just seen, is through reversal by
a higher court. The other is through the appointment process for federal
 Those who revere and understand the irreplaceable value of the First

appointed federal judges take seriously their
duty to Âpreserve, protect and defendÂ not only
the First Amendment, but the entire Constitution.

We sued Vazquez some time ago.  This lawsuit is active in both state and
federal courts.  But this is why we are suing again.
