@_subject: Ross's TCPA paper 
In general, I'm very fond of this sort of ownership analysis.  If I
have a TCPA box running my software, and thinking that its mine, how
do I know there isn't one more layer?  Leave it off, and my analysis
is simpler.
I suspect that verifying ownership of the TPM will be like verifying
ownership of property in modern Russia: There may be a title that
looks clean.  But what does the mafia think?  What about the security
services?  There may even be someone with a pre-Bolshevik title
floating around.  Or a forgery.  Hard to tell.  It's annoying to have
one's transaction costs pushed up that high.
I can get very high quality baseline software today.  What I need for
my cypherpunk wet dreams is ecash, and a nice anonymizing network.
What I also need is that the general purpose computing environment
stay free of control points, in Lessig sense.
