Fixed.  Also expanded, with more biographical/career/bias notes.
"Tanner recommends two ways lawyers can attain more 'mother wit.' First,
says, litigators would be wise to conduct as much of the discovery work
on their
own as  they can."

Thanks.  I've added that link and one to cryptome.  The latest working

The Judge in the case was a Carter appointee who
                        came out of retirement just to hear AlÂs case.
                        TannerÂs behavior in the trial created a court
                        that can only be described as Kafkaesque. There
is not
                        a single page that does not reflect judicial

How do we expect to even  find them, when they're using mixmasters to
remain anonymous? Do you know what a mixmaster is?   This is exactly the

Try not to puke on your keyboard when you read it.
Can a suspected pedophile claim that a virus downloaded the porn without
him knowing?
  Preposterous? But can a cop or a lawyer explain why the defense is
  The point is simply this: Fight fire with fire. In the past, police
have always had superiority. Better
  training, better knowledge, better guns. Not in cyberspace. While
pornographers are usually not the
  brightest intellects, illegal Internet activity is generally
perpetrated by those who know far more about
  the technology than everyone on the other end of the crime. Therefore,
it makes the most sense to
  solicit the help of those who know the technology: hackers.
Maybe they're busy DoS'ing Hamas/ROC/Deutsche Socialist music
and other thoughtcrime sites...
