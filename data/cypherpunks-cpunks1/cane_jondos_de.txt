You may have a look of "I2P Bote" it is severless, encrypted mail
system, address is the public key, P2P based... nice tool.
  It is part of the Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a P2P darknet.
The I2P router is router and client in one Java application. You have to
install he I2P router first: Afterwards you can add the "I2P Bote plugin", the serverless mail
system. SMTP- and POP3 support was on the ToDo list some times ago, I
didn't have a look on the latest version of the project.
Installation is not very easy, but possible.
Best regards
