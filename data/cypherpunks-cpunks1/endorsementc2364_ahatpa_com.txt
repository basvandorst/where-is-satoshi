What are your tips for clearing clutter so you can focus on such a project as sewing?" well mary, let me answer your question by showing you some examples of how i deal with clutter in different areas of my home:
interested? i think it would be so fun. we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. my sister and hair stylist, coco, is coming to utah county once again to meet our hair needs. 2. to keep the bedrooms clear i throw all the dirty laundry in the laundry room and shut the door. out of sight, out of mind! in a tiny town in idaho
i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
back in a few days
have a happy st. patrick's day. i am trying to be a patient, kind mom.
when you need to be home, may you find your way.
really really happy.
my happy little life
i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!
i am craving some sunshine.
we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. mostly i just stinking LOVE knitting.
