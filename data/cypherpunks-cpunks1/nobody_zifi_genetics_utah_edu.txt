Thursday August 8 1:14 PM EDT Terrorism Fears Prompt Support for Limits
LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - Most U.S. citizens are willing to give up some civil liberties in order to fight terrorism, according to a poll published Thursday. A nationwide survey conducted by the Los Angeles Times after the explosion of TWA Flight 800 and the bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park also
showed that Americans favored economic sanctions over military action against countries involved in terrorism. It found that 65 percent of those surveyed were somewhat or very concerned that the fight against terrorism could bring restrictions on civil liberties but 58 percent
said they would be willing to give up some liberties to help curb terrorism. Government and aviation officials have indicated that increased security measures at airports around the country could mean more thorough and time-consuming
inspections of luggage, questioning of travelers and higher fares. Of those polled, 66 percent said they strongly favoured more secure airports, even at such costs, while 17 percent said they ``somewhat favoured'' such measures. Asked what action, in addition to trying those individuals responsible, the United States should take if the TWA crash is linked to another country, 40 percent
favoured economic sanctions against that nation, 14 percent opted for military action, 10 percent thought both should be used and 8 percent thought no action
should be taken apart from a trial. The telephone survey of 1,572 adults was conducted from Aug. 3 through Aug. 6 and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

Further, my original question, phoned in anonymously to the FBI,
mailed in anonymously to this list, and asked to the media (I
guess I like wasting my time) has never been either asked or
answered. I will restate it in stronger terms:
"Why the hell, when you have a tape of the perp. saying something,
do you not air it in the middle of a city chock full of people
who could very well know this guy's voice/mannerisms?" Why didn't
the media ask for it, and then give the answer (the fibbieclerk
had no answer at all for me) the FBI gave?? Am I missing something?
We hear 911 tapes ALL THE TIME of various stuff happening. Has the
FBI suddenly become a bunch of civil liberties activists WRT the
privacy of terrorist bombers?
Just asking.

Betting on football is one thing, but some of us would be very
interested in the odds on US presidential election outcomes as
November approaches. This kind of betting is illegal here, and
I haven't looked lately for a "Ladbroke's" type site, but it is
interesting because the betting odds from across the Atlantic
more closely match eventual election results than the annoying
calls from Gallup & Roper during suppertime. I have posted here,
anonymously, on this topic before, but some of you are aware of
who I am. I'll thank you to keep that a secret. ;}

IMO, a good cypherpunk goal would be to get that "yet" in, with Chaum's
Digicash, before the election. Perhaps Mr. Cate has some ideas in this
regard...;) When talking to lawyers one finds the justification for the
prohibition to be something like, "it would demean the process." IMNSHO,
the nest has already been soiled, and the only effect would be to kill
the unwanted phonecalls around suppertime, as I said before. The media
would eventually flock to the more-accurate poll, even if it involved
the dreaded crass freemarket capitalism of people willingly gambling.
Indeed. Also, a prominent candidate (this time) told devotees (last time)
to give wrong answers to pollsters when called. While it's still possible,
this behavior is much less likely with real money (though with his kinda
dough, distortions would be possible for him -- & profitable for others).
Last time there was supposedly an arbitrage opportunity between odds in
Moscow and those in London [Now THAT'S my kind of bet;) -- I can't lose]
according to a W$J article on the subject from years ago. 20 minutes on
Alta Vista this morning reveals nothing like this available, Ladbroke's
links are hardly there, and I don't know the names of any other bookies
in London, or any at all in Moscow. The closest thing was a (braindead)
"George" magazine article and a few sites lamenting the lack of possible
Presidential gambling. AV didn't even reveal the confusing US university
site where some gambling is (or was) going on. Perhaps English c-punks
can help us on the odds for all candidates, including the longshots. I
think publicity from freeing up this information might be more favorable
than publicity about things like porn or Assasination Politics, and the
process of setting up a site that reveals the odds in semi-realtime from
London/Moscow should not be too difficult, especially if actual gambling
is not conducted on the site.

I find it interesting that you see Willam H. Geiger as a spokesman for
the cypherpunks list.  Remember, the list is open to anyone who can
operate majordomo except one.
The level of vitriol expressed by random e-mail users in the whole
world can hardly be said to be a "point" in anyone's favor.
Irrelevant, of course.  Some of the most terrible people in the world
have been pleasant.  D. Denning may or may not be the most terrible
person in the world, but her pleasantness is unrelated.
Personally, what I have found irritating about Denning is the fact
that she is widely considered to be a credible spokesperson.
Statements along the lines of "I can't tell you the scenarios we are
worried about because they are classified" are a little hard to take
seriously in a democracy.
Imagine if you or I tried to claim that we had to deploy strong crypto
but that for "reasons of cypherpunk security" the scenarios with which
we were concerned could not be revealed.  We would be laughed out of
the forum and properly so.
Denning is considered credible solely because her statements are
consistent with the interests and views of those in authority.
Denning has little to add to the cypherpunks list.  The core belief of
the cypherpunks is that their mail is their business.  People who do
not believe this are not cypherpunks and should not subscribe to the
list nor should they post to it.

@_subject: the VTW---FBI Connection 
We have received information that VTW is run and supported by the FBI,
which we have suspected for reasons listed here.
I) They appear to have no financial support or funding source. They
do not accept donations. They have no corporate funds. And yet they
appear to be a thriving business.
II) They are secretive about their location, and do not seem to have
a headquarters. The address listed in the NIC is a vacant lot in of
all places Brooklyn, NY. They do not have a listed telephone.
III) On a tip from a "friend" we learned that the power leader behind VTW
is a cleancut man with the unusual name "Shabbir M. Safdar." Not exactly
a common name. Several people say they've met him. Our "friend" says
that Mr. Safdar is in reality an agent of the FBI.
IIII) We didn't believe this without external verification. So we called
the Brooklyn office of the FBI and asked for Agent Safdar. No such person.
I called the Washington office. No such person. Checked if there is
any agent named Safdar. They don't give out this info. Then we tried to find
ANY public records on a Safdar, with no luck. No driver's license in NY, DC, NJ,
etc. No phone, etc. Odd that such a person does not exist and yet runs a
"human rights" organization? Then Alice called the NY FBI office. Asked for
Agent Safdar. Guess what? "He's not in. Can I take a message". No message,
thanks. He'll get the message all right.
Now the big question: What is the FBI trying to do getting all these
names? What else has "VTW" been doing? And what other organizations like
them are there? Who else is in on it? What does this say about EPIC, CDT, EFF?
Are Blaze and Schneier dupes, or willing participants? What about their
ISP? I think we are all owed an explanation. This is serious. Maybe FOIA or
a lawsuit before they burn the files.
What do you want to bet "VTW" quietly fades away after a few prefunctory
denials, and gets replaced by another organization in due course?

@_subject: Special Agent Safdar 
FBI Special Agent Safdar is upset enough by the revelation
of his true identity to issue a quick denial (on a sunday night, to get
more OT no doubt), but he doesn't even bother to try to refute the central truth that his cover has been blown by a careless operator at
his home office who verified his employment and offered to take a message
for him.
We don't have to wonder a second longer about the motives behind
Safdar\VTW\FBI's collection of names of crypto-dissidents, their
support of the Leahy crypto control bill, their refusal to
denounce it even today, their support of the digital telephone
act, the disinformation to make us believe otherwise and all
the other lies. And what about the money?
We must call on the other organizations, like EPIC, EFF, CDT, and ACLU
to denounce the VTW\FBI fraud. Their board of directories, Blaze and
Schneier to face the truth in public that they they have been used.
The net as a whole to demand its pound of cyberflesh.
There are very big questions to be answered now and we must not
forget to keep asking them until they have been. How high did
this operation go? Agent Safdar is no Olly North! He didn't
do this on his own. Who ordered this?
This is exactly like the FBI in the 1960s and civil rights groups.
In the hands of the right reporter, this could and should
bring slick willie right on down.

If someone tried a scheme involving violence such as A. P. through
a remailer I was involved in, the feds would not have to threaten me
with prosecution to get me to cooperate with them. I may not keep any
logs right now, Jim, but if your little scheme gets underway I will
cooperate willingly as long as I don't compromise the privacy of non-
violent people such as drug users & sellers. For them, I would go to
jail; for you, I would even cooperate with the BATF (which should be

No need to send to :Anonymous But since you did
I will say this:
No, government initiation of violence (such as in Waco, Ruby Ridge, etc.) is not OK,
and AsPol initiation of violence is not either. This can lead into a long argument about
just _when_ violence is initiated, where opinion is more important than fact, but IMO:
Randy Weaver was not initiating violence.
David Keresh was not initiating violence.
Pot growers and smokers are not initiating violence. But
Mr. Bell, if he follows through on his scheme, *will* be initiating violence. His scheme,
while it can sound tempting (especially every April 15th!) has no guarantee that it will
_only_ be used against the Lon Horiuchis of our government, in fact, it may be said it
is not guaranteed to not be used against Mr. Bell himself, as many have joked. There
are two roads to take in life, convincing and coercing others. I think that the former is
still possible, Mr. Bell and many others disagree. I worry that abuse of the very young
and weak (for now) anonymity system for the purpose of initiating, rather than exposing,
violence will lead to more government violence than we already have. Perhaps I am
wrong and there is no hope; but if so, that means another revolution. Revolutions are
very romantic sounding, to those who have not been in a war. I urge everyone to read
"Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men" by Jeffrey Rogers Hummel for a look at
what our last revolution got us (hint: it was *not* less government). I believe the book
is available from Laissez Faire books. It is quite good, and refreshingly truthful when
compared to the gobbledygook that most history teachers try to force down students'
 throats.
