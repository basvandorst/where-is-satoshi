 Hello!!!   =)
 "Thank you for requesting more information about the Cable Television  Descrambler.
 I've been asked so many good questions that I left unanswered in my
 first letter.  For that reason, I have put together this Question & Answer letter.  I apologize in advance for not being able to answer each of your   questions personally.  The response has been overwhelming. "
 Q: Will the descrambler on Fiber, TCI, Jarrod and satellite systems?  A: The answer is YES.  In respect to satellite, you just get MORE stuff!   Q: Do I need a converter box?  A: This plan works with or without a converter box.  Specific instructions  are included in my plans for each!  Q: Where can I find the 75pf-100pf variable capacitor, Radio Shack doesnï¿½t
 have it?    A: Many Radio Shacks do have it.  However, you have two other   options.  1st call a radio speciality supply store in your area that   is listed in the yellow pages.  2nd you can order the capacitor from me.  If needed I will mail you as many as you need for the price (s) below. Iï¿½m not trying to make a profit out of it, just want to help you. Iï¿½ll wrap it carefully and send it to you only if you send me a self addressed  size padded envelope,  with 64c postage affixed.	
1-10 	      75pf - 100pf variable capacitor      	$12.99 ea.		
20-Up 		ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½...............      $ 10 ea.
 Q: Can the cable company detect that I have the box?  A: No, the signal descrambles right at the box and does not move back   through the line.
 Q: Do I have to alter my existing cable system, television or VCR?  A: The answer is no.  Q: Does this work with my remote control?  A: The answer is no.

A: No, the plans come with an easy to follow picture guide.  Q: Does this work everywhere across the country?

A: Yes, if you are unhappy for any reason I will refund your money.  Q: Is this a rip off or a scam?  A: No, if it were Iï¿½d charge $50.00 or more for the plans.  Be sure I not   going to damn myself to hell by ripping you off for a measly $9.99 or   so.
