@_subject: Spanish Crypto Resources Web 
There is a new Spanish Crypto Resources Web page [it�s enterely
in Spanish] on the World Wide Web...
This page contains information about crypto in Spain, specially
links and info on spanish companies, magazines, associations,
events... and also some info on security, privacy, hackers &
crackers. Quite new right now, I hope it will be updated soon
with info and support from other spanish-speaking crypto-fans.
You will find some global links and references too.
Please, distribute this URL and info freely.
