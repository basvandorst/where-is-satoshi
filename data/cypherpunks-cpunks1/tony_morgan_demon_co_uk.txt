I'd like to chip in here, in my _very_ newbie way, that not everybody is running a unix system with the ability to pipe things between processes in so facile a manner. I access the net through a dial up from a MS-Dos machine running KA9Q software. My PGP is of the stand alone sort. I cannot easily get a new mailer to run on this system. Whatever protocol is decided upon, it would be useful if it were not too host-system specific.

Using the net, the 'banker' could easily be 'offshore' and not subject to US law in these matters. After all the internet reaches into Canada and obviously (from my point of view) to the UK.  I think a more real problem with anonymous banking, is not one of 'trust' in the 'banker' but in his net access. What do you do when your banker, for whatever reason, becomes unreachable?

I don't think that for any given length of random bit string, you'd be practically happy carrying around a suitable source. Thermal noise, which is what you get from a diode, is just as good a random source as radioactive decay.

What you say is true, but I still think that you need to have a substantive act,  before you can apply *legal* sanctions.  The way to prevent threats, is, as people have said in other posts, to prevent the reception of anonymous mail by those who do not want to receive it.  I freely admit that I *am* a free speech advocate.  I do not believe that you improve the condition of the world by preventing the speaking of undesirable words; Words should be countered by other words.  Many people plan to put the world to rights over a beer in a bar.  This may or may not include violent revolution. Are we to decree that this constitutes a violent criminal conspiracy?  Speech does not harm anybody.  People acting on other's speech is what does the harm.  *Free* speech is indeed useful. It's when widely disseminated speech is in the hands of the few that its power can be wielded against the citizen and then it is

While what you say is certainly true, it won't survive any kind of detailed attack. I'm all for the sentiment, but while there are so many mundane things going on round about, the best way to remain undetected is to remain undecipherable and to make sure that there is enough traffic about of the same sort. Press for encipherment of e-mail, that way, if everybody is doing it, who's to know what the underworld is doing? This is especially useful if you are not actually interested in violent revolution. You can then convince the powers that be that you are not worth

Well, the autorities trying to decrypt somebody's files would make an 'interesting' test for PGP. Although, they'd only have to crack the 'conventional' cypher to find your secret key.

It's people believing and acting on the words that actually causes the damage.  I believe that you must judge the reputation of the subject and issuer of any statement before you make up your mind to act on a statement.  It is only possible to widely disseminate a libel if you have control of the means of dissemination.  That, is not free speech. Where is the opportunity for contrary assertion by the person libelled?
Faking the explosion, was neither here or there.  Did they deny GM the right of denial. Could they be sued by the people that they misled?  I do believe in their right to say anything they like. They have a reputation to protect.  How much reputation has an anonymous source?  Are you going to believe an anonymous tip off until you have investigated it?  If so bigger fool you.

In the UK, We don't have a first amendment :-(
The law has developed in such a way that anybody with funds available can silence criticism by issuing a writ.  There is much more protection for public figures. for example Robert Maxwell, proprietor of Mirror Group Newspapers (& Pergammon Press amongst others) robbed his companies blind.  Everybody knew that he was a crook, but nobody could say so because he had the financial clout to silence everybody who said so with libel writs.  The UK needs anonymous posting far more than the US does.
