@_subject: Stop the presses -- Anti-terrorism bill not that bad 
Rather than resorting to such extreme measures as attacking the interior of the existing barrel with a file or nitric acid, simply replace the barrel with a new one (normally not prohibitively expensive), then put a few hundred rounds through the new barrel at the range so that it appears
used when/if examined.
Naturally this does not address the possibility of unique marks made on the primer by the firing pin, on the cartridge by the ejector, etc.

security.  When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to
society but for society to give to them, when the freedom
they wished for was freedom from responsibility, then Athens
ceased to be free."  - Edward Gibbon

@_subject: "Eternity service" paper request 
A couple of weeks ago Hal mentioned Ross Anderson's Eternity
Service paper (URL: As Hal described it at the time:
[. . . .]
At the time I thought this sounds quite interesting and filed the information away for a time when I would have an opportunity to
get the paper and read it.  I finally created that opportunity
recently only to find the paper at the above URL in a format I have
a *lot* of difficulty reading.  I'm a little embarrassed to ask such a
thing, but does anyone know a location where this paper resides in
plain-vanilla ASCII?
Many thanks.

@_subject: cypherpunks vs hacker 
(in response to Tim's suggestion that:)
Not to unduly belabor this, but I quite recently discovered another,
somewhat less widely known book on the subject.  _Approaching
Zero_ by Paul Mungo & Bryan Clough.  I've only skimmed it, but
my 11 year-old son has promised to lend it to me when he finishes
reading it.

Please do not assume that all earthlink users are alike.
I've just mailed instructions on how to unsubscribe to "Back Draft."
