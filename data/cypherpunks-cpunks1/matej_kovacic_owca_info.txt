@_subject: Data retention in Europe 
Since I live in Europe, just a short explanation of this.
Yes, it is about traffic data and not content. So Tor is a good solution
to this.
But there are some other problems as well.
In US there was a case Smith v. Maryland (Smith v. Maryland, 242 U.S.
735 (1979).), which diferentiates between content of communication and
traffic data. However, there is State v. Hunt decision (State v. Hunt,
91 N.J. 338, 450 A.2d 952 (1982).), which says individual can expect
privacy in traffic data also.
But European Court of Human Rights in 1984 (interesting date :-D) in
their Malone v. Great Britain decision clearly stated that traffic data
are integral part of communication.
There are some legal opinions that data retention won't go through so
called triple principle test. This test requires that regulation must be
a) legal (prescribed by law, law must be accesible to the public) b)
necessary in democratic society for the pursuit of a legitimate aim and
c) proportionate to the aim pursued.
It is also important to know, that European Court of Human Rights
critisized so called blanket measures in other decisions as well. So -
if there is no suspicion, individual should not be put under
surveillance. But data retention is that - surveillance and secret
tracking without prior suspicion.
The other interesting thing is that this directive was prepared and
adopted in very short time. How that?
It is likely that some strong lobby was behind direkctive. However, this
idea of extended surveilalnce is not new and is NOT the consequence of
antiterrorism measures. There are some documents from 1993 which show
that extension of surveillance and harmonisation of this area is not new
in Europe (see Interception of communications, report to COREPER,
ENFOPOL 40, 10090/93, Confidential, Brussels, 16.11.93, published on
Statewatch website in 1997). Terrorism is not the reason for this.
BTW: one of the latest proposals (I thik this version was also adopted)
said retention of data applies to ISP's only. No cybercaffes and public
places included.
The question is what are you doing in cybercaffe and wha in your home.
In cybercaffe you are surfing, posting on forums and checking your mail.
But you are not using P2P applications. P2P applications you are using
at your home.
So which lobby is behind directive?
Actually, there is only one lobby strong enough. This is the lobby of
anti-piracy groups and industry.
It is important to know, that first directive proposals stated that
retention is necessariy for fight against terrorism. But then they
started to talk about "serious criminal offences". What are they?
They are offences, which fall under European arrest warant. The warrant
applies in the following cases: a) where a final sentence of
imprisonment or a detention order has been imposed for a period of at
least four months or b) for offences punishable by imprisonment or a
detention order for a maximum period of at least one year.
Piracy and filesharing fall under European arrest warrant in some
european legislations. OK, it is true, that European arrest warrant is
in "crisis" since German constitutional court rejected it, but note
this: "no limitation to certain types of crimes for which access is
Slovenian Ministry of justice (I live in Slovenia) declared they support
data retention for all crimes which should be prosecuted officially.
So next step will be fighting this directive in constitutional courts
and finally on the ECHR.
Meantime we should propagate using Tor.

@_subject: Iran exit point 
access  are  hardly monitored and filtered, where clients have to show their
ID  to  enter an internet cafe and where all their data will be recorded, I
would like to understand how a TOR node can be run, unless it receives the
clearance of the administration!
I was living in former Socialistic Republic of Yugoslavia. We had a rule
that every user of a modem (for dial-up) should be registered by the
national telecom. The official reason was that there are some technical
issues which require registration. But it was a question of totalitarian
control, of course.
I have never registered and never had any problems - and the same was
with anybody I knew. I have heard similar stories with users using
strong encryption in France (which was prohibited).
So my explanation is that the control is probalby not so strict. And
sometimes it is possible to get a clearance routinely - officials
usually do not understand technical details and you just say something
that seems reasonably and get clearance.
But on the other side Iran could be sniffing Tor exit traffic to steal
some valuable information (industrial espionage for instance), or to
just annoy west governments (ok, less likely, but you never know).
However, I would say that internet communications in Iran are much more
monitored by the NSA than by Iranian government... :-))

sorry for just posting URL.
OneSwarm is a P2P file sharing service which uses anonimisation.
It is great because:
- it promotes anonimisation,
- it is open source and multi platform,
- it is user friendly,
- it is likely it will attract a lot of new users (promotion of
- is is faster than P2P over Tor, which means people will stop using Tor
for P2P (and Tor will be more useful for web browsing).

So it is possible to detect OpenVPN traffic with packet analysis. Some

First step was development of encryption techniques for the masses

@_subject: Encrypted mailing lists? 
I would like to share some of my thoughts about encrypting mesages on
mailing lists.
I think that it would be really great if Mailman (and other mailing list
applications) would support encryption. When user will register to
mailing list he or she should send his/her public GPG key to the Mailman
server. He/she would then receive public GPG key of mailing list.
All mail sent to the list should then be encrypted (recipient is mailing
list address and user has it's public GPG key). Mailing list would then
decrypt it, and deliver that message to it's users encrypted and signed.
That approach would resolve several problems:
- user would know that messages are really coming from mailing list (no
impersonation here);
- no spam anymore (or at least much less spam) - registered users would
need to send encrypted e-mails to mailing list, all other messages will
be dropped;
- messages are sent to user in encrypted form (regardless mail archive
is public or not) - prevents eavesdropping on public places for instance;
- messages stored in user's mailbox are encrypted (this could be
important in some countries (don't forget bordercrossing!). Even if
mailing list archive is public, this prevents automatic forensic tools
to get useful information from the seized disks;
- if mailing list is not public messages in an archive are really safe
(remember quintessenz and NSA mailing list archive story? :-> );
- if mailing list is public messages in archive are still signed and
their itegrity could be checked;
- this would promote encryption in several ways: users would be "forced"
to use encryption and users would get familiar with encryption;
- and this is also important: more e-mail traffic would be encrypted by
default - that makes all us who use encryption more safe. Remember: NSA
thinks that everybody using encryption should automatically become a
target od broader surveillance - let's overload them).
I believe we should ask Mailman developers to include that functionality
in the future releases.
What do you think?

@_subject: Encrypted mailing lists? 
just a remark to a notice from someone, that the problem is trusting the
mailing list software - that it is properly encrypting/decrypting
messages, etc.
Yes, this is a problem of endpoint security, but the same problem we
have right now.
Encryption of e-mail in mailing lists would mostly:
- assure transport security from/to particular user only (remember -
mailing list passwords are send to users unencrypted!)
- promote use of encryption technology
This are by my opinion the most important goals of this idea.
BTW, if someone does not want to use encryption (because he or she has a
lot of emails), there should always be an option (for public mailing
lists) to decide whether he or she want to receive plaintext only,
encrypted or signed mesages. (The point is in choice. :-) )

this might be of interest to you:
Peer-to-peer VPN
The VPN part of this project implements a Layer 2 (Ethernet) network
between the peers (VPN nodes). The peers connect to a central server
which acts as a chat server for them to establish direct connections
between each other (data connections). These connections are used for
transferring network data (Ethernet frames), and can be secured with a
multitude of mechanisms. Notable features are:
    * UDP and TCP transport
    * Converges very quickly after a new peer joins
    * IGMP snooping to deliver multicasts efficiently (e.g. for IPTV)
    * Double SSL: if SSL is enabled, not only do peers connect to the
server with SSL, but they use an additional layer of SSL when exchanging
messages through the server
    * Features related to the NAT problem:
         1. Can work with multiple layers of NAT (needs configuration)
         2. Local peers inside a NAT can communicate directly
         3. Relaying as a fallback (needs configuration)
