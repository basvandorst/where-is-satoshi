@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor virus 
The standard TBB does not work because Ethiopia is currently fingerprinting and
dropping both, the TLS client and server hello. More details are available here:
However, there are slightly modified bridges which can circumvent this block and
make Tor usable from within Ethiopia. (You'll get such a bridge by writing to
"help at rt.torproject.org".)
