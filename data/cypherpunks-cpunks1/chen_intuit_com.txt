@_subject: Government vs. Markets 
It would be helpful if we could define the word "government."  Is a
government any organization of people, or is it any organization
wherein some people hold coercive power over others?  In either case,
how are corporations different from governments?  If it is argued that
corporations are different because, as an employee of a corporation, I
am free to terminate my employment contract and to enter a contract
with a different corporation, then it can also be argued that, as a
citizen of the U.S., I am free to terminate my citizenship and assume
citizenship in another country.
In large measure, privatization really amounts to nothing more than
removing programs from the incompetent, technocratic control of state
bureaucracies and submitting them to the incompetent, totalitarian
control of business.  There is no question but that our government
works very poorly by any standard; I just don't see the argument for
privatization as being an argument between statism and anarchism
(Bakunin would agree :}).  It is, rather, merely an argument between
two different, equally decrepit organizational precepts.

I wasn't sure whether to respond to this message, or your other one,
which admonished that this is off-topic.
And within the scope of their operations - among their employees -
corporations have a monopoly on the means of economic coercion
(forgive me if I omit your editorial use of the word "legitimate").
They have exclusive control over livelihoods.
So maquiladora workers are "persuaded" to work twelve hours a day for
fifteen cents an hour.  Salvadoran workers are "persuaded" (at
gunpoint) to contribute to the welfare of their latifundista
benefactors for either a handful of beans or nothing at all.
Similarly, I am "persuaded" to contribute my labor to the designs of
my employer - truly, because if I don't like it, I can leave.
Perhaps your will elaborate your assertion.

Blanc is right.
You are correct, Jim, in that in terms of destruction, the wars you
mention surpass in magnitude the other events that I listed (though
I'll point out that if we count Indochinese dead, Vietnam's cost was
far higher than 55,000, even if we add in the more than 60,000 who
committed suicide in the aftermath).  What I am really saying is that
we are not, even in "normal" times, the slightly rambunctious but
contented citizenry that popular mythology makes us out to be.  This
country has serious problems, and it always has.  I think that we may
be in agreement on this.
Another good point that you've made elsewhere is the importance of
economics as a motivator.  I believe that you are exactly right.
I'd like to add more, and also to say something about the perceptive
comments from John Young, but I think I have a flu, so I'll go home

Yes, it's often easy to identify a single piece of the overall dynamic
and use it to account for everything that happens.  I'm only saying
that legal guarantees are not necessarily the last word about what the
government can and can't do to you.  Chomsky's optimism (as you know)
doesn't stem so much from a faith that our legal system will one day
start working properly, as from a faith that people are capable of
evolving - an outlook that you and I seem to share, but that many on

@_subject: Tedious Chomsky arguments, some small remailer relevance. 
In response to James Donald:
The Hayek quote is correct, and an example of what Reinholdt Niebuhr
called "manufacturing consent" (where have I heard this?).
I am not going to get into your Chomsky argument, except to say that
your excerpt explicitly contradicts your conclusions:
For which you graciously provide a vigorous, trenchant "analysis":
There is no mention anywhere of moral superiority.  There is a
statement of the demonstrable fact that "the editors and the
ambassador, in the not very distant past, have supported racist murder
on a scale that exceeds Amin's wildest fantasies," referring, perhaps,
to the (then) recent Indonesian slaughter in East Timor, or to the
secret genocide in Cambodia (the one that happened *before* Pol Pot),
or to any number of other U.S.-_Times_-backed atrocities.
This is simply nowhere to be found.  "The general failure to be
appalled by their hypocritical pronouncements" clearly has nothing
whatever to do with Idi Amin.  I know that it's difficult for you to
conceive, James, but life is not always a football game.  Hating the
Rams doesn't imply loving the Packers.
This is the same as your  and again, it is neither said nor
I would suggest that you read the passage again, but I don't think it
will help.  You're evidently quite intent on tilting at Chomsky as
some sort of symbol of all that is threatening to your special brand
of proto-Malthusian machismo.  And it's really an extraordinary
conceit to suppose that anyone else cares.
You say elsewhere:
Before doing the service of "pointing out" all of these grandiose
things to us, perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension.
Your original claim was:
The "analysis" which you present, apart from being factually wrong in
every imaginable way, does not move one inch toward supporting this.
If the only purpose of your claim was to serve as a platform for
launching vapid diatribes, then knock yourself out.  Otherwise, we
would all appreciate it if you'd stick to the point.
This is the last I will say on the subject, unless the thread assumes
the shape of something vaguely relevant.

A minor adjustment to your comment: I haven't read the work yet, but
if it's based on Shor and Simon, it only "proves" the existence of

relating to the construction of unitary transforms) - a fact equally
congenial to Many Worlds, Copenhagen, von Neumann, and most other

As the person who evaluated Courier for Intuit, I feel compelled to
point out that Intuit does *not* endorse SSL.
I agree with all of Perry's criticisms, and offer a couple of my own:
1) since SSL is a sub-application-level protocol trying to solve an
application-level security problem, it leaves communicating nodes
vulnerable to early-termination attacks.  SSL MACs authenticate
individual SSL records, not application messages.
2) since only fools run http servers on secure network segments,
network admins are faced with the problem of clearing sensitive data
(presumably "protected" on the line by SSL) out of the DMZ in real
time.  This is a pain.
Fortunately, Courier suffers from neither of these infirmities.

For those who missed it, the problem is that the encryptor in an

forge another message for which the signature is also valid (after

@_subject: One Time Pad encryption over the Internet, securely? (fwd) 
Unfortunately, I am bound by an NDA.
However, I am not violating the NDA by saying that Craig is correct.
There is no way to do a one-time pad except by doing a one-time pad.
In other words, it is not possible to generate synchronized, truly
random key streams at remote locations non-algorithmically.
One-time pads have a property that no other encryption scheme has.  If
I am an attacker and I somehow gain access to all of the key material
and all of the plaintext that two communicating parties have so far
used, I am still unable to decipher the next transmission.  *Only*
one-time pads have this property, and there is no way to achieve it
without negotiating a key stream out of band.
OTPs also have some other properties that are more mathematical in
nature.  For instance, the probability of getting any particular bit
of plaintext from a given ciphertext is equal to the raw probability
of getting that plaintext by itself.  In other words:
   p_P(x_i | c) = p_P(x_i)
where P is the plaintext space, x_i is the plaintext, and c is the
   p_K(K) = 1/|K|
which means that all keys are used with equal probability,
irrespective of plaintext and ciphertext.
Hope this helps!

One interesting aspect of Anderson's result is that it decisively
breaks X.509 (he shows how to forge signatures in
encrypt-before-signing protocols by computing a discrete log over the
RSA modulus).  I strongly recommend the paper.

I hate to say it, but in the case of Quicken, this is exactly right.
In version 5.0, we've taken measures to protect the online financial
stuff, but there's no serious protection at all on the local data
file.  It's truly a deplorable state of affairs.

This is a good idea.  I'll bring it up with the appropriate people.
Right now, we only have some cheesy forums going on Compuserve and
Prodigy; however, keep your eyes peeled.  We have other stuff in the
