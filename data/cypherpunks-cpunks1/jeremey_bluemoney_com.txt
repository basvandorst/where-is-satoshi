@_subject: Getting ecash without an MTB account 
Should work just dandy, with this note: You must destroy your wallet
on disk for the transactions account and recreate after every
"transfer" is complete. This is because the sequence numbers on mint messages will not match and the MTB client will complain about it and reject the messages. However, you can re-create your wallet with
no problems at all. (Note to Digicash developers, if you're reading, please allow any
sequence number greater than or equal to the expected value in future
wallets. There is a really obscure and damned difficult attack that
can be mounted against this, but the alternative is a non-portable
wallet. Not being able to have an arbitrary number of wallets for the same account is mucho annoying).
BTW, there are better solutions to operating without a mint account,
but they are not widely available yet.

@_subject: Profanity, PCS phones, and FCC 
Well I went and got a PCS phone (Ericsson), and was pilfering through the manual, and came across this amusing text in the "Operating procedures"
section of the "Guidelines for Safe and Efficient Use":
  Portable PCS telephones are subject to the rules and regulations
  of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Following
  these rules will help eliminate confusion, ensure the most efficient
  use of the existing frequencies, and result in a functioning
  radio network. The following offenses are punishable by fine,
  imprisonment, or both:
   o Use of profane, indecent, or obscene language while using your
     phone.
   [a bunch more snipped but somewhat more sane regulations]
Joy. More laws to break.

@_subject: Anonymous browsing (was Re: Getting Back to our Radical Roots) 
Anonymous web browsing is definitely being worked on. However, simply chaining proxies ala remailer chains is not sufficient because traffic analysis is fairly trivial.
The question is what's the threat model. If the goal is to prevent the
server from identifying the client given limited resources, then  or similar is sufficient. However, the real problem
is preventing an entity with unlimited resources and control over most
of the nodes in the anonymous network from conducting successful traffic
analysis. This is an entirely different and very difficult problem.
The cpunks are getting some help in this from the Naval Research Lab
(although actually I think we're helping them not vice versa)
because the military seems to want to be able to browse anonymously too.

The API as it stands is done, and tested fairly well on linux and bsdi.
Over the next week or two I have more to add though, and have to do some
porting, notably to windoze. But that's roughly the ETA. I think I'm gonna
set up some sort of mailing list for it, I'll post details.
BTW, I think the API header made it's way to this list a couple weeks ago,
but if people want to know what to expect, lemme know.

@_subject: Anonymous browsing (was Re: Getting Back to our Radical Roots) 
You'll have a secure black box then. Everything in the black box
is secure, but the real information comes from watching what goes
in one side and out the other. Unless there is an astronomical amount of traffic, it will be fairly obvious who's doing what.
After all, knowing who did what is the goal of traffic analysis, usually not what route they took in between.
The trick is to design a system where an eavesdropper can't correlate
a connection into the anonymous network to one coming out. Such a system will almost certainly involve some sort of "personal proxy" running on your own machine. It might maintain a constant bandwidth to the anonymous network, but that's sub-optimal since most people like their bandwidth for other things.

@_subject: ecash & remailers 
Coins are removed from the cash db when they are paid out. They are then
stored in the payments db along with the payment headers, etc. The blinding
factors are not stored once the coins have been paid. Regardless, removing
the payments db will not cause any ill effect (that I have noticed, except for
the obvious loss of payment records), so you can do that anyway if you like.
(Note, this is based on a hex dump of the payments db, so it's possible I'm wrong. Anyone from Digicash who knows otherwise, please correct me.)

Agreed, SET is overengineered hogwash.

Perhaps... OTOH, SET is SO bad that it will be impossible to deploy,
probably forcing everyone away from it anyway.
As far as a better protocol, it's already designed, implemented, and
running quite nicely in our software. :-)

I don't doubt that... but when they get zero orders because _noone_
has a SET wallet much less SET certs for their cards, that decision
will get re-evaluated pretty quickly (I would think). If the consumer has to get out of their chair to use SET, it's dead. And they have to do considerably more than that IMO.
The infrastructure required for SET to actually be used is outrageous,
especially for the consumer. All IMHO of course.

A program, called Fortify, has been developed that hacks
Netscape to provide strong encryptioni.e. 168bit 3DES or
128bit RC4).
Available on most platforms and for both versions 3.0
and 4.0 of Netscape. Freely available on the site
below and only some 500K.
We have tested it on one of our pc's
...and it worked.
-> DES-CBC3-SHA connections with my own testserver have been made
-> Netscape: "high-grade encryption key for U.S. domestic use only"
