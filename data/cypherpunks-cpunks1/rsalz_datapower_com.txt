Looks like hardware S/Key, doesn't it?
If I could fool the user into entering a quizcode, then it seems like I could get the device and the admin database out of sync and lock the user out of the system.

{I'm not on DBS so they won't see this.}
I wasn't discussing the politics, just the architecture.  But anyway: if Liberty does manage to field something run by the CCard companies, then it will survive, and probably win.  MSFT will have to acceede to what Visa and MC deploy.

So for the well-meaning naif, a literature search should result in "no
news is good news."  Put more plainly, if you looked up hash and didn't
find news of a SHA break, then you should know to use SHA.  That assumes
you've heard of SHA in the first place.
Perhaps a few "best practices" papers are in order.  They might help
the secure (distributed) computing field a great deal.

You must not have looked very hard. :)
I would start by taking Apache, openssl, and the mod_ssl package.
For example, at
    we see the question "How can I authenticate clients based on
certificates when I know all my clients?" and it's answer.
Similar questions are also answered.

If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend Don Davis's "compliance defects" paper (and slides!) available at   Abstract follows:
  Public-key cryptography has low infrastructural overhead because
  public-key users bear a substantial but hidden administrative burden.
   A public-key security system trusts its users
  to validate each others' public keys rigorously and to manage
  their own private keys securely. Both tasks are hard to do well,
  but public-key security systems lack a centralized infrastructure
  for enforcing users' discipline.  A "compliance defect" in a
  cryptosystem is such a rule of operation that is both difficult
  to follow and unenforceable.  This paper presents five compliance
  defects that are inherent in public-key cryptography; these
  defects make public-key cryptography more suitable for server-to-server
  security than for desktop applications.

That's a deployment issue, not a technical issue.  D-H key exchange, for
example, would be just fine.  It just so happens that the SSL creators had
a particular business goal in mind:  e-commerce, with a "certificate"
re-assuring the nervous customer that they were handing their credit card
to jcrew.com, not, jscrew.com.  Yes, SSL was invented to solve a
particular problem.  They did a reasonable job at it.

But if the system is rooted, then the attacker merely has to find the

Unless Windows is planning on getting real kernel-level kinds of protection.

Phil Hallam-Baker made of Verisign made a similar proposal.  (I missed
responding to an earlier post on this thread that said "here comes
Verisign" or such-like.)  Unfortunately, I can't find his post any more;
I think it was on one of the XML security WG lists, but the message has
already been purged from my mailbox.  On thing interesting about the VRSN
proposal was they they had a hardware implementation of the "velocity
checker" as an option.  And a patent applied for that.

Totally agree.  At this point in time, if it's a TCP based protocol
and it isn't built on SSL/TLS, it should pretty much be treated
as snake oil, I'd say.  Perhaps some kind of evangelism is needed.
