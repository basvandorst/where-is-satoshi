Namecoin is another currency, based from bitcoin code. But like many
crypto things, when you take a "black box" and little modify it, the
conseguences could be a complete disaster.
Namecoin is flawed and *NOBODY* should consider it anymore. From [1]:
0. Coins are destroyed
1. NetworkFee descreasing for 50 to zero and will be zero in ~80000
block and has no feedback with network activity like difficulty has.
2. Namecoin was designed for free domains and this is its future
3. Developers have to do system intrusion from time to time to avoid
collapse or spam hell
DIANNA try to use existing bitcoin chain's (as satoshi explained) to do
the same thing, but they are designing it carefully. Help them if you
can. [1] liberationtech mailing list

In 2007 Ingmar Baumgart and Sebastian Mies have released a paper
where they try to fix this (and two other) issues [1].

Are we trying to reinvent anonymous remailers and nym servers?

@_subject: [cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
In these months there was a lot of talking about "metadata", which SMTP
exposes regardless of encryption or authentication. In the design of
this p2p system, should metadata's problem kept in consideration or not?
IMHO exposing danimoth or my  it's the same, as there is
a function between them. I2P and/or Tor adds complexity to avoid such
mapping to any non-state-level adversary.

@_subject: [cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
A problem which could rise is the 'incentive' for peers to continuosly
providing bandwidth and disk space to store messages. I'm a simple dude,
with a mailflow of ~5 email per day. Why I should work for you, with
your ~10000 mail per day for all your mailing list?
Somewhere on this list (or p2p-hackers?) there was a post of mine,
regardings an economic incentive between peers, which could be a
solution, but as always technical problems arose, like pricing the
services and a fair exchange between peers.
