Especially so since, in the absence of law enforcement interference, a
limited online supply can serve a huge body of viewers. This makes the
problem impossible to solve on the demand side. The rational response would
be to go back to plain old police work for those few producers that actually
harm kids, treat the cases without explicit regard for the sexual nature of
the deeds (if there is physical violence, that's punishable quite without
specialized KP statutes), and let the images stay online to satisfy what
demand there is. In fact it might not be a bad idea to saturate the market
by putting the stuff in the public domain and allocating some of the
considerable law enforcement anti-KP budgets to run the servers. At least
the financial incentive to produce more KP would come down considerably.

Which is one of the very reasons people hesitate to break contracts. It's
just more advantageous the concentrate on mutual cooperation. Plus,
anonymity even rids the parties of a possibility of confrontation, be it in
court or on the street.
That's just the point. Anonymity might well create a new carrot leading
people to deceive. End-game performance and all that.
Yet one is left with more traditional means of redress, e.g. exposing the
other party to the public or the law enforcement, and the internal
bookkeeping mechanisms of the shadier markets themselves.
However, if the former group is large enough, as one suspects, it may well
repress any attempt to accommodate the needs of the latter. For instance,
legislative attacks on any widespread anonymity infrastructure are pretty
much a given when people, most of whom have precisely the kind of idealistic
conception of the legal system you describe, realize that law can't touch an
anonymous economy.

@_subject: Escrow agents 
Escrow is practically useless unless Esther can verify that both parties
have kept to their promise. If the data Esther keeps is encrypted, this will
not, barring ZKPs, be possible. In an anonymous economy, having the data in
a usable form will give Esther an incentive to use up the tradeable goods
escrowed by Bob. Anonymity also gives her a real possibility to do that,
unlike with traditional escrow. Of course there are a host of nasty
complications, like how different sorts of tradeable items might be
protected from this sort of conduct (e.g. anonymous cash probably could be
protected from Esther, while sensitive corporate memos being sold to a
competitor perhaps couldn't), and the possibility of linking Esther to the
damage done to Bob in different kinds of transactions. Nevertheless, I think
this is a valid objection.
Bonds are a different thing, though. Offhand, the only problem I have with
them is the protocols one would use to ensure that the bond is never
collected unfairly. If the information passed is such that its value cannot
be ascertained without human intervention, one would need an arbitrator,
perhaps even one with the resources and knowledge of the contracting parties
(I'm thinking sale of information whose value depends on factors not known
to the public). But on the other hand, this might well be a circumstance
rare enough to warrant little attention.

Agreed, to a degree. But it isn't very difficult to outlaw crypto, and to
effectively control its use for online anonymity - to get a workable
anonymity infrastructure, you need common protocols, participants to create
the mixnets and a certain amount of publicity to make your effort matter. It
is extremely difficult to run such a usable setup without being detected by
a determined TLA. Unlike with IP, porn, prostitution and drug trade, control
of online activities can largely be automated.

Yes, broadcasts and mixnets have different tolerance to different kinds of
attacks, with benefits of synergy. But saying they're unassailable simply
because they work fine, now, is short-sighted.
AFAICS, it's likely a matter of priorities -- currently anonymity does not
pose a significant threat to governments. If that changes, the heat will
intensify, possibly to a point where means currently unimaginable could be
employed (e.g. national firewalls, regulation of nonconduct, creative
interpretation of laws on criminal collaboration, RICO, whathaveyou).
Besides, what happens in the US currently has a lot of weight in the global
Internet. Causing a netsplit between the US and the rest of the world is
enough to severely harm most online services out there. Criminalization of
online conduct in the US may be all it takes to make an anonymous online
economy too cumbersome to hack.
For remailers, mandatory filtering at the ISP level? For broadcasts, you
track all the receivers and correlate to arrive at likely suspects.
If they can pass CALEA, they probably could force internet exchanges to
filter remailer traffic, given favorable public opinion. All you need is a
view of anonymity proponents as anti-state anarchists intent on protecting
known dangerous criminals (thus, collaboration), and a couple of high
profile trials where remailers successfully protect the identity of
terrorists or child molesters. The fuss about Osama bin Laden and
encryption/stego might well be the first step in such a campaign.
As for foreign remailers, a number of governments might be pliable enough to
overlook US originated DoS attacks on them after having been convinced that
anonymity is a real threat not only to the US, but to each and every nation
Now, the above is of course fiction, for now at least. But keeping such
widescale attacks on the infrastructure part of the threat model is not,
IMHO, a bad idea. The discussions on stego, disposable remailers, physical
broadcast technology and the like are part of that, and serve to lay the
groundwork in case shit one day does hit the fan.

Essentially they are thinking about putting FINEID into SIMs alongside the

government, or more accurately, Vdestvrekisterikeskus (Population Register

version of our national ID card which is used to enable dsigging
transactions with governmental and municipal authorities. If I'm not
entirely mistaken, Finnish law has already been amended to make dsigs
binding in the eyes of the law, so basically you can use the card for any
transaction. The infrastructure is not widely deployed, yet, and few people
have FINEID enabled ID cards.
About Eugene's fears, one already needs a national ID card here, since it is
needed to "prove" your identity whenever you have dealings with governmental
authorities, or try to withdraw money from a bank, or whathaveyou. (In fact
this is one of the fun countries where the police has the authority to
detain you until such time they can verify your identity, for no reason
whatsoever.) Since everybody has one such document already, and the vast
majority also has a cell phone, the extension to FINEID on SIM ought to be
relatively painless. I suspect there will be little outrage over the matter,
That personal information is very limited in the current incarnations of
FINEID. The application is basically a government certified binding between
a running identifier (called SATU) assigned by person, and the person's
first and last names. It is pretty strange that even as we do have a unique
ID ("henkilvtunnus") in use for the populus, that is not included on-card.
SATU does constitute another such number, if it's ever assigned to a
significant majority of Finnish people, but there seems to be no way for an
ordinary reader of an ID card to tie SATU to the national ID. VRK of course
has the means, since they assign both numbers, and the info likely leaks...
Now, it is quite probable that they'll include a digitized photograph and
maybe fingerprints if FINEID is ever used to sub for a passport. That is
something even I'm pretty concerned about. The same goes doublefold for any
attempt to make the FINEID app invokable remotely, when the SIM is attached
to a phone.
Which, of course, are basically the same thing. I believe the application
already exists. It'll likely be put out in a year or two, likely without a
significant counter-reaction over here.
The interesting part for most people on this list is that if the application
ever gathers support on the phone manufacturer side, it might well be that

Mostly agreed, though I still tend to think that there is a gray area where
we might argue about the Framers' intent. Regardless of that, broad
interpretation of the First is a positive thing.
Sure, but what I meant is that instead of limiting the concept of obscenity
to truly repulsive kinds of pornography, the Supreme Court has effectively
sidestepped the issue. Obscenity is not a very well defined concept, and
anti-porn crusaders are betting on stretching it to cover ordinary
Not really. Most of the anti-porn crusaders base their rhetoric on some
vague idea of harm caused by the material. With most religions, you cannot
easily draw the conclusion that they are harmful to the community. And where
some people think you can, as is the case with Satanism and the lot, one can
see that the public opinion already (mistakenly) sides with regulating them.
I dunno. Constitutions are meant to legislate the state where the rest of
the law legislates the state's subjects. It seems just appropriate that
anti-government people would concentrate on constitutional issues.
Naturally, but why not embrace and extend? The fact is, one of the reasons a
good part of the CDA was struck down in the SC is the existence of
self-labelling technology. The next time around, it'll probably still be a
good idea to have true, voluntary self-labellers around, if not else, then
to show off that "self-labelling works".
Yes, I've gone through the archives on that, and plenty of other sources as
well. Still, most of the critique is about why self-labelling will never be
perfect. It does not render the idea completely useless -- I think of labels
as metadata, some of which can be useful even if not perfect for any given
use, filtering or finding hardcore S&M.
As for misrating, that's a problem of reputation. If you can solve it in an
anonymous economy, you can certainly solve it in a non-anonymous rating

True. Yet harm gives you cause for Common Law action, no?
That's also precisely what I meant, even if I expressed it a bit
That is precisely why I said labelling is a "nice gesture". The Code must
not concern itself with labelling, but you *can* do it, some people want
labelled content, and there are political advantages in both rating your
content and having truly voluntary raters around. Why not be one of them,
then? If you don't want to, it's always a valid reason. I just think there
are valid gains in rating, and so e.g. to a degree rate my own site.
Quite. My argument was about what is "nice", no more.
How? Maybe we should limit discussion to this as it's more cypherpunkish
than rating/labelling per se.
It's a question of where you draw the line between coerced and uncoerced. If
many enough of your peers think it's good behavior to label your
communications, and failure to do so leads to an amount of badwill, does
that constitute coercion? If not, we have a voluntary system where social
pressures encourage you to rate, but where the gain is not a direct economic
advantage, but rather the avoidance of the badwill of others. One might
argue that such "bad behavior" should be tolerated, and that rating is no
longer properly "voluntary" if rating only means you avoid an extra-legal
social sanction. Nevertheless, there is a definite incentive for a
non-anonymous person to rate correctly (to maintain his reputation),
sometimes an incentive to misrate regardless (like when you're advocating a
politically incorrect opinion), and the extra possibilities afforded by
anonymity in these situations (using a disposable tentacle to communicate
and/or misrate). This way, anonymity does make a difference even in an
uncoerced situation.
Agreed. If the topic of rating once again surfaces, for whatever reason, we
can always pick it up then. For now it does seem interest is minimal.

Agreed. As Tim said, one first needs to show that there is a rights
violation, and that harm is indeed being done. In fact I'm of the opinion
that even when that *can* be achieved, it's still not quite ok to regulate
if the harm is not immediate -- even if violent entertainment does cause
violence, and people are dying because of it, you need to show that the
subjects are not left a choice, but are compelled to act violently. Probably
you'd need to show that they've been forced/tricked into watching the stuff
in the first place. None of that can be done in the case of "entertainment
unsuitable for young eyes", of course.
The reason I started talking about harm is that *if* we could satisfy the
above conditions, we would have a case for regulation, even if basic rights
are thereby infringed.
Those who campaign for voluntary labelling without a covert agenda (who Tim
argues represent a negligible minority of rating advocates) naturally hope
that those who *are* your clients will be requiring the ratings, and so
providing the incentive to rate. In essence, they hope that the presence of
voluntary ratings will become the norm, and as essential to the reputation
of an online entity as its credit rating, or the accuracy of its past
communications. They are daydreaming, of course, but I do not see where the
basic fault in this reasoning is.
The trouble is, rating schemes can be turned into certification schemes,
where the label represents an assurance that the information is kosher. In
this case, you *do* rate for the customer. The same would happen with
current rating schemes if they were to become widespread enough; one can
imagine MAPS like blacklists, non-cooperation of ISPs and so on, where
people who are not your direct customers still react to unrated content as a
part of a collective effort to control some (imaginary) externality.
Nobody wants this to happen, of course, and it hardly will, given the effort
it would take to "rate the Internet". The point is, there is nothing wrong
with the economics per se.

However, methods used for watermarking et cetera are not optimized for
strict non-detection. What I mean is, they are of course meant to be
difficult to predict down to the sample level (since that would make them
easy to remove), but the presence of this sort of stego is often quite
easily verified. Especially if the algorithms are well known. This is
unacceptable in a non-watermark stego apps.

If stego is meant to be used between individuals, it's unlikely that a
watermark would be present in the content naturally - after all, the marks
are meant for CRM applications and individuals rarely take such good care
of their private communications. And as for watermarks on commercial
content, anyone caring about the presence of hidden communications can
obtain a licence so that the watermarks can be completely detected. If the
eavestropper is capable of full detection (not just statistical guesses),
commercial watermarks fail to provide a meaningful hidden channel. (I.e.
one would expect databases of valid marks to be available to an adversary
of means.)
In fact, many of the meaningful adversaries can perform a removal attack on
commercial watermarks, since the licences are available to corporations and
governments and, in the absence of workable asymmetric watermarks,
detection equals capability to remove. This means that one cannot
necessarily even use an existing watermark to hide another carrying your
I think covert communication has very different needs from CRM. E.g.
requiring non-detectability means that you have to model the channel
statistics very closely, leading to a low bandwidth covert channel. CRM
does not suffer from this, since a watermark only needs to be perceptually

Of course. The point was that using a watermarking system as-is makes the

other data.

@_subject: watermarking sucks (Re: stego for the censored II) 
Not really. If the original version is not available, a properly constructed
watermark will basically amount to a noise component. Comparing two noisy
versions of the same data will not give you enough statistics to recover the
noise completely. Averaging attacks (averaging over multiple independently
marked copies to try and fade out the mark; an optimal attack if the marks
are independent and flatly distributed) can be seen as a channel
distortion, which isn't too difficult to compensate for, with sufficient
redundancy in the mark. A good watermarking scheme resists averaging over
ten or twenty independently marked copies. Beyond this, it becomes quite
difficult to find paying customers ready to participate in collusion on a
regular basis. Anyway, this is what CRM people are counting on.

It would be fairly interesting to hear what those health risks are. If they
refer to risks to the people doing the experiments, I can't see any beyond
what normal parenting would bring. If they instead refer to the babies being
born/built, then we're seeing one serious extension of the concept of
"unborn babies". The GE scare has religious morality, ignorance and fear of
the unknown written all over it.
Makes one wonder whether babies are Food or Drug. Just as one has a hard
time telling which one religious sects are, Alcohol, Tobacco or Firearms.
But see, once they've done with cloning, they'll crave for more. Soon
they'll be doing gene splicing and whatnot. Then we'll have a swarm of newly
born \bermenschen running around, wreaking havoc. The final days are coming,
there will be Judgment...
Actually I think the law prohibits research targeted at cloning in addition
to cloning itself. All the same, it's bad law.
The hysteria surrounding gene manipulation is weird all over. I've never
even seen proper assessments of threats beyond the problems created by large
monocultures of genetically engineered plant species, the effects on third
world economies of patented crops and allergic reactions to unexpected
foreign proteines in foodstuffs. This is hardly the sort of stuff to cause
one to reach for the gun, and could be dealt with on the market. The only
real threat I can see in cloning humans is the risk of fucking the baby up
for good, and somehow it is quite difficult to see a) how that would happen
if you're just doing a competent clone job and b) how one justifies
preemption of the research since the mistakes have yet to be made.
"Resurrect"? That is one serious piece of loaded lingo -- the next thing
they'll be doing now is slipping in spiritual advice.
It seems that they're making scientists into the bad guys. Science flunkouts
indeed, having a fit of envy. They really should understand that in a free
country, researchers have no reason to explicitly hide their operations, or
to sneak around cloning babies. "Are you, or have you ever been, a

That I didn't know. I've been under the impression that most failed cloning
attempts result in a miscarriage. But, it really doesn't affect my point --
if we think that starting a pregnancy known to end in unhealthy babies gives
the government a reason to intervene and incarcerate, then we also have to
apply the same standard to those who smoke/use dope/live unhealthily during
normal pregnancy. That is what I meant by the "unborn babies", the view that
we should think of foetuses as first hand citizens with constitutional
protection that is being violated when they're "made unhealthy".
Yep. That's even worse.
That I can relate to. The point was less about whether cloning is ethical
than about the right of the government to stop it.

This is of course just a part of a general tendency, the broadening of law
to cover risk (e.g. mandatory seatbelts), indirect harm (e.g. the idea of
currency transaction taxation to "stabilize" exchange rates), thought crime
(e.g. hacking, copyright violation and the diaries-as-child-porn stuff),
harm through inaction (e.g. not helping a suffocating person) and
"injustice" (e.g. nondiscrimation statutes; my own views are in flux over
this one). I.e., people increasingly consider law in terms of consequences,
not actions. I can't see how this is a surprise to anyone on the list.
And also the fact that people increasingly view such licencing as part of
the government's legitimate sphere of influence, or even its responsibility.
Somewhere along the line ordinary people seem to have lost the idea that by
default everything is allowed, and have come to think that before one can do
something, the state can, and so has to, guarantee that there are no
unfortunate consequences (e.g. FDA requirements on new pharmaceuticals).
Hence, regulation based on possibilities instead of outcomes.
One might extend that to people with at least some familiarity with
libertarian theory.

through patents on basic bioresearch tools. It isn't legislation, but the
centralization sure makes state control a helluva lot easier, plus gives

We'll have to wait for that until the critters do something useful, or the
general public believes that is an imminent "threat".
Mm. I've always thought of this sort of thing as more of a spinoff of the
conventional censorship discourse.
Might be there is a difference, though, as Plain Old Censorship is usually
advocated because the material itself is "harmful", while we now operate on
the added spin of "stuff that enables you to do Bad Things". That's
obviously a bit broader in that it covers just about all functional
science/technology, even if the stuff per se does not incite the reader to
*do* anything.
The patent argument above ties nicely with this one.
I think the Rael crackdown is more a display of common irrationality than
the kind of deviousness you attribute to it. "But we need to do *something*
about it!"
Or, if you are right about the precursor knowledge bit, a fresh attack on
crypto infrastructure. This time it would probably start by associating
crypto with pedophiles -- lately national security seems to have lost its

All in all, constitutions should have adequate protections against black

Yep, the US does lock a whole lot of people up. But what about the constant
whining about "overflowing prisons", then. Or the many instants where

real estate? That sort of thing isn't about a decision to invest a lot into
incarceration, but precisely the kind of thing that one day makes everyone a
There would be ways to control this too. One way is to make it possible for
inmates to sue for damage due to overcrowding and the violence it causes.
This would make for a superlinear increase in cost, and eventual balancing
in the density of inmates.
*Of course* parole isn't the initial cause, but it's one of the few enabling
factors which allow excess criminalization of harmless conduct to be at
least partially quenched. The usual reasons for legislative bloat stop us
from pruning the code directly, but a strong strawman can be made for not
letting people out of the slammer before their term is up.
That's really just the age old question of whether two people suffering half
as much each constitutes the same amount of total suffering. From the
standpoint of individual freedom, one might argue that more people are now
hurting. You would probably say the maximum harm/injustice done is now less.
I still think that in the first case the probability of a given person being
unjustly imprisoned is doubled, and this is bad.
As you already put it, given a chance, neither. But the real point is that
transponders shouldn't be an option *and* the cost of putting people away
should be high enough to become prohibitive for anything but the most
serious of crimes. If this was to come to pass, the question would instead
become "would you rather be free with your rights intact than wear a tag?".

I agree that that too has a part in it, and that mandatory sentencing is a
genuinely braindead idea. However, it has a lot more to do with who gets to
walk than with somebody having to be let out in the first place. The primary
reason is that the society simply isn't willing to invest enough in prisons
to carry the load, contrary to what you originally claimed.
That's just the point -- you can't. The political machine simply does not
work that way, which is seen by the proportion of new laws passed to old
ones stricken. The reasons are well known (one common way to lump the
reasons is to call them "political suicide"), and are pretty difficult to
get around without resorting to the kind of ass-backwards trickery we've
been describing.
Than anywhere else in the world. Especially note that, even if it clearly
doesn't lead to the most effective disincentive on crime, Europeans' fairly
humane attitudes towards prison inmates largely serve the purpose Tim and I
are after with the cost talk. The mechanism isn't nearly as important as the
underlying necessity of imposing a real cost on governments' harmful
activities. That is the only way that really works; goodwill simply does not
get things done.
Not true. The same argument you use, i.e. that habitual restrictions on
freedom can be traded for at least /some/ freedom, can be used to argue that
you can always sacrifice your freedom in order to stay out of jail in the
first place. Just obey the law, however senseless it might be. It's

I think the relative cost of parole vs. completing the sentence is the

There should be paroles, but their cost should somehow be forced to the same
level as serving the time behind bars. After that the only reason to let
someone out would be the balance between the prospect of rehabilitation vs.
risk taken.

The only logical conclusion I can see to skirmishes between black-clad

The issue is escalation, and we know entirely well that there's been a lot
of that in the last twenty or thirty years. We already have riot control

probably motivated by tough-on-crime attitudes.
The police are already given broad discretion in their use of force. (For

brought us dedicated riot control forces could very well grant the police a
catch-all licence to kill when "threatened" by a group of protestors. The
Bloc attire and their interest in direct action constitute a highly
plausible threat. So could any larger crowd of angry people who refuse to
disband, if people ever start to think of protestors merely as "anarchists"

Not all of us. In fact, if you look at the statistics, e.g. we Finnish
people are actually quite *well* armed. Just not with handguns, but hunting
rifles. If something like that were to happen here, there would be no
shortage of firepower. However, over here the fact that they are torching
your property isn't an excuse to shoot -- if you manage to kill one, it's
murder, and probably not even in mitigating circumstances. The same applies
doublefold to defending yourself against police brutality and co. People
usually don't think about using firearms to defend themselves, even if they
happen to own some. They know they'll get nailed for it, no matter how
righteous the shooting might seem to be.
Dunno... Seeing what went down in Gothenburg, and the shit that's going on
now in Genoa, I too am beginning to think there is something very wrong with
all this...

I wonder whether this is a problem brought on by the ideas of students, or
by the students expressing their ideas within the confines of the public
school system. See next.
This would be no problem if the school was private -- fear is good enough a
excuse for expulsion if it is made explicit, beforehand, that explicit
writing is not accepted. But when the student is forced to participate in
the education, punishing for something that hasn't already transpired is
certainly unjust. It clearly limits the breadth of thought the student is
allowed. If one is frightened enough to think of poems written by teenagers
as evidence of imminent violence, one should definitely have the option of
enrolling one's children in a school where provocativeness is forbidden,
stupid if that sort of move would be. But when people have no realistic
choice of how to school their children, it is to be expected that the full
spectrum of human literary talent will be present, too. The result is that
some writings will certaily touch on controversial issues. Like the poem at
issue here. The only problem here is that *all* children are being pressured
to participate in education in an environment (public schools) where
opinions and modes of expression that the more close-minded may perceive as
threatening necessarily manifest.
(BTW, the poem was pretty evocative, as far as I can tell.)

This is a point I raised on a watermarking list a while back -- most of the
stego work today is aimed at watermarking/content protection applications,
since that's where the money is. Those applications do not have the sort of
strict demands on deniability that stego used for secret communication has.
Instead of statistical transparency, they aim at perceptual. Instead of
strict deniability, they go for robust detection and difficult removal,
which imply easily caught redundancy in the output. Hence, most of the
steganographic algorithms out there are completely unsuitable for
cypherpunkly use, even when information theory posits steganography squarely
as the kind of race-in-statistics you describe.

Not necessarily, if the beam is focused on the target but its intensity is
lower at the source. If I'm not mistaken, the 747 stuff does precisely this,
even incorporating adaptive optics to combat atmospheric distortion. But on
the whole you're probably still probably -- this does sound more like
starwars than efficient anti-missile technology.
But I also think the question Choate posed is a valid one: what happens when
the target is *not* a ballistic missile, but people, equipment and vehicles
on the ground, normal aircraft, or air-to-air missiles? One would think that
the lower velocity differentials and expected distance-to-target make aiming
much easier, and that effective counter-measures would be significantly more
difficult to erect, considering that such conventional targets have
properties very different from those of ballistic missiles (e.g. aircraft
raise questions of aerodynamics and payload efficiency, wearable materials
with albedos high enough are difficult to come up with, rotation and
aerodynamic engineering cannot be used to dissipate the heat generated by a
hit, people/cars/tanks/whathaveyou often need to be difficult to spot using
aerial and satellite imaging, and so on).
Such weapons capability could be *quite* useful, especially if the 747 can
be effectively defended against anti-aircraft missiles, and the laser has a
range and targeting capability on par with anti-ballistic missile
applications. Hits on critical infrastructure, control over a nation's
airspace, death-from-above FUD, that sort of thing.

No. The electromagnetic field, as described by Maxwell's equations, is a

Perhaps. On the other hand, it is clear that people attach connotations to
expression based on their experience of where that expression is used. Think
of Carmina Burana after it was used in the Omen, or the associations carried
by heavy metal. E.g. both sorts of music can be used in a movie as a
leitmotif to satanistic themes. Similarly a Goth attire and a suitable
amount of group aggression will likely be as efficient on a child with a
Christian fundamental worldview as a direct threat. And as time goes by,
such connotations may well subsume the original meaning. A good example of
this is what being a skinhead is today and was in the sixties.
If the community at large embraces religious intolerance, Christian chant
may well be the ultimate threat to a young Wicca. If it has a significant

The term "asymmetric information" refers to a specific situation where you

If this applies throughout the whole economy (i.e. the natives can't
compete with any product at all), you'll have a trade deficit and sooner
or later the currency rate will go down. That'll end the imports and even
out the difference in efficiency.
In the absence of a currency area boundary, you'll still have Ricardo and
his principle of relative benefit (that the term?). Nobody'll starve
because of competition, unless they're just plain lazy and/or unable to
adapt. Sweatshop work is a variation of the latter.
If the previous buyers get their food cheaper somewhere else, what's the
problem? That production can survive within the confines of an inefficient
economy is no reason to keep running that inefficient economy. Otherwise
you'd be transfering income from the buyer to the seller, and
inefficiently at that.

A bare one objection to comprehensive market based security: a market
needs private property, and other civil rights, in order to function
efficiently, as predicted. Protection is what guarantees those rights. If
you place protection on the market, you no longer have a guarantee that
the market itself can function as originally intended.
Cf. piracy (in its original form) -- an evolutionary system like pure
market economy (anarcho-capitalism) will likely settle in a state with
parasitic activity present. It is not clear that this stable state (you
would call it a Schelling point) would not include a major proportion of
rights violating commerce (like mafia protection rackets and the like).
Hence it is not clear that it indeed guarantees maximum economic
efficiency; it might be just a local maximum.
The above, of course, has very little to do with Tim's analysis of private
security of the airline industry. But it does have a lot of relevance to
placing *all* of the normal police activity in the private sector. If I'm

So, is there some sort of guarantee that the transfer of control won't be
stopped by a check against cryptographic signature within the executable
itself, in the future? That sort of thing would be trivial to enforce via
licencing terms, after all, and would allow for the introduction of a
strictly limited set of operating systems to which control would be
transferred. I'm having a lot of trouble seeing the benefit in TCPA
without such extra measures, given that open source software would likely
evolve which circumvented any protection offered by the more open ended
architecture you now describe. Such a development would simply mean that
Peter's concern would be transferred a level up, without losing its
relevance. I'd also contend that this extra level of diversion is
precisely what TCPA, with its purported policy of "no trusted keys" aims
Again, such values would be RE'd and reported by any sane open source OS
to the circuitry, giving access to whatever data there is. If this is
prevented, one can bootstrap an absolutely secure platform where whatever
the content provider says is the Law, including a one where every piece of
runnable OS software actually enforces the kind of control over
permissible signatures Peter is so worried about. Where's the guarantee
that this won't happen, one day?
At the hardware level, yes. At the software one, it probably won't be,
even in the presence of the above considerations. After you install your
next Windows version, you will be tightly locked in with whatever M$
throws at you in their DLL's, and as I pointed out, there's absolutely no
guarantee Linux et al. might well be shut out by extra features, in the
future. In the end what we get is an architecture, which may not embody
Peter's concerns right now, but which is built from the ground up to bring
them into being, later.
More generally, as long as we have computers which allow data to be
addressed as code and vice versa, the ability to control use of data will
necessarily entail ability to control use of code. So, either we will get
systems where circumventing copyright controls is trivial or ones where
you cannot compile your own code. All the rest is just meaningless syntax.
In that light I bet you can guess why people are worried about TCPA and
its ilk.

No. It is the case with the digitized version, but not the work. Nobody
would argue that actual copies aren't normal, private goods. One time,
when copying was difficult, there was even a one-to-few correspondence
between works and copies. Today that isn't the case. Replication and
creation are now neatly separable, and benefits of scale in the former do
not translate to returns to the latter. Copies are still a private good,
as ever, but works are becoming increasingly pure public goods. According
to orthodox public goods theory, that might well be a problem.
In practice the issue is muddled beyond belief, of course.
Did this thread really start with something taken from LMD? The list
really *has* stooped to an all-time low...
The point in copyright wars is about incentives to authors vs. the right
to copy privately, not about the ease of copying. Sure, microtransactions
are a possibility. But when the yield does not go to the one who created
the master copy, why should anyone create anything, anymore? (Or, more

Quite. Coase's reasoning demonstrated that any initial allocation of
property rights is equivalent (both in the allocative and distributive
senses) when transaction costs amount to nil. So, if we look at the
distribution side of the information industry, you're absolutely right.
The smaller the transaction costs the better -- rivalry applies to any
particular copy, as it does to services involved disseminating the bits.
Any trades required are bilateral, competition does its job and everything
is just dandy.
But if we look at the creation end, that's a different story entirely.
Anyone eventually receiving a copy will benefit roughly equally from the
efforts of the artist/author. If copying and distribution are exceedingly
cheap, as we'd expect them to be in the future, the number of people for
whom acquiring the information would be profitable easily grows to the
tens or hundreds of millions. Since any copy released will be widely
disseminated, the deal between the original author and the public with an
interest in his work will be multilateral in the extreme. It cannot be
reduced into a bunch of bilateral trades as in the case of private
commerce. This means that we get sizable transaction costs. IP is there to
force the economy into something approximating the conventional, material
one, and so internalize externality otherwise generated. (No, it does not
solve the problem. But limited term copyright could still strike a
near-optimal bargain.)
If something, Coase's original point is behind copyright, not its

Then you really must be blind. Markets not based on private property or

It does indeed. But unlike movies, Linux is a modular project. The kernel
would exist in the absence of the GNU toolset, and vice versa. X would
exist in the absence of UNIX, too. Each of the common desktop applications
could very well have been coded on top of something else than Linux.
But try constructing an Independence Day without Will Smith. Or the
special effects. Or the soundtrack. Or the distribution chain. Try
guaranteeing that it arrives on schedule without making a loss. I think
you will not be able to accomplish that with a volunteer effort. Try doing
that tens of thousands of times a year (that's for all of what is
currently covered by IP) and you're bound to fail. Unlike with Linux, the
individual parts of most larger projects involving IP are of no use
without the surrounding whole. Unlike Linux, many IP products aren't
modular, reusable or decomposable, and so they can only exist if you can
find a single source of financing for the whole project. In the case of
modular projects, you can rely on overlapping interests to fill in the
voids, but most projects aren't like that. Especially if all that the
creator gets is the ever-diminishing value of a single copy.
Why is it that there's no Buzz for Linux? No decent installer? (Not one of
them survives my hardware...) No workable Unicode support? A stable 64-bit
filesystem? Why is nobody willing to guarantee kernel stability, even when
paid big bucks? 'Cause the project is a gift, and only caters to a single
kind of need: something an individual developer/company really needs and
can afford to develop for him/itself, then losing little by exposing the
code to others. Usefulness thinly spread over a considerable user
community is completely forgotten.
Well, what stupid people they are. I wouldn't go anywhere as far as
gettimg myself killed for the common good. Even paying for software I can
just copy is a stretch. What makes you think most people care enough to Do
the Right Thing? What makes you think relying on Doing the Right Thing is
a good idea? I mean, it's been tried before, and the consequences aren't
worth a second look.
Indeed they are. So are ones assuming that anything not profitable to a
single person couldn't be to a larger number of individuals. Like most
things, private property rights and economic theory based solely on
bilateral trade are a matter of continuous dispute. It's not that I don't
consider them useful (I do; nowadays you could call me, too, a
libertarian), but taking them as granted isn't the way to go, either.

Even if you neglect market failures in the usual sense, an outcome such as
everybody becoming a slave to a single individual is Pareto efficient --
you can't dissolve the situation without hurting the slave owner. Pareto
efficiency talks about allocation, not distribution, and so the latter can
be arbitrarily skewed in a Pareto efficient economy. Even to the point of
apparent absurdity. It's a different thing altogether, then, whether you
can approach such a dismal state of affairs via Pareto moves...
I don't think so. Instead I'd say that is Marshall efficiency in the
absence of transaction costs. The trouble is, you can never make everybody
happier by redistributing since someone will have to pay the cost. (Here
we of course assume that everybody wants more of everything.)
More to the point, there is a redistribution which would allow the total
amount voluntarily paid by a large number of people exceed the amount a
minority is ready to pay to avert the cost of the redistribution.
(Nowadays I'm thinking this isn't bad in itself, but that amplification of
this sort of pattern via returns to scale is.)
Quite. But on the other hand, public goods reasoning is also a very, very
dangerous thing. Consumption side externalities are my personal favorite.
Suppose there is a considerable personal benefit to rich people in seeing
the average bum spend his money in something respectable instead of
liquor. In this case, liquor consumption has a visible externality, and
optimal provision calls for institutions which more or less tax the rich
and use the proceeds to encourage the bum to straighten up. Now, that
doesn't sound *too* bad in itself, but when you apply the same reasoning
to the educational needs of the young and the societal benefits one would
expect of a highly educated younger generation...

Of course not. Am I not making this precise point?
However, that sort of property isn't anywhere near the kind one would
expect of a free market commodity -- it isn't severable. You can't legally
sell or buy votes.
What can I say, barter in time and effort is probably the best sign of a
gift economy in action.
Of course they can. However, not one of those parts is useful in itself.
You don't sell a set without the actors, or vice versa. That's the
problem. With Linux, each individual utility is useful in itself. If
someone needs the functionality, one just codes it and releases. In many
cases that's a few days work, and a good part of the benefit goes to the
coder himself. Consider then something like a novel. It's not very useful
if you tear out the last 50 or so pages, is it? Whoever is making and
paying for the effort (perhaps with his time, as is the case with
volunteer projects) has to be willing to invest enough to finish the work
before it acquires real value. That value is then thinly spread over a
considerable number of readers many of whom have to be willing to pay for
the effort if the novel is to come to being in the first place. When I
talk about modularity, I talk about it in the economic sense of
divisibility, not the technical one of being able to create a single act
of a play, a movie set, a Java class or an actor's performance in
isolation. The trouble with public goods comes around when no single
person is willing to pay for the whole project, but a million or so in
toto would be, barring transaction costs from things like freeriding. If
you grok it, I can't help you.
Hollywood blockbusters? Hardly. That was what I was talking about from the
start. Besides, I do know a couple of Finnish low budget directors. Only
rarely do I find the tenacity to actually delve into their work. Money
isn't everything in movies, either, but it's still a lot.
First, there is nothing wrong with being a "stupid user". Stupid users are
who software is mostly for, aren't they. Second, it's not the whole
install, it's details like getting X to work with a nonstandard display
memory config. I'm not exactly unknowledgeable about software, but I'm no
kernel hacker either. Do you think most people should be?
Throw in the fact that this precise relativity is what the whole of
economics revolves around, and the table turns quite nicely.
Did I somehow limit the question to money? If so, that's certainly not all
that I meant. The economics of public goods apply perfectly well to
nonfinancial compensation.
In fact, copyrights do not have anything to do with money, per se, only
with the establishment of a property right in abstract things. If people
behave the way you seem to think they do, we will slide into a
nonfinancial information economy even in the presence of copyright; Coase
was brought into this, and it's still relevant. If you start from the
normal assumptions relating to laissez-faire economics, you'll also assume
transaction costs to be negligible and a stable, unique equilibrium to
exist, in which case any initial allocation of property rights will lead
to the precise same outcome.
Actually I'm not advocating a whole lot, here. Right now I'm mostly making
a point about public goods and Coase's theorem, and their connection to
the institution of intellectual property rights. As I said, I'm an IP
abolitionist and free-marketeer myself.
But if you read what I've posted so far a bit more carefully, you'll see
that that is not at all what I've assumed.
Not true. A simple example would be people shunning someone in opposition
of their (mostly) shared moral code. This is a typical example of
publicness (everyone has to gain by still interacting with the shunned
individual) and some of its civil counter-forces (morality) in action.
Examples of trade which are necessarily multilateral are everywhere if
you're just willing to look. The interesting part is how to cheaply get
around the extra costs incurred by the setting. You're not helping a whole
lot in that department.
True. But the issue only gets interesting when you can explain why, and
also why the market does (or doesn't do) better.
(I'm also thinking it's high time for me to shut up.)

Believe me, they're all known to me and properly appreciated.
But that's precisely my point. If you want to serve an interest which is
widely spread, with little willingness to pay on behalf of each of a
couple of million beneficiaries, you will have a public goods problem. One
way to arrive at such a problem is to demand everything of a single
system. But at the same time there are a number of monolithic problems
which achieve the same by themselves. That's what I was talking about.
Of course. We might argue that has to do with the dependency of a gift
economy on income effects feedback which gives a good deal of nice
outcomes when people are nevertheless getting richer. Somewhat pointedly
the question becomes, could Open Source keep up the rise in income by
itself? Is it a productive part of the entire economy or a parasite on
existing forms of welfare creation?
Again, my point in a nutshell. When a problem is grave enough to warrant
an investment on behalf of a single developer, that single developer
*will* develop the software and, at the very least in the absence of
copyrights, face a very low price on open sourcing the code. But there's
still the kind of software which gives some tens of millions of people a
per capita benefit of, say, $1 a year while requiring a clear, centralized
development effort with considerable cost. Cryptix hardly lies in that
category, even while extremely useful to a number of people.
Aye. PKI is a tarpit. You get into it, but only rarely do you find someone
who cashed out on it. In this case it isn't the market that fails,
Nobody's putting open source down, here. Far from it. My point was an
economic one, having little to do with those forms of software development
which obviously work. It wasn't even meant to advocate a particular
approach to financing the production of goods infected by the problem.
Instead it was a simple reminder of the limitations of the commonly
accepted image of free market, purely bilateral trade attaining efficiency
in a general sense, without any regard for transaction cost analysis.

@_subject: millicent ghettoes 
In the wake of the recent public goods postings and some related traffic
on a couple of Finnish mailing lists, the concept of transaction costs has
somehow managed to dominate my time. That sort of thing has a lot of
unlikely consequences, some of which I think are highly CP relevant.
While I tend to agree with Tim about the shorter term trouble with
micropayments -- the fact that such payments, well, do not pay -- I'd say
in the longer term micropayments are what counts, and not perhaps
anonymity. The reason is, most of the economy is, and I think will remain,
over-ground. People really don't have enough to hide to make anonymous
payments mainstream quickly enough. Sure, they have their applications,
some of them radical. It's true they will shake the society quite a bit.
But the shadier applications can always be controlled, given the
vulnerability of the anonymity infrastructure itself.
But micropayments, they are another deal entirely. If and when they become
practical, we can envision a whole range of previous unheard-of mass
transactions taking place. The kind which need millions plus people before
they actually become profitable. This is the situation I alluded to in the
public goods example, and any market oriented solution to the problem of
coordination will eventually have to tackle the issue of aggregating the
cost. That's the problem micropayments, as an idea, are meant to solve.
So, what's so notable about such transactions? Simply the fact that they
are new. In the past entire classes of transactions (the foremost example
would be the ones we nowadays see in the international financial markets)
have been enabled by lowered transaction costs. I don't think the spread
of micropayments will be an exception to the rule. In fact I would argue
that the only *lasting* surprise offered by AP was the fact that when mild
wants of large numbers of people can be coordinated, economic efficiency
can lead to significant, and heretofore unexpected, outcomes (i.e. getting
a notable figure killed).
In the end I think such new classes of financial transactions, borne of
lowered transaction costs, will be far more significant to the society as
a whole than anonymity. I also think this is the essence of what is
driving the wider P2P cirlce, at the moment, though few people seem to
realize it. So, I would deem it quite likely that the millicent ghetto
will eventually run over us.

@_subject: Piracy is wrong 
On the contrary. Piracy, when defined your way, is a basic right. If
someone has information and can copy it, it is in no way the author's
concern. It would be if the author subsequently didn't have the work
available, but that clearly isn't the case. Since information can be
copied without in any way diminishing what the author has, piracy isn't
theft. Copyrights, instead, severely limit what individuals can do with
the information, equipment and other property they have.
Copyright is an artificial limitation on people's rights, upheld on
utilitarian grounds. It's a practice of granting a monopoly on some
information by fiat to correct a market that is supposedly broken. It
certainly isn't a property right, and the law doesn't pretend it ever was.
Instead what copyrights are is a monopoly on certain kind of
information/speech, backed by coercive power. Copyright is a compromise,
and the reasoning behind its current form of is quickly becoming obsolete.
Under the circumstances, it's no great surprise that there are such things
as copyright wars.
Well, then we shouldn't support them. DRM does not stop copying. If it
did, we wouldn't have a DMCA hanging over our heads.
Sure. But one part of a functioning legal system should be that conditions
which cannot efficiently be enforced should not be. From my viewpoint,
conditions put on by an author are tantamount in idiocy to the Firstborn
Clause, and have nothing to do with what can be enforced.
Au contraire. Unless your conditions are fully compatible with the right
of individuals to do whatever they want with their CD-ROMs, T1s and P4s,
they should not be respected.
Intellectual and physical property are two institutions which cannot be
meshed. You can have one or the other, but if you try both, you will end
up with all sorts of nasty contradictions, or a severe bunch of
limitations and easements to one of the institutions. Also, anything you'd
ever want to do with IP short of building a second M$ can be achieved
utilizing what protection we have for physical property. The only
difference is, you will have to carry the costs. That's what's proper, not
bringing the Men with Guns to people's doorsteps to harrass them about
something they downloaded that's on the Internet anyways.
Then why do they?
Indeed, and I thank the artist.
But how's that a gift, then?
No. I can very well acknowledge beforehand that I will take all gifts
offered to me but will never respect any strings attached. After this, the
artist can decide for himself whether he wants to offer the gift.
Well, this would be if there was a contract between me and the artist in
which I agreed to abide by the rules set out by the author. But there
isn't. I haven't promised anything, will not promise anything, and
certainly will not conceed any kind of IP law to be a personal promise by
No. I am picking up what the artist voluntarily left on the street to be
picked up.
Indeed. My basic ethics says freedom of speech is absolute and covers any
act which involves solely the movement or expression of information.
Copying fits in nicely. In fact, I might argue there is an ethical
imperative to copy, as it doesn't take anything from the author, but
certainly gives a lot to those who don't already have a copy.
Come now. I'm getting my supply elsewhere, namely hot-mp3-warez.org. They
give me much better terms. Call that competition.
You also don't do something you like and claim that others have agreed to
pay for it when in actuality they haven't. That would be fraud. Even when
that something is of use to others.
Anyway, this discussion got old before it even started. We could debate
ethics till the cows come home but what really matters, here, is who wins
the wars in the end. Is it studios backed up by law or individuals backed
up by hoardes of P2P programmers and DRM hackers? I'd put my bet on the
latter -- nations may be powerful enough to kill millions, but they
certainly aren't powerful enough to make a billion or so people respect

@_subject: Real-world steganography 
I'm not sure about HDCD as a technology, but the principle is sound. If we
can compress sound transparently, we can also transparently embed quite a
lot of data into the part which is perceptually irrelevant. We might also
depart with perceptual equivalence and go with perceptual similarity
instead -- e.g. multiband compress the audio, and embed data which allows
us to expand to a higher perceptual resolution. Whatever the
implementation, putting data in the gap between statistical (i.e.
computed against a Markov model) and perceptual (against a perceptual
similarity model) entropy which compensates for some of the perceptual
shortcomings (like total dynamic range) of a particular recording
technology seems like an excellent idea.
However, applications like these have very little to do with steganography
proper. In this case, we can (and want) to fill up the entire gap between
statistical and perceptual entropy estimates with useful data, leaving us
with signals which have statistical entropies consistently higher than
we'd expect of a typical recording with similar perceptual
characteristics. That is, the encoded signal will appear manifestly random
compared to typical unencoded material from a similar source, and we can
easily see there is hidden communication going on. Such encodings will be
of little value in the context of industrial strength steganography used
for hidden communication.
Steganography used in the latter sense will also have to be imperceptible,
true, but but here the entropic gap we're filling is the one between the
entropy estimates of our best model of the source material vs. that of the
adversary's. Be the models Markov ones, perceptual, something else, or
composites of the above. Consequently the margin is much thinner
(bandwidths are probably at least a decade or two lower), and the aims
remain completely separate.
Consequently, I don't believe encodings developed for the first purpose
could ever be the best ones for the latter, or that HDCD-like endeavors
really have that much to do with the subject matter of this list.

Precisely. In terms of the efficient market hypothesis, all arbitrage
possibilities will usually have been exploited by others, so the only
consistent way to get a net win is to bring new information into the
market. Nowadays insiders can do that, so they win. But the only reason
they have their fresh information is that corporations do not give out the
details of their work as they unveil, before individual decision makers
can easily interfere with their knowledge of the aggregates. Hence, the
free market actually encourages full disclosure, in the exact form the No

trading, which ought to be a powerful incentive to any management. What

It's tragic, really. The market usually tends to more democracy and

It wouldn't leak, and I've never really understood why standard ATAPI
drives don't allow access to the raw data. As you say, that sort of tool
would have quite a number of applications besides piracy. For example,
taking MP3 backups of my CD's, I already would have needed error
concealment, a feature CD-ROM's do not implement when ripping audio. You
can't implement that well without knowing where the error correction step
failed, and that data isn't easily available.
Also, I've always been fascinated by the fact that there's really no
reason to follow the CD specs beyond 8/14 modulation other than
compatibility. A writing drive capable of working at such a low level
could be used to experiment with new encodings beyond what standard CD's
can do -- say, substituting CIRC with RSBC and gaining some extra room on
the disc, getting rid of the subchannels, a more intelligent coding of
disc addresses... Breaking compatibility wouldn't be too useful, but it

But that's just the point. They need to have the raw signal available at
one time or another. Picking it up and sending it down the line should be
utterly trivial, too. It will have its price, but the price will also be
negligible. Especially since the ATAPI protocol has steadily grown more
complicated, which would suggest they are making libraries to handle it in
a standardised fashion. If they have such a library, and the raw data, why
shy away from yielding it to the user? I mean, the cost is far less than,
say, implementing digital rippping capability in the first place, with the
available chips.
I'd guess either because of a) terminal stupidity or b) benefits to scale
in making it sure people go with compatibility. As there probably have to
be some limits to how stupid engineers capable of making things like

Provided there's a nonlinearity, effective in the ultrasonic range,
somewhere. Mere interference (which is what we usually refer to as
"beats") doesn't give rise to intermodulation. The beat, it isn't an
audible frequency per se, but double the frequency you'd need to amplitude
modulate a sinusoid halfway between the original sinusoids to get an
equivalent result.
You can do it with a single beam, too. MIT's Sonic Spotlight is one
example, but there are better developed applications on the market.
However, you need huge amplitudes to get the air to distort. (I've heard
numbers in the 130-150dB range.)
I don't think it would. Before the nonlinearity gets to do its job, the
sound needs to be conducted to the inner ear. But it probably won't be --
our ossicles and the tympanic membrane are too massive to operate in that
frequency range.
So I agree if the amplitudes are extreme, but otherwise I doubt it.

system state will become short of dataloss outside the current working
set, but we do need to be sure all crypto and plaintext I/O relevant state
is properly purged from memory and peripherals. There are plenty of
examples like printer buffers, random pools, already keyed smartcards,
anything you're currently showing on-screen (I wouldn't be surprised if
that could be read after sustained powerdown), any battery backed memory,
off-the-shelf peripherals which do not admit crypto, and so on. Probably
we'd also want to make the machine as dead as possible, shutting down any
remote power-on features, network connections (otherwise retries might go

I'd argue to the contrary. First, "most people have nothing to hide".
The folks will want digicash for reasons other than anonymity, as argued
by this particular "inventor" (I've wanted to handle my cash automatically
eversince I got my first debit card). Second, once the cash is online,
it's considerably easier to pool it, confuse the authorities about it,
connect it to the existing anonymity infrastructure, build secondary
services which allow its origin to be completely masked, and so on.
These sorts of hacks can well bridge the gap between ordinary cash/credit
and truly anonymous online specie. They aren't the final solution, but
they can help overcome the chicken and egg problem inherent in all

I only objected to the notion that all digicash needs to be anonymous in
order to be desirable. I didn't say this particular system amounts to
desirable weak digicash. To that end it would likely make far more sense
in the short term e.g. to marry Visa Electronic to PayPal. In the long
term multiple cooperating PayPal-like entities could then be used to build
mixnets, making the digicash strongly anonymous.
As for Morlock Elloi's objection, what you have on your bank account *is*
money, and debit cards simply a technological quirk which allows us to
access it. Furthermore, any medium of indirect exchange is by definition
money and at least Merriam-Webster defines cash as "ready money". So we
might define cash as the most liquid form a money available. After that we
can claim that in the presence of ubiquitous debit capability and a
steadily growing aversion towards those using paper money, the latter is
not in fact cash at all, but a less liquid cash (bits on a mainframe)
substitute used when we're willing to pay a premium (in convenience and
depreciation) for anonymity.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Maybe It's Snake Oil All the Way Down 
I don't think the cost of listening into a single call is the primary
issue, regardless of transmission technology. There are extra costs to
tracking a mobile user, true, but from the standpoint of law enforcement
agencies, these costs are rather minimal. (From the standpoint of a
private eavesdropper the difference is much greater, since the subject is
mobile and one cannot take advantage of the centralized points of failure
of the mobile communications network.) Rather it's the fact that the Big
Brother doesn't have the necessary total funds, and so doesn't listen into
a considerable proportion of calls as a whole.
The implication is, as the costs go down, it becomes possible to listen
into more calls, and the fear goes up. Especially so when speech
recognition and subsequent pattern analysis become computationally
feasible at a wider scale. When this is the case, it should be expected
that the use of crypto goes up. But right now, even people who "have
something to hide" do not perceive cleartext communication to be a risk
worth expending resources to thwart.
Why? As I see it, this is fundamentally an economic question, not a
technical one. It's about the risk of somebody listening in, taking notice
and acting adversely to the talker's own interest, versus speaking what
one wants without having to take expensive precautions. Currently such
risks mostly materialize when one *truly* has something to hide, that is,
one talks about something criminal, there is reason to believe law
enforcement agencies might be listening and one talks in terms which will
reasonably lead to conviction in the right circumstances.
The probability of that happening is surprisingly low, especially from the
security professional's somewhat paranoid viewpoint.
True. But in average people will shortly notice the development, and
prepare from there on. So far they haven't, and for a good reason -- such
surveillance is far too uncommon and inconsequential to actually be
Of course, if encrypted communications become dirt cheap and are properly
spun in the media, people will take on -- negligible cost combined with a
serious threat thwarted is a sure sell. This would be good, too, since the
risks of insecure communication tend to be sizable and also materialize
rarely -- those are precisely the circumstances in which people suffer
from the worst errors of judgment. But present, I think the costs
of real security seriously outweight the benefit, for most people. That
might change as much as a result of what people themselves do/think, as as
a result of what the Man, the Hacker or the technologically sophisticated
Neighbour does. Until such a change, crypto is, sadly, a fringe thing. No
matter how it's used.
Or just your neighbour. I mean, it doesn't take a cop, or a spy, or even a
an immoral person to listen in on you. All it takes is a little curiosity.
There's plenty of that going around.
couple of months of full-time effort. In no case more than half a year at
full steam.
The question is, who has a) the time, and b) the energy? Few do.
If it's feasible to encrypt the phone-to-base station link, it's equally
feasible to encrypt end-to-end. It's also cheap enough to do what PGP et
al. do, that is, combine public key methods with symmetric ones to achieve
both efficiency in in-band operation and convenience with key
distribution. Thus, there's no need to distinguish E2E encryption from the
rest, even in mobile, low-power equipment. If you need security, you might
as well do it right.
Try GSM's data features. They have extra error correction, true, and so
lower rates than the primary voice codec, but combined with the kinds of
high end voice codecs as the GSM halfband one, you can fit perfectly
usable speech within the data standard. After that, you don't even have to
worry about modulation -- you can just send bits. Fitting strong crypto
into that is ridiculously easy, and also relatively cheap.
Huh? Bare on-the-air encryption only proofs you against nosy neighbours
and the attendant probability of one of them giving you in for something
illegal. Those probabilities are quite low, compared to what "someone with
something to hide" would fear from law enforcement. E2E protects you
against both the threats, at little, no, or negative extra cost -- if your
chosen mobile standard permits access to a variant of the basic digital
interface, you can design you own protocol, usually with no more than half
the bitrate lost to FEC. Better voice codecs tend to be able to deal with
that, as witnessed by GSM's half rate codec. Consequently E2E's a pure win
compared to trusting your mobile provider.
But it also needn't be more expensive. In fact it's likely that in digital
incarnations of the mobile phone system, E2E's actually cheaper than the
alternative protocol change, provided the standard permits access to some
variant of the basic, digital interface. If you can send numbers, crypto
is easy to add on, it's not too difficult to add a proper, low-rate voice
codec, and so you have both intelligible voice and industrial strength

(I'm not sure whether I should write anything anytime soon, because of Len Sassaman's untimely demise. He was an idol of sorts to me, as a guy who Got Things Done, while being of comparable age to me. But perhaps it's equally valid to carry on the ideas, as a sort of a nerd eulogy?)
Personally I've slowly come to believe that options within crypto  protocols are a *very* bad idea. Overall. I mean, it seems that pretty  much all of the effective, real-life security breaches over the past  decade have come from protocol failings, if not trivial password ones. Not from anything that has to do with hard crypto per se.
So why don't we make our crypto protocols and encodings *very* simple, so as to resist protocol attacks? X.509 is a total mess already, as Peter Gutmann has already elaborated in the far past. Yet OpenPGP's packet format fares not much better; it might not have many cracks as of yet, but it still has a very convoluted packet structure, which makes it amenable to protocol attacks. Why not fix it into the simplest, upgradeable structure: a tag and a binary blob following it?
Not to mention those interactive protocols, which are even more difficult to model, analyze, attack, and then formally verify. In Len's and his spouse's formalistic vein, I'd very much like to simplify them into a level which is amenable to formal verification. Could we perhaps do it? I mean, that would not only lead to more easily attacked protocols, it would also lead to more security...and a eulogy to one of the new cypherpunks I most

No. There is also the concept of a rational bubble, where people invest into something because both them and the others settle into a rational game-theoretic balance where everybody thinks everybody else values a commodity, hence they value the commodity themselves, and thus the commodity in question continues to be valued indefinitely. A cycle involving boom and bust is just a special case of a rational bubble, and a very specific one, whereas the general case doesn't much predict any The general case also involves stable valuation of the commodity in question, when some real backing is present. Which would then usually be called a (fiat) currency, or (an unbacked) security. As soon as such a commodity establishes liquid markets wrt other commodities, it has a real chance of becoming a bona fide currency. No matter where it came Take for example Virginia tobacco at its time. It became a medium of exchange, and it remained so long after it had lost its use value by spoilage, in individual cases.
BitCoins perhaps aren't backed up by anything, but so aren't useless cigarettes or fiat-pieces-of-paper. Nevertheless, the latter work just fine. (Modulo independent, political and macroeconomic concerns over whether they're the best possible currency.)
BitCoins are of course far short of the real cryptocash that we'd want. But their worst problem isn't about bad economics, practical monetary concerns, or whathaveyou. Now it's finally about perfecting the engineering, and about how to advertise to the masses that this sort of thing now finally exists.

@_subject: [cryptography] Is BitCoin a triple entry system? 
I would tend to disagree here. It's not too difficult to defraud with  double entry, either: just appear sloppy. Yes, I know, the system's value is usually painted as deriving from this primitive form of error  correction, consistency checking and redundancy. But really I think it's  more about something else -- equally trivial -- that took me a long time  to figure out since the accounting literature doesn't much help you there.
I think that something has to do with the asynchronous,  multiple-input-multiple-output nature of how a firm operates, and people's highly limited ability to deal with more than one single thing or aspect of things at any one time. This dawned on me when I had to partake in a scheme used to manage a collective liqueur cabinet. It eventually evolved all by itself into a double entry system, which I went on to describe in
 .
Thus, I think that we shouldn't be considering the trusted (distributed)  third party in BitCoin on an equal footing with the innovation of double  entry. Fundamentally I see them as performing separate roles, with the  trusted verifier being the only one that has relevance wrt security. A  better comparison in the world of accounting would be how receipts are  kept, balanced cleared, different ledgers compared with each other by an  independent accountant, or perhaps procedures where different people own  different accounts and need to establish mutual trust upon a transaction  before accepting it.
Well, there's also the point about Byzantine failure tolerance. At the  very minimum it always takes three parties to guarantee that even a single malfunctioning party can be reliably voted down. That's why mirroring wouldn't be any good by itself, without the independent check from the underlying error correcting code. BitCoin goes with the general version, and tries to limit each party from having more than one vote (or too many votes) by imposing a computational challenge which is economically limiting "in the real world".

Since I've been forced to take yet another look into BitCoin and  algorithmic (high frequency) trading within a short timespan, I began to  wonder how they would work together. What precisely would happen to  BitCoin if we had tens to tens of thousands of high frequency traders  (thousands of transactions per second per trader) within the network?
I haven't been able to come up with any substantive claim about what that would lead to, but it at least seems possible that we could hit some limits within the distributed log algorithm which could lead to significant economies of scale in producing new blocks. Even if we actively sparsify the history -- simply knowing about what to start the process with could be bandwidth heavy, and keeping up with all of the eventually false block chains given that bandwidth could necessitate very high end hardware with an unusual, mainframe-kind I/O-cycles balance. If that were to happen, it could centralize the verification activity to a degree that is amenable to takeover, for simple economic reasons. Alternatively, the distributed algorithm could simply become choked to a degree via bandwidth constraints (not processing cycles) that would lead to enough time inconsistency within the cloud to make it almost impossible for it "to prune the bush into a Do you think something like this could happen? Is it a viable failure  scenario? I fear this especially because the incentive payment for block  creation isn't in any way divisible between those who tried, which means  that winner takes all, and so that with very high rates of transactions,  only highly centralized and massive scale processing plants can expect to reap a benefit from block processing which is statistically within usual financial timescales.
(That is, the reward from contributing processing power to the system  isn't divisible, unlike BTC's themselves. I can't for example run a low  power mining operation and expect to get .000001 BTC in a reasonable time, whereas somebody with more power statistically will have it in a shorter time. That's a clear benefit to scale, because people do not have infinite liquidity, and aren't risk neutral.)
(And yeah, this is mostly about economics still. But since BitCoin is a  cryptographic protocol, this stuff speaks to the threat model and the  incentive design which is integral to why the protocol is designed the way it is. Thus, also to now the protocol should be developed to reincentivize

The general statistical attack pattern is correlate, accumulate and intersect.
