@_subject: 100 consecutive composite numbers 
If N is the product of all prime numbers less than k, then
the numbers N+2,N+3,...,N+k are all composite.  This is the
best upper bound that I can find without doing a brute force
I wrote a Maple program to search for the first prime gap of
100 or more.  I am not a programmer, so please don't laugh too hard:
  for i from 100 to 1500000 by 100
  while nextprime(i) - prevprime(i) < 100 do
  od;
The result is that there are no prime numbers between
370261 and 370373.
