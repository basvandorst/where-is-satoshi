@_subject: Help in SF 
I have an activist friend in SF (Mission Street Area) who needs help to set up email in a safe, good way. He can receive mail in, but has trouble sending out. He needs help in determining if there are bugs and also to create privacy. He doesn't have a lot of computer experience. Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated. If you email me and get no response until Thursday, it is because I'm out of the office and will not be able to read my mail until my return.

Dear Cypherpunks,,
I have a native american activist friend, who lives near Albuquerque, and who is currently not connected to the net. He wishes to find information about net connectivity and also has concerns about privacy of electronic communication. Is there anyone out there who can assist? Thank you very much,

Hi. Netta suggested I write you about joining your list, or at least that's what I think she said. We were at CFP '94 and a lot was goining on simultaneously. My name is Mara Whitney and you can reach me at maraw at fs-
