i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
haha, that's my girl. really really happy.
i was chuckling while i cooked thinking about how my irish grandparents always had a plaque on their wall with this prayer on it: "may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows your dead" ha! 2. to keep the bedrooms clear i throw all the dirty laundry in the laundry room and shut the door. out of sight, out of mind! she's cute
trust me, you'll want her working her magic on you. my happy little life
and i love it (thanks, coco). may the light always find you on a dreary day.
the best part of dinner was the irish soda bread- it was so so good, and it's really easy to make. 1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making. i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
there's a tiny restaurant
i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. pps- our topic of convo for the night was this article from the wall street journal.
but then again, we looove roadtrips.
let's give a hand to the world, for everything it can do!! we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. i am trying to be a patient, kind mom.
