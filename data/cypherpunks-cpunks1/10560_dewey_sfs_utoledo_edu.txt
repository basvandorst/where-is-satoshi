@_subject: firewall 
Hey 	
I want to see if my girl is cheating on me by hacking into her e-mail account at school. Now i know enough about here to bypass her pass pretty easily but i however don't know the best way to go about getting to her account. She uses a network based e-mail account through Eudora 4.3. How do I get through their firewall. The school is a small
private catholic high school so their firewall is not teh best out there i am sure of that.
