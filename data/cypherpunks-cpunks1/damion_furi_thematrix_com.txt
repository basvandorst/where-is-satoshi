RL|Beyond having the willies.. This is more than just scary, it feels like
rape when you think about it for awhile. Everything you buy, on credit, is
recorded and sold to someone who wants to know your secrets. Everytime
you make a banking transaction, someone is watching and compiling the
        It's not just credit anymore.  If you buy something at Radio
        Shack, even with cash, they want you to give all your info
        voluntarily and they _will_ give you flack if you don't
        cooperate (which can be short-circuited by threatening to cause
        a scene or by suggesting loudly that  has lower
        prices).
        Anyway, most of what you're wanting to protect aren't secrets,
        at least in the sense of being sensitive material.  It's our
        privacy, our solitude, and our peace of mind that's under
        attack.
RL|Is there any legal recourse to get your name removed from the sellable list?
Or is it too late and we can not save even the vestiges of our privacy?
        There's a place in D.C. you can write to that will put a block
        on some lists, but not all (I don't have the address anymore).
        We're screwed.

BU|In fact it's not difficult.  It's quite simple to estlablish new identity
for the individual willing to risk the charges and consequences of
exposure.  The basic impediment is time.  Good credit doesn't come
overnight.  The second impediment is tax evasion- which is less than
justifiable in the United States on the grounds of privacy.  If you're
willing to be patient, and pay taxes on more than one name, its easy to
maintain several identities.
        A lot of "ifs" there.  Not to mention the expense.

BU|Which tells me how serious you really are about your privacy.  You have
made a decision here about how much trouble privacy is worth to you,
which is "not much."
        And how many "real names" do you have off the net?
BU|I hear people bitch about privacy endlessly.  Privacy helps those who
help themselves to privacy.  I think Mr. May was precisely correct in saying
that it is so much easier and simpler for one to rely on self privacy
insurance rather than government privacy insurance.
        Certainly.  That doesn't mean that we're all going to jump
        up and maintain several aliases.  Particularly when our
        beloved Uncle Sam is quite capable of deciding that it's
        for fraudulent purposes -- which makes it a felony.
        It would be simpler and easier to start another revolutionary
        war than follow your logic.

        Maybe it doesn't.  Not that it matters.  The only reasonable
        working assumption for Clipper (or anything like it) is that

F|If all Alice's prospective customers are also resellers on the side, then I
agree that she has a problem. But how realistic is a market scenario in which
a new supplier cannot positively identify some legitimate end consumers of a
product or service ?  (I'm ignoring cases in which the market for the
product or service is only just being forged.)  This strikes me as rather
implausible, although I don't claim to have devoted a great deal of thought
to it.
        Hey, Wei, you overlooked something rather simple: suppose
        Alice wasn't any good?  Or suppose she was good, in general,
        but came up wrong at a bad time?  Whereas she might have
        corrected it in time if it had been her client and she had
        direct access, Mallet gets hit broadside out of ignorance--
        and the resulting delay from the extra link in the chain
        could easily be enough to ruin him.

TCM|We don't believe in "security through obscurity," do we? The notion that we
are "safe" if the White House, or (horrors!) Janet Reno herself, are not
reading our list or the Web sites on various issues, is the same kind of
security the ostrich thinks he has with his head in the sand and his butt
in the air.
        Maybe so, but we don't have to like it.  And I don't.  But
        it's not so much their access, per se, that I object to.
        It's their potential intentions, all things considered, and
        the fact that they aren't at all open about such monitoring.
TCM|If you want to be unheard by the Feds, and the White House, and the FBI,
and GCHQ, and Mossad, etc., then don't post publically. If you want your
own access to Web sites kept private, push for the development of Web
proxies ("Web remailers").

F|Why the hell do you care ?  Someone has a home page for something on the Web.
Someone at the White House looks at it. So what ?  You object to the fact
that somebody in the government has a Web browser and *gasp* uses it to read
stuff on the WWW ???
        What did I just write?  It's not so much their access...
> It's their potential intentions,
F|You take moral offense to what you think someone else _might_ be thinking ?
        Not normally, no.  But I've found a number of reasons to take
        offense at more overt government actions, and I see no reason
        not to take offense at obscure government actions.
        Especially when it involves spooks (NSA, DOD, military branch
        agencies, CIA, FBI, DEA, alphabet soup agency of choice).
Sounds like you believe in thoughtcrime. Banned any good books lately ?
        I _DO_ believe in thoughtcrime.  I think it's a goddamned crime
        when some dickhead with more power than sense attempts to limit
        the actions of private citizens, in complete disregard for the
        idea of "presumed innocent until proven guilty."  If someone so
        much as THINKS this, I have a problem with them.
        Now, go fuck yourself.
F|>  all things considered, and
>         the fact that they aren't at all open about such monitoring.
F|This is absurd. You expect the White House to issue a press release every tim
a staffer clicks on a URL ?
        No.  I want to know what they're monitoring on a general
        basis and why.  It's my tax money, too.  But they aren't
        open about the monitoring.  Half the time they deny doing
        it at all, and the rest of the time they come up with a
        few dozen specious excuses.
