    That makes my day.  The name Schlafly sounds familiar (I don't mean
    Phyllis).  Roger?  Does anyone know a crypto person with this name?
Well, FWIW, the woman who spends most of the year traveling around the
country telling other women to stay home has gained at least a slight
interest in crypto lately.  The Phyllis Schlafly Report  recently posted an
announcement taking an anti-Clipper position and referring to an
online `report' that they've prepared concerning Clipper.  I didn't
see anything to indicate that she'd be interested in going after PKP
however, so Roger is probably a better guess.
I have no idea whether Roger is her son or how similar their political
ideas are.

    A copy of outgoing email could be kept, acknowledgements received
    on receipt, and the email deleted or re-transmitted as needed.  Serial
    numbers would distinguish retransmissions so that redundant resendings
    (where the packets "crossed in the mail", so to speak) would be dropped.
    All this was designed in an afternoon in Xmodem.  It's conceptually easy.
    The hard part is getting a standard and getting people to build it into
    their Mail User Agents.
I think that many of the simple cases are conceptually easy, but even
slightly complicated ones are non-trivial.  For example, I tend to
include Return-Receipt-To: lines in my messages, so I get a bunch of
responses.  Interpreting those responses and deciding what action
would be appropriate raises some interesting questions, not the least
of which is ``What does it mean for a message to be successfully
delivered to the cypherpunks list?''.  Just as an example how easily
the issue can become confused, I'll throw in, ``How is the meaning of
successful delivery affected by changes in list membership during
transmission?''  Considering that some of the addresses to which
cypherpunks is distributed are also distribution lists, any list
related problems are multiplied.
Practical issues make this whole thing more difficult.  The ``getting
people to build it into their Mail User Agents'' part in particular.
The idea of a Return-Receipt-To: field has been around for a while,
but the semantics have never been pinned down.  Some mailer daemons
generate replies meaning that the bits were delivered.  Some readers
(MUAs?) generate replies based on end-user actions.
This thread of discussion got me thinking about a really sick thought
though:  Using email messages to represent UDP packets.

    ability to specify that a particular piece ofmail should be

    machine within a certain period of time.
    That's one reason I like the "enabledmail" approach.  All we have to do

    I don't care to. It is widely known and understood that structuring

A good starting place would be the hermes project (aka

restructuring took place with the *intent* to avoid the reporting

It may very well be that he only signs messages to `public' forums or
that he only signs things when he considers the message to be more
important than normal, however, the majority of the messages that he
has sent out to cypherpunks, alt.security.pgp, etc. in, say, the last
half a year or so, have been signed.  On the other hand, the one other
message that I could come up with that wasn't signed was also about
the debate.
    . . . and has talked about how difficult it is to go through the
    rigamarole of signing, authenticating, etc.
Hmmmm.  FWIW, it typically requires two keystrokes for me to do any of
the half dozen PGP operations that I do most often.  I've heard of at
least three other emacs-based interfaces for simplifying PGP
interaction and there seem to be quite a few other `helper' packages
around for other email environments.
    (I sympathize with him, and I intensely dislike getting PGP-encrypted
    messages, decrypting them, only to find a banal message that wasn't
    worth the effort.)
 Perhaps you think your E-mail is legitimate enough that encryption is
 unwarranted.  If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to
 hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards?  Why not submit to drug testing on demand?  Why require a warrant for
 police searches of your house?  Are you trying to hide something?  You must be a subversive or a drug dealer if you hide your mail
 inside envelopes.  Or maybe a paranoid nut.  Do law-abiding citizens
 have any need to encrypt their E-mail?
Ok, ok, so the above paragraph is blatant plagiarism (it's from
pgpdoc1 for anyone who didn't recognize it).  I encrypt most
point-to-point communications with other PGP users on principle,
regardless of the content.  In any case, I find it quite disappointing
to hear that one of the cypherpunks founders frowns on people actually
using strong crypto on a routine basis.  Sigh...

As to the security, using PGP in the way that I do routinely is more
secure than not using it -- the number of people who have the special
access that would ease the cracking effort is limited.  Also, the key
that I advertise is not my only key.  To the best of my knowledge, my

I don't suppose that you'd care to describe a situation with

If not, can we conclude that any attempt to do anything related to

What's wrong with the following approach:
 - Try to control what you can control.
 - Try to recognize what you cannot control.
 - Try to reduce the second set in favor of the first.

    1. Only one person has reported to me that they were unable to verify
    my PGP sig (Lance Cottrell reported this...if others did, maybe their
    messages haven't gotten through to me)). From this I conclude that few
    people check PGP sigs.
A safer conclusion would be that few people report signature failures,
although I suspect that your conclusion is also correct.
I noticed that your message's signature failed, but chose not to
report it.  As I recall, it failed because I didn't have the
appropriate key, although I do have your 0x54E7483F key and the key
that it appeared to be signed with wasn't available from the MIT key
I also noticed Bill Stewart's signature failure on Message-Id:

In both cases, I assumed that the sender was trying to spoof the act
of signing and I further assumed that you were more careful to match
the form of a signed message than Bill was.  The fact that you've been
doing some spoofing lately only strengthened by sense that this was
another gag.
Often, but not always, when I see a Bad Signature message I let the

What do you mean?  If you mean that fewer than 1% of the signed
messages that are sent to cypherpunks, you're almost certainly
incorrect.  I read over 1% of the messages on this list and if a
message is signed, with either a header signature or a big-ugly-block
signature, it's checked before I get to read it.
If you count seperate deliveries as seperate messages then you're
almost certainly correct, although it seems like an uninteresting data
point.  If you're talking about clear-signed messages sent to the net
as a whole rather than just this list, I think it's an interesting
question, but I can't imagine what you're basing your suspicion on.

    It does not matter who the true identity associated with a
    public key is.  My proposal is only that signatures
    be checked for consistent identity, not true name.
Hmmm.  I thought that you had also suggesting that this mechanism
should ``autonag every nym to send a public key in'' which I thought
raised the question of ``Where do you send the autnoag messages?''
Perhaps you meant for the autonag to be a notice attached to the

    My point was that if some of the autonag messages go astray, or are
    deliberately misled, who cares?
I suspect that LD would love to play around with this feature.  Spoof
a letter from someone and you can make the cypherpunks send that
person some hate mail.  Basically, I just think it's a mistake.  I
think that annotating a message as it passes through cypherpunks --
such as cypherpunks at hks.net does -- is a fine idea.  However, I think
that adding new ways for attackers to make privacy advocates look bad
isn't a great idea.
    The proposed system is for everyone, not just pseudonyms.  If I
    meant pseudonyms, I would have said pseudonyms, not nyms.
I understood that and followed the same convention.  I'm not worried
about pseudonyms -- they land in the bit bucket somewhere.  I'm more

    My thanks to Tim for his comments on my post:
        Maybe, but the state has a wonderful scam of paying off a "5 million
        dollar jackpot" over 20 years; the true value (what the same deal
        would cost you to buy as an annuity) is less than $5 M, possibly much
        less. If private outfits did this, they'd be jailed.
Publisher's Clearinghouse is a private outfit which does this.
    Yes, but the return is still 50%.
I have no idea whether the return on California Lotto is 50%, however
if this claim ignores the discounted value of future cashflows, that
is, the fact that a dollar that you have today is worth more than a
dollar that you will receive in the future, then it is a bogus claim.
        > Calculation of "x" is not "simple", since you also have to figure in

        Oh, I see you mentioned this scam. (Calculation should still be
        simple, as any spreadsheet can handle discounted present values and
        the like.)
    Not simple for me.  If it's simple for you (or anyone reading this) I
    would be interested in the results of the calculation.  Recall "x" is
    either the number of times the jackpot must be passed or the nominal
    value of the grand prize for which there is a positive return for the
    player (assume no prize split).  You might work this out for time
    values of money of 5-10-15% per annum.
This guesswork is unnecessary as their is an active and liquid market
for future dollars.  If your maximum prize is $10MM divided into 30
annual cashflows, you can go out to the market and price comparable
securities to determine the fair market value.  In fact, if you just
won, you can go out today and sell your future cashflows for their
discounted value.
If you want to skip the bond math, you could get a reasonable ballpark
on a lower bound by looking at the prices on 30 year treasuries, as
long as you realize that you are ignoring differences in credit risk
and cashflow schedules.

         OTOH, we owe it to him to respect his opinion. If he didn't have the
    guts to create the tool, this conversation would be moot. I say that we
    should respect his wishes, and not bastardize PGP, if only not to
    discourage other people to write "risky" software
Definitely.  While I don't believe that Phil has legal grounds to make
Tom stop bastardizing PGP, I think that he has every right to protect
his reputation and proclaim loudly that he considers Tom's
modifications snake oil, etc.
I suspect that most people would respect Phil's wishes in this area,

    I don't think that he can stop him from making any modifications
    to PGP, but I think that he can stop him from using the name PGP
    on it.  I think that he has every right to do this.
Well, perhaps every right except for a legal right.
Of course, as I mentioned somewhat obtusely earlier, there's no
precedent to work from, but (a version of) PGP was released under the
terms of the GPL.  Not "everything but the name of PGP" or "just the
code of PGP".  PGP is GPLed and Tom is legally free to bastardize it
and continue to call it PGP based on the GPL.
FWIW, the guy who developed the GPL believes that people who have
taken GNU Emacs and done things to it which are unacceptable to him --
the the schism -- are completely free to use the name GNU Emacs.
Because they are derivative works of GNU Emacs and GNU Emacs is GPLed,
they are in his words "by definition" GNU Emacs.
Tom's bastardization is similarly "by definition" PGP.  It's
intentional anarchy and I think that it's a Good Thing, despite the
fact I support Phil's right to call it snake oil (and I tend to agree
with him).

     How to legally circumvent the PGP 2.6 Legal Kludge.
[ Analysis of and clever workaround for legal_kludge deleted ]
    This kludge may seem to be too kludgy! It is asking a lot to ask users
    to type such a thing! But is this really a problem? Most users do not
    invoke PGP directly. They usually invoke PGP thru a mail program or
    some other shell program.  These shell programs can be easily modified
    to do the right thing.  In the worst case, people could define a shell
    alias to invoke pgp with the incantation!
    This discovery will allow people who must use PGP 2.6 to communicate
    with people with earlier versions of PGP!
All of this is true.  As someone who decided to start using 2.6, and
who typically invokes it indirectly, I will start using it.  However,
Bizdos and buddies have still succeeded to some extent.  Some people
will use 2.6 without any attempt to bypass legal_kludge.  Also
Detweiler . . . I mean, Sue . . . may already be sending 800 zillion

But, nothing prevents you from acting on an individual level to make

to believe that effective strategies exist for keeping such data bases
When such things have the force of law behind them, they are more

    - From an individual rights point of view, the assumed government
    "social contract" is bogus because it is not voluntary.
With respect to many taxes, for example income tax in the US, it is
voluntary.  You avoid entering into the social contract very simply:
don't interact with the society.  Actually, you can even play a little
without paying -- very legally -- by never choosing to extract from
society a net income greater than the lowest income tax bracket.  Some
war tax avoiders have done this for decades.  Some even make
reasonable amounts of money and give most of it away.
If you wish to avoid having the negative penalties of the social
contract, you simply avoid accepting the positive benefits.  If you
don't require the society, don't participate in it -- at all.  Any
`income' that you acquire without interacting with society will not be
taxed.  This route is not for everyone.  Most people prefer to enter
into the contract.
Yes, I'm being more than a bit facetious here, but not completely.
I not only respect, but I agree with most of the complaints typically
voiced by the `libertarian' segment here, but the extremes of the
economic arguments are ridiculous.  Some -- certainly not all or even
most -- manage to come off sounding like spoiled teenagers:
``Everything that I have I have completely because of my own doing and
the fact that there's this social structure all around me had nothing
at all to do with it.''
There is a degree to which a social contract is not a completely
unreasonable thing.  Of course, most (all?) government's to date have
gone about a zillion times overboard . . . .
Ok, now the cypher connection.  I've been working on, and using, a
package to add PGP support to Emacs-based messaging.  I call it PGP
Enhanced Messaging (PEM), a blatant rip-off of an already used
acronym.  It is initially targeted at doing sign (standard or as an
X-PGP-Signed header), verify signature, encrypt, sign-and-encrypt,
decrypt, extract key block, and insert key block.  Lots more on the
wish list :-)
npgp.el defines region oriented PGP operations.  The process
interaction is different than other packages in that it runs PGP
asynchronously and notices when PGP asks questions and passes them up
to the user.
pem.el defines message oriented operations.  It knows about message
headers and bodies, etc., but is not tied to any specific package.
The user layer is a set of interfaces to other packages.  Currently
there's pem-mhe.el (works with mh-e.el, an interface to MH) and
pem-gnus.el (works with GNUS).  Since pem.el does most of the work,
new interfaces should be relatively easy.  A pem-vm and pem-rmail
would be nice, but they're not my top priority.
If you're interested in Alpha testing let me know.  Basically, it
works fine in my environments (Sparc-10, SunOS-4.1.3, lemacs-19.10 at
work, fsf-19.24 at home), but the first Alpha tester has demonstrated
lots of places where environment differences, different Emacs
customizations, etc. cause problems.
When it's a bit more stable, I'll ask for Beta testers, probably here
and on a newsgroup or two.

    I accept the terms of the 4th ammendment [sic]: search and siezure

The 4th amendment:
       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,

    shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon
    probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
    particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons
    or things to be seized.
One problem with what you've said is that the fourth amendment is not
phrased in the sense in which you refer to it.  Specifically, it
proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures.  It does not require
the people to actively facilitate the government in `reasonable'
searches and seizures.  Essentially, you've turned the 4th amendment
on its head in your effort to rationalize key escrow.
In any case, it's a purely academic question given the dissociation of

So, anything that you send to cypherpunks also goes to this loser, who
then can associate your two identities.  Since your an*

It's possible that this person is simply ignorant rather than
malicious.  Subscribing as na111447 at anon.penet.fi would have given the
subscription anon.penet.fi-level security without compromising other
users of that service.
The people with the most exposure are those who use anon.penet.fi but
who do not use the X-Anon-Password feature.  If you use a password and
send a message to cypherpunks, you should get a message from
anon.penet.fi saying that you forgot to use your password when you
sent the message, but the loser will not get the (un)anonymized
version of your cypherpunks message.  Of course, there's marginal
security even with the password feature as the password is transmitted

    Anyone have any better ideas for a secure crypto way of doing this? ;)
Create your message.  Using PGP, generate a new key pair.  Use the
public key to encrypt the message, then throw it away.  Send the
secret key along with the message.  Have the signature for the secret
key be the NYT headline for the day on which you want the data to be
available :-)
Stepping back from the details of various crypto approaches, I think
that the problem is that you want a locking mechanism to be based on
data.  Since you want a time lock, the data has to be directly
associated with time.  For this to work, you need to create data that
is unknowable until a certain time.  If the data is known to you,
you've come full circle: you're new goal is your original goal.  If
the data is not known to you, it needs to be something which the other
party cannot deduce prior to the expiration of your time lock.  To be
confident that no one could deduce this information, a prerequisite
would have to be that you couldn't deduce it, that is, it wouldn't be
something that you could use as part of an encryption.
I think that this problem ultimately requires a trust based mechanism.

@_subject: Remailer REORDER not DELAY 
I think that there's a reasonable compromise in here somewhere.  It
might even address some other concerns that people could have about
the costs of running remailers, e. g. storing a zillion messages for
24 hours.
How about something like this:
 - The remailer is configured by its maintener with a maximum
   desireable time delay and a maximum desireable message queue size.
   People who do not like the values selected are free to shop
   elsewhere :-)
 - When a message arrives, it is assigned a latest output time based
   on the time that it is received, the remailers maximum desireable
   time delay and a random factor.
 - When the remailer's message queue size is greater its maximum
   desireable size, the message due to be sent next is sent regardless
   of its latest output time.
 - When a message's latest output time arrives, it is sent regardless
   of the remailers message queue size.
You might even want to have some other remailer configuration
parameters, like:
 - a maximum number of messages sent out during some arbitrary time
   interval (message/minute, e. g.)
 - a minimum interval between messages being sent.
These two examples might force the queue size to be considerably
larger than its maximum desired size during usage peaks.
None of this addresses a situation where a single message is received
during an arbitrarily long time period, although none of the other
proposals addresses that situation.  Although I can imagine how Mallet
might abuse this if he coudl control the remailer's net connection,
personally, I don't think that it's a problem that merits much
consideration.  In the absense of a suitably powerful Mallet or other
serious networking problems, it's likely that such a situation is just
an indication that the remailer isn't very popular.
BTW, what possible benefit is there to knowing that a particular
message was sent by a particular remailer?  As a recipient, should I
`trust' a remailer more than I trust, say, a digitial signature from
the sender?  Could someone describe a situation where this would
provide useful information?  In other words, why *not* simply encode
with the recepient's public key and restrict the usage of the
remailer's private to decoding incoming messages?

    . . . it's NP-complete if you can prove that equivalence to
    another NP-complete problem).
    The "NP" part is "Non-deterministic, polynomial time".  What that means
    is that there is a solution possible in polynomial time (rather than
    exponential time) *ONLY* on a *NON-DETERMINISTIC* machine.
Not true.  What that means is that a polynomial time solution exists
for an NFA.  The only part has not been shown.
    And that's the fun part, because a non-deterministic machine is
    one that *guesses* the correct path every time it has a choice to
    make.
That's one way of viewing it, well close anyway.  Typically it's
described as guessing the correct path and then verifying its
correctness.  Another, equally valid way to view a non-deterministic
machine is as one which executes all paths simultaneously.
    Clearly, in real life, this doesn't happen.
Perhaps.  In any case, if you have a proof that the NP-Complete
problems cannot be done in polynomial time on a deterministic machine,
by all means, please share it with us . . . and collect your prize :-)

    While we're being picky, I'll point out that (unless I'm wrong of

on one of these phones?

    I'd say that it would work far better if things were changed to MIME
    formats. You would send a message by recursively encapsulating your
    message to be remailed inside a MIME message. Simple and clean...
Personally, I vastly prefer that things that can be handled with
header lines be handled that way.
MIME may be general and handle messages with mixed data, but the
Big-Ugly-Block style that everything seems to be moving to is, well,
overly big and overly ugly.
When the data in a message is of a single type, adding all of this
ugly MIME bulk is neither simple nor clean.  It's artificial
complexity and needless blecherousness.
Recursive encapsulation needn't affect how any particular level looks.

    Right now we are basically having the remailing commands be mail
    header fields.  But really people aren't supposed to just make up
    new fields like that.  I think the "name space" of these fields is
    protected somewhat more than many other aspects of communication
    protocols on the net.
If you start your header name with X-, then you are conforming that
gross, ugly atrocity that is MIME.  And yet, by using headers rather
than TGUATIM, you help to preserve sanity and avoid that vast majority
of MIME slime.
Note that I'm not suggesting that MIME has no place.  When you truly
need to mix data types and you *want* the different parts to be easily
processed by all, it makes perfect sense.
Given the privacy goals of a remailing, MIME has only disadvantages.
    Is there precedent for adding service-by-mail functionality in
    this way?  I am not completely comfortable with it.  And as we
    think of new functionality and new commands they all have to get
    added at this top level, the same visibility and name space as
    "Subject", "From", and "To".
So, do what you have to in C and C++-sans-namespaces, use a prefix.
X-RM- could prefix the Remailer namespace.  It's ugly, but compared to
the alternative it is pure beauty.

If by this, you mean to follow more of the model used by
remail at extropia.wimsey.com, then I completely agree.  What travels in
the clear should not *require* any header data.  It could even include
misleading headers.  A remailer should be able to accept mail which is
encrypted for it.  It can then decode the encrypted part and discard
the rest.  The format of the decrypted message could be whatever works
best for remailers which might or might not have anything at all to do
with MIME.
OTOH, if you are going to have information in the clear to support
naive users or whatever, put the information in the header.  The whole
purpose of headers is for auxiliary information about the message and
its delivery.  The body is for the message itself.
With MIME's approach of making every piece of information as big and
clunky as possible, I'm mildly suprised that it hasn't done away with
headers altogether :-)

    A very interesting claim.  Care to tell me what my "false claims" are,
    or is it a secret?
One is your claim that ``"X-" headers have nothing whatsoever to do
with MIME.''  This was in response to my suggestion that such headers
were MIME-compliant.  As I said previously, unless you are claiming
that MIME violates the RFC which you referenced, then these headers
are MIME compliant, as I suggested, rather than completely seperated
from MIME as you have suggested.

as much as I should, by your judgement, however your claim is still
incorrect -- presumably you were more interested in being

Really, there was nothing very secretive about my previous or current
presentation of the problems with your claims.  For example, you might
note that the first one that I list is simply a rewording of the

    In this model, who deals with mailbombs/spams/requests for address blocks?
With sameer's recently announced RIAB, it seems quite reasonable that
Tim could follow the instructions that were sent out and when he gets
to this one:
 3) If you wish, you can setup a .forward file to point to mailfilters
 or to another account. then he could do this:
 % echo 'tcmay at netcom.com' > ~/.forward
and then he would never have to log into c2 again.
This is not quite at the level of what Tim explicitly stated:
``remailer account owner does nothing more than pay for the
account.'', but it's about as close as one could hope for while
addressing your concerns.
Of course, Tim could adopt `hands off' administation by doing any of
the following:
 - forwarding to /dev/null
 - using auto-bounce script
 - forwarding to tcmay at netcom.com, but ignoring all mail related to
   his remailer.
It might be a good idea to check that sameer thinks this is ok.  It's
bound to piss people off more than remailers with a more interactive
administrator.  It basically says that mail bombs and spams are
acceptable and requests are pointless.

    Many companies are already founded on "a web of debt".
    "Sallie Mae (Student Loans), Ginnie Mae (General Loans), and Freddie Mac
    (Real Estate Loans)," all come to mind at the moment. They're nicely
    formatted, processed and make even more money for investors as the
    interest rates change.
Student Loans (at least GSLs) and GNMA loans are backed by ``the full
faith and credit'' of the US federal government.  As far as an
investor is concerned, loan default looks the same as if the loanee
paid their debt off early.  The `web of debt' suggestion posted here
doesn't seem to follow the same model unless you count virtually every
form of financial transaction -- including buying a cup of coffe with
a dollar bill -- as fitting the model.
As a side note, GNMA (Ginnie Mae) is not for `general loans', but
rather VA and FHA primary residence mortgages with various
restrictions.  GNMA, FNMA (Fannie Mae), and FHLMC (Freddie Mac) all
exist to provide secondary markets for various kinds of real estate

    Sallie Mae's commercial paper is NOT backed by the full     faith and credit of the US government.  They carry a specific disclaimer     to that effect.  It is true that many personal student loans (GSLs) from     banks are guaranteed by the government.  The system was recently reformed     to remove the riskless subsidy to Sallie Mae, which is 100% privately     owned, and very profitable.
    Similarly Fannie Mae and all other priavetly held GSE's are only backed     by an "implicit" federal guarantee.  Although the only time one of these     got into trouble the feds did bail it out.
I inferred (perhaps erroneously) a tone of correction in your message.
For the record, GSLs and GNMA loans were the only loans which I
explicitly claimed were backed by the full faith and credit of the US
government.  Thank you for your clarification wrt Sallie Mae.

    Extreme government leads to totalitarianism, not socialism.
This statement, as well as the one to which it is a response, confuse
decision making forces in government and government control of
economic forces.  Democratic socialism, totalitarian socialism,
democratic capitalism and totalitarian capitalism are all possible, at
least theoretically.  Moving beyond theory, one could easily claim
that no truly {democratic,totalitarian,capitalist,socialist}
society/economy has ever existed.
    Governments as a whole are seen to be "bad" because they
    invariably undermine the right of the individual to make choices
    for themselves.
Unrestrained economic powers (companies, corporations, whatever) have
the same property.  This seemed to me to be a fundamental point that
Rishab was making -- and one that is often ignored in discussions of
economic libertarianism.

    In practice, I'd probably buy Viacrypt for legal reasons but use

I'd be interesting in hearing some of the lawyers out there comment on
this.  While I know that I can test interoperability, I prefer using
something that I compiled myself which I think is not an option with
Viacrypt.  This is not to say that I could swear that I understand all
of the code that I compiled for the free versions of PGP, but (a) I
have spent considerable time looking at the parts that were most
interesting to me -- even translating some things to other programming
languages and (b) I know that others have also examined the code and
nobody has come up with anything terribly damning.

      Yes, I get the idea about spewing the signed hashes everywhere.  The
    problem I have is with the user of PGP.  That will help cypherpunks,
    but does absolutely nothing for most of our millions of users, who
    have no idea what PGP is.  Perhaps its enough to assume that if anyone
    is tampering with the distribution, some cypherpunk will stumble across
    it...
I suspect that most of these millions don't know about md5 or much of
anything in the way of strong authentication.  However, if you provide
any sure-fire mechanism by which someone could detect that the
distribution has been tampered with, it would be an improvement over
not having any.  If someone does happen to notice tampering and send
mail to cypherpunks about it, I'd guess that there's a good chance it
would be reported in major publications shortly thereafter.

    Well folks, you can go view the new PA law yourselves at URL
        PA Senate Bill 655 was signed into law on June 13, 1995, and it does
    appear to make non-logged anonymous remailers illegal.
I'm guessing that you're referring to this part of the law:
  (1) [makes or possesses any instrument, apparatus, equipment or]
  makes, distributes, possesses, uses or assembles an unlawful
  telecommunication device or modifies, alters, programs or reprograms
  a telecommunication device designed, adapted or which can be used:
  . . .
  (ii) to conceal or to assist another to conceal from any [supplier
  of telecommunications] telecommunicationservice provider or from any
  lawful authority the existence or place of origin or of destination
  of any telecommunication; or
IANAL, but this sure sounds like one could make the case that an ISP
that allowed users to send mail to arbitrary addresses,
e. g. xxx at anon.penet.fi, would be `guilty' of assisting another to
conceal the place of origin and/or destination of a telecommunication.
I'd imagine that the authorities would be a bit more likely to go
after anonymous-remailer at xxx.net however.
In fact, I wonder if the fact that mail to rfb at cmu.edu is forwarded to
rfb at lehman.com couldn't be construed as `assistance' if I happened to
receive mail at that address through penet.  Sigh . . . .

    I am also projecting a transition from physical to non-physical goods and
    services.  Thus most entertainment, financial services/investing,
    professional services, and indeed the rest of employment services will
    tend to be non-physical.  We see a lot of unbundling already in which
    services are split off from the more physical parts of a transaction.
    Drop shipping, contracting out, etc.
I agree with this projection as a shift in weight.  Presumably we can
also agree that the transition could never be total.  People will
continue to need and/or desire a significant number of physical goods
as well as services which involve the physical interaction.
    Say that it was 1750 and you were a French Physiocrat.  You might say
    that land and agriculture should
                              ^^^^^^
This single word represents a significant shift in the discussion.  Up
to this point, my understanding is that we were discussing what is,
and what we believe is possible in the future.  With the introduction
of `should' we veer away from that direction toward the more
philosophical.  While I enjoy philosophical discussions a great deal,
I doubt that we could find nearly as much common ground as we might if
we focussed on what is possible.  While I am a civil libertarian, I am
not an economic libertarian, as I believe you are.  I would expect
economic issues to be the focus of our differences in a philosophical
discussion, but they need not divide us in discussions outside of
    It is possible that the non-physical part of the economy will
    become much bigger than the physical.
I agree that this is quite possible.
    Note that most money itself is non-physical.
Agreed in part.  However, as we have seen already, non-physical
representations of money are not taken very seriously when it is
impossible, or even very difficult, to exchange them for physical
goods and services requiring physical interactions.  Very few people
would accept CyberBucks in exchange for a car.
    And if the physical part of the economy is taxed and the
    non-physical isn't the market will be skewed in favor of non-taxed
    activities.
Agreed.  This is at least partially true already.  Certainly there are
investment instruments which are treated differently by the various
tax codes.  These differences certainly affect investors' decisions.
Still, there seem to be investors willing to purchase instruments
based on features other than taxability.
    Also even though most people are geographically bound, if their
    consumption switches to non physical goods, they can acquire these goods
    anonymously or securely from any place on earth.  So even if you don't
    travel, the locus of your transactions can.
Agreed.  As I said originally, I believe that ready access to strong
cryptography will eventually make government tracking of purely
information, i. e. non-physical, transactions infeasible.  At that
point, any feasible system of taxation will have to focus on physical
goods and services which involve physical interaction.

    Vaporware which I heard around CFP '95, and have been sort of
    wondering about ever since...
    Some one told me that some one else [possibly Matt Blaze] had been
    looking at how much randomness could be got by forking two child
    processes which would just run as asynchronous clocks: whenever
    the parent program needs a little `random' bit, it queries both
    and gives (clock(A) + clock(B) % 2) or something.
I've played around with something that Matt posted here a while back
which seems to use the same idea.  Matt suggested that this appears to
emit one random bit per second.  I've done some very lightweight
analysis and haven't seen anything to suggest that the output is not
random, but I wouldn't make any bets based on what I've done.
FWIW, I discussed this code briefly with an engineer at Netscape a
while back . . . .

    Wait till Labour finds out that crypto makes "The Caring Society"     impossible.  Perhaps they'll change their view then.
Ok, I'll bite.  What do you mean?
I'm guessing that you're talking about the fact that fully applied
crypto (e. g. fully anonymous digital cash) makes it essentially
impossible to base a tax system on income.
With full application in place, a government would be forced to shift
the basis of the tax system toward `real assets' and the receiving of
goods and services within its borders.  However, outside of
transactions involving pure information exchange, this simply shifts
things from one side to the other in a relationship where the basic
ideas behind capitalism suggest that both sides should be more or less
equal.  That is, you're not taxed based on money changing hands, but
rather on the more tangible things that are the reason for the money
changing hands.  To use the over-used grocery store example, you're
taxed on what you carry out in your basket, without regard to any
money that may or may not have changed hands before during or after
you went to the store.
Earnings tend to correlate reasonable well with receiving goods and
services, at least over long periods of times.  Also most people are
more or less tied to a certain area of the world.  Certainly there are
exceptions, but the average case is more relevent when considering
what sorts of governmental policies are possible.  Given this, I think
that crypto is more likely to result in a readjustment of the details
than a fundamental change in the relationships between various
elements of society.  I don't mean to suggest that these relationships
can't or won't change, just that strong crypto is not a magic pill
that can transform everything by itself.  Fundamental changes are the
results of the interplay of a wide array of forces.

       Anyone want to lend me a hand in finding and disassembling the

    tell me how you did it. (I hope it wasn't done by single stepping thru     functions in GDB) I missed the whole Netscape RNG decompilation

Under Unix, you can use objdump, e. g.
 % objdump -d netscape
 netscape:     file format a.out-sunos-big
 No symbols in "netscape".
 Disassembly of section .text:

    I also have some doubts as to the randomness of this; I suspect
    that the kernel is rather deterministic in its scheduling
    practices.
I don't think that anyone has suggested otherwise.  I believe that
`clock skew' was the underlying source of randomness that Matt Blaze
mentioned in the message where I first saw that code.
In any case, a number of people have expressed interest in seeing
signs of non-random behavior.  As far as I know, no one has said
anything if they've found such signs.  I've tried to find some, but
only with very simple tests.  I generated a quarter megabits and found
 - I can only compress it to about 32Kb, i. e. 256 k bits.  Tim May
   has suggested that compressibility is getting to be a good metric
   for entropy.
 - It seems to contain roughly equal numbers of:
    * 0s and 1s
    * 00s, 01s, 10s, and 11s
    * etc. I forget how high I checked.
 - It contains some rather long sequences of 0s and 1s.  I think on
   the order of 20.
I have no idea how reasonable it would be to use this approach in
Netscape, however if it were available as an option to generate, say
300 bits, I'd personally be plenty willing to let it chew up five
minutes while I get my morning caffeine.  I realize that some people
would not.  It certainly couldn't hurt to throw a few bits gathered
this way into the mix.  Also, it may be possible to get more than one
bit of entropy per second using this approach, I was merely showing
the code as Matt originally presented it.

Personally, I like the Easter Eggs in Netscape and other software
products.  I don't know if there's an consensus definition of `Easter
Egg', but my working definition is something like ``An unpublicized,
unharmful, preferably amusing, feature for which interested users may
hunt.''  I think that such things add some fun for curious users and
indicate a bit of `hacker spirit' in the development team -- meaning
`hacker' in the classic sense, not the media-bastardize synonym of
`cracker'.  I also think that in Netscape their existance is an
indication that the managment at Netscape is a bit less uptight than
management at some other places.
I didn't know about the FishCam Easter Egg, but I know that Netscape
has a couple of Easter Eggs related to the activity indicator in the
top right of the display.  Typically this is the Big N logo with
animated meteors, etc. flying by when the window is active.  One
Easter Egg temporarily turns this into a compass which spins to
indicate activity.  Another causes the animation to show a dragon
(Mozilla) breathing fire for the remainder of the session.  I won't
spoil your fun by telling how to find them.

    obNetscapeHack: There is a feature called a "cookie file" in
    Netscape that is ripe for exploitation as a security leak.  If you

    can feed all sorts of information into it without the user's

    until the machine runs out of drive space.  I am sure that there
    are other exploitable holes there...  Any takers?
Yikes!  That sounds really bad.  Do you have any more information on
this?  For example, can the server write to anything other than
$HOME/.netscape-cookies?  If I write protect that file, but it's still
owned by me, will Netscape still modify it?

    > Why is there a limit to the size of the key anyway? It's too bad PGP     > doesn't support any size key (within reason).
    Within reason is the Key Phrase.  Even with a Pentium 90, I notice a     considerable lag in decrypting messages that have been encrypted with     a key larger than 2047/8.
    Even if you have a fast machine, if the person recieving the message     could wait a long time to decrypt you 4096 byte encrypted message.
Another point to realize is that PGP uses a combination of ciphers.
When encrypting, the RSA key is only used to encrypt an IDEA key.
That IDEA key is used to encrypt your message.  Somewhere between 2048
and 4096, you're making the RSA key stronger (harder to brute force)
than the IDEA key.  At that point, the extra time that you're using
for super-big RSA keys is totally wasted.
A similar argument applies to authentication, but then you're
comparing RSA and MD5, although I believe the argument holds for even
smaller RSA keys than in the RSA-IDEA comparison.

    Hmmm... Well, the 384-bit Blacknet PGP key was cracked in just a
    few months.  How?
Factoring a 384-bit number is not equivalent to searching a 384-bit
keyspace.  Consider that there are 78498 primes less than 1000000.
This means that you can do a brute force search of a keyspace of under
17-bits to find a prime factor of any composite number less than
1000000000000 -- a bit under 40 bits.  I've done this to verify the
results of an implementation of the Rabin-Miller primality test on
relatively small numbers.  I'm not sure how many primes there are with
192 or fewer bits, but it's far fewer than 2^384.
There are better techniques around for factoring large numbers than
this sort of brute force testing.  While I didn't follow the thread
very closely, they probably used the quadratic sieve or number field
sieve algorithm.  See Schneier's _Applied_Cryptography_ for more on
factoring, including references to more detailed works.

Date: Wed, 10 Jan 1996 11:26:49 -0500
    From: pcw at access.digex.net (Peter Wayner)
    Many cypherpunks might enjoy programming in XLISP 2.1h because the freely
    available implementation of LISP now offers support for BIGNUMS. That means
    it is quite easy to write cryptographic algorithms that use very large
    numbers without adding extra support. The downside is that the language is
    interpretted and thus much slower than something like C.
This is good to hear.  However it's also worth noting that a number of
other freely available lisps, e.g. CLISP, gcl (previously kcl and
akcl) and CMU Common Lisp, also support bignums.  CMU Common Lisp has
the disadvantage of not being as portable as the others, but has the
advantage of compiling to native code on supported architectures which
include Sparc, Pmax, and HP.
    It should also be possible to write RSA in a very short XLISP program. I
    don't know if you can do 4 lines, but it should be quite short.
Yup.  I've written some code that generates large numbers, tests for
primality and does RSA.  The basic RSA enclode is just (mod-expt m e
n) and decrypt is (mod-expt c d n) where mod-expt is just an optimized
version of (mod (expt x p) n), ala Schneier, page 200 (1st edition).
Even with CLISP (compiles to a byte code which is then interpreted),
I've generated RSA keys in the range that PGP deals with.

    :     : Diversity will be enhanced by having the birds in the U.S., and
    : if left in their native jungles, most will die anyway. Better a
    : pampered tropical bird in a gilded cage than lunch for some

    Aside from the amusing belief that caged life is preferrable, let
    me point out that importation of species can be pretty nasty.
    Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, Mongooses in Hawaii, those nasty
    snakes from Guam ... etc, etc.
Good point.  If you view nature as a market system of survival
capital, trying to seriously alter it rather than just living off of
it is asking for trouble.  This is true for command economy
governments, slash-and-burn farmers, and species importers.  Nature
(the market) will continue, but the meddlers (humans) are risking
their chance to be players.
Two more reasons why the better-diversity-through-cages
is weak:
 - many (most?) species tend not to reproduce in captivity.
 - most illegal imported animals die in transit.
The tropical bird has better odds of survival against the predator and
starvation than it has against smugglers and gilded cage operators.
If you consider the odds of reproducing, they're *much* better with
the predator and starvation than with the smugglers and cagers.
