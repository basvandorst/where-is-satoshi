It takes an inventor's time (thus money) to invent it, you can patent it.
Since these people invented a special test, the testing of that sequence for
mutations, akin to testing metal integrity sonically, patenting it makes
perfect sense.
More sense than patenting mathematical operations at the very least. About
as much sense as many software patents. How much sense we're talking about
here isn't actually relevant, it's international law mixed with so much
money that it's not going to change without a fight.

May I ask what you strive to achieve by specifically stating in your license
This software may not be used for terrorism, paedophilia or crimes
against humanity.
Or are you just trying to make sure that terrorists don't just get killed in
action and/or sentenced to death (mutiple times in some countries) but also
sentenced to whatever is says for breaking an arbitrary user agreement? It's
not like a law, rule or ethic of any kind is going to stop any of those 3,
if it did they wouldn't exist.
We can therefore conclude that you cannot have included it to actually stop
those three. Is it then a statement against those? Sort of a "I do not agree
with (condone) the activities" of those three? Personally I think stating
that you fear this to be used for those things is helping them, some of them
exist only to cause such fear. And why should you poise technological
process with such fear?

At some point you draw a line for yourself. All tech you make can and will
be used in murders, directly or indirectly. If you think denying
a monetary gift as a sacrifice to try and prevent people-killing-research

him build awesome rocket engines, worst he could do is help his country. We
don't blame Turing for his work even though it helps millions of
computer-guided missiles even today.
I'm saying it's okay to develop something you really want to build. Doing
so when you know it'll help in anything unethical, more so than it will
anything ethical, you don't. You can neither stop DARPA from developing
weapons, some really believe what they do is for the good of all, nor can
you prevent progress. Stop trying. Don't do anything unethical. Convince
others to feel about it the same way you do.

I predicted (literally told a friend with 300euro's worth of bitcoins at

sell." after which we discussed whether or not it was a bubble, he didn't
really know, and whether or not the bubble would bubble up even more. Now I
predict the people's refound trust in Bitcoins will cause a new bubble, a
(relatively?) much smaller one though, and that overall the value of
bitcoins will rise quite steadily.

I had a laugh here, though you were talking of the film "A few angry men"
which to me somehow equals "12 angry men". This was somewhat confusing
because (spoiler alert) in that film a boy is nigh executed however because
someone decided to first carefully weigh all the evidence against him, none
of it seemed undeniably true and therefor by the reasoning of "innocent
unless proven otherwise" they couldn't reasonably sent a child off to die.
The same plausible deniability that OTR seems to offer, by making is
possible to falsify perfectly a set of logs it becomes impossible to say
that any log is accurate. You can converse and the text you produce is as
false as it is true. The real life problem isn't with your own logs however,
it the ones that our kind governments (order company's or organisations to)
Repudiation is a word I've never heard of and after slight research it seems
something obvious without reason for discussing it. Simply whether one can
state he didn't do it, when something is "signed" (that's usual term for it)
it is combined with a key supposedly known only to it's "owner",
the likelihood of someone else figuring out what the key was or finding the
key otherwise should be so low that it can be called "certain". At least for
a certain amount of time that suffices for the data at hand, in a war for
example a 90 year decode time[1] is very acceptable and in a financial
transaction valuing 40 dollars 2k worth of electricity isn't worth it[2].
What logically follows from those facts is that "non-repudiation" is present
for a certain amount of time[3] depending on the value of that which is to
be (not) repudiated, no one needs to state otherwise and the result is quite

@_subject: [cryptography] Digital cash in the news... 
I get back from vacation and suddenly my inbox is filled with
While this is supossed to be a fairly technical mailinglist (about
cryptography) it seems clear many people haven't quite understood bitcoins'
Let me break it down:
* With a private/public key combination you can sign a message stating
you're transferring a certain fraction of value (a bitcoin is what we call
the 1 value).
* This message you sent to nodes within the bitcoin network.
* Each node checks whether or not your transaction can be executed and
compiles these correct transactions into a 'block'.
* Each node will try to find a proof-of-work for the block he made. Once he
has it, he can ship the block off towards everywhere (as many as possible
other nodes).
* Recieving nodes will check the block and when they accept it, put a
reference (hash) to it in their next block. The resulting chain of blocks is
called the block 'chain'
Now that the transaction is solidified in a block one can proof he has some
amount of money, by referencing a payment to him in the block.
How do the first bitcoins enter the system? By making a block one gets an
award. The amount given per award is getting steadily lower. If you're
thinking you can get rich quick by letting your computer solve blocks, think
again! There's only one block to be solved every ten minutes, if it goes to
fast the blocks will get harder, and there's a lot of people trying to solve
it, you're electricity will likely cost you more than solving blocks is
going to earn you. You're welcome to try though, solving a block makes
transactions happen.
What will happen when the awards are nearly gone? Then the total amount of
bitcoins will stay nearly the same. This'll happen after quite some years.
The total amount will be nearly 21 million bitcoins. The transactions will
be paid for by bounty set on every transaction. As long as someone is
willing to make the proof-of-work your transaction will end up in the block
chain and be made permanent.
That is basically the system. The whole
whitepaperisn't long or hard to
understand and I highly suggest reading it.
I know of only two (not dealbreaking) issues:
1. Transactions take time to happen (they are non-instant) (bank
transactions are much worse though).
2. Because of the deflation all coins gotten earlier were easier to get and
are now "worth" as much a block gotten now. I prefer deflation over
inflation and if this really takes of the earliest of adaptors really
deserved the money.
On the (geo)economical side I think this is the best that every happend to
the world. The bitcoin is quite violent right now, because there's still so
little value being traded with them. But that will sort out and after that
it'll just keep on getting more stable. "Regular" currency's (dollars,
euro's, yen, whatever) are only as stable as their backing organisations or
resource. Anything that goes up has got to fall, and bitcoins aren't
anything, not even air! Trade has always been based on "when I give you
this, what can I do with what you give me back?" and so, when people accept
a certain amount of bitcoins for something, bitcoins have use and thus
There is a wonderfull elegance in something we can trade at no costs,
without any ability to cheat or adversely manipulate it's amount. Even
without saying who (exactly) we are!
It's propable that when you swap something as elementary as our
not-wonderfull money with this it'll give some turbulance. And as with
anything new, especially when it gives true freedom, people will get their
panty's all up in a bunch. Usually their arguments either rest on not
understanding what's going on, or claiming that this gives a security issue.
The first argument I'll always counter with knowledge and logic. For the
second argument I'd like to parphrase Benjamin Franklin: "He who sacrifices
essential freedom for safety, deserve neither.". Surely being able to own
and transfer what you own is an essential  freedom.
I'd prefer not going into political conversation on here but I think it far
too interesting not to have it at all.

The system is quite "self healing" in that once any attack is over, the
scraps will be quite efficiently picked up and woven into new fabric again.
No money can be "spawned" in the system, anything adverse that slipped into
the block chain will be sorted out after.
The expense of changing a transaction increases over time, if you want to be
sure of a transaction: wait it out. Up to a point that reverting the
transaction would hold no profit. That said it's relatively hard
to organize such an attack and it would most likely leave large traces.

It is possible for any current governmental agency to hijack the entire
system, due to their access to supercomputer infrastructures and/or immense
budgets. This will however become less and less possible while bitcoin
continues to grow and is already a massive and technological challenge which
I do not see any governmental institutions execute proper.
It is also strange to say these transactions are "untraceable". Nothing is
less true. Governments have complete transcripts of all sent data (USA, GB
and AUS have a neat little system for this set up, catch all emails too),
and every transaction is signed by the money's owner, it needs to be
processed. Sure one could create many different unique signatures (bitcoin
adresses) but those could all be traced moving out of the house. It's just
immensely more tedious to do than tracking, say, bank transactions and so
many agencies will just not be technical enough to do this.
Funny enough the same internet security things will help as with all
internet things Tor on your neighbors network with IPSEC and SSL "behind 7
proxy's". (even then the network will need to process your transactions and
agencies can just follow along with that, they just can't really trace the
transactions back to you; if you use different bitcoin adresses)

When I first heard Steve died I thought people were joking. I figured he
resigned from Apple but he'd stick around for another few years, like Bill's
around although he resigned. I was wrong. I actually had the world slowing
down feeling. Realizing I'd never have a discussion about the early years of
the computer industry and where it's going with an aged Steve and Bill. I
simply thought it was unlikely I'd ever be important enough to get that
conversation, but now it's impossible . He's been such a role model of how a
solid presentation should be given. The image Apple has gained under his
leadership is sheer cunning. I wish I knew how responsible he was for it, so
I could credit him accordingly.
I like to think it was all him. It's times like these that time's
passing disturbs me most. That I wish for an afterlife so that nothing is

All non-windows OS's are less likely targets due to a lower market share.
Linux has complete rights management, although using it properly is the
user's (or his/her root's) responsibility. Mac has a good reputation but I'm
not an expert on it.
What's even better is chrome/chromium OS. Don't install anything, browser
only. No place to install spyware.

These people took a known minor problem and blew it up to destroy the whole
economy. The sheer amount of assumptions alone makes it hard to call it a
paper, that and the lack of proper structure (or references).
For the sake of argument (short version: I don't think botnets can
reasonably USE that much power and even than it wouldn't likely break the

sad Americans who ended up with more gaming power than they'd ever wish
for. The FPGA's will likely work out all GPU mining in the short run. The
kind of people that would have a high performance videocard are not those
that don't notice when a huge chunk of their system is being used. No one
puts an FPGA to their system that can accelerate Bitcoin mining for any
other reason than to actually do so. That doesn't change the fact that, to
a botnet operator, it'd still be profitable to mine with botnets. But it
drives down their impact on the hashrate drastically.
They assume there is and will be a practically infinite amount of computers
in a botnet. I'd say there's a damn lot. To say that there will be enough
operators willing to risk their machines (Bitcoin mining heats the computer
and slows it down, those two things people understand as "something's
wrong") for the hashrate to become filled with botnets alone is quite a

(or will be) higher than the rate at which they're mined. Using the
Bitcoins legitmately effectively legitimizes them, the "paper" claims that
the police forces wouldn't understand it so that fact doesn't matter.
Usually a lack of arguments makes me feel like no conclusions have been
reached, only speculation performed, but let's give a counter argument:
valid and fair (not legal per sC)) use of bitcoins is far more visible than
the mining process (something that is easily misunderstood) .
Botnet operators would be wise to point their systems at mining pools, as
they turn out the majority of profit made and the political power over the
network will be donated to legitimate pool owners. Some operators won't,
and that will spread control over the network.

Bitcoin banks (perhaps with their own pools) can mitigate any trouble of
this kind. It might require some implementation details and would likely
ruin a part of Bitcoins elegance, but it could work.
I'll admit though, to one claim of theirs: if the network becomes mostly
criminal, it will fall.

I will invest my time and skill to improve the people's knowledge
and sovereignty. For the sake of brevity I will omit my reasons to do so.
I find that in a capitalist society everything starts with money. Anything
will have finances in it's foundation. If we are to create anything pure,
elegant and satisfying we've can't have shaky foundations; we can't have
bad money. Improving money will improve everything.
Whether or not Bitcoins can do it, I can't be sure. I think it has the
potential to. What better way to spend our time than to try and make it so?
Thank you for the e-mail iang. I very much appreciate it.

I guess it's a proof of concept kind of thing. Stating there is such a
thing as a unique writing style, even an identifiable one.  Now further
research can be done to actually make it work.

How do we earn the moron's cash? Put kindly the duplication of brand names
will create confusion among non-technical users and from that confusion
will result a loss of income.
Besides why would I want google.com to lead elsewhere than what I expect it
to? Do I want to have to go through a DNS(-ish?) config procedure when I
want to show nyan cat at my friends house? What else than a unique name do
you want, 20Q? Good luck getting free from "slimy thugs".
Naturally we could don the DNS system and use onion-id style identifiers.
Good luck making the usability plea on that one. "Don't worry Google can
find it for you"? Not to mention we can already use IPv4/6 addresses
without DNS. Why don't you?
The only thing that really fucking frustrates me is the requirement of
"."'s in the name. Why not just accept any string as an ID? Why does Google
have to register Google.[com|org|net|nl|co.uk|be|sp|hu|etc.]? Why not just
"google" or "google"? Tie it right in with the brand-name protection stuff
we've got going on. They should've done that from the beginning. You
register your company, you get a unique address. Strip the "Inc", "AG",
"BV" and stick to the company name. There is some cross-business-type
problems, fix them by either appending a ".accounting" or by changing
names. Allow people to register addresses but override them if a business
comes in the way.
Why didn't they do it? Politics, man.
Seriously though, we should figure out a way of splitting the
responsibility for who gets what address. ICANN is now screwing that
bigtime by spamming gTLD's. Maybe we'll abandon them completely in the
future. I suspect the switch'll be quite painful.

really suck. Maybe they'd have the means to go after them but I likely
wouldn't have.

some really cool DNS providers integrating .bit to standard resolves
though, I'd like to see more of that)

SEPA and bank transfers are (sometimes) also easily reversable. Paypal has
a policy against virtual currencies, after a quantity of bitcoin-related
paypal accounts had been closed people stopped using it. Wisely so, Paypal
has strange account-freezing policies.
You may still get a Paypal to Bitcoin exchange in a person-to-person trade
though, ask around. Bitcoin OTC can give you an indication of
someone's trustworthiness.

I don't think there's enough incentive to spend Prestigecoins. I don't
get anything in return. The idea of mined Prestigecoin and normal
Presigecoin eiter splits the currency or is moot. Since I can give
myself or a fake account of mine coins the laundring of coins is
either very easy, or impossible. If it's impossible then what would a

It's hard to convince people that money should be decentralised, but
it'll be even harder to convince them that giving likeing should be
decentralised. If you think you solve some sort of quantification or
fake person problem you are wrong.
It's either important that something earns you money or that something
is really good, or both. Doing something just for the prestige of it
is pretentious and it'll prevent you from doing what you truly believe
in. After all who can judge your work better than the expert who's
opinion you respect or yourself? Having a currency prestige system is
not going to help anyone but those already popular, those who least
need it. It's also not an uncommon problem to see wel solved in a
centralised manner.
What drives you to want to engage in this project?
