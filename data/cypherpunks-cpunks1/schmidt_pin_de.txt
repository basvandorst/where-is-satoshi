@_subject: Jurisdictionless Distributed Data Havens 
Some annotations:
1. The easiest way to make such a distributeted data havens (DDH)
would be to use a distributed unix file system that
doesn't distribute files but chunks of bytes. (Striping)
Advantage: - All normal services would work: ftp,http,...
- Copying, deleting and modifing files.
- Easy to install and use.
Because each side can supply all data (collecting on
the fly from other DDHs), the site holder
could be responsible for the data.
This could be prevented by collecting and
assembling data at the client side (e.g. using
2. When the DDHs are distributed around the world in
a lot of different states, it could be very
difficult for any government to get any evidence for
"illegal" data on one site.

I'm talking about this link (you mentioned earlier).
Maybe I can translate it (or I can summarize it).

Definetly not.
There is an advisory from the Generalbundesanwaltschaft and
the ICTF that ISPs should ('have to') restrict the access to
those urls.
But so far nothing happend. I asked some people
to try the urls and there where no restrictions.
(I encounterd no restrictions myself.)

There is an advisory around where the ISPs say that
they think it's not possible to block urls.
And even if they figure a way out to do this,
this mailing list proves (mirrors) that it's not
possible to stop the flow of information.
But the German Government doesn't seem to even
understand a bit how the inet works.
The Germans. I don't like this evil German bashing.
(which is quite obvios in some mails, although I
think not in this one, but I had to say this)
Some of us (some may say most, I'm not) are quite normal and
there are even some cypherpunks around :)
And as there are lots of ISPs in Germany (as in every
other country) they won't get everyone to resctrict the access
to some pages.

Agreed :)
I talked to someone about censorship here in Germany
and we both think there is not much around.
Germans are always amused when american film stars come
to a German tv show and ask if they can use words like
fuck on tv. Or the beeps in some songs on mtv Europe.
The only big 'censorship' in Germany concerns
extrem left and right wing texts etc
(e.g. 'Ausschwitzluege', which is, when someone says
ausschwitz is a lie), because it's
illegal to distribute such things.
And some censorship is involved in selling video games,
although the concept is often misunderstood in the US. Video Games are not censored and can be bought by adults. It's only prohibited to sell these things to kids.
And to this 'Herr Schmidt': most of the people I know
are amused about 'Anglos' using this Herr XXX (say on skyone, nbc, etc.) stuff, because
no German uses this phrase in this way :)
And I thought cypherpunks are more open,
concerning some mails I received.
I think I had to say this, so don't bother.
PS: and to those who mailed : it`s stephan not stephen ;)

Sorry for my bad English, perhaps I got misunderstood.
Would you run a WWW site where the (say there where some)
terrorist who shot down (a wild assumtion too) the TWA plane
claiming it was right and all people should fight 'evil
America'. Because of your web site there are other bomb
attacks in the US (or somewhere else, the country is not that important) (although it's of course impossible to proove that
this bombings are 'inspired' by your web site).
Would you support the freedom of speech in this way ?
And to those who misunderstood my posting:
a. I support the freedom of speech.
b. I'm not shure I can support freedom of speech
in ALL circumstances.
c. I wanted to know what other people in this mailing
list thought. Would they support freedom of speech
for everyone ? Under all circumstances ?
(I hope you got my point of view now)
d. I think (hope) I'm a cypherpunk.
e. Don't mistake my opinion with the opinion of
the German Government, which I tried to
make clear (I would be the last
to support the German Government.)

Perhaps you call a spade an axe.
To all those who haven't got the point:
a. Im antifa.
b. It's easy to say things when noone can get you.
It's harder to say the truth in the face of a skin
with a baseball racket.
c. I hope I get not killed for this :)

Perhaps my connection is only disrupted accidently, but
I can't access  from one account
(the two others still work).
IP tried : 194.109.6.100
SPG: What is the 'new' IP ?
(I hope you don't think I'm a spy for
the German Government :)
Perhaps this time we have to proove that it's impossible to block an IP/Web site, so that all govs
get a clue about who inet works.
Hmm, some may claim it's better that the
goverment thinks they sucessfully restricted
the access to those pages.
I think they should know what they can't do.

The numbers are rotating every hour, so i can send you a the ip-number every hour to trace to :)

i think they have already or will be informed by
the ICTF in some day's. Look at:

The German Company MobilCom wants to proove

There have been rumors that it's possible to
phone with a hacked code.
If a hacker is able to phone using the number
0171 / 3 28 99 66 in Germany with a hacked code,
the company will pay 100.000 DM (~65.000$) to a non
profit organisation of the hackers choice.
Is someone able to do this ? :)

^^^^^^^^^
ICTF members blocked the site. (?) (Non-members didn't block it.)
They brought one server down, which they didn't like.
So 'they' think, they won. That's the only important thing.
Hmm. Did they stop blocking the ip ? I have access.
