may the light always find you on a dreary day.
i love her style. time for a new spring look...
soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?). i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
i want those red boots and that coat. simple is always prettiest to me. with the sun streaming in
have you seen april's ms living yet? (i hate in quilting and knitting and sewing when the designs get all fancy just because they can). in a tiny town in idaho
i am looking forward to a date with grant.
may you always have courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your underpants.
i love the comments i get from all of you. ok, i'm off to knit...
haha, that's my girl. it was super delicious. here's an irish blessing from us to you...
