hi ray.
can ya do me a favor?
Tell the fine folks on Cypher Punks that I will be handing out disks at UNIX expo, I have 100 3.5" 1.44 mb floppies and a ready to compile version of PGP- Plus a copy of the cypto articles you gave me last time. If anyone has ready to run (i.e. pkgadd, or tar -xvf pgp ) versions of PGP for SUN, SCO AIX, linux or some other UNIX drop me a line. I hope to
have both source and ready to run disks. (And some PC disks as well)
If you live in the NYC area, and want to go to UNIX-Expo for free (I have
two extra passes, First come First Served) or just want to help- send
mail to sal at panix.com

Ohhh-God, not again...
Can anyone remember the Prodigy rumor? How IBM was snooping around
your hard disk, and it turned out to be nothing but a swapfile. Does
"Good times" ring a bell? And don't get me started on MicroSoft Network rumors...
1) 90% of the FTP sites I use mention that they log xfers.
2) My .newsrc file can tell anyone that I read alt.hackers and alt.2600
3) My address book shows who I send mail often enough to warrent me
   putting in a nickname.
4) My sent-mail folder shows who I sent mail to in the past year.
5) My bookmark file shows that I read the NYC-Speedtraps page one or
   two time a week.
I am sure that AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe and Acme Internet all log what mail/news/web pages/ftp sites you have visited, in one way or another.
Does this bother me? A little. I use a local Internet provider with
an OS I understand enough to know what is logged and what is not logged.
My fear is not LEA, but crackers. As long as I make myself a hard
target- they vultures will look elseware. I repeat this like a mantra yet no one belives me- IF YOU WANT PRIVACY, DON'T USE THE PHONE. Once the headset is raised, big brother is online. If you do not like those
rules, don't play the game.

Why not write a shell script to decrypt you .newsrc, run your
reader then re-encrypt the .newsrc file ?
Why not do that for you mail address book file as well ?
Hey, this is cypher-punks- DIY :)

If you can't see the tables, how do you know the games aren't rigged?
And do they offer Wayne Newton over streaming Video? What about free

Caught between Iraq and a hard-one?
Perhaps would should allow our elected officials to keep concubines. After all, no man is going to end the world on a crappy Monday morning if there a chance of getting some that night. I'm willing to bet that the money used to launch one cruise missile could support keeping a group of well funded presidential concubines around for the duration of his eight year presidency.

I read it. After a while I noticed that I had a lot in common with
the young programmer that she had an affair with. It took a while to come to terms with being a "type" :)
There were two things about the book that I disliked:
1) Macho-computing. A number of consultants tend to act as if they are
   sliting the atom or landing a man on the moon as they work. While I
   agree that programming is hard work, and that a lot of what programmers
   do is on the edge, it is hardly ground breaking to implement YA DBMS,
   even if it is Java based and web-centric.
2) I think she was tring to hard to look technical.  sal at panix.com                                       Salvatore Denaro
