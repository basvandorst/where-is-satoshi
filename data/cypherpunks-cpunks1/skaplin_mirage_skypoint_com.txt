I just had an interesting conversation with a person who works for an ISP.
Basically their response if S.314 becomes law will be to preprocess all
incoming mail. If it is uuencoded or encrypted, into the bit bucket it will
go. They are still thinking about what to do with telnet and ftp.
This is starting to get very scary.

The problem is that providers will be responsible for all traffic coming in
and going out of their system. This includes usenet. I would imagine that
the same filters would be applied to news too.
I think we need to start lobbying now. I find it amazing that CPR and EFF

I too thought it was a spoof initally. Hell, what Senator would be dumb enough to name a bill this way if it was real. If I were trying to pass a bill of this nature, it would be double-speak all of the way. But alas it is true...And I thought the DT bill was bad. Both of my congresscritters have been faxed and queried as to their position. I'll inform the group when they fax me back. I would urge others to do this.

Last I heard, the Supreme Court had never made a ruling on this. They copped out and left it up to "Community Standards." This is partially why the AA bbs case was sucessfuly prosecuted in another state.
Under the new legislation, might this not be illegal? ;)
On another note, I mailed Stanton McClandish to find out what EFF's position is on this. I tried browsing their archives, but lots of stuff seems to have vanished from there.

The question is: What is obsene? What the community in NYC considers obsene is sure a lot different than what the community in Elk River Minnesota considers obsene. (They've been trying to eject their one XXX bookstore for years now while NYC has the American Museum of Pornography at 42nd Street ;) ;) :) ) As you can see, obsenity depends where you are geographically located, at least according to our highest court. If community standards say it is obsene then it is. They never legally defined what constitutes something as being obsene or an obsenity.

There are going to be a lot of factions involved with this one. Some

(Command, Control and Communications) to this. Set up a forum for
coordinating efforts, delegate tasks, most important communicate so we
don't waste resources on redundant efforts. The religious right has
successfully been doing this for years. Perhaps a dose of their own medicine

EPIC field someone with better debating skills? A sellout was offered a la EFF and DT. Mr. Rotenberg seemed ill prepared and not really interested in the issue. This is not a good omen. The perseption left in my non-internet literate wife was that the INTERNET=smut. :(

I don't think paranoia has anything to do with it. I just expect people to
do the job that they are supposed to do. IMHO Mr. Rotenberg didn't do his
job as well as he should have. I saw numerous opportunities to score salient
points and he didn't. What Senator Exon says and what the bill says are two
different things. I got the feeling that Senator Exon didn't even understand
the ramifications of the bill. The unfortunate part is Joe Blow on the
street isn't going to read the bill. He's going to rely on what he has
heard. In my opinion Mr. Rottenberg didn't correct Senator Exon forcefully
enough. The consumate politician triumphed.

*Anarchy, Chaos on the Internet Must End* Martha S. Siegel
   Elections are over, and, for better or worse, recognized
leadership is installed and working in most places.  Yet, in
Cyberspace, the electronic world dominated by the much vaunted
Internet, there is not much order.  This huge international
computer web tying together about 30 million people is governed
by no one.
   What an amazing state of affairs.  The most powerful commu-
nication medium ever invented is being left to the equivalent of
mob rule.  Last year was the year of the Internet in the media.
Clearly it is now in the mainstream.  Nonetheless, judging by
what you read or hear, the key question of who runs it is not
even an issue.  It is more fun, after all, to contemplate
shopping in an electronic mall or how to order a pizza through a
   No matter, if you scratch the surface of this big, happy
party, the need for firm direction is all too obvious.  Also
reported in the press is an expanding array of Internet
problems.  Unregulated broadcasting of sexually explicit
material that is readily available to children usually heads the
list, but on-line sexual harassment, profanity, defamation,
forgery and fraud run close seconds.
   The secretiveness that computer communications allows is a
special reason why abuse is easy.  National and personal
security are serious considerations when anyone can, with
complete anonymity, send encrypted information worldwide via the
Internet.  Such problems are further exacerbated by a computer
in Finland called the Anonymous Server, which exists for the
sole purpose of laundering computer messages, much like dirty
money is laundered through small island nations.  Consequently,
if you want to, say, threaten someone with death, your risk of
retribution is small, courtesy of the Anonymous Server.
   Nowhere are Cyberspace difficulties more evident than in the
inevitable swing toward Internet commercialization.  The widely
reported turf war rages onbetween academic factions that
controlled Internet before it went public and business newcomers
who now want to access its huge audience.  Electronic attacks on
business people by means ranging from computer insults, called
flames, to assorted forms of electronic vandalism, persist
uncontrolled.  Worst of all are the "canceller robots," computer
programs meant to erase the communications of anyone the hackers
who usually launch them want to silence.
   These self-styled vigilantes routinely challenge free speech
in Cyberspace unabated.  Internet access providers, companies
that connect people to the Internet for a profit, likewise
assume the role of censors, arbitrarily closing accounts of
those whom they disapprove.
   Given its international nature, one obvious way to bring much
needed order to the Internet is through diplomacy.  The United
States should lead in this.  A good beginning might be to urge
the Finnish government to deactivate the Anonymous Server.
Diplomacy could also help to establish an international standard
of recognizing laws existing at the point of origin as
controlling the message sender.
   When conflicts arise, governmental diplomacy should again be
the answer, just as it is with other trade and communications
issues.  Next, laws already regulating behavior in the real
world should be applied to Cyberspace.  This is already taking
place on a case-by-case basi, but the process is too slow.  The
Supreme Court should act to create a precedent stating that
crime is crime, even when the criminal instrument is a computer
   In the United States, legislation should be passed making
Internet providers common carriers.  This will get them out of
the business of censorship and under the guiding hand of the
Federal Communications Commission.
   People need safety and order in Cyberspace just as they do in
their homes and on the streets.  The current state of the
Internet makes it clear that anarchy isn't working.  If
recognized governments don't find a way to bring order to the
growing and changing Internet, chaos may soon dictate that the
party is over.

Perhaps it is two unrelated events. Maybe the Russians are using GPS in
their attack on Chechnya, and the administration decided "Not on our dime."
The call up could possibly be related to the repatriacion of the Hatian
boat people or even a continued presence in Hatii. I think Atistede still
needs lots of proping up. The Ton-Ton Macoutes, from Baby Doc and Papa
Doc's dictatorship were the police and military of the previous one. They
just vanished into the population. Its almost the perfect guerilla force,
just the thing the berets are into. This would be much more likely if the
individual was of African decent. From what I have heard, prior to any
military action in Hatii, we had a sizable force of Special Forces, Green
Berets and other elete troops in place. Most of them were black. This was
because they blended in with the populace. Perhaps the forces on the ground
needed to be rotated and personnel came up short. I don't know...but if it
is anything we, should find out real soon.
Manditory crypto thought...I wonder if the government has taken any steps
to prevent the INTERNET from being used for C3 functions, like it was used
during the gulf war by Iraq. (I know...I know...pretty weak, but the
communications has to have been encrypted. :) )

I hope they took you someplace nice for lunch...You might want to file a
FOI request on yourself, just to see how much they censor. ;) They might
think you're the ringleader, after all the FBI doesn't buy peons lunch. ;)

Fill out this form letter, get it notarized and send it to the address in
the letterhead. Be prepared to wait and get jerked around. I have heard
that some FOI requests have taken as long as two years to get back.

deletions, I ask that each deletion be marked to indicate the
exemption(s) being claimed to authorize each particular withholding.
In addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release
any records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding
serves no important public interest.
I hereby agree to pay reasonable costs associated with this request up

I just read that the remailer at jpunix.com went down suddenly and
permanently. Anyone know what happened?? I also believe the whole site is
down as it didn't answer my pings a couple of days ago.

@_subject: Remailer In a Box available for beta testing 
One minor question, is it possible to set it up so that it is not a final
hop remailer. In other words the remailer is set up to pass its mail on to
another remailer which is the final destination (preferably non-U.S.) If
so, I'm in. I've already got my account on c2 doing three things, what's
one more. If we could make this possible, it could really propagate
remailers as it removes some of the liability from those who can't afford
I would love to run a final hop remailer, unfortunately financially I
barely have enough cash to keep on the net, let alone pay for a lawyer if
needed. Hopefully this is only temporary, (wifey finally found a job, now
it's catch-up time) but I'm unfortunately getting used to it.

Hi Lance,
I just set up a remailer at syrinx at c2.org. I think I remember that you were
somehow generating background noise for the remailers to minimize traffic
analysis could you please provide me with details?

I just had CNN on for background noise. They did a one minute piece on a new threat to the internet. HACKERS. Bizdos for some reason was on it and they went slightly into why transmitting credit card numbers as plain text was stupid. Their estimate is that encryption is at least five years away. Just amazing... BTW- they recommended that everyone install routers to hinder hackers. Check it out...it was on headline news so it probably will be repeated every half hour.

Is this the poem, Lucky?
     They [Nazis] came first for the Communists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.
     Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
     Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.
     Then they came for me,
and by that time there was no one left to speak up.

        PRESS RELEASE
        -------------
    Police and members of Scientology church enter offices of XS4ALL
    ================================================================
Amsterdam - thuesday september 5, 1995.
Today at about 14:00, XS4ALL was visited by Mr. S. Braan,
bailiff. He was acting on behalf of the Religious
Technology Centre, better known as the Scientology Church, or
Scientology for short. He was assisted by a local police officer and Mr.
Hermans from the 'Nauta-Dutilh' legal firm that represents Scientology
in The Netherlands. Also present were two computer experts (Mr. Ootjes
and Mr. Van Suchtelen) a locksmith (to enter had we not been present) and
two American employees of Scientology, Mr. Weightman and Ms. Jenssen.
Scientology is filing for seizure of XS4ALL's computer equipment. Under
dutch law, this means that a bailiff comes in to record your assets. In
real-life, the computer-experts that were present have recorded the
types and serial numbers of all the computers in our offices. They did
not take any equipment, the continuity of XS4ALL's services is not in
What is this all about?
XS4ALL categorically denies any responsability for contents of users'
homepages. The users decide for themselves what is on their homepage.
Since XS4ALL does not edit the homepages and has no mechanism of
control over the contents we strongly feel that the users themselves are
responsible for what they say on their homepage.
This whole affair demonstrates the need for clarity concerning the legal
postion of Internet Providers. We are shocked that our offices can be
invaded bij freshly flown-in U.S. cult members. If we as Internet
providers are held responsible for what our users say, that will
undoubtebly kill freedom of speech on the net.
XS4ALL is not alone in receiving this kind of attention from
Scientology. Scientology, a semi-religious multinational, is at war with
a number of people on the Internet. A non-organized group of people on
the net has started to openly discuss the activities of the church.
Until recently, the church has always managed to supress critical voices
by means of sheer intimidation and by engaging in endless legal battle.
One of the people that Scientology has a problem with is 'fonss', an
XS4ALL user that publishes the F.A.C.T.-net Kit on his home page
( This kit (which can be found on numerous
homepages all over the Internet) consists of a large number of documents
that show the true face of Scientology.
One of these documents is a piece to which Scientology supposedly holds
the copyright and which has been added to the kit without the church's
