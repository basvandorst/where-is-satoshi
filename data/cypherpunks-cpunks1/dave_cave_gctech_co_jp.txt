@_subject: US supporting dissidents? (was Re: Rogue Governments Issuing Policy Tokens) 
I don't think it has to do with complacency.  US support for "dissidents and
revolutionaries" was definitely not based on revolutionaryism, nor on
"cold-war" policy support for democracy, as Noam Chomsky likes to drill into
our heads over and over.
I know that Intel has succeeded in forcing the "Linux Inside" logo and stickers
off the net on threats of trademark infringement suits.  I have a feeling "Big
Brother Inside" would make them even more upset.

Perl 5.0 has a better, simpler, safety mode than Java (and probably Safe-TCL
too), and runs on more machines.  It is also the standard for CGI, so anyone
already running CGI could simply add a perl-based crypto service.
