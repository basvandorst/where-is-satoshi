@_subject: [INFO] Keep tuned: Script-Kiddie and ilk against Frog 
(No doubt some innocent schmuck who made the mistake of sending to
Frog/Frog2 without chaining first.)
Why fret over TLAs,folks? We have our own internal law enforcement:
Sheriff Frog-Admin.
Frog-Admin protects only himself. He has a resolute intolerance of
unpopular speech. He cannot tolerate the very thing a remailer is
meant to protect!
In contrast, I urge you to read the words of a trustworthy and
honorable remop, Randseed Admin Len Sassaman:
Frog-Admin, Your arrogance will be your downfall. I take comfort in
knowing that.
(who now will be added to Frog-Admin's "short-list"
if I'm not on it already)
