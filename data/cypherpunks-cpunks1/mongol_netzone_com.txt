Hmm, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there already a method to bypass the NIC registration fee?  I thought one could use the international method for addressing.  You know, something like *.phx.az.us (for a site in Phoenix, Arizona, United States).  As far as I know, there isn't the fee that is charged for non location-based addressing.  (Although, I'd rather have a regular address)
