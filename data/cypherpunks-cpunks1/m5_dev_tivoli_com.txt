If you do step 1, then step 2 is impossible.  If your application is
constructed such that a non-export-approvable cryptosystem can be
dropped on top, then you will not get export approval.  (I know this
from our direct experience here.)

No, they can't *ban* it, but there's no reason to suspect that they
won't revoke the export license after the scheme becomes clear.  And
of course the patch itself would not be exportable.  If there's a
"wink wink nudge nudge" implication that the patch would make its way
overseas, I don't understand why that's really any more likely than
the US-only version getting out.
Note that the USGov puts definite explicit heat on corporations to
make it clear that they're serious about this stuff.  The responsible
VP for such things at one company with which I'm familiar was
explicitly reminded that he could personally be held criminally liable
for any transgressions of the export laws.

I am forced to wonder whether the people who type in stories like this

"pistols" in the above paragraph; it doesn't make any sense unless you
assume there are no organized crime or terrorist organizations in the

through national borders.  Are news editors so technophobic that they
assume there must be something they just "don't get"?

Another vaguely-related concept is that of tenants' rights to a degree
of security in rental property.
My employer owns the workstation in front of me, but in exchange for
supplying them with software and ideas (when I'm not busy sending
e-mail to mailing lists ;-) they've "given" it to me to use in that
pursuit.  They could of course insist that I pay for it, like the old
company store model that railroad workers dealt with.  In a sense I
do pay for it, under the idea that the company would be able to pay me
more if not for the expense of the tools I need for the job.
Though the ownership==control equation works sometimes, and is
appealing to reason, I don't think things are always so simple.

And still this reminds me of tenants property rights.  (And I do agree
the connection is rather thin, but work with me here.)  An apartment
manager can get in to an apartment for a variety of contractually set
Maybe what all this means is that, at some point, employees will begin
demanding explicit contracts w.r.t. computer system policies, just
like for basic stuff like salaries & benefits.  Indeed, I know of
several cases where engineers being courted demanded and got perks
like window offices or an extra few PTO days in their initial offer;
why not a contract for what is and isn't "mine" on the network?
(In that light, it'd probably develop that those without such a
contract would be left on poor legal ground.)

Gee, why did it take a squad of codebreakers to come to the conclusion
that the Soviets sought to steal atomic secrets?  I mean, couldn't
they just kinda scratch their heads and decide it was highly unlikely
that the Soviets *wouldn't* do it?  And why would they need to "crack"

The only way to achieve the level of security offered by physical face
to face communication with a person is to have a physical face to face
conversation at some point.  If you only ever communicate via
electronic means, you are always subject to the risk of dealing with a
synthetic entity.  (I think.)

That's not clear.  I can have confidence when using a PK scheme that I
am at least communicating securely with the entity that holds the
private key.  That that entity may be leaking information through
alternate channels is something I don't know; I don't see how you can
securely defend against that in any case, or perhaps I don't see how
defending against it in the case that you think you know who you're
dealing with is any different than defending against it if you accept
that you don't know who you're dealing with.

If we exchange keys on a face-to-face basis, then I really don't see
much of a MITM threat, unless somehow the MITM has perverted my
original key and I for some reason can't figure that out.  Now, as
long as you communicate with me via the public key I've handed you, we
should be as safe as PKE can make us.
If we are forced to exchange keys remotely, then perhaps some sort of
"proof" techniques could be used to establish to some level of
assurance that the remote entity I *think* is you is really you.  Or
you could provide me with a key, and then I could poll a list of
references to inquire as to the "goodness" of the key.  This seems to
me to be subtly different than a certificate procedure, because I'm
not asking about the goodness of a relationship to the key, but rather
about the key itself.
Maybe I'm missing something.  What is there to trust in a more
"traditional" certificate scheme?

You have several alternative means of verifying the key:
1) You can meet Bob at a local Pizza Hut and verify the key in person.
2) You can go through a variety of channels to a variety of other
trusted entities and verify with them that they're using the same key

But if by all means available Bob and Alice satisfy themselves that

What, however, is the real difference between the MITM scenario in a
purely electronic relationship, and a "phony personality in the
middle" attack on a "flesh" relationship?  You *think* you're working
with a realtor to buy a house, but in fact it's a con artist that

you for sex.  There are no guarantees.
Let me ask this:  how do you *guarantee* that you're having a truly
private in-the-flesh correspondence with a person?  And, having done
that, how do you *guarantee* that the other person will behave in an
absolutely trustworthy fashion?

Oh now wait a sec here; I don't think anybody's advocated using
"untested" keys.  It's still perfectly reasonable to establish
networks of reliable information focused on a key.
If I electronically "encounter" Alice and decide to begin a secure
conversation, we initiate a key exchange.  I can then go to as many
already-trusted entities as I like in an attempt to verify that as
many attributes that are claimed to be associated with the key are
really there as I desire.  If Alice wants to buy a widget from me, I
can ask other businesses whether they've ever had problems collecting
from that key.  If I want to buy a widget from Alice, I can ask
friends whether they've gotten good widget from that key.  If I'm
interested in a little e-hanky-panky, I can ask around the sleazier
corners of the net to see whether Alice is the kiss-and-post type.
Somebody's going to have to explain to my thick skull how it is that a
certificate system makes this process any different, fundamentally.  I
mean, it may be that there's more superficial security, but I don't
see where there's any additional risk truly introduced by using the
key itself as a "True Name".  Maybe the real question is, how does a
certificate system give me the confidence that there really is an
"Alice" according to some definition of "really" that satisfies me?

Hal said this same thing in a recent note.  For myself, I've never
meant to argue that the MITM threat is unimportant.  I've simply
contended that you're no more vulnerable to it in the key-as-True-Name
scenario than with a certificate-bound key-to-name relationship
system.  If you assume an MITM could thwart the establishment of trust
in the first case, then I guess I posit that the same energies could
with equivalent hope for success be directed in an attack on a more
"traditional" certificate scheme.

And this is where I start to think we're all in agreement even though
there's an argument going on!  Yes, I think you need to protect
against MITM attacks by whatever means are available.  I think that no
matter what you do, if you're strictly relying on communications
systems over which you ultimately have no control (if at some point
somebody you simply have to trust on faith inevitably gets his hands
on your bits), then you have to put up with a non-zero probability of
being victimized by a MITM attack.  If you're willing on blind faith
to trust certificates granted by some authority, you're fooling
yourself (I claim).  If you only trust that authority because it fits
into an established web, then I don't see why there's any need for a
certificate binding a public key to some "True Name" constant; what's
the point?  (How do you know the alleged True Name has any meaning in
the first place?)
I also posit that this is not really any different than the problems
of social interaction homo sapiens have been dealing with ever since
they grunted their way into cooperative tribal life.

Maybe I'm not sure what good a "true name" certificate is going to do
me in establishing confidence in a key.  How will I know that the

or devious paths through "safe" features) and attacks based on
relatively wild hypothetical speculation?  I mean, just about all of
the "attacks" in this note could just as well be applied to any
software at all that you might choose to run on your machine.  Indeed,
I'd say that Java applets are probably a lot *safer* than an arbitrary

with (the AWT or whatever class libraries the browser makes available,
which could be quite limited).

> > > ACK ACK
 > > ACK

 > ACK
I've just kinda been watching this debate for a while, so I may well
have missed some of the more interesting details; if so, I apologize
for my noise in advance.
I work on a lot of commercial software under constraints of
scalability much like the SSL "attack server" being discussed here.
My instincts tell me that in this situation the whole process would be
*much* simpler if the basic idea of keeping the central server (or
the family of distributed servers in those models) completely
"informed" by all the attacking clients were abandoned.
Tim May's "random attack" idea was extremely attractive, I thought.
However, I think that it'd be possible to take advantage of the fact
that the keyspace itself is basically constant (until the keysize is
increased in the protocol under attack, of course).  I mean, 40 bits
is 40 bits.  Similarly, the capacity of most clients will be fairly
consistent.  (I have access (in theory, of course; don't mention this
to my management) (hi todd) to a hundred or so CPU's here, and that
doesn't really change too often.)
Rather than apportion the search space out dynamically on each attack,
why not simply allow attack clients to "subscribe" on a semi-permanent
basis?  All the server would have to do is make batches of ciphertext
available for cracking.  When a request comes in from a subscriber for
a copy of some ciphertext, the server knows (or at least can
legitimately suspect) that that subscriber's already-known keyspace
will be searched.
As far as getting acknowledgements of search completion, again the
server can by inference assume that (based on the prior establishment
of client capabilities) after a pre-determined period of time the key
sub-space will have been searched.  It might be appropriate for
clients to send back NACK messages, in case for example somebody shuts
down the client's network unexpectedly.  Assuming this goes pretty
smoothly one would hope that the number of failures would be
considerably smaller than the number of successs.
Again, ignore me if I'm blind to something obvious.

If the algorithm is public (and to stretch a point, if the executable

I actually consider this a feature.  With a "straight" name for the
organization, like "International Cryptographic Interest Society" or
something, we run the risk of being co-opted into the "mainstream"
without even realizing it.
There's nothing wrong with being a punk, remember.  That the word is
weighted simply means that people have to overcome prejudice.  Indeed,
much of the motivations for boosting cryptography is to protec the
rights of every individual to be opt out of conformity.  If everyone
were normal & mainstream, who'd care about hiding anything?  What's to

Whoooa there; can you really say that?  Can you really say that as
society absorbs marginalized fragments of the culture that there's not
a significant adjustment?
In 1955, if I walked down the street with tussled hair, a white
t-shirt covered by a ratty leather jacket, and messy jeans, I'd be an
"obvious" criminal delinquent; now, I'd be in a Calvin Klein add.
There's certainly a profound effect on culture wrought by the mere
existance of fringe groups, particularly if the groups can gain access
to media.

I think again that this is a generalization over the membership.  Some

the uniting factor of wanting to see cryptography popularized is
accurate, and that's the theme that binds us together (if anything

The seeding isn't "wrong"; it's a design flaw.  (At least that's my

Uhh... OK.  Sounds like a plan to me.  For critical pieces of code

Also (and note that it's been a while since I've messed around with
PC's, but since the "architecture" remains chained to an early-80's
design I suspect they're still the same) the PC clock frequency is
generally pretty low.  PC UNIX implementations usually run it at about
100 Hz, I think.  There aren't a lot of available timers on the PC.
One of them used to be used as the DRAM refresh timer; I don't know
whether they still do that.

'nuther enchilada, though if I want to keep my day job I need to get

All this fuss about credit card encryption is such BS.  My totally

I won't even dignify this by calling it speculation; it's simply and

couldn't manipulate the stock price if they wanted to, and if they

The intent of making the V chip (what does "V" stand for anyway?
"Violence?" Eerily Orwellian if so...) mandatory seems to be that it's
necessary to "protect" the people who want to "protect" their children

For how long is this really going to be the case?  As the whole world
of HTTP and related things (like Java & VRML) advances in capability
and sophistication, how long will the Compuserve/AOL/Genie "Big Online
Service" model continue to make sense?
Seems to me at as soon as things like a general-purpose browser (and
associated TCP/IP stack & PPP or SLIP) becomes as easy to load up as
an AOL demo disk, and local ISP's are listed in the yellow pages, the
advantage of being able to pay a provider for nothing more than the
routing of IP packets so that the net as a whole can be explored (and,
perhaps, more services purchased) will FAR outweigh any of the goodies
the current big providers offer.
The flip side of that, of course, is that big service providers can
offer access to their goodies to anybody with net access.
That sort of setup would make the whole concept of Internet regulation
even more bizarre; we'd really have something more directly parallel
to the phone system.

Isn't it the case that there are loopholes or explicit exceptions in

The local news here in Austin, which in general seems to have a
terrible time filling up a 30-minute news presentation, had a big
story the other morning about how an Internet pedophile had been
caught.  It seems that some dude in Oregon was running a sting (I
think it was a reporter, not police, but I'm not sure) and some loser
in Austin took the bait and actually flew out there to meet the boy of
his dreams.  (Like I've said many times, it's a Real Good Thing most
criminals are so incredibly stupid.)
It turns out this guy worked at a school for handicapped children up
in Round Rock (the heart of Williamson County, the place hard-core
"old Austin" liberals like to think of as a portal to Redneck Hell).
So they start asking questions and they find some kids who say the guy
abused them (or whatever).  (The whole story might turn out to be
bogus, for all I know; it's disappeared from my sphere of awareness.)
My wife pointed out that though the "news" people made heavy (though
generally absurd) use of the Internet connection in the story, it left
her thinking that the Internet is a damn good tool for trolling out
undesirables like pedophiles (at least the stupid ones).  It makes it
a *hell* of a lot easier to sting people when *they'll pay for the
plane tickets*!  And of course, they can't do any actual damage over
the wire while you string 'em along.

Ah, but if it hits a site that's set up with a top-level directory
which *does* contain an "index" page but whose server *doesn't*
recognize the index page name, then when you hit the site you
(probably) get one of those server-generated indices.  Those things
generally have *everything* in the directory visible (except those
files blocked by the server configuration, usually stuff like emacs
temp files), and so there you go...

Oh, right.  I remember now.  All the off-topic junk I see on this

"SIGNOFF" and "SET NO-MAIL" messages I see on the mailing lists I'm on

The "enforcement" is always a reactive thing.  I don't think you'd get
far with a parent explaining that the material they consider indecent

So you think those who want a "controlled cyberspace" would be happy
with newsgroups that stay "mostly decent"?  I strongly doubt it, and I
will also add that such "enforcement" is far, far less effective on
newsgroups than on mailing lists.

Uhh, I'd like a second opinion please doc.  Are you suggesting that
whenever anybody with cryptographic expertise (like, maybe, anybody on

export laws?

This sounds fishy to me.  I don't recall reading anything to suggest
that export of cryptographic software (or any other munition) requires
that the stuff be *used* outside the US for an offense to be
committed; why should export of a cryptographer's wetware be any

Hi.  President M5 of Psychonia here.  I'm afraid we've recently

Because Java is a general-purpose programming language, it is indeed
possible to use Java to do keyboard sniffing, just like it's possible
to use it for an adventure game, or system management software, or
anything else you can imagine a general-purpose programming language
being used for.
The real question is, "can I use a Java applet in the context of a
particular Java virtual machine implementation (like, maybe, the
Netscape Navigator web browser) to do keyboard sniffing?".
The Java interpreter is only as secure as the wrapper implementation
wants it to be.  For lots of purposes, you don't need or want any more
security for a Java program than you would for a C++ program.

If you need to worry about something showing up on your machine that's
capable of creating fake input dialogs on your screen, I claim you
have some serious problems.

But if by being used to such windows people understand that they're
not necessarily to be trusted, I don't see why that'd be an attractive
way of slipping in a trojan horse.  I mean, if you want to give
somebody a trojan horse, you don't hang a sign around its neck reading
"I am a trojan horse".

Any ideas on whether the comment in the source about the "effective
key length" trick being an export control deal is true?
If there were a known version of this floating around known to have a
40-bit restriction, is it likely that the restriction would be done by
always supplying "40" as the "bits" parameter, or would be it by
simply limiting the user key length?

Sure.  And it's also important to keep in mind that everyday some
dimwit falls prey to the pigeon drop or some other "meat-to-meat"
scam.  It'll take a few years for people to get used to security
concerns on the net, just like it took a few years for people to
figure out that you really would die if you drove your new Model T
like a maniac.

Not like I have the time or anything, but is there any value in
attempting something like "bruterc2"?
(IANARC (I am not a real cryptographer), but it looks like one trick
to that would be to somehow short-circuit the key setup stage.  I
suppose you could just start after it's mapped the user key into the
"xkey" array, but I might be missing something.)

Require it?  Of whom?  What will all these people do the day somebody implements a new
web-like internet protocol and makes a daemon available for free
anonymous download?  There seems to be some kind of wierd idea
floating around that all we need to do is to "rate those web pages".
Anyway, I don't know what more needs to be said about a rating system
other than that it's a rating system.

Well, it turns out  that (according to a nice  person at SurfWatch who
put up with the rant    I mailed in   and send  back a denial   rather
quickly) io.com isn't  actually blocked.  At least, so  they say.   No
comment on whether there's anything like the "25 complaints" policy.
I don't own SurfWatch, but if anybody does and finds blocked, I'll send in another rant.
I wonder whether they've actually considered the liability situation
in re: blocking sites that shouldn't be blocked?    I mean, sure, they
seem nice enough about setting things right (like with the Nynex sites
whose url's had "xxx" in the paths), but it seems to this non-lawyer
that a case could be made for damages inflicted by being known as a
purveyor of filthy indecency for even a short while.

BTW, did you hear that IO got on the SurfWatch "bad list" because there
were more than 25 complaints about objectionable material in the io.com
domain.  (Apparently, when SurfWatch hears more than 25 complaints
against a particular domain, the just deny access to the whole domain
rather than particular URLs.)
