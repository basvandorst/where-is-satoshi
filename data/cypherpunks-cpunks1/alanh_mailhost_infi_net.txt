When the Fed buys government bonds, the interest income goes to the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank. The Federal Resreve Bank is _not_ a government agency - it is privately owned by the member banks..

Gold is still loaned out between producers. For whatever reason, the money gained in the transaction is called "rent", not "interest".
Some time ago, the Bank of Portugal took a big loss when it loaned out gold - and the borrower defaulted.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank is a government agency.
Everyone else in the Fed - really the various regional Feds - are not
government employees. Perry explicitly mentions that there are overhead
expenses that detract from the profit - videlicet, the US Treasury doesn't
pay the operating expenses of the Fed. Therefor, the profits do not go to
the US TReasury. Certainly, the Board is in total control of the picture.
And the Treasury doesn't need the profits. HEck, somewhere around here,
I've got a quote of a Fed Regional President from the 1940's, in which he
says that the govt doesn't need revenues beyond the current interest
payable. TEchnically correct, but politically incorrect. Although, some of
us may live to see such a scenario.  It's happened to lots of countries,
and the sky didn't fall down. People just got sloshed downward on the
real-income-in-constant-dollars scale, via the mechanism of inflation.
This is not a Conspiracy Theory (tm), this is history. We've already experienced a massive loss of affluence in this country since October 1973, and it didn't cause a revolution. That's why people like Greenspan make the big bucks.

There is a guy in Tennessee who publishes a newsletter called _The Moneychanger_.  He is one of those Constitutionalists. He did put himself through hell to get acquited of an IRS charge - he is a dealer in gold and silver and claimed that he wasn't selling anything, only changing denominations of Money, with no profits. He won the federal case; the IRS called their buds at the Tenn Dept of Revenue and had him indicted on a failure-to-remit-sales-tax charge. He was convicted on that by the Jury but he is appealing; meanwhile he only deals with out-of-Tenn people.
Which just goes to show that convictions/acquitals under a jury system have a lot of random-walk flavor. Further reference at the OJ Simpson

I think the "challenges" thing has gotten too ridiculous. Didn't some guys
try to recently walk across Antarctica? Ended up eating some of their dogs
before the Norwegian Coast Guard bailed out their ass, if I recall
correctly? Why does the news media think I care if someone has succeeded in ballooning across the Atlantic Ocean?  I there any assinine project that some fool won't attempt?

I will put forth the proposition that Federal Reserve "Notes" are not A note is a promise to (a) pay
                       (b) a certain amount
                       (c) at a certain time
                       (d) to a certain person.
As in the phrase that *used to* appear on United States Currency:  "will pay the Bearer One Dollar in Silver upon Demand".  The only extant legal definition of a dollar is a Federal statute of 1792, defining it as a certain weight of pure silver.

Certainly, one can _get along_ as a tourist using only English. If you like to travel among large crowds of American tourists along well-worn tourist migration routes, go ahead and do it, I say.

Gold is almost always mined for its own market value.  Whereas most silver reaches the market as a byproduct of tin and other base-metal

Certainly, I believe TCM's proposition that there is no "economic need" for an American to learn a second language.
On the other hand, I haven't seen any demonstration of the "value" of learning history. Yet, who would argue that ignorance of history is a good policy to follow?

Is there any indication that the GRU or Chinese or Iranian intelligence (I think these are our only foes nowadays who have blue-water {to mix a metaphor} spook services) could do better than the Japanese did in sigint'ing against human speakers of Navajoe?
Is the Navajo language still extent among draft-age men?  Life in the Southwest has changed considerably since 1943.

Noting your caveat that this is a rumor, I doubt it.  I'm not aware of there being any legal basis for doing so. The only possible related thing would be for the IRS to bothyer people _after the fact_   _if and only if_ they were using barter to to hide the receipt of income. For example, if you have declared on your tax return that you are engaged in _buying and selling widgets with the intent of realizing a profit_ (Schedule C), they are likely to question whether your bartering of a widget for 5 50-cents-off-toilet-paper coupons, was really an even trade of your personal property for someone else's personal property.
Even in such case, the rule is not absolute. For example, the regulations which implement the taxation of the inter-state trade in firearms, make the presumption that the dealer does possess some number of firearms as The legal tender laws are of very limited scope. Bus companies _are_ allowed to decline to accept dollar bills and instead demand exact change in coins, for example.

While deployed to a remote radar station on an isolated island,

Young men are still being registered for the draft. In fact, in the past several years, there's been a crackdown.... no draft registration, no federal student loan.
