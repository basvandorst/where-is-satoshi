@_subject: [liberationtech] DHS considers initiating cyber attacks 
The sword is rattling the scabbard.
Silicon Valley Mercury News (Apr 16) - "Homeland Security chief  contemplating proactive cyber attacks" by Steve Johnson
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Monday she would  consider having tech companies participate with the government in  "proactive" efforts to combat hackers based in foreign countries.
Napolitano, who made the comments during a meeting at the San Jose Mercury News with the editorial board and reporters, declined to say what steps corporations and federal agencies might take against foreign cybercrooks, who have been blamed for numerous computerized incursions against the United States. She made the remarks in response to a question, and emphasized the idea is merely one she would consider and that no decisions have been made.
In discussing the private partnerships she is promoting to combat  cyberattacks, Napolitano was asked if instead of just taking defensive  measures, the government and companies should be launching proactive  counterattacks against foreign-based culprits. "Should there be some  aspect that is in a way proactive instead of reactive?" she responded, and then answered her own question with "yes." She added, "it is not something that we haven't been thinking about," noting someone else had raised the subject with her earlier Monday.
However, Napolitano said some restrictions might have to be placed on  businesses participating in such cyber activities because "what you are  doing is authorizing a private entity to do what might otherwise be  construed as an attack on another entity."

It might be worth reaching out to them to discuss their approach.  I believe Jonathan Hutson  [   ] may be subscribed to this  It also might be worthwhile to check in with the OpenRelief project to see what kind of progress they've made.  Although their focus is disaster relief, it seems like the sensor package they're working on could be adapted for other uses:

After reading Assange, et. al.'s "Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of  the Internet", wherein classical encryption is presented as a panacea for ensuring privacy in an age of mass surveillance, I found the following article succinct in questioning the long-term viability of that narrative (or at least insisting on some qualifications).  Quantum computation and communication is still a long distance away, but this article provides the outlines of how that technology will be used (and abused) by the institutions that will be able to afford it.
Aerospace & Defense News (Dec 19) - "Army Researchers Seek Secure Quantum To understand the assertion that a sufficiently large quantum computer can (hypothetically) decrypt classically encrypted communications---from any Will the economic effects of Moore's Law apply to quantum computers,  facilitating the mass distribution and use of this technology for popular quantum cryptography?  Probably not for some period of time, a time which may recapitulate the big iron power dynamics of the mainframe priesthood.  It is that interim time period when there is likely to be a disparity in access to quantum computation that gives me pause.
However, in researching this post I was happy to learn that this threat is understood and research is underway into post-Quantum cryptography, which looks like it can be implemented on classical computers.  So predictable future problems may be mitigated by avoiding reliance on particular cryptographic techniques that are known to be breakable by quantum computers, such as the RSA algorithm used by many contemporary public-key cryptography systems:
I'll readily admit that I am about out of my depth here and welcome  corrections and clarifications.  If we see this probability emerging, then it seems like liberationtechnicians should be advocating review and  redesign of the algorithms used in popular public-key cryptosystems.

@_subject: [drone-list] North Dakota Sheriff's Dept preparing to deploy UAVs 
(Mar 4) - "Grand Forks Sheriff's Department launching UAS  program" by Chris Bieri of It looks like the Grand Forks Herald has been reporting a LOT of articles about UAS's:
In part, that must be because the University of North Dakota has embraced the opportunity to become a locus for research, education, and training for unmanned aircraft systems:
It is therefore appropriate that The Center for UAS Research, Education  and Training's homepage prominently features an image of a Department of  Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection General Atomics MQ-9  Reaper "Predator B" drone, as five of DHS's seven MQ-9's are based in  North Dakota at the Grand Forks Air Force Base:
In December, Brian Bennett [  ] of the LA Times reported "  Local police say they have used two unarmed Predators based at Grand Forks Air Force Base to fly at least two dozen surveillance flights since June" in the first widely reported case of American citizens being arrested by local authorities with the assistance of drone surveillance provided by federal authorities upon request from a local law enforcement agency:
On September 13, 2010, North Dakota Senator Byron L. Dorgan convened a  field hearing "at 8 a.m. in the Red River Valley Room of the Memorial  Union, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks" on the subject of "The  Integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) Into the National Airspace System (NAS): Fulfilling Imminent Operational and Training Requirements".  North Dakota Representative Earl Pomeroy was also in attendance, helping convene a check-in meeting to spur cooperation between the FAA and Defense officials.  Secrecy News' Steven Aftergood [  ] archived a copy of the complete transcript of the meeting, including all statements by witnesses and prepared testimony included in the record:
Senator Dorgan described the context for the meeting in his opening  The hearing is about the subject of unmanned aerial
vehicles, and most particularly, the issue of training and
operations for UAVs in this region. Grand Forks and this region
of North Dakota is slated to become a major UAV center. We will
have the Predators and the Global Hawks. We'll have fleets of
Global Hawks and Predators stationed here at the Grand Forks
Air Force Base. We have Homeland Security, which flies UAVs
here. The University of North Dakota Center for Aerospace
Science is designated by law and in the DOD descriptions as the
center for UAV research. I did that because we fly unmanned
aerial vehicles in all kinds of weather, and I had visited
Nellis and Creach a number of times and discovered they do
quite well when it's warm, flying over desert sand, but they'll
be flying them in other areas of the country as well, and the
world, and having a center for research of UAVs here, connected
to the Air Force and the University of North Dakota, one of
the--probably the preeminent aviation school in the world, just
made a lot of sense.
The Senator goes on to describe reasons for convening the meeting and  mentions a kickoff roundtable discussion 19 months earlier:
Here at the University of North Dakota, at the Center for
Research for UAVs, there's a lot of work going on, on sensitive
technologies and radar and so on, on just this very subject.
About a year ago, February 16, 2009, we met in this room, not
in a hearing, but in a roundtable discussion, and we had a very
substantial discussion about what needed to be done and the
timelines to do it, in which to create routine training and
operation capability for UAVs here in this region. We had the
Air Force and the FAA talk about creating a working group, and
from that meeting, a working group was created and has been
working between then and now.
The February 2009 confluence of "Federal and state dignitaries" in Grand  Forks coincided with the opening of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Unmanned Aircraft Operations Center of North Dakota.
The reason for the presence of drones in Grand Forks can be dated to 2005, when then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld issued a " report to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission [which] noted the strategic importance of maintaining an air base in the north central United States and specifically cited the Grand Forks base for an 'emerging mission' involving UAVs, the fastest growing mission area in the Air Force."
In the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's Final Report to  the President (Sep 8 2005), page 151 (Chapter 1, "Air Force") indicates  the Grand Forks Air Force Base mission was realigned from a KC-135 tanker hub "to include the Department of Defensebs intent to bed down a family of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)":
The drones have had nests prepared to come home to roost for quite some  time, much longer than might be gauged by the amount of welcome attention garnered by a controversial Congressional mandate in the FAA  Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2012: " Not later than 270 days after  the date of enactment of this Act [(February 13, 2012)], the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with representatives of the aviation  industry, Federal agencies that employ unmanned aircraft systems  technology in the national airspace system, and the unmanned aircraft  systems industry, shall develop a comprehensive plan to safely accelerate the integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system."
It is important to understand the scope of the bureaucratic inertia (and  agility) that has been painstakingly transformed into kinetic motion over time as well as the actors involved, their dispositions, and constraints (or lack thereof).
The unmanned aircraft systems industry is represented first and foremost  by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International [  ]  which lobbies Congress (and presumably other "government, industry, and  academia" officials) on behalf of its more than 7,000 members and "2,100  member organizations from 60 allied countries":
Lobbyists from AUVSI frequently speak with elected officials, 53 of whom  are members of the Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus [  ],  co-chaired by Representatives Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-CA-25) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX-28):
Representative Buck McKeon also speaks directly to AUVSI members, as in  his keynote at the AUVSI Unmanned Systems Program Review (Feb 7-9), here  documented by Zaid Jilani of Republic Report:
During his keynote, CodePink co-founder  interrupted the  proceedings and was forcibly removed.  "War Bucks" McKeon, unruffled,  continued: " Wouldnbt we all like to cut our swords, and pull our  ploughshares and live in total world peace? Ibll tell ya, it's  not...thatbs not happening."
Finally, returning to the theme of the original link, here is a list of  all currently planned upcoming AUVSI events, including a webinar March  14th titled "UAVs Take to the Sky for Law Enforcement":

Secrecy News (May 8) - "USAF Drones May Conduct 'Incidental' Domestic  Surveillance" by  U.S. Air Force policy permits the incidental collection of domestic  imagery by unmanned aerial systems (drones), but ordinarily would not  allow targeted surveillance of a U.S. person.  The Air Force policy was  restated in a newly reissued instruction on oversight of Air Force  "Air Force Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations, exercise and  training missions will not conduct nonconsensual surveillance on  specifically identified US persons, unless expressly approved by the  Secretary of Defense, consistent with US law and regulations," the  instruction  stated.
On the other hand, "Collected imagery may incidentally include US persons or private property without consent."
"Collecting information on specific targets inside the US raises policy  and legal concerns that require careful consideration, analysis and  coordination with legal counsel.  Therefore, Air Force components should  use domestic imagery only when there is a justifiable need to do so, and  then only IAW [in accordance with] EO 12333, the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, DoD 5240.1-R, and this instruction," it said.
Legally valid requirements for domestic imagery, the instruction   said, include  surveillance of natural disasters, environmental studies, system testing  and training, and also counterintelligence and security-related  vulnerability assessments. Air Force units are authorized to acquire  domestic commercial imagery for such validated purposes.
However, "Air Force intelligence components must not conduct or give the  appearance of conducting collection, exploitation or dissemination of  commercial imagery or imagery associated products for other than approved mission purposes."  See "Oversight of Intelligence Activities,"   Air Force Instruction  14-104, April 23, 2012.
Another new Air Force Instruction deals with the basic operation of Small Unmanned Aerial Systems in domestic and foreign environments.  Among other things, it recommends caution in the use of non-uniformed personnel in conducting drone combat missions.
"To ensure the noncombatant status of civilians and contractors is not  jeopardized, commanders shall consult with their servicing judge advocate office for guidance before using civilian or contractor personnel in combat operations or other missions involving direct participation in hostilities," the instruction advised.  See "Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations,"  Air Force Instruction 11-502, volume 3, April 26, 2012.
In its new mark of the FY2013 defense authorization bill  , the House Armed Services Committee is proposing to provide the Air Force  with even more money than it requested for its Predator and Reaper drone  programs.

Secrecy News (Nov 26) - "Autonomy in Weapon Systems":
One note.  Mention is made in this document about the importance of  "verification and validation" (V&V) of systems.  Earlier this month,  DARPA's High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program awarded a  4.5 year $18M contract to an international consortium "to develop a  complete, formally proven architecture to protect the control and  communication systems of an aerial vehicle from compromise by faults and  targeted attacks."
Part of that award went to National ICT Australia [  ] which toots  its own horn for formally verifying 7,500 lines of C code. That tells you something about the challenge of "formal verification" which  mathematically proves a system will behave as specified - a much higher  bar than "rigorous" testing.
That also tells you something about the complexity of systems which have  thus far achieved formal verification.  For comparison, the Linux  kernel---which sits at the heart of many of the workstations used by the  US military's remote pilots---surpassed 15 million lines of code in  January, leading the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, to lament that he  is "afraid of the day" when there will be an error that "cannot be  evaluated anymore."
Considering DARPA knows the path to formal verification of larger systems must be cleared - demand it.  The challenge of formal verification presents a strong argument for delaying deployment of lethal autonomous systems.

The march was scheduled to travel from Islamabad to Waziristan, but was  apparently impeded by Pakistani security forces which alleged the march  was under threat.  The march stopped in Tank for a rally led by PTI head  Imran Khan [   ].
Reprieve UK was prominent in helping organize the event, represented by  Clive Smith [   ]:
A delegation of 33 Americans participated, including former US diplomat  Ann Wright and CodePink:

Secrecy News (Sep 6) - "Greater Autonomy for Unmanned Military Systems
   Urged" (cited in full)
   [1]
   The Department of Defense should focus on increasing the autonomy of
   drones and other unmanned military systems, a new report from the
   Defense Science Board said.
   DoD should "more aggressively use autonomy in military missions," the
   Board report said, because currently "autonomy technology is being
   underutilized."  See [2]"The Role of Autonomy in DoD Systems," Defense
   Science Board, dated July 2012 and released last week.
   "Autonomy" in this context does not mean "computers making independent
   decisions and taking uncontrolled action."  The Board is not calling
   for the immediate development of [3]Skynet at this time.  Rather,
   autonomy refers to the automation of a particular function within
   programmed limits.  "It should be made clear that all autonomous
   systems are supervised by human operators at some level," the [4]report
   stressed.
   Increased autonomy for unmanned military systems "can enable humans to
   delegate those tasks that are more effectively done by computer... thus
   freeing humans to focus on more complex decision making."
   "However, the true value of these systems is not to provide a direct
   human replacement, but rather to extend and complement human capability
   by providing potentially unlimited persistent capabilities, reducing
   human exposure to life threatening tasks, and with proper design,
   reducing the high cognitive load currently placed on
   operators/supervisors."
   But all of that is easier said than done.
   "Current designs of autonomous systems, and current design methods for
   increasing autonomy, can create brittle platforms" that are subject to
   irreversible error.  There are also "new failure paths associated with
   more autonomous platforms, which has been seen in friendly fire
   fatalities.... This brittleness, which is resident in many current
   designs, has severely retarded the potential benefits that could be
   obtained by using advances in autonomy."
   The Defense Science Board [5]report discusses the institutional
   challenges confronting a move toward increasing autonomy, including the
   obstacles posed by proprietary software.  It offers an extended
   discussion of conflict scenarios in which the enemy employs its own
   autonomous systems against U.S. forces.  The authors describe China's
   "alarming" investment in unmanned systems, and encourage particular
   attention to the relatively neglected topic of the vulnerability of
   unmanned systems.
   The [6]report includes some intriguing citations, such as a volume on
   [7]"Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots," and presents
   numerous incidental observations of interest.  For example:
   "Big data has evolved as a major problem at the National Geospatial
   Intelligence Agency (NGA).  Over 25 million minutes of full motion
   video are stored at NGA."
   But new sensors will produce "exponentially more data" than full motion
   video, and will overwhelm current analytical capabilities.
   "Today nineteen analysts are required per UAV orbit [i.e. per 24 hour
   operational cycle].  With the advent of Gorgon Stare, ARGUS, and other
   Broad Area Sensors, up to 2,000 analysts will be required per orbit."
   The government "can't hire enough analysts or buy enough equipment to
   close these gaps."

     Agencies Could Improve Information Sharing and End-Use Monitoring on
     Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Exports
     Full 58-page report, PDF:
     [3]
     GAO-12-536, Jul 30, 2012
     What GAO Found
     Since 2005, the number of countries that acquired an unmanned aerial
     vehicle (UAV) system nearly doubled from about 40 to more than 75.
     In addition, countries of proliferation concern developed and
     fielded increasingly more sophisticated systems. Recent trends in
     new UAV capabilities, including armed and miniature UAVs, increased
     the number of military applications for this technology. A number of
     new civilian and commercial applications, such as law enforcement
     and environmental monitoring, are available for UAVs, but these
     applications are limited by regulatory restrictions on civilian
     airspace.
     The United States likely faces increasing risks as countries of
     concern and terrorist organizations seek to acquire UAV technology.
     Foreign countries' and terrorists' acquisition of UAVs could provide
     them with increased abilities to gather intelligence on and conduct
     attacks against U.S. interests. For instance, some foreign countries
     likely have already used UAVs to gather information on U.S. military
     activities overseas. Alternatively, the U.S. government has
     determined that selected transfers of UAV technology support its
     national security interests by providing allies with key
     capabilities and by helping retain a strong industrial base for UAV
     production. For instance, the United Kingdom and Italy have used
     UAVs purchased from the United States to collect data on Taliban
     activity in Afghanistan.
     The United States has engaged in multilateral and bilateral
     diplomacy to address UAV proliferation concerns. The United States
     principally engaged the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to
     address multilateral UAV proliferation concerns. Since 2005, the
     United States proposed certain significant changes to address how
     MTCR controls UAVs, but members could not reach a consensus for
     these changes. Also, while the Wassenaar Arrangement (Wassenaar)
     controls the export of some key dual-use UAV components, it does not
     control other dual-use technologies that are commonly used in UAVs.
     The Department of State (State) has also used diplomatic cables to
     address the proliferation of UAV-related technologies bilaterally.
     State provided to GAO about 70 cables that it sent from January 2005
     to September 2011 addressing UAV-related concerns to about 20
     governments and the MTCR. Over 75 percent of these cables focused on
     efforts by a small number of countries of concern to obtain UAV
     technology.
     U.S. agencies coordinate in several ways to control the spread of
     UAV technology, but could improve their UAV-related information
     sharing. For instance, an interagency group reviews many license
     applications to export UAV technology. However, there is not a
     formal mechanism to ensure that licensing agencies have relevant and
     timely intelligence information when making licensing decisions.
     Also, State's licensing database cannot provide aggregate data on
     military UAV exports State has authorized, which may impair the U.S.
     government's ability to oversee the release of sensitive UAV
     technology. The Department of Defense (DOD) and State each conduct
     end-use monitoring of some UAV exports, but differences in the
     agencies' programs may result in similar types of items being
     subject to different levels of oversight.

The WSJ's Jennifer Valentino-DeVries broke this story yesterday,  unfortunately behind the WSJ's paywall:
For a solid summary, see  coverage at Slate:
Slate (Apr 25) - "Judge Rejects FBI Attempt to Use Spyware to Infiltrate  Unknown Suspect's Computer" by Ryan Gallagher:
Or go straight to the Memorandum and Order, which is quite the read:
Magistrate Judge Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas was  presented with an FBI affidavit requesting a Rule 41 search and seizure  warrant targeting an unknown computer at an unknown location used by an  unknown suspect(s).  The lack of specificity was sufficient grounds for  declining to issue the warrant, and Judge Smith goes through each of Rule 41's five territorial limits which the government's application failed to satisfy.  Although it's interesting to see that the FBI hoped to satisfy the territorial limit by performing the search on the computer's data once it was brought into the Judge's territory, the interesting part concerns just how the FBI hoped to acquire and transport that data: by cracking or phishing into the unknown target computer, installing a sophisticated piece of malware, searching for and gathering information for 30 days, while exfiltrating significant quantities of data out of the system.
What kind of data?  Although the original affidavit and the revised  affidavit were sealed (the FBI having been given at least one opportunity to clarify their intent), Magistrate Judge Smith was kind enough to cite the section of the affidavit which details exactly what information the FBI intended to acquire from the unknown computer:
Later in the Memorandum, Judge Smith takes the FBI to task for having the gall to state:
I applaud Magistrate Judge Stephen Smith for his principled action in this circumstance, which is one amongst many significant actions he has taken to resist court secrecy, the abuse of secret "gag" orders, and the  application of the Constitution to electronic surveillance requests:

HT  who took umbrage at Chris Anderson's "don't worry be droned" article (emphasis mine), also in this issue.
Time (Jan 31) - "Why We Shouldn't Fear Personal Drones" by Chris Anderson:
I wanted to take a moment to explain how Mr. Anderson is attempting to  take some liberties with the history of computation here.  The concept and prototype of personal computers first emerged in the late 1960's amongst a small group of academics and innovators on the west coast, so I'm not really sure how folks could have had a more open-minded view about the potential uses of computers at that time.  Up to that time and into the mid-70's computers took the form of bulky mainframes and mini-computers, only accessible to government agencies and very large corporations.  I myself have not encountered much in the literature that talks about people fearing computers in the 1960s, other than some amusing IBM public relations efforts.  So I can only conclude that Mr. Anderson has constructed a straw man through unsourced assertions.  For facts, I recommend reading about the emergence of the idea and implementation of personal computers in John Markoff's _What the Dormouse Said: How Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry_:
And as  said, someone should remind Mr. Anderson that computers  *have* proven remarkably good at spying on us.  I suppose we could be  gracious and say the qualification "that computers would be used  *primarily* to spy on us" let's him off the hook, but I'm afraid this  article is too obviously biased by Mr. Anderson's desire to service and  profit from the DIY drone community through his company 3D Robotics.

Incidentally, NICTA are the same researchers hired by DARPA to make the  U.S. drone fleet safe from hackers.  Looks like there might be some open  source tools emerging from the effort.

Hey, it's a craigslist for drones!
High level categories:
Amateur, Commercial, and Law Enforcement drones (new and used).
Parts, Cameras, and Repair Services.
Aerial Services, Pilot Training, Drone Consultants, and Jobs.
It looks like a lot of interesting information may accumulate here.

Following up on this thread, TechJect just closed out their Indiegogo
   campaign, which aimed to raise $110,000 dollars to cover their initial
   manufacturing goals.
   They raised $1,142,523.

     The military applications of this are silent surveillance and
     reconnaissance within buildings. The model they're selling here only
     weighs a few grams and probably couldn't sustain weaponry in the
     payload. The dragonfly design appears to be extremely agile, though
     and I guess there's nothing preventing larger models.
     The video seems to be actively soliciting sales from the
     intelligence and defence communities.

   From the article:
   So, uh, yeah, who are these guys and where did this thing come from?
   Well, the company, TechJect, is a spinoff from Georgia Tech's Robotics
   & Intelligent Machines Lab, and their robotic dragonfly has already
   been funded, with a million dollars (!) from the US Air Force Office of
   Scientific Research. I dunno what sort of super secret laser canon
   totin' version of this robot the USAF is currently playing around with,
   but the specs of the robot Dragonflies that are being offered on
   Indiegogo are pretty damn impressive.

dnaInfo (Jan 11) - "NYPD Eyeing Drones to Monitor Crowds":

     Drones might eventually be used for surveillance in New York City,
     Police Commissioner Ray Kelly revealed Thursday.
     Kelly said the eyes in the sky -- which have worried civil rights
     activists -- could prove useful when sizing-up demonstrations,
     adding to an NYPD arsenal that already includes 3,000 cameras and
     high-powered anti-aircraft rifles that can shoot down planes.
     "We're looking into it," Kelly told an audience during a rare public
     interview at the 92nd Street Y Thursday night. "Anything that helps
     us."
     Kelly noted that drones are widely used in law enforcement,
     especially along the border.
     But New York presents challenges.
     "There's a lot of air traffic," he noted. As a result, "The only
     thing we would do is maybe use the cheap $250 ones to take a look
     and see the size of the demonstration or something along those
     lines."
     Kelly noted that a drones program is not being actively pursued at
     this time.

Haven't had a chance to review thoroughly, but looks like there's some  interesting questions posed about the training the pilots received (a  6-month course compressed to 1-month resulting in an FAA license) and  similarities w/ video games.
