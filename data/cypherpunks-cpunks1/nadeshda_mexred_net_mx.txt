City and I`m writing this letter because in one of my classes I was
asigned to do a discertation on what can be done to control the Internet
in relation to it`s content and use, to protect the public at large
using the methods to protect your privacy.  I have found a lot of
information of these servidors, but the reason to write this e-mail is
for asking some questions about the subject:

end you asked me why do I think legislation would be needed?
you said you have to protect your privacy from the gobernent, I�m agree
of that, but I have other situations:
to attract children who are then raped and murdered, kidnapped and sold
on the black market, many of these pediophiles work out in open in
complete anonimaty, due to the structure of the Internet and many
service providers.
each other, gather information and funding establish methods,
investigate methods of terrorism (how to make a bomb in your house using
abono and household chemicals.  This is an area that should be strongly
controlled, but the question is how do you do it without restricting the
rights of the average citizen?
