AO> I consider Mr. Bell to be a crank and a loon.

Jim Bell has advocated nothing less than paid death squads using crypto as a
means to hide payment to these murderous terrorists.  If you can find a conspirator
of murder as " highly intelligent, knowledgeable, and overall nice person" then
you also are in need of immediate mental health intervention.
Should the mainstream media ever get wind of Bell's lunacy it will be one more
nail in the crypto-coffin spurring the Feds and international anti-crypto efforts to
a frenzy.  Bell is either a total fucking lunatic of the extreme right wing (having
read his suck ups posts supporting General Linda Thompson) or an agent provocateur for the Feds.  One is as bad as the other.  To quote your own
words to Mr. Olsen; " I've also formed a rather negative opinion of you, based
on your actions in this incident."
AO> He has no interest in any sort of honest discussion.
DV>  Honest or dishonest, the discussion of Jim's political views has nothing DV> to do with encryption.
His plans for death squads success DEPENDS on the anonymity provided by
AO> He wishes to draw in others in the hope of "punishing me".
DV> You're punishing yourself by destroying your credibility and carrying on this
DV> silly flame war. You've kicked Jim off of "your" mailing list, pushing the
DV> flame war that you've started to this list. I don't appreciate this.
And you think YOU have credibility here?  Sounds like you are cut from
the same murderous cloth as Jim Bell.
I pray that if by some freak of anarchy Bell's plan ever comes to
fruition both you and Bell will be the first victims of your own murderous

The John Doe NYM/Remailer interface for Windows is a most excellent
program that will allow even the most cypher-illiterate to make use of
the technology that has been the exclusive domain of those in the
"techno-know".  It was a piece of cake to set up, obtain a NYM and select
inbound and outbound remailers with options to chain as many as your
paranoia deemed appropriate.
$25.00 seemed a little steep but they will get my $$$.  Nice Job.

@_subject: PIDAHO and EUDORA PRO 2.2 
In response to the "what has John Doe got that PIDAHO doesn't" messages I tried to
PIDAHO v2.6b.  I am unable to make it work.  Messages from PIDAHO can not be sent to
the selected and OnLine EUDORA PRO application.  I also suspect that it has something to do with the fact  PIDAHO is a 16bit app and EUDORA PRO v2.2 is 32bit.  I am running it on a WIN95 internal tcp/ip stack to a dial up ppp connection.
Any help and or advice would be sincerely appreciated.
