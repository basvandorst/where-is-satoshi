Nazi Fascism at work.  Legalized thugs, the NEW brownshirts.
All that shit to arrest some guys who may or may not have taken things from graves???  Someone explain to me how we need to have people with Automatic Weapons arrest some guys for a trivial crime?  Nazi Fascism at work.
You've gotta be shitting me.  Forest Rangers with Automatic Weapons????? I'd hate to see what they'd do to a guy lighting a match in a forest camping ground.
This incident demands armed rebellion and government overthrow.  It demands people going to parks to carry automatic or semi-automatic rifles.
If this isn't pure evidence of preparing a takeover of fascist forces, then i don't know what its.
This is another big leap past what our Founders intended.
Then it's time for all citizens of this country who love freedom to form a militia, controlled by citizens.  Arm yourselves.
If necessary is another double-talk bullshit term meaning carry weapons dangerous to freedom-loving citizens everywhere.
And some beaureacratic bullshit along with Fascism.
Someone PLEASE bump off Bill McHitler.
He's the same jackass that was proposing the "Dangerous Predators" bill jailing kids with adults.
Why not go ahead and just for ministries of Peace, Truth, Plenty?
It's time we the people started doing the same.
Don't forget interrogation beatings, and illegal search and seizures.
And they wonder why the Davidians were armed to the teeth.
Also purposes include fighting strong crypto among citizens, and threatening makers of crypto.
That's why we need to have MORE citizen militias then EVER.
If I start seeing postal agencies with swat teams I'm joining a militia.
As I said, Nazi Fascism, and usurping of freedom.
I'm increasingly astonished at the rate we citizens lose military weapons.
Yes, horrifying that soon it will lead to Dictatorship.
There is a constraining mechanism, bombs and military rifles in the hands of citizens.
Well, the Feds are above the law anyway.
War against citizens.
Time to see more bomb-throwing freedom fighters here in America.
Nazi Fascism at work.
It's time to rebel.
Many citizens have been given the incentive to make themselves armed and VERY dangerous to fascism loving nazis like Clinton and Freeh.
Obviously, a dangerous crime to society.
Stealing land from citizens for use by the rulers.  I'm telling ya, it's FASCISM.
Seize it for what?
The time has come for all people to revolt with weapons; bombs, guns, knives, and anything that can kill Fascist Nazis and their supporters.  Aquire weapons, form militias, retake the country.  It's time to reinstate Democracy.
If this continues, we're going to see more Oklahoma Cities.
Arm yourselves, arm your neighbors, arm freedom lovers.  Fight Fascism.  That is the ONLY answer.
And they still wonder why McVeigh said "Enough!!!"
"There's something wrong when Ranger Rick gets and automatic weapon, and Federal agencies become blurred with the Military."

FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED SEPT. 5, 1997
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    Define 'stealing'
    Winding up an ongoing but perhaps instructive debate with e-mail
correspondent J.P., I had offered:
  "The notion that it's all right to steal at gunpoint 'some modest
as long it serves a legitimate public need' ignores the simple moral
that the end cannot be allowed to justify the means."
  J.P. responded: "Define steal. If you are benefiting from having a
and national defense system, and pay nothing for its upkeep, then you
be stealing.
  OK -- one final time:
    #  #  #
  Hi, J.P. --
  Probably the one place where we are still furthest apart is the
definition of "theft."
  To me, it merely has to do with voluntarism, versus levying something
under the threat of force.
  None of my federal taxes are paid voluntarily. I allow them to be
"withheld" from my paycheck because if I tell my employer I won't work
any longer unless he stops "withholding," I'll be out of a job.
  Likewise, any other "compliance" I grant the federals is because they
have repeatedly demonstrated they will seize (start ital)all(end ital)
my paycheck, and all of my bank accounts (even if I find myself
and have so notified them), if I do not "comply"  -- all this without so
much as a signed court order.
  Under those conditions -- even if I didn't know how wasteful,
and counterproductive most of their schemes really are -- what would I
to how "noble" a purpose the federals assure me some of my moneys will
  Try approaching someone taking money out of her ATM. Assure her that
least 60 percent of the money you're seizing from her at gunpoint will
used to buy medicines for the poor. Proceed to (start ital)buy(end ital)
medicines for the poor with 60 percent of her money, and keep careful
  When you're identified from the ATM camera tape and arrested, show the
police your evidence that most of the money went to "a noble purpose,"
while the rest merely covered your "operating overhead." Thus, you
committed no "theft," and they'll let you go without prosecution. Right?
  I don't think so.
  Your underlying premise is that "government" can properly do things
would be crimes if they were done by individuals, as long as they're
the greater good of the many." But that one concession leads, in the
to all the evils of the police state.
  On the other hand, you puzzle me with the assertion: "If you are
benefiting from having a court and national defense system, and pay
for its upkeep, then you would  be stealing."
  Even if it weren't for the fact that more and more of these "Defense"
"court" dollars go to enslave and murder American citizens who have
no one -- whose only "offense" is refusal to kneel before their federal
masters -- I still wouldn't follow this.
  If a wealthy philanthropist builds a free public library, and I use
am I "stealing?" After all,  I have "benefited from it without paying
its upkeep."
  If a direct-mail scam artist mails me some gimcrack plastic camera I
never ordered, and then tries to bill me $29.95 for "shipping and
handling," do I have to pay? I don't think so. Yet under your theory, he
would be allowed to seize from my bank account or paycheck any amount by
which he could demonstrate I had "benefited" from his unsolicited "gift"
... couldn't he?
  Unless (again) government has a right to do things which would be
if undertaken by mortal men. In which case I ask again, since we the
citizens cannot possibly "delegate" to the government rights or powers
which we never possessed, where does government claim to derive the
or power to do these immoral things? From the same place the invading
bandit chieftain (or, perhaps, Union bluebelly?) gets his "right" to
your daughter and then ransom her back to you for half your wealth? At
point of his bayonet, and nowhere else?
  Your only answer seems to be, "The government has to do these things,
because we're not sure we could find enough funds, otherwise."
  Imagine a bank robber patiently explaining to you: "I have certain
absolute necessities, such as keeping my family fed, and buying
and gas for the car. In the past, the only reliable way I've found to
these requirements is bank robberies. Now, if you want me to reform my
robbery system, perhaps taking a larger share from the larger, richer
banks, I'll be happy to negotiate some reasonable reforms.
  "But heavens, you can't expect me to take the risk of giving up bank
robbing entirely, on the strength of this theory that 'Somehow, I could
probably keep my family fed by taking some kind of a steady job.' Don't
see panhandlers on the street every day? Aren't those people who tried
pie-in-the-sky, 'non-coercive' way of 'earning' enough money, and
I'd look a fine figure, standing at my child's grave, explaining 'I
you wouldn't starve if I gave up bank-robbing. I thought it MIGHT work.'
fact, no single bank robber of my acquaintance has ever given up the
voluntarily. Surely SOMEONE would have done so, in all these years, if
way could be made to work, don't you think?"
  If a private citizen told you this, you would doubtless judge him an
incurable sociopath, and hope to see him shot down or caged before he
terrorize and kill too many more innocent bank tellers and patrons. But
when a group of men who call themselves "the government" say this same
thing, you tell me they're being sensible and prudent.
  Others -- whether singly or in organized groups -- can volunteer to do
things which benefit me, without my permission. Presumably, they figured
the benefits to them would justify their proceeding, even without my
agreeing to help them.
  They have (start ital)no(end ital) moral right to then turn around and
bill me for a share of a thing they have done without seeking my
help and permission in advance (what would be the proper charge for my
taking aesthetic pleasure in someone else's architecturally pleasing
building, I wonder?) under the theory: "You benefited, so you have to
  They can only extract such a non-voluntary payment from me by force or
the threat of force ... which is theft.

At first, I was confused...
  Here I was, the only resident being held in the Cypherpunks Home for
the Criminally Insane. Yet, every day I would receive hundreds of posts
purporting to be from a variety of individuals subscribed to the list.

  Had my Multi-Personality Disorder gotten so out of hand that I was,

This is actually from list forger, Robert Hettinga, who was trying

  Originally a government-generated hereditary Trojan virus developed

@_subject: There's something wrong when...Shitty Laws! 
I think I first realized just how much Tim May's .sig lines are a
genuine harbinger of the future when I arrived at  to
find that there are "Compost Standards in Canada," as explained by
The Composting Council of Canada.
  In short, if I wanted to stack some turds on top of each other, then
I had to keep in mind that:
"In Canada, three organizations are responsible for the development of standards and regulations for compost and composting: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), the provincial and territorial governments, and the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) (through the Bureau de normalisation du Qu�bec (BNQ)). This collective responsibility reflects government regulatory requirements (of both the AAFC and the provinces and territories) as well as voluntary industry initiatives (BNQ)."
 { The word "voluntary" was in _bold_ print! (Mandatory-Voluntary?) }
When I first got the urge to phone these people up and scream, "YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT _SHIT_, FOR SHIT'S SAKE!"	was when I read that,
"All compost that is sold in Canada must comply with the requirements of the Fertilizers Act. This includes provisions for product safety, benefit claims and labeling."
  Product safety? (Turds are dangerous? You can 'slip' on them?)
  Benefit claims? (You mean turds _don't_ cure cancer?)
  Labeling? (It's SHIT! It's hard to fool people about that.)
  I found out I could avoid fines and imprisonment by reading, "...a National Standard of Canada entitled: 'Organic Soil Conditioners -
Composts (BNQ); Guidelines for Compost Quality (CCME); and future amendments to the Fertilizers Act and Regulations (AAFC).'"
  "Future amendments?"
  I had to worry about past turds coming back to haunt me, if the laws
should change in the future?
  I was consoled by the fact that these requirements were in the best
interests of the different organizations involved, and to ensure that
all of the turds in Canada are "consistent."
"These provide for a significant level of national consistency by containing virtually identical technical requirements while ensuring that the mandates and interests of the different organizations are
  My consolation was short-lived, however, as I soon found out that if
I didn't understand the proper turd linguistics involved, I could still
be in big trouble:
"Definition of Compost"
"'Composting' and 'compost' are two distinct terms. The former refers to the bio-oxidation process and the latter refers to the resulting product: stabilized organic matter."
"As agreed upon by the CCME, BNQ and AAFC, compost is:
     'A solid mature product resulting from composting, which is a       managed process of bio-oxidation of a solid heterogeneous organic       substrate including a thermophilic phase.'"
  Then, of course, to remain free from fine and imprisonment, I had to be aware of the:
Classification of Compost
  according to:
BNQ Standards
CCME Guidelines
AAFC Regulations
  As well as keeping in mind:
"The Four Criteria: Maturity, Foreign Matter, Trace Elements and   Maturity? (You can 'molest' a turd? I could be a 'turdophile'?)
  Foreign Matter? (Hey! There's a turd in your turd!)
  Trace Elements? (I have to give the turds multi-vitamins if they
                   don't measure up?)
  Pathogens? (They mention checking for "sharp objects" in it. If it
              is a 'long' sharp object, is it illegal to carry the turd
              in California?)
  After memorizing the Fertilizer Act and all other regulations and
legislation involved, I piled some turds in my yard, next to the
  It was a week later, when I began to follow the instructions to
turn it over and mix it up that I was arrested for "being involved
in 'bad shit'."
The worst part is that because I was turning it over and stirring it
when arrested, I will get an "extra five years" for "use of encryption
in the commision of a composting crime."

@_subject: Sweden's Social Democrats Sterilize the Inferior 
It seems to me that today's society, like Nazi society, is heavily
involved in influencing the evolutionary direction of "humanity by controlling genetic factors in reproduction."
  However, as Adam points out, society currently weights it's
eugenics program in favor of those whose survival and/or level of
subsistence is based on the incomes earned by other people who are
more fitted for survival.
  And today we have a forced child-bearing program based on rewarding
those who bear children with survival support that they would not
otherwise receive. Even when the individual has a desire to change
their position in life, they usually get little support for that.
Instead, we make it much easier to just pop a little-one in the oven
and say goodbye to all of your survival woes.
  The problems are *known* problems which remain unsolved--the question is, "Why?".
  That, indeed, is half of the problem. The other side of the coin
is that the capitalist/fascist earned income and/or welfare system is
now just as dependent on maintaining the status-quo. As is the law
enforcement/judicial/prison system of justice.
  It used to be the occasional war which sustained a robust economy.
Now it is a 'constant' war which helps to sustain the economy. The
War on Drugs. How many people in this country owe their jobs to
drug addicts. A damn large number, but do drug addicts get any thanks
for boosting employment (and TV's)?
  Praise the Lord!
  I think much of the country is beginning to realize that we are now
in a Catch-22 situation where "solving" societies problems will "cause"
a great many problems in itself.
  Solve the drug problem tomorrow, and we will have doctors, lawyers,
policemen and social workers out begging in the streets to feed their
families. Solve the welfare problem tomorrow, and we will have riots
in the streets by those on 'both' sides of the issue, no matter what
the nature of the changes.
  {e.g. - I can give everyone on welfare, in the whole world, a good
  paying job in Inuvik, starting tomorrow. So now we can begin the
  violent, bloody debate on "forced relocation."}
Blackmail and threats:
The Medical Board approved of the operation. Since physical force was prohibitied, the school management and the doctor used blackmail to make Astrid consent to sterilization. If she did not approve of this little operation, they threatened her, she would face life
Thousands of healthy, intelligent persons were submitted to the same treatment as Astrid was. The medical arguments were, however, a little different according to what sex the individuals belonged to. Boys ready for sterilization were rather described as unreliable, dishonest and mischievous. (irreverent cypherpunks!)
There has not been a real settlement with the period of sterilization.
The National Institute of Racialiology was never discontinued, but had its name changed into The Institution of Medical Geneticsnd was assimilated into Uppsala University in 1959.
  I already knew a lot about the history of the eugenics movement,
as well as its 'shift' to new organizations with the same old faces,
and the same underlying ethics and rational behind them.
  I didn't learn about this on the ABC TV News, nor in Time Magazine,
nor any of the 'mainstream' media. I learned about this on the types
of websites which gave me information on the reptilian Nazi aliens
from outer space, who live in underground bunkers throughout the
world. This is also where I learned about Planned Parenthood and
its successors being an offshoot of the Eugenics/Purification movement. And about the U.S.'s rich and politically elite of today
owe much of their family's money to working closer with Hitler than
any of the Death Camp guards. And about the U.S. gun laws being based
on the Nazi gun laws of Hitler's era.
  To tell the truth, I have absolutely no interest in becoming a
raving lunatic who believes in reptilian Nazi's from outer space
living in underground bunkers beneath my home town, but the problem
is that the rest of the information I am getting on the 'lunatic'
sites is proving much more reliable than the information I received
in my years of education within the public school system.
  The problem with lunatic sites is that too many of them are not
afraid to supply facts and references from established, reliable
sources, including government documents, while the corresponding
government-backed versions of events involve "magic bullet"'s and
John Does who appear and disappear like the Cheshire cat, at the
government's convenience.
  The problem with mainstream news sites is when a story surfaces
which lends credence to the wild-eyed claims of the 'lunatic' news
sites, the story suddenly disappears, to be replaced with a story
of a fireman saving a cute kitten from a tree.
  The problem with reading both the mainstream ~and~ the lunatic
news sites is that a very disturbing picture develops.
  Portions of the 'free world' imprison more people than dictatorships,
but for the "right" reasons, instead of the "wrong" reasons.
  Human-rights-defending liberals have sterilized many, many times
the number of people that genetic-purification-monster Nazi's ever
dreamed of, but for the "right" reasons, instead of the "wrong"
  Every evil that has ever been done under the sun (or the moon, for
that matter) is still being done, but under the "right" name, using
the "right" terminology, and for the "right" reasons. (The chief
justification always seems to lie in a variation of 'renaming' the
4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse.)
  "Assassination Politics" is beginning to sound more and more like
a valid electoral system. One dollar, one vote.
  Perhaps Jim Bell and Tim May can corroborate on a sequel, "Nuclear
Assassination Politics."

If you have a death-wish, then send this message again through the
Canadian Mountie remailer.  {:>)-----<
{HELP! They knocked me down and cut off my arms!}
 I presume the message you are referring to on 24/8/97 is the one
which answers your previous anonymous inquiry by saying,
 "Only for the moment we are saying nothing."
 It meant what it said. However, since the moment is over I suppose
there is no harm in saying "something."  I will therefore give you
a modicum of information on the messages which have passed through
the cypherpunks list since your original notification that something
was in the wind.
  For starters, although I have not seen the original email which you
received but I believe that if you read it closely you will see that
it implied that the coming messages to the list would be in a form
which was _analogous_ to the event, whereas you seemed to take it
literally as a plan to "Nuke D.C." [How you managed to come to the conclusion that spooks and shadows
would refer to a coming event directly totally escapes me!?!]
 If you will reinterpret the posts in question in light of the event,
I believe you will see the thread that winds through them.
 As you were told, the AOL'er messages were used as markers to divine
which of the coming messages contained stegonographic messages of one
sort or another, or pointers to graphics containing the stegonography.
I am assuming you understood this and sent the AOL'er message saying,
"Please send more details...thanks"
 If you had not taken the phrase "Nuke D.C." so literally you would
have noticed that the "Fade to Gray" post linked the coming major
event (Nuke D.C.) to foreigners, automobiles and death.
 You were not alone in your request for details regarding the message
in the Quote of the day:
which had been sent by one of the Canadians involved in ferreting out the details of the coming event.
 One of the cypherpunk list members posted the question, "When is X-Day
supposed to be?" when there was no mention of 'X-Day' in the quote. This
understandably led to postponement of the event while those involved
checked to see if there had been a breach in their security.
  The subsequent message which stated, "I don't know what you mean by
'When is X-Day supposed to be?'" was interpreted by those involved to
indicate that full details of their plans remained a mystery to those
who were trying to expose and stop it.
  After they had put things in motion to proceed with their backup plan,
however, two more messages came to the list which indicated that there
was more known about their plan than they had suspected.
 In reply to the post expressing lack of knowledge about the timing of
X-Day, a post from _lne.com_ (surprise, surprise) suggested that X-Day
referred to people who are going to be "taken from the earth" (death)
by "pleasure saucers" (limosene) and noting that the limosene would
be operated by "Greys" (a reference to the  ending of
the "Fade To Gray" post--indicating a spook/LEA connection). The post
ended by suggesting the time of the event might be "April" (4 o'clock)
and gave a pointer to a sight with a graphic stego which would provide
a visual message.
 The second post that came well after it had been decided to proceed
with the backup plan said,
 After this post appeared on the cypherpunks list, a Timmy C. Mayflower
ASCII art spam showed up on the list from a juno remailer, but it had
a Timothy C. May .sig following the artwork. (Followed by the proverbial
GJBuller response.)
 Then both the juno remailer and the toad list experienced problems with
multiple messages being sent to _some_ people and _not_ others, as well
as _some_ people not getting certain messages at all.
  You will also note that, as the "Fade To Gray" post indicated (re: all
the cypherpunks being "out of town" at the time of the event), there was
no activity on the list in the time surrounding the event.
  As for the information in the graphic pointed to by the lne.com post,
it was never considered to be anything but an attempt at intentional
 You were told months ago that Diana's current power came from the failure of the so-called suicide attempt and that the agreement to
leave her free to continue her public activities was contingent upon
her remaing free from political matters. You were also informed that
her involvement with the Labor Party land-mine issue was a breach of
that agreement, as was her June 13th reference to the resistance of
the Conservative party in this regard.

out for yourself what her link to the Harrods clan indicated. You were
made aware of everything you needed to be sitting on top of the story.
 Given the fact that you have shown so little ability to act on the
information you have already been given, we are probably wasting our time by giving you any further information. Regardless, if you wish to

The classified information Sockowitz took was so sensitive it threatened

@_subject: Adding Memory to the Net 
This is an interesting proposal.  It would be easier for people who
are new to this business if there were more specifics about how this
would be implemented.  I'm sure you have particular techniques in mind
for splitting the data across servers, etc., but everybody else
doesn't necessarily know what they are.  Examples are nice because you
can go over them one bit at a time.
Here are some ignorant comments and questions.
Why is the Trusted Agent necessary?  What does the agent do that Bob
couldn't do himself?  It seems like Bob could split up the data and
pay the servers to hold it just as well as the agent.  And he wouldn't
have to trust anybody.
Or the people getting the data could also pay small fee for good
service.  Like a tip, if storing the data itself is the dominant cost.
This makes it harder to attack the servers by saturating them with
requests for data.
Usenet has traditionally been free for posters.  This model could
continue if there were users who were willing to pay to see other
people's posts.  Servers would keep the data around so long as there
seemed to be people asking for it.
You could imagine the price going up over time as fewer people want to
see it.  At some point not enough people may want to pay as much money
so it goes away.  In this model the server operators would just be
information speculators.
And, if The Bad Guys started knocking out servers, there would be a
powerful financial incentive to start serving the information that was
eliminated since its market price should go up.
It would be nice if the ten cents sells a promise by the server to
make the data available for some period of time in a way which is
independently auditable.  If the server stops carrying the data, Bob
can publish his proof that he was defrauded.  Because the facts would
not be in doubt, it would be unlikely to happen frequently.
This is very cool.  You can hide 256 bits pretty easily, which makes
The Great Satan's job harder.
Would this really be worth the effort?  If Bob wants to pay to put the
file up twice, why not let just let him?

It seems likely that Something Is Afoot.  Let's not assume that it is
centered on preserving Charles Windsor's shot at the throne.
Most likely those Shadowy People who preserve social order have been
concerned about the stability of the Monarchy and are now taking steps
to preserve it.
A commonly perceived problem with monarchy is the strict rules of
inheritance.  From time to time a person totally unsuited to the job
pops up.  Not all societies in all of history have found this problem
insurmountable.  (Examples: The Man in the Iron Mask, or the peculiar
deaths of Queen Hatshepsut's older brothers, or the death of Peter the
Great's only son, etc.)
Diana, obviously, was unsuited to the job and did not seem to
understand it.  R.I.P.
Diana, for all the trouble she caused, did manage to arouse interest
in the Monarchy.  Her death has caused millions of people in Britain
and elsewhere to become deeply emotionally involved with the Monarchy.
This emotional capital is far better than the lassitude which preceded
her.  While many perceptions of the Royal Family are not positive,
this can be easily transformed into adulation of the Monarchy using
the vehicle of Diana's sons.
Charles is no prize.  He's managed to muff an easy job.  It is
possible that the Monarchy would not survive his accession to the
Look for the death of Charles, probably before the Queen dies.  An
accident would do it, but a "suicide" would add some spice, arouse
sympathy, and be less suspicious.  (Two fatal accidents would be
extremely unlikely, whereas the odds of a suicide under these
circumstances cannot be calculated.)  A "lone nut" with a gun would
also do the trick, although it's getting old.
This would pave the way for a smooth handoff of power from the well
regarded Queen to one of Diana's well regarded sons.  Order will have
been restored.

The Electronic Forgery Foundation is proud to announce a major breakthrough in encryption technology -- Forged Encryption.
We are offering a prize of $10,000,000.00 for anyone who can
correctly decipher the following Forged Encryption message.
The EFF doesn't have a copy of the correct answer locked away in
a secret underground cave in Tibet, for verification, because
the above Forged Encryption message is just a bunch of crap we
typed in pretty much at random.
Does the government want to keep your private key in escrow? Give
them a copy of your EFF private key.
Hell, give them _two_ copies, in case one is corrupted.{;>) Smile
when you give them to the government agent. Ask him how his day
has been. Offer him some coffe, and ask about his family. Tell him you will send him a Christmas card with another copy of your
EFF private key, just in case the government misplaces the copies
you gave them.
Put your hand over your heart, salute the flag, and sing "God Bless
America" as the government agent leaves. Then fart.
Use the EFF Forged Encryption sofware regularly, to send messages
with Subject:'s like "The Plot Against the PREZ," "Confirmation of
the date of our armed assault," "The Nuke has arrived."
Keep a copy of your EFF Forged Encryption secret key in a directory
named "Off the Pigs." Most importantly, never reveal in your private email to others that
you are a deaf, dumb and blind quadraplegic who has been homebound
since birth. That way, the outrageous claims that government agents
make against you in their secret deposition for a warrant to kick
in your door and terrorize you will look all the more foolish during
your trial.
We at the Electronic Forgery Foundation realize that some of you wise
guys are thinking that, for $10 million, it is well worth your while
to write a program that will decipher the above message into something
meaningful. Well, knock yourself out, dudes, but if you think that

Does anyone know if the government has released any firm figures on the
number of lives that would be saved from terrorist activities with the
outlawing of strong encryption and mandatory key escrow?
If we had the proper figures to work with then we could make a valid
judgment as to how many lives anti-GAK supporters would have to put
in danger in order to tip the balance so that it would be in the best
interests of the citizens to allow strong non-GAK'ed crypto.
I, for one, would hate to see lives lost needlessly merely because those opposing GAK did not have the proper figures to work with.
I think that in the interests of the greatest number of citizens, the government should supply solid figures as to the body count that would
be required to negate the need for laws against strong encryption.
Also, the government should provide a separate figure for how many lives of legislators would need to be lost in order to balance the
threat of strong encryption. I imagine that it would take far fewer
Congressman's lives to balance it out than it would average citizen's
Call your Congressman and ask if these figures are available.
In order to get the most help possible, begin the conversation by
asking the Congressman if he is in favor of saving lives.

You should be careful before you do foolish things like making a death
threat because it can have really bad results. It can make people really nervous and think maybe they should get
you first. Sometimes they hire other people to get you before you get
them�really bad people sometimes. Sometimes even bad people who
act like they are good people and fool everyone until they kill you.
Which brings me to the point I am trying to make:
You should not try to kill the Constitution any more because there is
not enough left to make people safe and they might get really nervous
and think maybe they should get you first�or even after. For revenge.
People like the Constitution a lot and if you are making a death threat
against it then it is like saying your going to kill someone else�s
friend or family and everyone knows that they will kill you because they are domestic and not a stranger.  Or is it that they are stranger and not domesticated?
Never mind. You know what I mean. Especially if you try to make it so that they cannot put aluminum foil
hats on their thoughts and their words and their writing. Then they get really, really, nervous and maybe start thinking that they have to
kill everybody because they are not safe from anybody. You should be careful if you find yourself walking next to someone
whistling that Crosby Stills & Nash song "If you cant kill the one you
love�then kill the one you�re with." (� That�s a joke but it would
be really funny if you took it serious and whacked someone out for
whistling it anyway.) (Its not like they have a Constitutional right to
whistle it or anything....hee, hee.)
You should be careful before you vote to kill the Constitution and look
under all your chairs and stuff, just in case. You should maybe look in
your conscience too and see if you are not a bad person maybe. You
should also maybe look in a mirror and make sure you are not cross
eyed and that there is nobody beside you whistling that song "If looks
could kill�then you would only be hurting yourself."(<== that's a joke.)
Even if you do think you can kill the Constitution and still have all of
the people believe you are not a bad person then you should at least
try not to let really stupid people who you work with say things like
"I am too stupid to learn about this stuff so I am going to let the guys
who want to make aluminum foil hats illegal and put everyone in jail
decide how I vote to kill the Constitution."
The one those guys who always say "Nuke DC" call Swinestein said
that and it made everyone think you are all that stupid and going to
let people with guns who kill women and children make your votes
for you. Then even more of them say "Nuke DC" especially when they
remember how bad the guys with the guns that you are letting vote for
you fucked their friend (sorry but thats what they did) for making a stink with the IRS.
That is really all I am trying to say. Is that you should be careful
that you dont kill so much of the Constitution and let the guys with the guns screw so many people that nobody feels safe from them anymore
because they wont just get nervous about them they will get nervous
about you too because you promised to protect them and didnt.
Just try to remember that it never ends.
If you take away some of the guns from people then you have to take
away all the guns or you are in big trouble. If you take away some of
the Constitution from people then you have to take away all of the
Constitution or you are in big trouble.
Even if you think you took away all of the things that people can use
to be safe and free then they will make more�like Doritos. If you try to kill them with bullshit then they will try to kill you
with their own brand of fertilizer. If you take away their aluminum foil hats then they will make hats out of paper and call them Forever Young.
Killing the Constitution is a lot like killing DC�if your going to do
it then you might as well do it right and do it all at once.
Guys with guns who want to kill Freeh-dumb know that and so do
guys with nukes who are Freeh-dumb fighters. (My uncle made up a
new word about him�he said he "testiLies to Congress.")
Don�t be a stranger,
p.s - If you see Declan McCullagh getting in his car and driving like
hell away from the city then you should get in your car and do the same thing. You dont need to pack a suitcase because I think if he
does that then there is already one packed.
(Thats what the guys with guns told you in your secret meetings so you will kill the Constitution for them isnt it?)
p.p.s.- If you hear someone say "President Freeh" then do not wait for
Declan just get the hell out of there real fast anyway. You can come to my place if you want and help me send out secret aluminum foil
hats. (Bring a whoopee cushion and we will make little funny booms
instead of big scary ones. We are a little more laid back out here in

the carpet all that easily is annoying our paid hit men and
taking up their time."
Translation: "Distributing completely factual and accurate
information about the powers of jurors to thwart our use of
bad laws."
Translation: "Using the bad-awful-whipping-boy Internet to
promote the idea that public officials be held ultimately
accountable for their actions. Only one or two people of the 250 million or so in the U.S. actually suggested such
accountability but it's such a great scare tactic that we
are going to hold it up as an example of how evil any of
the other 249,999,998 are who resist total overnment in
any way."
Court TV (and its non-televised equivalents all over the
country) doesn't count, I suppose. The government filing
false claims against citizen-units for money they don't
actually owe doesn't count, I suppose.
Translation: "We are laying the groundwork to be able to pile
more charges on those we single out for suppression. Anyone
who is prosecuted for political reasons will, in the future,
also be prosecutable for ever having requested any information
of any court, government agency or elected official, just as
we now pile gratuitous 'mail fraud' and 'wire fraud' charges
onto most of the hapless victims of the criminal federal
just-us system. Or is that 'federal criminal justice system?' It's so darn hard to keep all these lies straight."
So can tell-tale signs of ass-wipe would-be tyrants, but that's another memo altogether.

A legal term found in any law dictionary.
A reference to some part of the Uniform Commercial Code.
Terrorism can now consist of citing existing law. Great.
Defending onesself now earns the classification of "terrorism."
Acting of one's own rightm possessing full social and civil
rights, not being under any civil disability or power of another or guardianship, having the capacity to manage one's
own affairs... is now "terrorism?"
Since we have to presume that she is not prepared to sacrifice
these legal terms for her own use we have to think that this
is a redefinition of what is politically correct for a citizen-
unit to write in his own legal documents.
United States? As a common noun? Trying to demonize that one
is a dangerous ploy for bureaucrats and politicians who are
themselves largely functionally illiterate. "Make a mistake
in capitalization or punctuation and GO TO JAIL!" God, wouldn't your 5th grade spinster teacher, Miss Anderson, have just LOVED that? "Johnny, fail this weekly quiz and you're going
to the slammer for a month! Beverly, you're going to get the
chair if you go down for the third time!"
Oh dear! The common everyday law dictionary. Of course only
nincompoop resisters quote Black's. Real Lawyers (tm) cite
case law, not dictionaries, because they've been let in on
the Great Secret (tm) that "law comes from the bench." No wonder we're in such trouble! We've been electing the wrong
asswipes all this time! We've been electing legislators,
thinking they make the law, when we should have been electing
judges. Geez.
Maybe that's because it's true.
Traditional political reform seems to mean "no political
reform." At least that's what it has meant all through
MY lifetime.
Sadly, there is probably a rapidly increasing number of
ordinary citizen-units coming to this conclusion. To
understand why, all one must do is watch the government.
Nice try! We've been to college, have we? We've taken
Psych 101, have we? We fancy ourselves adept at Psychwar,
do we?

(Part 1 of 7)
The latest spin document on resistance to tyranny from The
People's Democratic Republic of Washington requires some
translation to be understood by normal human beings:
A contradiction in terms if there ever was one. "paper
terrorism," to be a meaningful term, would have to be
something like the dropping of 500 lb. bundles of paper
on unsuspecting, innocent people. "Terrorism" means
violent attacks on the populace to instill fear and
uncertainty. Unless someone is killing people with
paper, the subject of this document is pure propaganda.
It is interesting that "they" can only think in terms of
"organizations." It may not dawn on them until it is too
late that the future is one of individual action. No
meetings to spy on. No informants. No membership lists or memos to seize.
"Called?" Called by whom? By government? Notice that this
is an example of the definition of a new term to suit those
attempting to suppress opposition. It is a standard tactic.
Note that there seems to be a key admission in the previous sentence. She seems to be saying that the tactics she is about to describe actually work.
See various works on the history of the American Revolution
for perspective.
I thought that those frivolous systems of the government
were already overburdened by "normal" business. So now thay wish to suppress those whose politics they don't
like by classifying their communications, business,
court petitions, liens and small claims actions as not
only frivolous, but "terrorism." Interesting.
Note that "Intelligence" in law enforcement means keeping
files and lists of names. It means prejudicing victims in
subsequent actions and proceedings. It means targeting
victims for their efforts at 1st Amendment expression and
defending themselves in administrative and judicial

Translation: "We think we have a really, really clever
protoargument here for nullifying the right to peaceably
assemble. If we can characterize the resisters as nut
cases we can make the argument that they cannot be allowed
the right to assemble because they reinforce each other's
illness. Isn't that neat-o?"
Translation: "Just as happened in the 1770's. We can't have anything like THAT happening here and now, can we? That was THEN, this is NOW! SHUT UP and SIT DOWN!"
She never mentioned "Paper Terrorism" perpetrated by government
agencies, did she? Would anyone care to hazard a guess as to
the relative magnitude of government victimizing citizen-units
vs citizen-units snapping at the heels of government by means of the tactics she lists above?  1,000-to-1?  100,000-to-1?
Karen's definition of what constitutes "Paper Terrorism" is,
basically, anything in the way of communication, court pleadings, cases, liens, etc. that the government doesn't like. If she wants to fly with a subjective definition then
she can't very well argue against the subjective view of
citizen-units who feel they are being terrorized by numerous
and multitudinous, often false or frivolous communications,
court pleadings, suits, charges, liens, seizures, convictions,
sentences, fines, etc. Their subjective views are at least as
valid as Karen's or the government's.
(She's an elected ass-wipe, but she's OUR elected ass-wipe!
If we want to elect someone on the Totalitarian ticket, that's
our right. There's no law that says a Representative has to
represent our interests.)

Translation: "There are signs the resistance is growing and
becoming widespread."
As if the other requests they would like to be handling are
not meaningless? Let's face it: Except as it provides them
job security, bureaucrats regard all requests of any kind
from citizen-units as meaningless, consumptive of time and
disruptive of schedules. Nor can a government that is
increasingly jailing its citizen-units and seizing their
property without just cause or due process make even a
thin claim to be concerned about "the private sector."
Translation: "Last-ditch attempts to make officials accountable
for their tyrranical actions. When citizen-units have been
outrageously damaged by unaccountable officials they sometimes
resort to filing liens against those responsible."
Translation: "Lawsuits with which those in power disagree." If it doesn't muss their hair they could care less if you sue someone for serving you hot coffee that's advertized as hot coffee or sue the manufacturer of a machine that has passed through 30 years of ownership and maintenance of dozens of third parties just because you were stupid enough to put your fingers in the gears. But sue a bureaucrat for being stupid, arrogant, abusive, vindictive and destructive of your rights and watch out! That's FRIVOLOUS! Apparently it's also now "terrorism."
Translation: "Devising well-researched instruments such as Public Order Money Certificates, payable the very moment lawful money is put back into circulation." She would have us think that resisters are out there writing bad checks, something only the government is allowed to do with impunity.
Homemade? That's cute. Various common law entities have been created by various folk in the last 10-15 years in desperate
attempts to put SOMETHING in place that would function
lawfully and constitutionally. A few of those have been on the fringe, and those are the only ones that will ever be
cited as examples, of course. Never mind that all the townships and other little political units all over the
country were formed pretty much the same way. "That was
THEN and this is NOW and WE ARE IN CHARGE!  SHUT UP and SIT DOWN!" Don't you love government as we head into the 21st
Century, the century which will see the final extinguishing
of the light of freedom if people don't get off their asses
and do something?
