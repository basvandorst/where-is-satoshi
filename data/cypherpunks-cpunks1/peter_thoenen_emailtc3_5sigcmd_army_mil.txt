@_subject: The Freest Country? 
Actually, the US tax issue doesn't care where you live / work / reside /
domicile, that's the problem.  The US is one of the FEW countries that taxes
it citizens regardless of where you live in the world and / or if you are
additional paying taxes to foreign governments (since you live / work
there).  Only bonus you get living outside the US is the first $80K USD is
tax-free (federal and state, not FICA (which is paid at 15% since you count
as self-employed for tax purposes regardless if you work for a foreign
company)).  The US looks at it as a kind of future benefits tax.  You have
NOT given up your US citizenship so obviously one day you do plan to return
and live in the US (regardless of truth or not).  The taxes you pay while
you are not here will support the federal benefits and infrastructure you
receive when you do one day decide to return to the US and live.
While one could argue you could not report / misreport the monies you made
while working / living in a foreign country, that is tax evasion and
something the feds don't take kindly to (especially if you bring yourself
back to the states to live / visit).  Its not as if you can keep it under
the table either, your entry / exit records at the US border are kept file.
Kind of suspicious not making *ANY* money in the years you lived overseas,
raises an eyebrow or two with the IRS.
Additional, you are not authorized to declare you have no intention to ever
returning to the US live (some states allow you to declare this is writing
making you exempt from ALL state taxes).
Your options are:
1.  Keep US citizenship, pay FICA (and taxes +$80K USD)
2.  Keep US citizenship, misreport taxes, risk tax evasion.
3.  Pay US taxes until you establish residency in another nation.  Official
surrender your US citizenship.
4.  Immediately surrender your US citizenship (before gaining residency in
another nation).  You official become a 'stateless person (UN)'.  Risky boat
to be in.
While 3 looks to be the best choice, nice things about being a citizen of
the sole superpower is:
1.  Can always go back to the US, its relatively stable.
2.  US State Dept. honestly does care and try to help US citizens living in
foreign countries (even today).
3.  US Passport is a gateway to anywhere, very very few visa requirements.
Nice thing to have.
So for us who never plan to return to the US it comes down to money, just
how much is our US Citizenship worth to us.  Is that passport / legal status
worth the yearly fee required.  Its a question we all must ask ourselves.

 >>SOP.  Happened during the Yugo thang too.
On a semi related side note, how long has this guy been in (total length of
service)?  All personnel
when they join the US Military are quite clearly informed they have an 8-year
commitment, regardless
of how long their initial enlistment is.  If your initial commitment is less
than 8 years, you are
moved into the Inactive Ready Reserve (IRR) for the remainder of the 8 years.
(E.g. you enlist for 4
years active or ready reserve (weekend warriors); you will also spend 4 years
in IRR).
While in the IRR you have no requirements other than to keep the government
informed of your current
contact information.  You have no drills and receive no benefits.  The US
Government though reserves
the right to call you up at whim any time during this period.  I am curious if
this person is still
within his 8-year commitment even though he completed his initial commitment.
If he is still within
this 8 year window, he doesnt have a leg to stand on nor my sympathy.
On that same note, any weekend warrior who complains about being activated has
no sympathy from me.
  Take the devils coin, be prepared to do his work also.  The few folk that
have my sympathy are
those IRR folk that have be activated.  I have a couple IRR buddies who
haven't so much as thought
about the military in years all of a sudden get activated for Iraq, now thats
something to complain
about.  4 years active, 3 years smoking dope in college, then a call from the
good old us army
ordering you to report to your IRR unit within 48 hours and go to Iraq.  Those
are the folk I feel
sorry for.  They did their time, got out, and didn't continue to take the
devils coin ever 4th weekend.

 >>It hasn't, it only requires males to register.  So far.

How is that for some equally rights.  Women continue to whine and cry that
they are being
discriminated against in the military as the military refused to open up
certain all male MOS's (18
and 11 series to name a couple) yet I don't see them hounding congress for the
equal right to be
drafted.  Nothing like having your cake and getting to eat it to.

That is the same logic I use to justify to myself working as a defense contractor.  The amount uncle sam will pay me in my lifetime is greater than or equal to the amount I will ever actually pay him in taxes.  I win in the long run :)

" U.S. occupation troops are spread so thin in Kosovo,.....Kosovo...not our problem"
Having spent the better part of last year working in Kosovo, I wouldn't exactly call the forces there thin.  NATO forces (non-US) are a majority of the peacekeeping occupiers and more and more of the mission is getting turned over to the EU (allowing for slow US withdrawal).  With Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia eagerly sucking the EU and US cocks to get into the EU and NATO, the US in the Balkans is if anything over strength.  Of course hard line nationalists could take advantage of the overextended US forces, but honestly not likely to happen.  Recent history (after the Cold War) seems to suggest that whole "Enemy of my enemy is my friend" concept doesn't work when the US is that enemy.  Time and time again the enemies of the US (or folk who are not our enemies but also know the US would prevent them from doing sovereign things such as invading Taiwan) never seem to coordinate among themselves to take advantage of the situation.  World wide terrorist cells seem to be pretty good at it but they also direct their energies at multiple targets, not just the USA (e.g. the IRA/PLA/FARC all cross train with each other and use each others specialists from time to time but all have 3 concentrate on different local enemies).  Hostile foreign governments though just can't seem to band together.
What Bush didn't realize at the time (and now the US Media is whining about) is that countries that didn't support him during the war would also not support him after the war.  His hostile foreign diplomacy before the Iraq puppet state (pissing off two of the three largest Non-US peacekeeping forces (France / Germany)) is forcing the US to provide nearly all of the Iraq occupation force instead of handing it off to our *allies* as we have in the past.  The standard US occupation plan for the last 12 years has been Invade->Conquer->Hand off ~70% of peacekeeping to other countries. This just isn't going to work this time and Bush in his arrogance can't understand why.  Even Kosovo (NATO action, UN did NOT approve) got UN support immediately following the end of hostilities.  Bush doesn't even seem to be trying to garner support for a postfacto UN resolution on Iraq giving in the air of legitimacy.

@_subject: Well it looks like pigs can now force you to incriminate 
For your enjoyment.
CNN writeup seems to suggest that police no longer need to inform you of your rights (Miranda) and warn you against self incrimination.  While the justices state this ruling does not condone law enforcement abuses to force your to incriminate yourself, we all know how easily abuse is covered up or just blatantly ignored.
"But justices also concluded the suspect may be able to collect damages because his due process rights were violated during a hospital room interrogation. That part of the ruling was sent back to a lower federal court for further consideration."
Does this even need to get reported, we all know how the lower court will rule, no damages.
It seems the government finally feels it no longer needs to at least keep up the pretense of a fair and civil society.

Yes.  The Jews knew what was happening which is why the rich, smart, and

@_subject: Current Operational Nodes? 
Cross posting on multiple nodes since none seem reliable.
Now that LNE is shutting down ... are there actually any other reliable
operational nodes?  Have subscribed to minder.net, algebra.com, and ds.pro-ns.net all in the last two weeks to no avail.  Some return subscribed message but never forward actual traffic (just spam).  Think I actually got one or two operational messages from algebra but thats it.
Do we want another node?  I can throw one up if wanted / needed /
trusted (being a contractor for 'the man' and all such bullshit jazz) or do we just want to let this list die?  Not a big fan of newsgroups.
If wanted, will host offsite on a non-gov commercial server.  Personal politics aside, its an enjoyable list to lurk on :)
