Magnesium seawater battery - its pretty much bronze age techmology -
Can melt down
alloy car wheels for a start. Otherwise AZ61 alloy is hardly a controlled
substance. Only other thing you need is  twisted wire titanium brushes with
carbon fiber bristles. Easily made in some South Asian sweatshop, with
barely a record kept.
The electronics is the tricky stuff, but once you get the first one working,
replicating to 1000s is easy enough. Again, south asian sweatshops, or
buying a middle tier chinese RC toy maker isnt out of reach for the South
American combinas.

These guys have a magnesium seawater powered UUV and are getting a 3600km

An this is decade old
Some stone age forest dwelling crack zombies could surely bang out something
half as efficient, right?
