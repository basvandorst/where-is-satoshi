@_subject: "Cipher" 
An online definition (telnet chem.ucsd.edu, login webster)
supports Postman, although it only goes back to Arabic:
Word: cipher
[ME, fr. MF cifre, fr. ML cifra, fr. Ar s.ifr empty, cipher, zero]
1a: ZERO 1a
1b: one that has no weight, worth, or influence: NONENTITY
2a: a method of transforming a text in order to conceal its meaning --
    compare CODE 3b
2b: a message in code
3: ARABIC NUMERAL
4: a combination of symbolic letters; esp: the interwoven initials of a name
                [verb defs -- "to cipher" -- deleted]
I'll refrain from smartass comments about 1b as it relates to all of us...:-)

I read mail and news offline, but preprocess mail from this list and
the IMP list by using Berkely mail to quickly scan message headers
and delete mail from CERTAIN PEOPLE before downloading.  Since there
are some useful posts from penet.fi, and Detweiler uses different
"names," I find the phrase "an ID that will live in infamy" mnemonically
useful in zapping his rants as quickly as possible.
Interesting coincidence that his ID corresponds to a major date in
the history of cryptography...he'd probably regard it as Divine
Confirmation of his Messianic role...:-)
Happy Holidays,

@_subject: AUTOPGP 
It's at oak.oakland.edu (and, presumably, all mirror sites) as:
I use both Yarn and AutoPGP; each has different strengths.  I find that
for Internet use Yarn meets almost all my needs, but AutoPGP comes in
very handy for occasional use, mainly with QWK packets from bbs's.
BTW, signing and/or verifying email and Usenet posts is a snap for me,
so I'm pretty indifferent to the recent debates here.  But -- as usual with
public-key crypto -- key management is the rub:  I don't want to snarf
all ~6,000 keys from the servers, nor to grab keys piecemeal via email/
who's not currently in my key ring.  I could, of course, just continue to
ignore signatures, but Eric's proposal may turn into quite an interesting
experiment, judging from the responses thus far. :-)
Has anyone considered setting up a site where only folks on this list could
store and retrieve keys?  Perhaps a single file containing keys for the
hundred or so active posters that could be ftp'd and stored as a secondary
key ring...cpunkeys.pgp or whatever.  I'd really prefer to keep my main
key ring small so that access is quick (well...semi-quick).

Bruce Schneier's (excellent!) book states that the only info available to
someone cryptanalyzing a pgp-encrypted file is the six-digit key ID.  PEM
"leaves quite a bit of information about the sender, recipient, and message
in the unencrypted header."  (p. 436)

@_subject: Kragen == LD? 
The Alliance for Bandwidth Conservation (ABC), asked me to point out:
LD> I don't have a voice without them. My Nyx account would be
LD> censored immediately from your screeching complaints if I didn't
LD> post through them!
LD's account is anon???? (? = hex digit).  This is the
first I knew of this, but it doesn't surprise me -- Nyx is a public
access site at the University of Denver.   And please don't all
mailbomb his overworked sysadmin (who volunteers his time to run Nyx),
right away.  LD's been fairly mild lately, compared to last Nov-Dec.  I
think it suffices for him to know that this will occur if he becomes
abusive -- damn surprised he mentioned Nyx, in fact!  His sysadmin
*can* correlate anon accounts with True Names, if necessary.
btw, anyone can telnet there and read the list gated as newsgroup
mail.cypherpunks.  You'll have to jump through some hoops to be able
to post from there, though.
Sigh...awaiting the (awestrop = Detweiler?) thread,

@_subject: XSplit & N/M alternatives 
I just glanced at the .doc and ran it once last night on my PC -- haven't
looked at the source -- but a possible application of this occurred to me
this morning.  The N files are binary, but it should be easy to restrict
them to ASCII using a command-line switch or a file for PRNG input, right?
Then they would be suitable for Internet (re)mailing.  (Concerns about
cryptographic integrity are irrelevant for my purposes.)
A remailer could receive, say, a 5k message, which might be ~4.5k after
peeling off that remailer's layer of encryption.  XSPLIT could then be
invoked to produce several ASCII files of identical size.  These bogus
files could be mailed to various remailers at the same time as the "real"
file, with a prepended instruction to send 'em to the bit bucket.  Of
course, latency would then have to be added before processing the "real"
file to defeat traffic analyis.  I'm probably missing something, but
it's a thought anyway...

someone point out the procedure for asking Julf to delete my account in

@_subject: Keep Out--The Journal of Electronic Privacy 
Odd, but my copy of the Constitution (w/amendments) doesn't even contain
the word "privacy," let alone any mention of a "right to privacy."  (*Damn*
these variorum editions!)  There is the Fourth Amendment, of course, but
the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures is not
synonymous with the right to privacy, IMO.
I believe it was in Katz v. U.S. (1967) that the Supreme Court first
enunciated the doctrine of a "reasonable expectation of privacy."  It's
interesting that it took the advent of telecommunications to bring this
issue to the fore -- Katz was a wiretapping case.  Of course,

@_subject: who? 
Regrettably, it appears jpunix.com is down permanently.  I can't fault John
at all, and want to thank him for running a robust remailer for as long as
he was able.  I captured this earlier today:
Newsgroups: alt.privacy.anon-server,alt.anonymous
Organization: J. P. and Associates
In article ,
Here is the test of a message I sent to remailer-operators:
The anonymous remailer at jpunix.com is going to shut down permanently shortly after I send this message. I spent my holidays fighting spams, running out of disk space because of spams and people sending HUGE binaries, and running out of swap space.
I have come to the ultimate conclusion that the Internet is not
mature or developed enough for remailers. The intended purpose has been
completely ignored while abuse is growing almost geometrically on a daily
basis. I have concluded that running a remailer on the Internet is like
giving a bunch of terrorists a nuclear bomb and then telling them "But
only use it for good!". There just doesn't seem to be much point in
thrashing my disks and computer to aid somebody in net abuse. I hardly
ever (never) see any use of the remailer for the purposes it was intended. BTW as I type this, mailgate.mail.aol.com is hammering my port 25 every 30 seconds. The contents of the spam being passed thru my system essentially says:
          THIS IS A MAIL BOMB!!

Ah, yes, I wish I were "(c) Both of the above" -- as the Sinatra lyric

I think generalizing about "Wired" is like generalizing about the NY
Times, where Markoff and Lewis arguably exemplify the best and worst
of mainstream computer/telecom journalism.  "Wired" has many flaws, but
I consider Steven Levy's articles about Cypherpunks, Whitfield Diffie,
and digital cash to be among the best expositions of Cypherpunk issues
for the layperson.  (Kelly's "Whole Earth Review" piece is another.)
I can forgive some faults in return for seeing Levy's non-technical
explanations of public-key crypto and the Dining Cryptographers protocol
in successive issues. :-)

I don't have the text of Lance's response available at the moment, but
I believe he clearly stated that he would not block remailings to the
mail-to-news gateways.  I.e., while he's complying with the letter of the
Co$ request, his remailers can still be used effectively for anonymous
posting.  Other than a slight delay in posting, I can't think of any
inconvenience this imposes on those wishing to post anonymously.
I thought it was an excellent response.  /* nudge, wink, etc. :-) */
