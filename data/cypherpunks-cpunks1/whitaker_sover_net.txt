@_subject: whose watchin the watchers 
The following is an exerpt is from Jim Warren's listserv, GovAccess 183.
Are there folks on this list who have insights or definitive information on
this topic?
Are there ways for someone with access to modify router tables to constantly
create alternate paths at other routers which would serve to end-around any
such snoops?
Is Someone Already Watching All International Net Traffic?
The following is the transcript of an actual communications trace that a
friend ran, while I was sitting next to him, watching -- reprinted here
with his permission.
He did a "traceroute" of two messages that he sent from his machine in
Switzerland (he'd telneted into it while we were at a computer conference
in California).
Traceroute automatically reports each Internet node through which a message
passes, as it proceeds from origin to destination.
He did two traceroutes.  The first was from Switzerland to an addressee at
Netcom in San Jose, California.  The second was from Switzerland to an
addressee in Israel.

OK folks, nobody seems to have any ideas how to keep our little state of
Vermont from falling prey to mediocrity in the internet. I thought with so
many highly opinionated people I would at least get a few good or at least
entertaining suggestions.
How about a different angle. Can anyone aid in building capacity among a few
sincere watchdog types to really learn how to map, trace and test the net
here as it grows?
What constitutes a basic toolkit for trace route, sniff for promiscuous
mode, all the other tools to map whats happening to net traffic in a little
state of 1/2 million people? What are the sources of traffic information?
With there not even a single DS-3 in the state yet carrying IP it seems we
just might have a prayer of doing it right, whatever that is. What would it
look like if secure communications and anonomynity were designed in from the
start? Is this what Sameer is doing in Bezerkeley?
What machines are considered minimum requirements to use these tools? What
are the essential reference works?

@_subject: Electronic-reply issues 
[Key Words: public records; privacy; encryption; archives;
Telecommunications Plan;]
November 7, 1995
Mr. Geoffrey Commons Esq.
Special Counsel
Vermont Department of Public Service
State Street
Montpelier, Vermont 05602
Dear Mr. Commons:
Thank you for your prompt reply to my document request.
Yes, I will accept your electronic correspondence as your 'written' reply.
However, this brings up several good points which I would ask that you
follow up on:
The receipt of an e-mail message does not, in and of itself, assure the
recipient of the messages' authenticity, privacy or preservation. On the authentication issue, it is well known that the message headers are
absolutely insufficient to authenticate the sender of a message. Digital
technologies, using encryption, are required here. Other issues are the
privacy of the message along it's long path between your desk and my office,
and the records later availability,  _in electronic format_, if requested. Regardless of the fact that we work only a thousand feet apart here in
Montpelier, this message has probably traversed, _in clear text_, through
Hartford CT., Albany NY., or Boston MA. prior to being exchanged between the
so called 'gov-net' and sover.net. Your reply has also probably been backed
up to a tape at the DPS, combined with other exempt public records dealing
with current regulatory litigation or consumer complaints. These storage
procedures, or lack thereof, could serve to impede future access to these
and other records by the public.
The original voice mail request and it's written reply take on some form of
public records status where, by statute, records must be cataloged so as to
be locatable if requested, and archived for a certain period of time
pursuant to an approved records retention schedule. Those schedules are
approved by the director of public records, John Yacavoni.
It occurs to me that the DPS is required under the Vermont statutes
governing the preparation of a Ten Year Telecommunications Plan, to analyze
telecommunications  technologies and the implication of their use in both
the public and private arenas. The pertinent parts of the statute are
included here for your convenience.
30 VSA 202d
                       *        *       *
        >(b)  The department, through the director, shall prepare a
telecommunications plan for the state.  The plan shall be for a 10 year
period and shall serve as a basis for state telecommunications policy.  The
plan shall include at a minimum:
development as they relate to future requirements for telecommunications
services, including patterns of urban expansion, statewide and service area
economic growth, shifts in transportation modes, economic development,
technological advances and other trends and factors which, as determined by
the director, will significantly affect state telecommunications policy and
cooperation with the agency of development and community affairs, to
determine what telecommunications services are needed now and in the
succeeding ten years;
by the board;
evaluation of alternative proposals for upgrading the system to provide the
best available and affordable technology for use by government.
policies and goals of section 202c of this title, and the need for basic
service at affordable rates, improved competition among providers, the needs
of the state as user of telecommunications services, and future development
of the state.
It would then logically follow that a thorough analysis of these issues,
which are not created by, but are certainly complicated by
telecommunications technologies, should be included in the forthcoming Draft
of that plan. The department would then offer the citizens and the business
community an opportunity to recommend changes or elaboration on those draft
recommendations. These should include, but are not limited to the use of
digital signatures, authentication and encryption technologies, and last but
not least EDI or Electronic Document Interchange.
These technologies are relevant to the state as a whole as far as
positioning our citizens and businesses to participate in the rapidly
emerging era of electronic commerce (where absolute privacy protections are
essential), but are also immediately relevant to the gov-net/ school-net
implementation, and even to the workings of your Department of Public
Service and the quasi-judicial Public Service Board in order to enable
electronic filings, to expedite the backlog of dockets and to answer
official document requests.
As far as I know there is no other working group addressing these issues at
present. Possibly your 'written' reply to my public records request,
delivered via e-mail, will serve to catalyze such an effort in the context
of a PSB-DPS working group (open to the public, of course) or in one of the
amazingly effective forums in which your commissioner participates dealing
with telecommunications.
One more question: was the voice mail message which I delivered to you,
which certainly constitutes a record "created or acquired in the course of
agency business", retained, cataloged and archived? Or, if it was destroyed,
was it pursuant to an approved records retention schedule? I recall the
voice mail message to your Commissioner relating the Clyde River Dam
negotiations which prompted a headline story and wish to emphasize the
relevance of these new technologies and the management of public records.
I look forward to your thoughtful reply, or that of your Commissioner,
Richard Sedano.
Now aren't you glad you use e-mail?

Thanks, Daniel, for a thoughtful response.
I didn't mean to suggest that government would be responsible to get it right.
It is possible to show them how it's done though.
This is good as it can be pitched as economic development. Any good models?
Where to find the UTAH language? Pitfalls to watch out for?
This will probably be tough in the current environment. Again, any good
language available? Fortunately Vermont is small enough where anyone can get
a bill printed and introduced if it is properly drafted.
What did the recent US Supreme court decide in support of anonymity?
Now were getting specific. These are things that us ordinary folk can do
which show the 'leaders' how to follow. What software, hardware,
applications, support and sysadmin experience is required and where is it
available on what terms. What are the cash flow opportunities to support
such services?
Agreed. That why after five or six years of trying to get the privacy laws
passed, and watching government drag anchor, I started fishin the
cypherpunks list for some pragmatic solutions to everyday situations.
I'd still like to be pointed to some toolkits/reference works which will
teach me how to access and use available information (or data) to map the
net performance, message paths, transmission delay times, sniffers active, etc.

@_subject: nym-compoop 
I'm glad "nobody" thinks I'm a nym for being a good eight hours:fifty-nine
minutes out of step and having lowered my reputation in his/her eyes. Now
I'll ask my question again, which apparantly got lost in the collective
groan of my stale post:
        Are there ways for someone with access to modify router tables         to constantly create alternate paths at other routers         which would serve to end-around any such snoops?
This question is now offered in the context of the _hypothetical_situation_
of there being snoops out here in the first place. Later I'll ask about
sniffing for sniffers.
One reason for this post is the fact that certain ambitious bureaucrats here
in Vermont have decided to build, own and control the internet, connecting
governments, schools and a few businesses. There is no encryption in use by
the government agencies and they have let the school hackers and teachers on
now to share the T-1 backbone with the state agencies and contractors
(medicaid/EDS) carrying personal information collected and managed by state
government. These [ir]responsible parties refuse to provide any documentation requested
under public records law demonstrating that a security plan or practice is
in place. The high schools are offered 56K circuits for $5K/annual and a
share of a gov'ment network manager who wont answer his e-mail and doesn't
know where to begin looking for copies of it, when it too is requested under
our public records laws. Our governor stated in his address to the legislature that these 56K lines
will let an "unlimited number of students access the internet
simultaneously". Anybody got a bridge?
I sure would like to hear from some folks who would be willing to aid in
paying close attention, discussing the implications and appropriateness of
encryption technologies for this situation, aiding in testing for sniffers,
etc. This request is offered as an attempt to keep a step ahead of the
public/private competition, privacy accident-waiting-to-happen and the
surveillance potential/practice of such a beast.
If someone who feels strongly that this is off-topic for this list makes
that case I'll carry my inquiry elsewhere, after a little cross-fire, of
course. I even went back and just now read the "Welcome to" message to see
whether these issues fall withih the scope.
I can hardly find anyone who even cares about the fact that our legislature
relies on the executive branch gov-net managers for their port/connection on
the internet router. They also rely on the executive branch for
troubleshooting their novell LAN. Does anyone else see a separation of
powers issue or privacy issue here? Note that I cc: the speaker, who cares
but doesn't yet grasp the implications. Feel free to write him directly. His
name is Michael Obuchowski, Obe for short, , tell
him I sent you.
At this point offering encryption software to school age kids is a whole lot
easier than convincing bureaucrats that it's a good practice. This wont
solve the problem of poor practice by government though. Unfortunately this
will also likely frighten the school network techies, administrators and
school board members.
Anybody have a copy of any good, tight, discovery orders which can be useful
in gaining court ordered access to prevent destruction of evidence and for
combing the electronic files and e-mail of these accountable public servants
to demonstrate that they don't know what there doing? (responses to the
legal points by private e-mail please. Do I come across as litigious?)
The Boston Globe did a good front page story a week or ten days ago entitled
"e-mail as evidence". Mostly the story was relating to lawyers and
consultants making big money aiding corporations to assure that the really
damaging, unencrypted e-mail is thoroughly scrubbed from all systems.
Back to where this started:
Eating my tasty crow gives rise to another question relating to the timing
and continuity of these threads: How did the first responder on the RE:
134.222.9.1, Simon Spero, reply at 10:48 pm on Nov. 4 to Anonymous' posting
of 7:19AM on Nov 5? Which way is this thing spinnin?
