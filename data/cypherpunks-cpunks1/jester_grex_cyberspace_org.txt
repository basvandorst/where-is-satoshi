altering either the bar code or the mag strip on the back of my license
would be as illegal as say changing the picture (Not that this is possible
in with the new NY licenses).  I do not know the legality behind this but
I am aware that altering a license in ANYWAY is illegal.  Although what
you are suggesting is VERY difficult to prove, it is still I would think
illegal.  Unless anyone has any legal information to the contrary....
their license also have fines for non-oprative strips.  If they do not, I
am sure the law will be created so enough!

@_subject: Accounts... 
This brings up an interesting point to which I have been trying to create
a person list myself.  Certain systems out there offer Free account to
anyone without any sort of identity check.. I have only found a couple
myself and all of them seem to limit access to News and ftp unless you
send them money...  However I am still looking for these computers which
seem to offer the best anonymous access to anyone...  Could you please
e-mail me ANY sights that offer free/cheap internet access via telnet that
do not check id?
