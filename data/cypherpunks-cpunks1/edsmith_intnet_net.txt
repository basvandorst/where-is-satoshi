Disarm the BATF                    Another day, another debacle for the Bureau of
                   Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.                    This time, the scene is not Waco, Texas, or Ruby Ridge,
                   Idaho, but Taft, California -- another hotbed of
                   "anti-government activity."                    According to the federal government's own account, the
                   BATF began an investigation into illegal firearms sales
                   by people espousing anti-government rhetoric three or
                   four years ago with an undercover agent allegedly
                   making an illegal purchase of a .22-caliber pistol.                    It ended last week with one of the three targets of the
                   federal government probe dead in a highly unusual --
                   and, yes, improbable -- incident.                    The official story goes something like this: Two BATF
                   agents, a Kern County sheriff's deputy and Sgt. Ed
                   Whiting of the Taft Police Department attempted to
                   take into custody on illegal firearms trafficking charges,
                   Darryl Howell, a 45-year-old grandfather and owner of
                   a surplus store that sold, among other things, guns and
                   ammunition.                    A struggle between the BATF agents and Howell
                   ensued. The cops say he broke away from them, lunged
                   for a .45-caliber handgun, put it into his mouth and fired
                   a single shot. Whiting, the story goes, had become
                   temporarily distracted during the scuffle. When he
                   heard the single shot, he instinctively aimed his gun at
                   Howell and fired three more shots into his already,
                   presumably, lifeless body.                    Now, if you believe that, I have an intercontinental
                   ballistic missile I'd like to sell you.                    I'm not a cop, and I've never played one on TV. But I
                   have reported on enough crime stories in my day to
                   know when one stinks to high heaven. And this one
                   smells like a cattle ranch on a windless, summer day in
                   California's Central Valley.                    Let me see if I have this straight. Four cops, one
                   "suspect." This wanted outlaw -- so dangerous he's
                   been under scrutiny of federal law enforcement for
                   nearly four years -- is confronted not in his home, not on
                   his lunch break, not on his way to work or after he locks
                   up, but during the workday in a store loaded with
                   firearms. Even though he's not accused of being on
                   PCP or any other drugs, he cannot be physically
                   subdued by four officers. They are unable to persuade
                   him to come along peacefully or handcuff him
                   involuntarily. Instead, he is permitted by these highly
                   trained law enforcement professionals to grab one of his
                   guns. But they don't shoot him right away. Oh no. They
                   allow him to pick up the handgun, bring it all the way up
                   to his mouth and pull the trigger. Only then, we are told,
                   does one of the officers, who wasn't paying attention,
                   pump the desperado full of lead.                    Do these BATF clowns ever learn? Either these guys
                   are Washington's answer to the Keystone Kops, or we
                   have on the loose a cold, calculating, professional,
                   Gestapo-like killing machine designed to root out
                   dissidents exercising their Second Amendment rights
                   and blow them away without the messiness of trials and
                   due process.                    How many times does America need to see such
                   tragedies before it wakes up and disarms these
                   dangerous, out-of-control, gun-slinging hitmen? The
                   inmates are running the asylum, folks. Beam me up.                    There is no allegation made by any of these cowboys
                   that Howell or any others charged in a series of raids in
                   the town of Taft last week had provided weapons to
                   criminals or represented a threat to law-abiding citizens
                   anywhere. In fact, I personally would have felt a lot
                   safer in Taft last week, before Mr. Howell was
                   "suicided" than I would today. I think most Americans
                   would.                    Let's suspend our own cognitive skills and good
                   judgment for a moment and pretend the cops' story is
                   100 percent accurate. Was the four-year investigation
                   worth it? Was it a prudent investment of taxpayer
                   dollars? Why aren't these law-enforcement heroes out
                   investigating real crimes of violence against innocent
                   victims, instead of conducting secretive sting operations
                   designed to entrap people into violating inherently
                   unconstitutional laws?                    But, you know what? Such talk can get you in trouble
                   these days. One of the BATF agents responsible for
                   this tragedy said one of Howell's friends had (gasp!)
                   complained about a ban on "assault weapons" and the
                   actions of President Clinton, Attorney General Janet
                   Reno and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein.                    At the risk of inviting a similar assault on my home or
                   business, let me pick up that cry: These are, indeed,
                   some of the people who represent a real threat to our
                   lives and liberty in America t

Forget ignorant teenagers: Let's send
politicians to the Constitution Museum
        WASHINGTON, DC -- Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell's plan to build
a museum dedicated to the Constitution should be approved, the
Libertarian Party says -- provided that every Congressman and Senator
is required to take classes there.
        "Educating ordinary Americans about freedom and individual
rights is important, but educating politicians is absolutely
essential -- because only they have the power to write laws that
threaten your life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness," said Ron
Crickenberger, national director of the Libertarian Party.
        Crickenberger's comments came in response to Rendell's request
to the Senate Appropriations Committee last week for $65 million to pay
half the cost of a museum designed to educate Americans about the
        To buttress his argument that Americans are "ignorant about
government," Rendell cited a survey of 600 teenagers showing that more
of them could name the Three Stooges (59%) than could name the three
branches of government (41%), and that while 74% could name the city
where cartoon character Bart Simpson lives (Springfield), just 12% know
where Abraham Lincoln lived (Springfield).
        Building the museum in Philadelphia, Rendell said, would help
reverse "the tide of ignorance" that is "absolutely critical to the
health of our democracy."
        Crickenberger countered: "First we need to reverse the tide of
ignorance in Congress. After all, in just the last two years, these
politicians have violated the First Amendment by trying to censor the
Internet, flouted the Second Amendment by passing the Lautenberg
gun-control law, and made a mockery of the Fifth Amendment by quietly
creating a massive federal database of every employee in America,
mandating fingerprints for drivers licenses, and imposing a national ID
        "Politicians who habitually violate the Constitution themselves
have no business lecturing ordinary Americans on this subject. Instead,
they should practice what they preach -- and be the first ones in line
when the National Center on the Constitution opens in Philadelphia.
        "And instead of hitting up taxpayers for $65 million, members
of Congress should pay for it out of their own pockets, or by
abolishing some of the unconstitutional agencies they have created,"
Crickenberger said.
        For example, he noted, the Pennsylvania delegation could urge
Congress to come up with the money by:
        * Knocking out every unconstitutional pork-barrel project that
Rep. Bud Shuster quietly inserted into the $217 billion highway bill
that Congress passed in March, such as $800,000 to renovate a historic
train station at Gettysburg and $500,000 for a study on sidewalks at
the Kennedy Center.
        * Trimming the $65 billion corporate welfare budget by
one-tenth of one percent.
        * Earmarking just 25% of the paycheck of every Senator and
Congressional representative -- and every Capitol Hill staffer making
over $100,000 -- for a single session of Congress.
        * Eliminating just one of the hundreds of unconstitutional
federal agencies Congress has created, such as the National Endowment
for the Arts, which has a budget of $100 million a year.
        Then, after attending classes at this museum, members of
Congress should have one other requirement, said Crickenberger.
        "Before graduating from their class on the Constitution, these
politicians should be required to prove their knowledge by repealing
every unconstitutional law they ever passed," he said. "That's the best
way to set an example for American teenagers -- and it doesn't require
building another museum in Philadelphia."

One of the things I like about the internet, especially email, is that my voice and the voices of others are leveled. My voice can reach a multitude of people at least intelligent enough to get on the But better than that is my ability to receive the other voices is enhanced much more. I can hear what a lot of people hear without their voices being filtered by the likes of Dan Rather, Tom Brokay and the rest of the Liberal broadcast media. It fact is is mostly just limited to what I choose to listen to.
I also get to talk back to people with whom I disagree. I listen to their responses and sometimes modify my thinking. I also get affirmation of what I do believe from people of a like mind.
Occasionally I am surprised to find others who are different but also intelligent and very persuasive in their convictions. I revel in this controversy and learn much from it. I confess that sometimes I troll for flames to get the dialog going. If you have something to say, say it! Even the words of the clueless are sometimes enlightening.
To all of you who are offended by what you read or have been attacked and shirk away I say, stick around, learn and grow. The words which come to you can not hurt you if you don't let them. If you are to timid to endure a few flames then woe be unto you if anyone comes at you with actual violence on his mind.

A LIFE-AND-DEATH ISSUE
To proceed we need at least a working definition. It is a reflection of the
enormous mystery of the subject that we do not have a generally accepted
definition of evil. Yet in our hearts I think we all have some
understanding of its nature. For the moment I can do no better than to heed
my son, who, with the characteristic vision of eight-year-olds, explained
simply, "Why, Daddy, evil is 'live' spelled backward." Evil is in
opposition to life. It is that which opposes the life force. It has, in
short, to do with killing. Specifically, it has to do with murder-namely,
unnecessary killing, killing that is not required for biological survival.

And while we are on the subject, nothing gets to me quite so easily as self-styled educated men who cannot spell or form a grammatically correct sentence. You attempt to flame those whose logic is faulty and come off looking like ignorant boobs.
If you had done a little more reading in your past you would be able to recognize your own poor ability to communicate yet you rail on about the cluelessness of AOLers who haven't read the constitution. My question is how is it that you are able to read it?
I have pity for those who are products of the public school system but they have an excuse. What excuse do computer programmers have? They are forced to think logically yet so often refuse to do so in matters of real life. They often fall back upon the constitutionality of a particular concept yet haven't tested it with the power of their own sense of truth and justice.
Such is the substance of lawyers and politicians.
I recently saw a posting about right v. wrong or good v. evil. These are subjective terms as any good semanticist knows. But what is real and what is unreal is a much more difficult thing to determine. It requires rigorous thinking without prejudice or belief getting in the As to law. The first of the Bill of Rights says:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
If you are going to quote something, do it fully and accurately. It isn't that hard and if you don't have a copy of the constitution laying around then either get one or keep your damn mouth shut until you know what you are talking about.
No, the words "seperation of church and state" do not appear but then neither does "privacy", but it is damn well implied by the 4th amendment. Those self-righteous pricks who want bible reading in the schools and rail against those who recite the 1st amendment either lack understanding of the term "reading" or are being dishonest by insisting that disallowing teachers to read the bible to students is wrong and that the constitution needs to be amended. Anyone with any honesty would realize that the first amendment doesn't prohibit bible reading by students or even bible study in a historical context. It merely prohibits tax-paid teachers from "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;". If I see just one more bible-thumping zealot message about "would you care to show us where "seperation of church and state" is to be found in the constitution/bill of rights?" I will be tempted to take him out in the parking lot and pound sand into the parts which are unaccustomed to this substance.
I am all for separation of school and state. Show me where in the constitution/bill of rights everyone is entitled to a theft/tax funded education. This would solve church and state in schools wouldn't it. If you don't like your kids getting a non-religious education from the godless state, you are free to pull them out and put them into a private school of your choice.

twit, v.t, twitted, twitting. address teasingly.
I'm touched! You think I'm teasing you? Well, I'm NOT teasing you. You're an ASSHOLE! Yes I spelled it correctly so there wouldn't be any misunderstanding. You're a self-righteous prick who dumps on people just because they have a certain email address without any consideration for what they may be saying. Yes there are clueless people at AOL and there are clueless people at got.net and at intnet.net. So what?
When you cut yourself off from people just because of their email address you do yourself a disservice but when you try to dissuade others because of your prejudice then you wrong us as well. I am quite able to evaluate the worthiness of someones words without your superior pronouncements.
If you don't have anything of value to add to the discussion then

Thank you for your thoughtful and honest response.
I am interested in the two meanings of "Just". When you say you have blind spots do you mean that you delude yourself in some ways? I would say this is true of all of us, however I would say that by recognizing that you do have shortcomings you are making an effort at improving. I also have many shortcomings and I am trying to improve.
I tend to be rather intolerant of stupid people who think they are so superior and that their way is the only way people should live. They will never hesitate to lecture others about their concept of morality, which usually involves the use of weapons and stealing, for the greater good. Such is the morality of the current occupant of the I tend to lecture people about the value of freedom and peaceful persuasion to get what I want. It is a benifit to many to trade peacefully rather than take what we want by force. This is my concept of what is just. It is my concept of the "Greater Good." I carry this to the extreme that if it comes down to the issue of if my survival can only be secured by the use of force to steal from others thereby taking their life or any part of it, then it is right that I should I don't have any children so I cannot say what I would do if it came down to the life of one of mine. I would be very much more tolerant of a mother who was put in this situation.
I once, long ago had it explained to me the difference between charity and welfare. Don Tarbell explained that if he were to see a person who was starving. He would help them in whatever way he wanted short of stealing. Welfare on the other hand steals from people who might have contributed voluntarily but then resent being forced to help. Welfare is unjust.
I have recently began reading what promises to be a very good book. It is "People of the Lie" by M. Scott Peck M. D. It is about human evil. One of the responses to a quote from the book which I posted was "Ask the antelope if he thinks the lion is evil, perhaps you have this view because no animal considers you a tasty morsel."
This is non-responsive in that we are talking about Human Evil and BTW there are many animals which would consider me much more than a "tasty morsel." We have very large aligators here in Florida which often eat small children, however very few people consider them evil by human standards, they are simply doing what they do.
The difference is that humans have, by deciding to be civil toward one another, decided that they will not eat each other and eat lower forms of life instead. Perhaps we should ask cows if they think WE are evil.
As to freedom of speech. I believe that I have much to gain by listening to what others have to say. This is a rational attitude I think because communication is what separates us from the lower forms of animals. It allows us, with our short lifespans to capitalize on creative ideas which our larger brains made possible. Without communication those ideas would die with us. We would be very little better off than chimpanzies. Perhaps able to fashion tools but unable to show others how to do the same. Each creation would have to be repeated in each individual.
But because I can communicate that idea which I have created to another, even though I didn't act upon it, the idea will outlive me and be a benifit to many. The wheel is an invention so old that it is impossible to discover when it was first used. But although it was surely created over and over many times it's spread was accomplished many times faster because the concept could be drawn on the wall of a cave with another very useful invention. This is the vaule of communication and "free speech."
Speech and the written word and now the internet. Not many realize that the internet is the most significant advance in technological evolution to have happened in a very long time. Why do I say this? Because it has enhanced communication manyfold. Radio and TV are one-
way only and are inferior to the printing press so don''t represent much of an advance. Any attempt by governments to curtail this enhanced speech is, in my opinion evil.

If you are using the accounts of others without permission then you are a thief and you don't come up to the standards of the least intelligent user at AOL or anywhere else for that matter. You will eventually be caught and hopefully be put away somewhere dark where the guards will not care how loud you scream.
Of course you will think this is an empty threat but it is not a threat at all. It is a prediction. You are to young and stupid to cover your tracks well enough to not be caught.

If you have Microsoft Word (6.0 or later), and have a thesaurus
installed, do the following:
1) Open a new, blank document.
2) Type in the words: I'd like to see Bill Clinton resign.
3) Highlight the entire sentence.
4) Click on the tools menu and select thesaurus (tools, language,
   thesaurus)
Look what is immediately highlighted in the selection box.
