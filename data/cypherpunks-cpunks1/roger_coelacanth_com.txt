@_subject: Is there a moderator in your future? 
> Why is Dyson of EFF enthusiastic about the concept?
   Because as moderators add value to the vast amount of stuff
   out there.  Why do some people pay to get a restricted subset
   of the cypherpunks?  Because they don't want the massive flow
   of wide open communications and they *trust* the person
   giving them the subset.     Moderators provide a great service, and it is finially being
   recognized as such in a monetary way.  I think that this    is a great thing!
I agree that moderated groups are useful at keeping the SNR high, and
are a great choice for those who can't or haven't time to set up their
own filters. However, they can't solve the problems that the Internet
is popularly supposed to have (e.g. no provisions for eliminating
parental responsibility).  Even supposing that US ISPs are *prohibited
by law* from carrying unmoderated Usenet groups, how does this address
all of the other services (current and future) that can be carried by
the Internet?  Sorry, the horse is out of the stable, and the only 99%
control option open to the government now is cutting the phone lines
at the border.
If an individual (e.g. a parent) wants to limit net access for certain
services to emasculated resources, perhaps Microsoft Restrict (TM) and
Prodigy can provide a desired service.  Otherwise, the solution to the
problem has to lie closer to home.

Come on, Dave, this isn't alt.2600!  Most of the subscribers to this list are professionals -- engineers,
programmers, mathematicians, lawyers -- not phone phreaks.  I'm sure
that there are more than a few of us with the knowledge, experience,
and free access to the resources needed to handle most relatively
small-scale designs like this.
(It's like saying that no one on cypherpunks has access to the
distributed computing resources necessary to perform other sorts of
brute-force cracking -- which is patently ludicrous.)
For instance, from where I'm sitting in my *home* office, I can see
the full development packages for Xilinx and AT&T FPGAs, Viewlogic
VHDL, schematic, and simulation tools, an HP 1660A logic analyser, and
a Tek THS 720 500 MHz digital scope.
And I doubt if I'm the only one here who does this for a living.
The problem isn't resources, but time and motivation -- what sort of
situation would it take to get me (for instance), and one of
cypherpunk's cryptography wizards, to take the time to collaborate on
something like this.
(BTW, if you're willing to break the design into a couple of FPGAs,
like the Motorola MPA 1000 devices, you can find all the software you
need for free...)

Huh?  We're talking about modern FPGAs here.  The cost of the tools
necessary to actually *program* the damn things is very small, as
almost all of them are SRAM-based and programmed out of an external
EPROM, bus, or serial bitstream.
Sure, we've spent $50,000 on FPGA *development* tools, but we program
the serial EEPROMs themselves on $300 PC-based programmers which are
available -- as are the FPGAs and EEPROMs -- from Digikey, Allied,
Newark, etc., to anyone with a credit card.
Actually, in almost all of our designs, the FPGAs are programmed
in-circuit by application software.  If I were to design a hardware
key cracker, it would almost certainly be a simple ISA-bus card
containing a couple of big Xilinx FPGAs which would get programmed by
a simple C program.
[Funny thing -- there seems to be a lot of "theft" of satellite and
 cable programming by folks who know just enough to use a soldering
 iron, but haven't a clue about what really happens inside a set-top
 box.  How do they manage it, if they don't have the tools to design or
 reverse-engineer a cable converter?  Hmmm...]

Yes, except that we weren't talking about securing the privacy of the

the caller from being reported to WATS-line customers.
Until recently at least, ANI and CLID information was not available

US 900 MHz digital cordless phones use MSK modulation on one of 40
channel pairs at 902.59-903.59 and 926.59-927.59 MHz.  Privacy is
achieved by XORing a PN sequence with the CODEC data.  The sequence
offset is determined by a 16-bit code derived from the base unit's
serial number (handset's codes are programmed when placed in the base
Simple scrambling, not any "encryption" worthy of the name.
A little experimentation with a cordless phone, a scanner with an MSK
demodulator, a sound board, and some simple code to capture serial
data on your computer's printer port would yield all of the frame
information you need, and could then be used to capture real-world
data for analysis.  Post-processing of the captured data would yield the scrambling code
in a matter of a day or so, and then you'd have the code for that
target phone.

I see two problems right off the top:
1. Given the number of images, sound files, and movies that the most

   propagating the associated files all over the net would be
   tremendous;
2. If CDA begins to be seriously enforced, Usenet will suffer as much
   as the Web: as soon as ISPs have reason to believe that such and
   such a newsgroup is carrying unlawful material, they'll have to
   stop spooling those groups.  The material will move into off-topic

Why do you need two lists?  My server currently hosts a few such lists
(for non-profit international technical projects, extended family
news, etc.):
Subscribers send mail to the list server, PGP-encrypted with the
list's public key.  The list server decrypts each inbound message with
its private key (passphrase entered at reboot).  The message may be a
message to the list, or a command to the list server.
The list server maintains a list of subscribers' public keys and
encrypts each list message (or digest, for higher-volume lists) for
each subscriber (our lists are small, so we prefer to encrypt mail for
one subscriber at a time).
Although messages exist temporarily as plain text arrays in the list
server, it doesn't maintain an archive of messages.  And as with any
(semi-)secure server, physical security is an issue.
As Allen mentioned, I think PGPdomo handles this, but majordomo is
pretty easy to hack up for any variation on this theme...
