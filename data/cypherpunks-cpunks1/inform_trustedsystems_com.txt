           ADDENDA & ERRATA WEB SITE FOR WINDOWS NT                           SECURITY GUIDELINES
We now have an Addendad and Errata web page for our Windows NT Security Guidelines. We highly recommend you periodically visit this page, especially if you are actively using these guidelines. Some of the addenda topics include "Limiting Installers in the WINNT & Registry ACL Settings," "Minimizing Services & Stolen Service Password," and "Software Installation that "Moves" New Items into Protected Directories."                       SUPER CACLS REPORT                     The latest version of Super CACLS is version 2.52. If youï¿½ve licensed an earlier version, you can receive a free upgrade from our web site by using your update code. Trusted Systems Services (and Super CACLS) have been selected to be a security sponsor of the upcoming 1998 Compaq Grand Slam Tennis Cup to be held in Munich, Germany this month. Super CACLS was used to set up the network for all journalists in the Olympic Hall. Stefan Werner, Chief Technical Officer for this event said, "We like Super CACLS because of its enhanced and easy-to-use features in modifying ACLs for securing NT-mass-rollouts." If you havenï¿½t tried Super CACLS, youï¿½re invited to try our full demo available at : ***************************************************************                     ADVANCED CHECKER STATUS REPORT               (formerly known as Checker or Super Checker)
Our newest networking security tool, Advanced Checker, is in the formal testing phase. Advanced Checker is a fully-featured, programmable scripting language that checks, and in some cases corrects, the security attributes of a Windows NT Server or Workstation. Advanced Checker lets you create simple "scripts" in text files using any text editor. You then run Advanced Checker which reads the scripts and performs its security checks. The security parameters it checks include the ACLï¿½s of files and directories on NTFS file systems, Registry keys and share directories, audit SACLï¿½s, registry values, audit policy, rights policy and more. We believe that Advanced Checker will fundamentally change the way that beginning and especially advanced networking administrators monitor and manage the security of their networks. It gives you unprecedented power and flexibility in an easy-to-use package that we are committed to expand and improve through feedback from our customers. We hope youï¿½ll give this product a try when it debuts later this year.
