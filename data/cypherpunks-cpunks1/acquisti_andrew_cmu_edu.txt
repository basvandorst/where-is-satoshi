You are invited to submit nominations to the 2006 PET Award.
The PET Award is presented annually to researchers who have made

or deployment of privacy enhancing technology. It is awarded at
the annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Workshop (PET). The PET
Award carries a prize of 3000 Euros thanks to the generous support
of Microsoft.
Any paper by any author written in the area of privacy enhancing
technologies is eligible for nomination. However, the paper must
have appeared in a refereed journal, conference, or workshop with
published proceedings in the period that goes from the end of the
