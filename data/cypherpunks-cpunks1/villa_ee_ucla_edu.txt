Hi All,
The most recent New Yorker has an article called
"Heres Looking at You: Invasion of the drones" by
Nick Paumgarten. I haven't actually read the article yet - online
access is behind a paywall, so I'm going to buy this on the
newsstand. For those of you who are New Yorker subscribers,
here is the link:
Apparently (based on the article description at the New Yorker
web site that's not behind the paywall),the article does
consider privacy concerns, though I don't know to what depth,
or with what conclusion or point of view.

@_subject: [drone-list] Drones Up to 25 Pounds Allowed for U.S. Safety 
Hi all,
Thanks to Nabiha for posting this link. I've been trying
to understand how, if the law stated 4.4 pounds, the FAA agreements
allow UAVs up to 25 pounds. With the full recognition that there's
more information needed, here's one possible explanation
for consideration:
The law says that
"Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act
[e.g. May 14], the Secretary shall enter into agreements" that,
among other things "allow a government public safety agency to
operate unmanned aircraft weighing 4.4 pounds or less."
However, the law didn't explicitly say that the FAA *couldn't*
authorize heavier UAVs. It just says that UAVs of 4.4 pounds
or less must be provided for. So, if the FAA had, on May 14,
entered into agreements that placed an upper limit of 3 pounds,
it would not have been in compliance with the law. But, a cap exceeding
4.4 pounds is apparently, from a strictly logical standpoint,
believed by the FAA to be within the scope of the language.
I'm not saying that I agree that this was the intent of the
law, but that this may be one explanation for the 4.4 vs. 25 pound
If that is indeed the case, it's probably not a bad idea to
re-examine the entire UAV section of the law with this sort of
thing in mind to whether there are other sections where the
language admits this sort of flexibility.
Again, the above may not be the correct explanation, as it
seems like we are missing some information regarding the
decisions that led to the 25-pound number.

Hi - article today, "Could We Trust Killer Robots?"
This article discusses research (and I'm not making this up)
into "lethal autonomous systems" - e.g. algorithms that
would enable drones to make automated decisions to launch
