"They're going to obtain a copy of the software anyway, so why not make a

Yes, but see my previous post.
Same problem as traffic analysis if you are talking about compromising the
remailer. Doesn't work after the fact. (Plus, the risk of detection is
certainly non-zero.)
If you're talking about exploiting flaws in the remailer message
encryption or in the mix-net protocol, that would work, but also would
rely upon having remailer traffic be intercepted and collected for later
Stats manipulation has been discussed before. (LEAs run remailers, and
then ensure that their remailers are at the top of the stats pages, either
by falsifying stats or causing legitimate remailers to sink lower on the
stats then LEA remailers.)
Another half-decent attack if planned in advance.
I'm not skeptical as to how effective that would be. Look at all the times

@_subject: Remailers, N-Grams, and Google 
Here's a thought.
Given a comprehensive collection of public Internet communication,
including Usenet, mailing list traffic, weblog entries, etc, and an
advanced semantic analysis algorithm, it should be fairly trival to take
the n-gram (or other semantic signature) of a remailed message, and search
a database of these signatures for possible matches.
Google's got the raw material, and surely the NSA does as well. (If the
FBI hadn't been collecting this information all along, would they even
need to ask a court to get the NSA to share it with them? I'm talking
about purely public info -- nothing that Google wouldn't have.)
A program could be written to run over time, generating n-grams which
would then be stored in the database alongside the original text. The
program should be smart enough to ignore mail headers, footers, etc., but
none of this would be difficult given a good semantic analysis algo.
(N-grams appear to be less effective on small documents, though if two
documents were known to be authored by the same person, they should be
able to be treated as one.) When an anonymous text's n-gram would be
entered into the search engine, the database would return all documents
with similar n-grams. This should reveal the likely identity of the author
in a large number of cases. *Then* you could Magic Lantern him or
What's the current state of public research in this area? Does anything
exist that would be useful for practical application at this point? (I'm
not sure how reliable n-grams would be on this kind of scale, and I
haven't been able to find much via Google that really answers that.)
I don't think I am saying anything new here. I'm bringing this because it
seems like the solution to defeating remailers that involves the least
legal hassle, can be applied retroactively, does not involve an
unreasonable amount of computing power or deployed equipment, and has
a decent chance of success for a good number of messages. (It won't work
if the LEA doesn't have the plain text message that was sent through the
remailer, or if the message was simply a binary file, news report, or
something else not of the sender's own words, but it would work on
messages exchanged discussing plots, drug deals, threats, kiddie-porn
solicitation, naughty fantasies on alt.personals.bondage, etc.
And then there's the added bonus of still working, even if the things Tim
says are needed exist (much greater number of remailers, more traffic,
etc.) and working on *any* form of anonymous communication, including
missives deposited in postal drop boxes (assuming tomorrow's unibombers
post to Usenet.)
There could also be a commercial or individual demand for such a system.
Suppose I wanted to read everything that Eric Hughes has written and
published publicly online over the past 20 years. How would I go about
such a search? Searching by name or email address will miss quite a lot.
If Google had n-gram searching, and a "submit your text sample for
n-gramification" cgi, I'd have more luck. Anyone at Google want to take me
up on this?
I'm sure there's other more practical uses that I'm missing as well.

the need for user assurance that the tracking tokens are not being used as

Certainly wise, though not popular with the remailer users (see the
thread on alt.privacy.anon-server discussing the recent switch by one of
the most popular mail2news gateways to this type of system, where a
disclaimer is placed at the top of the message.) The simple truth is that
the average user can't be expected to look at mail or news headers,
though, so you need to place such things in the body.
What about an "opt-in" service for mailing list admins?
I've thought about this before. I was concerned about the potential risks
of keeping the messages in an identifiable manner on the remailer
server... but if everything is encrypted, it wouldn't matter.
Unfortunately, requiring everything be encrypted also limits the
whistle-blower, anonymous tipster applications of these systems.
Additionally, it would be nice if the major PGP implementations supported
the "stealth encryption" features, too. (Yes, there's ways to make do
without it...)

Judging from the trouble that company has had over the course of its
history, I wouldn't be surprised if this decision would have happened
regardless of the terrorist attacks. NAI has been down-sizing over the
past year, and recently moved a good number of its positions out of the
Bay Area to places like Maryland and (gasp) Canada.
Both the 300 employee figure and the PGP name are misleading. My
understanding (and this is based on a conversation I had with a PGP
employee over a year ago, so it may not be exactly accurate) is that the
300 employees were of the "PGP Security, Inc." business unit. NAI was
restructured into four business units in 1999: Sniffer, Magic, McAffee,
and PGP Security. PGP Security was responsible for the traditional "Phil's
PGP"  products and their off-shoots as well as the TIS products (Gauntlet
Firewall, etc.) and NAI's IDS software (Cybercop.) This business unit
probably also had its own marketing and sales and support divisions.
"PGP Security" was far more than just the PGP product Cypherpunks think
of. I suspect the business unit was named this to capitalize on the
reputation of the PGP name.
Taking this into consideration, however, the employee numbers make a bit
more sense.
Decentralization has been discussed extensively here in the past, so I'm
not going to comment on that. However, I haven't seen any really plausible
suggestions on how to go about hiding the location of network
infrastructure providing a service. Sure, some components of the system
can be hidden, such as middleman remailers operating behind nym.alias.net
accounts, but this still requires some remailers to be "out in the open."
And, of course, if a physical component is required, then the service will
be subject to some nation's laws.
The best we can do is ensure that there is no nation whose laws affect all
components of this system. (Example being the decentralized network of
mixmaster remailers scattered around the globe.)
This isn't a solution, however. Every nation in which remailers currently
reside could pass a resolution banning them, and that would be curtains.
So, back to my point. The problems I see with achieving the ideal
environment for such services are:
1) How does one avoid being in the jurisdiction of any nation?
2) How does one hide the physical locations of any part of an entire
The first problem is pretty unsolvable. (Starting your own country is not
a feasible solution, in my opinion. For instance, Sealand exists because
Britain tolerates it. As soon as it is branded "a terrorist bunker in
cyberspace" there would be plenty of justification for bombing it.)
I'm interested in hearing thoughts on the second problem, or pointers to

@_subject: What info does Zero Knowledge collect on users of Freedom 
I suppose that my question, (assuming what Anonymous described is the
actual behavior of Freedom 3.0), would now be: "who cares?" What is left
in the Freedom product that this would matter?
Your ISP and the world are not likely to care that you're using an
glorified cookie-manager, and it's my impression that that is what Freedom
has now become.
However, for the sake of clarity, it would indeed be nice to know what
the information those HTTP requests actually means, and for what purpose
it is being generated.
Also, are there any threats created by such information leakage? How could
Freedom 3.0 users be harmed by this?
(If the same behavior was present in Freedom 2.0, I can imagine some more
obvious immediate threats. If what Dov says is true, it's remarkable that
ZKS hadn't been called on this previously. But now that Freedom is no
longer an anonymity service, what are the concerns?)

I don't have time to respond in depth to the points Tim makes here, so I
have snipped a lot of them. I intend to come back and comment in more
detail later.
Largely, I am in agreement. However, in the paragraphs I've quoted below,
Tim touches on a counter-argument and dismisses it. I'll like to expand
upon that a bit.
I think that this "danger to others" issue will lead us right back where
we started. It would not simply be an issue of various airports denying
use, but also communities denying airspace rights. And you can bet that,
in a world where airlines were permitted to have no security procedures,
XYZ Airlines would also have to abide by "no-fly zones" set up by the
larger, more security-conscious cities, enforceable by SAMs.
There would probably be places in the mid-west that permitted such
airlines to operate their services. But the market would surely kill them
swiftly if they were denied the ability to fly or land in any popular
area. Customers would go elsewhere, not because of the lax security, but
because of the limited service offerings.
If planes didn't bring down office buildings, if there were no issue of
airline policies posing a danger to others, perhaps this would be

My apologies. Dismiss was not the correct word.
I suppose I view this issue as a larger hurdle then you do.
Okay. I took your thoughts to mean that you were envisioning a market
where the level of security provided by the airlines was completely under
the control of the airlines themselves, and would be adjusted by the
airlines according to the demands of the customers (and to a lesser
extent, the employees and share-holders) so that the airline could remain
My point was that such a system wouldn't get off the ground. The issue
isn't simply *actual* collateral damage. Airlines would have to get
permission to use the airspace their planes would occupy. If an airline's
proposed security measures didn't meet with the requirements for the
community controlling the airspace that airline wished to utilize, the
airline wouldn't ever have the chance to see how the market would react to
its security offering. I think it's a non-starter, because the potential
collateral damage and the reliance on third-party "right-of-ways" is too
Such a system could work well in other instances, though.
Compare to private railway lines. A private train service would be able to
initiate such a system with much greater ease, since there is much less
potential collateral damage, and less use of third-party resources and
Call me a pessimist, but I can't see how an airline with "less than
acceptable for the Common Good" security measures would ever be able to
begin operating. I don't think we'd ever have the opportunity to see what
the market reaction would be -- the airline would not fly one plane.
Oh, Tim... I wasn't complaining. You asked for thoughts, and I was
offering mine.

To elaborate a little,
In the PGP-style "Web of Trust", each user is effectively his own
Certificate Authority. Likewise, each user has his own form of CPS. Some
users will indiscriminately sign other people's keys. Some users will
require "government issued ID". Some users will require that they
personally know another person for some set amount of time before signing
his key.
By signing a key, you are, in effect, asserting to the world a belief in
the identity of the key holder. One can communicate securely with other
users even if he never signs another person's key. Signing is entirely
optional -- a service, so to speak, to the other members of one's
community.  (Indeed, there are more than a few cypherpunks who do not sign
keys at all, because of the information it reveals about their
associations with others.)
Those of us who know better would not rely on a simple picture ID to prove
identity. Likewise, we would not put much faith in certifications made by
someone who used that criteria for verification. But PGP users are free to
use whatever means they like in "verifying" identities.
The problem I see in "V Alex Brennen's" announcement is that he is
requiring photo-ID for a key signing party. The *only* function a key
signing party serves is to facilitate the pairing of keys (by their
fingerprints) with bodies (either individuals, or organizations
represented by the proper individuals). The key signing party organizer's
responsibility ends there. He should not be dictating key signing policy
to the end users.
Picture IDs are just one of many methods of determining identity, and as
Tim points out, a poor one, and useless for pseudonyms.
In the case of a conference or other gathering of strangers where a large
key signing party is planned, it is my recommendation that, rather than
each individual signing keys of other conference attendees (unless there
is an existing trust relationship between individual attendees), the
conference organizers create a conference signing key with which to sign
attendees' keys. This provides information about the key (it was presented
at such-and-such a conference by a person calling himself so-and-so) and
also clearly defines the limits of this information. Users can later take
that into account when evaluating whether or not to "trust" the signed key.
(Many of us will find this certification useless, and others will find it
undesirable for the information it leaks about us. Which is why key
signings are voluntary.)

@_subject: Government credentials and picture IDs 
To elaborate a little,
In the PGP-style "Web of Trust", each user is effectively his own
Certificate Authority. Likewise, each user has his own form of CPS. Some
users will indiscriminately sign other people's keys. Some users will
require "government issued ID". Some users will require that they
personally know another person for some set amount of time before signing
his key.
By signing a key, you are, in effect, asserting to the world a belief in
the identity of the key holder. One can communicate securely with other
users even if he never signs another person's key. Signing is entirely
optional -- a service, so to speak, to the other members of one's
community.  (Indeed, there are more than a few cypherpunks who do not sign

Before launching your tirade against Phil, did you perhaps stop and think
that this could be an entirely inaccurate representation of what Phil
actually said to the reporter?
In an earlier article, Phil is quoted, and does not sound "guilty" or
"ashamed" for having written PGP:
Frankly, I wouldn't know of any diplomatic way to respond to the email in
question either.
I *highly* doubt that Phil would have given this interview if he had known
that was the slant the reporter was going to take.
This is why I generally do not speak to reporters. Most are self-serving
sensationalistic jackasses, or simply clueless. Poor Phil, still believing
in the idea that unbiased journalism is a realistic concept.
Again, I see nothing quoted in that article that would lead me to believe
those are Phil's thoughts, rather than the reporter's.
Let me break this down here:
"Like many Americans, Phil Zimmermann, a stocky, 47-year-old computer
programmer, has been crying every day since last week's terrorist

many reasons why one would cry over the attacks and deaths of more than
5000 people.

those with a "key" could read them."
Also incorrect. PEM based systems existed.
"No government or law enforcement agency has been able to get in."
Tell that to our dear mob friend in New Jersey sitting in jail right now.
Clearly this journalist does not believe in checking her facts.
"People warned Zimmermann back then that he could be putting powerful
technology into the wrong hands. He knew that was theoretically possible,
but he also knew that the program could do good: His work created a way
for people in oppressed countries to communicate without fear of
"Now the government is investigating whether Zimmermann's technology or
another scrambler was used by the hijackers to coordinate last week's
attacks, and U.S. lawmakers are calling for new restrictions on the use
and distribution of the technology."
There has been no evidence made public whatsoever to suggest that
hijackers used PGP to coordinate these attacks. The reporter made that up
out of whole cloth. The US government is investigating a lot of things; no
where has it been stated that they are paying any special attention to a
PGP - bin Laden link.
"Zimmermann and other fathers of encryption say it may be too late, given
that the technology has spread all over the world."
Too late for what? Too late to provide any "safety" to citizens by
depriving them of the security that PGP affords, that's what. This is a
watered down version of the argument that laws against crypto will not
stop criminals from using it, since it is widely and freely available.
"In a telephone interview from his home in Burlingame, Calif., Zimmermann
said he doesn't regret posting the encryption program on the Internet. Yet
he has trouble dealing with the reality that his software was likely used
for evil."
Phil probably said that he doesn't regret *writing* PGP, since he is
always very clear that he did not post it. If he were in fact overwhelmed
with guilt, he'd be regretting having written it. And the idea that "his
software was likely used for evil" has nothing to do with reality. Another
error on the part of the journalist.
"The intellectual side of me is satisfied with the decision, but the pain
that we all feel because of all the deaths mixes with this," he said. "It
has been a horrific few days."
Ah, finally an actual quote. Or one that appears to be, anyway. Note it's
pain because of the deaths, not because of any link to PGP, that he is
referring to. Conjecture on the part of the journalist.
"Zimmermann read the words over and over again the next day, trying to
think of a way to respond. But in the end, the man who is known in the
technology world for his rousing speeches and meticulous debates didn't
know what to say."
I wouldn't know what to say to such an ignoramus either. Delete.
"He raises some points that many people are raising right now, namely that
terrorists can use the technology," Zimmermann said quietly. "But it
overlooks the strong need for good crypto."
This is nothing new. It is not new to us, nor is it new to Phil. It is,
however, apparently quite a new idea that Ariana Eunjung Cha has yet to
grasp -- tools, in the hands of good people, can be used for good. In the
hands of evil people, can be used for evil. Tools are not inherently good
or evil.

journalists with a smidgeon of intelligence to staff your offices?
If I were Phil, I'd sue for libel.

Signed messages can become a liability. Why provide potentially dangerous

It is not possible to do PGP/MIME with these apps. Take a look at M$'s
mail plugin API, and you will see why.
Very good. I'm glad you know what the acronym stands for. That doesn't
change the fact that RSA doesn't have any "patent on PKI". [Though yes,
I'm sure they have a slew of patents on specific features of their PKI
apps. If I don't say that, someone's going to nit.]
My apologies. I sometimes forget that people can't hear me snickering when
I am sending email. You weren't expected to answer that question.
Seasoned members of the cypherpunks list are intimately familiar with
RSA's crypto patents.
No, the patent was completely irrelevant. For non-commercial apps, there
was RSAREF. For commercial apps, BSAFE was available with a license. For
those who didn't want to deal with the RSA patent, there were other public
key algorithms. The Diffie/Hellman/Merkle patents expired years ago.
RSA (the company)'s patents may have caused developers to use algorithms
like DSS, ElGamal, and Diffie-Hellman rather than RSA (the algorithm), or
limited the adoption of Rivest's later algorithms (which were not nearly
as ground-breaking), but saying that a patent on one algorithm prevented
(or even significantly impacted) the adoption of cryptographic functions
in email clients is patently absurd.
BTW, S/MIME (with, *gasp*, RSA) has been available in most commercial mail
clients for years.
That isn't what this discussion is about. We've been talking about
arguments against signing in a manner incompatible with the tools the
majority of your readers are using, not arguments against signing in
general. Though there are plenty of those as well.

Once again, you're confusing the issue. MIME *handling* isn't what we are

Proof? No proof. All I see is hyperbole.
First of all, there is nothing insecure with the way RFC 2440 specifies
message creation. The benefits that PGP/MIME offers mainly take effect
when MIME is already being used for other reasons -- i.e., signing of
messages with attachments, etc.
PGP/MIME offers no benefits when it is a plain text ASCII email being
People who march around the net using incompatible, irrelevant, or
otherwise inconvenient protocols and subject others to the cruft these

so it's not my problem that you can't read my mail" *harms* attempts to
facilitate wide-spread adoption of crypto technologies. Joe User sees this
sort of thing happening, and decides to stay far away from PGP because "it

Virtually all cultures have held the mythological belief that all "beings
with souls" have a True Name, and that knowledge of one's true name
leads to power over him.
(This isn't really surprising, since the True Name concept features
prominently in Babylonian mythology, from which the myths of nearly all
other civilizations have sprung.)
For instance, knowing the True Name of a god could result in one being
granted godly powers, or immortality (cf: Isis learning the True Name of
Ra in Egyptian mythology). In Greek (and neo-pagan) nature myths, speaking
the true name of a landscape object could give the speaker protection or
favors from the spirit inhabiting the object. In Hebrew, Essene, and
Islamic mythology, as well as Celtic, Pacific Island, and Norse
tales, the True Name theme appears repeatedly. Etc.

Operating an anonymity service or providing privacy enhancing
technologies to the public poses potential risks to the provider if
sufficiently motivated entities wish to prevent the availability of such
In particular danger are individuals whose meatspace identity and nyms are
not publicly linked. If the attacker is able to compromise a nym and
silence the individual in meatspace, other anonymity providers and the
general public will have no way of knowing that this has occurred.
This is information that is important to the public (who will want to know
if a remailer's operator has disappeared, though his remailer is still
operating) and to the other operators (who may be next.)
Given the practice of remops hiding their identities, it would be somewhat
difficult to connect the sudden tragic death of a quiet computer
programmer in Arkansas with the abrupt silence of the operator of a
remailer in New York, whose ID is unknown to all but a very few.[1]
Given the necessity of providing on-going administration for a remailer
server, and the lack of a viable IP-level anonymity system, a remop's
identity is almost surely known to any attacker who can observe network
traffic. Operating a remailer while concealing one's name from the general
public makes it easier for this attacker to hide one's disappearance from
the public, or delay their knowledge. Still, there are many compelling
reasons to operate an anonymity service or provide anonymity software
without revealing one's name. It would be desirable for a remop to be able
to do so without putting himself at greater than normal risk.
Discussions with some members of the remailer operator community [2] have
lead me to propose the following "I am alive" monitoring system for
anonymous members.  Although it was designed with remailer operators in
mind, this system could benefit other groups which face problems similar
to the ones described above (such as human rights workers and people with
Muslim-sounding last names who have recently emigrated to America).
"I'm not Dead Yet"
1. This system assumes that a stable, reliable monitoring server can be
operated in a fixed location on the Internet.
The server stores a list of email addresses it is monitoring, a public PGP
key for each nym, and a datestamp "s" (which is a number in seconds) for
each nym.
The server is configured with an "allowed silence period" variable "T",
which is an integer equal to the number of days a monitored member may be
without contact with the server and still be considered safe.
2. Users add themselves to the system by sending a signed administrative
request to the server's email address and providing the public key to be
used. Updates to the personal information for that nym can only be changed
by further administrative email requests signed by the same key.
3. The monitoring server publishes a unique random nonce each day on its
website and posted to USENET (in a suitable place such as
The server will store a rolling list of nonces and their issuance date for
the duration of T.
4. Members being monitored obtain this nonce, sign it with the key held by
the server, and submit an "I am alive" notification.
5. Upon receipt of this notification, the server resets the datestamp s
equal to the nonce issuance time.
6. If age of s (present time in seconds minus s) for any nym entry reaches
(T-3)*86400, the nym address is pinged with a message -- "Are you alive?".
If the nym's owner were alive and had simply forgotten to check in, he
could respond within three days to avoid a false alert.
7. If the age of s reaches T*86400, a "Missing Nym" alert is issued,
either to all of the other members of the monitoring service, a separate
alerts list, or a public forum.
8. The missing nym owner can declare a false alert by checking in through
the normal fashion. (There's an application for reputation tracking on
nyms who cry wolf).
a) Nym owners will wish to communicate with the monitoring server
through anonymous remailers, as to avoid revealing their identities to the
monitoring system.
b) This system makes no distinction between nyms and true names. It can
monitor email addresses of either. This could provide a useful system even
if one is not using a real nym.
c) The PGP keys supplied to the nym server for purpose of ID verification
should be signing-only keys not used for any other purpose. This will
eliminate justification for a legal or quasi-legal entity to seize the
key.  If a member is in the position to have his keys demanded from him,
it will be obvious that this is only being done for one purpose: so that
the public can be tricked into thinking he is alive and free (when
presumably he will not be.) This should aid him in his decision to comply
or not.
[1] Anonymity software developers who publish their products anonymously
are also potentially at risk. RProcess, the author of a popular Windows
remailer client and a Mixmaster-compatible Windows remailer server
suddenly "disappeared" from alt.privacy.anon-server a little over two
years ago. His absence was noticed almost immediately, because he had been
involved in several discussions and a major project at the time of his
disappearance -- but had he been a remailer operator or a developer with
little direct interaction with the public, he may have not been missed.

I agree, although I fail to see how working on this would interfere with
that goal in any way.
I find this disbelievable. I suspect there are many groups which do not
have the capability of defeating the remailer system who would still like
to see it eliminated. Willingness to kill or disappear people isn't
necessarily tied to technical capability, though I agree that entities
which can defeat the remailer network without "disappearing" anyone are
unlikely to pose a threat to the remops. If our goal is to make remailers
harder to defeat, however, beforehand might be the right time to address
the problem of "missing remailer operators."
(Incidently, I could see this having uses outside the remailer operator
To pry the signing key out of the victim? That's a personal "how much
torture can I take" question for the victim to ask himself. He knows he'll

In many cases also it might be far harder to rubber-hose someone than
simply cause an "accident".

Which is, of course, a major flaw.
S/MIME is of some value for internal corporate email for companies who can

S/MIME is of very little value outside of a closed intranet environment,
for the simple reason that public CAs are mostly incompetent,
untrustworthy, or both.

Please. If we're going to toss around conspiracy theories, let's make sure
they are sane. I am having a hard time imagining a scenario in which it
would benefit the Israeli cause to blow up their first astronaut in space.
Perhaps if it could be made to appear as a terroristic act by the evil
ragheads, maybe Israel would attempt a stunt like this, to further the
American/Israeli "brothers in arms" mentality. But there appears to be no
such scenario that is remotely plausible.
The only theory that I find remotely worth pursuing is that the shuttle
was bringing something back to earth that didn't want to come down. Tim
seems to have thoughts about this -- how easily could a satellite be
designed with a "self-destruct upon reentering Earth's atmosphere" device?
The motivation would certainly be there. I can't see China perpetrating a
"terrorist act" against the US at this point in time, but I could see
China taking steps to prevent the successful theft of its military
surveillance devices.
This isn't to say that force majeure isn't the most likely culprit here.
Space travel is inherently dangerous, and I'm honestly surprised that less
than 2% of our shuttle flights have resulted in catastrophe.

Hmm. I actually can't find any specs on that phone's max speed. The
CDMA2000 service being offered by Sprint and Verison in the US does not
meet the criteria for 3G.
CDMA2000 1x as defined by the ITU is, a 3G standard. Keep in mind,
however, that in order to be 3G by the ITU definition, a standard needs to
deliver data rates of a minimum of 144 Kbps.
The top speed I've seen advertised for CDMA2000 deployments is 70 Kbps. Is
CDMA2000 being used outside North America? I thought GSM/GPRS was the
dominant standard in Europe and Asia. (GPRS is never 3G.)
