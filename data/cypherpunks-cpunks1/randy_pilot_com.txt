@_subject: legal rqmt for FAX return phone # 
I was _just_ speaking with a few technicians at various FAX management software  vendors.  A couple of them were saying that identifying the return telephone  number on incomings FAXes is highly problematic.  There are no established  standards regarding the format or presentation of the return FAX number  information.  Also, some older FAX machines may or may not have the feature at  I wonder, however, because it seems to me that whenever I've received FAXes in  the past (not exactly commonplace) they have always had the return FAX number  somewhere at the top of the page.

By publishing a private e-mail, both beker and Johnson are in violation of
my copyright in that message, since it was a private communication and no

Thus beker has now committed a new violation of his netcom agreement, and
Johnson shows he has bad judgement. What's more, by trying to make what
should be a private matter, to be decided by netcom based on their own
rules, into a public cause celebre, and by writing to netcom as Johnson did
to intervene in a private matter, he has made the situation worse for beker,
not better.
Netcom is perfectly capable of telling me to go peddle my papers if I'm
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!!!  I wish this man would overdose  on whatever medication he must be taking.   Or...perhaps he already has!
P.S. Sternlight breaks down into a rather amusing number of combinations if you  take it as "stern" and "light."  For example:
stern  ->  rump
light  ->  intense
