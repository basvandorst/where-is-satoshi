What if the remailer operator is not root?
I will offer to forward mail for MX records to any address via my
system (myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu).  If you want to run a remailer, and
have it be completely hidden from nameserver lookups, ask John Perry
to create an MX record for your domain which points to
myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu, and tell me the address you want it forwarded
to.  I will configure my SMTP daemon to forward all mail to your
domain to the email address your remailer is run on.
Well, to obscure the origin of your outgoing mail, you could simply
forward via another remailer.  However, delivering directly to SMTP
port 25 would probably be a good idea.  Sendmail has an option to
set the from using -f, but you have to have it configured to allow
it.  Normally only root, uucp and daemon are allowed to use this

This doesn't really sound too difficult.  Just have a script run as
user uucp which adds the header and hands the message to sendmail.
Yes, this can be done, but getting IP addresses isn't easy for most
people.  I would propose that we use the unassigned IP address blocks
which are reserved for private networks (see RFC 1597).  In fact,
we could even connect the remailer systems that use the private address
space via IP tunneling (swIPe maybe?  or SLIP over telnet?)  These
remailer hosts could then communicate with each other on a private
network, and gateway mail to the internet via "firewall" hosts.  This
approach would also allow us to connect private machines to the
remailer network by providing IP connectivity to hosts which currently
use software such as Term or TIA.  Having more remailers on private
machines would be a good thing IMHO.  Finally, such a network might
serve as a basis for building future untracable/anonymous IP routing
I wonder if the "Term" program could be modified to act as a virtual
machine?  For those not familiar with the program, it creates a unix
domain socket and supplies IP services via it, forwarding them over
a modem connection.  Many programs have been modified to work with
it.  Perhaps term could be modified to send its output to an IP
interface instead.  Each user on the system can run his own term
process and have his own virtual machine.

What follows are two small programs which I thought might be of interest to
cypherpunks.  The first (socket.c) is a simple daemon which binds a port
and accepts connections, and then forks child processes for each one.
The second (relay.c) is a simple telnet program which opens a connection to
the specified remote host and port number.  Put together they can be used
as a telnet relay ("proxy server") that works like the term redir command.
This in itself is useful, if you want to hide where you're coming in from,
bypass a broken router or get through a firewall.  But, take a look at the
loop at the end of the second program.  It simply reads input from one
socket and writes it to another.  It would seem to me very easy to add
an encryptor/decryptor to this process and encrypt your telnet sessions.
You'd just need to exchange a key (via PGP) with the remote system, and
decide on a port number, then run crypt/dec daemons on both systems.  The
socket.c program might also be useful for socket-based remailing.  (Tho
you can set it up in your inetd.conf instead, if you have root access.)
However, I'm having a bit of trouble compiling these on some platforms.
I do not know who the original author is.  (These came out of a toolkit
for breaking system security and the author did not want to be known.)
After including a few additional libraries, I was able to compile both
under Linux, and it seems to work reasonably well.  They'll also
compile under SunOS, if you include , but it won't
handle non-blocking I/O correctly, and can hang.  I can't get relay.c
to compile under Ultrix, though socket.c seems to work.  socket.c also
has a tendency to leave zombie processes hanging under Linux.
Anyone want to take a shot at debugging/porting it on other platforms
or adding crypto?

relay  You can combine them to make a telnet relay/forwarded with:
