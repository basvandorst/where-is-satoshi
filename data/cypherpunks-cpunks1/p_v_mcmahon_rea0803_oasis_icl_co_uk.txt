@_subject: Problem in draft FIPS `CRYPTOGRAPHIC SERVICE CALLS' 
DATE   FROM                   SUBJECT                                Two related points:
    1.  Sorry to waste list bandwidth with such a question, but could         someone please post to me the original "Problem in draft FIPS         `CRYPTOGRAPHIC SERVICE CALLS'" item? (my server was down at the         weekend).
    2.  NIST have proposed the draft FIPS to a number of standards         development organisations - including X/Open and POSIX - and I         know that Microsoft have reviewed it, so it will likely influence         interfaces to commercially available cryptographic software and         devices.
        If there is anybody with interest in crypto APIs on this list,         then your informed comments on this NIST proposal, or other         candidates (which I could make available if the level of interest         warranted it), or alternatives, would be useful and timely.
    Thanks
    Piers

Thanks very much. I now have the mail.        My interest in this is that I am chair of the X/Open security working group
defining a industry consensus specification for which the draft FIPS is one
of the inputs, along with other inputs from RSADSI (via Sun), IBM, HP,
Olivetti, SESAME etc.

Yes - and implemented a GSS-API mechanism.
The relationship between GSS-API and a general crypto interface is
contentious - as the interfaces to "export" a key for a remote principal
(cf ExportKey and PubExportKey in the draft FIPS) resemble the GSS-API
context initiation interface (cf gss_init_sec_context in RFC 1509), but
have more assumptions about the possible KM (key management) protocols
than GSS-API - or at least only make explicit provision for X9.17,
D-H, and RSA.
GSS-API has been implemented over Kerberos, DASS, KryptoKnight, DCE1.1,
SESAME, and possibly others I haven't heard of. Also, discussions for
an extension of GSS-API to layer over PEM/PGP were kicked off at the last
IETF to enable mail-enabled applications to be linked in to easily consume
authentication and key management services. Hence GSS-API is somewhat
proven to be KM-mechanism-independent.
There is a potential relationship between this export/import class of
interface and the IPSEC packet format (now - or soon to be? - documented),
and ongoing IETF IPSEC WG discussions re KM.
Specifically, it would be helpful for fast implementations (in both senses)
if as much of the processing of IP security could potentially be handed off
to hardware-implemented routines via common KM-mechanism-independent and
algorithm-independent interfaces (which, based on the NIST proposal
primitives, would be [Pub]ExportKey/[Pub]ImportKey, Encipher/Decipher, and
If the right interfaces are standardised in h/w crypto, perhaps little other
than negotiation and SAID handling need usually be in software.

                      Where?
Or less tersely, which users of messaging are you interested in providing
crypto for? Apart from the Defence sector, there seem to be three main 1 "Formal" inter-business electronic messaging using commercial
  value-added networks (VANs) - which are perceived as secure - and
  associated user agent software (which varies greatly). About fifty
  thousand North American companies are "there" already (for EDI,
  and at a cost). Leakage (due to high VAN costs) of formal
  messaging business from VANs onto the insecure Internet is not yet
  significant - although CommerceNet will doubtless fix that.
2 Intra-organisation nessaging based on LAN or corporate workflow and
  email systems. This has built both bottom-up and downwards (e.g. from
  PROFS or equivalent). The prevalent software is diverse, proprietary and
  volume. I don't have total market figures to hand, but as an example, the
  11JUL94 Government Computer News ranks MS Mail (Windows 3), cc:Mail
  (Windows), cc:Mail(DOS), MS Mail (PC Networks), and WordPerfect Office
  as the most preferred e-mail packages amongst Federal users. I would
  expect a similar list in most commercial email-enabled organisations
  (with the addition of Lotus Notes). Varying security facilities are   bundled within these packages already.
3 The "informal messaging" sector (including most Internet traffic).
  The associated software is more diverse and "open", but its users
  have a marginal and/or occasional need for end-to-end / message-transfer
  security.
Note: for both 1 and 2, an "insecure machine" (i.e.: with administrative intrusion potential into an individual's messaging security) is more likely
a requirement than a problem for medium/large corporations - as management
supervision and control over information assets need to be possible.
What would be done with the results?
James A. Donald says:
On the other hand, how else do you find out whether a sufficiently
serious market exists to warrant investment in developing / productising
a technology ?

@_subject: In Search of Genuine DigiCash 
Clearly there is existing practice in vendor-supplier EDI - but most
financial service organisations have not yet even been able to cost-justify
electronic processing of remittance information (for which the
manually-shipped lockbox is deemed adequate ...)
There has to be a business reason for change to any existing practice;
a general infrastructure for electronic payments is not going to be
adopted by banks just because there are available or emerging technologies.
One agent for change *may* be threat to the banks through extension of
existing EDI arrangements to include transmission of remittance data
on a bilateral or hub-spoke basis. The attractions of a fast growing
(albeit currently 500m USD) servide provider market, and real concerns
about loss of business, have spurred the establishment by partnerships
of banks of a number of check and remittance data clearing houses. With the increase in the number of trading partners, and the opportunity for the banks' commoditization of the electronic financial
transaction, there may be benefit in marketing an electronic "cash"
product - even if it's not transferable. But technology underlying this may be little more than an extension of existing solutions unless
there are compelling countervailing business reasons to change.
[Consider: who bears the cost burdens of the status quo with increasing
use of EDI by business + (mostly) manual remittance mechanisms? What will
drive this status quo to alter ...?]

All payment mechanisms require a basis of trust - so that the seller knows
s/he will get paid - and hence rely on trusted third parties (governments,
banks, charge card company etc), and/or need to be supported by specific
explicit seller-buyer contracts. Current (commercial) electronic business
transactions are underpinned by contracts, and security mechanisms
appropriate to the risks associated with the carrier of the transaction.
An "internet economy" needs a basis of trust, as well as security
mechanisms appropriate for the current level of IP security. What basis
of trust do you envisage?

... for parties with established commercial relationships.
But the contractual agreements upon which these transactions are based
don't scale too well to the [small] vendor / casual purchaser sector,
which I guess the term "internet economy" is intended to encompass.
The most likely basis of trust for this sector is not going to be achieved
through each transient buyer-and-seller pair-instance entering into an
explicit contract to enable the seller to believe the buyer's electronic
[proxy-]promissory note - but by an extension of the current mechanism for telephone or mail-order payment, with the trusted third parties being
VISA, AMEX, etc.
While CommerceNet is the most prominent make-the-internet-safe-for-business
initiative, it still only expects to have 1 million customers within five
years - a goal that is modest enough given today's Internet user base,
and growth rates. Even so, industry analysts consider this goal ambitious.
Expectations for an internet economy based on techniques above and beyond
the ability to securely send one's credit/charge card details are unlikely to be fulfilled in the short/medium term.

Indeed. But what I have still not seen in this thread is an articulation
of a business case for existing financial institutions to support
the putative [on|off]-line payment mechanisms - in particular as an
alternative to charge/credit cards for one-off transactions.

    Subject: Bellcore's Trusted Software Integrity (Betsi) System
                         A N N O U N C I N G ! ! ! ! !
             Bellcore's Trusted Software Integrity (Betsi) System.
    Betsi  addresses  a  security  concern  of  software distribution in the
    Internet.  Currently, there is no way to know that software obtained  by
    anonymous  ftp  has  not  been  modified  since  it  was  posted.  Also,
    malicious software can be posted without the offender leaving  a  trace.
    Betsi  is an experimental prototype that is meant to provide some degree
    of assurance about the integrity of software and  the  identity  of  its
    author.
    The current version of Betsi is an experiment.  The long-term goals are:
         -  help software vendors distribute programs and patches
         -  provide accountability by linking the author of a program
            to a real person whose identity is verified off-line
         -  allow users to run software obtained on the Internet with
            less danger of viruses and Trojan horses
         -  use cryptographically strong techniques to preserve file
            integrity
         -  scale well in the Internet community
         -  minimize effort on the part of the users
         -  use existing infrastructure and standards
    Betsi is a free, experimental service.  It requires use of PGP to verify
    signatures from Betsi.  Betsi's public key is widely available.  It  can
    be  obtained  from numerous public key servers by requesting the key for
    certify or Betsi. It also appears in a  paper  that  was  submitted  for
    publication,  in the help file (described in a moment) and at the end of
    this message.
    For  additional  information  on Betsi send mail to certify at bellcore.com
    with subject, help.
    A  copy  of  the paper describing Betsi can be obtained by anonymous ftp
    from thumper.bellcore.com in the directory /pub/certify.  A copy of  the
    public  key  for  Betsi can also be found there.  It is recommended that
    the key be obtained from at least two different places and compared.

@_subject: US Government Cryptographic Interfaces Meeting 
I attach some (unofficial) notes on a recent meeting sponsored by          the US government. Comments welcome.
         - pvm
         Ps. As I am in San Jose this week, I will try to get to the          10DEC94 Bay Area CP meeting where I can briefly talk about it if          there is any interest.
         -----
         Report from 01DEC94 NIST Cryptographic API Meeting
         On 01DEC94, NIST (a branch of the US Department of Commerce)          convened an "information sharing and discussion" meeting on          Cryptographic APIs (CAPI) at Gaithersburg.
         Present were "leaders in the field of computer cyptography". Some          well known figures present were Steve Walker, Dorothy Denning,          Burt Kaliski, Warwick Ford, and Miles Smid. Government attendees          included 7 from the NSA, 4 from NIST, 5 from the UK MoD, 2 from          NASA, and 2 from ARPA. In addition to RSA Labs, BNR, and TIS -          other vendors present included Spyrus, IBM, HP, Novell, Microsoft,          Datakey, Racal-Guardata, Uptronics, Bankers Trust, National          Semiconductor, and myself representing the X/Open (vendor          consortium) Security Working Group.
         The meeting heard presentations on initiatives relating to          cryptographic APIs. These comprised:
         - International Cryptographic Experiment (ICE)
         - MoD Security in Open Systems Technical Demonstrator Programme
         - X/Open Cryptographic Service Model
         - ANS1 X9F1 Layered Cryptographic Service Model
         - POSIX Cryptographic Study Group
         - GSS-API
         - NIST Cryptographic Service Calls  draft FIPS
         - NSA CAPI Goals, Architecture, and Requirements
         - Royal Holloway University of London CAPI Study
         - RSA Labs PKCS11          - IBM Generic Cryptographic Interface
         - BNR/NT Entrust Interface
         - Spyrus
         Copies of the slides, and the X/Open draft preliminary          specification were distributed to the attendees.
         I received some unsolicited positive feedback on the X/Open          Security Working Group's output from a number of the attendees,          and also three requests to join the group. It was a useful          validation that X/Open are proceeding down the right track.
         There was discussion during the meeting on the correct scope for          CAPIs, and a debate on the market pressures towards convergence.
         Two specific threads of activity were identified:
         1)standards coordination looks containable given the cooperative
           and positive attitude among representatives of ANSI, POSIX,
           NIST, and X/Open. I believe that NIST and the vendor community
           through X/Open can work together to get agreement on an            interface which meets the requirements, is grounded in
           implementation experience;
         2)implementation experience with CAPIs, and associated effort to
           shift export control policy will be enabled as part of the
           International Cryptographic Experiment.
         Timely completion of a cross-industry cryptographic interface, and          in parallel its validation in real systems, will then lead to a          firm basis for international agreement.

@_subject: GUCAPI 
A few comments on GUCAPI postings follow.
1. It has been suggested that GSS-API is appropriate for layering over PGP
security functions, but this is incorrect, as GSS-API is inappropriate
for store-and-forward applications (and associated security
mechanisms), and hence isn't suitable for all applications which
have security requirements.
2. The application level interfaces for messaging applications must include
object protection semantics. One proposal being considered for this is
available by ftp as draft-ietf-cat-iop-gss-00.txt from ds.internic.net in
CP IETF correspondent(s) may want to report on.
3. A distinction can and should be made between the higher level interfaces
which combine information protection and authentication, and the
lower level interfaces to cryptographic transforms and key exchanges
which aren't bundled with any trust model or certification 4. The lower level cryptographic interfaces (CAPIs) are the subject of
numerous proposals. A few of these were listed in the note I sent to the
list yesterday about the recent NIST meeting. One proposal being developed by major vendors (IBM, HP, Sun etc) and to be trialled in
practical implementations is available from X/Open, together with an associated email discussion list. Mail me if you want to be part
of the review process, or just track developments in this area. (This
is intended to be a net standard and an industry standard :-).

This is unfair. NIST have made efforts to work in both US, and international
industry groups on crypto APIs. For example NIST are represented this week
(here) along with IBM, HP, Novell, Olivetti, Bull, ICL, Amdahl, SCO, Sun,
SNI, Andersens etc at the X/Open Security Working Group.
The NIST draft FIPS has already been contributed, along with other inputs from industry and government such as the draft X.9 Layered API for
Cryptographic Modules, IBM crypto APIs, Mosaic Interface Control
document, SESAME Basic Cryptographic APIs, Olivetti Cryptographic
APIs (etc), as input to X/Open.
I recall that the NIST crypto APIs work was also presented to IEEE POSIX
last year.
I guess more black than "real".
The following are the main paremeters for the Encipher primitive:
 identifier   1 selects DES, 2 selects Skipjack
 mode         ECB, CBC, cipher feedback, output feedback
 plaintext
 key
 iv
 feedback     number of bits

@_subject: (re-tx) RE: Transparent Email (WAS disable telnet to port 25) 
I sent this yesterday, but it apparently didn't through.
Existing standards track RFCs support PEM-based security of RFC-822
email (RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424).
Recent work on security of MIME has allowed for an alternative content
protection and certification mechanism (i.e. PGP). See Internet Drafts
draft-ietf-pem-sigenc-02.txt and draft-ietf-pem-mime-07.txt which respectively define the framework and the PEM-specific parts.
The intent of the MIME extensions is to enable either PGP or PEM to be used,
although the standard for the former is I believe still pending. I am
not aware of efforts to integrate the two certification mechanisms.
This is the function for the IPRA (as discussed in RFC 1422).
This is what a PEM-conformant user agent does.
The PEM WG used to call these organisational notaries, but they have been
dropped from the standards. They are also referred to in related work as
Local Registration Agents or Authorities - and are necessary for large
organisations' use of certification services.
This sounds similar to the certification message in RFC 1424. There isn't
a requirement for certificate retrieval as certificates are sent with the
message or handled using (as yet unspecified) directory facilities -
probably an extended DNS in the Internet environment.
