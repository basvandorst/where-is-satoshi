On 8/22/93 Harry Bartholomew mentioned a new "secure voice" product from
SVC in College Station, TX. Does anyone have more info on this product, ie
a phone number?
Question: He states that they offer "lifetime upgrades" but also that they
do not mantain cust. records (for privacy), so how does one find out about
new releases. Wouldn't one need to "poll the company" to learn of a new
release and wouldn't that turn into a headache for the company? (Assuming
they've sold significant numbers)
