Hm.  We seem to have a duplication of effort here.  I am currently working
with s_duck at pinetree.org on the same sort of thing that you describe.
Right now we're having problems fooling DOS with the virtual EXE.  However,
the encryption algorithm used is IDEA -- the same one as PGP uses.
I suggest we pool our efforts and swap ideas/source code.

Development of the EXE encrypting package that s_duck at pinetree.org
and I were working on has effectivly stalled.  We were unable to wedge
DOS at the right level to virtualize an .exe file.  Sorry for getting
your hopes up.  If anyone wishes to continue the project, please
ask s_duck for the existing code.

@_subject: Random OTP sources 
Much discussion has been going on about creating a truly random OTP key by tuning in to dead TV channels, etc.  There is a much simpler, and more secure way.   Look at the decay of a small radioactive source.  Find a time period in which
there is a 50% chance of seeing an event, and then clock a 1 if you do, or a
0 of you don't.  Radioactive sources and detectors are easily obtained from
smoke detectors, and it should be fairly easy to set up (though I havn't done
it).  If our understanding of quantum mechanics are correct, the resulting bitstream is truly random.  RF noise may be random.  Also, if the NSA or
other Big Brother organization knows what you are doing, they can try listening
in on the same channel and deducing your key.  To my knowledge, there is no
way to see what is going on in a small Californium source if you have more
than a few meters between the source and detector.  Anyhow, a given event
will probably only produce one particle, or maybe two, so your point detector
will only see a portion of the events and knowledge of particles in another
direction doesn't tell you anything.
Hm.  I hope that was coherent.  Any comments?

@_subject: Radio-isotope OTP generators 
I got some mail from someone on the list who told me that about a year ago
there had been much discussion of radio-isotope OTP random number generators,
and that the conclusion had been that they were too dangerous to use.  I replied
to that message, but my reply bounced for some reason.  So, could anybody please
send me a synopsis of the discussion?  Thanks.
I was talking to my father about this, and we concluded that a simple exposed-
silicon photodiode put in reverse bias should provide adequate detection.
Put it in darkness, and no current will flow.  Hit it with and alpha, and you
get a cascade on the order of a million electrons.  The alpha source need
only be some radium paint on the front of the diode.  This is not dangerous
stuff.  You'd have to go very far out of your way to do yourself any damage
with it.  If you eat it then bad things might happen, but I can say the same
thing about AA batteries...
My father designs and builds particle detectors for a living, so he probably
knows what he's talking about.
BTW: one error in my last message.  There is not Californium in a smoke
detector, it is Amerecium.  Same difference...

Yup, the 3 microcurie source makes sense.  With a pair of diodes we could make the detector 4 pi, but no big deal.  3 microcuries is not a problem
health-wise as long as you don't eat it.  As it's an alpha source, any shiledingor even a few centimeters of air will stop the rays.  Howerver, I just encountered a new angle on it.  According to my father, that's on the order of $100
worth of radium :(.  If we're willing to go with a much slower source, we can
use thorium which is only $2 per gram or so.  Alternativly, anyone have an old clock with a radium dial? BTW: Cosmic ray background is only 1 event per square foot per minute.  Plus,
they occur in showers.  So that isn't going to work.

Yes, you can get Thorium from lamp nets.  A simpler way is to get it from
welding rods.  They are 40% thorium.  More than one unsespecting lab
technician has welded together an ultrasensitive detector with them, only
to find it not working for some reason

Yes, I have heard of using diodes for white noise production.  Hoewver, I am
conserned as to the nature of this noise.  Is it some property of the silicon
or is it just amplified radio noise that is bringing the diode above

@_subject: xor data hiding? 
What you are talking about sounds like the original Vernam cipher that Dave
Kahn talks about in _CodeBreakers_.  There, he was using a teletype with two XORing tapes.  One tape was 1000 characters long, the other was 999.  Thus,
999000 characters would have to go past before the system repeated.  HOWEVER,
once it does repeat, all security is compromized.  Even before that time,
I believe there are subtle attacks you can use based on the repetition of the keys.  So, this is not a secure cipher method.  I would personally suggest tacking an 128 bit IDEA key onto 4dos.com instead.  Or use
DES even.
BTW: Though you could come up with a 30Kb+ string which when XORed would
give you any plaintext, you could not come up with a few small strings
which when used over each other would give you that.  There just isn't enough
information to make that possible.

Canada now uses holograms on its $20, $50, $100 and $1000 bills.
They're a small patch on the top right hand corner that looks like gold foil.
Written on this foil is the denomination of the bill (20, 50, &c).  As the
viewing angle is changed, the color of this writing shifts.
Obviously, this will blow a photocopier out of the water.  I have minimal
experience in holography, but it would also seem to be difficult to print
one on a metal foil.

An encrypted cypherpunks list?  Why?  To try and hide the forum's messages
from the TLAs?  I'm sure they already have people readin this list who'd
be incorporated into the encrypted list too.  Or do you plan to verify
each reader before giving them the password or whatever?  I fail to see
the point.

@_subject: hardware RNG 
Cypherpunks, A while back there was lots of discussion in the list about hardware
random number generation.  The consensus was that diode white noise
was the easiest thing to use.  It probably is, but I havn't been able to
persuade a single diode to be noisy yet.  Anyhow, I turned to the simplest
white noise source that I have, which happens to be a radio tuned to a dead
channel.  I hooked that up to a home made interface board that has previously
served as a frame grabber, and wrote some software to grab random numbers.
The hardware compares the signal to four known voltages, and sets the feedback
pins on my printer port correspondingly.  Thus, I get a nibble of information
every cycle.  However, it's fairly interrelated (if the high bit is set, the
low ones must be set too, &c).  So, this is the scheme I came up with to
randomize it.
Read two nibbles and concatenate them into a byte.  Take the parity of this
byte to give you one bit.  Read eight bits this way, to make one byte.
Read 128 bytes by this method, and take a MD5 hash of this data.  Use the 16
byte message digest as the final random bitstream.  Do this as many times
as needed to get the desired number of bytes.
Using the ENTROPY1 software submitted to the list by Peter Meyer, I determined
that a 1000000 byte file had a relative entropy of 0.999980.  This seems
close enough to 1 for cryptographical use.  For each bit of output, 64 bits
have been read from the device.  The MD5 transposition should eliminate all
of the wave nature of the signal and make adjacent bytes unrelated.
So, the question now is, is it safe?  An obvious method of attack is to simply
connect an identical device to a radio and grab identical data.  However, I
feel this is unfeasible.  Radio noise is omnidirectional and thus (I think)
should give you very different signals at different geographic locations due
to the different phases of the various sources.  There are too many variables
in the hardware itself.  What frequency is it at?  What are the comparison
values set to?  What other method could be used to attack this except for the
obvious tempest attack on the host computer?

I have a friend who wrote a gadget called EXELOCK.  It will throw
a password stub into the front of an of an EXE file.  Now, I'm sure
it doesn't use encryption but just compares the hash of the password to
a stored value.  However, I'm sure an IDEA or DES version could be implemented. As for compression, no need to re-invent the wheel.  Simply run pklite
and then run the new EXELOCK on the result.
I'll contact this person and see if I can lay my hands on the  source
code for the gadget.

Can anyone point me to a detailed description

@_subject: DC-nets 
My thanks to Tim Newsham and Tim May for sending me information
on DC-networks.  It appears the modifications that I had been
thinking about were not discussed by Chaum in his original
paper, which gives me some hope I may have stumbled across
something new.
Chaum proposes the use of public key cryptography for secure
communication between vertices in a DC-net.  This leads to the
problem of secure key exchange, and the possibility that the
public key algorithm is not sound.
Instead, the interference properties of a DC-net may be used
to give unconditional security.  Say Alice wishes to send a message
M to Bob.
1.  Alice computes the hash of M, and appends it to M to
produce a packet P of p bits.
2.  Alice transmits on the net "Message of p bits for Bob"
3.  Bob receives this message, and prepares a packet R composed
    of p random bits.
4.  Alice transmits packet P.  Simultaniously, Bob transmits
    packet R.  The output of the DC�net is now X, where
    X = P XOR R
5.  Bob, computes P = X XOR R.  He verifies that the last bits of
    P are a valid hash for the first portion.  If so, he has
    succesfully recieved M and the transfer is over.  If not,
    there must have been interference from another party.  He
    would then transmit "Alice, resend message", and the
    procedure would be repeated.
All that Carol, another vertex in the net, can see is X.  She
cannot derive P from X as it has been encrypted with the
equivalent of a one-time pad.  Thus, P is unconditionally
Alice and Bob need no nothing about each other for this transfer
to work.  Indeed, Alice and Bob may well be pseudonyms.  The worst
that can happen is that two sites respond to the pseudonym of Bob,
and the transfer suffers from interference.  Hence the built in
hash.  Note that only Bob can see the valid hash, and only then
if the transfer has worked perfectly.  Thus, the hash need not
be secure.
I have not looked at the efffects of collusion on this protocol.
My gut feeling is that sufficient collusion would bring it down
in flames.  However, this is also true of the basic operation
of a DC-net.
I cannot claim that I came up with this protocol alone.  It was
concieved this summer at a seminar I taught on cryptography.
After sitting around a table and flipping coins to prove that
it actually did work, we started looking at the problems of
un-intentional interference.  This is the result of half an
hour of me trying to remember what little I had read of DC-nets
and the students making me look like a fool for not having
studied as much as I should have.
So, my first question to you is, does it work?  The next
question is has it been thought of before?  And finally,
is it useful?
