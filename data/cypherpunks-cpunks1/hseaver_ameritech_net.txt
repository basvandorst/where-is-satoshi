And what has happened as a result is that for the most part it has become
almost useless, unless you happen to be able to get an ISP with enough
diskspace. My current ISP, ameritech, for all it's other faults, has the best
newservers I've had access to in 5 years. There's literally *months* old posts
on there, so you can follow whole threads.
      Most other ISPs keep a week, or less. Understandable, but worthless for
the tech groups. I really wish they'd split usenet up-- take the binary junk
elsewhere, although most ISPs will tell you it's the binarys that most of the
customer base want, not the techie info.

I think you're getting a little off-track here --- the original
discussion was about whether the court could make the journalist turn
over *all copies* of a document. She wasn't trying to destroy them to
hide anything,
      As others have stated, if you don't keep logs, or throw away all
your reciepts, there's not jack they can do about it --- the interesting
question is whether or not they can somehow expect you to turn over
*all* copies of a document you've published on freenet or mojo. And
whether they are encrypted or not is irrelevant.
      Although really, the most serious question everyone should be
asking is why the court wants "all" copies.

Exactly! But even for the court to order "the original and all copies" is a bit
absurd -- how could they possibly determine how many is "all"? And what the heck is
the "original" in this day and age? Most of the stuff I (and surely the vast
majority of writers and journalists these days) create is just bits and bytes. You
want the printed "original" -- gee, I've never printed one, but I will if you want
me to -- how many "originals" do you want, and how many "copies"?
     Frankly, even I couldn't be *really, really* sure I had given them "all
copies" -- I've got zipped files floating around all over the place, on backup
tapes, stored on various machines, servers around the net, floppies in boxes I'll
find years later, etc.
        Or even disseminate it in encrypted form that the jury can't read, so what?
The info is still protected from seizure, as it's beyond anyone's reach to retrieve
"all copies". In some cases it might be provident to openly publish the info, in
others not. I would think that in the case in question, someone in the jailed
journalist's immediate circle would have already made copies and secreted them
away, out of reach of the court. Maybe someone should tip them off to freenet/mojo.
         Careful -- I got called a village idiot for suggesting essentially the
same thing.

And not even really Judeo, just rednecked Christian. Ancient Judaism was
polygamous, as anyone who can read the Old Testament knows. And it wasn't just
the "shamanic drug rituals" of native americans that was banned -- *ALL*
religious practices were banned for many decades. Many indigenous people were
killed simply for engaging in religious dancing -- Sun Dance and Ghost Dance
in particular, but all other spiritual worship was banned as well.
     Not only native americans, but many others are banned from practicing
their religion -- Hindu and Rastafarian use of ganga, for example. Santeria,
Vodun, and like african/earth based religions are regularly persecuted,
likewise Wicca and Druidism. Don't even mention Satanism. None of the last few
mentioned are allowed on military bases, for example, and Dubbya, asked about
this during the campaign, said they weren't "real" religions. Police raid
ceremonies in many localities.

What stopped the war was explicity the growing violence (SDS's Bring the War

most of the time all the council members are from the newer burbs where the
more affluent live. The city council then elects the mayor. This is a city of

So right -- all these people talking about "it had to be a big, well
funded, well organized group with lots of resources" are talking total nonsense.
It could have been a tiny cadre of eight or twelve people with no more money
than to buy some plane tickets. Flying a plane doesn't take a heck of lot
either, once it's in the air. It's not even that hard taking off -- landing is
the bitch.
        What would be so hard about getting past security if they used plastic
knives -- those zytel daggers sold all over the place would be pretty damn
effective. I would imagine that they wouldn't have just threatened with them
anyway, they would have just used them and killed the crew quickly. A plastic
knife would be all they needed, and no metal detector would spot that.

@_subject: Carnivore Early Deployment 
In light of the apparent widespread deployment of
carnivore at many, if not most, US ISP's, without, I
presume, any sort of warrants, does anyone know of any
proposals for lawsuits against same by EFF, ACLU, or anyone
else? This would certainly be an abrogation of civil rights
for all of us whose email is being intercepted without even
the remotest probable cause. I would think it ripe for a
class action suit.
        I'm assuming that ameritech knuckled under, although
I've not seen any announcements of it, but last night when
trying to pop mail from their server, I was getting no
connection for quite awhile, then suddenly I got a message
saying the "account is locked by another session or for
maintenance" -- something I've never, ever seen before,
although ameritech certainly has had a lot of problems with
it's mail servers. Then again this morning, for over an
hour, the incoming stuff just stopped. We sent several test
messages from various servers, none of them arrived until
much, much later.
       Not that I'm paranoid, I seriously doubt they'd be
monitoring my mail in particular, but I would also assume
that any installation of something like carnivore would
cause problems with the mail at an already rather fragile
entity like ameritech.

Of course, I just meant being singled out for "special treatment" any
more than the rest of you. Obviously we are being monitored/sniffed/etc.
And probably this will increase. At any rate, the question still stands: Is
any legal action being proposed against this? I'd certainly like to be part
of any  class action suit, although I have little monetary resources to

I'll try again, not as an attachment.

...hope this is not too off-topic...
...this maybe just coincidence and/or caused by other
reasons (maybe some
well read web referee?)... but it seems that after the
US-event of
09/11/2001 the accesses went up for 2 prominent
cryptographic linux
packages; are we getting more paranoid?
..any ideas?

Actually, they do. At least in ant terms they do.  Some ants build
extremely high (relative to their size) towers, others build in trees,
bushes, etc. And they communicate, very well in fact, and use boats, fight
wars, farm, herd, have slaves - in short pretty much everything humans do,
albeit a bit differently. We can only conjecture about whether they have
religion, literature (could be at least oral tradition literature), music,
and the like, but I certainly wouldn't doubt it.
        Although when ants build hi-rises, it's for a good, sound,
environmental reason.
