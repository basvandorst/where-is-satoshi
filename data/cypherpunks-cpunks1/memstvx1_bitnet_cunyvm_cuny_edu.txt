                        Abstract
A superpolylogarithmic subexponential function is any function that
asymptotically grows faster than any polynomial of any logarithm but
slower than any exponential.  We present a recently discovered
nineteenth-century manuscript about these functions, which in part
because of their applications in cryptology, have received
considerable attention in contemporary computer science research.
Attributed to the little-known yet highly-suspect
composer/mathematician Maria Poopings, the manuscript can be sung to
the tune of ``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'' from the musical
Mary Poppins.  In addition, we prove three ridiculous facts about
superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions.  Using novel extensions
to the popular DTIME notation from complexity theory, we also define
the complexity class SuperPolyLog/SubExp, which consists of all
languages that can be accepted within deterministic
superpolylogarithmic subexponential time.  We show that this class is
notationally intractable in the sense that it cannot be conveniently
described using existing terminology.  Surprisingly, there is some
scientific value in our notational novelties; moreover, students may
find this paper helpful in learning about growth rates, asymptotic
notations, cryptology, and reversible computation.
Keywords. Algorithms, asymptotic notation, complexity theory,
cryptography, cryptology, DTIME, mathematical humor, Maria Poopings,
Mary Poppins, musical computer science, reversible computation,
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, superpolylogarithmic
subexponential functions, SuperPolyLog/SubExp.

            Superpolylogarithmic Subexponential Functions
    (Sung to the tune of ``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'')
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions!
Faster than a polylog but slower than exponential.
Even though they're hard to say, they're truly quintessential.
Superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
For Alice to send a message through to Bob when Eve's eavesdropping,
do use a trapdoor one-way function---not a one-key mapping.
First take a message x, let's say, and raise it to the e;
then mod it out by p times q but keep these secretly.  Oh!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
The process takes but poly-time and appears to be secure:
why even just a single bit is one over polylog pure.
Though Alice thinks that Eve must spend time at least exponential,
by using Lenstra's elliptic curves, Eve splits n subexponentially.  Oh!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
we remove the heat with water but there's a better strategy.
Since thermodynamics does not apply when info is not doomed,
the laws of physics don't require that power be consumed.  Oh!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Now Bennett said in `73, to run a program P,
you simulate the program P, but do so reversibly.
The problem with this method is that space is exponential,
so trade off time to save on space---this really is essential! Oh!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Did you know if you invert one, you get a
funtionential subexporithmic logapolyrepus?
But that's quite a singularity!  So,
If you are in an oral exam and cannot find the way,
just summon up these words and then you've got a lot to say.
But better use them carefully or you could fail the test.
A professor once asked me,
``What do you call functions that grow faster than any
polylogarithm but slower than exponential?'' There're,
Superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions!
Superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions!
Superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions!
Superpolylogarithmic subexponential functions!

@_subject: abusing the system? 
One of the newsgroups I was reading have this persistant "tester" who
uses the anon service in Finland.  Anyway, there were several different
postings, all with different ids, but same kinds of "this is a test, nyah nyah"
        As I was one of those "stop it" people, and seeing more of the same
bullshit by that guy, I got slightly pissed off, and started thinking.  Already
that person is using about 3 different anonymous ids.  If he is introduced to
the remailers here, conceivably he could generate more anonymous ids for
himself (ie, kill files won't work then, unless you want to kill a whole site)
by routing his mail thru the remailers.  Each remailer would give him another
userid at that anon service.  And if he uses it to loop back to the
remailers...  And then loop to that Australian anon service... and so on.  He
could "legitimately" have a hundred or so different anon_ids, from one original
        What if someone who realises this was to use that capability to post
some really "colorful" material to news?  Suddenly you have a hundred or so
weirdos posting "I want nude pictures of a gerbil, please" to alt.binaries.
pictures.erotica... you get the idea.  Is there anyway to stop this from
happening?  And this is on top of the real weirdos (ie, those who know how to
post anonymously, like most of the readers of this list... :))
        So far, the net has functioned as it's own sieve with regards to the
"weirdos" but if the remailers is generally available (as it should be!), the
potential for abuse is much much greater.  Any way to slow it down?  "Hey,
look, a flame war, let's join in..."
        Of course, if someone was to forge a mail to the anon service... don't
even need to know about the remailers...  but with forged mail, the anon
service can at least "check" to see the validity of your address.
        I realise that this is probably not important in the overall scheme of
things... but I am curious about what can be done to reduce such potential
        Ciao.
ps:  Any tips on tracing anonymous mail and newspostings?  I mean beyond the
"from" and "path" things... ie, trace to the userid...  Someone tried to forge
a posting in my name... (yes, that's what got me thinking :))

@_subject: Question about the MacPGP 
About the MacPGP, isn't it possible to sort of write a script addon
to the various telecoms software?  What I mean is that when you start reading
mail, you click somewhere, and all input from the modem is translated direct
by the script so that you can read the plaintext.  But when you reply, you will
have to use the telecoms' editor and upload the text...
        Somewhat like that rot13 thing in news really (or the VMS implemantation
of it).
     Ciao.

@_subject: is this true??? 
I found this post in a newsgroup that I try to follow.  Don't know
about etiquette about how this should have been edited, so it's all here,
headers and all.  Anyway, I would like to know if the info is accurate, bull or
        FYI, the ISA means Internal Security Act (back in Malaysia) and they
have had UUCP for a few years (but UUCP's hardly enough for the kinds of
traffic they are talking about, but then a few private companies *did* have
full Internet, so..... it's possible that the "thingy" was there without public

        sorry about the previous post.  The mailer cut off
everything after any "--" line, which I used to separate the

        When in doubt, assume they will (or for that matter, have been).
In fact, Malaysia has *ALWAYS* been capable of monitoring Usenet news since a
long time ago, since Malaysia has long been connected via UUCP, which is
capable of providing a news feed.
        Included below is an article that appeared in alt.bbs.allsysop.
It's source has NOT been validated.   It is included here for your

EVIDENCE.   The possibility of the scenerio described in the article
happening is up for debate.
