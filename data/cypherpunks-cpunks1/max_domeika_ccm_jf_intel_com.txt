@_subject: Problem building PGP on NT 
First question:  Is this the appropriate place to go with this kind of question.  If not, I apologize.  Anyways here goes:    I'm trying to build PGP, the MIT version under windows NT using Microsoft C++ version 4.0.  The program builds after a few modifications to the makefile but cannot generate a RSA key.  Everytime, I type pgp -kg and answer the required questions, pgp attempts to generate some primes and apparently fails.  Anyone have a clue as to what the problem may be???
  I know there is an executable of PGP for NT already made, I've used it.  So I at least know it's possible to build on NT.  Anyone else attempt a port to NT???
Thanks ahead of time,
