I'm new to the list, but after reading the article in Wired I felt I
needed to hear all this, Nazi flames aside.
I run linux myself and I'd like to see your idea take root.

hmm...it sounds interesting...I'm not directly "on the wire" unfortunately
but if you need help with some code and can stand a newbie to Unix C (i
taught myself C in DOS and about 4 months changed to Linux) I'd be happy
to help if/when I can.
