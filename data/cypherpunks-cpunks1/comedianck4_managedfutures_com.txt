and i love it (thanks, coco). have a happy st. patrick's day. my happy little life
i mean, look at her hair. when she does these weekends she fills up really fast so don't wait- if you need color and/or cut and/or face waxing at very reasonable prices email her promptly and she'll get you booked and give you directions. i am so grateful for quiet time with the scriptures.
but then again, we looove roadtrips.
wooohoooo!" may the light always find you on a dreary day.
i love that she's an expert knitter and yet chooses to create very simple pieces; 2. to keep the bedrooms clear i throw all the dirty laundry in the laundry room and shut the door. out of sight, out of mind! like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. when you need to be home, may you find your way.
really really happy.
have you seen april's ms living yet? i LOVE this picture and am so inspired to keep the needles moving. i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making. i love her style. i am looking forward to a date with grant.
