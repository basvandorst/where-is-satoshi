winner comes down to the person or persons least wrong since every
description given so far is an attempt to extend some part of an incomplete picture in a way that is _WRONG_, leading to arguments
about misstatements.

scattering and the first experiments that demonstrated this is where
scattering gets its name: Compton scattering. The compton scattering
formula is easily derived from conservation of 4-momentum. Reflection
from a mirror is easily described by maxwell's equations, but is more
difficult in terms of photons. While the description of the photoelectric
effect is more or less ok, the term "thermalize" means applies to contimuum scattering of electrons in the conduction band through collisions
with other electrons, not to discrete transitions. Describing a reflection
as scattering can be done, but not in the length of this response.

by Jackson, as a definitive reference. It's the canonical physics text on
the subject and is practically universal as the text for a first year
graduate course in any physics program. If you know anyone that's
a physicist, they should have a copy.

scattering from a surface will be scattered in an arbitrary direction with
the appropriate change in energy. A _reflection_ is the collective behaviour
of photons with particular energies that particular interact with the
conduction electrons in a way which is easy to describe with maxwell's
equatiions, but not very easy to describe photon by photon, since from a
miscroscopic view, reflection is a statisitical phenomena. For example,
gold which is fairly thin, will be transparent in the UV, not reflective.

A charge is at rest in its own rest frame before the absorption and
after the absorption. How would it retain any knowledge of its previous
state without (hint) communicating with neighboring charges?

by virtue of the uncertainty principle between the number of photons
and the phases. The ones you count are the properly symmetrized linear
combination that produces the signal in the detector and that is always
equivalent to a single photon. So the above statement is meaningless.

it's meaningless to talk in terms of photon numbers except in a very
specific context where one recognizes the limitations and applicability
of the picture.

account. Apparently, scientific accuracy is not the thrust of the posts, I'm not particularly good at being politically correct and since I thought this had something to do with cryptography, there's not much reason for me to interrupt any
more squabbles.
