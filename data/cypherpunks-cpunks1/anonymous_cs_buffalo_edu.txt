@_subject: Remailer changes. 
I have taken similar precautions with my remailer...  as you can tell
from the header lines.  I'm still having trouble convincing my system
adminstrator to install PGP v2.1 (or even v2.0).  For some reason, he
seems to be ignoring my messages.  Since I only have a limited
knowledge of C, I really don't know how to fiddle around with the PGP
*.C source files too much, otherwise, I would install it myself.  The error that I keep getting running under SunOS version 4.1.3 is:
make all CC=gcc LD=gcc OBJS_EXT=sparc.o \
CFLAGS="-O -fpcc-struct-return -DUNIX -DHIGHFIRST -DIDEA32"
gcc -O -fpcc-struct-return -DUNIX -DHIGHFIRST -DIDEA32  -target sun4 -c  pgp.c
In file included from pgp.c:109:
:0: previous declaration of `abort'
:0: previous declaration of `exit'
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `pgp.o'
Current working directory /tmp/pgp21/src
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `sun4gcc'
If anyone can help me out, please e-mail me *DIRECTLY* and not to the list.

Ok, I have finally decided that my remailer is ready for public use.
I think I have finally worked all the bugs out of it enough so that
it runs very smooth.
In case you want to write something to me...
Here is my *own* PGP key.  Rajesh (Rusty) Babani - babani at cs.buffalo.edu

The address where I am running an anonymous remailing server based on
Eric Hughes' perl scripts is: To use the server, put "Request-Remailing-To: "
into the header of the message, and send it to the server address.  If
your mailer won't let you put things into message headers, instead make
the first line of your message body be just the two characters "::",
and make the next line be "Request-Remailing-To: ",
and make the next line be blank.  The "::" tells the remailer to take
the following lines, up to a blank one, and put them into the header.
Also, make sure that you include a subject: line in your message,
otherwise, the messge will be sent to a black hole.  You will not hear
from the message again.
To use PGP with the remailer, first compose a message like above then
encrypt the message using the remailer's public key.  Then, in the
message body, make the first line be just the two characters "::", and
make the next line be "Encrypted: PGP" and make the next line be

@_subject: Test the new remailer 
I encourage everyone to at least send a test message through the
remailer so that I can lay my fears thtat the reamailer is not working
down to rest.
Not only that... it's really easy.  Try it!

Bob Stratton stated in the last message:
This is correct in the same way I can see that the message sent from you
was sent from intercon.com -> cygnus.com -> toad.com -> me

@_subject: whistleblower newsgroup? 
Excellent idea. I am a government official who has blown the whistle on several major abuses, and have trusted friends in the media. I can see to it that if alt.whistleblowers becomes real, it will be read.
Submissions should be to a mailbox that renders the articles anonymous before they go public. There might be an alt.whistleblowers.d for discussion where members of the press could (here's where crypto-tech comes in) post requests for further information. PGP (or whatever) sigs could serve as press "credentials" and interested reporters could post their public keys to a trusted repository.
This has a lot of merit.
Since we know that the press is the only effective means by which a tale of government abuse can be told, this could change the way government does business, knowing that honest people have nothing to fear by pointing out the crooks. I've seen it happen ... makes you feel good.

Attention deadbeat...
I'm getting two copies of your postings to cypherpunks from both
anon.penet.fi and from nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu.
One copy is enough.

There was a mention uptopic of ANI "demo" numbers. Anyone have one of
them kicking about?
