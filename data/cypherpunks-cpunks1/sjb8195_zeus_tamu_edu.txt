I read Mark's reply to Sandy's post.  I believe it was well thought.
I was interested in knowing more though.  Please tell me more about the
secret banks that exist today.  I would like to hear about the time honored
techniques for cash funelling.  I am sure that we all have some familarity
with the different power groups that exist, and the games they play.  Are
these groups secure?  Are their methods efficient, accessible, secret, and
widely accepted?  How can I use this old system if I chose to today?  That
would be my real interest.
I think that digital banks are very needed.  I think they are feasible.
I even think that some power groups might start using them as opposed to the
old ways (whatever those ways are!)  There are many different kinds of
digital money systems possible.  I would suggest to Sandy that any work in
the area defintely continue.  The Net today is only an infant.  We all know
what is coming.  There seems to be a real need for a secure economic system
for it.
Mark has very valid points about what other technologies are needed in the
privacy arena.  I completely agree with him that many other problems must be
solved as well.  I think Mark views crypto technology with a good perspective.
There is much more than technology involved.
I am including the rest of Mark's post:

Hello cypherpunks,
Please consider my suggestions.  Send flames via anonymous remail to /dev/null.
I would like to see the following discussions end:
  1.  Attacks on Dr. Denning.  (She is only an opponent, not Damien Thorn.)
  2.  Defense of Dr. Denning.  (More important topics exist.)
  3.  Attacks of Ross Perot or his supporters.    4.  Attacks on each other.
I am more interested in these topics:
  1.  Corporations, money, and IRS.  Sandy and others.
  2.  Rating systems.
  3.  Phone and fax security.
  4.  Clipper chip news.
  5.  Security software news.  PGP Tools, etc.
These ideas are simply my opinion.  There is too much talent on this group
to throw at flames.  Casually yours,
Scott Beaudreau
