Philippe Nave posted:
    The recent posting by Scott Collins about his remailer and the
    copyright incident illustrates several problems with the remailer
    system as I see it.
    In my mind, then, the solution to these problems requires
    remailers that leave *no trace* of message origins, including the
    address of the remailer itself.  If this is not possible, then I
    for one will employ other means for anonymous communication.
No matter what the remailer operator does, the node he sends remailed
msgs -to- is going to add a net header revealing where the msg came
- -from-, so absolute untraceability seems impossible. But there are
some things we could do to make tracing more difficult.
Although we can't effect the net headers added -after- we forward a
msg, we could certainly add a chain of fictitious net headers to
the msg -before- we forward it (after removing the real net headers
which is done already) which would indicate a false location for the
remailer, leaving the real remailer node appearing as only an
intermediate net node.
The last fictitious node could be a UUCP account which always calls
you to exchange mail, so all the info in your UUCP map could be phony.
The person offended by E-mail can come to you and you can pretend to
cooperate by giving him the phony info.  If he comes back after his
wild goose chase, you can say, "you mean that SOB gave me a phony
address, etc.?  Thanks for letting me know; I'll cancel his UUCP
account immediately!" Then just change the phony net chain to
something else.
Another technique is to receive mail to be forwarded at one address
(the public remailer address) but forward it from another. This is
easy to do with two (or more) UUCP accounts.
The remailer operator himself can have a policy of accepting UUCP
accounts and not checking the phone number or location.
Finally, it's a good thing to have remailers in different national
jurisdictions. Currently the only Cypherpunks remailer not in the USA
   remail at extropia.wimsey.com
in Canada.  We need more remailers in more countries.  Places like
Hong Kong or Russia, which don't give a shit about copyrights. Denmark
or Holland, which don't give a shit about kiddy porn.

    Maybe, but the state has a wonderful scam of paying off a "5 million
    dollar jackpot" over 20 years; the true value (what the same deal
    would cost you to buy as an annuity) is less than $5 M, possibly much
    less. If private outfits did this, they'd be jailed.
Yes, but the return is still 50%.

                  ^^^^^^^
    "Or even"? The numbers games almost always have much better odds than
    the State pays...that's one reason for their popularity (another is
    tax avoidance).
I've never played the numbers game myself, but I've heard that the
payoff is 600-to-1 on a 1000-to-1 bet.  That's a 60% payout, compared
to the lottery's 50%, hardly "much" better.  Compare to casino games;
Keno, 80%; Slots, 90%+; Roulette, 95%; Craps, 99%.

    Oh, I see you mentioned this scam. (Calculation should still be
    simple, as any spreadsheet can handle discounted present values and
    the like.)
Not simple for me.  If it's simple for you (or anyone reading this) I
would be interested in the results of the calculation.  Recall "x" is
either the number of times the jackpot must be passed or the nominal
value of the grand prize for which there is a positive return for the
player (assume no prize split).  You might work this out for time
values of money of 5-10-15% per annum.
    I've never played, and never plan to. Money down the drain.
I rarely play (have never won).  My wife (an ethnic Chinese) plays
weekly in a "pool" where she works.  She plays on her own when she
sees a good "omen", like finding dog shit in front of her house(!?).

    ...As for lotto, simple calculations tell anyone that the best way

Actually, if memory serves, the CA Lotto claims to return 50% of
income in prizes with the remainder divided between schools and
"administration."  Better than 30-40, but still worse than odds on any
casino game or even the "numbers racket" run by organized crime.
However, one can improve the percentage by only playing lotto after 1
or more games where there was no perfect match, as often happens,
where some of the prize money is carried over to the next game, and so
on, until eventually somebody wins the grand prize.
After some number "x" of passed games, the odds turn in favor of the
player; but not by too much since this is just when large numbers of
people play and if more than one perfect ticket is played, the prize
is split.
Calculation of "x" is not "simple", since you also have to figure in
the 20-year (with no interest) payout of large prizes.
One other tip for lotto players:  Never mark your ticket with any
recognizable pattern.  The random "quick pick" is probably best.
Reason: A pattern is equally likely to be picked at random as a "quick
pick" but much -more- likely to also be picked by some other schmuck.
So if your pattern pick wins, you're more likely to have to split the

@_subject: Use of large Keys 
Roger Bryner said,
    ...You should always take some reasonable ammount of time(say 5
    min) to encrypt your most sensitive messages, even if you have a
    12 crays and a connection machene.  The algorithim can be viewed
    as giving you an economic advantage, and worying over spending
    $.01 vs $.0001 is not just stingy, it is dangerous.
I disagree.  The problem is not time to ENcrypt, which is not much
greater for large keys than small ones. This is because the ENcryption
exponent is usually a small number, like 17.  The problem is the time
for your recipient to DEcrypt.  On my 386/SX 16mz, DEcrypting a msg
with a 4096-bit key takes 5-10 minutes.  I have a report that a
Pentium takes about 1.5 minutes. During that 5-10 minutes, many
recipients will not sit there watching grass grow, but will leave the
PC unattended to do something else.  If during that time Janet Reno's
storm troopers break through the front door, your recipient may not
have time to power-off the PC and PGP will deliver your plaintext
message right into JR's hands!  Thus in some cases use of a large key
can -reduce- security of your msg.
I haven't worked out the math, but I suspect that an 8000-bit key
is completely impractical for use on any desktop machine.
At this time, open use of a large key marks you as not using an MIT
version of PGP, thus making you a target of RSA.  This is easily
avoided by exchanging large keys and messages encrypted with large
keys "inside an envelope" of 1024-bit key encryption.

@_subject: Announcing SecureDrive 1.3d 
This is to announce the availability of Version 1.3d of SecureDrive.
SecureDrive Version 1.3d replaces version 1.3a.  A prototype version
1.3b was sent to a few people for testing.  To avoid confusion, I'm
skipping 1.3b for "official" releases.  Similarly, a version 1.3c was
released a short time ago, which did not work with 2M13 as it claimed
to do.
Changes for 1.3d have added minimal new function.  Rather I have
sought to respond to problems brought to my attention. The main
change is to support the 2M13 diskette formatter and some versions
of MSDOS which were incompatible with previous versions of SecureDrive.
See file BUGS13A.DOC for more detail of 1.3d changes.
There is also the addition of an FPART utility designed to help you
locate the physical partition parameters you can use with CRYPTDSK
and LOGIN when use of the DOS disk letter fails.
Releases 1.3, 1.3a, and 1.3d of Secure Drive are based on releases 1.0
and 1.1, mostly written by
  Mike Ingle and version 1.2, with significant new code by myself.
The code which we wrote is not copyrighted, but the program contains GNU
Copylefted code, and therefore may be freely distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence. See file COPYING for legalese.
SecureDrive provides strong encryption via the IDEA cypher (The same
symmetrical cypher used by PGP) for your files on diskettes or up to
four hard disk partitions. You encrypt your diskettes and/or HD
partitions with CRYPTDSK. Then you can access the data by using
LOGIN and SECTSR. This provides "on-the-fly" decryption (and
re-encryption) as disk sectors are accessed by your applications.
Entering LOGIN /C or powering off your PC clears the crypto keys from
memory and your encrypted disks are "instantly" secure.
Mike Ingle and I have different opinions on the distribution of
SecureDrive.  Under the GNU General License (copyleft) I do not need
Mike's permission to distribute version 1.3d and I have not asked for
same.  My policy on distribution is in the version 1.3d doc:
    Exporting this program.  Cryptography is export controlled, and
    sending this program outside the country may be illegal.  Don't do
    it.
    The "author" of versions 1.2 and 1.3, Edgar Swank, says that the
    export ban should not prevent you from placing this program on
    public BBS's and anonymous FTP sites in the US and Canada.  If
    individuals outside the US/Canada use the internet or
    international long distance to obtain copies of the program, THEY
    may be breaking US law.
    Any such foreign individuals should be aware that US law
    enforcement may legally (under US law) apprehend individuals who
    break US laws even if such individuals are not on or even have
    never been on US soil.  Such apprehension may remove such
    individuals directly to US jurisdiction without benefit of
    extradition proceedings in such individuals' home country(ies).
    This has actually happened in at least two cases, Mexico --
    suspect in murder of US drug agent, Panama -- Noriega -- indicted
    in absencia for drug smuggling.  As is well known, after a small
    war with Panama, Noriega was brought to the USA, tried and
    convicted.  He is now a guest of the US Government in a Florida
    prison.
SecureDrive Version 1.3d is already available for download on the
following public BBS's as SECDR13D.ZIP:

However, with due respect to Mike, Secure Device does -not- make
SecureDrive obsolete, at least not yet.
Certainly there is -no- reason for anyone who has already installed
SecureDrive to switch to SecureDevice. You've already partitioned your
hard disk, so you won't get the main benefit of SDev.
Although SDev has some bells & whistles of it's own, it doesn't have
(yet?) the ability to use/set PGPPASS that I added to SecureDrive, or
the ability to automatically try the hard disk key on diskettes (but
these would be easy to add).
There are some other tradeoffs between SecureDrive and Sdev.
SDev's device driver architecture makes it more compatible with odd
hardware configureations, multiple hard drives, etc., since all
encrypted "volumes" are mapped to DOS files.
OTOH, this same architecture can waste disk space, especially in cases
where SDev encrypted "volumes" occupy most or all of a DOS diskette or
HD partition.  The "outer" FAT and directory in this case are almost
completely wasted.
SDev's device driver also takes about 50% more memory than SECTSR.
OTOH, Sdev's encrypted volumes are safer from accidental writing
if the device driver is not loaded, since they're mapped to read-only
DOS files.
SDev may be a little more secure then SDrv. SDev's checkword to verify
the password is encrypted, while SDrv's is in plaintext. SDev gets
this benefit because encrypted "volumes" have their own encrypted boot
record.  Someone has pointed out that the plaintext checkword could be
used to assist a pre-computed dictionary attack on marginally weak
Another advantage of SDev is that it was developed outside the USA and
so is available world-wide without violating ITAR.  SDrv has "leaked"
overseas to some individuals, but is not, AFIK, being openly
distributed there.
SDev "volumes" always start out encrypted and empty. You can't take an
existing partition or diskette and encrypt it (or decrypt it).  This
may be less convenient especially if disk space is scarce.

@_subject: MIT has released PGP 2.6 
I received your announcement of PGP 2.6 on Cypherpunks.  I have one
question I hope you will address.  You said,
    In order to fully protect RSADSI's intellectual property rights in
    public-key technology, PGP 2.6 is designed so that the messages it
    creates after September 1, 1994 will be unreadable by earlier
    versions of PGP that infringe patents licensed exclusively to
    Public Key Partners by MIT and Stanford University.  ...
    Because earlier versions of PGP (including MIT's Beta test PGP 2.5
    release) will not be able to read messages created by PGP 2.6
    after September 1, 1994, MIT strongly urges all PGP users to
    upgrade to the new format.
    The intent of the format change is to discourage continued use of
    earlier infringing software in the U.S., and to give people
    adequate time to upgrade.  As part of the release process, MIT
    commissioned an independent legal review of the intellectual
    property issues surrounding earlier releases of PGP and PGP
    keyservers.  This review determined that use of PGP 2.3 within the
    United States infringes a patent licensed by MIT to RSADSI, and
    that keyservers that primarily accept 2.3 keys are mostly likely
    contributing to this infringement.  ...
The problem is that messages generated by PGP 2.6 after 9/1/94 will
also be unreadable by PGP 2.4 (VIACRYPT PGP) which is completely
legal for both private and commercial use in the USA because it has
a license issued by RSADSI.  This is the -only- version of PGP which
may be legally used commercially.
They will also be unreadable to users of PGP 2.3 who reside overseas.
These persons are not violating RSA's patents because those patents
are not valid overseas.
I will not willingly give up my current ability to exchange encrypted
e-mail with commercial entities, or with users outside the USA/Canada.
What is the legal status of PGP 2.5, which does not have this delayed
action crippling "feature"?  Is the 2.5 license valid?  If so, why
would anyone in their right mind switch from 2.5 to 2.6?
Why is RSADSI and MIT acting against the interests of their own
licensee, ViaCrypt?  (And shooting themselves in the foot by reducing
their ViaCrypt royalty income)?
Enquiring minds want to know!

@_subject: PRZ Endorses PGP 2.6 
I was a little surprised to receive the following as a response
from a "vacation" program apparently prepared by PRZ to answer his
e-mail during a temporary absence:
    In case you haven't heard, MIT is soon releasing PGP version 2.6,
    available from an FTP site at MIT, for US noncommercial users only.
    It is a nice version of PGP, with all the strength and integrity of
    PGP 2.3a, with some bug fixes and improvements.
    -Philip Zimmermann
I suppose this means he thinks (knows?) that problems inter-operating
with overseas & commercial (Viacrypt) users will be worked out.
