Hi. I'm trying to get information on NAMBLA and found your post on a random search. I'm having trouble locating NAMBLA. The website seems to have been stopped. I've written to someone else (a former secretary of the group) but thought I'd try you as well.
Some close friends suggested it as a good place to join, chat and make friends with similar interests.
Any help would be appreciated.
