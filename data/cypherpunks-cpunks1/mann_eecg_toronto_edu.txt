Some of the social, legal, ethical, moral, and policy issues you
raise are very relevant.  In thinking about our recent Special
Issue on cyborglaw, here is a comparison of architecture-based
recording (surveillance) and person-based recording (sousveillance).
You might find this comparison interesting and useful for your
We'd also welcome thoughts from the whole group on this dichotomy:

Eventually, we will probably end up with a combination of
ubiq/pervcomp (surcomp/souscomp) and wearcomp (sousveillant-computing).
There will eventually be some kind of equilibrium ("equivellance")
between surveilance and sousveillance.  We will wear or carry some but
not all of the technology.  Obviously we don't wear big batteries to
run head-mounted lights, so there are some elements like shelter,
lighting, electrical wiring, and plumbing (except for diapers which
are wearable restrooms) that are best-served by the architecture.
But new emerging technologies of miniaturization will shift the
equiveillance (sur/sous equilibrium) a little more from architecture
of buildings to human-scale architecure.  I believe that the
"heavy currents" like the 600 Amp 3phase service that comes into
our building will stay in the architecture, whereas the
"light currents" (informatic electrical signals) will move more and
more onto and into the body.  Thus the shift in equiveillance will
be primarily informatic, encompassing also personal information
like lifelong video capture "cyborglog" personal diaries.
