this image of silke stoddard's knitting is burned into my mind and tatooed on my heart. she never looks like a senator from krypton on the red carpet. soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?). time for a new spring look...
i love her style. i love that she's an expert knitter and yet chooses to create very simple pieces; have a happy st. patrick's day. and i love it (thanks, coco). i am craving some sunshine.
i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
may the light always find you on a dreary day.
really really happy.
like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. 3. i think that packages stacked all over the house are a nice decorative touch (and they remind me how good people are to donate to project 31) happy things! there's a tiny restaurant

simple is always prettiest to me. my happy plans for this evening include knitting and watching two favorite movies: far and away followed by tristan and isolde.
i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
and totally not what you are supposed to be eating
