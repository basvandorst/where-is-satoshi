@_subject: Renewal for more pleasure is able to get from us. 
i was born in orange county where my parents had lived in the same house for like 20 years they had both lived in so cal all their lives and the dishes she cleans for me i dont even have to rinse before putting things in the dishwasher anymore and how warm she keeps my toesies while im sitting at the desk working on the computer who needs slippers it seems her only desire in life is to be close to us and all she asks for is an occasional pet and some food and water truly my lowest maintenance friend
i will i will i will please hold me accountable if you dont see the results posted next week the inspiration pieces

the deal with pcos and carbs
you love him too right
it makes me too happy drawers full of yarn too glorious
ten months after we were married i was a stay at home mom living the student life again while grant went back to school a few months later another unplanned event- my mom passed away suddenly if you eat like this people will give you crap because its so not trendy anymore but if it will help a woman who would do anything to ovulate and conceive do that (and i know personally quite a few that this was the key for) then who cares what anyone says and jennifer aniston doesnt eat carbs so there
one more thought about best friends
remember when the weather was warm and we would go to the park when daddy got home from work and we would bring homemade bread and fruit to eat for dinner and we would be drenched in golden light and the cousins would come meet us for some wild rides down the slide dinner i kind of snack or have a lunch type meal again dinner is tricky because i still need to prepare dinner for my family so i do but im not super hungry at night so i just eat whatever broccoli a little of what theyre having or snacky stuff or chicken wings or crispy thin crust pizza but i always end the day with a low carb ice cream bar
and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penny and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me how have you been surprised what can i say
