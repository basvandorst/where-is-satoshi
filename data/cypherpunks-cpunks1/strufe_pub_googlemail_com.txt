Future pervasive communication systems aim at supporting social and
collaborative communications: the evolving topologies are expected to
resemble the actual social networks of the communicating users and
information on their characteristics can be a powerful aid for any
network operation. New emerging technologies that use information on
the social characteristics of their participants raise entirely new
privacy concerns and require new reflections on security problems such
as trust establishment, cooperation enforcement or key management.
The aim of this workshop is to encompass research advances in all areas
of security, trust and privacy in pervasive communication systems,
integrating the social structure of the network as well.
Topics of Interest
- new aspects of trust
- privacy concerns
- availability and resilience
- community based secure communication
- data confidentiality, data integrity
- anonymity, pseudonymity
- key management
- secure bootstrapping
- security issues in forwarding, routing
- security aspects regarding cooperation
- new reputation systems
- new attack paradigms
- new requirements for software security
- malware
