Very true.
Too bad that PGP is going commercial. Even worse the fact that sources
won't be available. If PGP will become a commercial product and the
public domain version will be unsupported or ``left behind'' in respect
of the commectial version, then I believe that some hackers will
start hacking the public domain version (probably infringing PGP's
copyright as well), a new version, newly-featured version of PGP
(let's call it NPGP) will start being used and then the commercial
version of PGP will become suspect, poorly trusted and unpopular in the
Internet community.

I'd say STOP to all this discussing about t-shirts.
Isn't this mailing list supposed to be related to privacy and crypto topics?

@_subject: your mail 
Some anonymous user sent me a message which is divided in three parts.
I am sorry but I did not receive the first one. Can this anon guy
please send me the first part again?
Thank you.

The paper can be found in the proceedings of Eurocrypt '91,
D.W. Davies (Ed.), Springer-Verlag.   The author is Hideki IMAI,
I found the above paper very interesting, and I am actually going
to code it up.  Eventually, I would be highly interested in giving
a glance at your code.  Is your code available?

*or*
just get it from ftp.dsi.unimi.it!
Use the ftp INDEX command upon being connected.
Most of US's crypto software, in fact, has already been exported to
Europe and is *freely* available at ftp.dsi.unimi.it
