[Subject: Is crypt(1) a prohibited export?]
Is crypt(1) a prohibited export from the US? I thought it was. The
reason I ask is that it has come to my attention that HP ships that
overseas too, with HP-UX versions 9 and 10...
The man page is a bit dated:
Clearly written before CBW became popular.

crypt(3) is a library routine implementing a hash function. Crypt(1) is
a general purpose cryptography program implementing an algorithm similar
to an enigma rotor machine. My question stands.

[Subject: Re: PGP's "only for your eyes"]
The manual points out that you shouldn't rely on it. Its main purpose is
simply to prevent accidentally or automatically leaving the plaintext
lying around, not to actually securely guarantee that behaviour. After
all, you could always cut-and-paste the text, or (since you have the PGP
source) alter PGP to ignore the flag.
The real problem is not what it does, but what people *think* it might
I take that back. When I check the manual, it doesn't say that it is
insecure. It really ought to. At least one of the books about PGP does
though, I know I've read it somewhere other than email.

[Subject: Re: Req. for soundbites]
It was written (in English) by bob bruen :
   The four letter words that are considered indecent are an anachronism
   from the days when the French/Normans ruled England, (~1066-1300's).
   A quick look at the words and their acceptable counterparts will make
   clear the issue. The four letter word are all of English derivation and
   the socially acceptable ones are of French (sometimes Latin) derivation.
   Even the term "four-letter" is a derogatory term for the English language
   in general, because the French considered English second rate because the
   words tended to be short, unlike French. Anyone who supports the suppression    of these words is merely enforcing the old French repression of the English    and the English language from over 500 years ago. Why think for yourself    when tradition can do it for you?
    eg:
      to piss  - to urinate
      to shit  - to deficate
      to fuck  - to copulate
      cunt     - vagina So, what is the French-derived word for Motherfucker?
And, being nice and long, why isn't it acceptable?

[Cc: cypherpunks at toad.com]
I understand perfectly what the issue is. Rich wrote an important
informational message about "MS CAPI export issue" - which raises
questions about how exactly MicroSloth got away with exporting CAPI. I
for one dearly want to hear the answer. Instead he gets a JimBell rant
about conspiracies or something (I didn't read it to the end).
He CAN'T just killfile the subject. It's HIS subject, and he wants to
read the answer. The thread is relevent. When the noise level exceeds
the threshold, even in threads which you want to read or indeed
initiated, something is fundamentally wrong. I'd unsubscribe myself,
except I can't.
ObCrypto: I think the govmint goofed, letting this out. Perhaps someone
should (anonymousely) alert the DoJ to start a grand jury to indict Bill
Gates. Someone overseas should ASAP interface PGP to it and publish it.

             <3134C779.7C84 at adspp.com> Utter rubbish. You can look at the source code and easily convince
yourself that there is no backdoor. I have personally done this for the
key generation bit, and I know others who have done it for the
on-the-fly encryption. Also, 2.6ui (old version) was based on 2.3 and
interoperated fine -- it had no back doors.
What 2.6 *did* have was a built-in incompatibility with old versions, in
an attempt to make people upgrade to a version which got Phil out of
some patent-raleted hot water.

I've deleted the actual command to do the remailing, since it is
homegrown. Back at this end, I recognise the incoming mail and throw it
away. So I never get to see it, but there is a steady stream of

The "roll" command, by the way, is a perl script I picked up off the

Well, actually, it depends on whether the bytes are treated as signed or
