The IETF "Voluntary Access Control" working group could probably use a few
more people who are interested in the type of access control enabled by
reputation servers, as opposed to the type of access control imposed by
censorship servers.  Subscribe to the mailing list via

Of course you do (assuming the stupid transitive definition of a
pornopage). Start at your home page
    --> follow link to "National Instruments" in second paragraph
    --> follow link to "Reference" a few lines form the bottom of the page
    --> "WWW Virtual Library" near the top of the page
    --> "WWW Virtual Library" right at the top of page
    --> "Other virtual libraries" near the bottom of the (rather long) page
    --> "Yahoo - A Guide to WWW"
    --> "Entertainment"
    --> "Magazines"
    --> "Sex"
    --> you figure out the rest
