of the graduated tax with a national sales tax is the removal of much of
the current rationale for FinCEN and citizen identification (i.e., SSN).
Certainly, it should no longer be required for establishing a non-credit
financial institution account, purchasing a money order/cashier's check or
wiring money.  In fact, you shouldn't need SSN for employment, except that
unless you supplied some number (even if psueduanon) you'd forego accruing
benefits.  The use of SSN for the ID runs the gammut in local, state and
federal programs, but is most often justified for purposes of taxation.
Now, I'm not naive enough to believe that any of these gov't agencies or
private corps are going to willing give up citizen unit IDs, but it will be
interesting to see their new rationales for the continued use of SSN (or
its replacement) for ID.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems to me that if I were an alien
civilization and wanted to send out a beacon, in as wide an angle as
possible, across the vast reaches of space and overcome as much of the path
losses as possible using the least energy I certainly wouldn't use a narrow
band signal. Quite the contrary, I'd want to spread a low bandwidth
information signal across the widest practical spectrum. Its much easier to
increase process gain (the ratio of the baseband information signal to the
final carrier bandwidth) than transmit power.
While a narrow band signal from Arecibo's powerful transmitter/antenna
combination can be detected at a distance of about 300 light years. It
subtends a very small angle greatly reducing the likelyhood of contact.
Switching to a spread spectrum approach could allow broadening the antenna
pattern, and thereby its chances of detection, significantly without
reducing its effective range. Notice how 63 dB (or over 2,000,000 fold
effective increase in transmit power) of process gain enables handheld GPS
receivers to pull in signals from satellites, sent using only a few watts
of transmit power, without much of an antenna.
If all this seems to make sense, then why are the SETI people apparently
seaching the skies with lots of narrow band receivers? They don't seem to
be employing any broadband correlator techniques, so spread signals will
probably be missed.

@_subject: radio net 
I investigated this application several years back and see two practical
approaches: one adapt a commercial SSB or Ham transciever to use frequency
hopping spread spectrum, or two build a pirate spread spectrum satellite
ground station.
Until recently most SSB gear didn't have the RF characteristics to use FH.
Now there are a number of inexpensive sets which use direct frequency
synthesis (as opposed to the older, and much slower, phase-locked loop
approach) and can be driven at hundreds or even thousands of hops per
second. FH helps solve two problems: first it provides privacy, second it
can mitigate or eliminate fading (which is highly time-frequency
correlated). Also, the higher the hop rate, the higher the process gain,
jam resistance and the lower the probablity of intecept (all other things
being equal).
It think it was Phil Karn (Qualcomm) who once mused that it would be rather
straightforward to masquarade a high process gain SS signal on a commercial
satellite transponder. To it's owners the SS signal would be almost
invisible, making itself known as only a very slight depression in the
transponder's gain. Effectively, this could offer an inexpensive covert
channel for tunneling packets and thwarting traffic analysis.
After the Captain Midnight episode I discussed this possibility with a very
technically knowledgeable staffer at the FCC and was assured that discovery
of such signals were beyond (at that time) the ability of commercial and
national technical (e.g., Lacrosse) means.
There's much more, but this should give you the general idea.

Because commercial satellite gear is almost always asembled from several
vendors to form a station, and because it can be assembled in many ways and
is invariably done so by professionals, there are no U.S. satellite
equipment regulations for such gear.
Surplus gear is pleantiful for those who know where to look. The hardest
part is building the SS mod/demod and that's pretty straight forward for
any competent RF engineer.
If low bandwidth links can suffice, the very large spread codes (such as
those used by GPS) can be used to place the covert channel well below the
noise floor.  GPS uses a whopping 63dB of code gain.  This in turn means a
small earth station with low power (cheap) transmitter can suffice.  I
would be surprised if you could use a backyard or even DirectTV antenna.

That's exactly it. Deuterium-Flourine (and I think Deuterium-Iodine) have a prominent emission line which matches up nicely with CO2.  In practice, the DeF/DeI are hypergolically combined in the combustion chamber (that is they combust immediately upon contact) producing an impressive power output.  Somewhere inside or just outside the nozzle CO2 is injected and turbulently mixed.  Two parallel mirrors perpendicular to the exhaust lase the pumped up C02 and other (tracking) mirrors direct it to the target.  Unlike most other high power lasers these babies are CW, not pulsed, and capable of generating multi-megawatt beams.

Deuterium combines with the excited fluorine to give excited deuterium fluoride (DF) molecules, while the helium stabilizes the reaction and controls the temperature. The laser's resonator mirrors are wrapped around the excited exhaust gas and optical energy is extracted. The cavity is actively cooled and can be run until the fuel supply is exhausted.

Legislating Cookies
By John Roemer
November 28, 2000
In the absence of legislation written specifically to regulate Net
privacy, should a 14-year-old wiretapping law be applied to Internet
privacy issues?
Two federal class actions filed last week raise this question,
claiming that online ad companies violate federal laws by tracking
consumers' browsing habits without their permission. Filed in Denver
against Excite at Home subsidiary MatchLogic and in Redmond, Wash.,
against the online advertiser Avenue A, the suits complain that the
two companies planted cookies on consumers' hard drives to track their
Web habits for commercial purposes, thereby violating the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, passed by Congress to deter wiretapping,
and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
As concerns about Internet privacy grow, legal experts believe that
the outcome of these two suits could shape the development of future
Net privacy practices. If the judges decide that existing wiretapping
laws forbid the practice of tracking consumer information via cookies,
Web advertisers will face legal liability for cookie use unless they
are scrupulous about notifying consumers of the practice. Conversely,
if the courts decide that the existing wiretapping laws don't forbid
the use of cookies without adequate notification, it could be open
season for advertisers to harvest and sell information about site
visitors, at least until Congress drafts new legislation to govern
consumers' privacy rights in cyberspace.
Although both companies declined to comment on the suits, attorneys at
the powerhouse class-action firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach
who joined both suits are trying to convince the judges that the
existing law regulating wiretapping can also be applied to the Web.
They argue that the online advertisers accessed consumers' information
without their knowledge, using a method similar to one a wiretapper
would use to intercept a phone conversation.
But Denver attorney Philip Gordon, an expert in wiretapping statutes
and a fellow of the nonprofit Privacy Foundation, points out that
Congress intended ECPA to protect the content of communications, such
as the words spoken in a phone conversation, not transactional data,
such as the number dialed and the length and cost of the call. In Web
usage, that transactional information is of value to advertisers.
Gordon noted that the cases might turn on whether the defendants can
show that users reviewed and understood the privacy policies that were
posted on the sites. Another hurdle for the plantiffs is whether all
of Net users' experiences are sufficiently similar for the cases to
qualify as a class action.
The outcome, whichever direction it takes, is likely to clarify an
area of Internet law that remains murky, at least for the time being.
"Internet law is simply not developed in this area," Gordon says.
"Ideally, the courts should grapple with these issues and decide if
federal statutes can be applied to the novel technologies presented."

President Bush rests comfortably after surgery to implant pacemaker in brain
Posted on Friday, July 13 @ 09:34:24 EDT
By Tom McNichol, Salon
WASHINGTON -- In the second White House health scare in little more than a week, doctors Wednesday night implanted a sophisticated pacemaker in President Bush's brain. The device, known as an implantable cranial defibrillator, or ICD, continuously monitors and records the president's brain waves. When Mr. Bush's brain activity becomes dangerously slow for a chief executive, the device delivers a mild electric shock, jolting the president back to a relatively active mental state. "I feel good," the president told reporters several hours after the operation. Bush then twitched noticeably. "I mean, I feel well," he said.
Doctors say the implant is performing flawlessly, although they're trying to limit the number of shocks Bush receives to fewer than 100 a day. The surgery came barely a week after Vice President Dick Cheney was fitted with a device to regulate his irregular heartbeat.
The White House portrayed last night's medical procedure as an "insurance policy" against further problems for the president. At a news conference at George Washington University Hospital, where the
operation was performed, doctors downplayed the seriousness of Bush's condition. The periodic electric jolts from the implant, physicians say, will have minimal effect on the president.
"His hair is not going to stand on end," said chief surgeon Dr. Alan J.Thayer. "Well, maybe a little."
The president, looking tired but fit after his operation, said that the device will help him function better as a world leader.
"The American people need to know that their president is equipped to handle a trouble spot like Slovenia," Mr. Bush said. "Serbia, I mean Serbia," he added, his head jerking violently.
Bush has an extensive medical history of moderately impaired thinking and reasoning, dating back to the 1970s. Doctors have long noted that the president's thoughts easily become confused, and that his public pronouncements often deteriorate into a tangle of mispronunciations, faulty logic and bad grammar. Although Bush's condition wasn't serious enough to prevent him from running for president, or from winning the state of Florida, doctors say his condition has deteriorated significantly in recent months. The president's brain wave activity dipped dangerously low during his recent trip to Europe, and stopped altogether at one point during a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader was unaware of any change in Mr. Bush's condition, officials say.
Yesterday, the president's doctors subjected him to a battery of mental tests to assess his risk of developing a potentially fatal "zero brain wave" pattern. Once the risk was confirmed, surgeons decided to implant the electronic device, which acts both as a pacemaker and a defibrillator. The pacemaker component is programmed to speed up the president's thinking when it becomes abnormally slow. The defibrillator can shock his brain back to a normal state if Bush's thoughts become "too fast," although doctors say that the chances of that happening are remote.
The device that doctors sutured to the base of the president's cerebellum is known as a Medtronic Gem IV DR model. (There were some problems with an earlier model, which had to be recalled by the
manufacturer.) Such devices, once the stuff of science fiction, have become an increasingly common tool in modern neurology. Hundreds of prominent Americans have been fitted with so-called mental pacemakers in recent years, including actor Adam Sandler, TV personality Mary Hart, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, singer Britney Spears, Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif., former vice president Dan Quayle, and the entire board of directors of the now-defunct Pets.com. Some of those who wear a mental pacemaker expressed hope that the president's condition would raise public awareness about their circumstance.
"This may turn out to be a blessing in the skies for all of us," said talk show host Maury Povich, who was fitted with one of the first Medtronic devices four years ago. Mr. Povich trembled violently from head to toe before adding, "I mean disguise, disguise, for God's sake, turn it off."
Bush has been advised to avoid deep thoughts for a few days to give the device a chance to settle in place. Doctors say the president so far has cooperated fully with the recommendation. Bush has also been told to alternate holding his cell phone against his right and left ear so the implant receives equal doses of radiation from each side. And the president will have to run at full speed whenever passing through White House metal Several congressional leaders privately expressed concern about the president's medical procedure, coming barely a week after Cheney was fitted with a device to regulate his irregular heartbeat.
But Bush dismissed the worries, stating that the Bush-Cheney team is "more fit than ever" to lead the country.
"You'll find no healthier duo than Dick Cheney and I," Bush said. The president hesitated, as if waiting for a signal, and when none came, broke into a toothy grin.

When looking at antitrust it seems prudent to consider, to whatever degree possible, whether regulatory intervention achieves the intended goals or whether it merely substitutes one set of problems for another.  Market dominance/penetration has been a major issue in antitrust.  Reduction of consumer choice through stifling of innovation should be included with predatory pricing and other consumer impacts in consideration of antitrust.
At a workshop presentation last spring I suggested a non-regulatory way to include reduction in choice effects.  Under the proposed changes Congress would set market size and penetration limits for all markets (based on SIC or its newer offspring) exceeding some minimum size threshold (e.g., 0.1% GNP) and enabling competitors to sue in federal court for removal of trademarks and copyrights of the monopolist related to the industry in question.  Since trademarks and copyrights are privileges and not rights they can, theoretically, be rescinded.
Under this new regimen companies would be inclined to self-police rather than risk legal proceedings from their competitors.  By setting legal market share limits and placing the initiative in the hands of competitors rather than the DOJ it is hoped to remove much of the political involvement in antitrust.

I think many or most on this list, not to mention within the computer industry, might disagree with you.
This was discussed at the workshop.  Its the reason I mention the SICs.  My hope is that by extending these Standard Industry Codes to somewhat smaller gradations, none of which would be allowed to fall below some GNP threshold, that MS' classification (almost all of whose business currently falls in the Software Publishing category) might be subdivided into, for example, OS and Office Software Application Suites.
No.  Though my readings in antitrust have led me to the conclusion that there are few industries in which greater than 50% of market share are required for sufficient economies of scale.  One that comes to mind is commercial aircraft.
It might if I get to have choices which would otherwise be foreclosed once one company reaches a "friction free" point in that industry.

Indict Saddam
By Michael Rubin. Mr. Rubin, a visiting scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, recently returned from nine months as a Carnegie Council fellow and visiting professor in northern Iraq's universities.
Tuesday's U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq once again raise the question of why much of the international community continues to treat Saddam Hussein with kid gloves.
When Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began his campaign of ethnic cleansing in 1992, after all, Europe did not respond by expanding trade with Serbia. Quite the opposite, it ostracized Milosevic and, in 1993, succeeded in pressing the United Nations to appoint a commission of experts to investigate his crimes. The judicial process was slow, but paid dividends. It took six years to indict Milosevic, and another two years to bring him to the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
Lucrative Contracts
Contrast that experience with the approach to Saddam, a perpetrator of much worse human-rights abuses than Milosevic. Sadly, lucrative Iraqi business contracts appear to have precluded any European effort to indict Saddam for war crimes.
Russia, for example, has earned more than $1 billion from Saddam under the oil-for-food programs, and has promises of several billion dollars more in future contracts once sanctions are lifted. And in the first four years of the oil-for-food program, France won $3.5 billion in trade with Iraq.
Baghdad certainly doesn't award contracts based on quality: Of six Russian ambulances ordered for the town of Halabja, for example, five broke down irreparably within a month, complained local hospital officials. So what is Saddam getting in exchange? Maybe it's the votes of at least two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council against the creation of an international court to look into the Iraqi regime's war crimes.
While working as a visiting professor at the University of Sulaymani in Western-defended northern Iraq this past year, I had occasion to witness the growing involvement of Western executives in Iraq. Mohammed Douri, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, recently told a reporter, "Politics is about interests. Politics is not about morals. If the French and others will take a positive position in the Security Council, certainly they will get a

One can perform some interesting experiments using an evacuated "integrating" sphere.  Instead of a pinhead sized opening use something a bit larger with a quartz window.  Suspend a small high temperature refractory ball in the center of the sphere (tungsten) and line the interior of the sphere with PV "cells" (e.g., overlapping of standard rectangular cells) overcoated to efficiently reflect frequencies above or below the band gap.  Sunlight from a concentrator is focused on the sphere bringing it to incandescence.
The combination of the ball and the reflective overcoat functions to "remix" the solar energy limiting the "leakage" of photons not in the bandpass from exiting the system. The vacuum prevents convective coupling of the ball and the cells although cooling the exterior of the sphere with a water jacket may be advised.  System conversion efficiency can exceed 35%.

Full Article:
UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif., Nov. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- In a major first for the entertainment and telecommunications industries, Universal Studios Home Video (USHV) and Hop-On (OTC: HPON) have partnered to launch the first-of-its-kind, disposable cell phone in connection with the DVD/home video release of "Jurassic Park III" on December 11. The limited edition introductory phone, a specially-designed Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone, employs the latest hands-free, voice-activated communications technology, and will be available only as an exclusive FREE offer via inserts in thousands of "Jurassic Park III" DVDs and videocassettes for a limited time.
Cutting-Edge Telecommunications Technology
The exclusive Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phones will offer 60 minutes of prepaid calling time without the requirement of a cellular service contract or monthly fee. Compact and lightweight in design as well as fully recyclable, the cell phones require only two buttons: CALL and END. Using mistake-proof, automated voice-recognition dialing, the cell phones include a hands-free earbud/microphone to provide safe and convenient communication. Once activated, the phones are supported by 24-hour operator assistance and last up to six months.
The limited edition Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone will also feature a branded "Jurassic Park" faceplate to enhance collectability. Hop-On plans to release a regular disposable cell phone in national retail outlets for $30 after the introductory promotion with "Jurassic Park III." The Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone combines the latest cutting edge communications product with one of the year's biggest theatrical box-office successes in time to capitalize on heightened consumer awareness during the holiday shopping season surrounding the home video/DVD release.
The cell phone offer will be communicated via on-pack stickers on all DVD and VHS copies of "Jurassic Park III" as well as through in-store merchandisers. "Because a cell phone played such a crucial role in "Jurassic Park III," we were looking to find a unique telecommunications partner to help celebrate the film's release on DVD," said Ken Graffeo, senior vice president of marketing, Universal Studios Home Video. "Our partnership with Hop-On is ideal and we are thrilled to be bringing the next wave of cell phone technology to consumers."
"The Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone is designed to give consumers easy access to help if they need it -- anytime, anywhere," said Peter Michaels, chairman and CEO, Hop-On. "As an entrepreneurial communications company we are extremely excited to be partnering with one of the most successful and dominant global media and communications organizations. Hop-On's phones have the potential to revolutionize the communications industry and this launch is an important step toward that goal."

No need to wait at all.  There was never any serious reason to license the Chaum blinding patents upon which eCash rested. They applied only to the client and their use was or could be made invisible to the mint. Software patents, including Chaum's, are not enforceable in a number of western nations (e.g., Australia, South Africa and New Zealand). Therefore, the development and release of client software with user selectable blinding, with appropriate UI warnings regarding possible patent issues depending upon client jurisdiction, from these locales should not run afoul of international patent laws.

If one assumes that delivery failures between remailers are the exception rather than the rule then remailers could publish delivery failure notifications in message pools (e.g., Usenet alt.anon.messages) encrypted with a sender provided key and subject line.  The user's remailer client could then scan the group for the subject line to detect problems.
One important aspect of preserving the efficacy of a bearer token based value system is fraud prevention.  If the tokens are to be exchangeable for outside value (e.g., dollars) then there must be effective way to prevent the purchaser from defrauding the mint.  There has been considerable debate on the "e-gold Discussion"  list on the risks of accepting other payment forms for e-gold (which generally cannot be repudiated).  One e-gold market maker, particularly stung by cheats, made some recommendations                                                     'May Scale' of monetary Hardness        Item

Observe that say stock brokerages definitely do not accept credit cards or paypal to fund an account.

I disagree.  We should all be ashamed.

I don't run a mixmaster because:
  - its not been easy to get running
  - it uses SMTP ports which are filtered on my AT&T cable system.  The remailer reference lists need to include port number references so users on these "restricted" ISPs can participate.  Since the traffic is encrypted it might make sense for operators to choose port numbers used by P2P applications which currently encrypt traffic (I believe Morpheus does).
  - it didn't run under Windows (until the other day)
There needs to be an automated way to anonymously and securely determine if your messages have gotten stuck at a particular remailer.
I won't run an exit remailer because of the obvious risks  Does Ian G's Hotmail exit code still work?  Is this practical?

You must mean non-commercial users since substantial number, probably a majority of commercial servers run this crud.
Are there good free one's?
But these are likely to be the most difficult to find and persist.  I think its a bad idea to hinge remailer network improvements on the participation of deep pocket parties who need convincing that this is a ideological fight they should take on and risk their resources and public image upon.
I'll look into this and report.
These restrictive ISP policies are almost always aimed at web hosting and mail and rarely against other ports or services (e.g., P2P) which are major driving forces for consumers purchasing broadband connections.  As for the judgement of whether something is wise I would love the remailer network to work as even as well as Gnutella or Freenet.
I see no need to follow only one path which might become a dead end.
I think architectures which lower the bar should be equally be explored.  Alternatives are the life blood of any business strategy.  Commitment to a single avenue increases risks.
If clients generate message digests for each link in the daisy chain then the Web interface to the remailers could enable automated checking whether a message was received and successfully processed by each remailer.  Provacy could be maintained by having the remailer response include all MDs for some client selected/fixed window.
Well certainly the few brave operators we currently have.

An alternative method, discussed privately with another CP list member, would have the sender could provide a response-inbound message appropriate for each remailer in the chain and imbed this with the outbound message (maybe in the header). This imbedded message would be a concentrically wrapped and encrypted message just like the sender's outbound message, but constructed so it would backward chain to the originator.  Might not even be to the same address as the sender's to obfuscate the linkage. Similar to reply block.
My preference is using a Web server interface in the remailer to allow the originator's client to automatically check the progress of their message.

A lesson not lost of The Founders, many who paid with their lives and their fortunes even if they did keep their sacred honor.

You need to decide before you demonstrate: how important this issue you're protesting is, how far you're willing to take your protests and what you may be risking in doing so.  Then make preparations accordingly.
All Western countries fear losing the support of their middle class, tax paying, citizens.

I wonder what the destructive mechanism is for this system?  Heat by radiant absorption seems an obvious but impractical method.  If it is, then as the article mentions there may be some inexpensive and practical countermeasures to such a system, such as making the exterior of the missile body into a multi-faceted mirror able to reflect both IR and radar energy (although doing the same for the nose cone might prove more difficult due to aerodynamics).

From US Pat 5,345,238, Satellite signature suppression shield
If a high energy laser (HEL) is being used to attack the shield, the laser must irradiate the cone with an energy above 10 watts per square centimeter normal for more than two minutes continuously to damage the gold coating. Occasional short term hits will do no damage except by lasers with a much higher energy than currently considered practical. Higher laser energy levels will do damage in less time, but the signature suppression levels are low enough, that closed loop tracking of the satellite is impractical at altitudes above 100 km. FIG. 6 shows the time required for vaporization of the metal film over the balloon skin as a function of the aspect angle. Direct irradiation with a 10 W/cm.sup.2 laser beam was used. The dotted line in the figure represents a 10 micron gold film over a 0.5 mm Kapton skin. The solid line represents a 10 micron aluminum film over a 0.5 mm Mylar skin.
So if the exterior of the missile had characteristics similar to the shield above it might deter direct damage from a HEL.
I haven't done the path loss calculations but suffice it to say acquiring and maintaining beam lock and delivering several Watts/cm at distances of 100 km is a daunting challenge.  Due to Raleigh scattering some pretty big aperture mirrors are needed to keep beam divergence sufficiently small (non-Gaussian optics, for example second order Bessel, could also help but complicate optical design and efficiency.)

The optics used for focusing are probably mirrors, one fully reflective and probably backed by piezo actuators to controllably distort for focus and adjust for atmospheric distortions, the other mostly reflecting (to keep the lasing process going) to "leak" the lethal beam.

@_subject: napster: civil disobedience re: copyright laws 
An interesting article, but not entirely factual. The author states that, "Historically, copyright protections were afforded to promote expressive discourse fundamental to a democratic society." I think a bit of digging shows that not to be the case.
 From The Anglo-American copyright system grew from a private sector function of the English Stationers' Guild in the 15-16th century. It mainly functioned to regulate the book trade to ensure that members of the guild enjoyed monopolies in the books they printed. Conveniently for English authorities, the guild's practices provided an infrastructure for controlling (i.e., suppressing) publication of heretical and seditious materials. The English kings and queens were quite willing to grant to the Stationers' Guild control over the publication of books in the realm in exchange for the guild's promise to refrain from printing such dangerous materials. Until its abolition, the Star Chamber was available to back up judgments emanating from the stationers' private enforcement and censorship system.
If the pre-modern copyright system promoted freedom of expression by making books more widely available, this was an incidental byproduct of the market that arose for books, not an intended purpose of the then-prevailing copyright system. Far more harmonious was the relationship between copyright and censorship in that era. Men burned at the stake for writing texts that were critical of the Crown or of established religion. The stationers' copyright regime was part of the apparatus aimed at ensuring that these texts would not be printed or otherwise be widely accessible to the public.
I think it would be much more accurate to say that copyright's "modern era," which began with the Statute of Anne is about to celebrate its 300 anniversary. However, the fact that a private, pre-modern, copyright form lasted for over a century, which was motivated by the profit of monopoly control and with the government's help censorship, is an important example in understanding how revisionist history is created and should not be ignored.

@_subject: Shooting down 'Bandit Satellites' 
A more insidious plan would put up a fleet of retro-reflector satellites. Before Telstar two Echo aluminized plastic film balloon reflectors were launched.  Over 100ft in diameter they weighed about 50 lbs apiece and remained in orbit and operational for over a year, one using compressed gas and another using a sublimation-based generator to keep the structure inflated.
An upgraded reflector using a inflated array of smaller corner cubes would have much higher effective reflectivity due to a lower dispersion of the return signal then Echo.  An array of smaller cubes also increase the life span since they can be compartmentalized after inflation reducing the effects of micrometeorite punctures.  Depending upon orbital height such sats could be effectively used to communicate over metropolitan and larger Since its passive, there are no electronics to fail and no costs for ground control.  You can use most any UHF and higher frequency because its a broadband device.  This means many of the frequencies below 11 GHZ, which are not much affected by rain scatter and atmospheric absorption and now used for terrestrial microwave, can be reused with little or no interference because the beam path is largely orthogonal to the current users.  By having so much bandwidth available very broadband communication techniques like UWB may be entirely feasible.
Due to the narrow angle of the return beam's cone, only backyard sized dishes (maybe even the smaller "dish network" jobbies) married with inexpensive alt/azimuth mounts might be required at the receiving end. However, since the satellites are moving continuously communication would be problematic (and require better sky coverage then working geosynchronous sats) without a large number of birds and/or steerable beam receiving antennas.  Then again, with enough bandwidth spreading a low data rate (10s kbps) signal might be receivable from such a bird with a simple whip in the same way as GPS.
The transmitter end requires a considerably larger dish, to put the maximum amount of energy on the sat, but not beyond that used by advanced amateurs radio buffs doing moon bounce communications.  A maser transmitter with cavity modified to form a single, non-zero-order Bessel beam could reduce dispersion by an order of magnitude over the divergence angle of beams emerging from the dish using a Gaussian profile, but this is probably too exotic for non-commercial consideration.

AND THE OSCAR FOR BEST PICTURE ON GOVERNMENT FAILURE GOES TO..."
Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" failed to win last night's Academy Award for Best Picture, but its sobering lessons about the War on Drugs make it Hollywood's most educational offering in years, explains economist Jeffrey Miron, research fellow at The Independent Institute, in an op-ed that appeared in yesterday's San Diego Union-Tribune, New Jersey Record, and the Orange County Register.
"Although 'Traffic' did not win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year, writes Miron, "it deserves the title of Most Important Picture of the Year."
"Traffic" does not address all of the drug war's unintended consequences (no film could), but what it does address, it does so brilliantly. "Traffic" Miron argues, shows how drug prohibition causes the violence often attributed to drugs, corrupts government bureaucrats, enriches criminals at expense of the rest of society, and strains relations between races and nations. "Traffic" also shows why many law-enforcement agents come to believe that the drug war cannot be won.
Given the drug war's many casualties, the cultural impact of "Traffic" may come to surpass that of two other recent movies that bust the myth of good government, William Gazecki's shocking documentary, "Waco: The Rules of Engagement" (1997) -- which led to more Congressional hearings on the Waco raid -- and Barry Levinson's prescient tragicomedy, "Wag the Dog" (1997) -- whose title has become a catch phrase for presidential slights of hand conducted with military props. If so, then perhaps the United States will begin to wean itself from its destructive addiction to the drug war.
(Note: For TV viewers who didn't recognize former White House Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey in the audience at last night's Academy Award ceremonies, McCaffrey was the one wearing egg on his face.)

Why does the United States elicit such extreme hatred in some parts of the What America is based on is not the achievement of some goal, the capture of some trophy, or the triumph of success. It's about the process of seeking something. It's about incompletion, dissatisfaction, striving, imperfection. In the late 18th century, this was a statement in itself. In the Europe of the preceding centuries, armies had gone to war, human beings had been burned at stakes, monarchs had been dethroned, and countries torn apart because imperfection wasn't enough. From the Inquisition to the Reformation, religious fanatics had demanded that the state enforce holiness, truth, and virtue. Those who resisted were exterminated. Moreover, the power and status of rulers derived from their own perfection. Kings and queens commanded artists to portray them as demi-gods. Dissenters were not merely troublemakers; they were direct threats to the perfect order of the modern state. This was a political order in which everything had to be perfectly arranged, even down to the internal thoughts of individual consciences.

In which our man in mirth declares a new kind of independence
Much of the world is confused and infuriated by America. And I contend that happiness is the source of the confusion and fury. Other countries are established upon pride, power, nationality, blood, and religion. Not America. Pursuit of happiness is what we're all about. It's front and center in our charter, an inalienable right; the Declaration of Independence says so. No talk of happiness appears in England's Magna Carta.

Interestingly enough, the United States government conducted a controlled experiment called the Nth Country Experiment to see how much effort was actually required to develop a viable fission weapon design starting from nothing. In this experiment, which ended on 10 April 1967, three newly graduated physics students were given the task of developing a detailed weapon design using only public domain information. The project reached a successful conclusion, that is, they did develop a viable design (detailed in the classified report UCRL-50248) after expending only three man-years of effort over two and a half calendar years. In the years since, much more information has entered the public domain so that the level of effort required has obviously dropped further.
This experiment established an upper limit on the required level of effort that is so low that the hope that lack of information may provide even a small degree of protection from proliferation is clearly a futile one.

November 17, 2001 -- EXCLUSIVE
The NYPD and the Secret Service have launched a major investigation into complaints that bank customers have lost thousands of dollars through unauthorized ATM withdrawals.
Since last Saturday, the NYPD has received more than a dozen complaints of unauthorized withdrawals, mostly from people who have used ATMs on the Upper East Side.
But customers who use ATMs in the Financial District and the West Side have also been hit.
Cops are expanding their probe citywide and expect to find many more cases.
Sources said most of the complaints involve Citibank customers, but people who bank with Chase and other institutions also have been victimized.
Customers have lost up to $3,000 apiece - even though their bank cards have never left their possession.
Most of the victims are people who used ATMs in grocery stores, delis and shopping malls, the sources said.
Investigators believe that the thieves have managed to hook up personal computers to the ATM and download information about customers, the sources Then they make phony bank cards and withdraw money using the customers' personal identification numbers.

In earlier ATMs, such as Citicorp manufactured models, all the I/O components were separate and the signals between them could either be captured by a Y-cable or a cable with a small hidden xmitter or by their unintended RF radiations.  Newer ATMs, I believe, integrate the keypad with the crypto processor and attempt to reduce opportunities for PIN interception.  ATM magstripe reader data, since it is available to any stripe reader on a credit authorization terminal, may not be as well protected.  Though since you need both to pull off a card spoofing scam, it would seem prudent to secure that data as well.

Hiding Past And Present Presidencies:
The Problems With Bush's Executive Order Burying Presidential Records
By JOHN DEAN
Friday, Nov. 09, 2001
On November 1, President George W. Bush signed his latest effort to
govern by secrecy - Executive Order 13233. For good reason this Order
has a lot of historians, journalists, and Congresspersons (both
Republican and Democratic) upset.
The Order ends 27 years of Congressional and judicial efforts to make
Presidential papers and records publicly available. In issuing the
Order, the President has pushed his lawmaking powers beyond their
The Secret Presidency
As President watchers know, we have a President who likes secrecy. He
has hired only tested leak-proof and loyal staffers, effectively
sealing the Bush White House. He has had his records as the Governor
of Texas hidden, shipping them off to his father's Presidential
library, where they are inaccessible. He has stiffed the Congressional
requests for information about how he developed his energy policy -
refusing to respond.
No President can govern in a fishbowl. But not since Richard Nixon
went to work in the Oval Office has there been as concentrated an
effort to keep the real work of a President hidden, showing the public
only a scripted President, as now. While this effort was evident
before the September 11th terrorist attacks, the events of that day
have become the justification for even greater secrecy.
The mystical veil of "national security" has been cast over much of
the Bush administration. There were the secret arrests of
terror-related suspects (currently over 1000 publicly unknown
people). There was the expansion of the wiretap granting powers of a
secret federal court hidden within the Department of Justice. There
was, and continues to be, an apparent policy of precluding news
organizations and congressional leaders from access to anything other
than managed and generic news about the war in Afghanistan.
With all these moves, President Bush is brushing aside one historical
tradition of openness after another. It is in this context that the
President's latest action must be viewed.
The Executive Order suggests that President Bush not only does not
want Americans to know what he is doing, but he also does not want to
worry that historians and others will someday find out. Certainly that
is the implicit message in his new effort to preclude public access to
Presidential papers - his, and those of all Presidents since the
Reagan-Bush administration. There is, however, no justification
whatsoever for this latest effort to hide the work of past, present,
and future Presidents.
What Bush's Executive Action Means
There has been some confusion about the meaning of the President's
actions in addressing Presidential papers. He has not repealed the
existing law, as some have asserted, because he does not have that
power. But he has sought to significantly modify the law, and made its
procedures far more complex, cumbersome and restrictive. In doing so,
he has exceeded his executive powers under the Presidential Records
Act of 1978.
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer has tried, unsuccessfully,
to spin Executive Order 13233 as doing nothing more than implementing
the existing law, but in fact, the Order does much more. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, when pressed during his briefing, Mr.  Fleischer
dodged the tough questions, or said "that's a matter for the lawyers."
Fleischer contention that the Order is innocuous would not hold up
under close scrutiny, and so he avoided that scrutiny.
Attorney Scott Nelson's Testimony Against the Order
One lawyer who appreciates exactly what has been done is Washington
attorney Scott L. Nelson, who represents Public Citizen, the public
advocacy group that flushed out the Nixon papers during several
decades of litigation. Mr. Nelson knows these laws well because
Richard Nixon was his client for 15 years ironically, much of that
time fighting Public Citizen. Indeed, Scott Nelson has been involved
in the litigation that has shaped the body of law that President Bush
has ignored in issuing his Executive Order.
On November 6, Nelson appeared before a subcommittee of the House
Committee on Government Reform, chaired by Congressman Stephen Horn,
to address the new Bush Order. He explained in detail its flaws -
which I have only summarized below, by highlighting a few examples of
how the Bush Order ignores, or seeks to change, the law.
The Presidential Records Act
Under the 1978 Presidential Records Act, virtually all of a former
President's records are to be made publicly available by the Archivist
twelve years after that President leaves office. There are narrow
exceptions for papers that still must be withheld for national
security reasons.
But the 1978 statute specifically states that among the material to be
released by the Archives twelve years after a President leaves office
are his confidential and private communications with his advisers
(White House staff and Cabinet Departments). The existing law does not
provide an exception for withholding "attorney-client" or "attorney
work product" materials.
The New Executive Order: Adding Presidential Privileges to Those in
the Act
Through Executive Order 13233, President Bush has sought to
re-interpret the 1978 law. To put it briefly, the Order adds and
enumerates privileges upon which a former or incumbent President can
block release of a former President's materials.
In claiming that the Order does not contradict the Records Act, Bush
relies on a clause in the Act that states that it does not "confirm,
limit, or expand constitutionally-based privileges which may be
available to an incumbent or former President."
Bush's lawyers read this clause as bringing into play all of the
privileges the law has precluded. They cite specifically the Supreme
Court's 1977 holding in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services,
which says that a former President can exert executive privilege.
The 1978 law only recognizes the enumerated privileges set forth in
the Freedom Of Information Act. Nevertheless, Bush's Executive Order
makes clear that he reads the law as entitling a former or incumbent
President to assert a laundry list of privileges: the state secrets or
national security privilege; the communications with advisors
privilege, the attorney-client and attorney work product privileges,
and the deliberative process privilege.
Shifting the Burden, and Adding Extra Procedures
President Bush has also shifted the burden from the former President
to the person seeking the material. Under the Executive Order, the
person seeking material must show that he should be given it; it is no
longer necessary for the former President to show why material must
not be disclosed.
Bush's Executive Order also takes the Archivist of the United States
out of the role of deciding if a former President's invocation of
privilege should or should not be honored. That role is now assigned
to the incumbent President. And obviously, it is likely that
Presidents - wanting successors to honor their own invocations of
privilege - might tend to accept former President's claims.
The new Executive Order also creates an elaborate procedure for an
incumbent President to block his predecessor from releasing
documents. In addition, under Bush's order, a former President can
indefinitely block release of his material, which is not possible
under existing law.
Another added benefit for former Presidents is this: When the
incumbent President agrees with the former President about his
decision to not release records, the incumbent President (through the
Department of Justice) will defend the privilege against attack. That
saves the former President what can be significant legal expenses for
attorney's fees to contest the case in court.
A New Power for Vice Presidents
While Scott Nelson did not mention it in his testimony, the most
remarkable change the Executive Order effects is that it gives not
just a President, but also a Vice President, the power to invoke
executive privilege over his papers.
The Presidential Records Act includes Vice Presidential records. But
it does not give a former Vice President the right to invoke executive
privilege - for Congress does not have the power to do so.
Indeed, under the Constitution, the executive privilege is unique to
the President. Bush's Order is nothing less than absurd in purporting
to grant the power to invoke this privilege to the Vice President,
(and may only feed suspicion that Dick Cheney's role is more
Presidential than may be appropriate to his office).
The Effect of The New Executive Order
President Bush has not stated why he revoked the existing Executive
Order (Number 12667) addressing Presidential Records. President Reagan
issued the Order in 1989 after studying the law for almost eight years
of his presidency. Many believed Reagan's Order went beyond the
law. Yet President Clinton did not challenge or change it during his
eight years in office.
Ironically, if President Clinton - not President Bush - had been the
one who issued this new Executive Order, Republicans in Congress would
no doubt have called for his impeachment for failure to execute the
laws (that is, failure to abide by the Presidential Records Act.)
Just as Clinton's assertions of privilege in court were repeatedly
questioned - and even argued by some to be abuse of process or even
obstruction of justice - Clinton's extension of Presidential
privileges through an Executive Order would have faced heavy
criticism.  But when Bush takes the same action - especially now, with
his new popularity - the criticism is highly modulated in tone.
Why Bush Apparently Issued the New Executive Order
What appears to have provoked President Bush's action is the fact that
some 68,000 documents from the Reagan presidency were waiting at the
White House when Bush arrived, ready for release by the National
These documents passed the twelve-year deadline for public release on
January 12, 2001, but their release has been stalled by the Bush White
House until now. The documents are believed to contain records that
Papa Bush, as Reagan's Vice President, is not happy to have made
public. They also contain papers of others now working for Bush, who
might be embarrassed by their release.
Look for either Papa Bush, or someone designated by former President
Reagan, to object to any of these 68,000 documents' release pursuant
to the new Executive Order. If that happens, it will confirm my guess
as to why the Order was written at this time. The effect will be to
tie the release of those records up for years.
The most certain effect of this new Order will be litigation. The
Order will be tested in court, if the President does not withdraw it
as requested by both Republicans and Democrats in the Congress. And
should the Order not be overturned by the courts, I believe Congress
will act. In fact, Congress could act even before the courts resolve
these matters.
In short, the prospects for Bush's Executive Order 13233 remaining the
law of the land is slim to none.
A Troubling Penchant For Secrecy
More troubling than the Order's throwing a monkey wrench into the
process of releasing Presidential papers, however, is the President's
penchant for secrecy. Secrecy provokes the question of what is being
hidden and why.
If President Bush continues with his Nixon-style secrecy, I suspect
voters will give him a Nixon-style vote of no confidence come
2004. While secrecy is necessary to fight a war, it is not necessary
to run the country. I can assure you from firsthand experience that a
President acting secretly usually does not have the best interest of
Americans in mind. It is his own personal interest that is on his mind
The Bush administration would do well to remember the admonition of
former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his report on government
secrecy: "Behind closed doors, there is no guarantee that the most
basic of individual freedoms will be preserved. And as we enter the
21st Century, the great fear we have for our democracy is the
enveloping culture of government secrecy and the corresponding
distrust of government that follows."

A good recent example is Warren Buffett calling for an FDIC-style government insurance against terrorism.  In the sweet name of self-interest he proposes that the government increase existing insurance moral hazards by forcing all citizens to underwrite those who have chosen to live or work in higher risk areas.
I'M in the insurance business -- an expensive place to be in the past couple of months. It was made costly for Berkshire Hathaway, the company I run, because I did something very dumb: allowed Berkshire to provide insurance coverage for a huge catastrophe loss without its getting a premium for doing so. The risk we unthinkingly assumed was a loss from Given the degree of my error, I was lucky: We estimate our Sept. 11 loss at Berkshire to have been ``only'' about $2.3 billion. That's more, by far, than we've ever lost from a single catastrophe, but the toll could have been far larger. Indeed, had a nuclear device been available to Osama bin Laden, the loss could have bankrupted most of the insurance industry.
A potential loss of almost infinite magnitude can be assumed only by an entity of almost-infinite resources. That entity doesn't exist in the private sector. Only the U.S. government fits the bill.
Washington has accepted this proposition to a point. Congress is now agonizingly trying to create some sort of industry-government coalition that would insure losses from terrorism.
Some proposals limit the government's liability but leave the risk for the industry open-ended. These proposals won't work: If unlimited liability is left with insurers, they will necessarily refuse to renew policies they see potentially leading them to bankruptcy.
Equally bad, all the proposals now being considered will engender pricing based upon risk exposure: If a business is located in a high-risk spot, it will be asked to pay a staggering price for insurance. Risk-based pricing is normally equitable and desirable. In this case, though, it would have anti-social consequences.
For example, the terrorism risk per dollar of insured value may be 10 or more times for iconic or critical properties in New York City what it is for properties in less-populated areas. But great cities are central to our society. We don't want them to wither under the burden of hugely disadvantageous insurance costs. Their citizens almost certainly bear above-normal physical risks in the terrorist war being waged upon us; we shouldn't impose crippling economic costs on them as well.
We should adopt the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as a model for where we want to head in the insurance industry. The rationale for the FDIC, formed 68 years ago, was clear-cut: The United States sorely needed to eliminate bank runs and the financial panics they caused. Before the FDIC, the risk from bank failures resided with depositors, who had no way to shed it.
Neither they nor their banks could lay that risk off on private insurers for two reasons. First, the dollar amounts involved were simply too large; second, losses were correlated, in the sense that the failure of a few banks frequently caused a chain reaction, toppling good banks with bad, leaving a mountain of economic damage. Fortunately, these punishing disruptions to our economy were ended by the advent of FDIC insurance.
Now, millions of business owners, individuals, landlords and lenders bear the economic risk of terrorist attacks. Insurers won't assume the risk -- we were previously dumb, but we've learned. It isn't right, though, that these risk-laden millions should have to shoulder this burden themselves.
If we were to adopt an FDIC model for handling terrorism, the insurance industry would not be permitted to earn a dime from the coverage. Instead, a premium tax, payable to the U.S. Treasury, would be levied on all insurance. This would have the equitable effect of spreading the terrorism-related cost to the country in general, just as we spread defense Were such a proposal enacted, it should sharply limit private lawsuits seeking to place blame on some party involved -- an airline, say. We should want the Treasury to make payments to victims solely to compensate them for loss of property, life or direct earnings, without worrying about fault. The law also should cover war losses.
Some people will argue that an FDIC model for insurance would be a socialistic intrusion into the private sector, yet that institution is today generally regarded as having been enormously beneficial. Once, the problem was bank runs and economic panics; we found an innovative solution. Today, the problem is terrorism and its capricious effects on insurance costs; we need a solution of comparable efficacy.

While I agree that all non-oil energy has, until recently, been more expensive its been a self-fulfilling prophesy.  If you don't make the investments or provide the incentives to innovation then progress is slow or stopped.  Breakthroughs in efficiency and economics are finally being made but their delayed arrival can be laid directly on the doorstep of Congress and past administration inattention.
-Wind power is finally competitive with on-grid fossil fuel plants (i.e. $0.04 - $0.05/KWh).
-Improvements in fuel cell efficiency and fuel choice  should make them competitive within a decade for transportation, on-grid and off-grid applications.
-Solar, while still not yet competitive with fossil fuel on-grid is steadily improving.  (Off-grid its already competitive.)  Recent, non-public developments, should enable substantial commercial breakthroughs As Tim and others have pointed out oil only looks cheap if all the costs are not exposed at the pump.  The most cost-effective measures to energy reform are conservation but since consumers and business have been shielded from directly/visibly bearing much of the true costs for petroleum-based power production the market signals were absent and conservation was too often ignored.

Princeton University has for a while been host to a number of computerized studies of random number generators. The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) is one. Another of them is the Global Consciousness Project (GCP), whose data is available on the web at  .
The GCP has a network of 40 random number generators (called eggs) around the world, creating numbers at the rate of 200 per second each. During events of global import, the project has noticed statistically significant variations from complete randomness in the numbers generated. The most intense global event measured by this system was the recent World Trade Center attack. It was not just a reported event. For the first time in history, a globally connected population watched on TV as 6000 people were killed in real time. This produced a correspondingly intense activity in the GCP network.
The site contains detailed statistical analysis of the data (as well as the raw data itself), and is worth a look.
Here is a quote from the narrative that accompanies it:
"When we ask why the disaster in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania should appear to be responsible for a strong signal in our world-wide network of instruments designed to generate random noise, there is no obvious answer. When we look carefully and discover that the eggs might reflect our shock and dismay even before our minds and hearts express it, we confront a still deeper mystery.
This network, which we designed as a metaphoric EEG for the planet, responded as if it were measuring brain waves on a planetary scale. We do not know if there is such a thing as a global consciousness, but if there is, it was moved by the events of September 11, 2001. We do not know how, but it appears that the coherence and intensity of our common reaction created a sustained pulse of order in the random flow of numbers from our instruments. These patterns where there should be none look like reflections of our concentrated focus, as the riveting events drew us from our individual concerns and melded us into an extraordinary coherence. Maybe we became, briefly, a global consciousness."

"Rethinking the design of the Internet:
The end to end arguments vs. the brave new world"
Marjory S. Blumenthal Computer Science & Telecommunications Board, NRC

A version of this paper to appear in the ACM Transactions on Internet
A version also to appear in Communications Policy in Transition: The
Internet and Beyond,
edited by Benjamin Compaine and Shane Greenstein, MIT Press, Sept. 2001
This paper looks at the Internet and the changing set of requirements
for the Internet that are emerging as it becomes more commercial, more
oriented towards the consumer, and used for a wider set of purposes. We
discuss a set of principles that have guided the design of the Internet,
called the end to end arguments, and we conclude that there is a risk
that the range of new requirements now emerging could have the
consequence of compromising the Internet's original design principles.
Were this to happen, the Internet might lose some of its key features,
in particular its ability to support new and unanticipated applications.
We link this possible outcome to a number of trends: the rise of new
stakeholders in the Internet, in particular Internet Service Providers;
new government interests; the changing motivations of the growing user
base; and the tension between the demand for trustworthy overall
operation and the inability to trust the behavior of individual users.
The end to end arguments are a set of design principles that
characterize (among other things) how the Internet has been designed.
These principles were first articulated in the early 1980s, and they
have served as an architectural model in countless design debates for
almost 20 years.
The end to end arguments concern how application requirements should be
met in a system. When a general purpose system (for example, a network
or an operating system) is built, and specific applications are then
built using this system (for example, e-mail or the World Wide Web over
the Internet), there is a question of how these specific applications
and their required supporting services should be designed. The end to
end arguments suggest that specific application-level functions usually
cannot, and preferably should not, be built into the lower levels of the
system-the core of the network. The reason why was stated as follows in
the original paper:
"The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented
only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the
endpoints of the communications system. Therefore, providing that
questioned function as a feature of the communications systems itself is
not possible."
In the original paper, the primary example of this end to end reasoning
about application functions is the assurance of accurate and reliable
transfer of information across the network. Even if any one lower level
subsystem, such as a network, tries hard to ensure reliability, data can
be lost or corrupted after it leaves that subsystem. The ultimate check
of correct execution has to be at the application level, at the
endpoints of the transfer. There are many examples of this observation
in practice.
Even if parts of an application-level function can potentially be
implemented in the core of the network, the end to end arguments state
that one should resist this approach if possible. There are a number of
advantages of moving application-specific functions up out of the core
of the network and providing only general-purpose system services there.
o The complexity of the core network is reduced, which reduces costs and
facilitates future upgrades to the network.
o Generality in the network increases the chances that a new application
can be added without having to change the core of the network.
o Applications do not have to depend on the successful implementation
and operation of application-specific services in the network, which may
increase their reliability.
Of course, the end to end arguments are not offered as an absolute.
There are functions that can only be implemented in the core of the
network, and issues of efficiency and performance may motivate
core-located features. Features that enhance popular applications can be
added to the core of the network in such a way that they do not prevent
other applications from functioning. But the bias toward movement of
function "up" from the core and "out" to the edge node has served very
well as a central Internet design principle.
As a consequence of the end to end arguments, the Internet has evolved
to have certain characteristics. The functions implemented "in" the
Internet-by the routers that forward packets-have remained rather simple
and general. The bulk of the functions that implement specific
applications, such as e-mail, the World Wide Web, multi-player games,
and so on, have been implemented in software on the computers attached
to the "edge" of the Net. The edge-orientation for applications and
comparative simplicity within the Internet together have facilitated the
creation of new applications, and they are part of the context for
innovation on the Internet.
Moving away from end to end
For its first 20 years, much of the Internet's design has been shaped by
the end to end arguments. To a large extent, the core of the network
provides a very general data transfer service, which is used by all the
different applications running over it. The individual applications have
been designed in different ways, but mostly in ways that are sensitive
to the advantages of the end to end design approach. However, over the
last few years, a number of new requirements have emerged for the
Internet and its applications. To certain stakeholders, these various
new requirements might best be met through the addition of new mechanism
in the core of the network. This perspective has, in turn, raised
concerns among those who wish to preserve the benefits of the original
Internet design.

The rise of third-party involvement: An increasingly visible issue is the demand by third
parties to interpose themselves between communicating end-points, irrespective of the desires of
the ends. Third parties may include officials of organizations (e.g., corporate network or ISP
administrators implementing organizational policies or other oversight) or officials of
governments, whose interests may range from taxation to law enforcement and public safety.
When end-points want to communicate, but some third party demands to interpose itself into the
path without their agreement, the end to end arguments do not provide an obvious framework to
reason about this situation. We must abandon the end to end arguments, reject the demand of a
third party because it does not "fit" our technical design principles, or find another design
approach that preserves the power of the end to end arguments as much as Continued at:

BEING WATCHED
A Cautionary Tale for a New Age of Surveillance
By JEFFREY ROSEN
October 7, 2001
I had gone to Britain to answer a question that seems far more
pertinent today than it did early last month: why would a free and
flourishing Western democracy wire itself up with so many
closed-circuit television cameras that it resembles the set of ''The
Real World'' or ''The Truman Show''? The answer, I discovered, was
fear of terrorism. In 1993 and 1994, two terrorist bombs planted by
the I.R.A. exploded in London's financial district, a historic and
densely packed square mile known as the City of London. In response to
widespread public anxiety about terrorism, the government decided to
install a ''ring of steel'' -- a network of closed-circuit television
cameras mounted on the eight official entry gates that control access
to the City.
Anxiety about terrorism didn't go away, and the cameras in Britain
continued to multiply. In 1994, a 2-year-old boy named Jamie Bulger
was kidnapped and murdered by two 10-year-old schoolboys, and
surveillance cameras captured a grainy shot of the killers leading
their victim out of a shopping center. Bulger's assailants couldn't,
in fact, be identified on camera -- they were caught because they
talked to their friends -- but the video footage, replayed over and
over again on television, shook the country to its core. Riding a wave
of enthusiasm for closed-circuit television, or CCTV, created by the
attacks, John Major's Conservative government decided to devote more
than three-quarters of its crime-prevention budget to encourage local
authorities to install CCTV. The promise of cameras as a magic bullet
against crime and terrorism inspired one of Major's most successful
campaign slogans: ''If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing
to fear.''
The ideal of America has from the beginning been an insistence that
your opportunities shouldn't be limited by your background or your
database; that no doors should be permanently closed to anyone who has
the wrong smart card. If the 21st century proves to be a time when
this ideal is abandoned -- a time of surveillance cameras and creepy
biometric face scanning in Times Square -- then Osama bin Laden will
have inflicted an even more terrible blow than we now imagine.

"This book is a strikingly new exploration of the fundamentals of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and of Newton's theory of gravitation. Starting with an analysis of causality in the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, the author discovers a series of heretofore unknown or overlooked electromagnetic interdependencies and equations. One of the most notable new results is the discovery that Maxwell's equations do not depict cause and effect relations between electromagnetic phenomena: causal dependencies in electromagnetic phenomena are found to be described by solutions of Maxwell's equations in the form of retarded electric and magnetic field integrals. A consequence of this discovery is that, contrary to the generally accepted view, time-variable electric and magnetic fields cannot cause each other and that both fields are simultaneously created by their true causative sources -- time-dependent electric charges and currents. Another similarly important discovery is that Lenz's law of electromagnetic induction is a manifestation of the previously ignored electric force produced by the time-dependent electric currents. These discoveries lead to important new methods of calculations of various electromagnetic effects in time- depended electromagnetic systems. The new methods are demonstrated by a variety of illustrative examples. Continuing his analysis of causal electromagnetic relations, the author finds that these relations are closely associated with the law of momentum conservation, and that with the help of the law of momentum conservation one can analyze causal..."

Last week, at the urging of the White House, the major television and cable
networks agreed not to run raw footage of Al Qaeda statements as they are
broadcast by the Al Jazeera network from Qatar, which appears to be Mr. bin
Laden's preferred conduit for communicating with the world. But because of
the privatization and deregulation of the international satellite business
in recent years, control of the nation's television signals is by no means
limited to the coterie of United States companies that the White House
turned to last week. In fact, the great majority of homes in the United
States have the option of receiving Al Jazeera directly using a satellite
dish antenna not much bigger than a pizza pan. For about four years, the
EchoStar Dish Network operation has been carrying Al Jazeera, in Arabic, as
a part of a premium tier of international channels. If any terrorists are in
the country waiting for televised word from Mr. bin Laden - with or without
hidden messages - last week's steps by the White House did next to nothing
to thwart them.

[Editorial] Since Sept. 11, the government has been eager to limit the

staff argues that "Americans are being asked to give up their rights to

examples of recent government efforts to control what the public sees, such
as President Bush's attempt to cut back the number of lawmakers who would
receive intelligence briefings, to eight of 535 members, and the
disappearance of information from some government Web sites. USAToday
suggests that these moves violate the very spirit of freedom that America is
fighting for. "They risk obliterating the checks on government decisions
that come when lawmakers and the general public know what the administration
is doing...If Americans are to continue supporting the war, it will be
crucial for them to know their enemy and know of their government's

In a way one could portray their situations as dismal but not dire, sort of along the on-screen comments of Arthur to the prostitute is dinning with "... so you might say you're having a relatively good time?"
In the short term economic inequalities and human rights abuses may be exacerbated (e.g., the fate of rural mainland Chinese).  The long-term effects of globalization are as yet unknown.
Agreed, but wealth is only one measure of human happiness and the jury is still out on whether the vast majority of those indirectly affected by globalization will find it has been in their best interests.

If it ever does come about and is not something centrally controlled and monitored a 'la Stephenson's Diamond Age, it could usher in an age of individual sovereignty the likes of which the world as not known since its transition from hunter gatherer to agriculture.  It might also spell the end of economy.

The knife ban won't work against anyone with even a smidgen of metal detector knowledge.  Anyone can purchase a razor sharp ceramic knife like this one  Without millimeter wave body scanners enforcing this one will be difficult.  Even advanced scanners may not detect objects secreted between butt cheeks or on the inside of thighs (especially if legs are fat or held together closely.)
Airline personnel will allow law enforcement agents, with proper forms, which are easily obtained, to board a flight with their firearms.  Available fake badges, laminators and photo quality printers on home PCs allow anyone with the interest, law LE demeanor and general appearance to pose as a Fed.  My wife raised concerns to her management that the gate people responsible for determining if a passenger claiming to be a LE agent was in fact an agent had no training to determine the authenticity of their credential. (Her supervisors listened, smiled and did nothing.) An FBI agent explained to her what she should look for in examining a bona fide FBI ID, but there are too many agencies accorded this privilege to make any simple training possible.  A centralized data base, with authentication capability by gate agents, of LE personnel allowed to carry firearms aboard U.S. domestic routes is needed.
Crew IDs
Both uniforms and IDs have been forged in the past and in at least one case used for a hijacking.  Authentication can and should be improved.
The people entrusted with  maintaining a safe air travel environment are minimum or low wage people with little training.  Israel airline and security personnel are much better paid and well trained (days or weeks vs. hours in the U.S.)  Isn't our safety worth more than minimum wage?

@_subject: Frank Sudia's proposal: Let's revive encryption key escrow  
In "Encryption and the Restoration of National Sovereignty," you said:
"No one disputes that unbreakable encryption impairs government ability to intercept suspect communications and issue warrants for stored data. The citizens have gained "unreviewable discretion" to communicate without oversight. They did not have this power before. Now they do."
"This was a direct loss of sovereignty by the Government, with a corresponding "gain" by the citizens. Conversely, the restoration of investigative capabilities cannot be considered "taking freedom and liberty from the People," since they never historically possessed this freedom."
The Fourth Amendment was adopted in direct response to the English Parliament's practice of giving colonial revenue officers complete discretion to search for smuggled goods by means of writs of assistance. The writs permitted colonial authorities, including British troops, to enter homes and offices at will and search any person or place they wanted. The early Americans rebelled against these general searches, and on the eve of the Declaration of Independence, Samuel Adams said he regarded the opposition to general searches as "the Commencement of the Controversy between Great Britain and America." It is fair to say that absolute protection from general government searches is one of this country's founding principles.
When the framers struck the original balance between personal privacy and the needs of law enforcement, remote listening devices had not yet been invented. But it is clear that had they existed, the framers would not have approved of them. By definition, electronic surveillance constitutes a general search, not a search limited to specific objects, people and places as required by the Fourth Amendment. Wiretapping, bugs, and keys to encrypted messages intrude on the most intimate aspects of human life. They hear/see everything and everyone, indiscriminately. Like vacuum cleaners, they sweep up all the details of innocent and often intimate private conversations. A tap on the phone of one person necessarily captures the conversations of anyone who happens to use that phone or call that number. Unlocking one person's encryption code subjects all who electronically communicate with that person to government surveillance. Even obtaining a court warrant does not fix this problem. Electronic eavesdropping cannot be regulated by a warrant precisely because of its dragnet quality; the object to be seized or the premises to be searched cannot be limited or even specified, because it is in the very nature of the technology to catch In 1927, during the height of federal enforcement of National Alcohol Prohibition, the Court attempted to come to grips with electronic eavesdropping for the first time. Roy Olmstead, a bootlegger convicted entirely on the basis of evidence from wiretaps, argued before the Court that a search had been conducted without a warrant and without probable cause in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. In a 5-4 opinion, the Court ruled that a physical entry (a "trespass") must be committed before the Fourth Amendment's protection could be invoked. Since the wiretaps were physically placed outside Olmstead's home, the Court reasoned, there was no government intrusion and therefore no Fourth Amendment protection. The Olmstead decision defined the law for forty years, and during that period, the government was able to engage in virtually unrestricted electronic spying.
The Olmstead case, by a narrow 5-4 margin, destroyed the original balance of the Fourth Amendment, but it was also the occasion for Justice Louis D. Brandeis' prescient dissent in which he warned that, "The progress of science in furnishing the government with means of espionage is not likely to stop with wire-tapping." Brandeis wrote that because wiretaps indiscriminately pick up every conversation within their reach, they constitute the kind of general search prohibited outright by the Fourth Amendment, and that even a warrant requirement would not give sufficient protection. Unfortunately for our privacy rights, Brandeis' dissent has never been adopted by the Court, although it did overrule its Olmstead decision in 1967 when it belatedly recognized that the Fourth Amendment applied to wiretapping and electronic spying (Katz v. U.S.). Nonetheless, Justice Brandeis' account of the framer's intentions is right on the mark:
   "The makers of our Constitution...sought to protect Americans in their
   beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They
   conferred as against the Government, the right to be let alone -- the
   most comprehensive of the rights of man and the right most valued by
   civilized men."
Cryptography can help shift the balance of the Fourth Amendment back to what the framers originally intended. And that is what the FBI is against.
The government's own records show that electronic surveillance is of marginal utility in preventing or solving serious crimes. It did not, for example, stop or lead to the apprehension of the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, or the first World Trade Center bombers. Those crimes were solved by good detective work. Serious crimes of violence, including terrorist crimes, are almost never the targets of electronic surveillance. Electronic surveillance does, however, lead to violations of the privacy rights of vast numbers of innocent Americans. According to the government's own statistics, 2.2 million conversations were intercepted in 1996, of which 1.7 million were deemed innocent by prosecutors.
Electronic surveillance is absolutely inconsistent with a free society. Free citizens must have the ability to conduct instantaneous, direct, spontaneous and private communication using whatever technology is available. Without the assurance that private communications are, indeed, private, habits based upon fear and insecurity will gradually replace habits of freedom.

THE ROOT CAUSE
Cassius said, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in the stars but in
ourselves that we are underlings." John E. Schwarz, a political scientist
at the University of Arizona, is far less certain of that:
"The notion that people have a capacity to control their own destinies is an enormously strong, almost insistent feature of our American culture. The stories of penniless immigrants who came to these shores and became successful are as legion as they are inspiring, fostering a belief that anyone can start anew in this country and succeed. Principal Joe Clark tells his students at Eastside High School in Paterson, New Jersey: 'Don't you know, no one can hold you down unless you consent to it.'
"Nonetheless, many people believe that over the past three decades a dangerous anti-ethos has arisen: the idea that the individual American is not responsible for his or her own fate. From the point of view of these observers, too many individuals have come to see themselves as victims rather than as agents, to feel sorry for themselves instead of working to pick themselves up--a mentality that government assistance programs helped to spawn and now continue to reinforce. With the expansion of government has come a feeling of entitlement and an emphasis on rights over responsibilities. The creed of personal accountability so important to the American ethos has withered, and with that has come a rise in welfare, illegitimacy, crime, and other social pathologies--the price the society has paid for the abandonment of character.
"Or has something gone wrong with the ethos itself? The premise that individuals can control and so be personally responsible for their own lives presumes that the opportunity to do so exists. Generations of
Americans have called this "the land of opportunity." But is it, still? Does opportunity remain available and adequate to the needs of the American people, sufficient to enable them to take control of their own lives? Does this ethos, which is expected to connect us and provide the moral underpinnings of a just and healthy society, reflect the reality that American families actually experience in their everyday lives? Are the problems troubling society today due to the disintegration of values and character, or to a genuine lack of opportunity that prevents individuals and families from being able to determine their own futures?"

Another case of reducing liberty with only the appearance of improvement in safety.  A bad bargain even if it worked.
Also, the breadth of the application of the Interstate Commerce Clause since its growth spurt in the '30s is staggering and very troublesome. I can't find much historical justification for it in the writings of the framers (can anyone on the list?). Its reached the point where almost any economic (and many non-economic) activities come under the ICC.  Its become the source of most of Congresss' power and they know it.  Only recently has the SC begun to issuing a more narrow interpretation (bully for them), but its still too broad and I find any expansion under it to be resisted wherever possible.
The creation of yet another, even more intrusive, federal data base which (if recent events serve as an example) can be abused by those in authority is to be avoided at all cost.
If the U.S. Consulates and INS had not fumbled the ball on admitting and tracking those legally admitted it might have raised the bar considerably on domestic terrorism from these sources.  But now a heard of zombies are roaming free among us and we may never know the true extent to which we were exposed by those inept guardians of our safety.

Hitchens , Chap. 2, "Indochina", pages 25-26. [Pub: Verso/2001
, ISBN 1-85984-631-9]
"On 12 May 1975, Cambodian gunboats detained an American merchant
vessel named the Mayaguez. In the immediate aftermath of the Khmer
Rouge seizure of power, the situation was a distraught one. The ship
had been stopped in international waters claimed by Cambodia and then
taken to the Cambodian island of Koh Tang. In spite of reports that
the crew had been released, Kissinger pressed for an immediate
face-saving and "credibility"-enhancing strike. He persuaded
President Gerald Ford, the untried and undistinguished successor to
his deposed former boss, to send in the Marines and the Air Force.
Out of a Marine force of 110, 18 were killed and 50 wounded. Some 23
Air Force men died in a crash. The United States used a 15,000-pound
bomb on the island, the most powerful non-nuclear device that it
possessed. Nobody has the figures for Cambodian deaths. The
casualties were pointless because the ship's company of the Mayaguez
were nowhere on Koh Tang, having been released some hours earlier. A
subsequent congressional inquiry found that Kissinger could have
known of this by listening to Cambodian Broadcasting* or by paying
attention to a third-party government which had been negotiating a
deal for the restitution of the crew and the ship. It was not as if
any Cambodians doubted, by that month of 1975, the willingness of the
US government to employ deadly force.
In Washington, DC, there is a famous and hallowed memorial to the
American dead of the Vietnam War. Known as the Vietnam Veterans'
Memorial, it bears a name that is slightly misleading. I was present
for the extremely affecting moment of its dedication in 1982, and
noticed that the list of nearly 60,000 names is incised in the wall
not by alphabet but by date. The first few names appear in 1954, and
the last few in 1975. The more historically minded visitors can
sometimes be heard to say that they didn't know the United States was
engaged in Vietnam as early or as late as that. Nor were the public
supposed to know. The first names are of the covert operatives sent
in by Colonel Lansdale without congressional approval to support the
French colonialism before Dien Bien Phu. The last names are of those
thrown away in the Mayaguez fiasco. It took Henry Kissinger to ensure
that a war of atrocity, which he had helped prolong, should end as
furtively and ignominiously as it had begun."

Public safety agencies urge quick rollout of wireless location services
By BOB BREWIN
(September 27, 2001)
With a Monday deadline looming, three national public safety organizations want the Federal Communications Commission to stop granting waivers and extensions to cellular communications companies that would allow them to miss the long-mandated start date for E911 wireless location services.
The agencies said the FCC should hit carriers that miss the deadline with "serious penalties" for noncompliance.
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. -- and the heavy use of cellular networks by the public and rescue workers, including jury-rigged automatic location systems in New York -- make it difficult for the FCC to grant new waivers for a system that it first envisioned in 1996, said Jim Goerke, wireless implementation director at the National Emergency Number Association in Columbus, Ohio.
The Sept. 11 attacks have helped focus attention on the importance of wireless emergency contact information, Goerke said, adding, "[The cellular carriers] have had a lot of time to get this together."
While the FCC hasn't indicated how it will act, analysts expect it to take a strong stand. The chances of continued leniency by the commission "are about equal to everyone being a winner in Las Vegas," said Alan Reiter, an analyst at Wireless Internet & Mobile Computing in Chevy Chase, Md.
The technology isn't perfect, but it does exist, said Reiter. The cellular industry has been engaged in "legal stalling," a tactic that won't work in the postattack world, he said.

Intel Bets Farm on Moore's Law
By Tom Murphy -- Electronic News, 7/26/2002
Intel Corp. will supply 3GHz Pentium 4 processors in time for the holiday season, accelerating the company's previously announced timetable by nearly a quarter.
Despite trends that show consumers increasingly hunting for value-priced systems with lower-performance processors, Intel is more determined than ever to stay on the Moore's Law growth curve of doubling process speeds every 18 to 24 months.
\Even Gordon Moore, creator of the industry-defining Moore's Law, believes the trend line for adopting faster semiconductors is showing signs of flattening. In spite of that, Intel keeps tweaking the efficiencies of its manufacturing processes, churning out higher-speed machines and introducing eye-opening technology improvements such as HyperThreading and 300mm wafer But Intel's agenda may run deeper than rapid adoption of the new chips. A 3GHz machine would give Intel a substantial lead on rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD). And with each new speed grade Intel introduces, it is able to increase the pressure on AMD by dropping the price on lower-performing parts.

I worked there and respectfully disagree.  MN never gained a foothold first and foremost because of the frequent join/leave problem.
This, in turn, was a direct result of insufficient resources to address automated publication of .mp3 header data.  The inability of the client SW to automatically create the header data and publish directories full of .mp3 files at each client meant users had to expend more much effort to make available their content than file-oriented P2P alternatives.  This hurdle, when combined with data retention problems related to other MN deficiencies, assured that little content was available for DL.  New users simply abandoned the effort when they came up empty handed.
The introducer problem could probably have been solved using Usenet postings.  The nature of Usenet meant it could scale and was fairly resistant legal and technical attacks.  Usenet might also have served for a fallback block store but neither approach was ever carefully considered, again due to resource limitations.
My experience is that the malicious client problem was not a major issue.

BIND-PE once installed will act as a fully recursive and caching multi-threaded DNS Server (default), with persistent cache capabilities (cache will be maintained between reboots), this will speed up your Internet resolving queries and make name resolutions much more reliable. BIND-PE Version 1.0 distro is aimed at home/SOHO users on WinNT4 SP6, Win2000 and WinXP workstations.
BIND-PE simplifies the task of installing and correctly configuring the DNS service using a completely custom BIND compile for WinNT Operating Systems with an automated "One-Click" setup process for Dial-up, Cable modem, and DSL networks for workstations. Post-install manual changes to configurations are compatible with the standard ISC BIND 9 configuration syntax and examples. For your convenience, a Control Panel similar to BIND 8 versions is active and included with on screen data details (instead of write to file).
All standard as well as new TLD's (.aero etc.) are included and accessible for DNS name resolutions and browsing. Alternate TLD's like  and  (almost 200 additional TLD's) websites which were not normally available in Legacy setups will now be viewable in browsers.

Japanese banking system 'about to collapse'
TOKYO: Japan's financial system is headed toward collapse and will require
a government bailout of one trillion dollars, a US think tank said.
"Japan appears poised to follow the passive route of outright default,"
resident scholar John H. Makin wrote in the monthly Economic Outlook report
put out by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research on
"The negative net worth of the Japanese banking system is somewhere above
the yen-equivalent of one trillion dollars," Makin wrote. "When the banking
system collapses... the Bank of Japan will need to inject at least one
trillion into the banks to protect depositors from losses."
He said such a procedure would need to be financed by the Japanese
government, resulting in total public debt jumping by 15 percent, and
causing a surge in liquidity that would cause Japan's currency and bonds to
'It amounts to beating harder a dead horse'"Japan's deflation and debt
crisis now constitute systemic risk to the global economy," he wrote.
The report harshly criticises Japan for failing to stop rampant deflation,
which increases the burden of paying off debts.
"Efforts by the Bank of Japan to boost economic activity and to reflate by
increasing reserves in the banking system and cutting short-term interest
rates virtually to zero amount to beating harder a dead horse," Makin wrote.
"The dead horse is the Japanese banking system, which by virtue of its
insolvency is unable to act as a financial intermediary borrowing short
from the central bank and lending to Japan's private sector."
Makin also criticised moves to postpone past next March the government's
plan to cap its guarantee on bank deposits to 10 million yen (about
R900 000), saying; "that step will only delay the outright collapse of the
banking system." - Sapa-AFP

I came up with a similar approach in the late '80s (I may have even discussed it on the list a year or so back).  I was interested in compressing image data, which has quite a bit of inter-pixel correlation.  My approach was to run a Hilbert space filling curve through the image (it looks like a tightly wound maze).  This allows one to maintain most of the pixel correlation while transforming from an array to line.  Then I analyzed the auto correlation of the runs of various lengths and attempted to create generators which could produce the required combinations/permutations and auto correlations to code for the runs.  I say attempted, because I was never able to find acceptable algorithms to satisfy my requirement.  I still believe these algorithms exist, it was just my limitations in identifying the underlying math needed.

I knew the guys behind Fractal compression, but that's not what I was trying to do.  They looked for a higher-level order I was just looking to take advantage of local correlations and the ability to identify identical runs in the output of deterministic generators who's references could be expressed very efficiently (e.g., correlation coefficient/seed value, displacement) compared with the data being compressed.  Its a highly asymmetric approach so real-time applications were not considered.
IFS eventually became practical but they came from a time when proprietary solutions were king and missed the open standards revolution which powered JPG (which while generally as good at compression was open to improvement, well studied and not chained by patents).

@_subject: Another questionable decision from SCOTUS  
In an obscure tax case decided this term, United States v. Craft,  a husband owed money to the I.R.S. and the I.R.S. put a lien on some of his property. Michigan, like a number of states, has a concept called "tenancy by the entireties," in which property can be owned by "the marriage" as a separate entity and, when it is, the husband and wife have no individual interest in it. The husband transferred the property to "the marriage," and then told the I.R.S. "Look, I don't own this stuff anymore, 'the marriage' does." The District Court found the transfer was not fraudulent and that the I.R.S. could not touch the property. The 6th Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court noted that the legitimacy of the transfer was not disputed on appeal.
The Court held that Michigan's concept of a marriage as a separate entity from its individual participants was nothing more than a legal fiction and, as a mere fiction, the I.R.S. could ignore it. O'Conner held that if the husband and wife didn't individually own the property, that meant no-one owned it, a result she found absurd.
I am gravely troubled by this reasoning. As pointed out in Alexis de Tocqueville's truly brilliant analysis of the foundations of our American government (e.g., "The government of the Union rests almost entirely on legal fictions. The Union is an ideal nation which exists, so to say, only in men's minds and whose extent and limits can only be discerned by the understanding. Everything in such a government depends on artificially contrived conventions, and it is only suited to a people long accustomed to manage its affairs, and one in which even the lowest ranks of society have an appreciation of political science."
Of all the legal fictions in American government, one of the hardest to swallow is the fiction of a Supreme Court. Under this fiction, when certain individuals express opinions on various issues under certain conditions, we are to regard these opinions as, not merely the separate individual opinions of these few separate and individual persons, but the single opinion of something called a Court, which is said to have powers and responsibilities wholly separate from the individuals of whom it is comprised. These powers and responsibilities are said to flow from something other than, and more than, the mere composite or sum of those All the sources of these powers and responsibilities -- constitutions, laws, governments, social compacts written and unwritten -- all are themselves legal fictions, wholly made-up conventions. Indeed, law itself is the supreme legal fiction.
The Justices should think long and hard before adopting a theory which disses the respect the citizenry has traditionally reposed in corporate entities and institutions that serve social purposes thought valuable. For as de Tocqueville rightly noted, that respect is essential to our republican form of government. The philosophy the Court espoused was so general that it cannot fail to encompass the Court itself -- and for that matter the Union -- in its generality. Every question the court asked of marriage can be asked of both the Union and the Court. If public land cannot be apportioned out to individual citizens, who owns it? And if judicial opinions do not represent the private opinions of individual justices -- if we get rid of this "Court" legal fiction -- can they be said to be the opinions of anyone?
These are questions well worth asking. If their answers prove not to be wholly absurd, then neither is the question Justice O'Conner asked about who owns property in a marriage. If they are wholly absurd, then so is our form of government.

I think whether the 2nd is enforceable against states and municipalities will depend upon the SC deciding to apply the 14th Amendment.  The Supreme Court has long held that the 14th Amendment does not make all of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. Only those rights the Court finds to be "fundamental" apply. To this day, several portions of the Bill of Rights, including the right to indictment by grand jury, to a jury trial in any common-law suit over $20, and to the rules of the common law in judicial review of jury fact-finding, have not been held to be fundamental and to this day are not applicable to the states.
Is the right to keep and bear arms a fundamental right? Obviously the NRA would argue that it is. But the Supreme Court would be well within precedent if it were to hold that given modern conditions, a right to keep and bear arms, like a right to a jury trial for a 20-dollar dispute, can no longer be said to be so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty as to be fundamental. If it so held, the 2nd Amendment would remain applicable to the Federal Government, but would not apply to the States, which would be free to use their militia regulatory powers to regulate guns as they see fit.

It tells you the output power, from which one may estimate input power Beam spread is one of the most significant considerations in delivering high energy to distant targets. In general, one wants a large beam size to reduce divergence.
The phenomenon of diffraction influences the propagation of Gaussian light beams. The output of a laser is generally ''pencil-like'' in nature and has a very low divergence, yet is subject to diffraction that causes it to spread. Gaussian beam theory deals with this effect.  The Rayleigh range, Z sub R, is used as a criterion for determining the spreading of a monochromatic Gaussian light beam as it propagates in free space.
In 1987 it was discovered that were ''nondiffracting'' beam types.  The zeroth-order Bessel beam is one such solution and results in a beam with a narrow central region surrounded by a series of concentric rings.  Ideally this beam type exhibits no diffraction or spreading, in practice it is possible to obtain Bessel beams of less than 1/10 the divergence of a Gaussian beam of otherwise similar properties.  Bessel beams have been the subject of intense investigastion for a broad range of optical applications.

After reviewing the list I don't deny the dangers inherent in experimenting with these items.  My objection has to do with the federal government's Over the past ten years I've made it a "hobby" to study the detailed legislative histories of several key constitutional amendments (e.g., the 14th and 16th) and Supreme Court rulings on these amendments and their interpretations of the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clauses.  I've read the works of and discussed the findings with a number of Constitutional scholars (e.g., Larry Lessig and Eugene Volokh).  In general they support my conclusions and share a serious concern for the frightening lack of respect Congress and the Supreme Court have shown the Constitution and our liberties.  If I am right substantial portions of federal law passed since the Civil War (and especially since the FDR administration) have no basis in a clear reading of the Constitution.
I have no qualms with my state regulating many of my behaviors and possessions, but find the federal involvement unlawful and unacceptable in this area.  Most of my fellow citizens accept an almost unlimited federal involvement in our daily lives.  The Founders placed many safeguards in the Constitution to prevent this, but Congress and the Courts have found illegal circumventions. Most Americans would rather not know that their liberties have been and are continuing to be drained away by the unconstitutional practices of the supposed guardians of their liberties.  They believe that the current balance struck is the best under the circumstances.  In fact, they are frightened by (or consider mentally unbalanced or unpatriotic) anyone who would raise serious objections. I am left to protect my rights the best I can, even if it means violating unlawful regulations.
If you are one of the "many" you will probably find my ranting that of a loon.  If not, a good place to start your inquiry is with the recently published book, "The Real Lincoln," by Thomas diLorenzo  Its causing quite a stir in American historical circles.

@_subject: State's medical marijuana proposition doesn't trump federal 
(fwd))
[The following is my response to a related article (unfortunately not on-line) from the Opinion section of the San Jose Mercury News by Larry N. Gerston, a professor of political science at SJSU and political analyst at NBC3, wherein the question is asked whether we should have obey laws we don't like.
Your September 11 SJMN op-ed piece, "State's medical marijuana proposition doesn't trump federal regulations," made some good points regarding the current balance of power between the states and federal government and the importance of obeying laws. And in a perfect world I'd agree, but this is not that world. Sometimes civil disobedience or even criminal action is needed to pressure legislators or the courts to doing what's right. Governmental systems have an inherent mandate to increase power and rarely give it up. When those in authority encounter impediments they will often seek a means, occasionally illegal, to achieve their ends. Our system of checks and balances (including the states) was created to thwart the most dangerous form of anarchy, anarchy from within. Whenever this system fails all our liberties are at stake. Such is the case with the apparently illegal enactment of the 14th Amendment upon which is based much of current federal authority.
At the close of the Civil War the Republican controlled Congress sought to legally "lock in" the expansion of federal authority it had gained as a result of battlefield victories with Joint Resolution No. 127 proposing a 14th Amendment. But once again the Southern States stood in their way. Although President Jackson (who succeeded Lincoln) and Congress had acknowledged the legitimacy of the these duly elected governments, in their frustration the 39th Congress voted, on December 5, 1865, to deny seats in both Houses to anyone elected from the 11 southern States. They also ejected New Jersey Senator Stockton who opposed the bill and would have cast the deciding ballot, and refused to count the denied southern representative's numbers when computing the two-thirds majority Constitutionally required for passage. Whether it requires two thirds of the full membership of both Houses to propose an Amendment to the Constitution or only two thirds of those seated or two thirds of those voting is a question which it would seem could only be determined by the Supreme Court.
Congress cared little about these "minor irregularities" in the proposal and voting process, they proceeded to submit the amendment to the States for ratification. But, surprise, things did not go well. After some legislatures first ratified and then recanted, in the end 16 of the 37 states rejected the measure. When the State of Louisiana rejected the 14th Amendment on February 6, 1867 [making the 10th State to have rejected the same or more than one-fourth of the total number of 36 States of the Union (as of that date) leaving less than three-fourths of the States to possibly ratify the same] the Amendment failed. It could not have been revived except by a new Joint Resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives in accordance with Constitutional requirement.
Congress decided that states legislatures were not free to change their minds on ratification and ignored all those who did so. On the 20th of July 1868 Secretary of State Seward issued his proclamation of ratification of the fourteenth amendment, in which, after reciting the law of 1818 requiring him to publish the ratification of an amendment to the Constitution in the newspapers. However his language in the proclamation shows very clearly that Mr Seward had his doubts about the Constitutionality of the ratification process, and he takes pains to relieve himself of any responsibility by declaring that - "Neither the act just quoted from, nor any other law, expressly or by conclusive implication, authorizes the Secretary of State to determine and decide doubtful questions as to the authenticity of the organization of State legislatures or as to the power of any State legislature to recall a previous act or resolution of ratification of any amendment proposed to the The Senate brushed aside Secretary Steward's concerns and on the next day Senator Sherman offered a Joint Resolution declaring that three fourths and more of the States had ratified the proposed Amendment, and therefore that it was a part of the Constitution. Secretary Steward was pressured into certifying the Amendment as passed. In a Message to the Senate (Senate Ex. Doc. No. 57 of the 39th Congress, 1st Session); President Andrew Johnson commented on the "Concurrent Resolution" of July 21, 1868 "In this matter nothing has happened to change the mind or solve the doubts of the Secretary, but as an executive officer, he was compelled to obey a joint resolution of Congress whatever his own opinion might be of the power of Congress to pass it, that being, as I have said above, a judicial question."
Finally, there are no records showing that the Resolution was ever submitted to the President of the United States for his approbation. According to Article V of the Constitution for the United States; the Resolution is governed by the procedures of U.S. Const., I:7:3 - "Every order, RESOLUTION, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary, (except on a question of adjournment) SHALL BE PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES; AND BEFORE THE SAME SHALL TAKE EFFECT, SHALL BE APPROVED BY HIM, or being disapproved by him, shall be re-passed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill." We can conclude from the above Message that the President would have "Vetoed" the Resolution. If the Resolution was "Vetoed" [and as there are no Records showing that either House of Congress voted to repass the Resolution over the Veto], we can conclude that the Concurrent Resolution of July 21, 1868 failed.
To all the issues the courts have been mute, however, declaring in Unpublished Opinions that all questions involving the 14th Amendment are "Political Questions" to the Courts. Its this sort of dereliction of duty by the courts that does mortally would our Constitution.
So, in response to you question whether one is free to ignore certain laws, I bow to a basic doctrine adopted by our courts:
16th American Jurisprudence 2d, Section 177, late 2d, Section 256: "No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce
