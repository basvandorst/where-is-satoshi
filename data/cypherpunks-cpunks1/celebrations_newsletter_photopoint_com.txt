DEMYSTIFYING THE DUODENUM
It took the woman a few minutes to comprehend the picture her doctor had placed in front of her. She stared at what appeared to be the opening of a pink, rather slimy tube. On the upper left-hand corner of the picture there was an oval-shaped label - a Gala apple sticker...

PHOTOPOINT'S NEW LOOK
Read about the innovations that make storing and sharing your photos easier than ever!
SHEDDING LIGHT ON NIGHT SHOTS
Few photo enthusiasts seem to venture outdoors with a camera at night because it seems like a world full of mystery and mistakes. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Modern cameras
are surprisingly capable in low-light situations that require the
use of long exposures. Once you grasp the basic principles, it's
surprisingly easy to produce successful pictures of floodlit buildings, town and cityscapes, neon signs, traffic light trails and much more.
A LESSON ON BLACK PHOTOGRAPHERS
While there is a growing awareness of works by contemporary black
photographers, there has been very little historical research or critical analysis of the images produced by 19th and early 20th century
African-Americans. In reality, African-Americans have produced photographs since the invention of the daguerreotype in 1840.

MUSHING TO NOME
This time last year, Ludington Daily News photographer Andy Klevorn was buying fleece and double-checking his camera gear, preparing to follow musher Al Hardman through central Alaska as he competed in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, the "Last Great Race on Earth." CHOOSING A NEW LENS FOR YOUR CAMERA
Though most cameras sold today include a built-in lens, models that accept interchangeable lenses are far more versatile. Such cameras are generally of the Single Lens Reflex (SLR) type, meaning you view the subject through the lens which will take the picture. COME HOME
