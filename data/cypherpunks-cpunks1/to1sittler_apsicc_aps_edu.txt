@_subject: Fear 
I just thought I should add that I agree with the last poster.  Cryptography
will be increasingly hard to learn in the future, if this kind of thing goes on.
But it will be ten or fifteen years before anyone has computers which can
crack an 128-bit version of DES.  I am cryptologically naive, but I think that people can always find privacy when they want it.  An underground
cypherpunk movement may be the only way to bring up new cryptographers.
More important is the issue of equipment.  Is a computer communications
equipment?  If so, we might have clipper chips on our motherboards.  Reading
input from the keyboard.
This is a crisis for privacy.  Can someone, preferably the people who run the cypherpunk list, set up a Privacy Advertising Fund?  I would be willing to
donate money, and hopefully many other cypherpunks would too.  We might win
that way.  Urge people to protest with full-page ads in newspapers.  With 30-
second TV spots.  With demonstrations.
I will donate, if it is formed, but I can not form it except under the most
extreme conditions.  I have no experience in advertising or management.
Be afraid.  Be very afraid.

@_subject: steganography 
In a previous message, which my VMS newsreader is too stupid to remember and
can just barely quote, an Evil Genius For A Better Tomorrow, mike at egfabt.org,
says he thinks that xor'ing 'x' over a message would help to hide the fact that
it is cyphertext.
Problem: If someone is looking for encrypted information, IDEALLY we would like
steganographically for it to be unconditionally impossible to determine that a
file is cyphertext w/o the key.  (It is of course only computationally
infeasible to guess the key, if we pick our cryptosystem right.)
The suggestions that the Evil Genius makes could easily be defeated with an hour
or two of programming using pieces of PGP's source, or ripem, or a little piece
of software designed to tell whether a file is Dolphin Encrypted or Mailsafed.
The resulting program could check hundreds of database files easily, probably
in almost exactly the time required for an open, a single disk access, and a
close on each file.
For a steganographically strong code, the cyphertext must not be recognizable
to its home program.  This means, among other things, no CRC's, no MD5's, etc,
intended to assure data integrity.  This means no delimiter-structured files.
(I think--I'm not absolutely sure on this one.)  Every field in the file must
be either fixed-length or have a number somewhere in it
(in a format indistinguishable from the rest of the cyphertext) which tells its
length.  And every field, individually, must not be recognizable as something
unusual. (For instance, no sending of large prime numbers in the clear, as they
are very unlikely to appear in a random file.)
The foregoing "field" stuff has to do with things like PGP, which have a
message cyphertext, encrypted with a session key, and a session key, encrypted
with a PKC, in the same message. (Possible several cyphertexts of the session
Oh, and it would be nice, though not essential, if a corruption in the file
made it completely, rather than partially, nonsense when decrypted.  This way
you can't have a file with no use to the recipient used as evidence against

@_subject: stegano codes. 
In reference to a message by Mike Johnson:
I was thinking of steganography as being in two stages: first, you encrypt,
(possibly with the identity transformation) then, you embed your encrypted
message in your medium of transmission.  My previous message was describing
requirements for a strong encryption algorithm, quite apart from the actual
embedding.  I stand by my statements: the purpose of steganography is to make
it difficult or impossible for an interloper to determine that enciphered data
are being transferred.  Thus, embedding a magic number in the file defeats the
purpose completely.
(As opposed to "slightly reducing security.")
I accept your correction regarding availability of software.
I think that designing a program to embed this apparently random bitstream in
an innocent-looking file is a different and much harder problem.
It is probable that I have misunderstood some part of your message, and I
apologize if this is the case.

Well, actually, it's not even a hack to find out who the subscribers are... You
simply use the EXPN command in the SMTP protocol to find out who the recipients
of a list are.  This is documented in RFC-821.
However, the cypherpunks list requires a little bit of ingenuity, or familiarity
with sendmail.
I periodically get a copy of this list, just in case.  Last I checked, there
were 409 names on the list.
Two were files, about ten or fifteen were either other lists, fidonet echos, or
local USENET newsgroups.   The rest appeared to be real people.
Most of the apparent lists listed on the cypherpunks list were not traceable
thru SMTP EXPN.  If you desire real privacy, I suggest that you get the
cypherpunks list, figure out which ones are hidden lists, and ask to subscribe
to those.
If it is desired, I can send a list of these lists to the cypherpunks list.

@_subject: xor w/prbs 
Some MORON wrote an article in Computer Shopper, about doing a one-time pad
with a PRBS... in fact, he even challenged any cryptographers to break it.
(He used a 32-bit seed for the PRBS.)
He also included a number of fallacies in the article, among them that you
change your algorithm when you think the enemy knows what it is, but you change
your keys regularly even when you don't have any basis to think so.
How *do* you break this cypher?  He is generating a lot of random numbers
between 0 and 255, and xor'ing each successive one with the next byte of plain-
text.  I know that this is a trivial cypher to break, according to PRZ at
least, but how do you do it?
This arrogant moron with pretensions to cryptographic knowledge needs to be
corrected.  (Some might say the above epithet applies to me too, to which I
reply:  I don't pretend to know crypto.  I just read cypherpunks.)
He is:

This kind of misinformation is dangerous to the public at large.
The article is on page 558 af the July, 1993 Computer Shopper.
It uses a random number generator, (now that I look, it's not a PRBS) from the
June, 1993, Computer Shopper, by the same author.
The random number generator used is like this:
It uses a global variable called RandomSeed, and each time thru the random
function, RandomSeed, a 32-bit long, is multiplied by 0x015a4e35, and
incremented; and then the new Randomseed, modulo the largest desired return
value, is returned.
(Actually, mod the largest desired value +1.)
a code fragment:
 MULTIPLIER 0x015a4e35L
 INCREMENT 1
long RandomSeed;
int GetRandomNumber(int Range)
So how do you crack this cipher without trying all the keys, guys?

once you get an acknowledgement from the remote computer, type

(or whatever your computer is called)
It should greet you or hang up.
So if it didn't hang up, type
mail from: DON'T FORGET THE ANGLE BRACKETS!
Then, type
rcpt to: if you connected to charcoal directly, or rcpt to: < at charcoal.com>
where somecomputer.com is where you are connected to.

or b) should appear in the mail from: line.  Try it.)
Then, type
and type in the From:, To: Subject:, Date:, Message-ID:, and so on fields.
Send yourself a message to find out how it should look.  Make the Message-ID
something that will not be replicated by the computer you are on.

Double any periods appearing alone on lines.
End your message with a period alone on a line.

Begin quote from gnu at toad.com on Tue, 25 May 1993 15:27:27 -0700
My favorite scheme was to encode messages in trailing spaces and/or tabs
in netnews messages.  You could also put internal tabs in place of spaces.
In fact, you could do this with news messages that flow "through" your site, (if the messages aren't protected with a crypto checksum), so that
you would not be the message's sender (and it wouldn't be addressed to anyone
either -- recipients get very good privacy).
This would be one way for a Unix "worm" program to report back to its
master...and/or receive instructions.
PS:  You could put short interesting stuff just in your message-ID's!
Not to mention the low order bits of timestamps (exactly *what* second
did it arrive, now?).
Trailing spaces, however, are likely to be changed by other sites: padded
or cut.  This might be a good idea if you used mime/PGP's radix-64 or uuencode
or something similar.

Despite all our word-of-mouth and -of-net efforts, the general public knows
little or nothing about the Clipper issue.  Perhaps it's time to let them
know what's going on... not in an article buried on the third page (?) of the
New York Times, not in an article on page 30 of Time Magazine, but in some
way which lets them know the real facts.
I suggest that we air an infomercial, or series thereof, urging the citizens
of the US to protest.  Phone calls to religious groups, special-interest
newsletters, and even mainstream newscasters would also be a help.
Most of us cypherpunks have little income.  A few, such as Winston Timothy
C. May, have enough for an infomercial or two.  But there is supposedly an
industry coalition headed by Novell to oppose Clipper.  Is there anyone here
who can successfully solicit these companies for money?
I don't know enough details to do this.  I don't know the cost of a half-hour
infomercial on a national network at 11:00 at night.  But I know it can be
I don't know which companies are involved in the coalition.  Nor do I know
how committed they are.  But I suspect we could raise enough money... and we
do have a number of experienced public speakers and broadcasters among us.
If the public knows the facts, just the known, confirmed facts, many of them
will be outraged.  The response that a single half-hour infomercial could
produce in a nation of 260 million would make the puny tens of thousands of votes on the CPSR petition look insignificant... as indeed they are.
C'mon folks... what's stopping us?
