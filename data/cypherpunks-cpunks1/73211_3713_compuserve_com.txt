Can anyone supply me with a list of remailers? I'm writing an article
for a general circulation newspaper on encryption, anonymous contact
services and privacy in the Information Age. I want to provide readers
with a list of remailing services.
Also, what is the BBS tel. number at MIT to download PGP 2.6?

Advice, please:  I plan on purchasing notebook PCs for myself and
colleagues to that are capable of running much-awaited Phil
Zimmermann's voice encryption program. I'll probably get something based
on the 486 DX2 chip. What type of sound card must these computers be
capable of accepting in order to run the encryptor?

The World Affairs Council has cancelled the Aug. 25 crypto policy
debate between PGP author Philip Zimmermann and NSA official Clinton
Brook because of low interest and rescheduled it for Oct. 27 at the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. I will post more details as they become
Although I'm disappointed for selfish reasons by the delay, the
rescheduling may work to everyone's advantage. The later date gives the
World Affairs Council more time to line up news media coverage. One
network news magazine has expressed interest in taping the event for
repackaging in some type of feature on encryption and civil liberties.
Also, National Public Radio has expressed an interest as well.
I've rearranged my schedule to attend the event and will prepare a
transcript of the debate to upload to any BBS, forum or news group that
will carry it. Stay tuned.

@_subject: stego 
I'm a newspaper reporter researching a how-to story on crypto. 1)
Besides RIPEM, PGP and ViaCrypt PGP, any suggestions for capsule
reviews of other public-key products? I'm interested only in public-key
implementations. 2) Are there stego programs out there that will weave
cipherdata into digital pictures or audio? 3) Has anyone reviewed the
AT&T secure phones & modems? Your thoughts? Please reply by e-mail as I am not a list subscriber. I also am a
big believer in encrypting all traffic, so here is my public key. I am
not looking to quote anyone -- all I need are ideas. However, if you say
something temptingly quotable, I'll email you back for permission. Short
of your grant of permission, I consider your material for background
purposes, i.e., I'm free to use it without attributing where I got it. -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Can anyone send me an update on how far the CPs are from releasing Phil

I've heard mention that Phil Zimmermann was going to demonstrate Voice
PGP at the January Cypherpunks meeting at Cygnus. Can anyone mail me a
note about this? Has the meeting already taken place? How well did the
demo perform?
