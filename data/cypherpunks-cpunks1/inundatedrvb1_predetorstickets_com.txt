i am so grateful for quiet time with the scriptures.
i am craving some sunshine.
i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow. we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. really really happy.
wooohoooo!" i was given the irish name kelly after my great grandparents' last name. and totally not what you are supposed to be eating
like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. interested? i think it would be so fun. i love the color palette and obvious softness. (i hate in quilting and knitting and sewing when the designs get all fancy just because they can). corned beef is cheap meat, a head of cabbage is less than 50 cents, and i bet you have all the ingredients for the bread in your cupboard. you should make this meal tonight!
pps- our topic of convo for the night was this article from the wall street journal.
let's give a hand to the world, for everything it can do!!
