Here in South Africa, we have had unmanned speed traps with cameras since
about the mid 1970's, I think, and the unmanned cameras at intersections
to catch folk driving through on a red light have been around since the
early 1980's.  Are such devices uncommon in other countries?

@_subject: Warning about exposing anon id 
Scott Collins says:
I believe that, according to the principle of least astonishment, replies
to anonymous IDs should, by default, not be double-blinded; and deliberate
action should have to be taken to request the double-blinding that
currently happens by default.  Perhaps the anon admins could be persuaded
to modify their systems accordingly;  They would just need to put na
instead of an in the FROM address, and educate their users. Several months ago, I tried to persuade one of the anon admins to do this,
but I was not successful, and that server has since shut down. Alan Barrett, Dept. of Electronic Eng., Univ. of Natal, Durban, South Africa

@_subject: Warning about exposing anon id 
Matt Blaze says:
For messages that are deliberately sent through remailers, I agree
that the sender should provide explicit instructions to direct the
operation of the remailer.  However, I would note that the mere act of
deliberately using a particular remailer can constitute an explicit
instruction for the remailer to perform its "standard" processing.
Messages that are inadvertantly sent through remailers by innocent folk
who simply reply to a (pseudonymous) message that they have received,
or simply write to an address that they have seen advertised, are
different.  I think that such messages should function as much like
ordinary (non-anonymous) mail as possible, consistent with the goal of
protecting the recipient's identity, to avoid surprising the innocent
sender.  Servers like the present implementation of anon.penet.fi do not
satisfy this requirement.

@_subject: PGP-MIME 
Ray  said:
Why is this a problem?  A MIME "Content-Transfer-Encoding" context is
a reversible transformation that is made to permit binary or other
non-email-friendly data to be carried in an email-friendly form.  Once
you have performed the encoding once, the result is email-friendly, so
there is usually no need to emcode it again.  Note that MIME places no
restrictions on the nesting of multipart messages; it merely requires
that the content-transfer-encoding be applied only at the innermost
levels of the nesting.
I have been trying, on and off, for about two years to persuade the PGP
folk to design a suitable MIME interface for PGP, modelled as closely
as reasonable on the ongoing PEM-MIME work.  Nobody ever seems to be
interested in that, but several folk have come up with their own ad-hoc
methods.  You could come up with your own ad-hoc method, or adopt one
of the others, or design something that is compatible with the PEM-MIME
stuff.  If anybody is interested in designing a PGP-MIME encapsulation
that is compatible (or nearly compatible) with PEM-MIME, I volunteer to

@_subject: SCHEME for FULL-SPEC RETURN PATH 
RFC 822 says nothing about the interpretation of the "local-part" of an
address.  (Actually, it says "The local-part [...] is understood to be
whatever the receiving mail protocol server allows.")  RFC 822 also says
that the "+" character is permitted to appear within an unquoted "atom" as
part of an address.  In other words, RFC 822 allows addresses of the form
user+misc at domain (with some restrictions on the form of the "user+misc"
string), but says nothing about how they should be interpreted. It is currently fashionable to treat mail to "user+misc at domain" similarly
to mail to "user at domain", with the "misc" string being somehow made
available for extra interpretation by the delivery software; but there is
no Internet standard for this. --apb (Alan Barrett)

@_subject: Random remailing script had. Help. 
Xenon refers to the random choice script I sent him, and asks:
If there are N remailers, then $ will be N-1.  (It's the value
of the last index into the array, but the array starts at zero.)
rand($ is a floating point number in the range [0,N)
(including 0, but not including N).  Hey, we're missing some int()
operations here; it should be like this: Now, $first is an integer in the range [0,N-1], which is correct for
indexing into the array of available remailers.  When it comes to choosing
$second, we do not want to choose the same value as $first; for example,
if N is 5 then we want to choose $first from the set {0,1,2,3,4}, and if
we happen to choose $first=2 then we want to choose $second from the set
{0,1,3,4}.  The two-line calculation of $second will do that. You will have to have csh parse the output of the perl script.  For
example, have the perl script print some csh-compatible "setenv" commands,
with something like
    print "setenv A$cycle $remailers[$first]\n";
    print "setenv B$cycle $remailers[$second]\n";
and have the csh script execute the perl script and parse its output
using something like this:
    eval `perl perl-script`
BTW, don't ever write csh scripts.  See Tom Christiansen's periodic FAQ
posting in comp.unix.shell. That was a bug, which you fixed.

Bit counting was discussed in great detail in comp.lang.c in October
1990.  I saved an excellent summary by Chris Torek, which I can post if
there is interest.  It includes a program to test 17 different methods
of bit counting, and a table of results from six machine/compiler
In 5 of the 6 tested environments, the fastest method for counting the
1's in a 32-bit word turned out to be some variant of a table lookup
(but not always the same variant).  In 1 of the 6 tested environments,
the fastest code was the following, which is similar to that posted here
by Eli Brandt:
 * Explanation:
 * First we add 32 1-bit fields to get 16 2-bit fields.
 * Each 2-bit field is one of 00, 01, or 10 (binary).
 * We then add all the two-bit fields to get 8 4-bit fields.
 * These are all one of 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, or 0100.
 *
 * Now we can do something different, becuase for the first
 * time the value in each k-bit field (k now being 4) is small
 * enough that adding two k-bit fields results in a value that
 * still fits in the k-bit field.  The result is four 4-bit
 * fields containing one of {0000,0001,...,0111,1000} and four
 * more 4-bit fields containing junk (sums that are uninteresting).
 * Pictorially:
 *	    n = 0aaa0bbb0ccc0ddd0eee0fff0ggg0hhh
 *	 n>>4 = 00000aaa0bbb0ccc0ddd0eee0fff0ggg
 *	  sum = 0aaaWWWWiiiiXXXXjjjjYYYYkkkkZZZZ
 * where W, X, Y, and Z are the interesting sums (each at most 1000,
 * or 8 decimal).  Masking with 0x0f0f0f0f extracts these.
 *
 * Now we can change tactics yet again, because now we have:
 *	    n = 0000WWWW0000XXXX0000YYYY0000ZZZZ
 *	 n>>8 = 000000000000WWWW0000XXXX0000YYYY
 * so	  sum = 0000WWWW000ppppp000qqqqq000rrrrr
 * where p and r are the interesting sums (and each is at most
 * 10000, or 16 decimal).  The sum `q' is junk, like i, j, and
 * k above; but it is not necessarry to discard it this time.
 * One more fold, this time by sixteen bits, gives
 *	    n = 0000WWWW000ppppp000qqqqq000rrrrr
 *	n>>16 = 00000000000000000000WWWW000ppppp
 * so	  sum = 0000WWWW000ppppp000sssss00tttttt
 * where s is at most 11000 and t is it most 100000 (32 decimal).
 *
 * Now we have t = r+p = (Z+Y)+(X+W) = ((h+g)+(f+e))+((d+c)+(b+a)),
 * or in other words, t is the number of bits set in the original
 * 32-bit longword.  So all we have to do is return the low byte
 * (or low 6 bits, but `low byte' is typically just as easy if not
 * easier).
 *
 * This technique is also applicable to 64 and 128 bit words, but
 * 256 bit or larger word sizes require at least one more masking
 * step.

It is my understanding that folk outside the USA can legally run PGP
versions from 2.0 to 2.3a, but cannot legally run Viacrypt 2.4 or the
RSAREF-based version 2.5, because they contain code that cannot be
exported from the USA.  Thus, it appears that the keyserver will not
accept any legally created keys from outside the USA.  I think that this

Let's see if I understand this correctly.  There is some deal, between
parties as yet unnamed, but presumably including PKP/RSADSI as one of
the parties.  This deal licences RSAREF for use in a new version of PGP,
and requires one particular keyserver to be crippled in such a way that
it ceases to accept keys that appear to have been created by certain
versions of PGP.  Right?  I wonder what advantage PKP/RSADSI sees in
crippling this one keyserver, since everybody can simply continue to use
non crippled keyservers.

Are we ever going to be told the details of the deals previously alluded

I grow more and more curious.
If users inside the USA take to using PGP 2.6 then users outside the
USA will, by fair means or foul, have to obtain PGP 2.6 (or at least
enough technical data to enable them to independently implement the
relevant algorithms).  Failing that, they will have to live with the
inability to read messages from PGP 2.6 users inside the USA.  Sigh.  I
wonder whether anybody is deliberately fostering a split between USA and
non-USA users of PGP.

I am reasonably satisfied with my legal copy of PGP 2.3a.  I would be

of certain important operations.  I understand that USA folk are in a
different legal position from mine, and may wish to legitimise their
PGP use by downgrading.  But I am most displeased with what I see as
attempts to force me to either downgrade (for no good legal or technical
reason) or face an inability to communicate with USA folk who have
chosen (for valid legal reasons) to downgrade.

  * Accept input "packets" with version 2 or 3.
  * Produce output "packets" with either version 2 or 3, under control
    of the new "version_byte" variable in the config file or on the
    command line.
  * Produce ASCII armour (or "armor" for USAans) with an desired version
    string, under control of the new "armor_version" variable in the
    config file or on the command line.
This stuff needs testing and documentation.  No warranty, etc.

If it works the way I hope, then

should be compatible with MIT PGP 2.6 after September.

@_subject: Malformed Signatures? 
A PGP signature is made like this (I think):
  1.  Decide what to sign.  In the case of a signature on a key, it
      includes the key and the user-ID to which the signature will
      attest, the date, and some other stuff.
  2.  Generate a digest of the message to be signed.  This uses MD5.
  3.  Encapsulate the digest in some way.  The old way used some simple
      padding, and the new way uses slightly more complex padding.
      PGP versions up to 2.2 always generated the old format, but 2.2
      could understand both formats.  PGP 2.3 could understand both
      formats, and could generate either format under control of the
      "pkcs_compat" option.  PGP 2.5 and 2.6 don't like the old format,
      and I am not sure how easy it would be to teach them to understand
      it.
  4.  RSA encrypt the encapsulated digest, using the secret key of the
      signer.  The results obviously depend on the type of encapsulation
      chosen in step 3.
  5.  Encapsulate the encrypted digest and some other stuff in a PGP
      "packet".
If you want PGP 2.5 and 2.6 to understand your signatures, you have to
use the PKCS encapsulation at step 3 above.  This means that you have to
ask people who have already signed your key using the old method to sign
it again using the new method.

The "bug" looks like a deliberate design decision to me.  Everything from

It's nowhere near undetectable.  When you ask pgp to check the signature,
pgp writes the signed message to a file (or to stdout), and that output
does not include the {header/junk/extra stuff} between the BEGIN line and
the blank line. I don't like this bug/feature, but I don't see it as a serious security
problem for users who are aware of it.  I do think it could be a problem
for users who are not aware of it, and who incorrectly assume that the
"good signature" message means that the {header/junk/extra stuff} was part
of the signed material. --apb (Alan Barrett)
