And whats to stop an untrustworthy virus from making the same claims, placing the 'trustworthy' virus on the system and deleting itself?
How are you going to define a 'trustworthy' virus with this scenario in mind?
There is no such thing as 'trustworthy' automated software.  At best, you
have software that does what its supposed to when used responsibly.  I
have yet to see responsible usage of a virus.. and doubt I ever will.

Again, you totally fail to get the point.  ORBS hampered communications
between many ISPs.  Simply moving to another one may or may not help.  And
if you happen to be running an ISP that came into conflict with ORBS, that
moving thing is not an option.
