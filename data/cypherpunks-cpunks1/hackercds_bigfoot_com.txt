$24.95 --  * Infoseek, Alta Vista, and HotBot ban web sites which break their rules (many of the 'insider' techniques most experts recommend will get you banned faster than you could imagine).
* Many search engines limit the number of pages you can submit from your domain (some only allow you to submit one page for best results), although we can show you a technique we use to get hundreds of our pages listed.
* Yahoo only lists about 1% of the web in their actual directory. To even get your page listed, you may have to use the "backdoor".
* Using a so-called search engine submission software that submits your site to 1,000 or more search engines could actually get your page deleted from the major search engines.
* 95% of Internet traffic originates at one of the 10 major search engines...If you're not listed, you might as well not even have a web site!
