Item Description:		
This patent is for a game I invented many years ago.  I still have the patent and have no idea of what to do with the game, or the time to do anything with it.  I am selling this game and the rights for an extremely low amount considering the value that it could make.  This patent is being sold for only $2,500 for 99% of the rights or if bid is to exceed $10,000 I will be selling all rights to the game.
The game is called Mazed Castle and involves game boards with mazes on them.  The object would be to get through the maze.  There are cards to draw to tell how many spaces to go and there are also cards that will send you in different directions, which could be to your benefit or your hindrance depending on the direction the card would send you. The mazes could have many paths to get through or just a few depending on what age level you wish to play.
