I think you should perhaps read a little more maboy. 2600 is not an FAQ,
although, with any "group" nowadays, there is a FAQ avaliable for newbies
etc (obviously like yourself). 2600 refers to a frequency, NOT a q and a,
actually it derived from a tone that could "steal" trunk lines. They are
not "supposedly hackers and phreakers". Aso the debatable issure of exact
translation of a hacker, IMO it is anyone that has altered ANY program. p.s. If it wasn't for hackers, you wouldn't have the technology you have.
OH what you've read on the beloved www. I'd imagine you read an article on
a webpage full of sex ad banners as well. I don't feel that I am an
"outlawed hero" but I feel I better society in various ways.
As I've already said, you have alot more reading to do.
I agree this is not a mailinglist for anything other than PGP. And how
this thread evolved so far is by negligence.

Perhaps you didn't read the 411 for the PGP-Mailing-List. I don't recall
it saying "Ask unrelated questions if your a newbie." IMO anyone
interested in "2600" groups can find 411 all over the www.
also there are alt.2600 newsgroups, as well as other places. I personally
wouldn't even mind if you kept it off the list and asked if I knew what
2600 is, but trying to "teach" ppl what you "think" 2600 is.. has no place
on this mailing list.
You don't know how to read?
I have no interest in starting a flame, you have embarrased yourself well
If I simply wrote the 2600 faq (which I didnt) it would have bettered
society, because idiots would have an idea what it is.
Well, obviously you stumbled upon a keyboard as well, prematurely perhaps.
I'm not trying to "scare you away". (you'd know if I was "trying"). I'll help you with anything I can, off-list. In the meantime, read.
Pretending you have an idea on what 2600 is not related to security.
(Although the 2600 group irnoically does).
Perhaps if you reply off-list or try stop trying to pull your head out of
toilet, I'll leave you alone.
as all newbies do.
