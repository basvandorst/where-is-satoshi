@_subject: ps -laxww for randmoness? 
Don Davis, of MIT Project Athena, did some research a number of years
back on getting good (physical) randomness out of a unix workstation.
If I recall correctly, the general idea was to look for trends and
biases, find explanations for them, and then filter them out or
normalize against them. Sources of "real" nondeterminism came from
things like variations in hard drive behavior (such as actual seek
time, which shows up indirectly in the paging system because it does
or does not cause time delays due to missed sectors...) I don't have a
reference handy, but if noone comes up with one I'll send him email
and see if he has it online.
but the underlying data does actually have randomness; you may have to
dig pretty hard for it, though.

      Has anyone tried using the microsecond counter from unix as a random
      source ?  Its obviously *not* going to be good if you want a continuous
      stream of random numbers, but if you need them just 'every now and then',
      what about it ?
   This should be in an FAQ:  Unixes have different levels of granularity
   in the microsecond counter; some systems may only have a 10 ms (that's
   10000 microsecond) resolution to their clock.  So you can't necessarily
   depend on a getting lot of bits of randomness from this method.

mailers, that has the IP address encoded into it to help make it more
"unique". *need* signed messages is because there is no real identity attached
to email. It is easy to "believe in" some identity you see on the net,
and for the most part enough of them are real that it is ok... but
I expect this to become even more of a problem than it is now without
we have a real-time messaging system called Zephyr (for more details,
look in Usenix proceedings from some time in 87 or 88, or just look at
athena-dist.mit.edu:pub/usenix/zephyr.PS.) It optionally uses kerberos
authentication, and the recipient application will display whether a
message is authenticated or unauthenticated. People tended to ignore
this, until one of the other developers wrote a program that looked at
the database of current users, picked a pair at random, picked a
message at random, and sent it to one, from the other. (It backfired
amusingly once -- it sent a message from him, to me, saying "I'm
stopping at the coffeehouse, want me to get you anything?" to which I
responded sure... and then harassed him about it for years, until he
finally *did* bring me the M&M's I wanted. :-)
(it did use privileged access to look at the user database, which is
not available remotely, but the messages themselves were
unauthenticated) but rather noone paid attention to it. The
"unauthenticated" flag was made more visible in a later release, I
believe... but I don't think anyone ever went as far as refusing
unauthenticated personal messages altogether. I could see that
happenning with email...

need a modem-style encoder for the output (running digital from

too easy to break) so maybe another $50 DSP chip... after all, you
don't need to support 30 different baud rates, just one data rate with
perhaps a low-line-quality backoff. The connectors and the box are

The anonymous and encrypted mail service at PAX has been shutdown.
The site that connects PAX has been told by someone from AARNet (the
Australian Academic Research Network) that the service is unsuitable
for AARNet, and that if it is not stopped then the feeding site will
be disconnected from the net.
There has been no communication from AARNet to me or anyone else at
PAX, but I cannot allow the feeding site to put itself at risk hence
the service is closed until further notice.
I am lead to believe that this is not so much AARNet's policy, but the
NSF Net's policy and the NSF have brought pressure to bear on AARNet,
as they believe that all mail that crosses their network must be traceable
to its origin, ipso facto no anonymous mailers. I have not been approached
by either organization personally so I cannot confoirm this.
I am extremely disappointed but c'est la vie.
It was an interesting experiment, and proof that the concept of anonymous
encrypted mail is feasible with simple tools. Hopefully someone somewhere
outside the jurisdiction of these authorities will be able to continue the
good work.

There's one mode (that I'm not going to post without asking the author
first) that uses terminal-mode... however, pgp-2.2 had a feature added
which should make it much easier to write one, namely it lets you
specify that a key gets stuffed in via a file descriptor -- so you run
pgp (using a pty, rather than a pipe), feed it the private key
password, then the file, and it spits back the text (and other info.)
I've been lazy, and haven't actually implemented it, but it's much
cleaner than terminal mode (since you're trusting emacs with your key
anyway, having it read the input isn't much of a problem, though I'd
suggest a "limit coredumpsize 0" first :-)
