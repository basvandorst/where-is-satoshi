@_subject: Try It BEFORE You Buy It! 
Free Post Launch!
There are a number important factors that increase the
chances of any net worker becoming successful. The
most important of which is the momentum and excitement
of actively sponsoring new members. How would you like
to know that you have an existing downline and team in
place to continue to help you develop a network BEFORE
you ever sign up or invest a penny? With our Post
Launch program you can!
A Post Launch is similar to a Pre Launch with two main
differences. A Post Launch places a large group of
excited individuals into an established Marketing
program instead of a Marketing plan that may only be
testing the waters (80% of new MLM's go defunct in the
first year of business).
Secondly, our program uses a new TEAM concept to help
you to build a network.
There is absolutely no risk to get involved and no
cost to join Post Launch. For more information go to:

You have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain!
