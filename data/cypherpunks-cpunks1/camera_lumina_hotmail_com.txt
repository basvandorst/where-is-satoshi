"Some of these problems can be avoided by using very short pulses.
Again you get into dwell, the short pulses -must- be made up for by
increasing the PRR and this defeats the who purpose of the short pulses
since you need more of them (we're talking an integration effect here
so it doesn't take much to understand why duty cycle isn't as important
as you make it out to be"
IR is not particularly better than visible for most wavelengths, and fog is the real killer (as opposed to rain or even snow). But I know the LIDAR folks found that there ARE some nicer wavelength windows within the IR band.
As for pulsed lasers, here's where my knowledge of military applications fails me (I used to work in civilian ultrafast/femtosecond optics.) As for pulsing such a laser, I can't quite imagine WHY this would be attempted for damage reasons (reconaissance is a different sotry). If the pulsing is in the millisecond regime or faster, I would imagine this is only to allow for population re-inversion of the laser material (ie, to keep it lasing at higher peak power). But I assume the military's laser research in the wavelengths of interest are well beyond the need for this.
Of course, there's the easy possibility that the military does use fast pulses for the purpose of knocking out certain sensor materials via 2nd order/nonlinear processes. As we found out back in 92 or so (from some declassification), the military's optical research in Adaptive optics was in some ways 30 years ahead of the civilian world. Who the heck knows what they're doing with laser pulses.

"Prior to that, the encrypted email I've sent in the past year or so has almost always failed, because of version incompatibilities,"
While in Telecom I was auditing optical transport gear, and we adopted the practice of encrypting all of our audit reports to vendors. Of course, the chance of there being an eavesdropper (uh...other than NSA, that is) was a plank energy above zero, but it gave the vendors the imporession we really cared a lot about their intellectual property (if we determined a problem with their equipment, and if that info ever leaked, it could have a major impact on them).
That the mesages were decrypted I know for sure, and it was easy for the customers: we would verbally tell them the password for unpacking the encrypted file, and they merely typed it in a it extracted itself.
I think the encryption tool was installed directly into the file manager (or whatever it's called now), so it was easy to do.

"Durden's question was whether a snooper on an IPSEC VPN can

The answer is no.

The protocol of the encapsulated IP packet, it's true source
behind FW1, it's true destination behind FW2, and the true
destination port are all hidden."
Yes, this was indeed the gist of my question. I was aware that there are actually hard and soft switches that are aware all the way up to the application layer, apparently (I also know that some softswiches have actually been deployed in RBOC/Baby Bell territory.)
But from your previous email, you indicated that the secure IPSEC tunnel is created by taking the packets, encrypting S/A, D/A, payload and protocol fields (ie, pretty much everything) and then dumping them into the payload of another packet, and setting the Protocol field of the parent-packet to "IPSEC". All that is now visible are the firewall addresses.
That's a lot, methinks! In other words, there's practically a bright red flag sticking up saying "I'm encrypted! Look over here!"...it's child's play (well, if you consider making an ASIC child's play!) to then look at the S/A and D/a to see if they are interesting. If they belong to the IP spaces of two large companies, for instance, then look elsewhere (though I hear rumors that the NSAs of the world are branching out into industrial eavesdropping for their parent companies, ehr, for their parent countries).
If a secure VPN tunnel forms between al-Jazeera's firewall and, say, some ISP near Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn (heavy Arab community), then all sorts of spyglasses could pop up.
Thus, I suspect a lot can be gleaned (and is) from communiques without actually de-encrypting...the philosohpy probably is, "why violate civil rights unless we really, really have to? Extract as much as we can without actually de-encrypting, and if the probably of something being "interesting" is high enough, then we'll send it downstairs to be opened" (and even then, determining how hard it is to open the communique might also be of interest...is it legal to open somebody else's email but not read it?)

The subject line says it all, if one remembers Variola's clever dare.
As far as I'm concerned, this big brother bullshit should work two ways: any tyrrany should expect that any public actions will make it onto the net somewhere. Of course, one day they'll probably begin a set of countermoves, but think of it like a chess match.
So I'm still playing with the idea of a publically-accessible document that outlines the strategies, technologies, aims and requirements for somehow uploading images and data to public repositorioes. (DAMN I'm typing like shit...must be that Chimay beer I was drinking.) The most obvious target app is large public demonstrations where video/film is likely to be confiscated.
Anyone interested? And what does it mean (if anything) to do this within the context of the Cypherpunk list?
And if there's interest, how do we proceed? As an engineer (well, until very recently!), a "drill-down" approach seems good: Start with an outline (I can take a stab at that), and then after the outline is agreed upon, send out the sections for various individuals to work. After the first draft of the document is finished, then the whole thing is somehow re-worked by all Of course, I would think it's not necessary for everyone to agree on every section or every word...different sections can contain contradicotory information...I see no real problem with that, except if PR is a consideration (in the end, this should be basically a cookbook...the users can decide upon which recipes thery want to use). Oh, and open issues are perfectly fine, and if well-identified can be a strength to a document.
Of course, when I look at this email later I may regret that I sent it out before coming down from the Belgian high. I'm hoping, however, that this will be because I started a ball rolling that SHOULD be rolling, and that I would have not set to rolling had it not been for the good ole' Chimay So now to click the send button and YAH!

@_subject: eJazeera? 
Well, the rason d'etre of 'eJazeera' as I see it is primarily for publically-taken photos and videos to be quickly "gypsied" away from their port of origination (ie, the camera that took them), so that they can eventually make it into a public place on ye old 'Net. The enabling technology as I see it here is802.11b, Wi-Fi. A typical scenario is the case of public demonstrations where the local "authorities" are called in, and where they get, shall we say, a little overzealous. In many such cases (here, New York City, Here, USA, and there--China, etc...), such authorities will attempt to confiscate devices that could have captured the events or captured the perpetrators (and their badge numbers, if applicable) in photo or video.
The ultimate aim of eJazeera is to make even the thought of "capturing" such video non-existent, due to the commonplace practices outlined in an eJazeera-type document (or eventually tribal knowledge). Short of that, it is of course in itself desirable for such events to get onto the public The methods can be various, but the easiest one was (I think) described by Tim May. Bob and Alice are pre-known to each other. Bob holds a camera, Alice has a Wi-Fi enabled laptop operational in her knapsack. After Bob takes the photos/video, he transfers the images to ALice, who walks off and moves the data to a secure and public site.
Other methods seek to eliminate the need for various levels of pre-knowledge between Bob and Alice, and to also stave off the "round up" scenario where a large group is examined and cleansed of all electronica, before data can make it onto the public net. (Less likely in US now, but easily possible ALso to be addressed in the document are (possibly) suggested technologies, down to the actual gadgets and manufacturers, and recommended spacial resolutions vs distances in order to record, say, badge numbers and facial features. Also, powering requirements won't hurt, as well as suggested methods for mitigating power issues.
(Hey--this might be way beyond what's needed or desirable, butI still think like an engineer).
In a reasonably just world, such images might be used in he short run to prosecute those that overstepped their legal bounds. Inthe long run, the commonplace practice of uploading such images should act as a deterrent to such overzealousness.
As it turns out, however, those POWs being transported were photographed in such a way as to not need something like eJazeera (unless the scope as I imagine it is broadened...is it worthwhile to consider the robust creation of image links etc... on the 'Net?).

"Indeed, I've heard the same. One could argue that for someone to believe in something (religion) so intensely as to shun all moral explanation against this hypothesis and to persist in those beliefs without any proof is akin to Well, I'm sure this is not an issue that Cypherpunks is going to want to spend a ton of time on, but let's be clear here. There's "belief", and then there's "faith". With belief,the believer refuses to acknowledge and accpet facts that disagree with their (narrow) worldview. I can't help but put the "Creationists" in this category. (Even a cursory look at their "science" makes it clear that there's TONS of information they ignored or explain away with absurd notions.)
Faith is a different matter. With faith, the faithful see the "facts" (as they are commonly understood) and still find a way to believe in something unseen. Belief contradicts reason, faith operates in parallel. I would argue that great scientists operated with a decent amount of the latter, and Galileo is a good example. At the time, the geocentric theory was still able to predict most celestial events better than a heliocentric one. But Galileo had a deeper intuitive sense that something was "wrong" with that geocentric theory, and its clumsy and mind-boggling complexity.
Likewise, every now and then one encounters religious people who recognize the "unreasonabilty" of what they believe. (Indeed, it's not easy to believe in a God that allows, for instance, the Holocaust to occur). I find these people very different from the "believer" category, and would place folks like Michelangelo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, Kierkegaard, Galileo, St John of the Cross (a Spanish mystic tortured by the inquisition) and many others in this category.
As for being akin to Schizophrenia, I'd point out that Schizophrenia is not a "mental" disorder per se, but a genetically triggered even that causes a measurable, physical degradation in the brain (a Schizophrenic's brain can be identified in autopsies).

Well, the basic idea is to co-encrypt some "fake" data that looks like the real data, so that when they find it (using the key to the fake data of course) they'll figure you gave them the real key, because they won't know that there ever was a fake key leading to fake data. (And I suppose there's no reason not to allow for mutliple batches of fake data that get encrypted along with the real data.)
And depending on the situation, the key-holder will decide whether to give them a key that destroys the real data, or that doesn't (and hides it).
In some situations, the fake data could be something completely innocuous and unrelated to what "they" were looking for, or in other cases it could look like what they were looking for albeit with doctored information.

Yeah, I was wondering when someone was going to comment on this. Methinks the whole Pointdexter bit, particularly in this context, a little fishy...a trial balloon perhaps? "How much are you little frightened people willing to give up in order to let us strong/smart leaders protect you?"
A lot could be said here, and has been I'm sure. As I continue to do my "homework", its becomming increasingly clear to me that things like public key were only a mattter of time, both from the ease-of-implementation standpoint, as well as the sheer historical/economic/technological "obviousness" and necessity of it. In this sense, NSA appears like many big organizations I've worked for: out of touch with many emerging aspects of reality due to an internal culture that quickly recognizes those who aren't going to tow the line. The only thing they can do is slow things down. Crypto-based virtual structures will inevitably arise if for no other reason than there's going to be a lot of $$$ in it (kinda ironic, I think...).
HOWEVER, the conspiracy theorist in me still wonders if all of "this" was not precisely because it was recognized that we are rapidly passing through the point of no return. This "Illuminati"  may have decided drastic measures were needed "in order to save all that we hold dear"(which in their case means control of the unempowered and unwashed masses by the powerful). No, I don't think I believe this, but the circumstantial evidence is compelling enough so as to demand careful evaluation.
Uh..."hope for"? Surely if things ever come to where somthing as terrible as this could reasonably be hoped for, it is only after all possible alternatives have been pursued. And as far as I'm concerned, if a computer I can purchase from Circuit City is now powerful enough for the (completely decentralized!) peer-to-peer sharing of massive files and heavy crypto, then it looks to me like it's just a matter of time until many of the objectionable activities become not only obviously pointless, but suprisingly out-of-funds.

OK, let's assume for the same of argument that it takes about 1 minute for Echelon/NSA-like resources to break a weakly encypted lotus notes message. And then let's assume that there's a whole LOT of these machines sitting And as the grumpy Tim May has suggested, perhaps only a small fraction of encrypted messages are (or can be) sent for decryption.
Then the expenditure of such resources is going to be a big statistical optimization problem, akin to that faced in the credit card industry (eg, in approving or declining a POS transaction).
The gub'mint or whatever doing such monitoring will therefore probably look for certain signs that will kick off decryption. For instance, the sporadic use of cryptography in cetain demogrpahic areas might cause a % of those to be sent over for routine check, particularly if there is no encryption used by that populace, and then all of a sudden there are bursts.
Also, changing the strength of encryption might be a kickoff, but again I reveal I am a newbie with this question: Is it possible to determine (at least approximately) the strength of encryption of an intercepted message?
Then, if someone from, say, the b'Arbes neighborhood of Paris moves suddenly from weak to strong encryption in his messaging, that would kick off a flag somewhere sending that message for cracking.
So if a bin Laden were smart, he should routinely use encryption for all of his messages, even the most trivial, because the change in pattern would be a tipoff to send his encrypted messages for hacking.
And the there are probably less obvious, large-scale statistical patterns indicating something's up, and causing a % of such messages to be hacked and then sent for routine check for key words.

Let's also say that "somebody" knows this, and can search byte streams for known strings of products of these primes. They can then break this cypherstream very easily.
Meanwhile, someone who doesn't know that the code's been tampered with can try to break the cypherstream using traditional brute force methods, and it will appear that this is a truly hard-encrypted message.

AND if this is possible, is there some way to examine the encrypted output and then, say, search for unusual frequency traces of certain sequences, and determine tha the code has been tampered with?

Well,I disagree about psuedo random number generation, sort of.
First, if I have PSR sequence of the known variety (ie, ANSI or ITU), and if it's mapped to some telecom standard (DS-1/3, OC-3/12/48/192), then my test set can and should be able to lock onto that sequence. This is true whether that telecom signal is raw PRBS, or if it has been mapped into the payload (you use different test sets).
In addition, PRBS have a very distinctive trace signature in the frequency domain. SO if I run my PRBS-mapped telecom signal into an O/E (if it's optical, for instance), and then into an Electrical Signal Analyzer, I'll be able to see if the characteristic Electrical Frequency spectrum matches that expected for, say PRBS-23.If it doesn't, I know something's up. If it does, it CAN of course be something else, but that signal does have the right amount of entropy.
With encrypted info who knows? I would think that testing if there's monkey business might boil down to algorithms--ie, if certain bit patterns happen too often, then something's wrong...

As a result of this collaboration, Ingrian now delivers the highest level of SSL security and private key protection available in a single security platform.
This breakthrough capability, now available in Ingrians i215 and i225 secure networking platforms, is the result of collaborating with nCipher to ensure its cryptographic modules are compliant with the FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) 140-2 Level 3 specification for protection of private cryptographic keys. This new specification significantly enhances the security of SSL transactions and virtually eliminates the threat of cyber attacks via SSL tunnels.
Sensitive business data is only as secure as the private keys that protect that data, said Rod Murchison, VP of Product and Corporate Development at Ingrian Networks. If a cyber attacker gets the master key, it can unlock a lot of sensitive data and be very costly to businesses. This new FIPS-compliant technology offers customers the most advanced security available for private cryptographic keys and SSL transactions. Its the level of protection that a growing number of customers want and expect from Ingrian platforms.

In antoher context I've wondered about the possibility of wireless, near-real-time video upload. With 3G this will cetainly be easy, but I'm wondering if there are soft/hard gadgets that can auto-upload stuff.(In addition, 3G looks like it's going to roll out in the US only in fits and starts over the next bunch of years.)
Ideally, this upload would be made directly to WWW, but upload to a safe-haven would certainly be better than nothing (particularly if one does not even have any knowledge about where some copies of the upload are auto-uploaded to!).
Anyone done anything like this?

Well, this simplifies things, as it should for an Encyclopedia entry, but it doesn't explain the "Peking" 'transliteration'. As I said before, there is no sound "king" in Mandarin. And indeed, "jing" means capital in Mandarin. So what this paragraph refers to as "Peking" was always pronounced by Chinese as "Beijing" to each other. The British, however, introduced the pronunciation "Peking" for some reason. (I may have the history in one of my books which I'll peruse tonight.)

Well, it should be pointed out that learning to read Chinese is not so unlike learning to read phonetic languages as one might think.
Remember first of all that Chinese does not have "2,000 letters". Each of the characters is a word, or in some cases two or three characters form a word. Each character is also made up after an assembly of "radicals", or basic building blocks (actually, only one of the sub-characters is referred to as 'the' radical, and that's how they look up a character in a Chinese And remember that when learning to read, being able to pronounce the word based on its letters does little for you (when you're small) unless you know the meaning of that word. So young Enlglish readers have to learn word-by-word just like young Chinese readers. The english readers get some help by being able to sound out the word, but the Chinese reader can possibly pick out the radical and get something of a hint.
That said, it IS harder learning to read and write in Chinese, and this is why Beijing has indicated its desire to put away the characters one day. (But that will never happen.)

Interesting. I'll have to read that J-STD-025A.
ALAMEDA, Calif. -- MetaSwitch, supplier of the VP3500, the industry's first true Next Generation Class 5 Switch, announced today that it has completed an extensive review with the FBI, which demonstrates that the MetaSwitch CALEA specification meets the J-STD-025A standard for circuit switching CALEA, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, requires that U.S. carriers provide Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) with the continued ability to perform electronic surveillance with existing and new telecommunications switching equipment. Electronic surveillance consists of either the interception of call content (commonly referred to as wiretaps) and/or the interception of call-identifying information (commonly referred to as dialed-number extraction).
"We simplified providing CALEA compliance for our customers by incorporating CALEA functionality on-board the MetaSwitch VP3500 rather than requiring additional external equipment", said John Lazar, Vice President of Sales and Marketing. "We are ensuring the completeness of our solution with ongoing testing with the FBI."
In light of the current uncertainty in world events, electronic surveillance is becoming increasingly important as a tool for law enforcement agencies. Therefore it is vital that vendors and telecommunications carriers develop and deploy solutions that support electronic surveillance, in both traditional TDM and next generation packet-based networks.
Technical requirements or standards for CALEA capabilities have been established for several categories of telecommunications by industry associations or standard-setting organizations, in consultation with representatives of the law enforcement community.

"[If GPS dies] "Internet activity would slow to a crawl, because many

Sounds like bullshit to me, data clocks should be able to run without
being fully synched externally, constantly.
Maybe very occasional minor glitches at boundaries of clock domains.
Any SONET Gurus wanna comment?"
Sure, but I don't know enough about IP to tell you.
SONET networks derive their timing from a STRATUM1 clock, which used to be Cesium but which are increasingly GPS-based.
If the STRATUM1 clock "dies", the network can look for another high-quality clock. If it doesn't find one, each NE will go into hold-over, and time of of the internal STRATUM (likely 2e) clock until a good clock reappears.
But the time stamps for SONET clocks are in the DS1 overhead, so the packets in the (other) DS1s/DS3s, etc...never "see" that timestamp, unless that timestamp is somehow read by a router and then put into the packets. But does a router  even GET timing? (ie, is there a BITS interface on a router? I don't think so.)
In any event, if the router gets its timing from the SONET network then there's no problem. If they don't get their timing from SONET, I doubt they get it directly from a GPS.
So it sounds like bullshit to me.

"I'm not a SONET guru, but my understanding is that even with the
internal clocks, you would see at worst an occasional error burst for
a few ms.  No credible engineer would make a network that fell over
without GPS anyway, since it's just too easy for someone to
accidentally knock over your antenna while installing another, or nick
the cable with a saw, or who knows what.  In a nutshell, this isn't
something I'd worry about."
SONET Synchronization is not a thing that can easily be discussed in any short amount of time. Synch in a SONET network is "provisioned", NE-by-NE, and if its done right then the chances of timing slips are very low.
However, in certain cases you can have a big timing "island", and in this case over the course of days you'll start to see more and more slips until that whole Island pretty much disconnects from the rest of the network. (This can happen when the primary reference fails, and when the reamining NEs all get their timing from each other in a big loop, like a snake eating its tail. The whole clock for this island begins to drift wrt the rest of the network, and in some cases there can eventually be enough slips as to cause some NEs to declare AIS. However, if Synch was provisioned correctly this won't be seen.)
The existence of possible timing islands, owever, should not be strongly associated with the loss of GPS. Traditionally, SONET networks use Cesium clocks as their primary reference source.GPSs have only started to proliferate in order to simplify synch. So in order for GPS cancellation to do anything at all to the internet, you'd have to have a network that has no access to ANY stratum1 clock (Cesium or GPS), you'd have to have old NEs in that network (ie, with a poor internal SONET clock), AND you'd have to have a timing island. And even then, only this island would be affected. If this island were in the middle of UUNet, you might see some slowdown.
As for routers I'll take it that they can read timing out of the Synch Status Byte (S1 in the SONET overhead), so they'll "know" what the problem is at least (ie, that byte will tell them what the quality of the synch is). If the line clock is bad, I'd guess that the big Cisco routers will go into "holdover" (or whatever router heads call holdover), and that's the time they'll use to stamp the flows with.
So, no problem I'm 99.9% sure. (And I'm rarely that sure of anything.)

They can then "withdraw" an equivalent number of hours from the bank in terms of the goods and services of the other bank memebers.
Strangely, in some parts of the country the system has so proliferated some communities that they have issued "money" that can be spent in local shops. This money is "backed" by X hours in the time bank. There're some people who actually collect these time bank tokens.

U.S. officials on Monday charged Maher "Mike" Hawash, an Arab-American who had been detained since March, with conspiracy to help a suspected cell of people accused of aiding al Qaeda and Taliban forces.
Maher Mofeid Hawash, 39, of Hillsboro, Oregon, was charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to levy war against the United States, conspiracy to provide material support to al Qaeda and conspiracy to contribute services to al Qaeda and the Taliban.
Hawash, a software contractor with Intel, had been held since March 20, sparking an outcry from supporters who protested the high level of secrecy surrounding legal proceedings against him.
The Justice Department said in a statement that Hawash was believed to be involved in the same activities as the "Portland Six" -- a group indicted in the fall of 2002 and accused by Attorney General John Ashcroft of being part of a "suspected terrorist cell."
Hawash was charged with the same violations as Jeffrey Leon Battle, Patrice Lumumba Ford, Ahmed Abrahim Bilal, Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal, Habis Abdullah Al Saoub and October Martinique Lewis. All six previously charged defendants had lived in Portland, Oregon.
Five of the six are in custody. Al Saoub is still at large and is believed to be outside the United States.
The complaint said U.S. officials identified Hawash based on evidence seized at the time of the other arrests and from evidence gained through follow-up According to the criminal complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Portland, Hawash decided after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States to travel to Afghanistan to join forces with Taliban and al Qaeda troops fighting there. The United States, which blames Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terror network for masterminding the strikes that killed more than 3,000, launched the attack in Afghanistan to uproot the country's Islamic fundamentalist Taliban government.
Hawash is accused of traveling with the other defendants to China in an attempt to enter Afghanistan and fight against U.S. forces. Hawash returned to the United States in November 2001 after failing to enter Afghanistan.
The complaint says Hawash claimed his travel to China was related to his personal software business.
Hawash was initially detained as a material witness in a secret grand jury investigation. The material witness designation allowed Hawash to be held indefinitely without being charged. According to an investigation by the Washington Post, at least 44 others have been held in secret as material witnesses by authorities in terrorism-related investigations. The American Civil Liberties Union has condemned the government's detention of the Friends of Hawash, led by former Intel executive Steven McGeady, continue to campaign for his release.
According to the campaign website, Free Mike Hawash, the evidence against Hawash is weak.
"The evidence presented in the complaint is, in our opinion, weak, and amounts to guilt by association," says a statement on the site. "The government had a weak case when he was originally detained  and has no stronger a case now.
"We will continue to stand by Mike," the statement continues. "We believe in his innocence, and believe that he will ultimately be cleared of all Reuters contributed to this report.

Well, on one hand taking justice into one's own hands opens the doors to pretty much anything anybody can think of that ticks them off.
On the other hand, there are clearly times and societies where such an approach is warranted. The usual exmples have already been given. These examples seem to have at their intersection a time where the government (and the powers that be) are themselves immune from legal consequence and above the law, while 'enforcing' laws that are innately evil. Such a society has pretty much boiled down to "might makes right", and such a government is a government in name only.
The question then becomes, when do we know when we've entered such a time? More specifically, have we in the US entered such a time? And if we have not, does it not at least appear that we might, soon? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, then Tim May's suggestion is not a matter of "if", but "when". If the Koran becomes outlawed but a librarian rats on a Muslim trying to access the Koran online, then is this not much different from the Nazi days? Of course, we believe that the librarian is trying to "do the right thing". But do you really think that enthusiastic Hitler followers believed they were evil?

@_subject: Is Matel Stalinist? 
Well, I wouldn't apply the word "oppressive" across the board to the cultures of big companies, but the fact is that modern American coporate culture more often than not imitates a top-down, 'statist' culture that is so universal we rarely recognize it.
For instance, high-level strategic decisions are made almost entirely in the vacuum of power. And often, that's appropriate. But many times, the actual people who do the work and know the most about the subject are completely out of the loop. Silicon Valley at its best operates in a very different way...companies are far more driven from the product/technology/service perspective, instead of imagining that balance sheets can make a Lucent into a Cisco. (And at its best, if some hot engineers along with a couple of useful management types feel strongly enough about a missed opportunity, they just split off and start doing it.)
But the best of Sillicon Valley is a rare exception. Most of the time "they" make decisions and people who are the technical experts must merely quietly implement those decisions. It's interesting to imagine what would have happened to Lucent if, for instance, the employees could have voted on the acquisition of Chromatis. They would have quickly realized that they were getting a raw $3B deal on a mediocre product, AND that they already had something equivalent ready in-house.
Retail is the absolute worst. FOr whatever reason (and I don't believe it has anything to do with competitiveness), big CD or Book chains never empower or reward employees on their ability to purchase books for their store that sell well. In fact, almost zero real purchasing decisions are done locally.
But nobody seems to notice...we're completely used to being passive cogs in a big, fat machine-state. So in a sense, it's gone way beyond 'repression'...no need for that rat-cage around our heads anymore.

Not only do they have a "local authors" section which is larger than the similar section at the "local" bookstore, but they have a sophisticated system for re-ordering books based on sales. If a title sells, they know it. And can order replacements."
Nothing particularly socialist about my original statement. I was trying to point out how the knee-jerk mimicry of top-down structures prevented even big companies from making as much money as they could, by awarding and leveraging local talent and information.  It would be nice to think that part of Border's success is from doing some of this. As for the small, independent bookstores, I personally helped trounce one in particular...the owner was not only a know-it-all DICK he really wasn't a very good businessman. He tried to tell his customers that they should want what he was selling and it didn't work. (Every now and then I'd try to send a customer or two his way to get the kind of books the Central Office wouldn't let us carry, and on several occasions the reply was "No thank you, I'm never shopping THERE again...").
So I'm not advocating 'requiring' big retail companies to get smarter, nor am I advocating non-shopping at the big Borders and Barnes and Nobles. My point was that a lot of corporate cultures blindly mimic hierarchies even when that's not appropriate, because it just about the only social model anyone's ever experienced.
Well, I'm thinking of the Lucents, Nortels and Alcatels of the world. Oh, and all the big old financial houses as well. Those two sectors I can claim some decent familiarity with (I too am a shareholder in various companies). When Lucent bought Chromatis, or when Sandy Weil told Jack Grubman to uppe his rating on AT&T or...well, these major, corporation-shaking decisions were pretty much made in a vacuum of power. There's no way shareholders could give the thumbs-down to those absurd deals, or even (really) chuck out those responsible.
Of course, you'll argue that the shareholders could vote with their feet until something was done, but that's besides the point. The point here is that shareholders, Boardmembers, and upper management alike are so used to an environment where little or no feedback is possible that something like this happens so often. I'm not saying "there should be a law"...it's a cultural thing, and the culture sucks, because we're used to being told what to do by somebody else who's "in charge".
Not so fast my fine, crypto-fascist friend. Let's look at Grubman. At the time Sandy Weil gave him his marching orders he probably had (at least) 10s of millions of dollars-worth of immature Citigroup options. You can also bet he was paying out the friggin WAZOO for whatever upper-east-side space he had (as well as whatever East Hampton 'bungalo' he had). So in a way, he was on the hook, and stood to make a hell of a lot more on the AT&T deal. So he probably didn't really WANT to put lipstick on that pig, but he didn't have a lot of choice. (OK, he had plenty of choice, but that's a different Now let's say some kind of really sophisticated blacknet were available, able to support even short-selling and whatnot. In that case Grubman might have secretly shorted the AT&T deal and then given Sandy the finger, all the while preserving his tattered (but then still-salvagable) reputation as at least an "honest" pump-and-dump analyst, while being able to keep himself afloat in high-end hookers and other goodies (that's what I would have in the deal so that real market forces could tear it apart like pirana, which is what should have happened.

@_subject: Has this photo been de-stegoed? 
Well, that sounds reasonable on the face of it, but there's got to be a lot more discussion before I'm convinced.
Remember that psuedorandom or encrypted data has a certain noise spectrum. This noise spectrum is extremely different based on what PRBS one is using...PRBS 2^23-1 looks completely different from other 'noise' (and remember noise is a relative term).
If you spatially fft a random photo, you'll find that the image detail energy largely occupies certain bands. These are not the bands that stego uses (or so I assume...it really can't be otherwise). The stego-able spectrum will indeed be noise, but this noise will have a certain spectrum.
Stego, done well, will I assume try to mimic this noise, but there may be problems. If the message is encrypted, then merely loading that message into the photo will, I assume, NOT result in a noise spectrum that looks like real noise. So you'll need some kind of chopper or spectrum-spreader I If no chopper's used, however, I'm guessing that stego-ed 'noise' doesn't look like true photo noise. If the photo has been de-stegoed stupidly (ie, by writing a random message in its place), that noise won't look like photo noise. So it seems to me that you'd need a sophisticated agent to make the de-steoed photo look like it never had stego. In other words, if the FBI are your man-in-the-middle, then you'll be able to detect that the photo was de-stegoed.

"How do you know the signature of the unaltered carrier-medium?
E.g., have you measured the LSBit noise from my camera recently?
Under which lighting conditions?"
Well, having done some optical signal processing (and getting a patent in that area, come to think of it), I imagined that most photos will naturally have some image noise in certain frequency bands...this noise would not have to have anything to do with your camera or whatever, but is probably a function of what's in the image. For instance, a picture of a naked girl standing in front of drywall probably has very little useful image energy in spatial frequencies represented down at the length of a pixel. In a spatial fft there's probably a lot of low frequency white noise for a while, until you get to the level of the shorter body hairs and whatnot. And then there may be spatial freuency bands between that and her height that are nearly unoccupied with image energy.
information goes. I also imagined that if it were done in a very simple way, the stegoed info will be fairly obvious to someone knowledgeable and looking at the spatial fft of the image. I imagine that it will look obvious because, to an expert, it won't look like the authentic kind of noise expected there. If the information is encrypted, I consider it possible that the noise may even look too "perfect" perhaps.
If that's true, then I suspect it's often possible to determine that a photo's stego has been removed. Or at least, there will be cases where stego removal will be "obvious".
Come to think of it, I bet TLA operatives are given precise instructions about what kinds of photos make for undiscernable stego (I'd bet where the spatial image information is not well-concentrated into "bands"). In other words, a photo with all different-sized objects in it. Perhaps they even travel with some photos for just this purpose.
Hum. I wonder if photos of "clouds" work well for this purpose. That would actually explain something I encountered recently....

Oh I have certainly experienced those back in my retail days during college. I was working in a Waldenbooks where the auto-inventory was sent based on sales (as a scaling factor). The store I worked at was basically quite small, but with Class A sales, so during some seasons we were DUMPED with books that we simply couldn't keep up with. They were eventually thrown out or listed as "shrinkage". (But all of that was behind the scenes...the customers couldn't SEE the pileup.)
But, notice how Waldenbooks has gotten WACKED by these big Borders' and B&Ns. Maybe these are smarter (or, these "giant" bookstores don't really need to consider shelf space...).

My only regret was that I made $3.35/hour to do it.)
Food is different from music or books, however. Books are much less of a commodity in that a particular neighborhood may respond very strongly to certain types of books, and ignore other kinds. Inventory systems can't really get the ball rolling on that kind of thing...they don't tell you what the locals want (but you don't have), they only tell you what they've already bought. Thus, a well-run chain would hire smart local college kids and let them order (in additionto the "basics" that come from the inventory systems). What I've yet to see is where a low-level retail kid is actually given a piece of the action: "Here kid...if you increase the sales of this Sci-Fi section by 45% then you'll get 2% of each book sold after that." I'd like to see a chain try that kind of a thing, but that seems WAY too down-up for most corporate cultures.

A thread that started out quasi-interesting has descended into non-Cypherpunk levels of triviality.
The original point stands, and is valid. The Islamic world and, in particular, the Arabic part of the Islamic world, are probably going to forget their dislike of Saddam when they see those newreels of the great Dictator being rubbergloved and de-loused. For them it's almost certainly going to resound as a symbol of how we've systematically manipulated and fucked them over all these years. They're not going to respect our "Power", they're not going to care much that WE supported Saddam in the first place. They're just going to get angrier. Look for bin Laden to grow in status until he's just a notch or two below Mohammed. Look then for more bombings and 9/11s here in the US. That Saddam was a cruel, butchering dictator will soon be nearly irrelevant.

You really get a lot of things mixed up. If you think Ho Chi Minh was a KGB sockpuppet then you really don't know anything about Vietnam, China, or East Asian history. Think of Ho Chi Min as, utlimately, a violent pragmatist...he was going to get his guns from whoever he could, and that's what he did. He also had Chinese guns and, during WWII, American guns (yes: We were allied with Ho Chi Minh against the Japanese during WWII).
Likewise, you accused Saddam Hussein of being allied with bin Laden, which is also silly. In fact, bin Laden has regularly called for Saddam's death, and I see no reason to believe he wasn't serious.

Well, again you've WAY oversimplified things.
Indeed, this oversimplification is curiously identical to US foregin policy Ho Chi Min, like Mao, would take guns from anybody in order to get the job done. If that meant wearing a Soviet uniform for 15 minutes, then sobeit. Don't mistake that for Eastern-European-style Soviet block "governments".
Was Ho Chi Min ultimately a dictator? Sure. A Soviet-style dictator? Well, I'd argue only nominally. I'd also argue that our post World War II betrayal of Ho had a lot to do with shoving him into the arms of the Soviets, just like with Mao. (But in neither case did the association stick.) The important notion is that, unlike in Europe, China and Vietnam never had anything resembling a democracy or Parliament or anything like that. They were still largely fuedal, agrarian societies that weren't really in a position to critically evaluate the implications of Soviet-style rulership (and in fact they probably viewed it as being merely a non-Monarchic version of what they'd always done). BUT...the Soviets were providing guns and money and we weren't.
That both countries were really only externally Stalinst for a brief while (ie, a couple of decades) is evidenced by the fact that both economies are as about, in SOME ways, as free-wheeling and as capitalistic as exists these days. Of course, both are still certainly authoritarian and, depending on the subject, oppressive, but this has nothing to do with their politico-economic stance per se, as is now obvious.
In other words, the moral of this story is that you can't merely graft on a western political philosophy--in this case Marxism--to cultures that have unbroken traditions dating back to the stone age. It may look 'Marxist' on the outside, but internally that transplant ain't going to take root.
That US foreign policy in the far east in in Indo-China during most decades of the 20th century was a complete disaster was precisely due to the views you seem to hold. It's why we didn't back Mao when even though it was obvious BILLIONS of dollars were being siphoned away by Soong Tse-Vung and the Chiang regime...it's why we backed Lon Nol to overthrow Sihounouk (bringing in the Khmer rouge), and it's why we didn't back Ho even though he fought with us against the Japanese.
Had we stood back from our prejudices, respected the soverignity of those nations, engaged and offered some guns in order for them to choose their OWN government, I'd bet the era of Soviet-style government in both China and Vietnam would have been much shorter, and in Cambodia it would have CERTAINLY never existed.
In other words, YOU (and people with beliefs just like yours in the US government) are responsible for the spread of communism in the far east. Now you and your friends (including, I suspect, the guy who signs your paycheck) are going to do the same thing in the near east: you're going to force many ostensibly neutral nations into the Fundamentalist Islamic camp, because you just don't get it, and think we have the right to interfere.
"Well, the Soviets did it and the liberal left said it was great, so that makes it right." Forget it. Stop saying this crap and use that brain. 9/11 sucked enough in this town...we don't need another.

I know he's into some wierd stuff...I saw his wife with a black eye once, and his kids don't look so happy or healthy.
One day at the supermarket his cart crashed into mine. It may have been an accident, but I'm not quite sure. But the guy gave me an eye, so he's clearer a threat to me.
So what I did the other day was I broke into the guy's house...it was late and I took him by surpise so when he was coming down the stairs I shot him. His older son came at me with a baseball bat, so I had to shoot him too. When I finally got to the wife the ungrateful bitch started crying and begged me not to kill her..."DAMMIT, I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU YOU STUPID BITCH" I said to her, but she didn't seem to feel any better.
Actually, I'm typing this message from her house, because if I leave the cops'll get me and maybe some more of the guy's relatives will come, and then we'll be right back where we started. I've got no plans to leave here for at least 2 to 3 years. Funny thing is, though, every now and then when I'm coming down the stairs there will be tacks or nails or something at the bottom. I'm starting to get the idea they don't want me here!

My comment was more general, and not necessarily aimed at Germany per se. For instance, there theoretically seems to be laws about everything in Italy, but nobody seems to obey them and they are only enforced half-heartedly, and for as long as it's in vogue to give a crap.
Likewise, Communist "Land Reform" in mainland China isn't communist so much as it's Chinese: land reform and nationalisation of salt production and other industries have regularly occurred throughout Chinese history. "Communism" in mainland China was a mask that seemed to last about as long as Mao was alive. (Of course, the hardheads on this list will reply by saying that Chinese culture has always been more "communistic" than other countries, but then this statement ignores just how truly capitalist China has become since 1984 or so. It remains oppressive, of course, if you're discussing the wrong subjects....)
Yes...because we Americans have only had one government, we tend to equate "legality" with morality, and then assume the discussion is over. No doubt that causes us to look at laws "over there" as being far more important than they really are...at least some times.

Yes...that's the thing I don't fully get. If we assume that Mr May made a big chunk of $$$ at Intel, isn't it rather naive of him to assume that the same system that helped make Intel the global $$$-generator it is isn't the same system that keeps black folks quiescent and so on? I think it's doubtful that Intel could have become what it is in any other country in the Add to that the fact that Mr May seems to lead a fairly bucolic life (from his accounts)...working in his gardens, installing tripwires and landmines and so forth, apparently without worrying about cash or physical needs. So this system has served him pretty well, insofar as there was a place for him to apply his skills in order to make his $$$. That system was payed for by somebody else's taxes, and now it's asking (well, demanding from) him for some $$$ that he apparently can easily afford.
This doesn't necessarily annhilate his "arguments" or main thesis, but in this light the call for the killing of millions so that he can afford a few more landmines seems perplexing.
As for the middle east and US foreign policy, I'd be more convinced if Mr May and others pointed to that as a main reason to stop paying taxes and back out of the system. In other words, that there may or may not be any 'inherent' flaw to a fairly light form of "statism", but that it's defacto application (in the case of the US) is creating a seriously destabilized global political environment, while decreasingly serving (though a piss-poor education system) those that ought to benefit from taxes and spending. (This was why I became interested in "Crypto-Anarchy".)
Of course, I'll add the usual boiler-plate notion invoked by physicists, mathematicians, and hard-scientists almost universally, in their heart of hearts: Only mathematics and experimental physics (as a thought system or philisophy) are truly reliable and able to make definitive conclusions about the world...all other so-called systems of thought (including sociology, political 'science', economics and so on) are half-baked hodge podges at best. Therefore, any thought system that has as a corrollary "...and 40 million negros should die..." should immediately be suspect of having been based on a foundation of non-mathematical muck, likely relating to penis envy and getting rejected by some hot black chick Mr May tried to date back in 1957 or whatever.

This is an idealization, of course, and to the extent that it was true I agree with some of the main conclusions here. Another idealization is that, once in a while, someone will get caught in a downsizing or without a job for a while. Knowing that some small cushion existed allowed those with fairly minimal capital to take the kinds of risks implicit in what you're talking about.
"The meme which Tyler Durden and John Young--not surprising to me that both are Manhattanites, representing the East Coast view of capitalism--are popularizing is the one that says that what made companies successful was *government spending*, not this compact which needed little or no government role, and that this makes government intervention in business justifiable. Even more mendacious is the claim that those who worked hard and risked their capital by investing in companies are profiting at the expense of the "less privileged." "
Well. I wasn't exactly trying to say that. At least, "Intel was successful because the government gave it tax breaks..."...that's what I'm NOT saying. However, add my point above to the notion that the whole American social fabric probably can not be separated into small discete chunks, and you get my point. Or at least, the logic that compels one to conclude that the murder of 40 million African Americans is justifiable should somehow make one take those notions with a grain of salt.
Intel or National Semiconductor doesn't and never did exist in a vacuum. They were started by great engineers and physicsts that were educated in places like Stanford, or that worked in Bell Labs. And this isn't an argument for tax-and-spend 'statism' per se, but simply that there's a social/political/economic environment that can't be diced and sliced. You'd dice and slice an African American population, but then again it's from these inner cities that much of popular American culture has arisen (ie, between pro sports, various forms of music and so on...). Who knows the impact these people have had in terms of providing 'content' for the chips and TV screens and so on.

"For some reason I've never been able to fathom, many journalists seem to be remarkably gullable, when they're told something from the right kind of source, especially a government agency or other official source."
Chomsky (dig around on  and others have commented on this quite a bit. What it seems to boil down to is a sort of natural selection. Basically, it works like this:
1) Government is releasing some cool smart-bomb commercials, erh I mean video to a few select news sources.
2) NBC sends a questioning, smart, well-informed dude to said press 3) During said smart-bomb footage notices the Arabic word for Hospital on the top of the smart-bombs target, and asks "Is that a hospital?"
4) Government takes NBC off list of cool "insider" info: "Can't be trusted, not playing ball"
5) NBC, now out in the cold, assigns said informed journalist to covering Ruwanda or other low-profile stuff, and assures military officials that they'll send someone a little more cooperative next time.
I'm exagerating for effect here of course...there's possibly not as much conscious decision making, and supposedly this kind of list-making happens for much quieter, "insider" stuff (not smart bomb footage). But clearly, there's got to be SOMETHING like this happening.

Well, there's some truth here but a lot of oversimplification as well.
I'd argue that the US patent system (or at least the thoughtof it) had a lot to do with the ability of inventors to take risks, gather startup capital, and get a product rolling. There is first of all the perception that their "secret sauce" is to some extent protected (as are the time & $ investments), as well as the actual protection (litigation actually works once in a while, and the threat thereof has kept some from copying to soon and too closely). This environment has had a major effect on technological That's not to say it can't happen in other environments, but it seems to unfold very differently in, say, China or the USSR (which actually has contributed lots of technological and scientific ideas to the world). But none of them have benefited $$$-wise (nor has the pace been nearly as fast) as in the US.
Meanwhile, regulations and governments can give some industries a head start, particularly if a "jungle" already holds a nice warm niche for the output of those industries. Thus Sematec helped US semiconductors to roar back from the brink of extinction, and the buying up (and subsequent dismantling) of lite rail systems in the LA basin in the 30s and 40s apparently had a major impact on the rollout of vehicles Might we have seen much better public transportation in that area if this capitalist coup-d'etat hadn't occurred? The moon shots did apparently accelerate the development of semiconductors.
(A side note should be made here about the fact that some technologies have a very high activation energy barrier...without a very intensive amount of capital, they can't happen. Indeed, aren't we nearly at that point with sub-0.13um technology? It is possible that further advances just won't be possible without direct or indirect government funding.)
The best technology does not always win. In fact, the concept of "best technology" is kinda shakey most of the time. There are sociological, political, and other factors than can alter the course of things for a That said, the technological "survival of the fittest" notion seems to be a fairly constant undercurrent that re-asserts itself periodically as the various sociological ephemera come and go. Like Kuhn or Popper, these aren't the only drivers, but they are certainly one of the axes.

Any comments? Impact statement anyone?
SOMERSET, N.J. -- More than 75 percent of survey respondents believe that browser-based SSL (secure sockets layer) VPN (virtual private network) technology is �somewhat� to �highly� likely to replace IPSec-based VPNs for remote access to enterprise resources over the next two years, according to the latest survey on enterprise network security trends from The Tolly Group, a premier IT testing and consulting firm. Netilla� Networks, Inc., a leading provider of SSL VPN solutions for secure Web-based access to any corporate application, co-sponsored the survey along with Check Point Software, Nortel Networks, Ingrian Networks and Enterasys Networks.
Survey respondents also projected that the most likely future uses for SSL VPNs will be for securing Web services (67 percent), followed by securing extranets and e-business services (54 percent), providing remote access for business partners (50 percent) and enabling remote access by mobile and teleworking employees (48 percent).
SSL-based VPN appliances use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption engineered into today�s Web browsers to provide simple, browser-based remote access to centrally hosted corporate applications. Unlike traditional remote access solutions based on the IPSec standard, SSL-based VPNs do not require application or VPN client software to be configured and maintained on remote PCs, which reduces IT support costs while increasing usability.
�Overall, respondents demonstrated a significant surge in the usage of SSL-based VPNs,� said Kevin Tolly, president and chief executive officer of The Tolly Group. �Just two years ago, SSL VPNs were nowhere on the map, but now interest in the technology is starting to mature. However, these same users also cited a lack of general understanding on how to deploy SSL VPNs as a potential roadblock. Vendors must step up SSL education to help users better understand the benefits of this technology.�

I agree with this assessment, but would also suggest that Tim May's old-fogeyism has some validity to it. As far as I'm concerned, the state has successfully bonded with big media to pretty much stifle a lot of critical thinking, particularly about what other Americans believe. We saw it with the war protests--despite the fact that the numbers were larger than during Vietnam, the media was successful in (first of all) convincing Americans that the vast majority of Americans supported the war/troops/president. After that, since most Americans believed the right thing was to support the war (because "everybody else supports it"), they then came to quasi-support it, or at least shut up about it. And still, no Osama, no Saddam, and no WMD, but only "kooks" and "commies" are screaming about it.
Thus, to go back o your point, you're starting off with a small population of dissenters, so that once you pass down through the needs for engineering and math skills, you're left with very little.
On the other hand, the only thing that's stopping me from coding up my "eJector"  is a full time job and trying to live in the little spare time I have. So I guess I'm in the population you describe and will be, as long as I remain employed.

A couple of corrections, then the comment. First is that tubes boost the even order harmonics, making the sound much richer and fuller sounding. Also, the Krell is digital, not tube.
But your point is correct, but also well-known within audiophile circles. In fact, single-end triode style tube amps (which hit the market about 10 years ago) have really rotten measureables, but they have continued to grow in popularity because of the the allegedly "live/lush" sound. (Another odd thing about them is that they have extremely low output powers--12W, 8W and 6W are common!) Everyone knows they are basically nearly random tone-control gizmos, but no one cares at this point.
As for 24/96 (or 24/192), like I said there are real engineering reasons for doing this, but in the end there's not much reason to argue if you haven't heard. Go listen to a standard CD played on an upsampling machine and you will know in no uncertain terms that the sound is considerably better/fuller/realler. (A hint as to why can be seen when you look a square wave reproduced in 16/22 vs 24/96.)
As for audiophile voodoo there's a lot out there, but there's a pretty easy way to differentiate voodoo from real (though 'inexplicable') high-end stuff. The voodoo dissappears within a year or two, but the real stuff keeps A PS about double-blind: There's been lots of them done, some confirming audiophile expectations some contradicting. Some of the disparity is due to who the blindees are: high-end listening is a skill that is basically self-taught.

My Thiel speakers, however, claim to be "phase coherent", and that seems to be an entirely different matter. In other words, the different frequency components of a sound are transmitted in correct phase relationships (ie, true to the original sound), and the result is a (sometimes) astonishing level of spacial detail. Of course, non-audiophiles will poo-poo that claim, but even they will hear that the Thiels are far more accurate than the crap that's sold in Circuit City or whatever.

"Then your ears are not golden, period."
But you misunderstand what the phase button does. If the speakers are wired out of phase anybody can hear that. Actually, it's a quite interesting thing to hear...nothing is really localizable.
But the phase button inverts the absolute phase of the signal coming out of both speakers. In other words, with a bass drum hit do the speaker cones move outward at the initial strike or inward (as they are not supposed to). Supposedly this difference can be heard, but my speakers start rolling off below 100Hz, so I suspect that's why I have a very hard time discerning the absolute phase difference when I hit the button.

It's an entirely different thing if, by using a virtual keyboard, "they" have to do the same thing for millions of people.

Also, and I'm not sure what this implies yet, but the screen-emitted beam has lowest energy after hitting a letter, which is black.

Actually, that's an interesting point. Let's first of all remember that Gilmore was allowed onto the plane in the first place, so airport security didn't care or notice. And it doesn't seem that onboard Gilmore was causing a ruckus or creating the sense of insecurity. And I'm willing to bet that none of the staff actually felt/believed that the guy was a threat (let's assume they have the right to remove somebody that perceived to be a threat). So clearly this was punitive.
No don't get me wrong, I would have thought the guy was a little bit of dick for "spooking the straights", and I would have been tempted (note the word tempted) to punch that button off of him so we didn't have to turn around.
But it sounds like a rehash of the mall incident...had he walked onto the flight with a button that said "I support our troops", he wouldn't have been thrown off. Thus everyone has become a kind of thought cop....but what they're enforcing is not the collective perceived reality, but what most people believe the collective perceived reality is supposed to be. There're cracks already though, and the fact that NY Times ran that photo on the front page the other day means a lot, actually...

"So it's best to ignore the "unwashed masses" and their inability to understand untraceable money."
That's precisely the wrong conclusion, assuming everything else you wrote in this post is correct.
If one accepts that most young people don't understand the notion or implications of truely digital "cash", then one's tactics must change If de-empowering some aspects of the State is your goal, a new constrant is that your methods must not rely on anyone giving a crap about your goals, or possibly of digital cash. This does not mean that these ideas are destined to flounder, but instead it may mean that for them to have life they must find it somewhere where people can understand their usefulness. For instance, I can easily see some notions of untraceable digital cash finding applications over certain kinds of P2P networks. But if you continue to discuss the issue in the abstract, or purely in the context of de-stating the state, the youngins won't pay attention long enough for them to recognize why this may be useful to them. Eventually, however, they'll find the need for these ideas and do their homework.

No doubt if this movement gets big enough to basically become a religion (like everything in the US) then this will start to happen.
But fixing the conditions at 3rd world sweatshops will have very little impact to the cost of those goods. What's being discussed are things like ensuring that toxic gasses are not being spewed into the workplace (China), or moving workers towards a living wage (Haiti), or workers actually getting paid for the agreed upon wages (New York City). Right now the issue of 3rd world sweatshops has very little to do with economics per se.
The unfortunate thing, however, may be that international Marxist groups will make addressing these issues a priority (at least in terms of their rhetoric). And even though the Marxists will in the long run probably make conditions even worse, the failure to address these issues now may empower Marxists throughout certain parts of the world. Hell...if I found a local factory was regularly grinding up children in the machinery, I'd probably go and take up arms with them (or pay to have weapons drop-shipped to them). Of course, I'm thinking Sr Donald and other knee-jerkers will equate that with being a Marxist. But I do believe it is encumbant upon us capital-ists to address these issues before the system as a whole gets tossed out, at least for a while.

@_subject: Important: P2P+VOIP 
This article appeared in the Lightreading telecom site. Although fairly speculative, the mere implications of VoIP over P2P should be of much interest to Cypherpunks, perhaps the least importance being encryption.
Ever since KaZaA, founder Niklas Zennstrom let it slip in a Boardwatch interview that he was planning to launch a company offering voice services using peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols, Light Reading and Boardwatch have been puzzling over what he meant.
As Zennstrom himself has clammed up, speculation is in order. And our best guess is that he might be onto something REALLY BIG. Think bigger than Google. Think of something equivalent to the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) that would act as a distributed, dynamic, global telephone directory, linking users with whatever IP address their appliance happened to be using at the moment.
This addresses one of the big obstacles in the development of voice over IP (VOIP), and it might also unlock other breakthroughs. For instance, it could speed up the convergence of fixed and mobile telephony -- reckoned by Neil Ransom, CTO of Alcatel SA (NYSE: ALA - message board; Paris: CGEP:PA), to be the next big thing in telecom (look for the coming Light Reading interview).
It would be fairly straightforward to use P2P protocols to create such a distributed, global telephone directory, according to Geoff Bennett, director of Light Reading University, who happens to be moderating a Light Reading Webinar titled "Controlling P2P: Who's Stealing Your Bandwidth?" today, at 2:00 p.m. New York time. (Click here to register for the free, live broadcast.)
With P2P, a user could search a directory using a special browser and then click on the name he or she wanted to call. The client software would send the request to the equivalent of a KaZaA supernode that would search a giant routing table listing users and their current IP addresses, and send back the result to the client so the VOIP call could be set up.
This is pretty much how file sharing works, and file sharing clearly scales to the millions of users that might take advantage of such a system. Zennstrom estimates that 100 million people already use P2P protocols, and the KaZaA browser software has been downloaded a staggering 250 million times -- an order of magnitude more than anything else on CNET's download There are good reasons to believe that a P2P-based phone directory of this sort might work better than the VOIP solutions being cooked up by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
The IETF has various projects in this area, but they're all based on the fundamental philosophy that existing technology -- namely DNS -- should be adapted to deal with new requirements, rather than inventing something new.
But the new requirements in this case include more than just the IETF's Telephone Number Mapping (enum) project.
The IETF has also got to come up with a way of making DNS more dynamic, so that when a user moves from one IP address to another, he or she isn't cut off from the world while the changes propagate through the DNS hierarchy. When Boardwatch changed IP address earlier this year, a lot of readers were cut off for two or three days. Imagine the same thing happening every time someone shifted from a fixed to a mobile appliance!
Then there's the issue of reliability. Concerns are often expressed about the security of DNS -- in particular, its vulnerability to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. A P2P approach promises to be much more reliable, because it's so distributed and because the protocol has been designed to allow for parts of the network going AWOL unexpectedly.
"Historically, the issue with proprietary solutions has been lack of scaleability, and how robust they are in large networks," Bennett notes. "But P2P apps like KaZaA have shown they can scale and have amazing resilience because they're so distributed. How do you make a DOS attack on something that big?
"The P2P solution will obviously be proprietary, and it's always quicker to get a proprietary solution to market than to wait for consensus in a standards group -- especially about something as institutionalized as DNS."
For more on IETF side of the story, check out the following columns by Geoff Huston, a member of the Internet Architecture Board, the IETF steering body:
Lord of the Numbers
Who are You?
Light Reading is rather hoping that this speculation will encourage Zennstrom to spill the beans on what he's up to. Right now, we think we've only got half the story. The other half concerns SIP -- the Session Initiation Protocol -- seen by some as another catalyst for a VOIP explosion. In the Boardwatch interview Zennstrom slapped down the idea that his project had anything to do with SIP. Which leads us to ask: Why was he so adamant?

"Landline signals are vastly harder to pick up, and I doubt strongly that every minorly-radiating landline signal is being picked up."
Of course, optical signals could never be remotely detected by air or even without an optical tap. I doubt even aerial optical cable readiates enough or in such a way as to be remotely detectable.
However, the vast majority of "last mile" installations are still copper, and copper does radiate. But I can't see how that could be detected by air either. Even if there's enough radiation, it's going to get scattered and diffracted to hell and gone as it passes through the sheath, concrete, and then air.
ANd of course, there's the bandwidth issue. In even a medium sized metro area the sheer number of landlines will be huge, and any businesses will be shipping out their traffic via T1 or fractional T1. Hence, one of those airplanes would practically need a small CO to demultiplex all that traffic (although even off-the-shelf silicon has come a LONG way from the 5ESS days, so the size factor will not be something to sneeze at).
Nah. Any such AWAC-type recon 'surveys' must be seeking out targeted information somehow. Perhaps there's some kind of electronic 'red dye' that allow a specific set of users' calls to stand out? Is it possible that 'interesting' landlines are dropped-and-continued on to some narrowcasting point for air? This might be their way of getting around the TIRKS and provisioning issues related to moving those lines a long distance, and possibly through multiple carriers (but then again, that just might be what DISAs' recently announced GIG-BE network is supposed to solve!)

I'm wondering if some of those lod satellite links or other technologies might not actually be used precisely for dumping a "dragnet" over to HQ for sifting. In face, didn't the government buy the old Iridium network?
What probably happens is that the government sends some commands into the PSTN (via that "emergency" channel) that drop-and-continue a TINY, carefully-selected fraction of a cities' traffic (probably pre-sifted using super-duper SAS analysis and whotnot), and then wirelessly transmits those calls to a series of sifters, the first several of which are probably computer-based, the last batch of which are human (probably a lot like a credit card operation).
However, it IS interesting to think about just what might fit into an AWAC or whatever these days, given 0.13 micron (or better...who knows?) ASICs. A single shelf of Cisco 15454 gear can pretty much do whatever you want to an OC-48, though you need more shelves in order to provide the COAX terminals for the DS1s encased therein.
Then again, in an AWAC they would have to send that OC-48 directly to some dedicated hardware to begin the winnowing process: looking for un provisioned lines, determining which lines have data, which voice, determinig which data is to/from ISPs,...etc...and then some SAS analysis to whittle it down to a small huntable set. Possibly an AWAC could handle several OC-48s provided there was some useful "hunting" criteria.
Hum. I think I'm convincing myself that an AWAC might actually be able to perform some interesting telecom reconaissance, depending on the application, but I'm fairly certain one of the functions is NOT to try to surreptitiously scan for radiation. Interesting traffic is almost certainly sent over to an uplink from somewhere in the ground.

Oh, I forgot their might be some other purpose for AWAC-type mapping of an urban area.
Although it's not too well known, McDonalds and other fast-food franchises actually have state-monitored radio-frequency 'beacons'. These beacons transmit at a special frequency that the brains of schizophrenics are very sensitive to, and that draws schizophrenics like flies. And if you've seen an inner-city McDonalds full of homeless and assorted schizos, its either because their transmitter has drifted out of spec, or they've deliberated boosted it up to increase sales.
So one purpose of those AWACs is obviously to map the fields of such transmitters. And its not the licensed ones they're worried about...imagine some 'terrorist' or other troublemaker getting one of those things and then cranking it up near some big political meeting, like G4 or whatever. (It's apparently happened on several occasions...apparently Woodstock was actually a pre-cmmmercial military test of the thing.)

20 years ago, I might have agreed with this assessment. Actually, written in the present tense it is largely true. 3,000 years ago is a different story, however, and modern religionists often forget that. The earliest religious texts (including the Torah) are written in such a 'primitive' time that I don't think any of the modern notions apply. For instance, in the Torah it would seem that there are clearly plenty of other Gods to choose from, but the one the jews were commanded to choose was  (Tetragrammaton). He doesn't even seem to have the qualities of "justice" righteousness, truth, peace, compassion blah blah blah that we are supposed to associate with God today. In fact, the Torah was written in the form of a peace treaty, with the implication that if the jews stopped obeying their end of the bargain, they'd get the CRAP kicked out of them. Period.
Likewise, the Vedas and the earliest portions of the I Ching come from a time that is probably incomprehensible now.
A reference to group theory, eh? Nice. The Jungians of the world might argue otherwise, that religion to some extent codified primitive forms of group theory into symbolism. Certainly, the Dzog Chen tibetan Buddhists did comething very close to this, visualizing n-dimensional arrays of 'dieties' which are considered really focal/fold points of "psychocosmic energy"*.
If you are referring to modern religion in the religious sense, I agree. But I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater...there are some very odd things tucked away into the Torah, for instance, that are arguably worth discovering. But then again, maybe I'm willing to throw the baby out with the bath water...if that water gets pooped up enough, the baby is no longer *: See "Psychocosmic Symbolism of the Buddhist Stupa" by Anagarika Govinda for an excellent discussion of buddhist iconography in the context of an architectural study.

As for the totalitarianism part,as long as you don't complain too loudly about the government, you're fine for the most part (particularly if you have lots of $$$). (Although every now and then Jong Nan Hai will decide to crack down on something and you may come under fire.)
If you want to call it "totalitarian", fine. But like all western terms applied to China, its relevance only has a very limited meaning.

Yeah, even if there's disagreements with some of the anti-public-smoking arguments, the general principals involved shouldn't be too hard to agree with. Basically, "don't try to kill me".
It gets easier when one remembers that cigarette smoke was inches away from being declared a "class A carcinogen", but the tobacco companies through much dinero into the debate.

So now replace a public smoker with a guy playing tossing around a big blob of asbestos, and watch various cypherpunks start taking out their shotguns.

I just think that's too grandiose a statement. In my particular case,
"People who use encryption technology to make interference in my personal communications impossible", where interference is defined as eavesdropping, jamming, "man-in-the-middle" and so on. In other words, an infinitely hard titanium pipe between me and who/whatever is on the other side.
As for the state, well, it may come or go as a result of secure communications. I suspect it will find a way to stick around. But if heavy crypto proliferates it will force it to change, at the very least.
But the state is secondary. If they get out of my way (or if by technology I push them out of the way) for the important stuff, fine.

That's about the right percentage.
Not really. This party line is equally hot air. Basically, there are two main modes of asbestos related disease: asbestosis and melothemeoma (I probably spelled that last one wrong.) The Manville miners inhaled huge quantities of Asbestos and almost all of them died of asbestosis. This can occur when exposed to any type of asbestos in large quantities.
Another form of asbestos-related death is a whole different story. Melothemeoma is due to when the non-serpentine types of asbestos pierce the lung wall and push stray genetic refuse into cell nuclei, starting a really bad lung cancer. The form of asbestos most closely associated with this is crocidilyte, which is needle-like and a beautiful dark blue in color. That form of asbestos can cause cancer even in very low exposures. Forunately, its exceedingly rare. Back in the late 80s I only saw perhaps half a dozen samples of it in the course of viewing many thousands of asbestos.
As for floor tiles using asbestos, I would never bother removing them...the asbestos in them probably mitigates far more fire-related danger than it causes exposure-related risk. As for hanging clumps of Asbestos down in your boiler room, close the door and don't let the kids play down there. Don't abate, as you'll probably create more exposure than if you left it alone.
Summary: your odds of dying due to low levels of asbestos exposure are exceedingly low, but decidedly nonzero.

Well, I'd say it's more complex than that. Until recently, the view in China towards minorities was that Minorities are fine and dandy as long as they don't exhibit traits that are too obviously non-Han while presenting a threat to Han-dominated areas. Now, it's more like "Hum...how can we turn a profit with these folks? Tourism? Manufacturing?"
Overall, the Chinese have never seemed to have the bloodlust that western countires had...they'd always prefer to absorb another culture rather than kill it outright.
And yes, while in China I tried to travel to Tibet with a Japanese buddhist monk, but Tibet was suddenly "closed" due to the 80s riots in Lhasa (and look on a map...that's a LARGE area to simply declare "closed", but it was fairly enforceable due to the few viable routes into Tibet).
IN addition, in 1988 there were many cities closed to foriegners. But that's mostly all gone now, as joint foerign-market-oriented factories proliferate in more and more parts of China. Right now, you'd have to say that China was fairly "free" from an economic standpoint, and not free politically, with all other areas somewhere in between.

The church morphed, changed, fought itself and the rest of the world and found a nice cozy niche for itself.
ANd part of this is due to mere social inertia... but also, the church probably still serves a function that people need (or at least want), and so they continue to feed it $$$ and whatnot. But the Catholic church has become one possible option, and arguably they've learned to "compete" for donations and members.
Likewise with governments. I still need my trash taken out, and for potholes to be fixed. And although these services can be provided privately (maybe) if strong crypto gives people opportunities, government might be forced to learn how to do some things more efficiently so that people can "opt-in" if they choose to. Hell, this has already happened to some extent with the US mail service.
So while I don't believe heavy crypto will kill off governments, I DO believe it will eventually force them to change into something we probably can't imagine too well right now.

I think you're overstating things here. The Manville settlements (which forced Manville into Ch13, as I remember) were jury awarded and to date comprise the lion's share of settlement $$$. And in those cases the harm was no exactly witchcraft-like: only a a few (literally 3 or 4) of the miners were left alive to collect. The rest had died of asbestosis.
As for abating the NYC public schools, that was a giant boondoggle that benefited many corrupt parties in NYC (I could go into great detail, but that would make it too easy to locate me in meatspace).

"We have a few here in Santa Cruz. Bums and winos make a token effort to stand around and rake. Mostly it's an excuse for community money to be handed out to the "farmers." I've also walked past the weed-choked community garden in Berkeley, on the site of "People's Park," IIRC. Skanks and bums. New slogan for these urban community gardens: "Hoes fo da hoes!"
Life in NYC is radically different and, I trhink, poses some interesting questions to purer libertarians.
In NYC there are many community gardens in poorer neighborhoods. These community gardens receive no meny from either state or city governments, and occur on lots that have been abandoned for (sometimes) decades. In many cases the lot has come under the technical ownership of the city, which left the lot basically a field of bricks and illegally dumped garbage, which the locals transformed into a thing of relative beauty..
Recently, for the purposes of building low-income housing, the city has decvided to bulldoze some of these gardens, which the locals have put a lot of sweat into over the years.  Needless to say, the locals don't want their garden bulldozed and, despite the fact that they are often of very low income themselves, don't want additional housing built on the garden's lot. However, the cost of buying the land is normaly well beyond the reach of even a large group of such locals (though a couple of years ago there was a move among some celebs to buy up the land and donate it to the community, but I think that only occured in Manhattan.)
So, one could make he argument that "they should have found private property to make their garden", but this misses the point that part of the purpose of the garden is to greatly increase the visual livability of the neighborhood. (Also, these people simply could not afford to buy up such land.) And now, after creating a nice space in those lots for so many years the city wants to bulldoze them. Should thery be allowed to do so? Should the city be forced to sign over such land to the locals for them to "own"? Or should active resistance be utilized tostop the bulldozers? (Or is bulldozing the right thing to do?)
I really don't know the answer. Anyone care to comment?

Hey...I had a great idea today. So great that all will be forced to bow at the feet of Tyler Durden.
Of course, I have a decent amount beer in me, and there are unresolved issues, but right now it's lookin' pretty "obvious" so here goes.
Kids who currently share files via P2P should instead "earn" song download credits by making their computers available for grid computing.
Comments? First let me state what I don't give a crap about...
1) Market for grid computing. For argument sake, let's assume it's there, and that there will increasingly exist compaines that need supercomputing-like capabilities but don't want to buy a Cray or whatever.
2) Kids won't bother. Bullshit. There will certainly exist a % of teenagers that would rather "legitimately" earn song downloads, and who have an "always on" broadband pipe. As for CPUs, those will otherwise be wasted at And in case I gotta explain it for the dim-witted, I'm talking about a big company wishing to purchase grid-computing facilities who come to the "P2P Grid Corp", and pay some $$$. These $$$ are then actually paid in part to entertainment companies for the rights to allow subscribers to download files in exchange for making their CPUs available for grid computing.
Of course there are open questions. Like, how to value a CPU? (Hettinga?) Also, it would seem to me this system needs to be centralized, in order to control the file sharing. But it also occurs to me that a "song" might actually in itself act as a digibuck of sorts within the system (imagine...the 'gold' doesn't sit in a bank, it's actually encoded into the digibuck itself!) (There's also the issue of how to value the pipe-size into that PC's home...a big FAT-ASS computer within a tiny little 56K pipe might not be super valuable)...

In NYC the phenomenon is entirely different. First of all, the gardens are almost always gated and barbwired.

FREMONT, Calif. -- In the wake of its quarterly meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona last week, the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) announced approval of the Security Extension for the User-to-Network Interface (UNI) and Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) Implementation Agreement (IA). The IA is the result of the combined efforts of the OIF's Architecture Working Group (WG), Carrier WG, Signaling WG and Operations Administration, Maintenance, & Provisioning (OAM&P) WG. The IA focuses on security for management interfaces and the auditing and logging of optical transport network elements.
"Work on this implementation agreement began by identifying carriers' security requirements and then evaluating alternative solutions," said Joe Berthold, CIENA Corporation, president of the OIF. "The Security Extension IA is an example of multiple OIF working groups collaborating to better the The Security IA defines a common extension for securing the protocols used in the UNI 1.0 IA and the UNI 2.0 and NNI works in progress. The IA was written to provide a common set of security mechanisms required to protect the signaling and routing of optical connections. These mechanisms safeguard transport networks against attacks that may compromise their control planes, seek unauthorized use of their resources or attempt to gain unauthorized information about their configuration and usage. To counter these threats, the IA was developed to protect the UNI signaling control channel(s). The Security Extension IA provides options for more extended coverage, defines a common method to secure additional protocols, allows compatibility between UNI and NNI security and reduces the need for manual intervention. The IA defines an optional-to-implement profile of the IETF's IPsec so signaling protocols that can be protected with mutual authentication, key management, message integrity, replay detection and confidentiality in a standard, widely-implemented, interoperable manner.

I guess there aren't many (currently) pot-smkoing persons on this list.
Apparently, pot is the number 2 cash crop in the US, after soy.
As a result of Reagun era "war on drugs", pot-growers moved indoors and also in the process created new monster breeds of reefer that render the best hash we had in the 70s "lemonade".
There was a fascinating NY Times article in the mid-90s in the subject.
Apparently, some counties in the deep south have tossed out elected sherrifs that were hostile to pot growers and installed "friendlier" ones. Look for counties were pot busts went from X to zero in a short time.
Actually, there are some technologies used by some pot growers that are probably of interest to Cypherpunks. Apparently, Route 95 is now famous for growers who move up and down between states to their various grow-locations, each one without enough pot to merit long term jail time. If one of the locations are entered, the most sophisticated growers are alerted electronically, and never return to tha location again. One wonders what cryptographic protocols are being used by said growers, and whether growers are able to use them properly.

So you make your server regularly go get random webpages so that your customers have a cloak of privacy, and this is what you tell the court. (Provided, of course, they have some way to 'prove' that the traffic into and out of your server is fake traffic!) In these kinds of scenarios, 'realistic' web traffic might be unneccessary.

Also watch carefully for hole-pokers...I'd bet their's also been disinfo campaigns to get the public to think that no crypto is secure (every ask anyone if they believed there was such a thing as effectively 'unbreakable' encryption?

"Basically they say things like "If you think the government can't break all

Basically, the answer was hinted at by another poster.
For anyone who doesn't trust the government, the point to make is that crypto use is currently a red flag. Last year I went through great pains on this list to point out that right now the gubmint probably doesn't even need to break most encrypted messages in order to know something's up. This is only possible because outside of a coporate context few individuals use If everybody uses encryption, then it matters MUCH less if the government can break any one message. What costs us pennies to encrypt may cost them thousands to break. That's the assymmetry we asyms can exploit. That's where we need to depart from a Tim May lone wolf approach to your friendly, smiling America-loving flag-waving cypherpunks: "If you don't use encryption then you help the terrorists win".
This statement has the added irony of being objectively true, according to more international definitions of 'terrorism'.

If crypto is rarely used, then MY usage of it is actually almost worse (depending on context) than using it. More than that, increased use of crypto implies increased cost of monitoring. The $$$ nature of the assymmetry is mirrored precisely by the calculational assymetry. Ideally, it seems to me that this should be exploited.
"If only everyone" is I agree largely pointless in and of itself. However, when coupled to some fairly easy and obvious applications of "greed", the potential results are interesting. Want an example?
We now see file trading, messaging, and possibly even IP telephony occuring in P2P networks. Some of the P2Ps will be/are encrypted...a primitive form of "blacknet" you might say. Couple this app with popular notions of "protecting us from the terrorists" and you may have wildfire. That's the goal: wildfire.
You're problem is that you don't realize that crypto is no longer a technological issue now. It's now a social and marketing one. The fact that "Tyler Durden" actually has little of major insight to say completely misses the point. Ideally, "Tyler Durden" is a generic, popular figure that embodies virulent, 'stoopid' popularity. Tyler Durden is not an intellectual: He's basically a dumb punk and a rabblerouser.

I think that it's becomming clear that in order for Americans to feel safe US troops should morph into an international Police force.

The container was shipped to Los Angeles in late July, just one week before the bombing of the Jakarta Marriott Hotel that killed 12 people.
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge has claimed major improvements in port security, in part because of enhanced vigilance overseas. "So that our borders become the last line of defense, not our first line of defense," Ridge said in a speech last week. He said the United States was increasing security "thousands of miles away, long before a container is first loaded on a ship."
But in Jakarta, ABCNEWS producers David Scott and Rhonda Schwartz found that the chest in which they had placed the depleted uranium was never opened or inspected before being sent on to Los Angeles. "

Walked by an interesting protest outside the stock exchange last week.
In the "pen" in front were probably no more than 600 people attending a protest against the well-named "Patriot Act", and against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their policies.
WHat was interesting was that, despite the relatively small numbers (I've seen crowds 5 times that size allowed for other stuff), police were not letting anyone into the area without an ID of some kind....I heard them saying there was already "too many people there". (And by "area" I mean from Broadway east, one block north of Wall South, and I don't know where the other borders were...I'd bet someone who knew the area could probably find a route in, but you'd have to get up through those wierd SE streets like "Beaver" and so on.
A form of censorship? Definitely...like I've said...I've seen LOTS more people allowed for other stuff (even Nader). There was plenty of room even in the pen (Broad Street has been closed in front of the stock exchange since 9/11/01...there's a series of barracades.)
Now obviously, the "authorities" would probably claim (if push came to shove) that this particular group posed a greater risk than other groups. (Or in NYC, depending on who was asking, they'd probably cite some specific laws that pointed to their right to 'cap' the event at the levels it was attended at at the time, and deny this group was being given special Anyone see this on the news? I don't remember any major news trucks out there...I wonder if their quote somehow excluded them also, assuming they'd be interested (and they might be, if the numbers were much larger).
So...an interesting strategy:
A big anti-government rally is planned.
Cops show up early and deliberately make large numbers impossible.
News folks (already pre-disposed not to cover such an event) find even more reason not to be interested given the small numbers.

I guess in the end we are responsible for the actions our government takes. And if we remain ignorant and continue to benefit (and do nothing to stop it), then we are responsible, particularly when our military represents an outrageously assymetric invasionary force.

Got a crypto question here.
Let's say I push out a list I'd like to keep secret to some client machine. The user of that machine must enter some ID or other piece of information. I want the client machine to perform a search of that ID vs the contents of a list (again, resident locally on that machine), but I don't want the user to be able to see the other entries of that list.
Possible? Remember, after the initial push of data out to the client machine, no more messages are exchanged. This means the list must be sent in encrypted form.
When the search is performed, the "stupid" thing to do (I think...someone correct me) is to take the user's ID, encrypt it, and then determine if matches an encypted member of the list (and I don't see encrypted each entry individually as a desirable thing). I am assuming that this allows a savvy user to reverse-engineer the encryption.
Another option is one I don't have the background at this stage to understand. Let's assume the entire list has been encrypted in one shot. Is there some function such that when this encrypted list is convolved with the user ID a "Yes" or "no" can be obtained (indicating presence or absence from the list)?
If the answer is yes, I'd also like to know if knowing this is farily basic to most encryption professionals sphere of knowledge...

"The pre-microprocessor
automation of telephony (pulse and then touchtone dialing) put
expensive automation at the top of the hierarchy, and, as costs fell,
moved down from there."
Well, from the little I can understand of what you're saying, there seems to be some stuff worthy of at least cursory consideration there. However, the analogy to switching systems is a little off.
For one, a telephony switch isn't really something that can be measured on one axis (ie, throughput). There are two (or perhaps 3) axes that really describe the family of telephony switches: throughput and granularity. Back in my telecom days I used to joke that "In my pocket I have a switch matrix capable of 100 Terabits of throughput"...whereupon I'd whip out a (fiber) jumper, and point out that this jumper could "switch" 100Tb "from this port to this port". (This is an exageration of claims made about the throughput of OXCs, or optical cross connects.)
This is important because it is indicative of the fact that there is no hierarchy of switches as you describe in a telephony switch. A Broadband DCS doesn't somehow control the network. In fact, you could argue that the 'little' 5ESS switches out on the edge ultimately control the network, though even that would be inaccurate.
No, the entire phone network is "governed" externally by an OSS. I don't really see how this is describable by a hierarchy per se, and certainly not a hierarchy that can somehow be traced to a linear measure of switching As for the tem "geodesic", I have to admit it's cool sounding in this FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar  get it now!

Actually, to some extent I did realize this, though I couldn't resist the droll troll urge.
And of course, perpetual storage isn't really any kind of end-goal itself...the 'goal' of course is to be able to securely store and move information without fear (or the possibility due to anonymity) of reprisal, if that is so desired.
(As an aside, although debt has to be -forgiven- after 7 years, contrary to popular belief it is not true that a debt has to be -forgotten-...I know of one credit major card company that will not accept 'new' cardmembers that didn't pay back what they owed, even if that's 15 years ago. That's actually perfectly legal.)
That said, I guess the dude does have an interesting point under all that stuff, after all. That point being that (most likely) free email capabilities may in some cases become like the now-defunct lockers in Grand Central Station...a place where "stuff" can be stored securely, and access granted at will. The key feature (as you point out) isn't so much the storage capacity (although the increasing size of such capacity makes this a more and more attractive option), but the google search feature.
OK, point conceded (once I tore off the wrapper).

Someone enlighten me here...I don't see this as obvious. I might certainly be willing to pay to route someone else's message if I understand that to be the real cost of mesh connectivity. In other words, say I'm driving down the FDR receiving telemetry about the road conditions downtown of me by a few miles. If I'm a router, I'm also sending that info behind me (which is routing I'm paying for basically), but I will understand that the reason I am getting my telemetry is precisely because there's a string of "me's" in the cars in front of me, routing info down to me. If I insist on getting paid, so will they, and the whole thing breaks down.
Actually, this reminds me of the prisoner's dilemma. I remember (I think) Hofstaedter doing an interesting analysis that showed that smart 'criminals' will eventually realize that it pays to cooperate, even if that doesn't optimise one's chances in this particular instance.
Of course, the battery lifetime acts as the "weighting" factor here...if only a small % of the traffic I'm routing belongs to me, then I may not be so willing to route it if my battery lifetime is short. As battery time lifetime increases however (though this sorely lags behind Moore's law) then more and more people will be willing to route.

Well, this is not well understood by those outside the credit world.
What the law actually states is (basically) a defaulted loan must be forgiven after seven years. In other words, it is illegal to continue to attempt to collect on a loan, 7 years after the default.
However, it is perfectly legal to remember that an individual failed to pay back a loan. In practice, this means that a large brand-name Credit Card company can choose not to send an offer to someone that defaulted 10 years ago. Of course, they can't dunn that person anymore, but they don't have to offer a card. I know without any doubt that there is at least one that does this, and it's not like the Feds wouldn't notice!
Well, in a lot of cases I agreed with May's sentiment, even if I'm not entirely sure this would do much. However, as for putting the Jews and blacks up chimneys, well add to that what appears to be an almost State Corporatism stance, and there's a discernable vector there...look up "Boehrman Flight Capital Organization" and I'm still not convinced the resemblance is coincidental.
But those are side issues. At least, aside from the technical content, I still view May's harshest rantings as a sort of Fredom of Speech acid test...if one would try to forcibly or legally shut him down, then one probably "needs killing".

Well, as usual I don't think I'm understanding you here. In my example I'm imagining I'm a livery cab driver or something. In that case, instantaneous micro-traffic-conditions can be very valuable in NYC.
In that environment, a cabbie will quickly understand that the network will collapse if all of the wireless nodes act to conserve power by not re-transmitting information. So even though it costs you something to route a packet you yourself will not use, if you're even reasonably smart you'll pass some on until you're nearing your batteries exhaustion, then perhaps go into a listening mode.
(And of course, it may easily be possible to form spontaneous VLANs that deal only with traffic, and then only route those packets...but that doesn't change my argument any.)

"Meshing may not be free.  I think we agree."
Well, parts of it will not be free. However, I still think that even though routing someone else's packets does not benefit me directly, it is this activity which gives rise to the mesh. I guess, "do unto others..." P2P is basically the same...remember, in the simplest versions there was never any need to make content available. However, P2P-ers seemed to innately understand that P2P won't really be possible unless one is a source as well as a sink.
In the WiFi version it'll be easy to start to "triage" certain kinds of activity as battery power runs thin...first, a throttle down to only routing packets of a certain application (or VLAN or whatever). (This actually does make sense because it eats a hell of a lot more battery power transmitting a packet than receiving it.) Second, when the battery is within X minutes of dying then only listening and not transmitting.
But I think my main point holds: even 'reglar' folks will realize that there's a "gobal" benefit to routing someone else's packets, even if that does eat into remaining battery time.

"When faced with force, you reply with force when you can."
Nah. This isn't even true in a fistfight, except when the guy you're fighting is a) significantly smaller than you, and b) less trained. More often than not, if someone attacks you, it's because they either have or perceive themselves to have an overwhelmingly superior force. In such a situation it's often best to run. Barring that, then "soft" methods are by far the best alternative, but soft methods normally require intelligence, or at least the ability to utilize an opponent's force against him (I think I can unequivocally state that I have had the opportunity to test such a principal here on the streets of NYC). And of course, if it's possible to diarm your opponent without actually killing or maiming him, that's sometimes far more appropriate...reference 'Aikido' and remember the unmasked "MasterBlaster". Every once in a while, somebody makes a mistake they eventually regret.
As someone said better than myself, Crypto is one little tool in an aresenal against "Men with Guns"...in the end Men With Guns will probably try to shoot away bits, but it's not going to work too well.

My point was (and sometimes is) that our beliefs about Economics, capitalism, and politics are to some extent irrelevant in the light of a techno-determinist point of view (Riad Wahbi pointed this out a few posts ago). In that context, raising some questions about some of the accepted notions about capitalism wasn't (for me at least) necessarily an attempt to "fight" the crypto-anarchic view/goal/partyline May seemed bent on establishing, but rather to suggest that even groups or individuals with ostenibly very different goals might be able to embrace a crypto-approach towards achieving their aims. In other words, it should be considered a good thing if leftists or liberals or Jihadists utilize well-formed crypto...that can actually only accelerate whatever's down the pike. And opening the discussions up a bit for such not only keeps away the philosophical inbreeding of some lists, it might actually start something amongst adherents of that point of view.
And hell, if there's a way to maintain a left-wing stance without that eventually resulting in me having to put in 14 hour days in People's Shoe Factory Number 14, then more power to 'em....I think it's probably too late even for some 21st Century hyper-Stalin to sieze control of both wireline and wireless internet now... but again, who gives a crap.

He's not wrong, he's merely kinda confused on this issue. Any big link (T1/DS1/DS3/STS-3c...) into an ISP provided by the telecom service provider is almost certainly protected via SONET. SONET architectures can provide various forms of protection (not all utilize redudant compies of the data...UPSR and Linear 1+1 do, BLSR is different).
Of course, the router does not see that redundancy and can not make use of it. The multiple links that do exist (each of which protected behind the scenes by the telecom service provider) can be utilized by the router. If one of those links goes down (perhaps it was unprotected "extra traffic" in a BLSR and there was a fiber cut), the router will just send the stuff through the other link.

Well, there's no doubt that what Variola says is basically correct.
But it doesn't exactly apply to the specific situation I was referring to, which was whether something "inconspicuous" might be slipped into a CO unbeknownst to the rank-and-file (ie, the CO manager would probably receive some kind of order saying there'd be a special installation one day..."just leave those guys alone and don't worry about the little box they're putting in...it just measures traffic is all"). But the kind of iron that would be needed to unpackage and then pull out and record pretty much "everything" would still be a huge, power-hungry beast with mutliple racks and cards. Why do I say this? Well...
When I spoke of 0.13um technology, my thought had nothing to do with the yield, but merely with the size/power of the device. Examination of current off-the-shelf chip architectures (and network processors are still a couple of years behind the ASICs) indicates that, unless a LOT of chips in that range are used, they wouldn't be able to do the above.
This means they've got to do all this unpacking in some kind of central location (ie, not a CO), where I do believe what Variola speaks of is possible. BUT, they've got to get it all there. This means they'd either have to put in tons of lasers and gear (essentially creating a 1:1 copy of the current transport network), or else CALEA the most likely batches of traffic and then send it back. They probably WANT to get it all (GIG-BE, anyone?) but they simply don't have the gear nor power nor footprint available to them. If nothing else, it would be hugely conspicious. There'd be no way to hide it from the craft, nor from the rest of the world (all that gear would need a big army of secret craftpersons).
This leads me back to burst mode. I'm sure there are many uses for burst mode, but I'd also bet this is one of the drivers. It's probably worth examining whether they're putting a lot of money into signaling. Look for unheard of startups as paying members of OIF and the GMPLS fora.
No, the NSA is probably generations ahead in some areas, but their fabs aren't much better than what's available commercially.

Unlike more hard-line cypherpunks, I'm not (yet) convinced that government-originated laws are an inherent evil, even when I don't agree with them. The main problem comes when administration of these laws pretty much boils down to the whim of a local "authority". In this case the traveler didn't "look" like a terrorist, so he was OK. If the very same guy attempted this same procedure on the very next day, though wearing a "Stop Bush" shirt, I'd bet any amount of money he'd be denied the right to fly. So what it all boils down to is the personal whim of the law "enforcement" official, who at best is corrupt and at worst stupid and incompetant.

A nice little rant, I must say.
BUT...there are some interesting undertones here. First and foremost, I see no mention of JYA being an 'anarchist', and indeed there's a slightly positive spin given to his efforts. The first (and lesser) implication of this is that NYT and its employees are smart enough after 9/11 to realize that their continued physical survival will depend on being fairly practical. A "don't look over here" approach didn't work before, and it won't work now.
More than that, it may indicate that the business managers at major media are starting to realize that they can't continue pissing off huge chunks of the public and still sell papers, etc.... Note the move from "Iraqi terrorists" to "Iraqi insurgents". Wait for them to start calling al-Sadr "hardline" rather than "Radical".

@_subject: Jewish wholy words.. 
The idea of Jewish "Scripture" is far more complex than can be described in a short amount of time.
Clearly, the Torah is far more important than anything, even the other books of the "Old Testament" (for Jews the Old testament is actually in 3 or 4 books). The Torah is the only piece of Jewish scripture said to be dictated letter-by-letter to Moses.
Now there are several "rings" of lesser works concentric around the Torah, including the Talmud and the Mishra and then a couple of dozens of centuries of other stuff. The Talmud is often called the "Oral Torah", but even this designates a slightly inferior status, being the written version of words originally spoken by Moses. The Mishnah are not scriptures at all, technically, though they can be given great reverence depending on the Rabbi that wrote/spoke a particular section.
Contrast that to the Protestant notion of Go/NoGo for scriptures...we don't even have the Apocryhpa anymore, despite the fact that Martin Luther had it in his Bible and quoted from it. It's eaither divinely inspired or it ain't...a simplisitic idea that probably helped spread Protestantism to the poor and uneducated.
In short, it's silly to somehow get on the Jews for something that shows up in some commentary written 20 centuries ago (eg, Baylonian Talmud).

(I assume the answer is 'no'...they'll be smart enough at least to recognize that this was something around for a while that they were unaware of).
NSA folks, on the other hand, I would assume have a soft version of a Variola Stego suitcase...able to quickly detect the presence of pretty much any kind of stego and then perform some tests to determine what kind was used. I bet they've been aware of Al Qaeda stego for a long time...that's probably the kind of thing they are very very good at.
In the end it probably comes down to Arabic, however, and that language has many built-in ways of deflecting the uninitiated. I'd bet even NSA has a hard time understanding an Arabic language message, even after they de-stego and translate it.

Well, the first thing to remember is that Arabic more or less has a built-in method for distributing covert information...kind of like Hebrew, an Arabic word can be viewed in terms of a subset of consonants...for specific groupings there are lots of well-known associated words with the same letters. I'd bet a careful examination of bin Laden communiques will reveal the existence of pointers to such special words...the initated will know how to pull out those words and use them as passwords, etc...
As for the sophistication of Al Qaeda software, remember we're probably not talking about a very centrally-organized group. Their members are scattered in all sorts of socio-eco-bandwidth environments so that off-the-shelf (where shelf=internet) stuff is going to be common.
Remember too that broad categories of Stego can apparently be detected by FFT (someone here posted a link to a paper describing that). Put that and all sorts of other routines looking for specific Stego signatures inot a Variola suitcase and I bet they (NSA, though not police) can pull out practically anything they want to. BUT...that probably doesn't do them a ton of good...the plaintext will be in Arabic, it will speak symbolically, and maybe use some even more clever techniques for info obfscuration.
As for the 'semaphore' theory I consider that likely...lots of info will be sent out-of-band (ie, verbally) and Stego'd info will perhaps be triggers or possibly meeting coordinates. Maybe an account number every now and then (VERY easy to hide using Arabic letter-numerals).

Oh no, it gets really interesting. He claims to be an ex-German TLA-type (how many Ls do German TLAs normally have?), and had advanced knowledge of 9/11. That's not super-implausible.
What's really interesting is that he claims the German TLAs have a new round of strong evidence showing that there's a nuke buried in Houston somewhere that's going to be set off on 12/27. He's tied in all sorts of shadowy agencies along with internal politcs causing the info not to be acted upon.
Even that would be worthy of ignoring, but he's actually told this story extremely well, naming fairly obscure (but real) names in the intelligence community and so on. The guy's posts have actually made some serious waves on a bunch of boards.
Me? I suspect he just pulled all this shit from David Emory's shows and then added some nice google tech searches. WiFi I know was cracked wide open a while back, and that wasn't exactly a secret (it's the reason for 802.11x). BUT, add knowledge of this to the conspiracy theories to the politics and you have a guy who has gone to great lengths to create an excellent hoax. Indeed, one can only imagine that the reason for something like this has to go way beyond mere hoaxing (eg, the guy's a neo-Nazi?)
I was hoping someone knew about this and had already hacked this hoax, because so far I haven't seen anything that conclusively debunks this guy.

No way it's Dave Emory...they did an IP Traceroute and the guy appears to be in Germany. If you've listened to Emory's shows, you'd know from some of his technical statements that he most likely wouldn't be capable of this. I also simply can't imagine him bothering with something like this.
On the other hand, the perpetrator of this hoax knows a decent amount about a variety of subjects (including technical ones). After sleeping on it, I'm starting to think he's actually some kind of German conspiracy 'theorist' who's actually been snooping the WiFi, etc...of some interesting locations. He probably saw a "pattern" and convinced himself he had to save the world.
It's a very interesting thread to say the least. Forget whether Paul Wolfowitz has some "Hidden Hand" master plan...it'll probably make Dis-information History one day.

If they can spend a couple of bucks to flush out a list rather than mount some major operation that's what they'll do, if for no other reason than to keep their exposure down.

Isn't that almost like saying "simply splice into the undersea cable"? Of course, if we're talking about hunting down Osama bin Laden a TLA (or whoever) would probably do that. But in terms of merely rounding up the names of potential trouble makers (particularly when they don't want anyone to know that they're doing this) it seems to be an awfully easy thing to do.
As for the fake virus part, all they need to do is go to some year-old virus list, select a virus, and send one directly through a non-de-mimed list server, and then watch what comes out. Seems a lot cheaper and easier.
But this misses the point: Even IF this would be "stupid", it would be stupider still to be aware that this is possible, and then not implement a fix (if a cheap fix is available). De-miming is now obvious.

This came out on lightreading.com. Seems there's one tiny step backward for CALEA w.r.t Internet telephony. I guess it's obvious the FBI will eventually get it's way, but it's be interesting to see how it goes about it from here At its open meeting today, the FCC took a couple of baby steps toward providing regulatory clarity on Internet telephony.
The first big decision was a victory for VOIP proponents. The commission ruled that Pulver.com's Free World Dialup VOIP service is an information service, not a telecommunications service. The decision was based largely on the analysis that it doesn!/t fit the 1996 Telecom Act!/s definition of a telecommunications service.
!0There is no question that this doesn!/t constitute a telecommunications service,!1 said commissioner Kathleen Abernathy. !0It falls squarely outside that statutory definition.!1
That analysis was shared by commissioner Jonathan Adelstein: !0Pulver.com!/s service is largely unregulated today and, in my view, should stay that Commissioner Michael Copps dissented amid concerns that the FCC hadn!/t fully considered the implications, particularly for law enforcement, universal service, and public safety. !0I!/m afraid we!/re leaping before we!/re looking,!1 he said. !0This rush to reclassify will lead us down a road where we!/re compelled to engage in legal calisthenics and contortion of both CALEA and the 1996 Telecom Act to meet our statutory obligations. This is admittedly an important decision, but not so important that it cannot wait a little while longer while we conduct an expeditious review.!1
That review is coming. After the vote on Free World Dialup, the commission initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Internet telephony (see  Although the commission is starting from the premise that VOIP should be subject to minimal regulation, it still has to clarify issues such as wiretaps and whether Internet telephony is an intrastate or interstate However, there are two reasons to believe that the FCC won!/t issue an Order on VOIP until late 2004 -- if then. First, the commission historically doesn!/t undertake major policy initiatives in a Presidential election year. Second, Internet telephony is such a complex issue with such far-reaching implications that it!/s difficult to see how it could be resolved to everyone!/s satisfaction, let alone in one fell swoop.
One thing is clear: The commission believes that federal regulators, not states, should set VOIP regulations. The NPRM is an opportunity to avoid a patchwork of rules across the country, Abernathy says. Nevertheless, completely preempting state authority likely would send Internet telephony to the courts, prolonging uncertainty.

Well, yeah...there's been a lot of good to come out of the Christian world, including the notion of "unalienable human rights".
But it's a worthwhile topic to troll about for a while. If you make a calculation of the number of humans made miserable by greater Christendom (to use a Kierkegaardian term), it probably dwarfs a similar calculation made for other religions, including Stalinism. On the other hand, the Christians learned how to make precise-bore gunpowder weapons earlier than anyone else, so maybe it's just an historic accident.
However, fundamentalist forms of Christianity seem to be at the heart of a lot of this Administration's shenannigans (see that Vanity Fair article on Orrin Hatch and you'll be pretty upset...)

Uhm. Good point. But I think that the Luxemborg wrinkle was interesting...
The more interesting idea is peer-to-peer VoIP. That plus crypto and I don't think prying ears could do a whole hell of a lot. In fact, the game may be over on some levels...certainly, CALEA seems to have at best a slippery legal hold on VoIP at all, and that's when the VoIP calls are hubbed or "switched" somehow (you packet heads can remove the quote-marks from 'switched'). Peered VoIP seems to push any eavesdropping all the way out to the edges of the network.
In fact, I'm wondering if there may be a popular 'giving up' underway on the greater crypto issue, with greater starting to encompass voice traffic. Actually, while we're fighting Satan's Minions(TM) (ie, the evil dark-skinned ragheads), nobody seems to care as much about some hydroponic pot growers and whatnot, and Al Qaeda seems to think that word of mouth works just fine for disseminating mission-critical information.

Well, of course those are the conventional channels, and for sure some of them would have been employed. But an all-around secure communications infrastructure would have to include the telephony, or else all of the other precautions can more or less be CALEA'd away 9ie, using the physical infrastructure of CALEA).
And there's also the question of willing "our boys" would be of incurring some international incident by installing eavesdropping devices. Something CALEA-like seems far less instrusive.
Of course, there's laser-based eavesdropping from the outside of the building, and I'd bet this was actually the method used in many cases. Laser/vibration-proof glass apparently does exist (it's installed in that DARPA building in downtown watchamaface VA), but I doubt it's installed in the UN, as it's VERY expensive.

Well I be darned if Mr May hasn't inspired a major burst of eloquence, between this response and Mr Young's.
As for this comment:
"Schools don't educate, but merely serve as a filter for employers to
locate those individuals who aren't going to make trouble at the factory."
At best. In the inner cities the function of schools is strongly hinted at by the following well-used phrase:
"Stay In School!"
In other words, schools keep the crime rates down, as is a well-known statistic. They are basically storage facilities. For real schools we white folks with $$$ can move out to the suburbs or send our kids to private As for,
I basically agree with this, though no doubt there are "Leaders" that play on this (and the latent laziness of all teeneagers) to a tune similar to what May is saying. But in most cases, even "good" schools are a joke, and black folks at least realize this. Did anyone notice that there's only 1 or 2 states in the nation that still require Regents endorsements?
I'll tell you a story.
Back in the late 1980s I taught at a notorious HS in Bedford Stuyvesant. 90% of my students were black. I regarded few of them as stupid, but almost none of them saw the point of studying math...they just didn't see how it could benefit them, and they said this to me on a regular basis.
In one class I had some relatively young and non-troublemaking students. I told them from the beginning that I would not slip the standards so they could pass...they HAD to do homework in order to pass, as that would be the only way they could practice enough for the tests. For the first couple of tests all of the non-immigrant black kids failed. But I hammered them and told them it was going to continue like this unless they did the homework and studied. I made it absolutely clear what I expected from them.
By the end of the semester most of the kids were doing their homework, and passing the quizzes and tests, which I did not make easier in any way. I remember Willie Horne coming in before a test and "complaining" "Mr Durden, I STUDIED last night!". I reached out to feel his forehead and said "Willie? Are you feelin' alright?" Of course, he pulled back and stifled a smile, but he got a 90.

I actually do this for a reason. If I'm not doing a line-by-line response (or sometimes even if I am), I want the original post from which I am excerpting to be visible, so that it can be referred to and determined I am not taking this particular quote out of context.
Well, part of me doesn't entirely disagree. At least, high school teachers should be teaching and not babysitting. I actually consider it hard enough to develop true competence in math or science (enough to teach on the HS level), and then even harder developing the skills necessary to communicate the ideas effectively. A math or physics teacher can't be an effective babysitter, pal, AND guidance counselor. Or at least, not in the kinds of quantities liberals imagine the schools should be filled with.
On the other hand, given the current state of world education in math and science, by 9th grade it's not necessarily too late for a kid to turn into a good mathematician (actually, I myself am an example: in 9th grade I was in a lame but famous private school pulling down low Bs and high Cs in math because I was bored. By 12th grade I was in what was and is regarded as THE top-notch school for math and science in the country, pulling down 100 in calculus...but don't get me wrong, I still know the difference between me and true genius in mathematics).
However, the fact is that the school system sucks. It's a joke. Repeat offenders get bounced from school to school, wrecking classes and the environment everywhere they go. Teachers in most states have 25 classroom hours a week, a number matched nowhere in the world (as far as I've ever heard), and THAT'S in addition to homeroom and other duties. The cirriculum is a silly joke, watered down and watered down so that only someone who never shows up couldn't graduate. (And in black schools you'd be suprised how many times I've heard 'these kids can't learn...don't try'.)
So your whole "burnoff of the eaters" theme misses one critical element: direct contact with kids. If you yourself had seen and met kids you KNEW might actually have quite a talent for math, YES EVEN YOU might be tempted to give a crap, and see if just one or two might somehow be inspiried merely to do some homework. This is particularly true when you realize that you actually LIKE some of these kids, which are as fully human as you are, by the way.
Or, it might just make you even angrier...give your rage some real, practical real-world "fuel" rather than being the theoretical cloistered construct it at least appears to be. At least, 'talent' doesn't seem to be the problem. Inner-city black kids have proven that they can do extremely well in whatever they view as important (I'd argue that some of this is due to genetic superiority)...a well-run school system could easily produce the kind of math and engineering talent needed without brain-draining from other countries (and which is probably not a relaible long-term option).
I don't remember reading any von Neumann where he discusses the idea of "general assemblers"....I'm still not convinced the general physics of that idea works out, and I believe Freeman Dyson has had some similar doubts. But despite that there's a point here...
Hell, you don't have to go that far. Food is already cheap enough that we might regard it as being nearly free. I mean, for a couple of bucks you can buy enough beef to stuff a welfare family of five, and to feed a rural Chinese family for a friggin' week. (Well, at least in the US...) People from mainland China would still regard most welfare families as "rich" by Chinese standards.
I've also witnessed this trend, but I currently believe it only holds in certain segments. There are various "craft" industries (as I call them) where this equation seems to be held in suspension. Like it or not, hip hop is one of those, though I suppose you could argue that the number of hip-hop 'artists' that make it is tiny compared to the audience. But the point is that in a craft industry, we're really referring to specific and local tastes, as opposed to Darwinian selection (ie, the 'most fit'). In a craft there may be room for many to contribute. (Other examples of craft industries are US high-end audio, the wine industry, high-end marijuana, organic foods and cheeses, and the current German-centered board game renassaiance.) What's desired in such an envornment is not necessarily the best/fastest/brightest, but something with a particularly 'quality' that corresponds to local vagaries of culture and taste. (At least, there's no other way to explain the success of "Snoop Doggy Dog"...)
This is certainly possible. On the other hand, depending on how technology unfolds we might all of a sudden find ourselves caught short and looking for talent. And certainly, the have-nots will actually have more and more as time goes on, though perhaps not much land or space.
Well, if they have access to general assemblers they'll be with us forever. And such a burnoff won't be glorious, it'll be a fuckin' shame.

Well, I don't know who's responsible, but teaching what basically amounts to a liberal arts cirriculum is almost certainly useless in the inner cities, and black kids know this...they want something they can USE. Things like authomotive repair or, perhaps, airline baggage screening probably makes a lot more sense.

Well, this is where you lose a lot of credibility on this list, despite your sometimes farily acute technical observations.  Let's just say that your 'philosophy' has concluded that it's probably better for the "useless eaters" be burned off, and that this would be good for the planet (the scary thing is that it's becomming obvious that in the near future neither the planet nor human society will really need 6 billion or more people). So this is your "philosophy"...fine. But you seem to have little or no emotion or sympathy towards those 'lumpen proletariat' (cue commentary on term by James Donald)...in other words, these are people who love/hate/fear/lust/eat just like you, and who don't regard themselves as 'useless', and yet it would seem that history just might pass them by, and that there may be a large segment of human population that will (in the short run) be marginalized, and in the long run be wiped out (according to your philosophies), apparently in some terrible and painful cataclysm.
That your philosophies seemed to have erased any interhuman emotion you may have in this context seems strange. And no, I'm not suggesting that you cry your way out of your ideas, but recognize that if your ideas are correct, they're tragic. That which is 'inevitable' and also cataclysmic and (arguably) avoidable may also easily be tragic. Hell...that's probably the very definition of tragic, and in the most pessimistic of appraisals (ie, yours) the fate of American black folks (with many, possibly millions of exceptions) might easily be tragic, and that's a shame, like all human As you can probably tell, I've never read many secondary or tertiary sources. (ie, as a physicist I've always considered it of dubious usefulness to read ABOUT physics...) I've only read the few more famous von Neumann journal articles I've come across w.r.t. cellular automata...I actually thought he had only written two or three, and I don't remember his ideas of self-replicating machines as including something like a GA, but then again it's easily possible I didn't pick up on the ramifications of what I was reading (which is granted when I was much younger).
Well, perhaps he's just wise to his market.
If true, this is tragic. You might argue that it's necessary, "good" and inevitable, but it's still tragic. Some of these people will be living lives of very high quality, despite their "need for killing". If you got out more, you might know that.

My admission of ignorance of that end of Von Neumann is precisely that: admission of ignorance due to not having read much ABOUT him, and having only read his more famous papers.
As for a universal nano generator, that notion has seemed a little too science-fictiony for my tastes, though in the optical world some of my colleagues were developing some fairly amazing optical lab-benches on a chip, but these are more at the micron scale.
You'll pardon my scepticism about a universal generator being a useful notion any time in the near future...the recently defunct Optical Micro Machines (OMM) couldn't even get a micron-scale 3-D optical cross connect to work reliably (nor could anyone else, including Lucent, MEMS-R-US, or hosts of others), so that nano-scale generator is at least decades away, if it will ever be possible.

Nah nah Variola...I don't think you're getting me here. Or maybe you are...
The problem with inner city school systems where there are large numbers of african american students are, first of all, with notable exceptions (ie, some areas around Atlanta, St Albans Queens, etc...) crime rates are high, and African American students, on average, seem to be 'problems' more than Asians or Jewish kids (certainly), and probably more than whites.
The next problem, and here is where the notion of "storage" comes in, is that administrators in those districts do practically ZERO to keep disruptive, dangerous students out of the classrooms. They also seem to feel that if reasonable standards of behavior were applied throughout these districts, "all the bad kids would end up on the streets", which is true. Meanwhile, good black students must therefore tolerate high numbers of disruptive, dangerous, and armed delinquents in the schools, and so classes begin to turn into baby-sitting sessions.
All of this pretty much comes from tolerating bad behavior, because "they" can't help themselves.
What I'm saying is that, as long as there are public schools (and I still think public schooling could be a good idea, albeit in a highly modified form), they need to be completely color blind in the standards, and damn the consequences to society at large. What they'll find is that a suprising number of African Americans will rise to the challenge, and do as well in college as other ethnic groups.
Now if you're saying that public schools shouldn't even exist...well...OK, whatever. But as long as they DO exist, its best we run them in a way where they are what they are supposed to be. And if they're supposed to be storage facilities, then put gaurds and watercannon into armories and send the Scoops around to collect up the "students" off the streets every morning.

No doubt the difference in success rate between Asians (and not just Asian Americans, but fresh-off-the-boat Chinese or Vietnamese) and blacks has become conspicuous in recent years, and I agree says a lot about what ISN'T being done, or taken advantage of in the US by some groups.

Of course, it might be argued that any attempt at reforming the state is inherently statist, but I'm not convinced that a cataclysmic meltdown is necessary. It seems to me only reasonable to attempt to make things better, while the inevitable unfolds, if it will.
Which brings me to a sideswipe at the vehement anti-statists on the board...if something like crypto-anarchy is ultimately inevitable, then why bother "outing" the statists? Instead, to further the anti-state goals, it might actually be far more expedient to encourage said statists in their use and proliferation of strong crypto, thereby speeding the inevitable through the very same vectors that seek to delay it.

Basically, in the inner cities the armories are converted into "schools", with a giant partition in the middle. On one side are self-learning stations and a small number of instructors. Kids can choose to go to this side of the partition whenever they want, or never. (BUT school is mandatory from 12 to 22, and big Soylent Green-type scoops scoop up the students every morning and dump them into the school.)
The other side of the partition is basically a giant gymnasium. Guards with watercannon are stationed in the balcony to break up fights.
At graduation, there's a trap door on the gymnasium side, that opens onto a slide leading directly to Rikers.
In the extended version, the "schools" are located out in a gulag, and students live there from ages 10 to 24. There are two jobs in the schools, one is breaking rocks, which are imported from other schools, the other is making rocks in concrete molds, which are exported.
Classrooms consist of a teacher behind a plexiglass wall, giving lessons over a loudspeaker that's cranked far higher than any kid could scream or yell. Thus, classroom noise is basically eliminated as a practical concern (the teacher might also have access to watercannon behind the plexiglass As for teachers, the source is clear: those that fail to graduate must teach for a period of 10 to 15 years.

Here's the question Tyler Durden has for you.
Which is more important...annhiliation of the state, or getting a bunch of list subscribers to agree that annhiation of the state is a good thing?
You yourself have claimed to be something of a "techno determinist". In other words, you've made a good case that Strong crypto will eventually lead to collapse of the state...people's BELIEF about the implications of strong crypto are largely irrelevant.
"Eurotrash", "New York Collectivists" and so on should be given nice, big fat pat on the backs, so long as this will encourage proliferation of strong crypto. Who gives a crap what people BELIEVE?
In fact, I'd argue that, if your beliefs prove to be correct, then "making people see the implications of strong crypto" is ultimately probably a bad thing...not everyone wants to wreck the state. Some people WANT to be able to boss others around (or at least want someone else to be doing this). Hell, probably most human beings in 2003 are in this category.

I'm thinking about a WiFi repeater...
Imagine I work on a high floor in an office tower, but I know that very nearby, on the ground floor, there's a public WiFi hotspot.
Now let's say I want to be able to access that hotspot, but I'm currently out of range due to the height.
DOES THERE EXIST something like a WiFi "repeater", which will allow me to "reach" that public WiFi spot without my being within 200 feet or so? (I deploying one or more repeaters throughout our offices so that I can reach the public hotspot.)
Of course, it's also better if that repeater masks who I am to the real hotspot, and terminates encryption on both sides. But of course, I don't want it to cost a ton, and I probably don't want anyone else to be able to use it either.
One nice application of this is to be able to regularly send messages from this public spot, but without anyone every actually seeing me. And if the "last" repeater is in these (private) offices somewhere, it's doubtful anyone would ever be able to tell that this is occurring.

@_subject: P2P + Instant Messaging = WASTE 
Here's an article off the Lightreading website. Probably nothing new for this list, but it does bring together a number of interesting ideas. Are we seeing the birth of blacknet here? And now imagining adding telephony to Two of the hottest applications in networking -- peer-to-peer networks and instant messaging -- are being combined in the form of private P2P networks that are taking shape in the more secretive corners of the Internet, industry insiders say.
The most popular software for creating these private networks is WASTE, which enables anyone with a computer and a Net connection to set up a private peer-to-peer network over the Internet.
Between the FBI and the Justice Department and the Record Industry of America Association cracking down on file sharing, it was only a matter of time before users found a more secure, private way to swap software and music, says Brian Bruns, security administrator at SOSDG (Summit Open Source Development Group). The SOSDG hosts one of about 30 different sites where the WASTE software can be downloaded for free.
WASTE differs from P2P networks like Kazaa and Limewire as it creates a closed network for instant messaging and file-sharing with trusted users. The person running the network has to swap a key with potential users before they are allowed on the network. An encryption layer is then set up between two computers using private keys to authenticate the parties. Up to 50 people can be on one network.
There are thousands of copies out there, but theres no way to tell exactly how many people are using it, as its designed to be secure, says Bruns.
WASTE was developed a year ago by developer Justin Frankel, founder of Nullsoft. AOL (NYSE: TWX - message board) acquired Nullsoft for its Winamp MP3 software, and while Frankel was with the company he wrote WASTE. However it was deemed to be an unauthorized project, according to Bruns, and AOL yanked it.
Michael Gartenberg, analyst with Jupiter Research Ltd., says anything believed to encourage illegal file sharing would have a major black mark against it, which is probably why AOL scrapped the project after posting it on a site for one day.
He says the crackdown by the RIAA on illegal file sharing has fueled the distribution of this software. The more consequences there are for actions, the more the activity is driven underground Criminals dont hold public meetings, Gartenberg says.
Its a way to chat without having someone watching you, says Bruns. His open source group took a copy of the entire WASTE site as it was posted on AOL, and stored it away for future use. It has since been distributed widely, including to SourceForge, which has worked on improving the original Gartenberg notes that WASTE is unlikely to reach the lofty heights of fame achieved by Kazaa, which has been downloaded over 200 million times. With WASTE you have to know someone in the network, it closes down the number of people available, he says.
Still, the concept of private or personal P2P networks might still find its way into the mainstream, courtesy of Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT - message board). The software giant is trialing a program called  (nothing to do with the 70s pop divas, it seems), which allows users to create small private networks of up to 10 people to exchange instant messages, animations, pictures and music.
Right now the software is part of Microsofts NetGen division, which aims to develop products aimed at 13- to 24-year-olds, but there are broader implications for this product within the corporate world. Think of workgroups collaborating on documents or powerpoint presentations.

As a big, sloppy footnote to this, I'd point out that (these days) anything that does not jibe with the current right-wing party line is now called "Left", even though there's really not much that is particularly left economically (or politically for that matter) in what's said in quotes such as below. It seems odd to me that such a wide variety of political views are all called "left" simply they don't proclaim the US as savior-to-the-world.
Of course, there are those with fairly leftist views in these ranks, but that's not all that relevant. The interesting thing however is that American liberalism is now seen as right-wing (in the pro-US policy sense) by international "leftists" (meaning international dissidents), indicating it's complete and total moral failure.

Nicely written prose, but simply wrong. The existence of China as a freewheeling capitalist superpower but yet with little civil "democracy" per se pretty much proves that this widely-held myth is wrong. And I don't see any inherent reason to believe this will change.
And even on the economic side, deals in China follow closely upon the power of relationships. If you are well-connected you have a much better chance of your business succeeding than if you are not. Indeed, if you are not well connected then you run the chance of eventually running afoul of whatever laws exist out there and your operation could be greatly curtailed. If you are well-connected than almost no law can stand in your way. And China won't be the only society that follows this pattern. Vietnam will go a similar route as well perhaps other nations in SE Asia. Perhaps North Korea will eventually follow this model.
And you know what? It works, and there looks like there's no inherent reason to believe it somehow has to be more egalitarian or more fair. In the end our beliefs about democracy and free markets have much more to do with Western history and social development than any divine law of the universe.
The moral of this story is that having a "free market" (whatever that means) is not the same thing as having political freedom. You have to continue to fight for both. Those that tell you that capitalism equals freedom are probably the same ones that will launch a war in Iraq for the grand cause of Halliburton and Bechtel, touting this set of nice lies so that the locals will lay down and take it up the ass, all in the name of "democracy".

That was nothing compared to the real damage, which I've heard few people point out. There was a telecom CO in (I think)  World Trade Center, and falling debris took the giant Verizon CO across the street on West Street offline for almost a week. The result was that Wall Street was basically cut off for several days...the effect of that dwarfs all the other stuff. (Although I wonder...Pipar Jaffrey was pretty much wiped out. Even if the records survived, they lost so much manpower that might have actually had a small but worldwide impact.) Of course, I truly doubt OBL & his posse realized this when they targeted the WTC (and the fact that they continue to pretty much ignore relatively ungarded COs shows they still don't realize this). If they took out a few key COs downtown one morning the effect on the economy would be significant.

JA, ya' gotta good point here.

In this case, they won't even be trying to break it down to circuits prior to storage...they may instead dump the raw OC-Ns directly onto some kind of fast storage medium and then sift through it later.
The idea of duplicating all optical traffic seems a little farfetched, though, but I bet everything from the cable landings may soon get swallowed whole, if it isn't already. I'm still thinking they must do some kind of "grooming" prior to mass backhauls of traffic. There are just too many fibers and too many transmission systems out there for them to duplicate all of it. Perhaps at the routers they sniff, and then CALEA whatever circuit that conversation came out of.

size data, not as tricky as IP decoding.  Predicatable bandwidth.
Stream all into megadisks, analyze later."
I'm gonna have to challenge this bit here, Variola.
Let's back up. You've got an OC-48 or OC-192 fiber and you want to grab ALL of the data in this fiber. Now I'll grant that in real life there's going to be a lot telephony circuit in there, but let's take a worst-case and assume you need ALL the data.
What's in this OC-192? Right now it definitely ain't 10Gb/s of packets. It's going to have LOTS of DS1s, DS3s and, if you're lucky, and STS-3c or two. So you'll need to first of all demux ALL of the tributaries.
Next, you've got to un-map any ATM in each of the DS1s, etc, and then pull out the IP data from the ATM cells, remembering to reassemble fragmented packets (and there will be plenty with ATM). And remember, you may have to do this for 5000 simultaneous DS1s. Oh, and let's not forget pointer adjustments. You can't just blindly grab stuff...remember that all those tribs come from different STRATUM 1/3 clocks, so they'll be moving at different speeds and as a result have periodic slips w.r.t the STS-192 And that's just one fiber. How will you actually get all of this traffic back to HQ? Remember, it keeps coming and won't stop.
No, I think I'm becomming convinced that they can't yet get ALL of it. But they DO probably grab complete wavelengths and backhual them, storing them for later study. (They must do some grooming too. For instance, they probably CALEA everything into and out of Brooklyn, and then that will get switched over to the Beltway where it will be packed into a GIG-BE OC-768 back to storage and processing.)

Dark fiber.
"Dark Fiber" ain't a talisman you merely wave at data to get it to magically move to where you want it to.You've got to LIGHT that fiber, and to light that fiber you need LOTS and LOTS of power-hungry, space-occupying equipment. In other words, you'd need to duplicate a significant fraction of the current public transport network. And that can't be done in one location, you'd need this shadow network to have either it's own COs all over the country, or to have significant POPs in practically every CO in the country. And I can tell you unequivocally that neither are the case.
What this points to is CALEA + Grooming + Massive Optical Transport for offline sifting in a few centralized locations. And I strongly suspect that the recent GIG-BE contract is precisely the massive optical part.
What I get from what you've pointed out, however, is that processing power isn't the limitation any longer. If they COULD get it ALL, then they probably would. So perhaps that's just a matter of time (ULH systems can move lots of traffic very long distances these days, with only the occasional optical amplifier.)

Yes, but I think it's fairly clear that if one needs to dissasemble the OC-Ns in the field, you simply need too much gear. It's going to be far easier to grab whole swathes of it and ship it back to Montana or wherever for it to be sifted through later.
What they probably do, however, is grab specific DS1s/3s locall and switch those via CALEA back to optical access points, where all of this stuff is pulled together into OC-192s or (very soon) OC-768s. As Variola suggests, once you get it back then you can plow through it at your leisure. Got a disident you want to shut down?

For some things, sure. Actually I know from first hand experience. (I've actually been in an NSA, DISA, and a few other experimental network nodes.) Lots of the equipment I saw was from the big vendors, most notably Lucent and Nortel. Somewhere deeper than I had access to, however, they almost certainly use special silicon.
OK, so you're saying that this suitcase takes in say 10 OC-192s, demuxes all of them down to the DS1 level (we're at 50,000 DS1s), demaps and unpacks the ATM cells, and then reassembles all of the packets therein? Questions:

2) I've been in dozens of COs myself, and have worked extensively with people who have spent (collectively speaking) centuries in them. They never saw such a magic box a you describe, and indeed would certainly know about someone trying to install one. Or perhaps the NSA has developed a cloaking device making the box invisible?
2) What silicon does it use? Are you saying that the government can do a LOT better than 0.13 microns these days? Somehow I doubt it. Look at the off-the-shelf SONET chip architectures. Sure, there's lots of stuff onboard that you wouldn't need for what you're talking about, but getting rid of that stuff would still put the most advanced chip lightyears behyind what you're talking about.
3) If the majic box doesn't store the data, how does it get it back to HQ? Telepathy? Or, does it use a bank of lasers that somehow are several orders of magnitude more efficient that off-the-shelf lasers? (And let us remember that there's a fundamental constraint with bulk optics..an optical multiplexer or ciculator can't be an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength it will support.)
JA's comments about fiber exhaust are dead-on, and were not known to most of the Telecom Bubble participants. (Indicates the dude knows what he's talking about with respect to telecom.)
But dark fibers aren't a real concern. It would be easy to develop a DWDM system that operated over the L or M bands, "under" the C-band wavelengths used by a carrier. So the problem isn't the fiber, it's lighting it.
As for my comments about cable landings, I explicity stated that the splices back to VA were seen and known. And yes, I was in a position to know. (There's not a lot you can hide in a CO...it's not like they staff them with NSA agents or something.)

Well, perhaps but perhaps not. Burst-mode signaling, transceivers, and networking technology are a good example. If you see DISA, NSA, and DARPA all working with the acknoledged experts inthe academic field, and if you see them spending $$$ on burst-mode testbeds, then it's clear that there are some issues they haven't solved. Of course, they may not be the issues WE think they are, but you get some idea.
What that also hints at is that they can't actually always backhaul EVERYTHING. Their interest in burst-mode indicates they still view bandwidth as an obstacle (and not dark fiber, but actual lit bandwidth). Of course, their bandwidth "problem" is probably at orders of magnitude greater than we'd consider a problem, but their continued interest in burst mode probably indicates there are times when they have huge amounts of data that needs to get through i a short amount of time, and they don't want to clog up a Well, there's the famous Adaptive Optics story centered around bringing Manua Kea online. When the Manua Kea designers were trying to solve some of the big issues ca. 1988, the military (as part of one of their dual-use programs) declassified Laser Guidestar research they had done in 1962!
In other cases you can, however, take a reasonably good guess. Remember, during the bubble there was billions poured in by the private sector in making lasers more efficient, smaller, etc...There just happen to be physical limitations. But I have zero doubt that the NSA can't make a laser that is siginificantly more efficient than what I can buy off the shelf.
Actually, this is a most interesting point. Those cables are not merely giant rubber hoses running around on the sea floor...the telecom equipment is actually powered via an electrical layer in the cable sheath. And then remember that there are lots of fibers in any one of those cables, and that the signal therein might easily need to be amplified due to splice losses. So that Sub (which I know exists) must really be something to see. Almost makes me want to join the dark side!
(Oh yeah, come to think of it I did actually work on an NSA project that examined some undersea optical component failures out of one of their networks. From the components we looked at, I can only guess what their network topology must have been (OC-3 ATM, BTW), but I can only take vague guesses as to what it must do).

Certainly, the Spooks have their own fabs, and I don't think they even hide this fact (I doubt they could, ultimately). And certainly, the Spooks crank out all sort of special ASICs using their own IP as well as some store-bought stuff they drop onto their designs.
However, where I have some BIG doubts is whether their fab is X generations ahead of the most advanced commercial fabs. Frankly, I bet they have a pretty good fab that was modified by a commercial vendor to support small production runs. This fab, however, does not utilize cosmic rays for etching or whatever. It's probably 0.13 microns at best (wait...I think Taiwan Semi and a couple of other places are one step ahead of this). This limits what they can do with a chip or chipset, and implies that they won't be orders of magnitude better at opening up LOTS of traffic.

In other words, if they have to deploy a black-bag operation every few weeks, then that makes the odds of them being 'outed' sooner rather than later much greater. It might even deter survelliance except "when it really counts".

Ah Variola...do I detect a wee bit of Knee-jerk in your otherwise consistently iconoclastic views? Let's take a looksee...
Think I'm gonna have to disagree with ya' hear partner.
For one, in the old days Corporations regularly hired goons to mow down striking coalminers and whatnot.
OK, those days are all gone, right? Wrong. Halliburton and Bechtel have both hired mercs for their Iraq operations. (In fact, I was on a call a couple of weeks ago where a Halliburton official was describing the casualties they take on a regular basis. These don't get reported much in the news, though, for obvious reason...)
However, a corporation doesn't actually have to hire the goons these days in order to get the job done, not when it's much cheaper to call upon the publically-available pool of goons that function as a government in some places. The fact that some corporations may leverage existing thuggery to get their job done doesn't make them any less complicit. But this is all besides my main point...
Well, this is where I suspect a little knee-jerk. I'm no socialist: in no way am I saying that "Corporations are inherently evil". (In fact, I'm hoping to continue profiting admirably as the result of my participation in the capitalist system.) What I think bares investigation is whether or not, here in the US, a subset of the big corporations are so tied in with the political engine as to be complicit in the violations we both agree are As Max said so eloquently, this is not to imply that "we should make some laws and eliminate these big evil corporations". Or maybe it is (I dunno...I'm a stoopid Cypherpunk...). But I don't think it's inherently inconsistent to point out that there may be a direct correlation between the activities of our particular State and the interests of a subset of Large, Old-money-dominated US Coporations.

Sure, you might be able to make that argument.

OK, I keep getting this shit. Right now, I can't tell if it's anti-agit-prop or simply a well-intentioned but idiotic muslim chick (something about the wording made me assume this was a female).
Listen up. Cypherpunks is a cryptography list, and al-qaeda.net is a node. The subscribers to this list may or may not sympathize with the activites of the "Real" "al-qaeda". The name al-qaeda is, I suspect, more or less tongue-in-cheek, and at the least (or perhaps the most) a head-nod at some of the gripes that real organization has with the US government, and those that continue to support it's activites abroad. However, there does not appear to be any regular posters to this list that are involved with al-qaeda the "terror" network. (Actually, if there are, it would be interesting to hear from them via the remailers.)
Cypherpunks is an extremely diverse group of indivduals, that do not appear to agree on a great many number of things. What binds us together (if anything) is the interest in cryptographic techniques that would appear to offer the capability of secure communications, with "communications" meaning any kind of transaction that can be transmitted by data over electronic or optoelectronic networks. Another thing that seems to bind us (and again "bind" is probably a poor choice of words) is an extreme tolerance to opinions very different from that of any one subscriber.
Therefore please get a fuckin' clue. If you want to discuss the role of "Radical" Islam in contemporary world politics, I'm sure there are those that would be interested in doing so. Otherwise, please fuck off.

criminals from taking advantage of the completely secure communication

Silliness itself, at this point. Practical quantum cryptography at this point is limited to transmission. The moment it goes O/E, it's as vulnerable as any other data. And terrorists aren't going to bother splicing fiber.
Of course, primitive quantum storage (with error correcting codes!) is possible and done in laboratories, but we're talking tens of bits here. It'll be a decade before quantum storage is practical, and that's only IF someone can find a convincing reason to start developing it.

Storage wasn't my point per se. My point was that quantum cryptography only becomes unsnoopable* when it's in the optical form. With current optical fiber technologies this would limit the useful bandwidth distance product to short distances (ie, 10s of Km for key exchanges). After that, the signal must go O/E and then it's just the same as any normal digital signal.
Where Quantum Crypto might have application is in small metro area deployments, like downtown NYC or the DC Beltway, and where people are completely totally balls-to-the-wall paranoid about security (ie, they assume an attacker is willing to tap into their fiber and has all of the test sets needed to pull out a useful packet exchange--that ain't no pimply-face DoS script bunny, and hell it ain't Al Qaeda either).
Of course, to extend quantum protection beyond mere transport you'd need all sorts of quantum logic gates and processors (in addition to storage), but don't look for that in our lifetimes.

However, there are some things that Bush did that, symbolically at least, he should have been drummed out for.

Ah. A fellow knowledgeable China-hand.
As far as I'm concerned, what Kung Tze does ca 5 BCE is really consdolidate and codify a large and diverse body of practices and beliefs under a fairly unified set of ethical ideas. In that sense, the Legalists were merely a refocusing of the same general body of mores, etc...into a somewhat different direction. One might call it a competing school to Kung Tze de Jiao Xun, but I would argue only because, at that time, Kung Tze "authority" as it's known today was by no means completely established. But in a sense, the early legalists weren't a HECK of a lot different from Confucious.
As for Mr Donald's ramblings, the are in which they most closely approach reality is where filial obedience to the emperor is developed as an extension to his ethical system, but even here there are significant differences. For one, that filial loyalty is not portrayed as being ultimately political, but almost an extension of family (which is why the emperor was known as the "Son of Heaven").
Also, and this is fairly Cypherpunkish, unlike in the west the notin of Emperor was not ultimately a genetic one.

Mr Donald's comments are almost completely nonsensical. or rather, they vaguely reflect some aspects of reality glimpsed through a really fucked up mirror while on bad crack.
Probably Mr Donald is referring to something he saw on TV about China's response (or relative lack of response) to Japan's Meiji Restoration.
China definitely did not respond to foregin ideas of industrialization and technology like the Japanese did. (Or at least, not at the time!) But it should be remembered that China did slowly and steadily evolve it's technology, and was well ahead of the western world until the Enlightenment.
However, blaming the Chinese response to the Meiji restoration on officially unsanctioned thought illustrates a complete cluelessness about China. During that time Chinese intellectuals (which at the time meant practically anyone who had any kind of an education) regularly debating notions of "Ti Yung", or the tension between what is esentially Chinese vs what's useful from the Western World (and by the 1860s it was starting to become clear that the west had some advanced ideas). This is far more than a top-down dictatorship in the Stalinist sense, just as the Cultural Revolution was for more than a bunch of teenagers "obeying orders".
In the end, a simplistic (though not clueless) argument could be made that China decided to remain "Chinese" rather than embrace what would have been a big disruption to their way of life. As it turned out, the 20th century (and the Japanese) more or less forced this new way of life on them.
Hell..come to think of it, the closest precedent to the US invasion of Iraq might be the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.

2. Several provinces of China are larger than all of Western Europe. Even a very high-priority message could take months to propagate.
3. "Control' of China 2500 years ago was almost nonexistent. It was a geographically, ethnically, and linguistically diverse set of quasi-nation-states. To even imagine them to be anything like a modern nation state indicates you are extrapolating your bizarre little philosophical universe well beyond the breaking point. (But then again, that wasn't too hard!)
4. Event the early Ryu-Jya (Legalists) were nothing like what you imagine modern laws to be. In fact, their activity probably centers on creating an established set of standardized weights (ie, for weighing food and whatnot). "Law" in early China was NOTHING like what you imagine it to be, and was a higly decentralized affair. Indeed, modern China is rapidly 'deteriorated' into the same.

Again, you seem to visualize me as (-1) times yourself, or basically your old commie self.
The point I continue to harp on (and that you fail to understand) is that, despite how well one may argue that one sees reality 'objectively' (and others don't), completely alternate viewpoints are possible and very often held by others throughout the world. An action like the US in Iraq (irregardless of what you believe the objective reality to be) is futile precisely because it only re-inforces the world view of the locals (ie, that the US is a giant, bullying oppressive regime that has stuck it's big dick into the holy land and needs force to remove it).
In other words, perception is often reality, and until you (and others like you) accept that, then we'll continue to have bloodbath after bloodbath, initated by 'Christian' and 'Islamic' true believers alike.

Ah. This is an interesting point.
The Qing were 1) Manchus (ie, not Han Chinese)...they were basically a foreign occupation that stuck around for a while; and 2) (Nominally Tibetan) Buddhists. Although they of course adhered to the larger Confucian notions, they in many ways deviated from mainstream Confucian beliefs.
Also, you need to get more specific about WHEN during the Qing dynasty you believed this occurred. During the 19th century this is most certainly NOT true, and there are many famous naval battles that occurred between the British and the Chinese navies (in fact, the famous Stone Boat in the Summer palace was built using funds that were supposed to pay for real ships).
But perhaps you meant ocean-going boat ownership by private individuals, and that is certainly something that was a BIG no-no during many epochs of Chinese civilization. And indeed, this is probably precisely why the Chinese had to defend themselves from British attack, rather than the other way But this has nothing to do with Confucianism per se, but is more directly related to good old traditional Chinese xenophobia.
In the end, Chinese unification was probably a devil's bargain. It created a far more stable "nation", but at the cost of human freedom. But it's not precisely like this was imposed on the populace from without...that it was successful at all in a place as large and remote as China is a testimony to Chinese dislike of "Wai Guo" culture.

I can't tell if you're arguing me with or just yourself. You seem to equate disagreement with your assessment with a viewpoint that is completely To say that China was "despotic" would, on average, be accurate. But then again, one must remember that a form of despotism where the despots are months away is very different from modern forms of despotism.
Today's China is in some ways similar to China during many dynasties. The emperor sleeps some insect with a big, fat stinger awakens him and then he gets mad, swats it, and then goes back to sleep. When the locals are fairly certain the emperor is sleeping soundly, they go about their business.
Call it despotism if you want, but really it's essentially Chinese.

And the remotest parts of China at that time (the borders are far larger now, of course) weren't any closer than a month or two, no matter what the orders.

You are apparently simply unaware of the real size and terrain of China. There were villages in remote parts of China that were unaware of Mao's death into the early 1980s. Travel around in China for a while and you'll get the picture. Just to give you an idea, short of renting out a helicopter, there are plenty of parts of China that are more than a week away from even me, living here in NYC.
No, as usual you seem to think that because I disagree with the simplicity of your "grid" that I must believe the opposite. Let's put it this way: The Qin was absolutely despotic in areas that could be guessed at ("Burn Books Kill Scholars"), as well as quite despotic in areas that would seem pointless now (like bell volumes, because bells were also measurements for grain). They also completely didn't care about other things that you would think a despot would really care about.
A thing to think about was that Qin Shr Huang seemed to truly believe that everything he did was necessary for the unification of China (which he accomplished). YOU (not me) might argue that by unifying a large portion of central China he actually prevented a lot more deaths due to "Barbarian" incursion by "Unfree and uncivilized" Muslims...OOPS--Did I say that? I mean "Unfree and backward people that should be killed".

This is where the "Simplistic Grid" comes in. The momentum of Chinese culture will oalways outlive any short-term despotism, and the Chinese on many levels know this. When it comes to China, even some of the Han-dominated areas are incredibly difficult to get to, and when you start talking about Southern parts of Yunnan, most parts of Tibet, and places like Qinhai and Xinjiang, the idea of a lightening-fast and efficient despotism starts to sound dubious. Indeed, these areas are only barely under Beijing control today. It's also a main reason why Burma and the Golden triangle find it very easy to ship heroin overland through China to Hong Kong rather than go at it via a more direct route.
Anhui and central China suffered far more than other parts of China. I'd guess that 70% of the deaths due to starvation during 58 to about 64 occurred in that part of Central China. The obvious reasons were: 1) Proximity and easy communicatuion with Beijing, and 2) Large tracts of previously arable land (ie, you don't bother exerting despotism over an area that can't do much anyway).
No, I am arguing that Chinese communism was a different thing from Soviet commusim, for the precise reason that the weight of Chinese history would be fairly quick to erase Chinese commusim. Any China hand could have predicted exactly that, and indeed that's precisely what happened. Our decision to back the far-more corrupt Chiang regime all the way to 1973 or whenever, was a major blunder, if for no other reason then to accelerate the isolation of the Soviets. Mao would have been very hip to the manuever, and I bet would have welcomed it (The Soviets were never very useful to the Chinese communists). In other words, even a smart rabid anti-communist should have recognized that backing Mao's "Bandits" was at some point obvious, but most were far too blinded by their ideology to see that.
The same thing's happening with Iraq and Iran. Iran's making overtures that we consistently ignore because were too darned dumb and power-oriented to see the opportunity.

That war was won (or lost, depending on how you look at it) by the inherent failures of communism itself, not because the US Government was some kind of champion of freedom.

Hell--East Asian communism might rightfully be blamed on the outcome of World War I and the need to create some kind of anti-western hegemony.
A libertarian might possibly look at the US Government and it's legions of "Conservatives" as being a sort of tag-along (at best) or leech, grabbing a ride on the back of certain industries and (of course) "championing them" against other technologies (eg, defense, oil, autos...).

Well, perhaps. Then again, consider though primordial blacknet systems currently labeled P2P.

As a result, they are turning up the pressure slowly, but only just fast enough for such systems to proliferate while evolving a nice protective coating (despite all the recent lawsuits). By the time these systems represent a destabilising influence (ie, you can pay someone for a file over anonymous swarmed P2P) it'll be too late.
In short, Group-of-Bandits X is a group of bandits precisely because they couldn't survive otherwise...ie, they're not smart enough. They'll eventually go the way of the dodo, though they can prolong their exodus somewhat through drastic means.

Yes, I am indeed a little suspicious. Clearly, this "quantum repeater" can't be doing an O/E, or no amount of hype will budge this product an inch.
Quantum Crypto utilizes pairs of correlated photons, so we can't be talking about an optical amplifer.
So since I've been away from the literature for a while, is there a device that can repair a deteriorating, about-to-be-collapsed superposition state? I can't see how this could occur without the requirement of acting on the other (correlated) photon either, and if that photon is physically removed from the first, then forget about it. (Though theoretically I think I can conceive of the possibility of two "correlated quantum repeaters" exchanging 'information' (including gating) about the photon pair they are collectively handling*, but no way that can be useful commerically.)
*: This isn't quite as farfetched as it seems: Even 5 to 10 years ago it was shown that there can be quantum Forward Error Correction, and simple devices were demonstrated in the laboratory.

Actually, that's an interesting point.
In places like downtown NYC, if the fiber doesn't actually go to the basement of a building, it will certainly go within a few 100 feet, so that last hop is trivial. (But the kind of companies this would be targeted for this would already have fiber to the premises or FTTP anyway....however, that fiber will only on occasion make it all the way to the telecom room...the internal building wiring will often be copper.)
However, it's not like you'd have a continuous piece of fiber all the way from Customer X Location A to Customer X Location B...you'd definitely go through at least one fiber distributing frame (FDF) aka an optical "patch panel". However, the connectors will almost certainly be at least slightly anisotropic, so you'd get a wavefunction collapse, or at least diminish the distance you can go.
So I imagine they actually perform a splice and remove the connectors...this will limit you of course to new, high quality fiber (which is extremely isotropic, and I know this for a fact having previously done a lot of testing for PMD, or Polarization Mode Dispersion.)
An interesting thing to think about is the fact that in dense metro areas, you pretty much have a "star" from the CO out to a premise (which is the cause of deployment of "Collapsed SONET Rings"). This means the other photon of your encrypted pair might easily pass through the same CO somewhere, which would make the system suscpetible to a sort of man in the middle attack. Or at least, your fancy quantum crypto system has defaulted back to standard crypto in terms of its un-hackability.

Well, your initial postulate was stated in such a way as to be fairly unrefutable, the key word being "float". Only companies, etc...provide that by requiring that the transacted funds flow through their coffers for a moment, where they extract their discount revenue. At this stage of the game, nobody when their head screwed on tight would argue that Internet-based businesses don't represent an increase in Risk (whether that increase will eventually make float-based business models impossible is an entirely different matter).
Interestingly, the Visa organization recently launched a Purchasing Card platform which merely facilitates EFTs (a step towards your oft-mentioned "Geodesic Society"?)...there's a fixed and small discount revenue touch that's independent of the size of the transaction (and they can afford to do this because there's no float, ergo no risk). In this case, Visa is providing "value added" information systems for the transactions, but in a sense they're allowing their member banks to more or less completely step out of the transaction if they wish.
Now of course, Paragraph 2 is only related to Paragraph 1 by the fact that I wrote both of them in one post. To my knowledge, Visa's new PCard platform has nothing to do with Internet-based risk PER SE, but in the long run I'll doubt we'll lable this a coincidence.

Well, as a research toy QC seems gee-wiz super cool.
I'm still not super-impressed by the current set of applications.
In particular, consider that random number generator. Although QM does indeed predict that experimental outcomes will be 'random', they are random within the weightings imposed by the measuring apparatus. In a sense, this is the perfect analog to the notion that, "Your crypto algorithm may be unbreakable, but your hard/software ain't."
Consider...I set up my random number generator to spit out a 1 every time a photon passes through a half-silvered mirror, and a 0 every time it reflects. Over time the silvering on the mirror is going to degrade, or perhaps it's already not perfect but you need a large number of 'measurements' and/or analysis to begin to see it. In any event, your probabilities are going to shift over time, yielding an imperfect distribution of 0s/1s. Sure, it's still "random", but the probability density function is no longer useful for many applications.
Right now I can't see why this would be any more desirable than, for instance, grabbing the outcome of some distinctly nonlinear process, or perhaps many other approaches to RNG. The only thing this does is allow users/buyers to think their system is now free of any deep technical issues that may make classical systems insecure.

First of all, the guy is a major dumbass...
I'm thinking that the state-of-the-art on Cypherpunks is such that no real comment here is necessary.
This is precisely why Al-Qaeda sent 19 (or probably more) true-believers. Even if TSA lowers the odds, all you have to do is roll the dice many more times, and a few of the faithful will definitely get through the checkpoint. Security measures might stop a lone crazy, but the odds don't stand up if they send dozens of people into airports all around the country. And Iraq II is promising us a bumper crop of new 'terrorists'.
Seems to me it's going to be much easier for the US to stop fucking around over there. Oh wait, we can't do that because "then the terrorists have won". Waitaminute...doesn't Algeria prove that terrorism wins, eventually?

OK, Mr Donald...you're shittin' me, right?
If you define a suicide mission a priori as the act of a terrorist (I guess I do), then by definition anyone who performs such an act is a terrorist. Therefore, anyone who performs a suicide mission looks like a terrorist. Guess it's simple, then eh?
Yer trollin me, I just know it! YAAGH but I can't help myself...I gotta respond! I guess it's OK then if we don't allow strange looking people on the planes. Come to think of it, I think YOU look like a terrorist...
OK, so you not only want to stop anybody odd looking from getting on an airplane, you want near-welfare, minimum-wage HS dropouts be responsible for determining what "odd" means?
Huh? The one flaw in this logic is that this only works if you can send this particular definition of suspicious "looks" backwards in time. The shoe-bomber is a particularly interesting case, as I believe the dude was ethnically British. He might have looked odd from the photo you saw circulated in the press, but I'd bet a lot of money no one would have picked him as looking like a terrorist. However, since we now know about what the shoe-bomber looks like, it should be relatively easy to stop his genetic clones or identical twins from boarding planes in the future. "Problem Solved" indeed. However, this might not work against people that DON'T look like the shoe-bomber.
Hum. An interesting, Stalinist logic. Well, Stalin was on a certain level immensely practical. I say we build a big electrified fence around Cobble Hill Brooklyn and fuck 'em...SOMEONE in there is definitely Al-Qaeda, therefore let's assume everyone in there's guilty until proven innocent.
So likewise would you agree that if any non-citizen US soldiers (there are 10s of thousands non-citizen soldiers in the US) are captured in the numerous future wars, then they captors have the right to execute them on the spot? Uhm...no Geneva convention or anything? What the hell, it's a free-for-all anyway!
Wow. Since Iranians are Indo-European (ie, white), then in the event of war with Iran would you advocate rounding up all Americans of Indo-European ancestry? Does this have to be "pure", or should we grab the African Americans too (which have large % of Indo-European genes)?
Oh wait, most of the Afghans are Indo-Europeans too. So if you're arrested then you'll certainly understand that we're really just protecting the US from your possible collusion with your relatives in Afghanistan...
What seems to be clear to me is that you believe that your opinions originate from some self-consistent logical framework that is "unpopular" in some quarters. What also seems clear to me that it's really an inconsistent hodgepodge thrown up around the real goal, American domination at all costs, damn the logic and damn the consequences.

Afghans and Iranians are not Arabs.
Sub-saharan Africa has tens of millions of fully black Muslims.

If we did I suspect Black Muslims might start fighting back.

The struck us because we've been fuckin' over a large swath of the Muslim (not only Arab) world for 100 years or so now. They're tired of us being there and muckin' around in their politics, and they want it to stop. The "fundamentalist" part is sort of a 'strengthener', let's say...here's people who know they're probably going to have to kill large numbers of civilians to get their point across, so how can they justify this?

But more importantly, are you seeing where this is headed? Let's forget differing ideologies and get really, really practical here. If you or I were grabbed in our own country and brought 7000 miles away, and then tortured for 2 years, wouldn't you most likely become convinced that the torturing nation was a great evil that had to be stopped? Even more, what if your life sucked in your own country and you didn't have a lot to live for anyway?

Well, let's dig into this. It appears on the surface to harbour a lot of the common myths shared in the hallowed corridors of DC.
Most Cypherpunks would agree that free markets are a good thing. Basically, if you leave people alone, they'll figure out how to meet the needs that are out in there and, in the process, get a few of the goodies available to us as vapors on this world. I assume you would agree to this.
That said, the question is whether American interference abroad has helped or possibly greatly hindered the formation of free markets. And I think the verdict is beocmming increasingly clear that American interference hurts free markets. Of course, there are the arguable exceptions: Post-war Germany and Japan, but these countries not only had a strong history of free markets at the time they both ahd large corporations and a rapidly modernizing In developing markets the US track record is terrible. The more we interfere and set up puppet governments and petty dictators, the result has always been the near elimination of any kind of real modern economy.
More than that, some of the countries we've been kicked out or prevented from influencing have been modernizing rapidly, the most obvious example is China and Vietnam. Bolivia is interesting to watch.
One could in fact argue that the faster a country removes our shadowy "help", the sooner they can get on their own two feet and start developing. In this light, US influence starts to look like it's on some levels designed to quash the local development of modern industrialization and perhaps this is no suprise: We don't really want the competition.
In the long run this is unsustainable, and can only lead to even bigger September 11ths.  under there and examine the substance of what he's saying.

Well, when push comes to shove I have to admit Mr Donald doesn't mince words. Guess that's what Cypherpunks is for!
As was stated elesewhere, there is sfirst of all the problem of -who- determines the meaning of objectionable. Is it the latest DC regime? You make it seem like you espouse a philosophy that makes it easy and obvious to see what's objectionable.
More than that, however, this may be completely self-defeating. Most governments are not static entities. Some will evolve or die via relatively Darwinian processes, and interference really ends up being self-defeating, or possibly far worse.
I won't belabor my favorite example of China--Vietnam--Cambodia, but it's clear to me things could have been completely different had the US not espoused blatantly aggressive policies towards China in particular. In this context a very strong case can be made that the US caused the Khmer Rouge to come to power, precisely by performing in a way similar to what you espouse. We also had opportunities to ally with China early on, and let's remember we were allies with Ho Chi Min during WWII. But all we did is blindly pursue a policy that ended up devliering precisely OPPOSITE to what you would seem to espouse. And we're doing the same thing in the middle east.

You say a lot of wacky stuff, so it suprises me that I find this pragraph to actually make some sense.
No. You've got to do more reading. Sihoanouk was in power and loosely held a coalition together. In part because he believed it and in part because it was necessary to hold this coalition together, Sihoanouk did not spout particularly pro-American rhetoric. As a result, the US/CIA backed Lon Nol to overthrow Sihoanouk. Lon Nol could by no means hold things together , so in swept the Khmer Rouge, backed by Mao and the Chicoms.
Let's remember some facts here: The US backed the ferociously corrupt Chiang regime, even helping them sack China's treasuries. The US fought China in Korea and was now occupying it. MacArthur threatened to make China a nuclear "Parking Lot". The US was in Vietnam trying to fight their way up. So it would have been pretty evident to anyone watching that the US was trying to undermine the PRC. In fact, this was also a main motivation for the Cultural Revolution: Mao wanted to move heavy industry out into the countryside, away from easy bomb-ability by the Americans. (Of course, that idea was actually used by Mao for consolidating his politcal power which was always with the peasants, but that's besides the point).
Mao did the reasonable thing and fought us (and won) in all 3 theaters. I'll agree with you pretty quickly if you say Mao was a fairly Stalinist butcher, but in any event he made use of the Khmer Rouge to push a US-backed puppet out of the peninsula. Note that only after Mao kicked our asses repeatedly did Nixon and Kissinger decide to make friends with Mao and the PRC (which was the smart thing to do all along after the Sino-Soviet split).
What if the US had not followed such an aggressive policy towards the PRC? Chinese history gives us a clear indication: They would never have backed the Khmer Rouge. (Sihoanouk regularly traveled to China before and after that time, BTW, and was moderately friendly with Jong Nan Hai.) In addition, the notion of having to hide Chinese industry from the Americans could never have been used as a credible reason for lauching the Cultural Revolution.
In the end, our policies in SE Asia likely caused millions to be killed, and in the end were self-defeating. A complete fiasco. And the same thing is happening in the Middle East.
So even if one agrees that your goals are 'admirable' (and I question that), your methods would also be a complete, unmitigated disaster.

Basically the way I see it. I've felt for a long time that the US (even while pursuing it's questionable goals) should have jumped all over the chance to buddy-up with China after the Sino-Soviet split, and knowing Mao's practicality I'd bet he could have been pursuaded (hell, not long after it was Mao and Zhou who initated contact with the US). Relations with Vietnam and Cambodia could have proceeded very differently in that environment. Would the cultural revolution still have happened? Probably. Would the Khmers have gotten into power...possibly but I actually doubt it.
But of course, we were still in the middle of McCarthy-ism, so way too ideologically blind to see the obvious. As a result we continued to mindlessly pursue ideology rather than practicality and so ended really making things worse in SE Asia, in a place where Marxism was really a useful but temporary veneer over local politics (again we were too blind to see that Marxism was a western transplant that wasn't going to do too well in Asia). And we're doing it again...(eg, we had some chances with Iran recently that we passed up...that was really stupid, and the Iranians seem to know it).

I said...

So there was no Vietnam war? The US was not involved? It didn't occur in the 60s? Are you saying that the cultural revolution didn't begin in approximately 1966? That the Sino-Soviet split didn't occur in the late Like I said: Uh...wha?
Let's put it this way: Mao and China clearly interpreted US involvement around China (ie, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc...) as having a lot to do with containing the 'communist meanace' and restoring the Chiang regime to power (we had funded Chiang and the incredibly corrupt Soongs with billions of $ during the 30s and 40s). Whether you agree with this actually constituting "aggression" or not is almost irrelevant. Clearly, our involvement in all of those areas (along with the rhetoric along with MacArthur's words which got him fired) could easily be interpreted as such.
But let's sidestep this and point out that it's the US that did this then and is doing this in the middle east. Almost no other countires can be said to be involved in a meaningful way. So is it your belief that the US is somehow more moral/courageous/godfearing than all the other countries in the world? Why is it always us (and not other countries) meddling in foreign affairs? Doesn't that strike you as odd? Is it merely a coincidence that we continue to be the focus of lots of international hostility?

Let us not forget the more tangible 'value' in bombing the WTC and messing up things downtown. First of all, the companies in the WTC were, to say the least, impacted (actually, the company I work for lost 11 people and relocated to NJ for about a year)....hitting them (and their workers) was probably not considered "collateral damage" by Al Qaeda, any more than bombing German or japanese urban production centers was considered that for the allies in WWII. Next comes the financial district and Wall Street as a whole. The third (and as it turned out by far the most impactful) was the destruction of the Telecom Central Office in  World Trade Center, along with bringing off-line the big Verizon CO across the street. These actually caused Wall Street to be knocked off line for several days, an impact that is hard to underestimate. And while I suspect that Al-Qaeda were probably unaware in advance of the impact on Telecom, the rest was certainly a conscious decision.

Who knows? If Bush & Co are able to steal this election, maybe in a year or two (after the death toll hits the 5 digit mark) we'll start hearing about how Saddam wasn't so bad after all, and why don't we give him a second chance? (We'll watch him closely, so don't you worry!)

Again, you live in a world that's evenly divided between black and white. Since I'm not white you figure I must be black.
To reiterate a point your world view does not seem prepared to understand, communism (like Whabism these days) is a fleeting ideological counter-pole to the perceived evils of America and capitalism. To make an analogy, let's say someone on the street tried to force-feed you the most healthy food in the world at gun point. There's a good chance that, after that, you will not eat that healthy food any longer because you perceive it to be "evil". Likewise with Imperliasm and free markets: The more we try to shove it down the throats of the Islamic world the more they will reject both us as well as whatever we're trying to give 'em.

If the guy's IQ had broken the 3-digit barrier he might have figured out that by nearly directly replying to the new bin Laden video he's basically elevating bin Laden to a hostile head-of-state.
OK you TLA snoops...surely some of you montioring this list must have noticed that? Where are Mr Asswipe's brilliant advisors? Isn't this kind of acknowledgement practically Rule 1 in your anti-terrorist manuals? Or do you tacitly cooperate for the sake of job security?

@_subject: Remailers an unsolveable paradox? 
Some good points, Johnny.
I'm not convinced Spam and the remailers are inherently incompatible. Or at least, I'm thinking there's a sort of uncertainty principle that should work between legit remailable messages and spam.
it may be a tricky business, but I suspect that the need of spammers to send out huge numbers of messages may be exploitable. Hell...they may in some ways be an asset if handled correctly: Much easier to hide remailed messages in larger torrents than in sparsely trafficked remailer networks.
And of course, it may be that the need to sell goods (ie, from a specific URL) means that anonymity is not so useful, particularly if there are time+bandwidth constraints on portions of the network (eg a remailer has a max bandwidth that gets throttled back if there's a large woosh of traffic in a certain period of time).
So I don't think the problem is unsolvable, but I agree with your essential point that it needs looking into.

Well, although the sentiment is appreciated, I'm not sure it's well applied in this case.
What this guy seems to be saying is that it's better to 'solve' the SPAM problem now rather than waiting for legislators to use Spam as a reason to try to shut down the remailers (and this seems distinctly possible particularly if George W makes it to his 3rd term!). I don't think the guy is looking for state-ish 'OK', but pointing out that things get a lot more difficult if/when remailers or their use is outlawed.  Like back in the day when I used to toke on a regular basis...I sure was going to keep scoring nicklebags and whatnot, but my count would probably have been better at my potstore if it were legal. (And yes, a potstore...there's tons of them in NYC with plexiglass walls and a few canned food props lying around. You stand in line and order your nickel/dime bag just like buying tokens.)
The hascash idea is OK, and obviously will work (as of now...the dividing line between human and machine is clearly not static, and smarter spam operations will start doing some segmentation analysis and then find it worthwhile to pay up). But the kind of person that may have legitimate need of a remailer may not understand and/or trust what would probably be necessary to use hashcash. And OK "that's their tough luck", but then I always feel there's safety in numbers.

The kind of regulations that regulatory bodies have made in the past are in their nature different from these secret rules I still believe. This is of course aside from their secret nature.
Previously, if a regulatory body such as the FCC enacted some kind of policy, they could fine companies that did not comply. From my naive perspective, I didn't view these regs as really having a direct impact on private citizen units/individuals, apart from their organization, but then again I could probably think of exceptions.
Hum. I wonder. Do you think these secret regulations are communicated via secure channels? What would happen if someone decided to send their own regulations out to all of the local airline security offices rescinding any private regs, particularly if one used official-looking letterhead?

I tend to agree, though that the bootstrapping process can be greatly retarded in the presence of a heavy police state....but above a certain threshold it can unfold quickly.
What I wonder if whether W and his buddies were up late drinkin' one night and figured out that we were nearing the threshold you speak of, a threshold they believed they had to save humanity from.

A solid post. In this context I'd drill down a bit to the idea of My running, personal theory is that Muslim fundamentalism (and in general, most fundamentalisms) get going when the locals gain a persistent sense that they're gettin' screwed over, and that their current government ain't helping a whole lot. It's kind of a devil's bargain to obtain a source of strength. By necessity it needs to reject a lot of the local culture, otherwise there isn't sufficient motivation to fight. In general, it's probably on many levels predictable and even reasonable.
Of course, this can boil over into bizarre, "fanatical" behavior, but then again as Mr Young so aptly put it, "fanatical" is what the screw-ers normally call mass behavior they don't like. In the case of Nukes, I'd point out that the nuclear nations have a distinct advantage at the UN or any other bargaining table, so if I were Iranian I'd be working pretty hard to get something quasi-viable together that could be called a "nuke". Of course, the few truly "fanatical" members of the local nuke-wannabees might get a hold of the block box and, well, that sucks.

I post this not as a refernce per se, but to ask the question:
Exactly Why Does the Government Not Want to Reveal Their ID Rules?
This would seem obvious at first, but upon thinking about it I have to admit to being a little confused.
For instance, is it indeed possible that revealing this rule would pose an additional security risk? If such a rule exists (and it does) then hijackers obviously already know about it. Could this rule also reveal some deeper secrets about how hijackers can be detected? I seriously doubt it.
Then of course, the argument may be that the government wanted to hide the rule for the very reason of making it more unassailable. In other words, if the rule were known, then it might be more easily contested in court. Hiding the rule protects the law which in turn protects national security.
This last idea is the only one I can think of that might be behind why the government would make such a rule secret.
If this is the case, then this reveals what I would argue to be a dangerous mindset: The government needs to protect the people from themselves...ie, from the normal operation of democracy.
On Cyperhpunks I would suppose this does not seem suprising. But it perhaps reveals that there is explicit, conscious thought occurring along these lines in the government. THAT, perhaps, is new.

@_subject: Bypassing Local Authorities 
Been thinking about something. Seems to me that the big TLAs will probably try to avoid detection, whenever possible, by even local authorities such as Police, security companies, etc...One of these could inadvertently (or 'advertently'!) tip off the observee.
I'll give you an example I've been thinking about.
Consider that someone wants to start monitoring your hotmail/gmail etc...
Of course, they could just issue some piece of paper, send a couple of guys with guns (or threaten to) and boom! A copy of all your stuff starts getting funneled over. No doubt this happens a lot.
BUT, what if they'd rather avoid that. Email companies aren't necessarily experts in hiding the fact that they have been contacted.
So it seems to me that a TLA will probably first go about trying to guess your password or otherwise crack your account.
If they're just reading your email, there's probably a number of things they can do to make themselves undetected. One 'obvious' thing is, after opening your email, is to resend it to your account using a spoofed originator. So then, we you access it, it all looks fresh and new.
The same "avoiding local detection" probably applies across the board. If they want to enter your house, they probably don't want to telegraph this by contacting your local alarm company and having them shut off the alarm (on the other hand, seems to me someone should open an alarm company where any down time is automatically encrypted and downloaded somewhere so that it could never be tampered with and is always retrievable by the customer).
There may be some interesting consequences, however, to this.

Let's assume they also are not particularly thrilled about having hotmail know what they're up to (if needs be they can obtain a warrant, etc..., but this is clearly less than desirable compared to more direct techniques). It seems fairly easy to me to (for instance) create a bot that duplicates all of the email and resends it to your hotmail account so that when you log in everything looks fresh and new. (There are probably easier ways to do this via direct hacks of hotmail).
Is there some way to make it evident that someone has opened your email?
Right now, I can't think of anything you could do aside from suggesting that hotmail (or whoever) offer some kind of encryption service.
BUT, it occurs to me that you might be able to have gmail forward your mail to hotmail via some intermediate application you've set up that takes the timestamp and whatever and creates a hash.
Now your 'observer' of course could possibly go over to hotmail and try the same tricks, but this might be harder...the forwarded emails might not last very long. this might require a pretty heavy hack into gmail or else a subpeona, in which case they are much closer to the surface than before...'they' need more resources and possibly subject themselves to the legal system, which they probably still want to avoid.

Yes, but this almost misses the point.
Is it possible to detect ('for certain', within previously mentioned boundary conditions) that some has read it? This is a different problem from merely trying to retain secrecy.
Remember, my brain is a little punch-drunk from all the Fight Club fighting.
BUT, I believe that the fact that deeper TLAs desire to hide themselves from more run-of-the-mill operations might be exploited in an interesting way. Or at least force them to "commit" to officially surveiling you, thereby (one hopes) subjecting them to whatever frail tatters of the law still exist.
A better example may be home security systems. If they're going to tempest you, I'd bet they'd prefer not to inform your local security company. They'd rather just shut down your alarm system and I bet this is easy for them.
BUT, this fact may enable one to detect (with little doubt) such an intrusion, and about this I shall say no more...

No, the threat model was outlined in a previous post. Consider some "agency" that has lots of resources and technologies, but also doesn't particularly want local authorities or (for instance) hotmail to know what they are doing. In general, this is going to make their operation much less intrusive, lower cost (ie, due to not having to physically send people) as well as avoiding a lot of legal hassles due to paper trails.
So I guess what I'm looking for is  way to be quite certain that someone (aside from Hotmail admin) is opening, reading, and closing my email Of course, once such an effort is detected, said agency may decide to follow a more intrusive investigative path, but this has practical consequences.
My home alarm system is probably a better example. If NSA, for instance, is going to bother entering your house and setting up whatever, I'd bet they'd LOVE to not bother with the local security/alarm company, because then there's a paper trail, people who might be a friend of the surveilled, and other 'local' issues. They're definitely going to use their fancy gadgets, etc..., to bypass the alarm system while making the alarm company everything's going just fine, or perhaps a battery has expired. In this case there'd be nothing to subpeona.
Therefore, if you suspect you're being surveilled, even if you can't secure anything you want might want to secure, you can at least force them to commit legally actionable acts, or else force them to give up their 'phishing' expeditions.

Eh...for email you may have a point, but I'm not 100% convinced. In other words, say they want to monitor your email account. Do you really believe they are going to tap all major nodes and then filter all the traffic just to get your email? This is that whole, "The TLAs are infinitely powerful so you might as well do nothing" philosophy. And even though I might be willing to concede that they get all that traffic, one hand doesn't always talk to the other. there may be smaller branches on fishing trips accessing your email if they want. if one were able to monitor the email account for access, you'll at least force your TLA phisher into going through proper internal channels.

Actually, I did know that 300Mb/sec isn't super-huge for Denial of Service attacks at least, but this is an "obscure" Tor node. Someone attacking it at this stage in the game has a real agenda (perhaps they want to see if certain websites get disrupted? Does Tor work that way for short-ish periods of time?)
At 4Gb/s into the router, I'd guess that router is hooked up to 2 GbEs mapped over a pair of OC-48s (Sounds a lot like the architecture Cisco has sold certain GbE-centered Datapipe providers.) Your attacker might actually be interested in pre-stressing the infrastructure in front of that router.

And since one's passport essentially boils down to a chip, why not implant it under the skin?
As for the encryption issue, can someone explain to me why it even matters? It would seem to me that any "on-demand" access to one's chip-stored info is only as secure as the encryption codes, which would have to be stored and which will eventually become "public", no matter how much the government says, "Trust us...the access codes are secure."
Seems to me, the only way to secure the RFID encrypted info would be if the owner (uh, I mean the citizen unit) releases said info via a personal encryption code, known only to the user and not by ex-welfare Gate goons. But I seriously doubt that that is what the government is "thinking about". (ie, they want to be able to read your RFID wihtout you having to perform any additional actions to release the information.)
The only way I see it making a difference is perhaps in the physical layer...encryption + shielding is probably a lot more secure than encryption without shielding, given an ID "phisher" wandering around an airport with a special purpose briefcase.

Supposedly, the tobacco companies have had commercial marijuana products ready forever (I've even seen photos, but I always suspected they were doctored up stoner's dreams).
The idea that the pharmaceutical companies would start actively researching new designer drugs is fascinating and scary...wait, scratch that "scary", because it can't be scarier than drug-related crime in the US.
The New York Times Magazine had a fascinating story years back on the US's marijuana industry. it's apparently the  export crop and US pot technology is in some cases extremely, uh, high. They described growers with strings of apartments in various US states connected with sesnors to the internet. If any of the apartments showed signs of entry, the grower would never return. (Each apartment supposedly had low levels of crops to fly under certain state laws if they were ever caught.) No doubt some of those growers are good customers of RSA products!

I recently read that a simple LINUX OS has been written in java.
How hard would it be (and would it be meaningful) to write (or modify) a Tor client that could sit on top of a Java LINUX?
This could allow anyone at a public computer to open a Java-based Tor client (from a Tor website, of course), from pretty much anywhere (though I imagine Tor-on-Java would be resource hungry).

OK...does anyone know why the NSA has such a facility out there? Not a lot of the most useful information these days is natively not of fiber plant.
I know that the area is famous for maintaining radio silence for large swathes of spectrum (I remember a radio astronomer from the area telling a story of how a large blast of radio noise was messing with one of his measurements. He drove something like 20 miles to a farm and found that a toaster or something was on the fritz.)
What I'm wondering then is whether large quantities of telephone calls are actually transmitted via satellite rather than through fiber. This would have a number of advantages over the use of standard fiber-optic transmission. It might also explain a few things too.
The first thing it could explain is why they need such a facility. Of course, such a facility might mere be an artifact from the old Soviet/Satellite days. But if they had moved over to very fiber-intensive methods, that would not be an ideal place to perform such activities.
But it seems to me that radio silence might be useful if they are receiving huge amounts of signal via  satellite. In order to support the badwidth, they'd need to use as much available spectrum as they can (probably even spread-spectrum techniques in already-occupied bands). They'd also be pushing things to the absolute maximum bitrate-wise, meaning they need as much sensitivity and highest possible SNRs as they can get.
What this also means, however, is that there must be a network of uplink stations around. Local telecom traffic is probably backhauled to such stations for literal upload to satellite (ie, rather than NSA building out it's own conspicuous fiber network).
Such stations must be easily observable, so they are disguised as something else. Actually, Cable TV uses a distribution network that might serve quite well in reverse, with the proper modifications.

Well, I agree with the general gist of this post though not it's specific OK...a Cypherpunk ultimately believes that technology and, in particular, crypto give us the defacto (though, as you point out, not dejure) right to certain levels of self-determination and that this 'right' is ultimately exerted indepedent of any governing bodies. In the end, most likely despite any governing bodies. Moreover, it has been argued (in general fairly well, I think) that attempting to exert one's 'rights' through a 'democratically elected' mob is rarely much more than mob rule. "We have voted to ransack your home." OK, that I think is well understood.
BUT, an essentially Cypherpunkly philosophy does not preclude any kind of action in the legal/governing realm, particularly when it's recognized that said government can easily make it very difficult to live the way one wants. In other words, if Kodos is promising to start curfew laws and make possession or use of crypto a crime, I'll probably vote for Kang in the dim hopes this'll make a difference.
Things get sticky when you start talking private sector...unlike most Cypherpunks I don't subscribe to the doctrine that, "Private=Good=Proto-anarchy"...Halliburton is a quasi-government entitity, AFAIC, the CEO of which 'needs killing' ASAP. In the US Private industry has a way of entangling it's interests with that of the Feds, and vice versa, so I don't see any a priori argument against establishing some kind of "rear guard" policy to watch the merger and possibly vote once in a while. With Palladium it's easy to see the Feds one day busting down your doors when they find out you broke open the lock box and tore out their little citzen-monitoring daemon inside, which they put in there working with With respect to TCPA, however, I happen to agree with you. IN particular, I think most people will put 2 and 2 together and remember that it was Microsoft in the first place that (in effect) caused a lot of the security problems we see. Watch mass scale defections from Microsoft the moment they try a lock-box approach...or rather, the moment the first big hack/trojan/DoS attack occurs leveraging the comfy protection of TCPA.

Hum...I've been thinking about that...seems to me one could set up anonymity using even Hotmail and Yahoo by a careful selection of completely improbably emails addresses. The timing might be tricky, though:
1. Think up two email addresses no one would have utilized...a random list of letters and numbers.
2. Go to Yahoo mail and sign up using one the email addresses. Plug in the other as the 'reference' and point it at, say, hotmail.
3. Open another browser to hotmail, do the reverse.
4. Hit send.
5. Hit send.
This should cause the two email accounts to reference each other. Mightn't this work? If not, perhaps there's some way to delay one of the emails.

Well, basically it's pretty simple. Someone will eventually recognize that the idea has a lot of economic potential and they'll go to Sand Hill and get some venture funds. 6 months later you'll be able to sign up for "Spam Mail". Eventually the idea will spread and Spammers, who are already squeezed via Men With Guns, will start running out of options and so will be willing to pay, for instance, 1 cent per email. After that, of course, the price will likely go up, except for crummier demographics that are willing to read email for 1 cent/spam.
Actually, this points to why Spam is Spam...Spam is Spam because it has zero correlation to what you want. Look at Vogue, etc...it's a $10 magazine consisting mostly of advertisements, but they're the advertisements women want. Pay-to-Spam will work precisely because it will force Spammers to become actual marketers, delivering the right messages to the right demographics..in that context the Price to send spam is a precise measure of Spammers lack-of-marketing savvy and/or information. Hell, if they're good enough at it they'll probably get women to pay THEM to spam 'em.

When I was in Telecom we audited pieces of an undersea NSA network that was based on OC-3 ATM. It had some odd components, however, including reflective-mode LiNBO3 modulators and even acousto-optic modulators. (Actually, one of the components started dying which put them into a near-frenzy...it turned out we had someone who happened to know the designer of that very piece and so understood the failure mode completely.)
My theory is that they were multiplexing their OC-3-collected information back over the same set of fibers the intelligence came from, or else re-routed it to another "friendly" cable nearby.
These days, however, a la Variola I don't think that a single OC-3 will do even for specially-selected traffic, so they must do something different now (unless, of course, that OC-3 was just their OAM&P/control network, which is entirely possible).

No! Undersea?
Do you take a copy of EVERYTHING and send it back? That might have been more feasible in the old days, but when a single fiber can run 64 wavelength optically amplified 10 Gig traffic, I really really doubt it. Or at least, this would require an undertaking large enough that I doubt they could hide If they select some traffic then we have to ask, how do they select the traffic? Even there the mind boggles thinking about the kinds of gear I suspect it's a combination of all sorts of stuff...remember too that all that traffic has to land somewhere, so theoretically they can access a good deal of it terrestrially. What you might see, therefore, is a sheath coming out of, say Iran, is tapped for fibers that proceed on to other unfriendly nations, and a copy of the traffic pulled back to some nearby land-based station in a friendly country (so that lots of amplifiers aren't needed).
I'd bet you do see the occasional Variola suitcase, though, requiring a sub visit once in a while. But I bet they avoid this kind of thing as much as possible, given the traffic volumes.

Well, DISTANCE makes it more complicated first of all. You need undersea repeaters and/or OFAs in order to get traffic from most parts of the ocean back to land, and the NSA will in many cases not want nor be able to use the "host" service providers' OFAs. This would mean they'd have to install their own, and I doubt they're going to just plop on their own regeneration site on the outside of a civilian cable.
Hum. In some parts of the ocean they must almost certainly have their own cable and then couple stolen traffic into it. I'd bet there also must exist some mini-Echelons on some Islands somewhere (like Majorca or the Azores) where they do some grooming and listening.

Good presentation. I liked the boot diagrams quite a bit.
Prediction (and remember you heard it here first): TCPA will fail. Oh it'll see some spot uses, don't get me wrong. These spot uses might even remain for a while. But the good thing is that Microsoft is probably going to have to carry the ball on this one, and they'll think they have a few iterations to iron out the bugs. But users will defect in droves as all sorts of unexpected and wacky things start to happen and they'll defect in droves.
Right about then even some of the studios are going to begin to understand that by choking off the spigot they'll be choking their own product flow which will have to increasingly compete with independents (who can distribute music over the internet just as easily as SONY can). So some genius will make a convincing enough boardroom presentation showing that the additional revenues they gain through TCPA is far more than overset by the effective loss of advertising. That realization will hit just as the general public starts learning what TCPA is and why their computer is as buggy and crashy as it was during the Windows 95 days.

And from there there's lots of stuff that can be done with colors and other indirect stuff such as (perhaps) camera signatures in the photo (eg, If there's text that says "Hamamatsu Synchroscan Streak Camera" then don't bother doing the FFT--it ain't a picture of your dog).

One would really need to have done the classical coursework in order to understand it (or at least to know enough to be spurised by it). And if you don't have the math then forget about it.

Yeah, but this steps crosses a line, I think. Before, your home could be taken for a public project. Now, the supreme court has ruled that your home can be taken for a "public project" that consists entirely of private development, in the name of the "public good", which is supposed to equal higher tax revenues.
What this equates to is, whoever had more money than you can take away your home. Previously, it was just the occasional men-with-guns that could do this, but now they effectively have proxies everywhere.

Well, ya' gotta a point there. Actually, I WISH I were smoking something.
But "saying" is at some point important. At least, prior to this a number of individual landholders might have been able to work together (ie, amass legal funds) to prevent the bulldozement of their properties by The Donald or whoever else's mouth has been watering recently. Now it just comes down to who can buy more guns: the poor or rich guys & their hired hands (ie, local government).
Also, it will probably end up being a kind of turning point. Now, knowing what the SC has decided, there are lots of plans going to drawing boards that have nice big fat red X's over low-income dwellings..."Don't worry about the new Brooklyn stadium, we'll just set off the ED roach bomb and clear 'em all out of there."

@_author: Tyler Durden 
@_subject: SHA1 broken? 
Ah. You meant as a principal in general. Of course the prevailing wisdom is to go from FPGAs to ASICs when you have heavy tasks.
In Telecom equipment, however, there's a few issues that basically 'require' First, the standards change quite a bit, depending on which area you're in. For instance, RPR didn't really get settled until very recently. Second, your customers may ask for "more" or different kinds of functionality, so you may have a new release of firmware to address that. Putting the framing and/or PM on an FPGA while keeping the guts (eg, packet processing) on the main ASIC/processor allows you to swap out the trivial without a major heart In addition, there's probably the far more important issue of design cycle times. ASICs will take (at the very minimum) 18 months to create, and if you make a mistake early on and don't catch, you have to start all over again. For some fields that's just unacceptable.
Then again, if you're looking for sheer, brute performance and design cycle times are not a limiting factor, ASICs are often the way to go. Even in a Variola Suitcase, however, I'd bet some of the trivial functions are off-loaded to an FPGA, though, for reasons above.

@_subject: on FPGAs vs ASICs 
The router world seems to use a good mixture. At a startup we were purchasing nice off-the-shelf MPLS ASICs, which did MPLS route setup and forwarding (and some enforcement) while the 'software'/control plane (eg, OSPF, RSVP-TE, etc...) was largely in FPGAs of our own brew.
At that time (ca, 2000/2001) some vendors were starting to push net processors, which were somewhere in between, and at the time just weren't quite fast enough for ASIC-busting applications and not quite flexible enough for FPGA-ish applications. Now, however, I'd bet net processors are very effective for metro-edge applications.
What I suspect is that there's already some crypto net processors out there, though they may be classified, or the commercial equivalent (ie, I assume there are 'classified' catalogs from companies like General Dynamics that normal clients never see). They can periodically upgrade the code when they discover that some new form of stego (for instance) has become in-vogue at Al Qaeda.
These won't be Variola Suitcase-type applications, though, but perhaps for special situations where they know the few locations in Cobble Hill Brooklyn they want to monitor and decrypt.

@_subject: Golden Triangle Drug Traffic Arbitrage? 
Hey...had an interesting idea I've been discussing.
Actually, no way it's crypto but it's certainly markets/anarchy, so read on if you wish.
I'm thinking that that Drug Trafficking in the Golden Triangle might actually be a form of arbitrage.
Let me explain...
China pegs it's currency to US currency. With the dropping dollar, this means that there's going to be a larger and larger gap between 'reality' (as measured in the true cost of goods in a free market) and the pegged rate.
On Cypherpunks do I need to explain the idea that this difference will inevitably give rise to a big black market to exploit that difference? (I had a hard time explaining this to some younger Wall Street folks here.)
An interesting though I had last night was that the Drug trade in the Golden Triangle (Burma, China, Thailand, etc...) might exist for precisely this reason...in other words, as a form of arbitrage of sorts between the actual local cost of goods and services and manpower and exchange rates of the US dollar. Heroin is an ideal medium for arbitrage, as it's price is almost a pure function of supply and demand (as opposed to cost of material). It can fluctuate with the currency markets and as a result forms  a sort of 'common denominator' for translating local wealth back into international, 'real' In other words, the drug trade is a direct result of government intervention in the currency markets.
Of course, if May were here (may his soul roast in the hell of lesser lists) he'd say this was 'obvious'...
Is it?

@_subject: Golden Triangle Drug Traffic Arbitrage? 
Hey...I never said May was an idiot. In fact, quite the opposite. His issues with race and violence, I feel, don't emanate from stupidity by any means, but are rather codifications of some kind of issues into his thinking. Get him away from "human matters" and on the technical level he was normally very sharp.
OK, I'm punting here, and I'm not an economist. BUT, my assumption is that the costs of production of heroin is far below it's actual street value. Indeed, this is why many 3rd world economies produce such drugs.
Yes, that's precisely what the drug trade does.
Well, of course. What I'm driving at, however, is that a pegged yuan (or any currency) will have inevitable and unintended local consequences.
For instance, let's say a Chinese consumer wants to purchase US goods in China. Obviously, such goods will be extremely expensive. However, with a pegged rate, the price for such goods will no longer reflect the true differential in the price of (for instance) labor in the US and China. In other words, goods are more expensive then they have to be, due to an artificial "barrier" created by the pegged dollar:Yuan rate, and exporting legitimate goods becomes a very expensive way to buy those goods. More than this, the value of a local "yuan" (or what have you) is not what it could be if you (as an individual, not a nation) had direct access to foregin capital at a rate that truly reflects the differential in costs, efficiency, etc...
So what do you do? You export blackmarket goods for prices that reflect some sort of "reality". In addition, it probably allows local producers of other non-black-market items (some of which may not be exportable) to have access to foreign capital at the true going value, via various economic relationships with drug creators, etc....
Come to  think of it "arbitrage" is not the best term.
Of course, the actual growers and even exporters of heroin are completely unaware that their livelihoods are the result of macroeconomic conditions.
Just a thought, could be wrong, but I see nothing in the response above to indicate I'm extremely off base. It's nominally "Cypherpunk" in that it poses the question of whether central control is actually responsible for the some aspects of the drug trade.

Another brilliant idea from Tyler Durden.
Has anyone heard of a utility that can search for a WiFi hotspot while driving and then launch an email?
In other words, say you want to send out a few anonymous emails, and you don't even want to enter a Cyber-cafe or whatever. So you load up the emails in your mail tool and drive down Main Street. The launcher utility detects the presence of open wi-fi hotspots and belches out a few of the emails while the spot's in range....all the while you don't even slow down.
Sounds possible to me. the only problem might be the need for authentication, etc...in some hotspots, but given enough hotspots surely there are some that don't need it...

@_date: 2005-03-25 21:52:51
@_author: Tyler Durden 
@_subject: WiFi Launcher? 
Well, as pointed out previously it may not be necessary to authenticate. If you believe you'll be passing through a high WiFi density area, and that chances are decent at least one or two of the hotspots do not require authentication, then have the app toss off a bunch of the emails and try again at the next spot. The emails should make it through somewhere (particularly in places like NYC, were there must be a dozen or more public hotspots within a block or two of where I work).
Of course, if authentication happens to be achieved, then I guess have the app delete those emails it got through.
Which leads to the possibility of perhaps attempting both strategies simultaneously, but on different frequency bands.

Interesting. Gives a lower limit to certain storage questions. Guess it's no suprise IBM's SAN product handled things here, it's been field-tested after GENEVA -- IBM and CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, today announced that IBM's storage virtualization software has achieved breakthrough performance results in an internal data challenge at CERN.
The data challenge was part of a test currently going on at CERN to simulate the computing needs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Computing Grid, the largest scientific computing grid in the world. The LHC is expected to produce massive amounts of data, 15 million gigabytes per year, once it is operational in 2007. The recent results represent a major milestone for CERN, who is testing cutting-edge data management solutions in the context of the CERN openlab, an industrial partnership.
Using IBM TotalStorage SAN File System storage virtualization software, the internal tests shattered performance records during a data challenge test by CERN by reading and writing data to disk at rates in excess of 1GB/second for a total I/O of over 1 petabyte (1 million gigabytes) in a 13-day period. This result shows that IBM's pioneering virtualization solution has the ability to manage the anticipated needs of what will be the most data-intensive experiment in the world. First tests of the integration of SAN File System with CERN's storage management system for the LHC experiments have already obtained excellent results.
"CERN has a long-standing collaborative relationship with IBM, and we are delighted that IBM is pushing the frontiers of data management in the context of CERN openlab," said Wolfgang von R|den, Information Technology Department Leader at CERN and Head of the CERN openlab. "What we learned from these data challenges will surely influence our technological choices in the coming years, as we continue to deploy the global LHC Computing

Assuming it's doable then I'm as yet uncertain about the legal ramifications. Say the smokey's are stopping you for something "routine" and you burn your stash right there. Do they have the legal right to even mention the disposal operation? And if they do, is there any legal way to state what substance was destroyed?

Something just occurred to me. It's probably trivial and known already, so sue me I'm bored.
Creating an mp3 from a known recording is actually not "copying" at all. mp3 is a lossy form of compression..."unnecessary" information is thrown away, but any audiophile can tell the difference between the mp3 and the original.
Does this mean that enforcing copyright laws basically means dis-allowing experiences similar to those triggered by the "actual" recording?

@_subject: "Copying"...what does that mean? 
Yes, I basically agree. But on the other hand, a bootleg in the old days meant braking laws regarding illicit recording of an event. (As I remember) you also broke a law regarding the copyright of the performance. Cassette copies of vinyl were a tiny bit tricky, and the "gap" allowed for copying for home use and maybe for a few friends.
Basically, this was what I was wondering. When we move from the analog domain to the digital, how does one identify the data? It's no longer a series of 1s and 0s, because I can change the 1s in 0s in a non-correctable way (which is what happens with lossy compression) and still go to jail for transmitting that bitstream.
Without a doubt, the courts have not bothered to give precise definitions to what a "copy" truly is in the digital domain. Even samples count as full copies, apparently. This means, then, that even a small sample (ie, the bitstream 0101110111) is a "sample" from something somewhere (probably practically everything) and hence could land me in jail.
Unlike some Cypherpunks, I'm more litely anti-statist: One can only claim legitimacy for a state if the laws are well defined enough so as to allow for nonarbitrary enforcement (and I only said "claim", so I don't need Of course, there are probably legal arguments made somewhere that refer to the perceived identity of a track or sample, so I guess what I'm really asking is if anyone knows what they are and if they make any sense (aside from giving big corporates the ability to whack any college student they want to make an example of).

That's part of my gist. I guess what I'm asking is, in the digital age does "copying" make a lot sense legally? OK, there are a few clear cases: If I take bitstream X and replicate every single bit precisely, that's "copying". If I take bitstream X and losslessly compress it and then transmit it (along with instructions for decompressing it, this latter potentially out-of-band), then I am "copying".
After that I'm not convinced "copying" makes any sense. In other words, if "copying" is to mean anything besides what a bunch of Men with Guns say it is (because a big fat media company told them that), then it needs to be defined clearly. And if it can't be defined clearly then the MwG are merely MwG and the more strongly anti-state cypherpunks have a new insteresting argument: A law ain't a law (in the classic sense) if you can't define it.
As I said before, if a "sample" is copying, how small a sample are we talking about? Look-->0101
I sampled Britney and that's what I got. I'm therefore copying and could go to jail. I probably won't go to jail, though, unless I eat into someone's profits or piss off individuals in the government.

Well, you'd think. On the other hand, that "Bittersweet Symphony" dude didn't make a dime off that song because the Rolling Stones are sampled in there somwhere. The "Gray Album" guy of course neve made a dime because he sample the White Album and Kill-Mo-Dee's Black Album (or whatever), which no one would ever confuse with the originals. So apparently a sample is a copy.
Now arguably, a "sample" is only a "sample" if it can be recognized (or so I'm told), but this means that "copying" is no longer a layer 1 through 4 phenomenon. However, the demise of Kazaa, et al proves that's not true either. A copy is a copy if someone with money can buy the MwGs. Or at least that's what it looks like, given the above.
Which is not to say I'm so anti-statist that I don't believe in the very concept of a "copyright". For me, however, at best it's a social convention that we "outsource" the use of force to enforce, so that it will be possible for full-time recording artists to exist. I can live with that: Society is a devil's bargain. BUT, if enforcement boils down to the local official's definition of "copyright", then it's time to fire up the CD burner.

Huh? What's this guy's fixation on -illegal- actitivty? The point is anonymous activity (including monetary) that can happen to bypass observation & control by authorities. It may or may not be illegal. The legality, in fact, is largely irrelevant once the transactions start moving through such a blacknet.
The reason this matters is precisely because we shouldn't be equating illegal activity with anonymous activity. "You're using a blacknet therefore you're breaking the law".

In many segments of the credit card insutry meatspace is also irrelevant. Anyone with a FICO greater than about 680 is almost certainly concered with maintaining their reputation with the current crop of TRWs of the world...collections efforts leverage the potential damage to the reputation, and only very gradually (if ever) fall back into actual meatspace threats (ie, docking your pay, etc...).

Seems to me there's a couple of possibilities for a TLA or someone else to monitor Tor users. Tor clients purchased online or whatever could possibly signal a monitoring agency for when and possibly where the user is online. This would mean that at bootup, some surreptitious packets could be fired The problem here is that a clever TLA might be able to hide its POP behind the Tor network, so merely checking on IP addresses on outgoing packets wouldn't work.

I don't agree.
One thing we do know is that, although Crypto is available and, in special contexts, used, it's use in other contexts is almost counterproduct, sending up a red flag so that those that "Protect Our Freedoms" will come sniffing around and bring to bear their full arsenal of technologies and, possibly, dirty tricks. Merely knowing that you are using stego/crypto in such contexts can cause a lot of attention come your way, possibly in actual meatspace, which in many cases is almost worse than not using crypto at all
In addition, although strong and "unbreakable" Crypto exists, one thing a stint on Cypherpunks teaches you is that it is only rarely implemented in such a way as to actually be unbreakable to a determined attacker, particularly if there are not many such cases to examine in such contexts.
The clear moral of this story is that, to increase the odds of truly secure communication, etc, Crypto in such contexts must become much more ubiquitous, and I still think Cypherpunks has a role to play there and indeed has played that role. Such a role is, of course, far more than a mere cheerleading role,a fact that merits a continued existence for Cypherpunks in some form or another.

The leftist Z-mag had an interesting article about Chavez last month. Although most of Z-mag's articles are fairly silly leftwing ranting, you defiintely have a few in-the-trenches-type articles that show up every now and then. The article on Chavez is most interesting and strongly suggests that what Chavez is actually doing is trying to drive up the price Venezuela gets per barrel. Apparently, he's been successful, and most major oil companies (with the notable exception of Exxon) have recently signed very favorable contracts with his government. Also of interest is the proliferation of Chinese and other oil companies edging in next to the big US & UK oil firms that have traditionally dominated such deals.
Maybe not quite bullshit after all...the major barrier to doing this (ie, shipping low cost oil to some contries and communities) was that the oil was in a form that required processing before it could be used (when I get home I'll try to look up the specifics). Only a few companies could do this and he now has such companies signed (one is Chinese, I think).
Well, that's always the catch. Mao and (to a much lesser extent) Castro were effective guerilla warriors, but Mao had to die of old age in order for China to start developing itself (Cuba speaks for itself). Chavez seems to be spending a lot of the oil wealth on lots of social services which, though perhaps noble, is not sustainable. If Chavez were bright enough to use this $$$ to kick-start a modern economy his rhetoric would then prove to be much more than hot air.
In short, I'm not convinced Chavez is an idiot. From this vantage point I'd argue it's way too early to tell.

Also, there -is- a one-to-one mapping between Tor nodes and Tor-hosted sites, no? It's not like a site is cryptographically split into quasi-redundant pieces, placed on random servers, and then assembled on the fly when there's a request, right? Can Tor support such a thing in the future? (eg, Website file A is split into N partially redudant pieces and sent to N servers...the website can still be retrieved from any M pieces, where N<=M.)

Very interesting CPunks reading, for a variety of reasons.
Of course, the fact that Lucent has been in shit shape financially must have nothing to do with what is effectively a state-sponsored protection of intellectual theft and profiting by Lucent (merely keeping the tech under wraps would have been possible in a closed-doors session. Remember that connectors can easily cost $50 per or more, so these guys were really ripped off and Lucent probably made out quite well.)
Aside from this the links are worth pursuing vz Variola Suitcase type I suspect that a thorough civilian analysis could reveal a lot about NSA's undersea operation. One thing I can see about this connector is that it does not require any visual orientation in order to mate the Bragg-angled fiber interfaces inside...other connectors either mismate if you're not careful, or require rotating the ferrule in order to get the notch to line up. (Low-loss fiber connectors are Bragg-angled in order to prevent reflections.) These might not be viable options at deep depths, indicating that some of their operation must be done extra-vehicular (though by humans or robots I can't yet tell.)
Their carrying on about HOW they select traffic is, I suspect, true: They must have some kind of control and switching network in some areas in order to select out some traffic, and I believe I've seen parts of this...the bandwidth is just too large to develop a complete 1:1 copy of everything, when we're talking middle-of-the-ocean-type applications.

That single little Wired article told me more about NSA's network than I've heard or read anywhere else.
It should be proudly pointed out that we Cypherpunks correctly reverse-engineered most of these details some months ago.
For me the main conclusion is: "They can't get everything." Not even a very powerful Variola's Suitcase could do the job. They have to do some statistical pre-sort of traffic and then route the more likely calls/etc...into NSA's own Fiber network, where backend equipment does several more layers of pre-sort to determine urgency and then perhaps store the rest.
I'd still bet that we'll see the NSA "fall back" upon the fact that humans don't actually read most of the traffic they scoop up. They probably only open up high-risk domestic communications, but by then merely knowing they have something (and knowing its source and destination) is going to be 90% as good as actually having a human read it. So this legal avenue is unlikely to put anyone meaningful in jail.
OTOH, it shows that the parastic NSA network is possibly far more vulnerable than most people imagine.

That's the key here, and not captured in the subject line. They DON'T capture everything and backhaul it, though everything probably undergoes a first touch at the POP.  What I suspect is that there are underground footballfields worth of SAS geeks down in NSA basements who apply statistical criteria for pre-sorting. For instance, if sender IP is "Mongolia" then that buckets that communication into a low-risk segment.
If there's enough "Risk" in a communication they probably decide to pull it back via the NSA parasite network where further Risk models dictate whether it gets stored or analyzed by a "higher layer". Eventually, a tiny fraction are probably analyzed by humans.
Interestingly, I'd bet we can guess as to how much gets pulled back and how much gets dropped at the POP, but it would take some work.
Another point that was made years ago on Cypherpunks is that the presence of crypto "where it doesn't belong" is probably a very high risk indicator. In other words, if your sender IP isn't some bank or big company and you're using crypto, they probably grab ALL of that and send it to high-cost The moral of this story is: Use Stego in your P2P'd Porno if you want to send anything discretely.

Depends. If you're planning on knocking over the Empire State building then even if they can't crack your code (in a reasonable amount of time) they still have sender/receiver IP as well as a host of other information.
Come to think of it, isn't the encryption length itself unencoded in the header? Even if not, if your message falls into a high enough risk bucket to merit an all-out assault, if your message doesn't yield then after a certain point they'll start realizing that you probably cooked your own and did it very well. In THAT case they probably start thinking about sending a blackbag operation into your neighborhood.

I think that's an important point too. Even moderately strong crypto is a good thing because it forces them to make choices about where they will devote their resources. Even though the Feds can "print money" at will, reality eventually bites even them in the ass. So in other words, even if they can print money they will eventually run out of paper.
That being the case, then using ANY crypto for popular apps is better than (and not equal to) nothing. Of course, the stronger the better, but those arguments that "they can break anything so why bother" are counterproductive at best and suspicious at worst.

@_subject: Disguising a Tor node? 
Well, here's where my ignroance is revealed.
But let me recall the 'threat scenario' in this case.
MwGs don't like Tor networks, and set about trying to find the nodes, and take them down. How do they do this? They can, perhaps, look at the IP addressses of packets they themselves shoot through the network, and then (theoretically) trace these back to the machines that sent the packets, presumably a tor node. Or at least, they can do this  for an exit node(s).
After finding an exit node, they can then contact the operator to locate the server and Tor node, and bludgeon them in totaking it down. The operator prrobably won't be surprised, because they will have installed the Tor node, which presumably has all sorts of files named, TOR.EXE, TOR_CLIENT.DLL, and so on. The only other way to tell they are running a Tor node is to see the other IP addresses coming in and going out, which presumably are other Tor Is that basically right?
What if, for instance, a Tor client sent out a whole buttload of IPs, some of which are Tor nodes, some of which aren't, in various cities (including, say Fallujah). Let's say also that the Tor package sent to an actual Tor node operator was disguised to look like some other innocuous service. Let's say also that there are plenty of fake non-Tor packets coming in and out of that node which don't lead to any Tor nodes at at all.
In the case, the local authorities would have to have some kind of subpeona (one would think) 'proving' to the operator that they indeed have a hated Tor node on one of their machines. They would also have to do this for a variety of nodes, perhaps, even ones that aren't actually Tor nodes.

OK, more dumb questions about hiding a Tor node.
Even though the current list of Tor node IP addresses is basically public, I'm not 100% convinced it woul have to be.
Well, exit and entry nodes perhaps have to be public, but what about nodes inside the cloud? OK, anything sent to one of those nodes by an edge node has to use a unencrypted IP address on the packet header, right? BUT, the same machines that house the Tor nodes could (and probably do, right?) house other services as well...a packet sent to the Tor node has to be sent to the right socket and layer 4 service. Right? And THAT can be encrypted, and probably already is by Tor nodes. (Now remember I'm not a datacom guy...)
If the list of interior Tor nodes is encrypted and only machine-readable by other Tor nodes, AND if we have a few additional  services residing on the same machines as the Tor nodess, then a packet sent to a machine housing a Tor node may or may not actually be going to a Tor node.
If the operators of that machine are also unaware of the precise service-bundle existing on the machine (not unreasonable as long as someone is paying them for the consumed bandwidth) AND if packets destined for that machine can reasonably be said to be accessing a non-TOR service AND if the IP address list of interior TOR nodes is encrypted, is the Tor node now disguised? Seems to me it would be difficult for some  authorities to track down the location of some Tor nodes.
Or am I missing something? Like I said, I'm no datacom guy, but hiding a Tor node deosn't seem impossible to me.

@_subject: [declan@well.com: [Politech] NSA surveillance: EFF lawsuit; 
Seems to me we have much more than that.
NSA may be able to tap optical cables without AT&T knowing (or with them looking the other way), but in general that's not the way they're going to eavesdrop. The only way they can cost-effectively get the access they need is in the electronic domain, and there's little doubt in my mind that they merely asked for certain traffic to be dropped-and-continued onto NSA gathering points.
For one, there's just no way they'd be able to deploy a duplicate optical network that backhauls all of the relevant traffic to NSA facilities.
They can't even secretively grab individual DS0s and backhaul them without cooperation. Optical span + EDFA noise budgets will first of all prohibit this (ie, it ain't good if your tap brings down an AT&T cross-country OC-192: 3 dB matters to optical amplifiers). Second, to have ready access to any DS0 in the country is impossible without help. Consider even a single 128 wavelength optical cable carrying OC-192 on each lambda: they'll need a tap, a 128 (optically amplified) DEMUX, an OC-192 SONET terminal for EACH wavelength and some way to grab individual DS0s (or maybe they just take the DS1). And THEN they have to backhaul that somehow.
And that's just one cable.
It's just physically impossible for them to grab everything and backhaul, of that I am convinced. My assumption is that EFF folks in the know already know this. They might have even just picked AT&T nearly randomly...any of the big long haul carriers will have had to collude, and probably didn't even seriously consider not colluding.

I actually strongly suspect Vodaphone cooperation in this.
"Seeding" a remote software upgrade to a switch like this is extremely difficult if you're coming in from another vendor's gear. Right now I believe they would've had to gain physical access and install the software in person, otherwise they'd have to go through the local Greek NOC.
I suppose it's POSSIBLE they modified the Vodaphone software and remotely seeded it without anyone being the wiser, but what? No one noticed a bunch of DS0s were all of a sudden provisioned with unknown traffic?
But no doubt they had copies of the gear, no doubt they had access to the firmware code, no doubt they had telco gear coders (something that's practically nonexistent in Greece right now)...
If you ask me, Vodaphone's playing dumb in light of EFF suing AT&T. They realized there's no way they code hide that if someone was inspired to start looking more closely.

Yes...I thought about a one-time pad approach. I'm not well read enough to say whether what I've described technically counts as a one time pad, but it seems to have many similarities to what you're talking about.
A "weakness" is that if the "message" is intercepted and deencrypted, the interceptor (is this Alice?) could then retrieve the message.
HOWEVER, they must retrieve the message in a short amount of time, possibly even hours, UNLESS Alice & friends can core-dump the entire probable network and, somehow, (later if they wish by appropriate Network Clock monkeying) find within it the stored other pieces of the message. I suspect that this problem can be made intractable even to Quantum computers, but don't quote me on that.
No doubt they've thought of this scenario, so be on the lookout for little hooks. Another nice thing is that they CAN'T always rubber-house it out of you: Even you can't get it if they've beaten you're keyboarding hands so badly you can't access it within the alotted time. (Of course, the "message" can tell you how much time you've got before the other network-clouded pieces expire).
Oh, and the usual games of fake messages should apply, but in this case there are some advantages to having some universally. network-enabled "default" messages. (And if you hit one of -those- messages, the real message should be destroyed automatically.)

Alif the Terrible wrote...
Yes, agreed, but I think this a MUCH bigger pain in the ass.
To wit: If they grab and deencrypt the "message" (ie the piece sent to the receiver) prior to the expiration time, then they will have the message and be able to read it. This is an improvement in that they have to do it prior to the expiration time of the hidden piece. They can not grab and store this piece alone because the other piece will not be there later.
If they do not deencrypt the message in time, then they have to grab a core dump of the entire network (as well as the transmitted message), because they do not know where the piece is located. Seems to me that's a much harder thing to do then merely grabbing a sole message and de-encrypting it at their leisure. Seems to me too that a Tor network that was sufficiently dynamic could require network core dumps that could actually tax even NSA facilities, given large Tor networks of the future.
It should also be pointed out that if the encryption on the "message" piece is done extremely carefully, one can afford to be lax on the Tor piece, and yet have a very difficult problem to crack (particularly if wrong guesses set off boobytraps that kill the hidden message piece).
Again, it can be countered that an attack might merely require N instantiations of the network, but now we are talking some very significant resources. We've multiplied the originall cracking problem by N. Perhaps.
PS: I believe this is very close to having a one-time stored pad, but the difference with traditional Pads is that this one is tored in an anonymous location.(See Coderman's post.)

I sincerely doubt that all of it can be.

Possibly, some of it will get routed through here (I say 'here' because out my window I see one of the big NYC COs). But if that's the case, look for very high bandwidth cross-country optical systems deployment with many wavelengths and lots of Raman as well as traditional optical amplification. Akin to what Corvis was building until they merged into Broadcom (hum...that's interesting if you think about it).
I also happen to know enough about how a lot of the long-distance telecom networks are setup, so I also doubt they'd want to backhaul that through NYC if they're in the beltway, or southish like that.
Then again, it's not impossible, and there can be very strong Operations reasons for moving traffic like that.

By this I assume you don't mean through buffer overflows or exploiting obscure bits of cluelessness. You mean "brute force", but (obviously) through the use of algorithms we Spy-ees aren't aware of.
I'd say that's absurd paranoid thinking, but on the other hand...
1. There's been no 'proof' per se about the intractability of factoring, 2. Seems like the Feds veryu suddenly gave up fighting encryption a few years ago. I assumed this was because of the rapid rise of electronic transactions and communications, but maybe...
3. We never discover anything that makes us realize that the factoring problem is a lot HARDER than we realized....every few years there's a small inroad made here for this kind of prime factor, another discovery there and so on that renders RSA fairly trivial for certain categories of primes. Given several footbalfields' worth of well-payed encryption talent working for several decades, seems to me they could certainly at least be ahead of the civilian world in this area (silicon chip fabrication is another issue entirely, however).
Is this correct?
If the statement is true (ie, 'NSA has been able to crack RSA...'), it's not necessarily the end of the world. I'd bet that it's still potentially VERY expensive on average, though the scary thing is that some messages might fall apart easily. In fact...a search for a subtle and inexplicable steering of the prime space used by some implementations would be telling. Am I talking out my ass here?
Another interesting thing is that it almost doesn't matter. Buffer overflows and other indirect attack are such that one should consider a lone encrypted message sitting out there like a sitting duck painted bright red. Better still to paint that duck white and stick him in a bigass flock. In other words, it might make sense at this point to regard RSA as crackable and then rethink how to hide the significance of encryption itself...

Here's some more details.
So...does this amount to trespassing or merely arresting two guys for running traffic you don't like?
This also implies that CALEA probably isn't even necessary in a lot of cases. NSA can probably surreptitiously copy and route traffic to themselves through intermediate networks.
Come to think of it, this may imply that something like CALEA is far easier in the packet world than it was in the circuit switched world.
One implication is that VoIP can't really be secure unless we can hide the routing and not just the pakcet contents, but of course this isn't a new problem as recent events a la NSAT&T prove.
Two Charged in VOIP Hacking Scandal
JUNE 9, 2006 | Federal authorities pressed charges Thursday against a second man who helped perpetrate a VOIP wholesale scheme that defrauded at least 15 VOIP service providers.
Robert Moore of Spokane, Wash., also known as the "Spokane Hacker," was served papers Thursday but had not yet been taken into custody, according U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Michael Drewniak.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey had filed charges against Edwin Andres Pena, who they say set up the allegedly fraudulent wholesale business -- called Fortes Telecom Inc. -- in 2004. (See 'Free' Skype Could Be Costly.)
After charging his service provider customers cheap rates to route their calls, Pena's company secretly routed the calls over the IP networks of at least 15 VOIP providers, according to court documents.
This was done using a two-step process.
Step One. The men obscured the origin of the calls by sending them through an "intermediary." The feds believe Pena, with help from Moore, scanned the networks of companies all over the world looking for network ports to use for routing calls. The New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office said it obtained records from AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T - message board) showing that, between June and October of last year, Moore ran more than 6 million scans for those susceptible ports.
The two eventually decided on routing calls through a router owned by an unnamed New Jersey-based hedge fund company. (See Ingate Secures VOIP.)
Step Two. With a "blind" established, Pena then needed to gain admittance for his customers' calls to be routed onto the networks of other VOIP VOIP providers tag their own calls with a unique identifier or "prefix" so they can be admitted to the network. Pena allegedly bombarded the VOIP providers' networks with test calls -- each carrying a different prefix -- until he found one that was admitted to the network. He then tagged all his fraudelent calls with the winning prefix.
Having penetrated the networks of VOIP telephone service providers, Pena programmed the third party's computer networks to use the illegally obtained proprietary prefix to route calls of customers of his companies, federal authorities say.
The Pena case will certainly revive the issue of security among VOIP providers. Many in the VOIP community are all too aware of the security perils of running calls over the Internet. "This hacker's approach is certainly not a surprise to those in the Internet community who follow these types of issues," says Brian Lustig, spokesman for VOIP provider SunRocket Inc. . "It is just another variation of fraud that can be perpetrated."
So what does the VOIP community intend to do to protect itself from hacking? "The industry as a whole -- including Sun Rocket -- is already hard at work on standards and security measures that can prevent this type of activity," Lustig says.
Pena was taken into custody today and was scheduled to appear in court Thursday. Moore will appear in court soon, Drewniak said.

And when the individuals in AT&T, etc...agreed, didn't they have some kind of documentation to show that "They told us to turn over the records and we thought we were required to".
What I suspect is that they don't have anything that looks like anything more than a request.

I'm intrigued, though slightly sceptical. As each packet passes through the router buffers, then any inter-packet delays would be erased. However, I suppose it's possible that he either inserts additional "silence" packets between legit packets in the flow, or else remaps the packet payloads and so inserts said delays.
One "good" thing here is that this will probably be very difficult to do en masse...they'll have to target a specific individual I suspect. Also, I would think it's useless with mere email, etc...
But of course, if they already have you on their radar screen and you are trying to hide the identities of people you are communicating with, then they MIGHT be able to figure out who you are communicating too.
Another good thing is that I suspect it's possible to develop a counter to this (or at least detect it), but it may overburden some TOR nodes.

I'd bet by the time this post reaches the list most Cypherpunks &c will have already seen the string of information posted on Wired and other places, about AT&T's network. This is a level of detail that I strongly suspect has NSA folks shitting bricks:
Here's an interesting quote:
Now this is REALLY interesting:
OK, this means the 16 fibers mentioned above are single wavelength. From this document we can also view what the actual bandwidths are: OC-12s and OC-48s, a couple of OC-3s and no OC-192s. Now I don't see any documentation stating that there isn't more than this going into the room. The "four splitters at a time" almost certainly implies that this traffic is coming off a 4-fiber BLSR (most likely too NSA worked with the other carriers to move the traffic to protect prior to installing the splitters).*
Theoretically, they could actually just backhaul all of this traffic using pretty ordinary 16 wavelength WDM from any number of vendors. Getting that cross-country is difficult, but with ULH (Ultra Long Haul) this could be done with a relative minimum of repeater/amplifier sites. If they pre-sort the traffic before backhauling it they could then actually just buy a wavelength on AT&T's backbone, which has some nice features to it (I'd bet they also have their own encryption used for the entire wavelength pipe, though I could be wrong).
The pinchpoint here just might actually be the deep packet inspection. Does anyone know what kind of bandwidth the narus boxes can support?
What this will do is give us an idea of how much traffic they are actually taking back. From our discussions some months ago, I have assumed (and still believe) that they can't grab EVERYTHING and pull it back, because that would require too obvious and too huge a network. My other assumption is that the narus deep packet inspection is enforcing a prioritization prior to hockeying the most "juicy" traffic into their fiber or wavelegnths.
*: They would have first told the owner/carrier of one of those OC-N pipes to force a switch to protection bandwidth while they installed the splitters, and then switch back once the splitters were installed. It LOOKS like they did this ring-by-ring, diverting traffic away from the "break" and then installing splitters on all four fibers terminating across the break.

@_subject: QWEST 
Another thing to note from...
Is that Qwest owns one of the pipes coming in to the AT&T "Secret Room".
When the optical splitter was installed Qwest would have definitely noticed an OC-12 Protection Switching event, given that they were not informed prior to the event.
Now the possibilities are these:
1. NSA went to Qwest in San Fransisco and informed them prior to the event (probable, I think).
2. AT&T went to Qwest and claimed to be testing the link and that they should manually switch their BLSR traffic over to protect (possible).
3. No one said anything to Qwest and Qwest thought they had a PS event.(Doubtful, but it would work for NSA).
If 3 occurred then they would have certainly communicated with AT&T about the PS event: This is not trivial, even though the outage would have lasted between 10ms to 50ms, depending on which architecture that traffic dropped out of.
In any event Qwest will have recorded the event and will still have that event listed somewhere.
I'd certainly like to see how they viewed it and what the communications

Well, I suspect they do a lot more before inspection, and use a statistical model to trigger whether the actually grab and backhaul any piece of "Obviously", Source and destination country will matter, then within the US source and destination IP address (eg, knock into low-risk bucket if both source and destination IP correspond to Citigroup, even if one IP is within Saudi)...application is obviously going to matter, presence of crypto (and possible "crypto depth") and all the way up to L7 including key words.
Clearly, this policy is going to be risk-model driven and will undergo periodic changes (implying too that NSA has their own LAN by which they download new policies remotely into the Narus boxes). It would be "nice" too if their models fill up their available backhauling bandwidth.
Now that just determines what traffic gets backhauled. It's a big vacuum cleaner that grabs as much as they can within requiring that they build a completely duplicate optical network. After that the traffic gets pulled into the Beltway (most likely) where further models probably determine whether the traffic gets stored, read by humans "now", or whatever.
Note that by this time having a human actually bother to "read" an email or whatever is not necessarily important, even if it's encrypted.
What this means (to your point) is that merely building better crypto is only one axis to protect your privacy. If your communication gets as far as the Beltway and human examiners (or possibly gets shot down to their subterranean cracking farm) then you're already "of interest". With good enough crypto it's -possible- that you can thwart their attempts to actually read your email, and that's good because it forces them to decide whether they want to expend the big $$$ and risk exposure for a field operation.
But the other axis is statistical (as you point out). It's far better to never get caught in the NSA driftnets in the first place. This means stego, this means P2P (hum...what if I had a P2P video of a document I wanted to transmit...NSA wouldn't be able to read that document, right?) this means (somehow) encouraging more crypto in more places so your traffic doesn't stick out.

@_author: Tyler Durden 
@_subject: NS&AT&T 
Most likely no. From the context of the circuit order it seemed pretty clear that this was all active traffic. These were the fibers that were opticall tapped. Also, BLSRs (Bidirectional Line Switched Rings) support "extra traffic" that gets bumped during a protection switching event, so the protect bandwdith wouldn't even be idle (though the routers would probably throttle down when they sensed less bandwidth).
Interestingly, though, from your chart above it looks like they probably have a router and an OC-192.The odds of all of these pipes being full of packets at the same time is probably very small, so maybe they can indeed grab everything.

Yes...it's VERY interesting to consider how they are transmitting those policy updates. Clearly they have a LAN. Does it use dedicated bandwdith? (eg, it's own GbE, for instance) are they in-band with other traffic? (ie, a tunneled VPN inside a big GbE?) or are they leveraging some of the unused SONET DCC-ish overhead bytes?

Well, how out of band? Do you mean the management VPN (or whatever) doesn't travel with the actual grabbed traffic? (Frankly, this would be my first candidate.) Of course, they could do it via SONET overhead bytes, thus avoiding the flakiness and vunerability that routers and switches still seem to have.
One wonders too if they do anything with SS7.
Of course, they could have a dedicated fiber for their management LAN, but due to latency issues &c I would suspect that can't be a LAN all the way across the country...they've got to Long-Haul the management traffic somehow, which implies packing it into a 100BaseT or whatever and then shipping that out either packed in SONET or with other circuit-switched traffic. Or of course, they might just have their management on something like STS-3C POS, and the rest of their OC-48/192 carries real traffic.

There are plenty of unused bytes in the SONET overhead, particularly at OC-48 and OC-192 (in fact, most of the line and section overhead is empty because the overhead bytes are only defined for the first STS-1! Not a lot of people know that).
The problem, however, is that Line and Section layer overhead will be terminated pretty much every time they pass through a SONET box. There's the possibility of using the POH for control and management traffic, because that -should- stay with the payload. In terms of visibility they could of course encrypt those packets, possibly even using off-the-shelf VPN of they run a short stack management channel (though 7-layer/OSI is not impossible, given the old fondness for it in standards groups for so long).
On the other hand they could possibly just go in-band and send the management info with their backhauled traffic, but I'm still a little doubtful about that.

This nice thing about TOR-stored data and services is that it would be well-nigh impossible for interrrogators to know in advance that they won't be making the canary sing. In fact, depending on the nature of the data stored, it could be set up to be irretrievable without a message going off.

I'm not convinced NSA is in a position like that. If DC is saying, "Get whatever you are able to get and we'll worry about whether it's legal or illegal after we see what it is."
NSA individuals may give something of a crap about some of these issues (or not), but in the end NSA is merely another engine, as it were, a big Janitor that gets information that's normally hard to get.
In other words, NSA's priorities reflect those of the State, and the State is, invariably, looking to keep itself in business.

@_subject: Status of opportunistic encryption 
Another thought.
Even if everyone else doesn't encrypt, are their opportunities to "crypto load" some services with useless, though encrypted information? Of course, the loading can't make the service useless or even notceably degrade, or it won't be available in the long run.
For instance, it seems to me that for some P2P services, it might be very useful to constantly encypt and then "share" biggish files, even if no one can actually de-encrypt the file. If the bandwidth of such encrypted files is reasonable (though not a degrading % of the network's bandwidth), then that service becomes a useful channel for transmitting information that's actually encrypted, otherwise the one PGP-encrypted file that gets sent through Kazaa or whatever is like a red cow standing in a sea of black-and-whites. It's arguably less secure than not encrypting (ie, they -might- not be able to read the text, but they damn sure know that this sender/receiver is very interesting).
Actually, this may notbe too hard to acheive through something like Kazaa. All that would be needed is N "bots" that "share" a steady stream of encrypted files with each other.
Of course, it's far better if they do some kind of identity-hopping somehow, or perhaps sit behind a wall of anonymity.
But this doesn't require encouraging everyone to encrypt.
In other words, if you've got a needle you want to hide it's far better to plop some bigass haystack on it.

Huh? You're good at coding-type comments, but from my limited brain you seem to have missed his main point. Can virtual-world economics impact/sink real-world economies? That's not entirely obvious to me. Or at least, it's by no means intuitive. Remember too that this is just ONE game here. Soon, there will be thousands, many of which may not even exist long enough for taxation to be enforced. And indeed, that might drive some worlds to become very temporary. And what if the exchange rate is no longer to USD but for, say, CPU time or disk space or gold or silver? Tim May's ghost will be leaping for joy. (Oh wait: Tim May IS Tim May's ghost.)
In fact, the only way for such an environment to be reliably taxed is for the feds to tax every computer interface that links to the net, and it's just too late for that. Or perhaps, the Feds will just grab a slice of every transaction that exits a bank account, irregarless of where it's ostensibly As far as I'm concerned, these are just tip-of-the-iceburg issues here. When we start considering trans-world untaxed (ie, not by real-world governments) digital coinage then things become unclear very quickly (and despite the existence of trans-world exchanges, these are still closely bound to the USD). Oh, and it seems obvious that if these online economies keep growing, some of the game operators will want a tiny tiny slice of each transaction, which may drive them to make games free just to get the discount revenue.
But his essential points stand, even if the specific implementations suggested aren't yet feasible.

@_subject: Preconfigured hidden service 
Don't know i this comment has been made this-go-round, but I have long argued that support for the 'clueless' is actually well within the bounds of Cypherpunk concern.
Of course, traditional Cypherpunk theology (a la Tim May) is that we shouldn't worry about the clueless. If they can't set up a Tor Client then fcuk 'em: If I'm not clueless then my communications can be made secure.
To this I'd offer the following argument, stated elsewhere but summarized here. This argument actually does not contradict the traditional cypherpunk dogma (if such can actually be said to exist), but acknowledges certain 1. Although the mathematical basis of the big encryption algorithms may be sound (and it's been argued by the less-than-clueless that some healthy doubt could be cast on this claim), practical implementations can be made fully secure only through a vast amount of effort that encomapsses computer hardware, firmware, software, and the encryption algorthims themselves, not to mention brute-force attacks than include binoculars and tempest-like surveillance. Thus, any one instantiation of a Platonically secure encryption standard should be regarded as less-than-absolutely secure.
2. Although current implmentations may be less than completely secure, it seems reasonable at this point (given media information) that it is still possible to make a communication secure enough to eat up fairly expensive resources. In other words, they may have the ability to crack just about any single message, but it seems very doubtful that the abiliy exists to grab and crack EVERYTHING. In other words, increasing PGP lengths may not ensure security, but it most likely increases COSTS.
3. Assuming any single message is probably crackable, given enough time and money, it behooves the clued to reduce a message's 'risk profile' as far as possible. In other words, it becomes desirable to remove any easily detectable signs that a message is encrypted or even interesting. This reduces the likihood that it will be swept up and either stored (for cracking later) or given high-priority status through TLA networks.
3. It would seem evident from the  above that, even for the clued, it behooves them to accept the need to increase the volume of as-secure-as-possible encrypted traffic, mindful of the fact that 'easy' implementations may actually not be particularly secure, or not secure enough for use by the sufficiently clued. However, as the volume and encrypted strength of traffic increases, it becomes all the more difficult for any one message to get flagged. (I would suggest that this is the real problem that the TLAs are faced with in the information age: They can't keep up with the traffic and must do more and more prioitization at the 'edges' of their network, thus the whole AT&T fiasco.) Most likely, TLAs have to manage to several bottlenecks, another key one being the last resort cracking farms or messages that have resisted penetration through any other means. The cost per message cracked here is probably quite high for very secure mesages. Ideally, one would like as much possible traffic to qualify for this, so as to force as much edge prioritization as possible.
4. Perhaps it is needless to say, but it is probably unfair to try to pin usability on any one technology, such as Tor. However, as suggested below, the value of Tor to all users increases with increased usability and reasonably secure traffic. Thus, I would suggest that it is well within May-sian Cypherpunk orthodoxy to encourage usability for the clueless (or the simply busy), mindful of the limitations (and threat scenarios) that such usabiliy might reasonably be constrained to.

In an information age I'm just not convinced that pricing anything on some old commodity is really a very good investment.
I'm wondering instead if there's some 'scale invariant' way to price processing power as a commodity. Of course, it gets cheaper by the minute, but perhaps there's a way to price '1 minute of latest generation Intel chip computing cycles' or something.

Well, Citigroup uses something called a 'Hobbling Terminal', which is basically the office suite in a sandbox.
But remember that a Java machine is far more than a virtual terminal, and I doubt many users of the future would even understand the difference between a machine as we know it and a Java machine. And in many places a Java machine will be far cheaper than a quad-core windows box (where 75% of the processing is used for Microsoft anyway).
Why does one ever need to leave the sandbox? Basically to run games. But in the US PC-only games seem to be fewer and far-between these days, as the big game consoles take over. In other words, the computer as we know it will be a Java machine (and likely not have windows inside it), and the console will absorb the games (and Windows) and maybe play DVDs too.

They basically just show how the LGXs are connected and interface into and out of the "secret room" via splitters.* It does say that a buttload of traffic is being split and sent off to NSA equipmet, but the real missing piece is just how that traffic gets back to NSA. I still believe that they just can't send back EVERYTHING, and have to have several layers of prioritzation, so that only fairly interesting traffic makes it back in real time (this is not to say that they don't possibly route and store uninteresting local traffic for future reference) but they can't get everything back to, for instance, DC in real Another question I've had for a while is how they get around the loss budgets in certain cases. Dropping a 3dB splitter into an OC-48 signal that's pushed to the limit will result in some signficant BER degredation. Do they just avoid those signals? DO they put in some kind of in-line optical amplifier? (That's not trivial, as they have to electrically power such a device.)
*: On the other hand, the existence of splitters alone proves that this is not standard CALEA, so when the case broke this was significant. But technologically it's not all that interesting nor surprising (for 'paranoid' Cypherpunks, at least).

Well, the need for optical amplifiers is not so much a power availability issue so much as a complexity issue. If one has dozens or hundreds of fibers, remember that each of these is going to be some random wavelength in the 1310nm or 1550nm band: You won't be able to use a single optical amplifier to amplifiy multiple wavelengths: You'll need one for each fiber.  So now, you need the space and the manpower (not to mention electrical power and heat dissipation) to handle a lot of OFAs.
Now I wouldn't be suprised if there existed a VERY small in-line EDFA (erbium-doped fiber amplifier) that could operate on a smalll amount of power (perhaps battery?) and just hang off the end of a splitter. No, they would obviously incorporate the WDFA into a 'powered splitter' (such a thing has to eexist now that I think about it).
But the trick would be to lower the number of fibers needed to tap and then hope that most of those are operating more than 3dB above their floor, and then if you have to split and optically power such a fiber.
This implies a level of prioritization even prior to reaching the 'secret So what can that Narus box do? Layer 3/4 seems obvious. Layer 7? Can it detect the presence of encryption? Can it detect the type and strength of encryption? Can it detect the existence of jpegs, mpegs, mp3s and so on? Does it support routing protocols? So, could it handle an instruction like:
If the source of the packet is located in Brooklyn
If the destination is a cave in Aghanistan
If encryption = YES,
Then route to NSA...
If destination is Kebab King in Jackson Heights
If encryption=NO,
then route to Local Storage

Well, this barely counts as WAN! My expertise increases exponentially as you get to the core.
However, I do happen to know a small amount here, and the issues are numerous and tricky.
Let's go for the main question:
Well, basically yes: It's called PON (Passive Optical Network) and there are several flavors. The original was A-PON, wherein a home-based ONT that sits on the outside of a residence outputs ethenet into the home and maps the packets onto ATM over OC-12 upstream (as I remember) and OC-48 down. It's a weird technology in that a single OC-48 is split lots of times (32, I think) and each ONT just grabs the ATM VPI that corresponds to its owner (upstream is even weirder: All of the upstream ONTs time their burst-mode output so as to glue together a single coherent OC-12 upstream).
The real winner here is probably going to be GPON, which is basically an optically split ethernet. Each ONT is given a 'window' wherein it can broadcast upstream packets. I'm not too in touch with this technology, but I'd suspect a single GbE port on the headend switch/router can support 64 endusers. And often, these endusers can be an apartment building with a switch in the basement. If you only have a single fiber coming out of the headend, then the 'obvious' upgrade is to use Coarse-DWDM which can easily provide up to 16 cheap wavelengths. In other words, that's 16 GbE ports (no, the PHY is not quite the same as the GBICs have to be burst mode).
BT and other big companies have been building out fiber-to-the-home architectures using PONs, and I think I've heard prices quoted for the ONT as low as $250, but I could be wrong.
Of course, there are  lot of people who don't like PON, and depending on how much fiber you've got in the nieghborhood and the quality of the copper in the last mile, PON might easily not deliver as much bandwidth as a hybrid Like puzzles? Play free games & earn great prizes. Play Clink now.

See my previous post. As for ATM being 'obsolete', well one might say this with good reason, but not because it isn't used. The core is still dominated by ATM. Waitaminue, not just the core but the edges too: DSL is basically over ATM still. As for bandwidth, that isn't a problem for ATM, though it's easy to bitch about the mapping penalties incurred by putting packets over ATM cells over OC-N.
On the other hand, having the ATM layer in there can complicate matters, and you don't need a lot of flow control if you're willing to give everyone globs of bandwidth. For both of these reasons and more G-PON is probably going to win out, and I'd suspect prices have already started to drop Need a break? Find your escape route with Live Search Maps.

Shee-IT. Layer 4 packet inspection at OC-192 is kinda surprising, but Layer 7 at OC-48 is for me the more difficult thing to swallow.
This has interesting implications in terms of where they place one of these Another thing worth thinking about is the control channels they must use to update the policies to one of these boxes. It's obviously in-band. One wonders if one could tap one of the fibers and find the packet stream they use to program one of these things.

Hum...it's interesting to think about this. I assumed the control channel would be in-band for several reasons, all of which may be wrong.
Let me first of clarify, in case it wasn't clear: I'm talking about downloading the policies that will 'program' what the Narus box looks at and how it will respond. The Narus box itself likely needs it's own control channel to upgrade its own software and do OAM&P, and this will probably be over the SONET DCC overhead. But the policies itself, I think, could be in band. Consider:
1) The Narus box already does layer 4: Since it's already opening up the STS-Nc container and reading the packets, seems trivial for them to grab their own control stream out of that.
2) Depending on the architecture, if the packets are in-band then they don't need to worry about getting their control channel terminated by putting it into SONET overhead. Of course, the path overhead might actually survive untouched the whole way, but that would prevent them from terminating at an intermediate router (which they might want the option to do so as to prevent backhauling a whole nation's worth of traffic).
3) Although not a BIG deal, if they used SONET overhead they would have to put their channel into unused overhead bytes. Some chipsets do that, but it's a constraint better avoided for various reasons (including rare interoperability issues if someone else along the way is using the same bytes for something).
I don't understand the comment about bidirectional transport...this is necessary anyway, no? At least the DCC of SONET NEs need bidirectional or the SONET router (yes, there's a tiny OSI router inside SONET SEs) will declare the DCC down. Or maybe I misunderstand you...
Of course, some of these considerations go away somewhat if NSA simply backhauls all the traffic over a proprietary coast-to-coast optical network, which is not inconceivable.

I keep pointing out that, given how easy it would be to blow up the midtown tunnel, for instance (never mind just taking a backhoe out into the middle of nowhere and digging up a fiber sheath), the very fact that we don't see stuff blowing up all the time is proof that there really aren't that many terrorists out there. In other words, on 9/11 we lost a solid % of them.
As a corollary, if a person is smart enough to get into the US and then be able to sustain themselves economically (never mind go to college or graduate school), the desirability of blowing oneself up goes way down.
This means then that it probably gets pretty easy to run out of legitimate TERROR! to investigate and protect us poor, terrified Americans from.

OK, basic question (I think)...
Let's say I have some kind of stored reputation or identity that communicates with the outside world.
Let's say I am able to access the server that this identity is stored on securely, and I do so for the purpose of updating information, etc, that I want to share with the outside world. (Let's assume the sharing process is gated my either me or an autonomous process running on that server.)
What is the protocol for locating and updating my identity on that server without anyone else being able to determine which identity I am accessing? Let's assume that I always initiate a session from the same IP address, and that the identity is encrypted. What I don't want is for anyone to see that "I" always access identity No. 268.
In other words, observers know...
1) I use this service
2) Many others use this service
3) One of the identities visible to the outside world is me
But what I don't want them to know is which identity in the outside world is Is this even necessary? Am I in effect protecting against someone taking a core dump of the server, or are the issues more significant than this?

But I definitely don't want a user to be able to extract private info without paying for it, and perhaps there's some info I never want released Now, having my admin not know who I am (or which reputation belongs to me) is even better, and hopefully would be solved via the same mechanism.

It should be noted that this behavior may not be the result of hyper-fascist feds, but incompetant ones: There's a apparently a huge backlog of applications because of the new laws requiring a passport to travel...everywhere outside the US, so they may be looking to push off as much as they can.

@_subject: Wikileaks: NSA funding of academics 
That's pretty interesting.
During the Variola debates concerning how much NSA could actually backhaul, I
made the point that some a lot could probably be ascertained by looking at
what NSA was funding publicly.
For example, by looking at NSA funding of burst-mode optical networking, one
could infer that NSA probably has a significant gap in terms of what they WANT
to grab and what they actually can grab and backhaul (plus, there are certain
fundamental limits to optical systems that would lead one to conclude
something similar). This, I believe, is confirmed by what was revealed about
the NSA "secret room" in AT&T's CO in the Bay Area.
Arguably, a well-done and perhaps trust-based wiki could wiggle a lot of out
what NSA is involved in, but of course there'd still be huge gaps. On the
other hand, in some areas (such as chip fabrication) I think it's getting safe
to say that NSA can't be more than one generation ahead of existing
fabrication technologies, if at all. Thus, one could make some accurate
upper-bound statements about capabilities and add that to the known funding.
Does NSA fund stuff just to avoid precisely this type of reverse engineering?
I'd bet they do, and learned to do so during the soviet era. But I also
suspect it's possible to sniff those out too.

Well, now it's time to start developing the kinds of tools discussed on
Cypherpunks back a few years ago:
Using one key yields one set of data (ie, the dummy data) and using the real
key yields the true data.
Of course, there needs to be a way to hide the data such that one can't tell
if there's another key.
And now I'm thinking that data should start being stored on the other side of
a Tor network or other similar wall: A key extracts data from one source but
the real data is somewhere else entirely. In any event, there is no encrypted
data for interrogators to see prior to receiving what the interrogated gives
them, and no way for them to know if that's the 'real' data.
This sounds like you don't even need to do much for this to be true.

Like, wasn't 9/11 big enough for them to spill the beans on what they could

prior to 9/11 were actually leaks from NSA.
For them to be monkeying around in those big leagues in such a way that it
could matter, they'd have to be visible in the markets...I think. Then again,
with dozens of shell companies all trading biggish volumes, they could
possibly make it look like no one company was consistenly guessing in the

And then of course, maybe they aren't shell companies, but having mucked about

There's been lots of net speculation about maliciousness, but for me the odds
of 3/4 failures of undersea cables in such  a relatively  small area and over
such a short amount of time is extremely suspicious, particularly given how
robust such cables are. (ie, there's maybe a dozen in the whole world at any
one time, over millions of route miles).
Whether these are JbT-type terrorists is, I think, doubtful given the revenues
traveling over these things and particularly how  ineffective the cuts were.
The cuts certainly appeared to me to be attempts to get a working+protect
sides of fiber rings by people who didn't have access to that level of detail
about how the rings are deployed over the wavelength/fiber/cable pairs.

One of the things to notice is that these are fairly shallow waters in

That said, these cables are not easy to break, not even by large boat anchors:
The cost of fixing a less engineered design would rapidly make it worthwhile
to ensure they can withstand a LOT, and they can. So I think it's worthwhile
considering who has the ability to do this sans clever tactics.
I was actually surprised to hear that two cables in close proximity were
broken and considered that not a coincidence. After three the pattern was
becoming clear.

Actually, tapping terrestrial fiber optic cable is easy: a 3db splitter will
do it, though that introduces a break (which isnt a big deal: sonet/sdh rings
will recover within 50 ms, in general).
Its also fairly easy to introduce a tap that doesnt introduce a break, and
this doesnt require spookish equipment at all:its kind of a
hand-grip-looking thing that clamps onto the fiber and pulls some of the
optical signal via cladding-mode coupling.
Either of these methods introduce at least a 3db loss, which in many cases
will just be assumed by the fibers owners to be some of the usual cultprits
that cause loss, or simply a poor splice by the truck guys.
Once you introduce optical amplification, however, its eavesdrop city and you
can tap out some signal without the loss being evident to even OTDRs.
Tapping an underwater cable is far, far harder, but the NSA is known by fiber
guys to have at least two of the very expensive and very specialized subs
At Bellcore, I actually consulted on some undersea project by the defense
department, who were seeing intermittent losses on their underwater
something-or-other, which they never told us. But, it was obvious that they
were operating an OC-3 network via their own optical fibers, which I strongly
suspect sat alongside or even inside the underwater cable. They probably had
periodic stations to look for interesting chunks of traffic that they could
tap (or electronically copy) into their own network, which Ill take a wild
guess was probably ATM over OC-3, which would make sense for several reasons,
including reach, which is critical in that environment.
In this case, though, I dont think its us JbTs, just because theres too
much business at stake.
I suspect we have some new mode of fiber optic mujahadeen that are trying to
hurt or seriously fuck up money flows into the middle east, but dont quote me
on that. How did they do it? Dont know, but remember they were resourceful
enough to figure out how to turn a 727 into a very effective smart missile.

No real ruminations are needed on these subjects: They're known and by no
means secret.
Regenerators are mostly gone now, both on land and undersea, replaced by the
optical fiber amplifier.
Undersea cables carry electrical power through a lining in their sheeth.
An OTDR can't see past a traditional regenerator: The fiber span is
terminated. (It also can't see past an optical fiber amplifier because of the
isolators that keep the ASE from lasing inside the amplifier.)
Tapping an optical fiber is absolutely trivial, more trivial than tapping a
(copper) cable carrying an electrical signal. This isn't inside inside
knowledge, even the guys in the trucks know it.
Tapping an undersea optical cable, however, is a completely different matter,
and it's VERY difficult, though routinely done by NSA, etc...
Undersea cables do occasionally break, but the net-quoted statistic of
approximately 12 breaks at any one time throughout the world is entirely
misleading: There are millions of route-miles spanning the Atlantic, the
Pacific and everywhere else. This means that the odds of three or four breaks
in a small area are practically zero. They are designed to be extremely
resilient, and this design choice has been quite successful. A simple anchor
(even from a large ship) is not in general going to cut a cable.

Basically, if a conspiracy is out in the open, who gives a sh*t? Whether 9/11

The difference between an encryption key and the key to a locked drawer is
that the drawer may be smashed opn while the encrypted file might not be
smashable at all.
Again, one wonders if a truly deniable form of TOR-based encryption might be
possible. If I enter key number one, message one is retrieved untraceably from
the cloud. If I enter key number 2, message 2 is retrieved instead. The tough
part is that there needs to be a mixed middleware service layer inside the
cloud that can take the requests in an untraceable manner and go to the right
place to retrieve.
Or is there any easier way, given ISP records of customer activity?

@_subject: Matt Blaze blog entry about NSA warrantless wiretapping 
Well, one argument I'd bet had been ridden and will continue to ride under
Obama is that there is no eavesdropping unless a human actually listens in.
In other words, given that there's a giant vacuum cleaner, the first port of
call for that traffic is almost certainly some kind of keyword processor.
Traffic of high risk probably passes through successive layers of technology
until there's a decision to actually put a human ear on it. But the telcos
probably don't need/want to know the conditions under which a human is
actually invoked, and can deniably state that they were unaware, when they
gladly ripped out a copy of the traffic, that NSA, etc...was actually going to
break a law by having a human listen in sans warrant.
As a result, it's safe to say it's still occurring, though probably not in big
fat bundles and dedicated rooms. Back in the digital domain (as opposed to the
more obvious splitting out at the optical layer), it's easily possible for the
traffic to be routed in such a way as to grant the telcos complete plausible
deniability (eg, by leveraging CALEA in clever ways, or by merely grabbing
copies of protect traffic in UPSR rings).
Of course, this raises the spectre of the (impossible) Variola Suitcase,
meaning they probably have to do a lot more pre-filtering and dropping then
they would like.

one's reputation is damaged for seven years. Commercial cards are the same,

As the population increases and physical world collateral goes to zero, seems
to me the only thing many humans will "own" is their reputation: Their
physical world assets will be uninteresting or negligible. Is this the same
thing as anonymity?
Of course, many folks will have many reputations and will choose to burn one

I think there may be large and possibly enormous volumes of traffic now
flowing across private-ish P2P networks, many or all of which will be
reasonably darknettish.
Of course, the crypto isn't perfect but I don't get the sense that NSA shares
a lot with FBI, but the sheer volume may be enough to worry the latter....who
knows what's mixed in that traffic? Who knows which of the files are actually
real or which are fake to cover covert transactions and whatnot.
Come to think of it, this may actually be a good scenario: Large volumes of
computationally difficult (but not intractable) encrypted traffic presenting
standard law enforcement with more than they can handle while meanwhile the
NSAs of the world with the resources jealously guarding their capabilities and
secrets, only sharing them in the most extrme of circumstances.
Seems to me a lot could be done inside those P2P networks. In fact, anything
needing very significant security could be hard-encrypted and then injected
and subsequently encrypted again with less secure methods with the rest of the
P2P traffic...this has the advantage of hiding the strength of encryption and
avoiding special notice from the outset.
In other words, "we" may not have won but the filesharers were driven there by
their own inevitable logic.

@_subject: Alleged Wikileaks Use of P2P to Siphon Documents 
I noticed that certain descriptions of the Wikileaks extraction of P2P files
tried to link this form of extraction to "hacking", particularly as some of
those files were extracted via surreptitious P2P. Of course, this was an
attempt to throw up some dust and create a plausible scenario under which
Wikileaks could be accused of actively obtaining the files. (I've seen some
other attempts to suggest that Wikileaks paid Manning for the files).
Meanwhile, I haven't yet seen an indictment or anything here in the US. Did I
miss something? At this juncture, is it possible that they just can't find
anything convincing enough to indict Assange or Wikileaks with?
I still say hooray for Wikileaks, hooray for Assange. Did he do it for his own
personal glory? Hell yeah, but that just further proves he's the Rock Star(TM)
of the Cypherpunks.

@_subject: Question about (cypher)Twitter 
Well, say for instance you're in Iran or Tunisia. You want to keep up with
where protests are occuring or where the JBTs have recently been seen. BUT,
said authorities somehow obtain a list of subscribers to that Twitter feed and
go chase them down. If the tweets can somehow get routed into a TOR-ish cloud
and then pass through some service located therein, it could be made
impossible for the authorities to find where those Tweets are going.
Of course, as twitter is an American company, you could argue that in Iran
they would not be able to get ahold of a such a list. But consider it possible
(through various means) for them to obtain such a list. That list, then,
becomes veritable gold insofar as it lets the authorities know who a large
number of troublemakers are. (Of course, this could never happen in the US
where civil liberties are so highly respected.)
RSS is OK, better than nothing, but in many situations (ie, with dumbphones or
where conditions are rapidly changing), a pull model has some distinct
disadvantages to twitter's push model. Or am I missing something? Seems both
real time as well as anonymity are hard to do in this context. (I'm assuming
that if a twitfeed is sent to an RSS-iator, then authorities could see that
and then find who is subscribing to the RSS.)

@_subject: New Yorker article: Enemy of the State 
Anyone read this?
I'd say it verified much of what was discussed on this list some years back,
about the likely approach by NSA to get "all" the traffic.
Of course, getting "all" the traffic would have required building a 1-for-1
fiber optic network, which I think we agreed was beyond even the nearly
infinite budget of NSA. Instead, they had to push the trafffic through
successive prioritization gates, throwing away a bunch at the edges, and the
sending the higher priority stuff through to the beltway. It would appear from
the article that the original approach had machines tagging likely traffic
needing human review, and that they originally intended to obtain a
(perfunctory) warrant for traffic both ends of which belonged to US residents.
But they apparently dispensed with the warrant formality and instead sent high
priority trafffic direct to immediate review, and stored the rest of it.
None of this, of course, is a surpise. We figured it out from fairly
straightforward principals. But what Wikileaks has shown us is that the main
problem with transparency is that it makes obvious their pathetic and
incompetent mangement, and it makes obvious their strong desire to obfuscate
their incompetence. Indeed, the persecution of the whistleblower is (at least
from the perspective of the article) not so much a punishment for revealing
state secrets (which were pretty obviously illegal), but instead revenge for
exposing the unneccessary cowboy management of the NSA during the post-9/11

Actually that's a really good point. Even I've been lulled into accepting
being surveilled as the default. "Oops! We accidently grab all of the traffic
coming from your device! Sorry about that!" It's like falling up, and it
didn't even occur  to me to be more than slightly peeved.
Damn. Soon I'll be arguing whether routine anal probes at bridge and tunnel
crossings are actually necessary.

John Young wrote...
"Never trust a security expert for they an incapable of
knowing the full consequences of what they are advising

and promulgate the faith."
It's amazing what you see in financial circles. Though I've never claimed to
be an IT security jock, I easily know enough to know that practically no one
I've ever heard talk about the subject seemed to know -anything- about how IT,
security, or even risk management work.
I've asked things like, "What ports does s-ftp use?" And gotten completely
blank stares or fudges, such as, "depends".
I keep thinking that it would be interesting to send an (encrypted?) message
between bank HQs with a subject such as, "The horrendous losses we'll be
announcing next week" and see if the stock either drops or is shorted
big-time. I'd bet that a thorough investigation reveals NSA or other TLA front
organizations doing the shorting.

And Julian, of course, is in the Ecuadorian Embassy.
One can only imagine the kind of pressure being brought to bear (bare? I
dunno) in the UK government that they would threaten (or pretend to threaten)
some sort of violation.
For that matter, why in hell did they even send token support into Iraq? The
only thing I can figure out is that they fear American consumers somehow. I
just can't imagine why the reasonably sensible British would seem to bow and
scrape to Amerikkkan pressure. With Assange, it's just a damned extradition
order to Sweden for God's sake. What the F is going on here? Are USA-ian TLA
bigshots taking Assange personally and calling in all and every favor?
Let me hereby officially proclaim (within the Cypherpunks Governance manual)
that Assange is a fuckin' rockstar. Yeah, you know every rockstar is in it for
the glory and chicks, but he's still a fuckin' rockstar.

Julian Assange = King of the Cypherpunks. It's official, because the King of

Basically just a test of the Al-Qaeda node.
Anyone been reading the recent books on Cypherpunks? I haven't read Julian's
yet, though interestingly it's not available directly though Amazon.
Greenberg's book is good and plenty of unsurprising coverage of both Young and
Through both tribs I suspect there will be an influx of young, hot tail. Too
bad no one's around to work 'em over a bit.
