"The Machinery of Freedom" far from being published in the early '80s
was published in 1971 and is based on writings from the late '60s.
It is very much aimed at 60s alternative types a with relaxed writing
style, anti-drug law and pro freedom line.
This book when I read it through FCS in the early '80s convinced me I was a libertarian.  I didn't come across cypherpunk theory until much later and, when I did, I saw it obviously followed libertarianism.
I am sure Friedman was well aware on how technological advances could
weaken the state and to accuse him of "copying" is facile.

@_subject: SOFT TEMPEST (fwd) 
I wasn't impressed.
That main tent was an old circus tent and was huge with enough room for
one thousand people.  Unfortunately it had the effect of focusing and
amplifying the already excessive heat on the sweating and dehydrated
victims sitting in it.  By the final day an attempt had been made to
open it up a bit more and to spray cold water on it.
The first thing I saw was a demonstration of the "Van Eck effect".
The idea was to pick up the screen display of someone's monitor at a
distance to read the information off it.  The lecturer was a German
professor and spoke heavily accented English.  He was very much as a
German professor might be shown in a film.  He spoke a lot about "Ze
Incriminating Emissions", which seemed rather funny at the time.
He had an aerial, which looked like an unconvincing Dr Who prop,
attached to a standard TV.  The circus tent atmosphere led somehow
to the impression that he was a stage magician performing tricks.
Also the audience's habit of cheering after each trick didn't help.
On the target PC screen were a few words in a very large font and he was
able to display this up on the TV.  He also put a device around the power
 supply lead and could pick up a better picture this way.  There were
mutterings from the audience, many of whom seemed unimpressed.  At the
question session the poor chap got a rather hard ride.  The gist of it
being "What we have been shown is twenty years old, there are modern
digital techniques that are much better".  His reply was "They are very
expensive and we have only just got the equipment and the results aren't
finished yet."  The counter measures were Tempest shielding.
In short if your password is visible on your monitor in letters three
inches high and there is a van outside your office with a large aerial
and German plates this might mean trouble.  Or maybe the NSA can pick
 it up anyway from America using the "newer techniques".

Although I dislike, as ever, Tim's tone in these matters he has, as he

In a basic course that purported to teach "economics" (actually a
dumbed down blend of vague sociology and Keynesianism) the majority of
students were foreign and had a poor grasp of the English language.
The level of debate was poor and the lecturer had an easy job.
I am not racist against foreign students and think poking fun at poor
English isn't constructive (they generally speak English better than I
speak their own language) but there seems to me something basically
broken about a system which doesn't teach basic English _before_ trying

The Real IRA has been formed by hardliners leaving PIRA.

A quick google search seems to show that there *was* looting in both Germany and Japan as those countries collapsed much as you would expect in a power vacuum.
In the German case much of the looting and rape in Berlin (of around 100,000 German women) was committed by invading Soviet troops in early May 1945.
There was German civilian looting in Frankfurt, at least, and probably "Battered in Allied advance on Berlin, Frankfurt, the third largest city in Germany, becomes a city in ruins - German civilians go on an orgy of looting, pillaging freight cards and coal yards"
As for Japan:-
The diversion of military funds and supplies into private hands actually began the day before the emperors broadcast [of surrender] and unfolded in several distinct phases. It was later estimated that approximately 70% of all army and navy stocks in Japan were disbursed in this first frenzy of lootingand this for a force of some 5 million men at home, over 3 million overseas.
  He clears up the mystery, once and for all, about what happened to the untold billions of dollars worth of war materiel, supplies, and goods that vanished immediately after the surrender; it was stolen by Japanese men of position and privilege, as Dower calls them, with the help of Japanese authorities.

I think you mean public key based authentication.
I doubt memory is likely to be an issue with this since decade old DOS
handhelds ran PGP 2.x fine and if you google for "palm pilot crypto" you
will find 2000 vintage ports of OpenPGP and OpenSSL.
The Palms do have fairly slow processors so checking keys may take a while
and generating them probably quite a long time.  More modern PDAs such as
the Zaurus or iPaq have processors which are an order of magnitude faster
and run linux so PGP (or GPG or whatever) should work.  Also the new
generation of mobiles which run Java are probably the future once the
standards settle down and the phones become more reliable.
I can see little point in trying to use shorter keys which would be a very
broken solution to a probably non-existent problem.  People should be using
longer keys rather than shorter ones, since most of the news about short key
lengths isn't good (google "DJB RSA").
It's more a software issue than a hardware issue.  It's not much of a
software problem since RSA can be written in a few lines of code.  If you
have a high level language running on (or compiler) for the hardware then
you can easily port open source crypto.  This is probably a safer solution
from a security aspect than relying on potentially backdoored or legally
restricted chipsets.
Suitable hardware has been available for 10 years or longer with a lot of
publicity for the Java ring  and iButtons about 5 years back.
It's possible the US Govt. uses iButtoms but I would very much doubt it's
used much in production.
State agencies tend to be *very* conservative with authentication and rely
on physical identity cards, individually issued (and revocable) PIN numbers
and the like.

I have had jobs as a "software engineer" in the UK and since the dot com bubble this hasn't been an uncommon job title.
The UK tends to follow US fashions very closely importing in titles like CEO and CTO and the term "software engineer" is no different.
As for your comments that "my impression is that India has a few excellent institutions and a vast number of unbelievably bad schools" I suspect this is true but applies equally to the UK and USA and indeed any country with a university system.  Neither is graduating from a top engineering school such as Stanford any automatic guarantee of quality as anyone who has worked with these people knows.
India has an excellent tradition in mathematics and some of the best software engineers I have worked with in the UK have been Indian graduates, since it's the most enterprising and highly qualified ones which tend to emigrate.

What to call people who write software is problematic.
"software engineer" is a job title like "programmer" or "developer" (often with senior or junior as a prefix).  Senior meaning that you get paid a little more since you have more experience rather than being a manager. I never had a programming job where the language was specified in the title.  I am talking here of permanent work rather than contract Searching on jobserve (the main UK IT job site) I get
3123 hits for developer
2009 engineer
806 software developer
803 software engineer
766 programmer
201 software programmer
So programmer is the unpopular job title not engineer, probably because it seems to have a bit of an outdated 1970s punched and magnetic tape type reputation.
Any Americans care to comment on this?
I think people can still get a good education even in unstable and poorer nations.  You don't need to spend many dollars to run Linux and print out downloaded PDFs. There were campus deaths in the American and French student riots of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Oxford and Cambridge Universities openly sell masters degrees.
The examinations systems in many British influenced countries in the east resemble 1950s UK ones in their high standards and there doesn't seem to be much doubt that British examinations have been dumbed down since the 1980s to improve pass percentages.  It doesn't seem to me likely a doctor's son in Bangalore is automatically going to get a worse education than the average street kid in South Central LA or Hackney.
The Asperger enhanced asian engineering, physics and maths geeks shut in their rooms with an internet link won't be the ones running around killing people.  They are more likely to be hacking NASA via abuse of their local inband trunk signaling and gaining an excellent education in C buffers, UNIX and international telecommunications systems.
