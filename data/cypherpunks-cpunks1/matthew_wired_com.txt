@_subject: Clipper Brain Pick 
Here at WIRED Online we are working on promoting awareness about the
Clipper debate. Hence we are looking for suggestions regarding resources,
online and otherwise, that we can either post or reference in our online
spaces. Below is a list of the resources I have a list of already. If you
have suggestions for things to be added to the list or things to be omitted
from the list please send them to me  Thanks.
