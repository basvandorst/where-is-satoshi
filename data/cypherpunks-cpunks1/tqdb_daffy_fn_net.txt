I think what they are really saying is that they would love to
bust most hackers, but since they can't they might as well use some of
them to catch the bigger fish.  If they truly did believe in the laws they
are supposed to uphold they wouldn't associate with hackers (who commit
computer crimes) at all.
    This is exactly one good reason for having additional support for our
Hack The Lies (HTL) project.  Besides spreading truthful and factual
information to the public, we recognize that the government definately
could use its share of help from people who know what they are talking
