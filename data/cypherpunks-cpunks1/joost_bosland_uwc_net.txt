Could you please send me more information on the press conference of
December 20, 1944, at which according to your website
) Roosevelt denied the existence of the Atlantic Charter? I'm looking at
this aspect of
European/American history, and if Roosevelt indeed denied this, it is worth
some further research.
Yours sincerly,
