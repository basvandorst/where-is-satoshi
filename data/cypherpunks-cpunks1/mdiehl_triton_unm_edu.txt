@_subject: PGP help and comments. 
I am really learning to love PGP, and I haven't even used it much yet! I'm insisting that all my friends get keys.  But....
I would like to set up two secret keys for myself.  One 512 bits long and another 1024 bits long.  I'll distribute the short one.  I'll give the long
one to trusted and close friends.  I'm having difficulty setting it up so that
pgp defaults to using the short key to encrypt stuff.  Note that I want the same user id for both, but perhapse with a "secure" flag in the user id of the
large key.  How can I do this?
Can we get someone to compile and distribute pgp for the amoeba, er, I mean
Amiga? ;^)  My friend has one, but no C compiler.
Some suggestions for future versions...
Is there any chance of pgp cloaking it's ascii armoured output to look like
uuencoded data?
I would like to use pgp on the mainframes, but don't want to store my secret
key on their disks.   Would it be possible to have pgp accept it's secret key
via stdin.  I could do an ascii upload of my secret key and never expose my
key to disk-storage.
How about password protecting pgp itself.  No one could use my copy of pgp unless they knew my password.  And only my copy of pgp could decrypt my secret key.  Just a thought.
How about a -wn option that would wipe the original file 'n' times.  Like pgp -wen10 very_secret_stuff cohort.  That should keep even Big Brother from
Is it possible to have pgp develope a third key that looks just like a regular
key except that when it is used in place of your secret key, it produces  an
alternate plaintext.  This way, if Big Brother "requested" you'r key, and
you needed to dissavow all of you'r messages, you could exchange the third key
for you'r secret key.  When someone used this key, they'd get some insulting
message that may or may not have been the original message...and there'd be
no way of knowing.  I kinda doubt it on this one, but wouldn't it be nice!
Geez, have I really gone on for 40 lines?  Sorry about that, but any comments?
Hope to hear from you.

I am the writer of the original post, and I quite agree with the responce that
said that this was a bad idea.  The whole point in being secure, is being as
secure as possible.
You still have to store a secret key somewhere.  And to do that, you must trust

It was suggested that I keep my public keyring on the mainframe and use it to

Hi all.
The manual for pgp ver. 2.2 says that it can encrypt a file for receipt by
multiple users, pgp -e file user1 user2.  I can't seem to get it to work.
It creates one file, readable by user1.  I'm using the msdos version.

is, given the proper motivation, couldn't "and entity" sniff out all of this information and find out which machine a particular message came from.  And from logs machine, which The Entity  naturally has access to, It could
find out who send the message.  Just wondering.....

I'm having a philisophical problem reguarding when to sign someone
else's public key.       Obviously, if you watch someone generate a key, and they physicaly hand
you a copy of it, you should sign it.  Fortunately, life has been this good
to me about 5 times.  But what if life isn't so good?
     Lets say someone emails me a key and the return address matches that of
the address in the key.  Do I assume no one is spoofing me?  You have to
admit that this is possible albeit unlikely.  What good is key certification
if it only "probably valid?"  I've noticed that many of the keys on the
server are signed with the same person's key.  I doubt that these people
have had physical contact with each of the people who's key that they've
signed.  Am I just being paranoid, or is there a valid issue here?  I
welcome any of your comments.

@_subject: xor data hiding? 
I heard something interesting which made me think. (gasp)       I heard that if you encrypt a file with the xor encryption alg.
multiple times with different keys, you get an encrypted file with a
coorisponding effective key which has some interesting properties.  The key
in such a system would have a length equal to the Least Common Multiple of
the lengths of the original key.  So, if you used keys of length
1,2,3,5,7,11,13, you would have an effective key-length of 30,030 bytes!  Of
course, you could use more than one 5-byte key if you wanted, and some of
the bytes should be greater than 127.
     Not knowing any better, it occurs to me that given a 30,030 byte key,
and the task of finding the original keys that make it up, (if any)  I'd be
out of luck.  It would seem that "factoring" this large key into smaller
keys would be a tough job...perhapse almost as hard as the factoring problem
in a finite group?       Brute-force and known plaintext attacks are possible, but lets forget
that for (just) a moment.  If someone DID find the required 30,030 bytes
required to read your massage, you could just as easily show them another
30,030 bytes which would  decode the message into the U.S. Bill of Rights if
you wanted to.  You could keep such One Time Pads laying around your hard
disk if you wanted to...in zip format, perhapse.  You would always be able
to get the true plaintext by simply knowing the 7 key-words.  But few others
would be so lucky.  The point being that there would be some degree of
plausible deniability with such a cypher.       For the sake of arguement, lets say that the plaintext was first
encrypted with some strong crypto.  Then we used the xor crypto with 7 keys. It would be pretty hard to see what had been done.
     Now we deal with the brute force attack to get the original keys.  Lets
say that someone does get 7 words which will decrypt your ciphertext into a
plot to distribute  to ?  If you
had to, I'm sure you could reverse engineer a completely different set of
keys which will form the same plaintext.  If you absolutely had to, you
might be able to come up with 7 words which will decrypt your ciphertext
back into the Bill of Rights, thus giving you absolute plausible
deniability.       As far as known plaintext attacks go...well, we hope that doesn't
happen. ;^)
     Well, I'm about to wrap this up.  Some time ago, I proposed hiding
messages on the end of other files such as executable.  Well, if we pgp
encrypted a file, then xor encrypted the result with 7 keys and stuck that
on the end of 4dos.com, which is over 64K BTW, I find it hard to believe
that you would be caught readily.  I haven't had time to investigate the
harmonic qualities of such a cypher, but it seems feasible.  You could
delete and wipe the encryption program from your harddisk. (after uploading
the source/executable to your local bbs)  There would be tough times for
anyone who had to pin a given message on you.  Well, what do you think?  I
hope to drum up as much discussion here as with the "radical paranoia"
thread, from which I learned a lot.  Well, I promised to wrap this up, so I
guess I'm done.

@_subject: Relation between number theory and cryptography 
According to hfinney at shell.portal.com:
Well, you may have placed an upper-limit on the amount of information in an
encrypted message.  I will try to place a lower limit.  Consider the case where
there is less information in the ciphertext than in the plaintext.  Clearly, in
this case, there is no way to retrieve the entire plaintext from the ciphertext
since we no longer have enough information.  So we have to have at least as much
information in the CT as we do in the PT.  If I bought your original arguement,
I'd have to say there is no net change in information content.  Unfortunately,
I don't buy your arguement.
What if we were to add some noise in the process of crypting the PT?  If we did
it algorithmicly, we have added some kind of information to your CP, totally unrelated to the actuall message.  But nontheless, it is information of SOME
type; it may simply be 0xFE if the message was writen in the daytime or 0xAC
if not.  This is information in a very "uncompressed" form.  Strictly speaking
this is only 1 bit of information encoded into a byte, but the net result is a gain in information content in our CT.
I don't know, is there a flaw in my reasoning?

Since Cypherpunks write code, I thought it might be interesting to find out
what kinds of systems cypherpunks USE.  If you would be so kind as to fill out
the included questionaire, I'll summerize.  Thanx in advance.
What kind of system do you use?
What OS do you use?
What mail reader do you use?
Which online services do you use?
Do you use pgp?  Which version?
If you use a personal computer, what communications program do you use?

Actually, I've implimented much of this in telix, using it's (C-like) script
language.  From the command line, I can type in the name of a batch file.  That
batch file starts telix, logs me in, sends any mail I have created/encrypted on
my machine, and downloads all my new mail, to be read from another batch file.
My mail reader batch file uses pgp to read my mail and presents a nice message
selection menu, too.  Totally transparent, and automated.  I'm quite prowd of
it.  The only thing to do is clean it up a bit, and impliment reply-quoting.
That should be done by the end of the week.  If any one is interested in what
I have.....ask me.
BTW, I have had a few bug reports on my pgp menu batch file for 4dos.  I will also have it fixed by the end of the week and will release it next week.

...other good stuff deleted...I read mail at 2400B.
If we are talking about an off-line reader, this is solved by a trivial filter
routine.  If you want to do this on-line, well it might take time.
Why save the plaintext?  I keep it in cyphertext and decrypt it on demand.  And
when I want to reply, then I decrypt it, quote it and have the user edit that file, which will presumably be re-encrypted.
Actually, these are the same problems in different clothes.
These last 2 paragraphs describe almost exactly what my scripts do!
I find that I need to be a bit more modular with my scripts so that I can call
a different module depending on which type of system I'm on...Working on it at
this moment.

According to nobody at shell.portal.com:
I've gotten a bunch!  I'm storing the messages in a file which will later be edited.  Then I'll tally everything up.  Expect results on the list monday.  Of
course this means that if you haven't replied to my poll, you need to do so by
saturday night, mountain time.
Well, now I will describe how I send/receive mail on my system, the killer
8086-8 from Hell! ;^)  I've been hyping my setup on this list for about a month.
But since I've partially implimented a system like what we have been discussing,
I'll give more details.
First, my system configuration:
MACHINE: AT&T 6300 PC HARDWARE: 640K, CGA, 1-360K fd, 1-20M hd.
OS: PMS-DOS 3.1 and 4DOS 4.02
COMM PROGRAM: Telix 3.15
As you can see, I am developing for the low-end computer......  ;^)
My email system is composed of (basicly) 2 files, a telix script, and a 4dos
batch file.  The telix script, at the moment, assumes it is already logged into my unix account.  Then it does a 'frm' command and finds out how many NEW messages are
in; it would actually be easier to simply dload all of my messages, but this is
a bit more usefull.  Anyway, it dloads them one at a time onto my pc using zmodem.  Once on my machine, the script extracts From: and Subject: information
from the message.  Then it finds a unique filename to give the new message.
This information is then stored in a form usable by the batch file, later.  After it has done all this, it quits elm, and does some housekeeping.  At this
point, the communications program is finished and the mail is on my pc ready to
read.  Under an automatic implimentation (for, say a pay-as-you-go system) this
can be done without any human intervention.
After the messages have been collected, I, of course, want to read them.  To do
this, I run the mail.bat program.  I am then presented with a menu allowing me to Create, Encrypt, Send, Read, Delete mail.  Create, Encrypt, and Delete are trivial and don't lend much to this discussion. Read presents a menu of messages from the data file created by the telix script.
At the moment, when a user selects a message to read, I use pgp to view it even
if it is not encrypted.  That can be fixed later.
To send a message, you first have to have a file containing the message, duh.
The user is asked for the name of this file, the address of the recipient, and
a subject to use.  This is information is then stored in a form usable by a
third telix script.  Ok, I lied, there are 3 files needed by my system. ;^)
The actuall sending process is simple.  The telix script reads the message information and starts elm, supplying the address and subject when asked.  Then
when it gets into vi, it ascii uploads the message directly into vi.  This may
seem kludgy, but it is rather portable since almost every online service lets
you enter a message into an editor.  Overall, the system works pretty well.  I've still got a few bugs, mostly speed-
related.  But there is room for a lot of improvement.  Here is what I would like
to impliment.
I'd like to have "encryption detection" which would allow my system to use the
appropriate decryption software for message reading.  If a message isn't coded,
it should use list.com.
I'd also like to expand "encryption detection" to recognize several types of encryption, pgp, pem, ripem, des, my-bitchin-crypto, etc.  The telix script
could tag the message as it s dloaded.
I'd like to be able to use the system on many online services.  The telix script
could check the phone directory to see which system is it on.  Then, when any
system-specific stuff has to be done, such as starting the mail program on the
host, a special function can be called to do that function on that host.  The
ascii up/down loading is fairly constant, and the local file manipulation doesn't depend on the host.
At the moment, I am working on a Reply function.  I know how I'm going to do it,
I just haven't done it yet.  More later.
Well, if you have followed my this far, you either crazy or interested. ;^)  It puzzles me why we are contemplating writing our own comm package when so many good ones are out there that can be made to serve our purposes.  I'm open to
comments.....  Fire away!

According to Eric Hughes:
Well, this is a problem with any nontrivial program.  But a script has going for it several very high-level constructs.  As people use any software, the
author will undoubtably have to improve it.  So, what is the difference if
he has to improve a script or a comm program?
That's why we have scripts in the first place!  Scripts' main purpose is to automate things.  How is this different with a comm program?  You still have to
remember how to use it....

Making it adaptable is what I mean by "cleaning it up a bit." ;^)
Telix is "user supported software."  Registering it costs $39.
I remember kermit's script language as being kinda messy...  At the end of this
message, I will include a portion of my, uncommented, script to compare.  Also,
kermit is (I think) restricted to one xfer protocol, which may not be a good
Well, either way, I will contribute my user-interface if you'all want it.  I'm
not married to telix, but I do think it is very good.  We could write comparable
scripts in every major comm program script language.... I'd have to document
my interface.  But if I decide to port my interface to C, I'd like to change a few things, so maybe this is a bit premature.....
I don't understand this last comment.  Maybe it's obvious and I'm just tired...
Part of my script system is after my signature.  Note that I hacked in a C
preprocesser, and this is the output from it, just before the script is compiled
Yes, Telix scripts are compiled! ;^)

@_subject: My Poll.... 
Well, I finally got to look at the responses to my poll.  FYI, I got 33 replies.
This is a small number considering there are (I think) 400+ people on this list.
I didn't take the time to actually tally the results for each question.  I'm
inherently lazy... ;^)  I can make some comments about what we use, tho.  Note that the lists are in no particular order.  Since this was certainly not a scientific poll, I opted to not include any statistics, sorry.  I was kinda
hoping to have a more homogeneous environment than what we have.  Kinda naive,
huh?  Well, this is what I have to say after reading each of your replies.  I
would like to thank everyone who participated in my informal poll.  I hope the
results are usefull to any software-developer-cypherpunks out there.
The systems that we use tended to be (IMHO) hi-end PC's, 386's and better.  Macs
were a close second, with various *nix's forming a large block.  This isn't any
suprise.  The actuall list: PC, NCube, Sun, Mac, IBM RT, IBM RS/6000, DEC/MIPS,
VAX, NeXT, HP 7xx, Cray, SGI Indigo, Amiga.
As for OS's, MSDOS was, again, the clear winner.  It would seem that many people
are going from dos, to one of the various (free) unix's for the PC.  I didn't
know it was so widespread.  The list: MSDOS, BSDI BSD/386, SunOS, A/UX, 4.3BSD,
UNICOS, Ultrix, Linux, MacOS,  HP/UX, NeXTStep, Solaris, AIX, System, IRIX, AmigaDos, vm, DESQview.
There are more Cypherpunks who refuse to use online services than use them.  Of
those who do use online systems, and I counted bbs's and internet as an online
system, these are the systems we use: The WELL, MCI, Prodigy, Compuserve, GEnie,
AOL, BBSs, netcom, Internet, Fido.
I didn't know there were so many mail readers.....
SLMR, MH, pine, elm, emacs, Cyberdesk, Mush, NeXTMail, NUpop, GRn, QWK, Eudora,
dxmail, LOCALLY DEVELOPED I was shocked to find that people still use pgp v2.1.  Why?  Also, unix pgp made a strong showing, considering it probably isn't very secure in that environment.  The only versions mentioned are: 2.2, 2.1, MacPGP 2.1, unix.  I
know of other versions, tho.
This poll was motivated by all of the talk about writing a secure comm program.
Judging from how many different programs in use now, it will be hard to write
a program which will please everybody.  I also wonder if any of the telix users
find telix to be very much like procomm; I did.  Of the telix users, would you
be interested in helping me test my mail scripts, and perhapse writing extensions for other mail readers, if needed?  Hope to hear from you.  Anyway,
here is the list of the comm programs which we use: MacSamson,  JComm, Term,
QuickLink II, PPP/SLIP, Seyon, UUPC, Telix, Z-Term, procomm, Kermit, vlt,
White Knight, Eudora, QModemPro, Procomm Plus, Telemate, tapcis.

Hay all!  I'm becomming very intrigued about digital cash.  But, I have a few
qestions.  1. How does one start a digital cash economy?  How is the initial distribution
of currency done?  This is, of course, assuming the technical stuff is taken
care of.
2. Is digital cash supposed to be backed by actuall cash on deposit at the bank?
3. How would one "get out" of such an economy if he wanted to?
4. If DC is to be backed by actual cash, is this really such a good idea?
Looking forward to hearing any and all comments.

According to Duncan Frissell:
Then DC is actually backed by "legal" currency?  Then, what's to keep someone from opening a digital bank, and takeing the money and runing?
Obviously, DC can lead to quite a few opportunities for corruption, taxes for example.  This will hinder (or help, in Washington D.C! ;^]) the spread of DC.
Is there any arguements for DC, to offer to counter this major drawback?

@_subject: Weak stenography. 
Recent discussion reguarding court-requested plaintext has made if obvious that
data conceilment techniques need to be developed before real privacy can be For the sake of discussion, lets define "weak stenography" as any data-hiding techinique which will fool all but the "informed and skilled" intruder.  For
example, hiding encrypted data in "hidden" files in msdog would qualify as
(very) weak stenography.  By "informed," I mean that the intruder has reason
to think that you are hiding something.  "Skilled" simply means that the intruder has the needed skills to find and verify anything you might be hiding.
Now, lets say some LEA thought you had plotted to (your favorite crime here.)
And that they also suspected that you had encrypted all of the needed evidence.
Further, that you had hidden the data, but couldn't prove it.  In order for them
to get you to produce that plaintext, they would have to be able to prove that
you actually had such data.  The only way that I can think of for them to prove
such a thing is to produce a piece of cyphertext, and prove that it is, indeed,
cyphertext.  Further, they would have to prove that it belongs to you.  So, if
the data is hidden, they have to find it before they can compel you to decrypt it.  Now for a proposal:
Lets say we have to binary files, one that is an executable, and the other some
type of (pgp?) encrypted file.  We take these two files and put the cyphertext
on the end of the executable, and encode the length of the the cyphertext at the end of the resulting file.  Now, lets say that we had xor'ed the cyphertext
with some string before we did the concatenation.
The file-size-change would be a sure tip-off, if the LEA had another copy of the executable to compare with, so assume they don't.  Looking at the file with a binary editor would reveal nothing.  Since the cyphertext was transformed, running the decrypter program on the file would be fruitless.  Disassembling
the executable might, to the real skilled, reveal something, so we can assume
this is what happens.  After this much work, the LEA has some kind of binary
file which they now have to tie to you and prove that it contains some kind of
message.  BTW, you can always claim to have downloaded it from somewhere....
Now they need to figure out how you transformed your cyphertext, if they even
think of that.  Lets say they figure out how you did it.  Now they have to find
what string you used in the xor process.  Give that such a string might be about
6 ascii characters, they have to look at 64^6 different strings; each time through, they have to run the decryption program to see if it recognizes the
cyphertext.  If they can do one such examination per second, this process will take 2.2 years!  And when their done, they still have to prove you put the
message there in the first place.  Bummer.  ;^)
Is there something wrong with my reasoning?  Does this sound plausable.  Would
it be as effective as I envision?  Comments are welcome.  If the response is
favorable, I will try to get it coded in (portable?) C and release it.

According to nobody at soda.berkeley.edu:
The technique I advocated was so simple, I could code it on my lunch hour at work.  I did.  If you didn't want to have such a thing on your machine, you could store it remotely, either on an ftp site or a local bbs.  Clean up your hard disk and there is no sign of anything.
If steganography is to work, we must find ways to make this "principle" invalid.
Strong encryption will protect our "plain-sight-text."  It falls to Data-hiding
to protect our cyphertext.
I was going to suggest, but Phil beet me to it, that we compress our executables
Well, we could do a lot of things here.  We could have the option of xor'ing,
adding, or subtracting....  We could add random bytes to the cyphertext, at offsets we specify and memorize....  I still think this could be done, and that
it would work.  If anyone else shares my enthusiasm, I'll try to get it coded up

obviously won't work.  Well, I guess we could use "he/she."  But that won't work
either since it gives precedence to (gasp!) "HE."  Clearly, we need to come up
with a new word in order to satisfy everybody.  (I use the word "everybody" to

@_subject: fwee! are we having fun yet? 
I'm curious as to what good this will be then.
The distributed nature of a usenet group would be nice....
Without controversial postings, no one will read the group.  What is the point,
Some time ago, I joined the bandwagon in opposing this "hasty" decision to
form the WB group.  But, I like this idea.  My reason for opposing it the first
time was that people's lives/jobs could be at stake.  This might be a germination point for the full-blown WB group, but without the risks to it's
contributers.  I like this idea.
I'm reading it.  And (for once?) I agree on this subject.
I know the feeling..... ;^)

@_subject: Dolphin Encrypt. 
Hi all.  I just received my demo version of Dolphin Encrypt which was shamelessly advertised on this list. ;^)  I haven't had much time to play with
it yet, but I thought I'd post my initial reactions.  BTW, I don't think I've
ever received anything in such a timely manner.  Good job guys.
The disk came with several pages of documentation, and advertising.  The docs
indicate that "the encryption process relies partly on the RSA Data Security,
Inc., MD5 Message Digest Algorithm."  I wonder what they mean by "partly."
Interestingly, a decrypt-only version is available.  Apparently, a C/C++ library of functions is available for $128 with commercial licensing offered.
The documentation indicates that the encryption key can be from 10 to 60 characters in length, with case NOT SIGNIFICANT.
I ran the demo but didn't have time, at the moment, to really get into it, yet.
The demo indicated that the package supports a script language, which seemed to
be very powerfull.  In fact, part of the demo was writen with the scripting
language.  I think this is a novel idea.  The demo seemed fairly intuitive and
presented all (maybe too much?) of the needed information and status indicators.
This is the extent of my comments after a VERY superficial examination of the
software.  I will take a better look at it later this week.  If there is any
interest, I will write a more in depth review.
...just my $.02 worth.

After I posted my menu batch file for pgp, I realized that I hadn't put my name
on it, which I felt I should do.  So, here it is, with with my copyleft message
attatched.  I hope someone enjoys it.
rem This is the PGP menu system by Mike Diehl version 0.0.  This program rem requires 4dos command.com replacement to run.  It may run under norton's
rem N-dos. Since I wrote this program for my own use, and in an effort to help
rem with the cypherpunk cause, I am releasing this program into the public
rem domain.  I ask that this message not be removed, and that you do not rem distribute modified copies of this program.  Further, I hope that, if you rem think this program makes pgp easier to use, you will send me an (encrypted)
rem email message telling me so.  It helps my ego to think someone likes my
rem program besides me. ;^)  I have enclosed my pgp 2.2 public key at the end
rem of this file.  Take care, and enjoy.  Mike Diehl.

Hi all!  Just a quick update on my procmail mail processor rc file.  I have most
of the functionality implemented.  I'm working on speeding up mail delivery and
making sure I don't have a file locking problem.  So far, my system will:
1    Accept incoming mail and determine if it contains a pgp message, key,
     or signature.
2    If it contains a message, it determines who can read it.
3    If it contains a key, it is added to your pubring.pgp
4    If it contains a signed message, the signature is validated.
5    An informative subset of pgp's output is tacked onto the head of the
     message, surrounded by user-defined lines to prevent spoofing of the
     validation info.
6    Finally, the subject of the mail is prefixed with either (key),
     (sig), (prv) to indicate that the message contains a key, signed
     message, or encrypted (private) message.
I also have the capability to use procmail as a pgp-info server.  You could send
me mail with the subject: send pgp-help and my machine would send you a file
which contains help for pgp.  This could lead to lots of uses....
Any comments are welcome.  I should be releasing my procmailrc file within the
week.  Take care, all

According to Mike Ingle:
I wouldn't want to charge for these services since that would introduce a conflict of interest, profit.  I want to be trusted based on my stated policy.
The suggestion of purchasing a ViaCrypt copy of pgp is valid.  As for automation, it would not be all that "automatic."  It would simply comprise tools to issue "Certificates" so that people can show other people to
indicate that my signature on their key is trustworthy.
Comments are welcome.

These are very good points.  After I get this whole thing put together, I may
have an introductory special.... ;^)
And you would be force to trust him, also...and anyone else I may farm this out
to.  Not this kid. ;^)
I was thinking of issuing a signed certificate to the customer indicating exactly why I signed his key.  This could be presented to other people who question my signature.  As per my policy, which can be gotten via finger, I will
sign a key iff any of the following is true:
1. I watched him generate his key.
2. I know the person by sight, and can verify his key.
3. He proves, with picture id, in person, that the public key is his.
4. He sends me a photocopy of his picture id and a signed statement        containing the pgp footprint of his key.
5. His key is signed by someone whom I trust to sign keys.
Note that  implies that the other signer has the same policy.  My policy will
be stated in my certificate.  Comments?

@_subject: procmail-pgp 
Well, I had a few set-backs, but the alpha version of my procmail pgp
preprocessor is ready to test.  I've been using it for about a week now, and it seems to work well.  I hope you enjoy it.  Comments are welcome.
     The procmail recipes in this file will make using many of
pgp's Email-related features automatic.  What they will do for you
1)   Automatically verify pgp signed messages.
2)   Automatically determine who a pgp encrypted message is
     intended for.
3)   Automatically add mailed pgp keys to your pubring.pgp file.
4)   Allow people who do not use pgp to request that their messages
     to you get stored in an encrypted form.  This will prevent
     nosy systems administrators from reading your mail.
5)   Allow people to also request that the entire message,
     including the header, be encrypted.  This will prevent anyone
     from even determining where you get your mail from, mail logs
     not withstanding.
6)   Modify a message's subject to inform you that it contains a
     key (key), a signed message (sig), and/or an encrypted message
     (prv).
     There are a few things I'd like to add to this file.  I'd like
to search messages for references to "pgp", "finger" and have
procmail finger the sender's account and send the output to pgp -
     These recipes are writen in a modular form.  The recipes which
make up this system can be extracted from the rest of your
.procmailrc file with the command:
awk '/ {print $0} {continue}' > out.pro
     To get the system working, you have to have procmail
installed, and in your path.  You will need to edit the included
.procmailrc file as described below.  Then you have to put a (the?)
.procmailrc file in your home directory.  Next, you have to modify
your .forward file to look like:  (change it as appropriate)
mdiehl at triton.unm.edu
"|IFS=' ';if test .`/bin/hostname` = .triton.unm.edu; then exec /nfs/dorado/u11/mdiehl/bin/procmail -p ; else exit 0; fi"
     Finally, you will have to configure the .procmailrc file.  You
will have to change these variables to something appropriate to your PATH= HOME=	
MAILDIR =	/usr/spool/mail	
SENDMAIL=	/usr/lib/sendmail
TMP=		/usr/tmp
The previous ones are self-explanitory.
SECSTR=		=-=-=-=-=-=-PGP-INFO-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Set this one to something pleasing to the eye, but that only you know.  This will prevent others from spoofing the procmail-pgp validation info.  Trust me.
LOGFILE =	$HOME/PROCMAIL_LOG
The logfile is invaluable for debugging.....
AFROM=		"root at can.see.this (Big Brother isn't watching me!)"
ASUB=		"How's the wife?"
When a person requests that all of his message is to be encoded, procmail-pgp
uses AFROM as the new From: header, and ASUB as the new Subject: header.  Be
BTW, if you want to request that either all of a message, or just the body is
to be encrypted, you include either:
X-request-pgp-encoded: all
X-request-pgp-encoded: body
at the beginning of a line in the body of the message, or in the header.  I hope you have lots of fun with this. ;^)

Goodbye, best wishes.  I'm guessing, but I think you're making a mistake in leaving, both for yourself and about us.
We are not being irresponsible.  We have a
different, serious, view of how the world should be made into a good place.  We can only "set the tone," as you say, if what we are saying is founded in truth and competence.  The personal part of this letter continues after the philosophy.

@_subject: pgp request? 
Hi all.
I'm playing with procmail and trying to get it to automate many of the pgp-
related email operations.  I have it set up now, so that it validates all pgp-
signed email that I receive.  It will also automatically add any pgp keys which
are in an incoming message.  My problem, though, seems to that of philosophy.
I also have the capability to check each message to see if pgp was used at all.
If it was not, I could send the sender a one-time-only "advertisement" for pgp.
Also, I could send a one-time-only "thank you" to people who send me email that
is signed/encrypted.
I'm really having difficulty deciding if this is something I want to do.  Please
send me your comments.  Thanx in advance.

Hi again!
     I've gotten some real good replies to my question regarding whether I
should use procmail to send pgp advertisements.  The overwhelming response has
been that I shouldn't.  I will instead, as was suggested, put my advertisement
in my heading, like my pgp key info.  Any suggestions as to what to put there?
     I have also been asked if I intend to post my procmail rc file.  Yes, I do. As soon as I have tested it and feel finished, I will post it to the list.  I've
only been using procmail for ~4 days.
     By the end of the week-end, I will have procmail preprocessing my incoming
encrypted email, a non-secure key on the mainframe to sign quick letters with,
and a secure message-signing and transport system on my pc at home.  I intend
to run the link program from within Telix and Use Mike Ingle's encrypted disk
driver.  Short of burying my computer under 500 feet of concrete, what else can
I do to build a reasonably secure system at home?  Just for the Hell of it. ;^)

Well, I've had a lot of people asking me where to get procmail from.  I'm including several addreses at the end of this list.  At the momeent, I am testing my procmail recipes for pgp.  I suspect I have a file locking problem,
which, while it hasn't manifested itself yet, could cause problems later.  I am
working on fixing this before I release my recipes.  So that I may test my recipes, I would appreciate it if you would send me, first, a copy of your
public key, then a message signed with it.  Also, I would like you to try to
spoof it.  To make this easier for you, I will send you back your message as it

find out for myself.  Well, they do.  Now I understand that these sysops are
spending their own money and equipment to provide these services and have
the right to regulate it in any way they see fit.  That's not the point. The point(s) is/are:
1)   They ACTIVELY enforce this policy.  They don't simply say "no," they
check (presumably) all of their user's email to enforce this policy.
2)   They seem to be afraid to pass/store encrypted messages on their
system.  This indicates to me a lack of understanding of the concept of
privacy.  They seem to buy into the idea that "only BAD people encrypt
     We need to educate the electronic community before we can hope to
educate the general public.  The text of the messages follow with the names
removed.  BTW, the text of the plaintext message was "this is a test."  Just
thought you'd be interested.  Comments?

According to Mike Godwin:
That was my first question.  Then it occured to me that I have seen bbs's which
have disclaimers wrt email privacy.  That is the loophole he is exploiting.

According to Timothy C. May:
I believe I stated this in my original post.  I have no problems with their
right to do this.  I simply wanted to make the point that we need to educate
these people.
I like it!

Well, I have to say that I love this idea!  I have a few suggestions, tho.  How
about we take a copy of the public domain bios source, or disassemble one ourselves.  We hack the code a bit...  Then we burn a new prom to install into
our machines.  AND WE EPOXY THE MOTHER TO THE DAMNED BOARD!  We build a card to
stick in our machine which receives a radio signal which contains a decription
key to be supplied to the bios hacks mentioned above.  So we use a protable
radio transmitter to send the password to our machine.  Our bios waits for this
password for use in decripting the filesystem.  If the bios doesn't get this
password, it trashes the cmos and does whatever other mean things it wants to.
Perhapse part of the card could have login in it which would short the power-
supply to the memory bus... shit!  Hypothetically, we have two passwords for
our system, one for the Feds, and one for Honest people.  When the bios receives
the Fed-password, it acts normally, (for a time?) except it also unleashes a *nasty* virus from within it's own rom!  This would take "care" of the Fed's data in adition to screwing up the machine.
Just my two cents....
