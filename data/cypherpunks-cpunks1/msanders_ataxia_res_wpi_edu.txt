In the beginning there was nothing. Then John Young said:
Yeah, I'm getting really fucking sick of it. This is about the dozenth
copy of this silly thing I've received from various sources. As far as
I'm concerned, the only 'virus' we have to worry about is the
unrelenting propogation of that damn message.
Has anyone actually seen this 'Good Times' thing? I highly doubt
it. And seriously, an e-mail virus? Get real.

In the beginning there was nothing. Then ADAM GERSTEIN, _THE_ MACGURU said:
No, you don't, and yes, it does. But I hardly see the similarity. As
you say, Morris' worm brought the net to its knees in a matter of
hours, yet no _reliable_ source has even mentioned this supposed "Good
Times" virus, let alone *seen* it.
The message itself reeks of the typical chain letter-- oh please send
this to absolutely everyone you know with email! It'll help them lots!
Yeah, whatever.

Once upon a time, Ferguson might have said:
PGP 2.6.2 compiled quite painlessly for OSF, so until someone wants to
move it, you can find it at:
Included is the pgp binary, and all the doc/config files (I hope). Let
me know if I left something out.
Enjoy! *8-)

@_subject: premail 0.30 
I've got premail v0.30 installed here as /usr/lib/sendmail. I added
the $config{"sendmail"}="real_sendmail" option, but this means that
~/.premailrc is not used. But that users can't specify their own
options... Specifically, it looks as if doing it this way I can't
automatically PGP sign my mail without adding it to the global script,
but that would mean _all_ mail out of this site would be signed with
my id. Any suggestions how to go about this? It makes it so convenient
to have it replace sendmail, but I'd like to sign my mail as well.

I did some testing, and sure enough, it reads the aliases in my
~/.premailrc just fine. BUT, it does not automatically sign my
messages as I thought it should. I've double-checked and both
$config{"signuser"} and $config{"signpass"} are set correctly. Oh
well, I'll just have to try out your scripts for elm. :)
