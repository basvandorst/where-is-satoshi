telephone with you, but since time is not on my side,
I decided to put it on a email transmission directly
to you and hope itï¿½s still be kept confidential. I am

Nigeria telecommunications limited (NITEL)
headquarters, I got your contact from Mr. Rasheed
Muhammed who is working with the central bank of
Nigeria and also a member of Polo Club. On one of our
friendly chat, I told him about the need to have an
American friend who would assist me in purchasing
properties and hence he directed me to you.
MY PURPOSE OF CONTACTING YOU:
We have in your neighborhood the sum of US$250,000.00
(Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand United State Dollars
Only) meant to be paid itno (NITEL) account with Chase

10583 U.S.A. nut I want to divert this fund to my
personal account, I am soliciting your assistance to
receive this little fund in your account on my behalf
since civil servants in Nigeria are prohibited from
operating foreign account while still in office.
This offer involves no risk of any kind and I have
agreed to give you 30% for your assistance. Therefore,
if this transaction is of interest to you, contact me
on my private telephone number stated above or you can
