No offense, but what's the point?  What's next, automated key-signing
services?  Is this just intended to help people who can't sign easily
to get around Eric's proposed requirement?  If so, it seems like almost
an embarrassment--someone setting up a meaningless message signer to
spoof the cypherpunk server, which it does easily.  Doesn't sound too
good to me.

You're infringing on hundreds of people's liberty by mailbombing
dozens of inappropriate mailing lists with this junk (I got _two_
copies, and I'm only subbed to one of those lists).  I might
almost be intrigued if there were a shred of a concrete proposal
of some kind in here, but of course there isn't: it's just the
usual vague Libertarian pipe dreams.  But any time I see a
manifesto this long-winded, jargon-filled, and devoid of tangible
ideas, that's exactly what I expect.
My favorite quote:
Whew, _that's_ a relief!  When I achieve complete liberty I certainly
don't want it to make me quit me job or disrupt my life in any way!

Do me a favor, Uni: I want to assassinate you and all the other members

Oh, and while you're at it, give me all of your addresses and precise
travel schedules for the next two weeks.  As an "amoralist," I'm sure you
won't put short term morality before my long-term goal.  Thanks.
I'll judge what I want to, OK?  What are you trying to do, _coerce_ me
into giving information to someone that I don't want to?
Hmm, sounds like you're telling us what to do.  And defining what "we" are,
to boot.  I'm many things besides "crypto non-challenged."  I'm an individual
and an individualist, not a cog with a particular static role in society,
which is apparently the way you'd like it.  If you ask me what the color of
the sky is, I can say "39" if I want.
Yeah, well it seems you were just as quick as the "bleeding heart liberals"
to scold others and impose your personal (a-)morality.  Typical.
No one was suppressing anything or in any way attempting to stop the flow
of information.  They were just expressing their opinions.  Just because
_you_ were unhappy with those opinions, that's no reason to hurl accusations
of censorship around.
I can refuse to give help to anyone I don't feel like helping, and if I feel
like giving him a piece of my mind in the process, that's my business and his.

"Incredibly easy" is an exaggeration, since the docs themselves
say that you need root privileges to install premail properly.
The alternative is using premail in stand-alone mode, i.e., entering
your mail line-by-line a la the generic mail program!  Now, I think
premail is beautiful, but the bottom line is that at this point it's
not something I can actually use, like most email-encrypting tools I

@_subject: We are ALL guests (except Eric) 
So what's the point?  Fortunately, Eric and not you is running the list,
and he's a reasonable man.  Yeah, sure, according to the rules of PPL or
Roman Law or mathematics or whatever, he has every right to take unilateral
action and do whatever he wants to with the list.  OK, he's the "owner,"
so?  This is the real world, not an algebra lesson: the whole reason
this discussion is happening is that Eric realizes there are a few hundred
friends (damn, I should have said "comrades") involved here and he would
like to discuss the issue.  This "ownership" thread seems like a gratuitous
exercise in abstract propertarian philosophy.  Man, some people actually
seem EAGER to have Eric make some drastic unilateral move just so they can
bleat "Yes sir, he's the owner, that's his right!  Yes sir, he's the owner,
that's his right!" and have their worldview sanctioned.
Yes, that IS his right, but he's obviously too nice a guy to just do it
tomorrow morning without discussing it first and then inform us all of the
new status of his "property."  So why don't we just discuss his proposal?
I agree with Tim that effortless encryption/signing of email is still a
dream for most of us.  I don't think there should be any "punishment" for
not signing (not even having the non-signer's mail delayed).  I do think
signing should be encouraged.  I think that at some time in the future
(a year?) Eric's proposal may be reasonable, but I don't think it's time

You want to take a look at the ECPA (stands for Electronic
Communications Privacy Act--I think).  I don't have URLs handy, but it
should be easy enough to find via Alta Vista or Yahoo.
The way I understand it, though there are fairly strict limits on the
snooping your employer can do, you waive more or less all your privacy
rights if you sign a form saying you "consent" to the snooping.  Your
encryption question falls in kind of a grey area (most of the ECPA
deals with reading people's email, etc.), but it's probably covered in
there somewhere.
I have very strong feelings about this subject, but I'll keep them to
myself for now since I'm posting from work.  We were all informed a
week or two ago that Bear Stearns is now archiving every piece of
email coming into or leaving the company.
All I'll say here is that I disagree strongly with the views Tim May
posted about employees' property rights, etc. (though we agree on most
other things).

Funny thing is, _I_ just wrote a long piece on anon remailers too, though
it was obviously from a different perspective from Peter Lewis's (and a lot
better written, natch).  The local paper it was written for liked it, but
thought the subject matter was "too technical" for its readership, so I'm
hoping to get it published elsewhere.  When I got the idea, all I could
think of was why no one else had done a piece specifically on remailers.
It's an important story.  I guess everyone else was working on them at the
same time.
I hope that there are some good pro-anonymity pieces published soon to give
some "balance."

I have a good friend who writes for the Times.  Last time I spoke to
him, he was frantically trying to get in touch with the Business editor
because a piece he'd just written had been hacked to bits, with several
inaccuracies introduced.  He probably couldn't reach the guy, and I bet
the mutilated version got printed (I don't know for sure, since I don't
read the Times).  This is standard.
It's almost a rule that whenever there's a story on a subject you're

For the record: It's Leuchter, Fred Leuchter.
Ken McVay.  And dozens of other people too.  The newsgroup is
alt.revisionism.  If you've got any interest in the "holocaust
revisionism" phenomenon, it's well worth at least a brief look in
Incidentally, I would say that this is one of the best uses of the
net I've ever seen.  This particular brand of neo-nazism is tricky:
in their case, it really is true that there's no such thing as bad
press.  Any exposure they get on TV, the radio, or in print media
helps their cause, because of the inherent limitations of those
media.  They can throw up smokescreens, spew out blatantly false
"facts" that sound plausible but can't be confirmed or denied then
and there, put on the "we're just skeptics who feel that these
questions need to answered even though they're controversial" act,
etc.  Very difficult to counter, given the strict limitations on
time and resources of live broadcasts.
But on the net, where claims can be researched and repudiated and
responses "broadcast" almost immediately, and where people have all
the time in the world to debate these issues, these guys get
absolutely trounced every day.  They make a claim, it gets blown to
smithereens instantly by a dozen people with access to university
libraries and scanned photos, and the revisionists crawl away for a
while.  Then they come back a month later and start again.  It gets
kind of old after a while, but's fascinating to see (especially for
those naive young people to whom the revisionists seem "reasonable").
Even for a part-time Luddite like me, this is an excellent
demonstration of how the net is in many ways fundamentally different
from traditional print and broadcast media.
Well, I hope my little digression above is at least slightly relevant.

But it's not quite that simple, Sameer.  Don't underestimate the more
subtle forms of non-cooperation you can engage in.
To use the most obvious example, different remailer operators turn
different levels of logging on.  So one operator will say "Yes, I am
obligated to fully comply with your subpoena, officer.  Here are the
full logs for the last six months."  And another will say "Yes, I am
obligated to fully comply with your subpoena, officer.  However, I
keep no logs at all of the mail sent through my remailer.  Drag, huh?"
Being the eternal pessimist, I once again point out that the
government will try to stop cryptoanarchy any way they can.  Their
main tool is the law, and they WILL use it eventually when all else
fails.  Personally, I would play it safe by operating on the
assumption that basically EVERYTHING will be illegal eventually and
"finessing" laws will become more important.  In short, they WILL have
a subpoena--then what?
Of course, I personally would never do anything illegal.
