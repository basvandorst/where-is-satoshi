Hi All
Thought Ant Brooks would say something about this but since he did not,
here is a quick summary with comments.
Please do not distribute outside this list as I have supplied basically
the same thing to a paying customer for inclusion in their
Hopefully I didn't screw up factually.
SA passes Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill
On 7 June 2002, the SA Parliament passed the ECT bill [1], against
fierce opposition, especially from within the Internet industry.
While the bill does have some positive aspects, some of its other
far-ranging provisions have aroused ire amongst industry old-timers
and professionals.
The bill provides legislation in the following areas:
* Planning and implementation of a national e-strategy, including
provision of internet access to disadvantaged communitites.
* Electronic transactions and signatures, which are given legal
* E-Government services.
* Cryptography providers. This section makes it illegal to supply
cryptographic products without registering, and paying a fee.
* Authentication service providers, and standards for being an
accredited Authentication Service Provider.  See "Cryptography".
* Electronic transactions and e-commerce, including protections
for consumers.
* Spam seems to be given "opt-out" status, not "opt-in", although
other provisions try to limit the use of "personal information".
* So-called "Critical Databases".
* The Domain Name Authority and administration, where between 8

this is not explicitly mentioned. The cell-phone industry provides
a clue.
* Limitations on the liability of Internet Service Providers. The
Service Provider is seen as a "mere conduit" as long as, amongst
other provisions, he does not "modify the data contained in the
transmission". The effect of this provision on ISPs who automatically
remove viruses from client email is not specified. ISPs do not
have a general obligation to monitor traffic on or through their
* The appointment of "Cyber Inspectors", who can enter ISP secure
server rooms with a warrant and poke their noses wherever they like.
* Cyber Crime, which outlaws amongst others, hacking, cracking and
malicious code.
The provisions which have attracted the most flak revolve around
the new .za domain name authority. It is currently run by Mike
Lawrie, who has been doing it since the commercial internet arrived
in South Africa. He has ICANN approval. He is so upset by the
provisions of the new bill that he has threatened to "pull the
plug". [2]
So far this has not happened.

deals with the .za namespace. They dropped the number of people from "8
