I've just submitted the first draft of an Internet-Draft to the IETF.
If it makes it through the whole editing process, it will take an
existing file format used for identity-description, and adds a few
details to allow crypto algorithms to be used for
identity-/assertion/. It may not seem like much, but it could improve
some aspects of hierarchical certificate authorities, encrypted email,
and suchlike. It’s the most important thing I think I’ve been able to
work on in the last little while, and I hope the editing process goes

A new version of I-D, draft-boese-vcarddav-signedvcard-00.txt
has been successfully submitted by Daniel Eliot Boese and posted to the
IETF repository.
Filename:        draft-boese-vcarddav-signedvcard
Revision:        00
Title:           vCard Format Extensions : Signed vCards
Creation date:   2013-08-30
Group:           Individual Submission
Number of pages: 11
Htmlized:        The base vCard 4.0 specification defines a large number of properties.
This specification adds two new parameters and six new properties to
vCard 4.0, which allow the use of cryptography and public-key
infrastructure (PKI) for identity assertion.
  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
  be sent to vcarddav
Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission
until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

Thank you for your time,
"Then again, I could be wrong."
