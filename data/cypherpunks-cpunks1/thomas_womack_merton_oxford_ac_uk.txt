@_subject: Prof Shamir arrested 
A few column inches in the British Independent had Prof Avi Shamir (who I guess is the S in RSA) arrested in Israel, on (I believe) suspicion of involvement in a substantial fraud.
We will do what we have always done when we've had our back to
the wall; we will turn round and fight.

But the question is one of how fast the key-search can be made, not of when
the key would be found - and I though the d.n website displayed a figure for
keys-per-second. That it takes the network not very long to find the DES key
0x0809182395f8ee isn't a very interesting piece of data; the keys-per-second
figure is more useful.

I suspect you will still run into things which are illegal anywhere;
national-security stuff can be handled provided you've got a complete list
of pairs of unfriendly nations, but I don't think (eg) the more extreme sort
of kiddyporn is legal *anywhere*.
