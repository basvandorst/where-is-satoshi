@_subject: Eudora/Trumpet encryption 
I'm a crypto newbie here, but does anybody know how Trumpet Winsock and/or Eudora encrypt the passwords in their .ini files?  I am trying to write a front end for a client and would rather it set up automatically rather than the program ask.
How would I go about cryptoanalysing this?  If it were a simple XOR, then wouldn't Plaintext1^Cypher1 == Plaintext2^Cypher2 and so on?
Thanx for any help you can give me on this matter,

I guess most everybody has seen the response that Netscape put on their page, but did people check out the "for more info" link It says that the commerce server supports (among others) DES and DES3 (same as 3DES?).  They list the key sizes as 64 and 192 bits respectively.  My question is, isn't DES 56 bits?  (with an 8 bit salt that would be 64 I guess), but isn't DES3 112 bits, not 192?
Just wondering...

I use mkpgp.  It is a script that requres a lot of setting up, but once you learn what you are doing it makes sense.  Depending on how you want it, it can be totally transparent.  Personally, I took it off of total transparency, and now use it by invoking it with Atl-&

@_subject: Don't trust the net too much 
In the Canadian CFS (Canada Flight Supplement), a manual distributed to all Canadian pilots and continuously updated, there is a section on this kind of thing.   The basic gist of it is that there is no proof that computers and cells cause interference, tests have proved inconclusive, but there is suspicion.  Then, of course, is a silly little form that you are supposed to fill out if you ever have such a problem.
As for cells, a collegue (with his Commercial rating, was going for an
Airline Transport Rating) swore up and down that cells do nothing, and
that the only reason there are phones on airplanes is because with a
standard cell you can phone just about anywhere locally because of the
range an air-ground connection would have a 30,000'.  The plane phones are
supposed to have some sort of device that uses the local cell and forces you to pay LD charges.  Whether it is true or not....
But anyway, aircraft instruments operate in just about all bandwiths (HF, VHF, UHF mainly, with VHF being very popular.)
