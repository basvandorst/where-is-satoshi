@_subject: How can you protect a remailer's keys? 
A far better solution would be to have a long-running daemon hold the
secret key.  The mixmaster client could talk to the key daemon through
a unix-domain socket with the permission bits set such that only the
mixmaster user can connect.  Each time the machine is rebooted, the
operator must start the daemon and give it a passphrase.
This has two advantages.  First, it's a lot harder to back up the key
by accident.  If the key ever starts making it only your daily
backups, you are completely hosed because erasing a bunch of mag tapes
would take a lot of time--and maybe you also want to keep your
Second, if your machine is seized or someone gains unauthorized
physical access to it, the easiest way to get a root shell is by
rebooting single-user.  However, if the only cleartext copy of a key
is in memory rather than in the filesystem, once the machine is
rebooted the secret key is lost.

I hope this is not true.  Some of us simply believe it is important to
help people with unpopular opinions speak without fear of harassment.
I for one will continue to operate a free remailer even if the
technology becomes available to charge for the service.  I hope others
will, too.
Some people do care about things other than money.  I hope the reason
there aren't more remailers out there is simply that it is sort of a
pain to set one up, rather than simply because nobody cares.
Well, wanting there to be remailers is a good incentive to run one.
Another good incentive is if you ever want to send a truly sensitive
anonymous message.  If you chain through your own remailer, then you
can be absolutely sure that at least one remailer in your chain is not
run by "bad guys."
Usage statistics are publicly available from mixmaster remailers by
sending mail with subject "remailer-stats".  Whenever I've checked,
the number of messages through the lcs mixmaster remailer has been
around 300/day.  This is neither a longtime remailer nor a
particularly accurate statistic, but it should give you some idea.

The answer is no.  Plenty of sites gate mailing lists to local
newsgroups, and allow open or relatively open NNTP access.  It's also
silly to assume every other person in the universe is trustworthy.
If Mr. Y sends lots of obnoxious mail to a mailing list or news group,
the proper thing to do is to put Mr. Y in your killfile and encourage
others to do so.  That way you don't get bothered by his annoying
messages, and if enough people follow suit, people stop responding to
Mr. Y's messages.  This can be even be extended to cover anonymous
posts using NoCeM-like systems.
If you try to boot Mr. Y off the mailing list using technical means,
several bad things will happen:  First of all you will fail, which
will give Mr. Y a great deal of satisfaction.  Second of all, you will
drive Mr. Y to start posting under different names, making him
considerably harder to killfile.  Third of all, you will double the
traffic on the mailing list by starting flamewars about whether this
failed booting attempt was ethical, legal, intelligent, homosexual,
scatological, or just plain useless.  Since at this point tons of
people will be replying to threads, a killfile becomes even harder to
So don't look for convoluted technical solutions to Mr. Y's
personality problems.  Just use a little basic common sense.  If you
don't like the way someone behaves on a mailing list, just ignore the

searches for censorship (initially ignoring sex),

"+sex" is actually a valid search to find pages which contain the word
sex, but again such a search is not very likely to be useful.
This isn't any kind of censorship attempt on the part of DEC, just a

Functionality is so distributed physically, in fact, that there are
even particular lesions which can disrupt reading of phonetic kana

Since vocabulary appears to be content-separated physically into

only affects some groups of words, and not others. For example,

Nothing like this, coupled with repeated false claims of "forgery", to give your posts a little "plausible deniability", is there?
Your obsessive disinformation campaign continues, I see...
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well, if posting public information is OK, then why the hate campaign against Ron Guilmette and his business for (allegedly) doing like you and Gary did?
Actually, either you're lying now about the reason that Gary posted the info
back in February, or Gary was lying back then when he said: "What say each time you slam DataBasix for no reason, we post some publicly available information about monkeys.com.  HEre's the first try" and "More where this came from. Yu wanna keep slamming DataBasix for no good reason?". [1]  That sounds like an attempt at censorship through intimidation to me.  After you pull stunts like that is it any wonder that people post their opinions anonymously?  The more you attack anonymous remailers and their users, the
more people will see the benefit of utilizing them.
           ^^^^^
No, LIFE isn't, but, OTOH ...
Now I'm beginning to see why you weren't able to convince Jeff Burchell that
you were a "lawyer" for DataBasix when you tried the Scientology-esque stunt
of demanding that he turn all of his (non-existent) user logs over to
DataBasix to use in their witch hunt against the users of his remailer. [2] Going on a tantrum like that in a courtroom would get you jailed for contempt of court.
I see you haven't changed your typical DataBasix tactics of demanding proof
from others, but never bothering to offer any for your own accusations.  Like
the accusations that Ron Guilmette "spam baited" addresses at databasix.com.
(The only thing you've posted that even looked like evidence was some idle
talk about netcom.com addresses.)  Or how about that claim that Mr. Guilmette
supposedly "abused" an unnamed "teenage girl" at DataBasix?
As far as giving anonymous posters a bad name, since when have you EVER
had anything decent or civil to say about those who don't believe that setting one's self up for abuse should be the price of free speech?  Calling
anonymous posters "anon assholes" only betrays your pernicious bigotry and
hatred of those who dare to speak their minds without subjecting themselves
to the revenge that seems to (coincidentally?) befall those who dare to
criticize the almighty Sadaam Burnore.
As far as "delta sub-morons" engaging in "forgery" (assuming they aren't your
fellow "delta sub-morons" on the DataBasix gang) what about all the crude
attempts at forgery involving the e-mail addresses of those who've dared to
publicly disagree with Gary Burnore and his DataBasix wrecking crew?  What
about the letters in various MMF and MLM NGs saying "I have a lot of money
to invest, please send me information on how I can get rich quick" and
purportedly signed by these folks?  I must have missed your vehement
protests about that.
Did anyone force you to post THIS tantrum?  Don't let the door strike your posterior on the way out.
Once again, you post accusations without proof.  (Maybe I ought to do my
DataBasix impression of you and Sadaam Burnore stomping your feet and chanting in unison, "Not a shred of evidence! Not a shred of evidence!")
You can only say "I didn't do it, nobody saw me doing it, and you can't
prove a thing" so often.
Your post no evidence that such alleged abuse even occurred, nor that, *IF* it
did occur, it was perpetrated by someone other than you or one of your fellow abusers at DataBasix, perhaps as a pretext to get a remailer shut down.  If by your "former e-mail address" you're referring to an account at DataBasix.com,
could the real reason be that Gary is so technically inept that he has been
unable to get the databasix.com domain up and running after his hasty exodus
from California to North Carolina?  that's been his alibi -- "I
couldn't have posted any spam bait - databasix.com is still down".
Your whining is so hypocritical, anyway.  Where were those protests when your
fellow staffer at DataBasix, William J. McClatchie (aka "Wotan"), was busy
making THOUSANDS of e-mail addresses useless when he went on his successful
campaign to get the Mailmasher server shut down?  (Remember the bogus "forgery" charges and the pitiful "evidence" that was posted?)
Why?  You claim to have "plonked" him/her....

That's a wise idea for the same reason that retail merchants remove the cash from their cash registers when they're closed, leaving the cash drawers unlocked.  There's less temptation to stage an attack if you know in advance that you won't get what you're seeking (the identity of someone you'd like to silence, for example) by staging such an attack.

I don't agree with you on this one, Bob.
The fact is that the 16th was never properly ratified.  It slid through the cracks, contrary to the procedure for ratifying amendments as outlined in the Constitution.  The reason there was no public outcry was because the initial tax was 1% on anyone earning more than $4,000 a year (roughly $80,000 in today's money).  Besides, I seriously doubt many people rushed
down to the Treasury to cough up their 1% either.
This deceptive non-ratification is clearly documented by Bill Benson in his book "The Law That Never Was" .  Although his book has been in print for several years, I have yet to hear of anyone who has refuted his claims.
The "pseudoconstitutionalist claptrap" that should be pointed out is your claim that "the constitution's what the Supreme Court says it is."  Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court judicial power "...to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this The words "under this Constitution" imply that the Supreme Court must work by the letter of the law as outlined in the Constitution.  How can the Supreme Court pass a decision involving the 16th when the amendment was never ratified as outlined in Section V?  These are the kind of shenanigans
one would expect from a banana republic tribunal, not the Supreme Court.
Why bother to repeal what never existed?  When enough people learn what really happened, and when they couple it with the fact that most of their tax money is wasted and could be better "redistributed" according to their
own individual judgement, the house of cards will collapse.
I hope so, too.  But I don't advocate waiting until that day to fight back.

@_subject: PGP 5.0: What were they thinking? (revisited) 
I went and took a look at this. They've broken the PGP functionality into
several different psuedo-binaries which are just symlinks which point to the
same binary. Invoking just 'pgp' gives this:
Now this, of course, breaks all matter of things. Some of this may be wrong, so feel free to correct it:
Phil releases PGP. It rapidly becomes a standard for personal privacy and is
used all over the world. Various versions come about including several
international versions. Finally PGP 5.0 is released. It uses a completely new scheme, including DH
keys. The Windows version purposefully excludes RSA key generation, in
effect forcing people to generate DH keys. There is no UNIX version released.
Weeks or months later, after incompatabilities were introduced into the
system, UNIX versions begin to filter out. Instead of keeping command line
compatability so scripts and programs which call PGP still work, they decide
to break the functions up into several different invocations, all of which
point to the same binary anyway. The README-BIN file for the "beta 11" Linux
distribution says:
They also take the liberty of coding in a timebomb:
$ ./pgp
This beta evaluation version of PGP has expired.
$ pwd
"lnx-b11" is the version currently handed out by  by the
way. The "PGP 5.0 beta for Linux Intel (US version)" selection on their
download page leads to a link to:
The current source distribution from that site is b8a. One of the README files from that reads:
However when one goes to  they're confronted with a legal
agreement. Of course the link to it from the front page won't work in Lynx 2.7.1 because it uses something called an "https" link, so the user has to type in the URL manually as " After reading this license and agreeing to it, the user is allowed to reach
the "BetaWeb" page. However the "public bug reports" link yields this:
So maybe you can at least get whatever the current beta is and hope it
works, right? Wrong. "PGP Personal v5.5.1 BetaHome"'s "Beta Software &
ReadMe Download Button" wants a user name and password, but it's doubtful
they have a UNIX distribution in there anyway considering the rest of this
mess. Well, at least maybe the user can suggest a new "feature" for PGP 6
and that feature be "Release a source distribution which when installed
doesn't break anything which calls PGP," right? Wrong. You have to have a
username and password for that too.
Well, obviously they want you to register as a "Registered PGP Beta Tester"
to get this clearance. However "Beta Registration" yields:
And of course my 2.6.3i breaks on this "Hash: SHA1" stuff.
So correct me if I'm wrong but the way I see it is like this: A new version
of PGP was released. It was incompatable with previous versions. They
release a Windows version but don't release a version which works under
UNIX. Of course Windows users now start using the "latest and greatest,"
sending messages and keys all over the place which are completely
incompatable with the version of PGP everybody else is using. They claim to
be working on a UNIX version, granted, but that should have been released
at the same time as the Windows version and *AFTER* there was an
international version of PGP 5.0 available. Their UNIX version of PGP 5.0
also seems to be completely incompatable with anything which calls PGP from
a script or program. In addition their UNIX versions are purposefully
crippled so that they don't work after a certain time period, don't provide
an override for this that I can see, and they insist on releasing
binary-only distributions for Linux which prevents people from commenting
that out. They have no method to get new up to date versions, nor do they
have a method to report bugs like they say they do. Further the
"PGP50-lnx-b11-6126098-1.src.rpm" contains the *BINARY* distribution, *not*
the source. I've also been informed that PGP 5.0 encrypts to the CMR key
without even bothering to ask and there's no way to override that short of
hacking the key record.
What the hell are these people thinking? Did they get into bed with
Microsoft to try to get people to say "screw this" and go use Windows?

If you use PGP 5.0 many people will refuse to read your messages and send them to you. They won't be able to decrypt your messages, verify
your signatures, or use your keys. In general, using 5.0 just pisses people
off. 5.0 is purposefully incompatable with all previous versions of PGP,
they purposefully haven't released usable versions except for Windows and
possibly Mac, they've purposefully broke any scripts and programs which
invoke PGP, they purposefully made command-line versions of PGP many times
more annoying to use, and PGP 5.x encrypts to a "CMR key" without having the decency to ask. Generally the PGP 5.x folks are being complete and total assholes about this entire thing and haven't done anything to improve the state of cryptography
today and a whole lot to worsen it. Somebody recently posted a large rant about this titled "PGP 5.0: What were

How to Spot a Government Infiltrator                               by Mike Johnson
Those who have been studying the stories released to the media these days about the arrests of
various different people within the militia movement will doubtlessly have noted that government
infiltrators are usually involved. This should make people nervous. And rightly so. Our normal view of government is that the only people who should have to worry
about what the government is up to are people who are breaking the law. As the vast majority of
constitutional militia units are composed of people who are of good character and don't go around
breaking the law to begin with, they might feel that they should have little to worry about from the
government. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. The government appears to be going all out to
discredit the constitutional militia movement in this country. This effort on the part of the government
does include the use of government agents to infiltrate militia units and cause as many problems, hate
and discontent as they possibly can. In many instances, these government agents may not be readily
apparent as to who and what they are. Some of these people may have had extensive experience in
working undercover operations and may not make some of the more stupid mistakes. There are a variety of different roles that such government operatives may play. The first is that they
may simply act as a mole. They will do everything anybody else in the unit does, and do nothing at all
to call undue attention to themselves. However, they will relay everything that goes on within the unit
to their handlers. About the only indication a unit may have that they have been infiltrated by a mole
may be that they can't seem to be able to keep anything a secret. This type of role is the most difficult
for a unit to detect and deal with. Which is also possibly why most of the spy novels that get written
deal with various different ways to smoke out moles. While I wouldn't suggest that anybody try a
technique for which the only source of documentation is a work of fiction, it is an indication of just
how obnoxious this type of agent could be to deal with. Another role that a government agent might play may be that of a dissipator. A dissipator is one who
tries to redirect the course and energy of a unit in ways which will cause it to accomplish nothing of
any importance. They may also act so as to break a unit up by emphasizing differences,
disagreements and personality clashes between unit members. Given that the people who are
attracted to the constitutionalist militia movement usually tend to be strong willed and opinionated
people to begin with, such an agent may find that his task is somewhat easier than it might be if he
were working with other groups. Unit members should simply be encouraged not to take things
personally, be aware that there will be honest differences of opinion between the members of the unit,
and to be wary of somebody who does try to take everything personally, or set up cliques within the
unit. The final role which will be discussed is that of the agent provocateur. Such an agent infiltrates a unit
and tries to get the members of the unit to actually commit crimes, or make it look like they are
actually planning to commit crimes. One should also bear in mind that a government agent is not going
to be confined to operating within any one of the roles that have been discussed, and may likely mix
and match as they feel best. However, the role that has received the highest profile in government
operations these days is that of the agent provocateur. That is largely because the results of an
operation conducted by an agent provocateur or two make for good propaganda when the media
gets hold of it. The resultant publicity given to the arrests and the charges gets used to brand
everybody in the entire movement as a criminal. The fact that the entire thing was set up by someone
in the employ of the government isn't going to be mentioned at all by the mainstream media. For those who haven't caught on by now, your antenna should start to quiver in the presence of any
one, or especially a combination of the following behaviors/patterns demonstrated by a unit member:      (1) Wants to make bombs.
     (2) Wants to get everybody else to make bombs.
     (3) Wants people to buy/store large quantities of substances which could be used for
     explosives manufacture.
     (4) Fanatic about obtaining fully automatic weapons, without benefit of Class III
     license.
     (5) No obvious means of support, especially if they have lots of money to throw
     around.
     (6) Auto license tag changed on an irregular basis.
     (7) Encourages people to plan/do stupid things (raid armories, blow up office buildings,
     etc.)
     (8) Some groups can get auto tags run. They should be especially suspicious of
     anybody whose auto tag turns up a complete blank when run. (9) In our case, the guy
     was absolutely paranoid about his car being out of either his sight or his "wife's" sight for
     even a trivial amount of time.
     (10) Person claims to have a military background that they do not have. One individual
     claimed to be former Special Forces, but was found to be ignorant of some of the things
     that he should have known when quizzed by people who were former Special Forces.
     Depending on the level of trust that the members of your group have with each other, it
     might be a good idea to request to see the DD-214s of anybody claiming to have a
     military background.
     (11) One of your members has taken effective action to expose or block activities of
     the police or government preventing the expansion of or preservation of government
     power to control people and/or invade the privacy of the people.
     (12) One of your members (a) has an FFL; or (b) is involved in selling at gun shows; or
     (c) Is involved in promoting gun shows. Arguably the best way to deal with people who meet criteria 1-10 is simply to invite them to leave
the unit. As Starr and McCranie found out, trying to turn them in will do no good at all, so the next
best bet is to try to get them to leave. Failing that, disband unit, start again from scratch with people
you can trust after sufficient elapsed time. Given the way things are going right now, those who have
not joined up with public units may want to consider forming small closed units with just a small group
of people that they have known for a long time and that they trust. For persons in 11, and 12: Do your best to be sure the goons cannot find a pretext as that is what
they often work from. (*) Bill Albert of the Michigan Militia contributed to the list of items to look for and the discussion

The Military's Growing Involvement In Domestic Law
                              Enforcement
For more than a century the U.S. military has been banned from involvement in routine domestic law
enforcement. This tradition of separating the role of national defense from domestic law enforcement
has it's origins in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. This law prohibits the army from being involved
in domestic arrests, or in searches and seizures. This ban was later extended to the other services. It
was passed in response to abuses committed by occupation troops in the South after the Civil War.
This long tradition, which has helped to insure liberty and democracy for Americans, was quietly
abandoned in 1989 when Congress and the Bush administration ordered the military into the "war on
drugs". Since then the Pentagon has spent more than $7 billion on counter-drug activities, using tens
of thousands of active duty and reserve personnel.
Active duty units are primarily used to monitor and patrol for drug smuggling activity using
sophisticated surveillance and communication systems. These units are assisted by thousands of
National Guard troops whose activities are not normally restrained by the Posse Comitatus
legislation. This allows them to perform routine police activities such as inspecting cargo, analyzing
intelligence, and translating wiretapped conversations.
The military's involvement in domestic policing activities has now been institutionalized and is being
coordinated in the Defense Department by the Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6).
Supporter of using the military in drug enforcement activities argue that drug use threatens the country
economically and socially. Some military commanders see counter-drug operations as providing
troops with useful training. While law enforcement officials see it as an opportunity to benefit from
sophisticated surveillance and communication systems that they wouldn't normally have access to.
Opponents of giving the military domestic law enforcement responsibilities and powers remind
supporter of the abuses by troops that originally lead to passage of the Posse Comitatus legislation.
They also point out that the military's involvement in drug enforcement efforts haven't had any
discernible impact on the availability of drugs in the United States; so why take the risk of losing our
liberties when we gain nothing in return.
People need to ask themselves where the movement to involve the military in domestic policing
activities is going to stop. Are Somalia, Hati, and Bosnia simply peacekeeping activities, or are they
being used to train U.S. troops for the near future when they will be patrolling the streets of the
United States as they now patrol Bosnia.  -0777-- -export-a-crypto-system-sig -RC4-3-lines-PERL

some rather wierd incidents I've observed since then.
People say that the only reason to pay in cash is if you have something to
hide. You're damned right. The last thing I want is a bunch of government shills keeping track of what I buy so that they can stage some raid because they have a record of me paying for a beaker "which could be used" to mix chemicals which "could be used" as explosives, or metal "which could be used" to make thermite which "could be used" for some nefarious purpose.
In America today if you have interests in biology, chemistry, or physics it
is considered grounds by both the government and the pathetic sheep to shoot
you. Pardon me if I'm a little bit paranoid these days. It used to be
intellectuals were just beat up and made fun of by the others in schools.
Now it's fashionable to throw them in jail or kill them. "Unauthorized and illegitimate research:" what a stupid concept.
The American people consider anybody who does things in secret to be
automatically guilty. Forget the principles that America was founded on! When the government sends the ninjas into your home because you were going 56 mph
when you passed a cop on the highway and looked over at him the wrong way
they sieze your computer. They find that you're running Linux. Oooh, you
must be evil because your computer is password protected but the Microshaft
apologist across the hall has his computer wide open. They find that you
have blocks of random data on your drive, and even if they don't get them
decrypted because they *ARE* blocks of completely random data they wave it
in front of a jury and get a guilty verdict.
It's a sad, sad state of affairs.
It is when I read things like this that I realize how completely stupid the
entire government position is. Why do you need to buy ammonium nitrate to
make a bomb?
Assuming you just don't use something else which is more effective, why not
do this?
 NH OH + HNO --> NH NO  + H O
   3        3      3  3    2
So this naturally leads to the following question: Is having nitric acid and
ammonium hydroxide now a crime worthy of ninjas flying through your windows
with big guns in the middle of the night and shooting you because "you
looked like you were going for a weapon" when you flushed the toilet and
pulled your pants up?
Then if they don't have anything to charge you with they plant some drugs in
your toilet tank and claim that you were in "possession of drugs with
intention to distribute." Of course you were going to distribute them! You
had a truck and you frequently drove around! Exactly. Welcome to the shakedown extortion police state known as Amerika,
Land of the Freeh.

It seems so pointless to correct Choate.  The guy is almost totally
impervious to enlightenment.  But a couple of whoppers have to be
pointed out...
Electrons don't "carry" photons.  An atom can absorb a photon, raising
an electron to a higher energy level, but the photon is then gone.  And
a single moving electron certainly doesn't carry a photon.  Photons move
at the speed of light, always.
Quarks are constituents only of baryons.  There are no quarks in electrons
or photons.
Choate's bizarre description of a "spark gap" inside a conductive
globe culminates with this:
The net charge within the sphere will not change.  If the box in the
middle with the "spark gap" is spraying out electrons, this can only mean
that the box is itself becoming positively charged.  The sphere sees a
constant charge within itself; at best, the charge can be redistributed.
There are no net changes of charge within the sphere and so there will
be no changes in any charge appearing on the outside of the sphere.
Choate's whole model of how a spark gap transmitter works, and why it
emits electromagnetic radiation, is so bizarre that it is hard to believe.
Someone else can bang their head against the brick wall of his ignorance
on that topic.
Choate is, by far, the worst poster on the cypherpunks list today.  He

@_subject: Grounding (fwd) 
Listen to this.  Jim Dolt thinks that a spark gap inside a conductive sphere
will cause charge to build up on the surface of the sphere!  The dunderhead
has forgotten about conservation of charge!
Gauss' law says that the charge on the outer surface of a closed
conductive sphere will be equal to the net charge inside the sphere.
The spark gap can't change the net charge inside the sphere, it can just
move charge around.  Jim Dolt has conveniently forgotten about the net
positive charge which will build up on the spark gap as it (supposedly)
emits electrons.
His Doltish notion that electrons will hit the inside of the sphere
and "tunnel through" to the outside is totally confused.  Suppose this
happened.  We've removed negative charges from the interior of the sphere
and put them on the outside, where they would give the sphere a negative
charge.  Now, what is the net charge on the interior of the sphere?
We started neutral and removed negatives, hence it's positive!  Gauss'
law would imply that the sphere must have a positive charge.  But Jim
Dolt tried to give it a negative charge from all those electrons that
"tunneled through."
The whole idea is ludicrous.  No charge can spontaneously appear on
the outside of an ideal closed conductive sphere.  This would be a
violation of the law of conservation of charge.  By Gauss' law, the
charge on the outside is equal to the net charge on the inside.  If a
sphere, just sitting there in empty space, suddenly develops a charge,
then that means that the interior has manufactured charge out of nothing.
It is impossible.
The fundamental misconception that started this whole sad comedy of
Doltish errors was Jim Dolt's belief that a Faraday cage has to be
grounded in order to suppress electromagnetic radiation.  This has led us
to his revelation of his further misunderstandings of how charge behaves
inside a conductive surface, not to mention his numerous errors about
the mechanism by which a spark gap transmitter generates EM radiation.
(Hint: it has nothing to do with a cloud of electrons spreading out from
the spark gap!)
The fact is, Jim Choate knows nothing about this topic, and the same is
true for most subjects that he writes about.  He loves the attention
he gets, but if more people told him they knew how worthless his
contributions are, he just might go bother someone else.

No doubt it would be rude to point out that it was Tim May's aggressive
defense of off-topic postings that has made cypherpunks a safe haven
for the likes of Jim Choate.
As for Choate, perhaps his least charming trait is his insistence on
posting his incoming private email to the mailing list, as though
cypherpunks were his personal mailbox.  He even scolds people who have
the courtesy to take off-topic discussions to private email.
This behavior is exactly the opposite of appropriate mailing list

His particular stench has been fouling the list for far too long.

@_subject: Securing data in memory (was "Locking physical memory (fwd) 
There used to be a rule of thumb that you'd want roughly a megabyte
per megahertz.  Today, with our 200+ MHz processors, we tend to have
considerably less memory than this.  My Gateway PC from a couple of
years ago came with a 200 MHz Pentium Pro but only 32 MB of memory.
Most PCs today are not well balanced architecturally.  They should
really have a couple hundred megabytes of memory.  Memory is cheap
enough today that this can be added, but the motherboard configuration
may limit the amount.  If you had this much memory, swapping to disk
would be a smaller problem.
As for the idea of running without a disk drive, see the handheld PDAs
like the PalmPilot and the Microsoft WinCE machines.  The problem with
these from the security standpoint is that the memory is non-volatile.
With a PC, we don't worry too much about junk in memory because we turn
it off occasionally.  We are concerned about the disk because that is
where the persistent storage is.
But with a memory-only machine, you end up using your memory as a de-facto
disk drive, so that the contents of memory become just as sensitive as
the contents of disk would be on a PC.  Someone who gets hold of your
PDA can dump out memory and find sensitive data which is stored there.
Theoretically you can use a password to protect data, but then there are
tradeoffs between security and ease of use, and you may end up leaving
data exposed for extended periods.
But speaking of using passwords to protect data, how about an encrypted
swapfile for a PC?  There are fast enough ciphers today that the virtual
memory system could encrypt data as it swaps to the disk, and decrypt
as it loads back into memory.  You'd type in the passphrase at boot time.
This would solve the problem of sensitive data leaking onto the disk via
the swapfile.  There could still be traces in memory, but at least this
most obvious leak would be plugged.  You don't have to wait for apps to
be rewritten to use secure memory allocation drivers, you get the benefit
Can existing encrypting-filesystem drivers be used for swapfiles?

Using a monospace font, let your eyes separate so the text blocks merge
and you will see the word HI displayed.
To make this all you need is a random character generator to make the
left block, and copy it to the right block.  Then take the "pixels"
where you want letters to appear and shift them one character to the
left in the right-hand block.  Use the random character generator to
fill in the blanks which this shift causes.  That's it.
The hardest part would be finding a simple block font you can use for
the letters.
Now, here's the bonus.  This is a perfect cover for sending large amounts
of random data.  Put your favorite political or sports message in the
stereogram (GO BUSH) and use the random data for steganography.
In the example above the left block is a base 64 encoding of a simple
message.  Unix users can pass the stereogram through "sed 's/ .*//'
without any headers so it looked purely random.  There would be no way
to distinguish it from any other source of randomly generated characters.
This could even catch on as a legal "thumb your nose at the spooks"
fad, people adding random sterograms at the end of their messages.
You could even have an active .sig which had a constant message but used
different random characters each time.  There typically wouldn't be any
hidden messages, but there would be no way to be sure.

This great anonymous posting from **1992** shows just how farsighted
the cypherpunks list was in its early days.  Enjoy...
                            Extortion Explosion
Governments are in the extortion-and-protection racket, as are some well-known
smaller ventures. Why do these major organizations spend effort on protecting,
instead of just extorting? Current protection rackets maintain a monopoly and
manage "their" resources for sustained yield. Without protection, their
revenues would decline through a tragedy of the commons mechanism. Other
rackets would threaten the same victims, piling extortion on extortion, until
the economic field is bare.
Crypto technologies promise to liberate us from government extortion and the
"protection" of victimless crime laws by enabling the growth of a new sphere
of economic activity based on voluntary, secret transactions. But are these
technologies so limited in their power? New opportunities in the extortion industry:
Old problem: the victim may inform the police, making it risky to pick up the
money, which will likely be watched.
     New solution: demand payment via cryptomoney.
Old problem: if you build a reputation for carrying out your threats,
parasitic competitors can issue threats in your name, collecting while your
reputation is good but destroying your reputation by not following through on
     New solution: authenticate your threats and demands with digital
Old problem: you may be caught firebombing the house, shooting the victim,
slashing the victim's daughter's face, or whatever; if you subcontract to a
thug, the thug may be caught and inform on you.
     New solution: use cryptomoney (and a reputation for paying) to hire thugs
while maintaining anonymity.
Old problem: providing protection, so that you keep a supply of economically
viable victims from whom to extort.
     New solution: Please find one! If the government can't protect victims
from you, how can you protect them from competitors?
     If this analysis is correct, then crypto technologies will make extortion
a highly profitable growth industry, making the security of property and
persons (outside tightly-knit walled communities?) incompatible with the
continued existence of free computer networks as we know them. Rather than
suffering from a single oppressor with an incentive to keep us productive, we
would become prey to an unbounded number, each competing to strip our assets
before they vanish. Society will surely suppress free networks once this
starts to happen; the harder it is to suppress free networks, the greater the
oppression will be.
Some objections and answers:
Q:Isn't it too bleak and pessimistic to believe that the best we can do is to
help our oppressors to maintain their monopoly on oppressing us?
A1: The Soviet Union was established as a result of a movement that aimed to
overthrow an oppressive order. Millions then died under an even more
oppressive order. This was bleak, but it happened anyway.
A2: Better one oppressor than many, all competing to be the first to kill and
eat the goose, knowing that they can't get the golden eggs anyway.
A3: Profit is a powerful motive, and conventional profitable activities are
imitated and expanded until demand saturates. Crypto-extortion should be
highly profitable, but the "supply" is delivered by force, so there is no
problem with competitors saturating the "demand" until the victims are drained
quite dry. This gives grounds for pessimism.
Q: Doesn't the enormous potential of this technology for expanding liberty
outweigh these theoretical dangers? What about our hopes and dreams, our
vision of a better world?
A: These hopes spring from a theoretical social and economic analysis of the
impact of crypto technologies, and cryptomoney in particular. The above line
of reasoning extends the same analysis. I hope it is wrong, and would be
greatly relieved to hear a convincing reason for dismissing it. If it stands,
the prospect seems to be either the destruction of society by free networks,
or the destruction of free networks by society. The longer we can postpone
this choice, the better.
Q: Won't cryptomoney be so hard to establish that there's no point in worrying
about this?
A: If so, then there is equally well no benefit in attempting to implement it.
The question is, are there any conditions for "success" that don't generate
disaster? Saying the gun probably isn't loaded isn't an argument for putting
it to your head and pulling the trigger.
Q: Isn't it too late to stop these technologies?
A: For public key communication (secrecy and authentication), probably yes.
For cryptomoney, possibly no. Most of the benefits of crypto technology seem
to come from the former, and most of the danger of an extortion explosion
seems to come from the latter.
Wishful thinking in the pursuit of liberty is no virtue; realism in the
defense of imperfect liberty is no vice. Free-lance oppression isn't freedom,
and I don't want it.
P.S. Your neighbor didn't pay me, and his house is ash. Will you pay me? All I
ask this month is $100, which you can well afford. (Next month is negotiable,
and I can't speak for my competitors.)

@_subject: CDR: Re: "ChronoCryption" algorithm - $50 reward for spotting a flaw 
Your idea is to take BBS as a stream cipher, use a value based on a
secret short key as a starting point, and then cycle it potentially a
whole lot, millions or billions of cycles or more, before beginning to
cipher the message with it.
Using the idea of Rivest et all you can cycle BBS forward arbitrarily
far in a limited amount of work, if you know the modulus factors.  So
you can encrypt with little work, while making the decryptor do an
arbitrary amount of work even if he knows the key.
You've combined the idea of time lock crypto with an encryption function.
It's not clear these two ideas go all that well together, like the SNL
product that was both a floor wax and a dessert topping.  Usually you
either want to encrypt, in which case you want to make it easy to decrypt
for the guy who knows the key, or you want to time-lock, in which case
you want to control how hard it will be to find the key.  There don't
seem to be that many cases where you want to allow decryption but only
if you both know the key and are willing to put in a lot of time.
Even if you did want to do that, you could just use Rivest's time lock
to hide a key which then gets combined with your short key to produce
the actual key to the message.
Along these lines your own idea could be simplified; don't encipher the
whole message using BBS, just encipher a block-cipher key and use 3DES
or similar to encipher the message.
You might also want to take a look at the paper by Dan Boneh and
Moni Naor from Crypto 2000,
They have a similar idea but came up with an application for it in fair
contract signing (where one party should not end up with the signature on
a contract unless the other party does too).  For their application they
need to be able to encrypt a message such that it can only be decrypted
with a specified large amount of work.  However they must be able to
reveal the encrypted message and prove that the decryption was accurate,
using a small amount of work.  This could be done in your scheme simply
by revealing the modulus factors (the "long key") but they want to reuse
the modulus so they use some fancy zero knowledge proofs.

  Last I checked, the vast bulk of remailers were in North America and

stubborn cypherpunk libertarianism.  "I don't got to justify nuttin' I do,
screw you officer."  Or the whiny, "But Microsoft does it, why can't I???"
BU points out that you DO have to justify what you do, like it or not, and
that Microsoft DID get in trouble for these practices.
The point which has not been made clearly is that despite the legal
arguments against remailers which BU raises above, there are strong
legal arguments in favor of remailers as well.  It is these positive
arguments which we must rely on in a legal context.  Head in the sand
libertarianism won't help.
Remailers exist to provide for the possibility of anonymous communication
in a medium where it is otherwise impossible.  They are an attempt to
extend the status quo for other forms of communication into electronic
mail.  The do not introduce new challenges or threats into society.
Rather, they preserve existing capabilities as we move into a new medium
of communication.
Due to its technical nature, electronic mail is inherently traceable.
Every step in the communication involves recording where the message
came from.  This allows the mail to be traced back to its source.
Remailers exist solely to remove this traceability and to therefore
provide for anonymous communication in the medium of electronic mail.
Anonymous communication exists and has always existed in many other forms.
Postal mail, physical delivery of anonymous notes, posting handbills,
passing out leaflets, all have been traditional methods for propagating
information anonymously.  Every one of the bad consequences of anonymity
listed above exists with these other forms of anonymous communications.
Terrorists, blackmailers, criminals of all stripes use the postal service.
Anonymous publication of unpopular political arguments has occured since
the founding days of this country.  Anonymity is nothing new in the world.
Courts have consistently declared that anonymous speech is a protected
right.  See for example the 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case McIntyre vs Ohio,
 which relies
on Talley v. California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960).  By providing anonymity
in a medium where it would otherwise not be present, remailers join
technologies which "have played an important role in the progress of
mankind" (quoting the Talley decision).
Any legal action against a remailer would attract interest from scholars
and political groups all over the net.  First amendment experts, free
speech experts, civil liberties groups, all will support the remailer
with arguments and briefs.  Chances are that financial support will
be available as well.  BU's "gray haired Reagan appointee" judge is
going to be operating in a fishbowl of media attention and legal advice.
He needs to be very careful to stick to the legalities knowing that any
decision against the remailer will be appealed and backed up by the many
interest groups who will be watching the case.
These are the kinds of issues which any defense of a remailer will need
to rely on in the courtroom.  Cypherpunk attitudes of "I don't need to
keep no stinkin' logs if I don't feel like it," won't go far.  It's a
legal and political issue and that is how the battle must be fought.

Actually the tide is turning on this issue.  There have been two
high-profile cases this year in which suits designed to reveal the
identities of pseudonymous posters have failed.
In May, Medinex dropped its lawsuit attempting to learn the identities
of its online critics.
Wonder why they were concerned?  Take a look at
  The stock
has fallen from almost 10 to about 0.2 in the past 18 months.  Ouch.
A month earlier, the EFF and ACLU were successful in quashing a subpoena
by foundering auctioneer 2TheMart.com attempting to identify pseudonymous
participants in an online bulletin board.
The company is currently defending itself against charges of securities
It seems that the same kind of people who run a company into the ground
are the ones who want to muzzle their critics and who are least tolerant
of anonymity.  These two recent successes by the EFF will hopefully set
precedents for better protection of identity.
Of course, the real problem is the use of utterly inadequate technology
for pseudonymous activities.  People don't realize how risky it is
to participate in an online financial discussion without adequate
technological protection.  When things go wrong, litigants will lash out
at anyone who is a target.  Financial chat without layered protection
is like sex without a condom.
The list posted earlier (thanks, Seth) provides a good starting point
for online protection: The gold standard for this technology is the Freedom software from Zero
Knowledge Systems.  But if you're not willing to pay, at least go through
another site before trusting your identity to an online chat service.

Not true.  Look closely at
 (note that
the final colon is part of the URL).
   No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively
   controls access to a work protected under this title.
This is the basic provision which outlaws circumvention.
   PERMISSIBLE ACTS OF ENCRYPTION RESEARCH- Notwithstanding the provisions
   of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a violation of that subsection for
   a person to circumvent a technological measure as applied to a copy,
   phonorecord, performance, or display of a published work in the course
   of an act of good faith encryption research if--
      [Various provisions, including making a good faith effort to get
       permission]
And this is the provision which allows encryption research even when that
involves circumvention.
Neither of these addresses publication.  This is possibly covered in
the following:
   No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide,
   or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device,
   component, or part thereof, that--
      (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of
      circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls
      access to a work protected under this title;
      (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other
      than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls
      access to a work protected under this title; or
      (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with
      that person with that person's knowledge for use in circumventing
      a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work
      protected under this title.
It is not at all clear that publishing a research result relating to a
cryptographic problem in a copyright protecting technology would fall
into any of these categories.  First, such a publication is clearly not a
"product, service, device, component, or part thereof".  Conceivably it
could be a "technology" although most cryptographic papers are a long
way from an actual technology.
Second, the primary purpose of such a publication is not to enable
circumvention, but to advance the state of the art in science.  Hence it
is not covered by provision (a)(2)(A), and not by (B) or (C) either.
Nevertheless if publication were to be interpreted as being covered by
this provision, there is a further exception in 1201(g):
   USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES- Notwithstanding
   the provisions of subsection (a)(2), it is not a violation of that
   subsection for a person to--
      (A) develop and employ technological means to circumvent a
      technological measure for the sole purpose of that person performing
      the acts of good faith encryption research described in paragraph
      (2); and
      (B) provide the technological means to another person with whom he
      or she is working collaboratively for the purpose of conducting the
      acts of good faith encryption research described in paragraph (2)
      or for the purpose of having that other person verify his or her
      acts of good faith encryption research described in paragraph (2).
Again, this appears to be interpreted in the context of (A)(2) forbidding
the actual construction of devices which are are developed, employed,
and distributed.  Even if we interpret (A)(2) to include cryptographic
publications, however, the provision still applies.  Note in particular
the language in (B) which allows another person to verify the act of
good faith encryption research.  This is one of the main purposes of
publication, to allow verification of the results by others.
Hence publications which show cryptographic holes in deployed encryption
systems are exempt.  This provision also allows the distribution of
circumvention software for legitimate research purposes.
Note too the additional provision:
   Nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish any rights of
   free speech or the press for activities using consumer electronics,
   telecommunications, or computing products.
Clearly publication of cryptographic results is a fundamental part of
free speech and will not be infringed by the DMCA.
Much of the hysteria regarding the DMCA's supposed ability to quash free
speech by cryptographic researchers is being whipped up by opponents
to the DMCA who are misrepresenting the DMCA in a calculated fashion in
order to promote opposition.  Consider two recent cases.
Dmitry Sklyarov of Russia has been arrested for violating the DMCA.
Many DMCA opponents initially claimed that he had been arrested for
discussing problems in Adobe's ebook software.  This claim was false and
has been largely abandoned now, but it has served its pupose of giving
the impression that DMCA will criminalize publication.
Princeton Professor Edward Felten and his research team were prevented
from presenting their results regarding flaws in SDMI Information
Hiding Workshop, based on a letter from the Recording Industry Association
of America which claimed that such publication would violate the DMCA.
In this case, the RIAA was mistaken about the application of the DMCA,
as the above analysis makes clear.  In fact the RIAA takes that same
position now, as seen in
The decision to pull out of the conference was made jointly by Felten,
his team, and conference organizers.  If they made the decision based
on fears of the DMCA, their decision was mistaken.
Again, anti-DMCA forces have used this case as an example of how the DMCA
supposedly prevents free speech.  In fact it is more an example of how
the misinformation spread by DMCA opponents is preventing free speech.
Had the true facts about the DMCA been widely known and disseminated,
Felten et al would have presented their paper and the RIAA's letter
would have been seen at the empty threat it was.  (Yes, lawyers issue
letters with empty threats and bluffs all the time.  It's called the
real world, folks.)
There are many problems with the DMCA, but opponents will serve their
cause best by being honest and straightforward about what the measure
does and does not do.

Marking: A Privacy Protecting Approach Against Blackmailing
Dennis Kuegler and Holger Vogt
Blind signature based anonymous payment systems [Cha83] have been
invented for privacy protecting payments over the internet. However,
it was discovered by von Solms and Naccache [vSN92] that unconditional
anonymity may be misused by criminals: A blackmailer can exploit the
properties of the used blind signature to receive blackmailed money from
his victim so that neither the victim nor the bank are able to recognize
the blackmailed coins later. Furthermore, the blackmailed coins can be
transferred anonymously via an unobservable broadcast channel (e.g. a
newsgroup). This attack is called the perfect crime, as it is impossible
to identify or trace the blackmailer.
To solve anonymity related problems as blackmailing, money laundering,
or illegal purchases, payment systems with revokable anonymity have been
proposed [CMS96, JY96, FTY96, JY97]. In these payment systems trusted
third parties are able to revoke the anonymity of the users at any time.
In our opinion blackmailing is the most serious drawback of the known
payment systems offering unconditional anonymity. Attacks like money
laundering and illegal purchases aren't a major problem in anonymous
electronic payment systems, as these problems are even worse with
physical cash [Fro96], because in anonymous electronic payment systems
the bank always knows how much a customer withdraws and how much a person
deposits. Thus the bank is able to detect either the initiator or the
recipient of a suspicious transaction.
In this paper we will show how to fight blackmailing without
restricting the anonymity of users as it is done in systems with
revokable anonymity. We present a new online payment scheme, which offers
unconditional anonymity, but does not suffer from the blackmailing attack
described above.

@_subject: Declan misses the mark on ecash 
Declan McCullagh reports in Wired Online,
   The more important patent for digital cash, titled "Blind signature
   systems," was granted in July 1988 and expires in July 2005.
   Chaum's method preserved anonymity through a statistical technique. It
   can be thought of this way: A customer of a virtual bank would create
   a $1 coin by sending, say, 100 coins with random serial numbers first
   stuffed into electronic envelopes.
   The bank randomly would open 99 of the 100 envelopes to verify that the
   denominations were in fact $1 and the customer wasn't trying to commit
   fraud. After the bank owner was satisfied that the last remaining
   envelope was likely to be a $1 denomination too, the bank would sign
   the envelope -- marking it as digital cash -- and return it unopened.
Of course this is a completely incorrect description of Chaum's cash
system as it has been fielded in DigiCash and eCashTechnologies.
It is a botched attempt to describe the "cut and choose" mechanism.
But that was only designed for an offline cash system.  The purpose
of cut and choose was to check that the customer had properly encoded
*his identity* in the cash, not that the denomination was correct as is
described here.  The reason the customer encoded his identity was that
if he then double-spent, the bank could determine after the fact which
customer had done it because double-spending would reveal his identity.
But of course DigiCash was always implemented as an online system,
where double-spending is not possible, since coins are always verified
at the time they are spent.  It never used a cut and choose mechanism
for withdrawals, which would have been painfully inefficient.
Instead, the customer simply sent one "enveloped" version of a random
serial number to the bank.  The bank signed the envelope, and the type
of signature determined the denomination of the coin.  The customer then
took the serial number out of the envelope to get his cash.  It's far
simpler than the description above would suggest.
The article also contains a recap of the Chaum/Brands patent wars.
It would have been more interesting if there were some reference
to new approaches to ecash that avoid the patents, such as the
Lucre software by Ben Laurie, based on David Wagner's blinding
( or the recent proposal at
Eurocrypt for a cash/credential system based on zero knowledge proofs
without blinding ( or .pdf).

It's not so bad that you botched cut and choose, it's that you misled

readers who were undoubtedly scratching their heads trying to make sense

Again, you misled the public by implying that all potential approaches to

original blinding patent and in fact is designed to avoid ALL patents.
It appears to be an unpatented method for doing ecash.  (Caveat, of
course anyone trying to judge whether a particular technology is truly
unpatented should consult a lawyer.)
This kind of mistake, implying that all feasible approaches to ecash are
patented, plays right into the hands of those who want to keep these
technologies off the market.  Ironically, this article will therefore
serve to delay the progress which the author claims to desire.

Probably so, see the references in the recent critique of the Wired
Well, the problem is that to exchange cash for tokens, you need a
way of sending cash to the bank.  But if this exchange is to be done
electronically, then that means you are sending e-cash.  But your "tokens"
*are* e-cash!  So your description shows how to get anonymous e-cash,
but only if you already start with anonymous e-cash.
What you can do is to do an initial withdrawal of e-cash,
non-anonymously, then do anonymous exchanges for fresh e-cash
tokens.  This is essentially the approach of Dan Simon of Microsoft,
which is unfortunately patented, US05768385.  It is described at
  Here is some
analysis from June, 1998 cypherpunks post:
: The basic idea is that to withdraw money, you select a random x and
: send f(x) to the bank, where f() is a one way function.  The bank debits
: your account and sends you sign(f(x)), a signature on f(x).  To deposit
: the money you need to supply both x and sign(f(x)).  By requiring you
: to exhibit x, sign(f(x)) is no longer sensitive, so you don't have to
: encrypt your communications with the bank.
: : To pay someone else, you send them x and sign(f(x)).  (This transaction
: does have to be encrypted, because it includes x.)  Now, if he just
: deposits this to his bank account, the transaction would not be anonymous
: since the bank would recognize sign(f(x)) as being associated with a
: specific withdrawal.
: : Instead, the recipient can do the standard anonymous-exchange trick,
: long discussed in the context of Chaumian cash.  He anonymously sends x,
: sign(f(x)) to the bank along with a new "withdrawal request" created by
: randomly choosing y and sending f(y) to the bank.  The bank exchanges
: the coin, sending sign(f(y)) back anonymously.  Now this second party
: can spend his coin y, sign(f(y)) with someone else, who does a similar
: exchange.  (The obscure "claim 27" quoted in the patent excerpt described
: this process in the case where change is being made, and multiple coins
: are received in exchange for one deposited.)
: : Simon's protocol has several problems.  First, the whole business
: about sending around the secret values x and y is largely pointless.
: Since you need secure communications for some steps, you might as well
: assume you have them for all of them.  In that case you could just send x
: to the bank and get it signed (forcing x to be of some restricted form),
: and then let sign(x) represent the coin.  Everything works the same way.
: : Second, it is not really anonymous.  Note that no blinding is used.
: Although the bank does not know who turned coin x into coin y, it does
: know which coin was exchanged for which.  Suppose it goes through, say,
: three steps before being deposited.  Coin x is withdrawn, anonymously
: exchanged for y, which is anonymously exchanged for z, which is
: later deposited.  The bank knows who withdrew x and who deposited z.
: It doesn't know who the intermediate parties were, which is the extent
: of the anonymity.  If the coins are circulating among a tightly knit
: group this could completely compromise anonymity as the bank gathers
: data on payment patterns.
: : Furthermore, it is not clear how long these transfer chains will be
: in practice.  It may be in many cases that a coin is withdrawn and
: then immediately deposited.  That's how cash businesses work these
: days.  For that case, Simon suggested (at Crypto) that the recipient
: could perform some "dummy exchanges", so it would look to the bank
: like it had gone through some third parties.  But if the bank suspects
: this is going on, it is ineffective.  The bank sees a withdrawal by
: Alice and a deposit by Bob, after some intermediate transfers, and
: it may speculate that Alice paid Bob directly.  Again, sufficient
: statistical data can be built up over time to correlate transfers and
: reveal these patterns.
: : This whole effort is an attempt to get anonymous payments without
: violating Chaum's patents.  But the anonymity is extremely weak, and
: the use of one way functions makes the protocol look more sophisticated
: than it is.  Ultimately, this is just a matter of banks issuing signed
: tokens to represent coins, with people being able to exchange them for
: new ones anonymously.  As such, the idea has been discussed since the
: early days of cypherpunks and would not be patentable.  Simon had to dress
: it up with the one way functions to get something that looks different,
: but ultimately it is nothing new or interesting.

Bush May Limit Germ Weapons Info
 By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration is considering whether to restrict distribution of
 government documents that describe how to make germ weapons, White House officials said Sunday.  U.S. stockpiles of offensive germ warfare agents were destroyed nearly three decades ago as part of
 the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. But the government kept the blueprints for manufacturing
 such weapons, and continues to sell them.  ``The administration is generally conscious of this issue,'' John H. Marburger III, director of the White
 House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a telephone interview Sunday. ``There are
 obviously people thinking about what to do about it.''  The administration is likely to take action on the matter, Marburger said, adding that he did not know
 what action would be taken nor when.  Homeland Security director Tom Ridge hinted that the administration is strongly considering placing
 new restrictions on the information.  ``We are a very open society and we're very much an information society, and there are a lot of us that
 think that some of the information we share with the public probably should be restricted in some
 fashion,'' Ridge said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''  Marburger and other administration officials are ``looking to see what kind of information should be so
 easily available in the public domain,'' Ridge said. Members of Congress have also aired concerns
 about the issue, he said.  ``We are open, we are trusting, but we have to be a little bit more careful and a little bit more vigilant,''
 Ridge said. ``And we may have to take a look at these kinds of issues from a different perspective
 because of the tragedy of September 11 and the follow-on incidents that we've had to deal with.''  Several agencies are weighing the level of danger and possible action, Marburger said. A
 spokeswoman for the Defense Department said Sunday she could not comment, as did a White House
 spokesman. Representatives of the Justice Department (news - web sites) and the White House Office
 of Homeland Security did not return calls.  Marburger said he had not personally seen the documents on assembling such weapons. Among the
 questions is how dangerous they are, he said.  ``It is clear that they are based on a picture of biology that's almost 50 years old,'' he said. ``It's not
 clear to me how useful they are.''  The New York Times first reported on the documents and the debate in Sunday editions, and said
 despite their age, the manuals contain information that could help produce the kind of anthrax powder
 infected at least 18 people and killed five in the United States last year.  According to the newspaper, federal agencies routinely sell the now-declassified documents to
 historians and researchers. The government provides more sensitive papers on the subject after
 Freedom of Information Act requests.  Dr. Harry G. Dangerfield, a retired Army colonel, is preparing a report for the military that will call for
 the reclassification of more than 200 reports that he told the newspaper are cookbooks for turning
 germs into weapons.  Any such move to reclassify the manuals would run into resistance from advocates of public access to
 government documents.  Moreover, an executive order signed by then-President Clinton (news - web sites) in 1995 bars
 reclassification, the Times said. The Bush administration is considering its own order allowing the
 documents to once again be kept from public view, it reported. Marburger said Sunday he did not
 know about any such move. I found to have enough info to culture and sporulate, though
you'd have to look elsewhere for freeze drying and milling

@_subject: Patriot II would outlaw encryption 
Sure you will. The "ongoing conspiracy" (an agreement to commit a felony) continues after various events. For example, if Ted and Alice have an ongoing implicit understanding that they will meet in the shed behind her house occasionally to tend the five marijuana plants growing there, that is an ongoing conspiracy to commit a federal felony. So if, a week after Ted's last visit, Alice sends him an encrypted email saying "Come over and watch a video, or whatever", the prosecutor can clearly use that (if he can decrypt it) as 5 more years in prison, since it used encryption technology and concealed an incriminating communication (the crime being conspiracy) that they are commiting (ongoing). The prosecutors can get Ted's passphrase by granting him immunity (probably ONLY immunity from the encryption enhancement penalty, or best case, from that and conspiracy, still nailing him for the pot felony, or getting Alice to roll over on him for the whole deal!!!!) and forcing him to disclose it having eliminated his 5th amendment defenses. Then they have Alice for the pot felony, conspiracy, and the 5 year encryption booster. Of course, they will simply hang all of this draconian punishment over her head, her attorney will say they can fight for $75,000 and 2 years, during which she is in jail, or they can plead it out and become a felon with few further rights of citizenship.
And if you "detail a crime" after the event in an encrypted communication, you've essentially included another person in the knowledge of a past crime in the expectation that such disclosure will remain secret from law enforcement. That is conspiracy to avoid prosecution and probably obstruction of justice. Conspiracy and obstruction are crimes, you've just used encryption in a federal felony, 5 year enhancement. Bye.

@_subject: Singularity ( was Re: Policing Bioterror Research ) 
Like someone already mentioned, all that is needed for the total collapse of the US government is that 90+% of sheeple abstains from TV and newspapers for 30 consecutive days (externally induced psychosis needs constant maintenance.) Such detox event would be the most dramatic social phenomenon in the last hundred years.
But it's impossible promulgate even that simple idea and therefore the frog stays.

@_subject: Forget VOA -- new exec order creating Global Communications 
Actually, it is reality not a goal. A better statement would be "The US dominates the world, and if you act otherwise, we will kill you. If you think otherwise, we will find out and you will become a "person of interest" and placed on the "no-fly" and TIA watch lists. And if you are a US citizen, remember you are a check mark away from being an "enemy combatant" in a military prison of our choosing, with no lawyer, no judge, no appeal to anyone, anywhere, forever."
The US is no longer content to be  It demands respect for being  thru  inclusive.

Nothing forces you to tell anyone else that you booted securely.  At most
someone may offer to give you something in exchange for such a proof,
but you're not obligated to take them up on it.
It's not clear what you're getting at about exporting the host key.
These systems (TCs) are generally designed to make that difficult or
impossible to accomplish.  The security of the whole system is built on
that assumption.  If you actually did manage to pull out the host key
then you could make it attest to any falsehood you wanted, although you
might get caught eventually.
Trusted Computing lets people convincingly tell the truth about what
software they are running.  This is seen as a horrific threat in certain
circles.  It's easy to see why liars wouldn't like it.  What does an
honest man have to lose?

@_subject: Off-the-Record Messaging (IM plugin) 
Nikita Borisov and Ian Goldberg have released
Off-the-Record Messaging (
an IM plugin for private communication providing not only
the usual encryption and authentication, but also deniability and
perfect forward secrecy.  Deniability avoids digital signatures on
messages (while preserving authenticity and integrity), so there is no
hard-to-deny proof you wrote anything in particular; in fact, there is a
toolkit to help people forge messages, making it extra-hard to pin
things on you.  Perfect forward secrecy means that your past messages
and conversations remain protected even if your keys are compromised.
You can read the OTR protocol description, download the
source code for the gaim-otr plugin, or grab a gaim-otr binary package for
Debian or Fedora Core.

@_subject: Trusted Computing in Vista BitLocker 
With its release of Vista, Microsoft is taking a step forward in
exploiting the controversial Trusted Computing technology.  For the
first time outside of a research setting, the "sealed storage" feature
of Trusted Computing will be used in a way that can potentially restrict
user access to data.
Trusted Computing relies on the TPM chip to take a "fingerprint" of
the system configuration as it boots. During the PC boot process,
which consists of several stages, each stage hashes the next one,
storing the results into the TPM. At the end of this process the TPM's
Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) contain hashes of the data that
was involved in booting.
Sealed storage is data encrypted to a TPM key, and locked to the
values in one or more PCRs.  The TPM will only decrypt the data if the
current PCR values match what was specified when the data was encrypted.
This insures that sealed data can only be decrypted if the system is
booted into a specified configuration.  Changes to the boot configuration,
either by altering the BIOS, changing the Master Boot Record, booting to
an external device like a floppy, CDROM or external disk, and similar
alterations, will result in different PCR values and prevent the TPM
from unsealing data.
Vista's new disk encryption software, called BitLocker, optionally uses
this feature of the TPM to strengthen its encryption.  For example,
consider various attack models for disk encryption.  A laptop is stolen
and the attacker now seeks to decrypt the disk and recover the data.
The first step often applied in this situation is to take an image of
the disk and run the attacks on that image, from a computer controlled by
the attacker.  This prevents the laptop OS from performing self-destruct
operations or otherwise keeping the attacker from being able to reset
the disk to a pristine state.  But with BitLocker, the disk decryption
key is sealed to a TPM key (a 2048 bit RSA key).  No amount of brute
force password guessing will work to recover a key from a disk image;
the TPM chip itself has to be involved.
An alternative for an attacker, then, might be to use the laptop itself
but to boot into another OS, such as via a Linux "Live CD" or external
device.  It can then mount the partitions with the encrypted data and
apply similar attacks.  This will give access to the TPM hardware while
still preventing the BitLocker software from having control.
Again, the BitLocker design will thwart this attack, because the
sealed storage locks the encrypted disk key to the boot configuration.
Changing that configuration by booting into another OS will change PCR
values and prevent the TPM from unlocking the key, even if the correct
password is used.
The attacker is then forced to build a robot that can type on the
keyboard, or a special electronic circuit that can tap into the cable
connecting the keyboard to the computer and can mimic key presses.
Even then, TPM chips have features to limit the feasibility of password
guessing, and will shut down or slow down when too many wrong guesses
are entered.
Overall, the BitLocker design appears to be a good application for TPM
based sealed storage, exploiting this technology to greatly improve
resistance to typical attacks against disk encryption.  However there is
a side effect of this design which may have implications for Microsoft's
competitive strategy in the future.
Because BitLocker locks the disk key to the boot sequence, any dual-boot
system that uses this capability will not be able to decrypt the encrypted
data when the alternate OS is booted.  Users who want to share their
PC data between Vista and Linux will not be able to use this advanced
BitLocker capability.
For years, compatibility between Windows and Linux has been limited,
ever since Microsoft migrated to the undocumented NTFS file system.
Gradually this situation has improved as Linux developers have reverse
engineered NTFS, and now many Linux distributions ship with at least
read-only support for NTFS file systems.  This is a benefit for Linux
and improves its usability and compatibility.
BitLocker changes this game once again and throws up an enormous
roadblock against allowing Linux and Vista operating systems to coexist
and cooperate on the same computer.  Looking forward, we could imagine
a time when BitLocker encryption via the TPM is the default for new
systems shipped with Vista installed.  This would provide the kind of
"security by default" often demanded by independent experts and would
indeed arguably be a boon for typical users.  The problem would be that
any such user who wanted to experiment with Linux would find that his
Vista data was off limits unless he decrypts his disk.
BitLocker, especially if it becomes more widely fielded and used, could
play a significant part in slowing the deployment of Linux and similar
alternative operating systems.  It is a small step towards the widely
discussed Trusted Computing tradeoff of users accepting limitations on
how their data can be accessed, in exchange for improved security and
protection of that data.  Given the magnitude and importance of these
issues, it will be especially interesting to see how this element of
Vista technology is received as the new OS is rolled out.
