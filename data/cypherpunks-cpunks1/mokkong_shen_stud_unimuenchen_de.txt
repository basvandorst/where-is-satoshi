Hence the best way, once there are strict export regulations, is not to export. One moves rather knowledge (thought) across the country boundaries and there build locally the desired software. That's why I believe it will be increasingly more essential for the future to have good crypto algorithms that are very simple to describe and
implement. Whether these are very fast is at most of secondary
importance. For really very critical applications seldom involve
huge volumes and even if they do the computing cost hardly matters
and one can employ multiple hardware to achieve the required
rate of transmission.

I don't see why you have to pose such severe selection criteria.
As long as a number of countries don't yet have export regulations,
one can have a number of archive sites in each one of these
countries, in so far as the financial problem is solved. We aren't
choosing a single central archive that should be up for eternity.
If the 'economies', 'infrastructure' 'religon' and what not of the countries do not (yet) affect crypto laws, why care about them? If at a later point of time some of these countries do have crypto laws, well, simply close down the archive there and let the sites in the remaining countries take over the downloading demands of the
closed down sites. Isn't that simple?
Much more important is to discuss how to solve the finacial problem
of setting up such archives, to have people maintaining them,
the technical problem of storage and the general policy of storage,
I believe.

Let there be a large number of sites. If part of these fail, there
are others that are successful. (Compare evolution.)
How, for example, can they affects the functioning of an archive, if you get the right people and machine?
It is not true that there are more gangsters in the small than in the powerful nations. What do you mean by stability (which has plenty of meanings)?
I suppose that running an archive is a voluntary (self-sacrificing)
act of a benovolent person ready to offer his service to the public. If his site has to close down sometime later, he has to accept his bad luck. Why should you care so much minutely for him? (And you
say below that the money problem is trivial!)
So it rests to find people who have the time and (that small) money and energy to run sites and some countries that aren't going to
have strict cryto laws in the near future. THAT, however, is
difficult, I believe.

We were talking about a site that has to be closed because of (new)

And also you said that money is no problem!
Why you care so much about people who voluteer to run sites? They
certainly know what kind of risks that they probably face, financial
or otherwise. Do you care your neighbour who opens up a new company
and do you feel unconditionally have to give him advices?? Are you the one who is cleverer than all the others?
Then why did you tell me previously that the finacial problem is
nothing?? Any cite connected to the internet is certainly available
everywhere as long as the machine is up.
Remember the assumption is that a site is in a country which has
yet have no crypto laws. It then runs till that country poses
crypto laws. So you can exclude your example. If a country turns
out to be unstable than the effect is that we have one site less
from that time point. If there are plenty of sites, what problem
do you see??

Let me ask you some clear questions and please give me also clear
If there is some person who is grown up and is not metally ill
and who decides to volunteer to put up an archive site of crypto
software for the benefit of those who need them, what do you have
against that? Any reasonable person who plans to do some business (for profit) certainly well considers the possible risks he might
have. For non-profit activities like what we are discussing it is clear that one is much more careful before launching the work. Why do you want to disuade him from doing that? If he fails, that's his fate but you don't loose a cent because of that. If he puts up a site and that has to be closed down after a couple of months because of unforeseen new crypto laws, you at least profit in that short time period of the possibility of downloading from his site and other people also profit from that. If his country has poor economy (inflation, unemployment etc. leading possibly to early depletion of his monetary resources) or bad infrastucture (total breakdown of telecommunication of his country, rendering his site no longer operable) or religion (because he is physically injured by religious fanatics and therefore unable to work), or whatever other reasons
than these three that you mentioned, that's all HIS business not
YOURS. He, being in his own country, should know all such risks much
much better than you! Be happy that because of him you have one more possibilty of obtaining your desired software (during the time
his site is operational)! If he ever gets into trouble, it will be fine of you if you will try to help him, through raising funds etc. But you are not obliged to do that.
So I don't understand the motivation of your arguing up till now. I would be able to understand if you were working in an authority attempting to strengthen the effects of crypto laws, thus wishing to have as few archive sites in the world as possible, at best none. (Of course, I know absolutely nothing of you. Should I happen to have made here a wrong assumption about your occupation, then I like to offer my sincere apology.)

I don't know. But a number of years ago I accessed some archive sites of software for processing of Asian languages. From that and the
fact that modern disks have become much bigger in capacity and cheaper,
I suppose that storage shouldn't be a bottleneck.
I like to take the opportunity to mention a non-trivial issue that
happens to have refreshed my attention by a reader's letter in a
computer journal, namely that software at public archives could be
infected by virus. I suppose one should give this potential risk
some consideration, since in the present context there could be
some third party particularly interested in disrupting the goals
of crypto archives.
Another point I like to raise is what to archive, i.e. whether only
program texts (which are small) or also executable files, and how
to let the archive contents be up-to-date. Related to this is
whether the archive owner has to fetch everything himself or there is
also a directory for uploading by contributors (this is the case
with the archives I mentioned above and is sensible for new software
and for updates.)

least in my opinion, is their use of the word 'public domain' software, which most people understand to be software which anyone can download free of charge.

@_subject: WEAK3-EX -- A Layman's 56-bit Data Encryption Algorithm 
In the previous products of my WEAK series of data encryption algorithms I have very strongly exploited the possibility of using arbitrarily long keys. Since this conflicts with the recent requirement of using 56-bit keys, a new program, WEAK3-EX, has been designed specifically for users that can only use 56-bit encryption keys. The design draws upon various techniques that have been accumulated in the course of the development of the previous WEAK3-E.
Besides employing constant length 56-bit keys, a new feature that is introduced in WEAK3-EX is a user choosable scaling factor for the
initialization time of the algorithm. Normally the initialization
time of crypto algorithms are small and is for obvious reasons to be
reduced as far as technically possible. In fact, the initialization
time of almost all known encryption algorithms is negligible compared
to the proper record processing time. Our algorithm, which contains
author's compound PRNG, is however an exception to the rule. For,
depending on the number of the constituent generators of the compound
PRNG used, this can under circumstances indeed attain a non-trivial
value. This is till present a necessary evil of our WEAK3-E which now
fortunately in the special case of key length restriction (with the
obvious accompanying unfavourable strength reduction effect) can be
turned into a virtue of our new WEAK3-EX. In fact, if the (variable) parameters to be chosen by the user (in particular the number of rounds)
of our algorithm are adequate, brute force would be the only feasible
method of attack. Now the average time for brute force is equal to the
time of running a single encryption/decryption process multiplied by
one half of the size of the key space. If the initialization time of the
algorithm is increased, the time for brute forcing correspondingly
increases so that through suitable choice of the said scaling factor it
can reach practically infeasible value for analysis without however
on the other hand rendering the total processing time of the user (which of course also augments) to amounts entirely inacceptable for him. (The multiplying factor of one half of the key space is the leverage we exploit here.)
Technically, the scaling factor determines the number of pseudo-random
numbers retrieved from the shuffling buffer (of Bays and Duncan) that
are to be combined into one pseudo-random number through the addition
mod 1 operation (device of Wichmann and Hill) for subsequent
utilization in building up the constituent generators of author's
compound PRNG. The larger the scaling factor, the longer it will take
to build up the compound PRNG.
The multiple-seed standard PRNG employed in WEAK3-E is abandoned in
WEAK3-EX in order to comply with the 56-bit key restriction. In
its place is a standard PRNG that consists of two internal (single-seed)
PRNGs which are activated alternatingly and which each accepts a seed
of 28 bits, totalling 56 bits.
An implementation in Fortran 90 is given in
     Both source and a binary executable file for PC can be downloaded via
my main Web page.
I wish to thank CWL and ZFS for suggesting the use of the scaling

What I guess is very bad currently is that plenty of owners of the computer systems appear to be shy of facing squarely with the
problem and of conducting some direct tests to get at least some
real feeling of the problem that quite probably may occur. (It's
like one is not inclined to consult the doctors until the illness
becomes very grave. Certainly this is only my superficial observation. I may be very wrong.) Of course, such tests, if not well designed, may not deliver the hoped-for results. But having the courage to do some tests is anyway better than to avoid considering the problem till the day when Y2K really hurts. I am ignorant of how hard it is indeed to devise some realistic tests for Y2K. On the other hand, I can't imagine that these could be anything terribly difficult. If there are huge data bases involved, one could copy a part to a separate hardware and do experiments with it by entering data of Y2K and manipulating the system clock. If nothing happens, then one gains at least some assurance and can proceed to do more sophisticated tests. If something goes wrong, one knows directly what kind of misery one could expect to have at 2000 if the problem is ignored today and can thus energetically look for the remedy.
I speculate that most firms can start to do some tests with their
own staffs, i.e. without external consultants.

I don't see you have answered my question of whether a test has to
take into consideration how a sequence of numbers has been obtained.
Also what you wrote above seems to be less than clear. Do you suggest
that Mauerer's test is extremely good in deciding whether a sequence is TRULY random? (I think Maurer's test is good for investigating PRNG squences but maybe not used as a criterion between pseudo-
randomness and true randomness (whatever that may be defined)). What if some PRNGs pass Maurer's test?

@_subject: Is it true that PGP 5.X is not secure? 
My humble knowledge does not permit my answering your question.
However, I suppose your question is problematical. It is difficult
to define security, or more precisely a scientifcally rigorous
measure of security. I don't think that it is sensible to talk about absolute security without reference to a context (environment). In my view there is no 'perfect' encryption system in the practical
world. If by 'not secure' you meant something that malicious persons have secretely manipulated to cause you damage, then I also don't know but I guess that to be highly unlikely, given the good historical record of PGP. M. K. Shen

I suppose one should not forget one aspect if AES is to become an
ISO standard. There will be different implementations but one
needs validations. For compilers there are validation centres
run by certain institutes authorized by some national standard
organizations (certificates of validation are issued). Similar facilities should be assured for the future AES. Implementation as such can't in my opinion be a big problem outside of US.

If the 'mathematical magic' is not to be kept secret (as in principle
shouldn't for all crypto algorithms) then presumably one could
attack through brute forcing the 'remembered secrect', I guess.
(I suppose the 'remembered secret' has less bits then the 'password'
that is to be retrieved from the pool of millions with the
'mathematical magic'). So the advantages of the scheme appear to
remain unclear as a matter of principle.

I remember someone wrote of the case where the attacker got the
file with the millions of passwords. Then if he also knows the
'mathematical magic' he could presumably do offline work. So I
suppose that the 'mathematical magic' has to be kept secret, which would work against the generally accepted crypto principles.

I suppose you misunderstood me. I mean the 'mathematical magic'
cannot be made public. (Or is 'online protocol' = 'mathematical magic'?)
If the 'magic' is public then the attacker with the pool of passwords
could brute force offline.

@_subject: ArcotSign (was Re: Does security depend on hardware?) 
In that case please allow me to go back to a point raised by me
previously. The user uses his 'remembered secret' (of fewer bits) through a public algorithm (including protocol) to retrieve from a pool the password (of more bits). If the attacker doesn't have the pool then everything looks fine. But if he manages to get the pool
(a case someone mentioned in this thread) then he can obviously
brute force offline, I believe, since he possesses now everything
the legitimate user has, excepting the 'remembered secret'. Or is
there anything wrong with my logic?

@_subject: An Extended Version of My Encryption Algorithm WEAK3 
I have done a trial implementation of a number of suggestions received
for improving my encryption algorithm WEAK3 and have decided to
integrate a subset of these into WEAK3 to form an extended version of
it designated WEAK3-E. The added features are the following:
   1. Text block chaining. Two options are provided. These are similar       though not identical to the block chaining methods PBC and CBCC
      as described in B. Schneier's book.
   2. Another block chaining method that is specific to our scheme. It
      consists in modifying, depending on the text being processed, the
      pointers that are used to access the various pseudo-randomly
      generated tables of the algorithm.
   3. All pseudo-randomly generated tables used in the algorithm can now
      be refreshed at user specified periods.
   4. Checksums of the chaining values in (1) and (2) above are output
      to provide integrity checking.
An implementation in Fortran 90 is available in:
     The rationales of design of the base version, WEAK3, are given in
     The implemented new features largely follow the suggestions of CWL.
I like also to thank GR and CK for construcive critiques and TPS for
validating the program code. All eventual remaining deficiencies and
errors are however exclusively mine.

@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source co	de) 
But sadly in matters of law there are software patents and particularly
in cryptography. One may have different opinions on crypto patents
and endlessly debate on them. My personal opinion is that the
benefits of crypto patents do not outweigh their negative impacts
on the development and use of cryptography especially in view of the fact that a number of governments intend to suppress civilian usage of strong crypto with all means that they can think of.
I think that claiming copyright is a good idea, since one retains
some kind of control over the stuff that one creates. One can then say that copying is allowed for certain usages but disallowed in others. (As far as I know copying some pages from a book, but not
the whole, for scientific purposes is free generally.) M. K. Shen
