@_subject: PGP reveals  the key ID of the recipient of encrypted msg 
I began testing PGP  a few days ago ( I'm a PGP newbie ) and I found that it gives out the key ID of an encrypted message . From this you can get the  identification of the recipient of the message , if it's someone who has publicaly  distributed his  key (keyserver , homepage ...) . So even if you are unable to decode the message you  can find who is the recipient of a given message . I think this is a big privacy problem .
The problem is carried along when you encrypt a message for multiple  recipients , you get the key IDs of all the recipients and same problem as above .  I think something like 'blind email copy' should be used , because the recipients don't have to know the identity of each other .
Comments from long time PGPer  will be welcome

@_subject: TCP/IP Stego 
It seems that bit fiddling involve a direct connection of two partners having each one a TCP/IP Stego adapted kernel to work .
This is a direction to study , but we can't forget those who can't directly connect with their 'stego' partner . We can't forget also those who can't hack their kernel .
Any comment welcome

@_subject: PGP : what to do when a user ID has multiple RSA keys 
My DOS version of PGP 2.6.2 came with a built in PUBRING.PGP containing two keys ( 1024 and 512 size ) with the same user ID .
For testing  purposes I wanted to encrypt a message with the 512 length key , but only the 1024 size key could be used .
How can I select the right key , apart from making a clone PUBRING.PGP with only the key I want to use ?
Any comment welcome
