Just like that.
This Week's Questions
Question One
In a meeting with the boss, as captured forever in the pages
of "Dogbert's Top-Secret Management Handbook" ("DTSMH"),
Dilbert is told to add a sentence to his report saying that
micro-robotics is a dead-end technology. When he answers
that the statement would make the whole report a confusing
and senseless waste of time, the boss says:
A -- That's okay. We just won't let anybody else see it.
B -- That's part of our strategy.
C -- And your point is what?
Question Two
Discussing the quality assurance process with Ratbert (as
transcribed in a strip in "DTSMH"), the boss accuses him of
finding a huge number of flaws in the prototype,
jeopardizing the schedule. The possible results, according
to the boss, are:
A -- Mass layoffs will result.
B -- The entire project will fail and it's all your fault.
C -- This could be the end of civilization as we know it.
Question Three
Waxing rhapsodic over the advantages of using temporary
workers (as noted in a strip in "DTSMH"), the boss says:
A -- I just love hiring these temporary workers.
B -- No employee benefits...no union...just throw 'em in
the Dumpster when you're done with 'em.
C -- Both A and B.
Question Four
Asking the boss to delay the beta trial of a product until
it stops exploding, Dilbert is met with resistance, as
evidenced by this strip in "DTSMH":
A -- You engineers are such pessimists. Just once, try to
focus on the positive aspects of the trial.
B -- Is that a bad thing?
C -- Could we call that a feature?
