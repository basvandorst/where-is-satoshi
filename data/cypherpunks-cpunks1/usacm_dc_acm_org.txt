    COMPUTING SOCIETY RELEASES REPORT ON ENCRYPTION POLICY
      "CLIPPER CHIP" CONTROVERSY EXPLORED BY EXPERT PANEL
     WASHINGTON, DC � A panel of experts convened by the nation's foremost computing society today released a comprehensive report on U.S. cryptography policy.  The report, "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy," is the culmination of a ten-month review conducted by the panel of representatives of the computer industry and academia, government officials, and attorneys.  The 50-page document explores the complex technical and social issues underlying the current debate over the Clipper Chip and the export control of information security technology.
     "With the development of the information superhighway, cryptography has become a hotly debated policy issue," according to Joseph DeBlasi, Executive Director of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which convened the expert panel.  "The ACM believes that this report is a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the Clipper Chip and encryption policy.  It cuts through the rhetoric and lays out the facts."
     Dr. Stephen Kent, Chief Scientist for Security Technology with the firm of Bolt  Beranek and Newman, said that he was pleased with the final report.  "It provides a very balanced discussion of many of the issues that surround the debate on crypto policy, and we hope that it will serve as a foundation for further public debate on this topic."       The ACM report addresses the competing interests of the various stakeholders  in  the  encryption debate  --  law enforcement agencies,  the intelligence community, industry and users of communications services.  It reviews the recent history of U.S. cryptography policy and identifies key questions that policymakers must resolve as they grapple with this controversial      The ACM cryptography panel was chaired by Dr. Stephen Kent.  Dr. Susan Landau, Research Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, co-ordinated the work of the panel and did most of the writing. Other panel members were Dr. Clinton Brooks, Advisor to the Director, National Security Agency; Scott Charney, Chief of the Computer Crime Unit, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice; Dr. Dorothy Denning, Computer Science Chair, Georgetown University; Dr. Whitfield Diffie, Distinguished Engineer, Sun Microsystems; Dr. Anthony Lauck, Corporate Consulting Engineer, Digital Equipment Corporation; Douglas Miller, Government Affairs Manager, Software Publishers Association; Dr. Peter Neumann, Principal Scientist, SRI International; and David Sobel, Legal Counsel, Electronic Privacy Information Center.  Funding for the cryptography study was provided in part by the National Science Foundation.      The ACM, founded in 1947, is a 85,000 member non-profit educational and scientific society dedicated to the development and use of information technology, and to addressing the impact of that technology on the world's major social challenges.

     COMPUTER POLICY COMMITTEE CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF CLIPPER             COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY "TOO IMPORTANT" FOR                      SECRET DECISION-MAKING
     WASHINGTON, DC ��The public policy arm of the oldest and largest international computing society today urged the White House to withdraw the controversial "Clipper Chip" encryption proposal.  Noting that the "security and privacy of electronic communications are vital to the development of national and international information infrastructures," the Association for Computing Machinery's U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM) added its voice to the growing debate over encryption and privacy      In a position statement released at a press conference on Capitol Hill, the USACM said that "communications security is too important to be left to secret processes and classified algorithms."  The Clipper technology was developed by the National Security Agency, which classified the cryptographic algorithm that underlies the encryption device.  The USACM believes that Clipper "will put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage in the global market and will adversely affect technological development within the United States."   The technology has been championed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NSA, which claim that "non-escrowed" encryption technology threatens law enforcement and national security.
     "As a body concerned with the development of government technology policy, USACM is troubled by the process that gave rise to the Clipper initiative," said Dr. Barbara Simons, a computer scientist with IBM who chairs the USACM.  "It is vitally important that privacy protections for our communications networks be developed openly and with full public participation."
     The USACM position statement was issued after completion of a comprehensive study of cryptography policy sponsored by the ACM (see companion release).  The study, "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy," was prepared by a panel of experts representing various constituencies involved in the debate over      The ACM, founded in 1947, is a 85,000 member non-profit educational and scientific society dedicated to the development and use of information technology, and to addressing the impact of that technology on the world's major social challenges.

   =============================================================
       USACM Position on the Escrowed Encryption Standard
The ACM study "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy" sets forth the complex technical and social issues underlying the current debate over widespread use of encryption.  The importance of encryption, and the need for appropriate policies, will increase as networked communication grows.  Security and privacy of electronic communications are vital to  the development of national and international information The Clipper Chip, or "Escrowed Encryption Standard" (EES) Initiative, raises fundamental policy issues that must be fully addressed and publicly debated.  After reviewing the ACM study, which provides a balanced discussion of the issues, the U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM (USACM) makes the following   1.  The USACM supports the development of public policies and technical standards for communications security in open forums in which all stakeholders -- government, industry, and the public -- participate.  Because we are moving rapidly to open networks, a prerequisite for the success of those networks must be standards for which there is widespread consensus, including international acceptance.  The USACM believes that communications security is too important to be left to secret processes and classified algorithms.  We support the principles underlying the Computer Security Act of 1987, in which Congress expressed its preference for the development of open and unclassified security standards.
  2.  The USACM recommends that any encryption standard adopted by the U.S. government not place U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage in the global market or adversely affect technological development within the United States.  Few other nations are likely to adopt a standard that includes a classified algorithm and keys escrowed with the U.S. government.
  3.  The USACM supports changes in the process of developing Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) employed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  This process is currently predicated on the use of such standards solely to support Federal procurement.  Increasingly, the standards set through the FIPS process directly affect non-federal organizations and the public at large.  In the case of the EES, the vast majority of comments solicited by NIST opposed the standard, but were openly ignored.  The USACM recommends that the standards process be placed under the Administrative Procedures Act so that citizens may have the same opportunity to challenge government actions in the area of information processing standards as they do in other important aspects of Federal agency policy making.
  4.  The USACM urges the Administration at this point to withdraw the Clipper Chip proposal and to begin an open and public review of encryption policy.  The escrowed encryption initiative raises vital issues of privacy, law enforcement, competitiveness and scientific innovation that must be openly discussed.
  5.  The USACM reaffirms its support for privacy protection and urges the administration to encourage the development of technologies and institutional practices that will provide real privacy for future users of the National Information

The Honorable John McCain
Senate Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee
241 Russell Senate Office Bldg.
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Mr. Chairman:
The U.S. Public Policy Office for the Association for Computing (USACM) and
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-United States
Activities (IEEE-USA) note with considerable dismay the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee's recent approval of S. 909, the
"Secure Public Networks Act."
We share many of the concerns of the Committee members regarding problems
of national security and law enforcement.   However, we believe that the
"Secure Public Networks Act," as approved by the Committee, leads U.S.
encryption policy in the wrong direction.   The proposed bill stands in
opposition to the scientific and professional opinions of many experts who
believe that national security and public safety will be weakened by the
mandated introduction of constrained or recoverable-key encryption.  We
also believe that such action will hinder U.S. competitiveness in
international markets, establish a dangerous precedent for the future, and
endanger cherished civil liberties in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
Since no hearings were held on the bill, the Committee may not have had
full information on its implications.
We believe the bill will have a serious, negative and long-term impact on
society in general and on our organizations and their members.  We are
keenly interested in supporting significant consideration of the important
issues involved, and we would very much like to provide technical and
scientific input on this issue.  Many of our members are
internationally-recognized experts in the area of information security and
encryption, and several have significant experience with law enforcement
and national security issues.  We would be happy to put you in contact with
some of these experts should you desire more information on the points we
outline in this letter.
In what follows, we  briefly outline some of the reasons why so many
experts believe such a bill is harmful if it became law.
        - 2 -
First, the bill is economically harmful.  Voting to restrict strong
cryptography would damage America's dominance in information technologies.
Secure software and hardware is available overseas.  Mathematical acumen
exists around the world; the U.S. can neither control nor contain it.
Software companies will continue to be forced to seek talent elsewhere.
The widely-used, strong cryptographic algorithm IDEA, for example, was
developed in Europe.  U.S. software and hardware suppliers can incorporate
IDEA into their products, but only if those products are confined to use in
the U.S.   Export controls have obviously not hindered the worldwide spread
of encryption products based on IDEA and produced outside the U.S.  These
controls have merely prevented U.S. providers from participating in that
global market.  Customers throughout the world have the sophistication to
understand the need for strong cryptographic products and they will
continue to seek to buy them wherever they are sold.  The result will be an
increasing loss of jobs and revenues in an area where the U.S. once held
the dominant position.  It is conceivable that our own industry and
civilian sector might eventually become dependent on foreign cryptography
products should U.S.  firms continue to be prohibited from open competition
in this arena.
Second, this bill threatens cherished civil freedoms.  Information
technologies make data surveillance possible and increasingly affordable.
The best technical protections available to the individual depend upon
cryptography.  There is also an unfortunate history of a few law
enforcement agents and government officials using their positions and
access to violate the law and the rights of citizens.  Strong encryption is
the only practical means available to law-abiding citizens to defend
themselves against these infrequent, but all-too-real abuses.
The wording in the proposed bill for organizations with Federal funding to
rely on a mandated form of encryption will be burdensome and may lead to
severe invasions of privacy.  For instance, if a library or university were
forced to implement such encryption, how could the organization ensure that
its users were actually employing the system?  The only sure method would
be to "snoop" on the messages to see if they were breakable under the
mandated scheme.  Otherwise, users would be able to substitute their own
encryption instead of, or in addition to, the mandated form, thus rendering
this bill meaningless but still costly to implement.  This raises serious
questions about privacy -- and more importantly -- First Amendment
Third, the criminal element will not be hindered by any legislation similar
to the one proposed.  The referenced bill provides no provisions that would
actually deter criminals from employing strong encryption obtained from
other sources.    Drug cartels, terrorists, pornographers and others who
might use encryption in criminal enterprises are already violating laws
with penalties much more severe than any that might be imposed for using
unauthorized encryption technologies.  Meanwhile, law-abiding citizens
would be forced to rely on technologies that might not protect their
private information against "crackers" and potential blackmailers.  As in
the physical world, the best public safety results from crime prevented
through good practices, rather than crimes solved.  Without strong
cryptography Americans cannot lock their electronic doors, but must instead
remain vulnerable.  Thus, constraining cryptography might help law
enforcement solve a small number of crimes, but it will do nothing to
prevent opportunities for even more crimes, thereby reducing overall public
Fourth, constraints on strong cryptography will jeopardize national
security.  Requiring or encouraging weakened technology leaves the United
States vulnerable to information warfare from other nation-states,
techno-anarchists and terrorists, and from organized criminal elements.  It
is vital that telephone systems, medical health care systems, utility
systems, and other control mechanisms affecting every sector of the economy
be made more secure and not restrained from using improved security.  Our
national security depends on the reliability of our
        - 3 -
national infrastructures and critical systems, particularly those based on
computer and communications technology.  To legislate the use of untested
mechanisms that present weakened protection, or that have a single point of
failure and attack, will unnecessarily endanger those critical institutions
and the people who depend on them.  Those same forces arrayed against our
national interests will be freely able to obtain stronger cryptography
technology from the many other countries that do not place restrictions on
its development and sale.
Fifth, information technologies change quickly.  We don't want to require
enabling legislation whenever advances in technology increase the
vulnerability of current key lengths.  The recent cracking of 56-bit DES in
the RSA challenge shows that distributed computing power is now available
to break this key length, thus identifying a need for larger keys.  A
breakthrough in mathematics, such as increasing the speed of factoring
numbers, would require a prompt response, such as increasing key lengths or
changing algorithms.  The proposed legislation would severely discourage
such changes.  Additionally, by preventing the initial acquisition of
strong encryption technology, the need for near-term upgrades to defeat
improved cracking techniques is almost assured,  as are the extra financial
As a last point, consider the implicit message sent by passage of this act
or any like it.  The U.S. has long been a vocal proponent of freedom of
speech and other civil rights for citizens around the world.  Why should
any other nation's leaders heed further such rhetoric if the U.S. adopts
the proposed bill?  If some foreign nation with a history of oppression
were to pass the same legislation so as to eavesdrop on their citizens'
communications for purposes of  identifying human rights activities, we
would register strong disapproval.  With passage of legislation such as the
"Secure Public Networks Act" the U.S. loses the moral high ground in any
future such scenario.
In summary, our professional position is that  passage of the "Secure
Public Networks Act" or similar legislation is ill-advised; we urge you to
defeat this bill.   Instead, we encourage passage of legislation such as
Senator Conrad Burns' Pro-CODE bill, or Representative Bob Goodlatte's SAFE
bill as a better, more effective aid to national security, law enforcement
and civil rights.

USACM SIGNS AMICUS BRIEF IN CRYPTOGRAPHY CASE
USACM has joined 14 other groups and three distinguished computer security
experts and cryptographers to sign a brief on encryption submitted to the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein v. State Department case. The
case challenges the constitutionality of export controls of encryption. In
a lower court decision issued in August, Judge Marilyn Patel ruled that
source code is protected by the First Amendment.
LEADING U.S. SCIENCE GROUPS PROTEST CRYPTO RESTRICTIONS
On September, 24 the leading U.S. scientific, mathematics, and engineering
societies sent a
united message to Congress protesting proposed U.S. cryptography policies
that would maintain export restrictions limiting the open exchange of
scientific information and the progress of scientific research and
development.  In addition, these organizations warned that new requirements
for domestic key recovery raise serious scientific and technical problems
that undermine its viability as a policy alternative.  In a letter to the
House Commerce Committee, the societies indicated that the policies will
"diminish the scientific reputation of the United States and weaken us
This is the first time these highly influential societies have united to
inform Congress how cryptography policies will effect the future of
scientific research and development in the U. S.  Until now,  the debate
has focused on commercial, civil liberties, and national security/ law
enforcement interests. The letter urges the Committee to reject restrictive
proposals or " U.S. leadership in many areas of  science and technology is
likely to be jeopardized with no discernible benefits to our National
USACM MEETS WITH CONGRESSIONAL STAFF
On October 9 and 10, USACM Chairperson Barbara Simons met with staffers
from Sen. Boxer, Sen. Feinstein, Sen. Kerry, Rep. Eshoo, and Rep.
Campbell's offices to discuss U.S. cryptography policy.  Simons discussed
both California Resolution SJR29 which  sets forth the Legislature's
vigorous disagreement with the Administration's crypto export policy and
the letter from the scientific societies.
USACM TO SPONSOR ACM POLICY 98 CONFERENCE
USACM is sponsoring the ACM Policy '98 Conference to be held May 10-12 in

and journalism. Leading experts in the field will be invited to discuss,
debate, and develop policies to manage the impact of these technologies to
produce outcomes beneficial to society. The co-chairs of the conference are
Ben Shneiderman, USACM and C. Dianne Martin, SIGCAS and the conference is
being held in cooperation with SIGCAS, SIGGRAPH, and SIGCHI.
The conference will feature discussions on Universal Access, Electronic
Commerce, Intellectual Property, and Learning Online.  The panel
coordinators are USACM members David Farber, Jim Horning,  Pam Samuelson,
and Chuck Brownstein.
POLICY BRIEFS
CONGRESS TO RETHINK U.S. SCIENCE POLICY
On Oct. 23,  Congressman Vern Ehlers (R-Mich), Vice Chairman of the House
Science Committee, began an effort to redefinine U.S. Science Policy  for
the next century.  The project was initiated by Rep. Newt Gingrich, who
requested that the House Science Committee develop a new, post-Cold War,
paradigm for national science policy. Ehlers convened a meeting of
distinguished policy experts including the Presidents of the National
Academies of Science and Engineering; the President, Vice-President,
Chairman, plus a Senior Fellow from the Council on Competitiveness; leaders
of the Sandia and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories; the retired
President of Hewlett Packard Corporation; and the President of MIT.
This project offers novel opportunities for scientists and science policy
makers to be involved in the creation of a new paradigm for US science
policy. Vice Chairman Ehlers has set up a web site that will provide
information on this year-long effort and where he will solicit comments on
developing the new policy outline.  First, he is planning to post a
mission/challenge statement and then will begin fashioning a draft science
policy statement.  Beginning in the early summer 1998, he will hold
hearings on the statement.  Subsequently, he will submit the final science
policy document and it will hopefully be adopted as a concurrent resolution
of the Congress. NEW NET DECENCY BILL INTRODUCED IN SENATE
Senator Dan Coates (R-IN) introduced S. 1482 on November 8. The bill
criminalizes commercial distribution of materials "harmful to minors" on
the Internet.  Under the statute, commercial online distributors of
material deemed "harmful to minors" could be punished with up to six months
in jail and a $50,000 fine unless they have developed age verification or
credit card processing systems.  This is a second iteration of the
Communications Decency Act which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional
this past summer.
COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION INTRODUCED
Sen. John Ashcroft (Mi.) has introduced Digital Copyright Clarification and
Technology Education Act of 1997, S. 1145, a comprehensive bill that
provides implementing legislation for the WIPO Copyright Treaty passed last
year.  The bill contains three separate titles covering, OSP/ISP Liability,
Technology for Teachers and Librarians, and WIPO Implementation.
The OSP/ISP Liability section would clarify that merely providing network
services and facilities for transmitting an electronic communication will
not result in liability under the Copyright Act; confirm that providing a
site-linking aid, a navigational aid (including a search engine or
browser), or the tools for creating a site-linking aid will not result in
liability under the Copyright Act; clarify that Internet and on-line
service providers will not be liable for third-party copyright infringement
unless they have received notice and have a reasonable opportunity to limit
the third-party infringement; and confirm that an employee of an
educational institution, library, or archives will not be deemed to have
received notice and thus will not be required to "take down" an allegedly
infringing work if she believed the use was a fair use or otherwise lawful.
The WIPO Implementation title implements provisions of two international
copyright treaties adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization.
The WIPO treaties oblige signatory nations to offer legal protection
against circumvention of technology intended to protect copyrighted
material against infringement, but do not require the broad prohibition of
software or devices that might be used by infringers.  Section 1201 would
only create liability for a person who--for purposes of infringing a
copyrighted work--knowingly circumvents the application of an effective
anti-copying measure used to protect a work in a digital format.  Section
1202 would create liability for a person who knowingly provides false
copyright management information or who removes or alters copyright
management information without the authority of the copyright owner.
NRC SOLICITS COMMENTS ON INFORMATION LITERACY
The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National
Research Council is undertaking a project "to explicate the various
dimensions of what might be called information technology (IT) literacy,
i.e., what everyone needs to know about information technology.  A major
part of the project's task is to develop a consensus for the appropriate
definitions of "everyone", "know", and "information technology"." The
committee responsible for this project is chaired by Larry Snyder,
professor of computer science and engineering at the University of
Because the subject of IT literacy is subject to many differing opinions,
the committee has developed a number of questions for which it hopes to
generate a broad response.  Sets of questions have been developed for
computer and communications scientists and engineers, employers and labor
professionals, librarians, K-12 educators, and other groups.  The committee
invites you to submit your answers to these questions in the form of a
short position paper.  For more information, see
PROPOSED DATABASE PROTECTION LEGISLATION
Chairman Coble has introduced H.R. 2652, the Collections of Information
Antipiracy Act.  This database bill is designed as a misappropriation bill,
not a sui generis protection bill which had previously been proposed.  In
other words, it in theory does not create a property right in the database;
it simply prohibits the unfair use of the data one has collected.  As this
bill is drafted, however, there is little to distinguish it from a sui
generis protection bill.
Historically, the misappropriation approach in the U.S. is based on the
Supreme Court's holding that the state common law of misappropriation was
not preempted by the copyright law when it covered *hot news.*  This
doctrine was explained in the recent NBA v. Motorola case, where the Court
listed five conditions for misappropriation not to be preempted.  However,
H.R. 2652 appears far broader than the traditional misappropriation
doctrine. Significantly, traditional misappropriation is limited to time
sensitive information, while H.R. 2652 applies to all information.  Also,
the definitions in the statute are extremely vague.   The bill contains
several exceptions and exclusions, but they appear limited. Finally, H.R.
2652 contains civil and criminal penalties ($500,000 penalty and 10 years
in jail).
H.R. 2652 expressly does not extend to computer programs, but this
exclusion "does not apply to a collection of information directly or
indirectly incorporated in a computer program."  There are numerous
interpretations to that language.  For example,  would a command structure
be viewed as a collection of information incorporated in a program?  Or,
what about a look-up table for translation purposes?  One could argue that
the phrase "collection of information ... incorporated in a computer
program" refers to information related to the application rather the
functioning of the program itself.  For example, in a program designed to
determine structural stress, the engineering constants in the program would
be protected, while the interface specifications would not.  This
interpretation, however, is not clear from the face of the statute.
NATIONAL RESEARCH INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998 INTRODUCED
On November 7, Sens. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Gramm (R-Texas) introduced S.
1305, the National Research Investment Act of 1998. The Act is designed to
reverse a downward trend in the federal government's allocation to science
and engineering research by authorizing the doubling of federal research
spending over the next ten years. According to Sen. Lieberman, "...Publicly
funded science has shown to be surprisingly important to the innovation
system. A new study prepared for the National Science Foundation found that
73 percent of the main science papers cited by American industrial patents
in two recent years were based on domestic and foreign research financed by
governments or nonprofit agencies."  He continued, "Yet, despite the
demonstrated importance of publicly funded scientific research, the amount
spent on science and engineering by the Federal Government is declining.
Senator Gramm has already noted that  in 1965, 5.7 percent of the Federal
budget was spent on non defense research and development. Thirty-two years
later, that figure has dropped by two-thirds to 1.9 percent."
On November 12, S. 1305, was discussed at a conference in Washington.  A
member of Senator Gramm's staff indicated that  passage of S. 1305 is
"going to be very difficult."  That is why the Bill supports a ten
yearperiod during which federal spending on R&D will continue to grow until
it is doubled in 2008.  S. 1305 differs from Gramm's previous bill because
of its bipartisan support.  Having both a Democratic and a Republican
original cosponsors will help to reassure other senators.
Also participating in this session were speakers from the AAAS and the
Office of Management and Budget.  AAAS recently calculated that total
federal R&D for FY 1998 increased 3.9% over last year.  Basic research
support increased by 4.0% (both figures subject to change as remaining
appropriations bill are passed.)   The OMB official predicted that
previously forecasted dramatic cuts in federal support for R&D seem
unlikely, as is a doubling of future federal support.
DIGITAL SIGNATURES DISCUSSED IN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
The Senate Banking and House Science Committee held hearings on October 28
on digital signatures. The witnesses at the hearings recommended that any
bill proposed be limited in its scope. They argued that since many
companies are using digital signatures for different reasons, it would be
premature for Congress to pass far- reaching legislation. Andrew Pincus
from the Commerce Department noted "it seems unlikely that the market will
settle on one universal authentication mechanism." Senator Robert Bennett
(R-UT) announced that he is planning to introduce legislation early next
FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT SEEN AS CRUCIAL TO SCIENCE EDUCATION REFORM
Efforts are being made to improve U.S. K-12 science and math education.
An October 29  House Science Committee hearing reviewed the federal role in
improving science education and asked the question: is the federal
government coordinating its many programs for maximum effectiveness?
Committee Vice Chair Vern Ehlers (R-MI), who has run this series of
hearings, blamed the lack of a  national consensus for the current
"fragmented, mile-wide and inch-deep science and math curricula" that
students face.  He believes the federal government should play a role in
correcting this trend.
At an October 8 hearing in the same series, three experts in the field of
science education were invited to discuss the lessons learned from TIMMS,
the Third International Mathematics and Science Study which analyzed
international achievement in math and science at several grade levels.  The
TIMMS results showed that US fourth-graders performed above the
international average in math and were second only to South Korea in
science.  But by eighth grade, US students performed only slightly above
the international average in science and below the average in math.  This
drop in achievement from fourth to eighth grade, said TIMMS National
Research Coordinator William Schmidt, demonstrated that "US students don't
start out behind the rest of the world, but fall behind during the middle
school years."   All three witnesses attributed this failing of US math and
science education to the lack of a national consensus on what should be
taught at each grade.
PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION RELEASES INFOWAR REPORT
The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection released
its final report on November 5.  The report recommends increased spending
for computer security and training and warns that currently, most major
U.S. infrastructures which depentd on computer systems are unprotected. In
a controversial section, it recommended that key escrow/recovery systems be
adopted.  The report was heavily criticized by industry representatives in
hearings before the House and Senate.  USACM member Peter Neumann testified
about the report before the House Science Committee on November 6, 1997
criticizing numerous findings of the Commision..
The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was
established in July 1996 to examine both physical and electronic cyber
threats to eight key U.S. infrastructures (energy, telecommunications,
banking and finance, transportation, gas and oil storage, water supply
systems, government services and emergency service). The Commission will
develop a comprehensive national strategy for infrastructure assurance.
The full report is available at NOMINATIONS AND NEW APPOINTMENTS
The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee was
established under Executive Order 12382 to provide the President with
technical information and advice on national  security telecommunications
policy. The committee is composed of  no more than 30 members who have
particular knowledge and expertise  in the field of  telecommunications and
who represent elements of the Nation's telecommunications industry. The
President appointed Mr. Charles R. Lee and Mr. Van B. Honeycutt to the
The Advisory Committee on High Performance Computing and Communications,
Information Technology, and The Next Generation Internet will provide
valuable guidance and advice on all areas of high performance computing,
communications, and information technologies to the President, the Office
of Science and Technology Policy, and the Federal agencies involved in the
Computing, Information, and Communications R & D, including the Next
Generation Internet Initiative.  They will also provide valuable guidance
on the Administration's efforts to accelerate development and adoption of
Information technologies that will be vital for American prosperity in the
21st century.  The President announced his intent to appoint Mr. David W.
Dorman, Dr. Joe F. Thompson, Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, and Dr. John P.
Miller to the Committee.
President Clinton announced his intent to appoint Dr. Jeffrey Jaffe, Mayor
Sharon Sayles Belton, Norman Mineta, and Joseph Holmes as Members to the
Advisory Committee to the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection.  The Advisory Committee, which is made up of infrastructure
industry executives and private-sector leaders will advise and support the
President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection.

COMPUTER SCIENTISTS URGE PRESIDENT CLINTON TO VETO LEGISLATION
RESTRICTING FLOW OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
Computer scientists fear that legislation rushed through in the closing
days of Congress may inadvertently criminalize many scientific publications
that are freely available on the Internet today. They are calling on the
President to veto the measure.
The Association for Computing's U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM) said
that the legislation could lead to criminal prosecutions against
scientists, educators and others who do nothing more than share their own
articles on the Internet with students and colleagues.  According to USACM
Chair Dr. Barbara Simons, "This legislation was hurried through Congress,
was poorly drafted, and is likely to have many unintended consequences."
The "No Electronic Theft Act" would criminalize the copying of materials
which are currently protected under the well established U.S. doctrine of
Fair-Use. According to the Act, any person who infringes a copyright
willfully, by the electronic reproduction or distribution of one or more
copies which have a total retail value of more than $1000 dollars, will be
subject to a criminal prosecution.
The scientists say that an essential element of research is that papers
be reviewed by others.  Scientists submit papers describing their research
to scientific journals which facilitate the peer-review process.  The
journals then print the reviewed papers and thus own their copyrights.
Since the Internet's development, researchers have used it to make their
research widely available to others in their field.  According to the
letter, "Under the No Electronic Theft Act, an author who posts their
research on the Internet, and whose documents are frequently read on-line,
could be subject to criminal prosecution."
USACM argues that the No Electronic Theft Act will have a chilling effect
upon the free speech of scientists and professionals in universities and
research labs.  Universities may forbid scientists from publishing their
research on- line, or reading and reviewing other scientist's research
on-line, to avoid the potential of massive copyright litigation.
According to Dr. Simons "This legislation is clearly contrary
to the White House's stated goal of avoiding Internet regulation. We
believe it is inconsistent with the Administration's policy to promote
dramatically expansive laws for the Internet where other less burdensome
means may be available to address copyright concerns."
The Association for Computing (ACM) is the largest and oldest professional
association of computer scientists in the United States.  ACM's U.S. Public
Policy Committee (USACM) facilitates communications between computer
scientists and policy makers on issues of concern to the computing community.

Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Clinton:
believes that the  "No Electronic Theft Act" (H.R. 2265), which is now
before you, does not adequately reflect the nature of the new digital
environment and will have a  negative impact on the rich scientific
communications that have developed on the Internet in many fields,
including computer science.  For this reason, we are asking you to veto the
legislation. We agree that copyright holders have a legitimate need to
protect their intellectual property.  However,  we are concerned that the
bill was rushed through both Houses of Congress without careful
consideration of its unintended consequences.
*	Restrict scientists and other professionals from making their
research available on the Internet for use by colleagues and students.
Most scientists do not own the copyright on their own materials.  Instead,
that copyright ownership is retained by the scientific journal which
peer-reviews and publishes the research.  Under the No Electronic Theft
Act, an author who posts their research on the Internet, and whose
documents are frequently read on-line, could be subject to criminal
prosecution.  If the bill becomes law, scientists may have to choose
between having their work peer-reviewed or making it widely available.
*	Criminalize the transfer of information that is currently protected
under the U.S. 'fair use' doctrine.  Copyright law is derived from the U.S.
Constitution and is intended to advance "science and the useful arts."  The
fair-use doctrine protects reading and nonprofit copying and thus allows
scientists and educators to openly exchange information.  H.R. 2265 does
not explicitly protect the "fair use" privilege which makes this open
exchange of scientific information possible.
*	Chill free speech in universities and research labs. The
terminology used in the Bill, including "willfully" and "for profit," are
not defined; it is unclear what the parameters of a criminally prosecutable
copyright infringement are.  As a result, it is likely that many
institutions will mandate that all copyrighted documents be removed from
the net to avoid having to defend copyright infringement prosecutions.

USACM APPLAUDS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR UNANIMOUSLY
ENDORSING RELAXED EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION
As the Congress prepares to address the issue of computer
security and privacy, the California legislature has sent
a clear message that relaxing controls on cryptography is
a critical first step.
On September 5, the California legislature passed a
resolution that calls on the California members in
Congress to support legislation that would make it easier
for US companies to develop and market strong cryptography
products. The resolution was sponsored by Representative
Vasconcellos (D. San Jose) and passed without opposition.
Dr. Barbara Simons, chair of the policy committee for
the Association for Computing (USACM), said that the
California resolution makes clear that industry and
users are united in support of good cryptography.
"We believe that Congress should support the Security
and Freedom Act, sponsored by Representative Goodlatte.
The legislation will help protect security and privacy
on the internet. It will be a serious mistake for the
administration to oppose the development of this
technology," said Dr. Simons.
On August 26, USACM Chair Barbara Simons spoke in support
of the Vasconcellos resolution before a California Senate
committee. Also participating at the Committee hearing were
Dr. Whit Diffie from Sun, Kelly Blough from PGP, Jack Wilson of
ACL Datacom, Chuck Marson representing the California Internet
Industry Alliance (Netscape, Microsoft, AOL, CompuServe and
 Netcom), and a representative of the Software Publishers
Association.  Undersecretary of Commerce Reinsch wrote a
letter opposing the resolution.
The Association for Computing (ACM) is an international non-profit
educational and scientific society with 76,000 members worldwide,
 60,000 of whom reside in the U.S.  USACM, the Association for
Computing's U.S. Public Policy Office, serves as the focal point
for ACM's interaction with U.S. government organizations,
