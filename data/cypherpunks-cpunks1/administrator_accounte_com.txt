@_subject: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! RAVE IT!! 
IT WAS SO WEIRD,
I LOOK IN THE SEARCH ENGINE AND TYPED IN "DJETERNALAND" (WITHOUT TYPING WWW.COM) AND FOUND THIS SITE THAT WAS LIKE A SCARY MOVIE INTRO.I DONT KNOW IF IT WAS MSN OR YAHOO BUT ANYWAY,,
I WENT THERE AND THERE WAS LIKE TV CHANNELS OR SOMETHING WITH MUSIC, MIXES AND STUFF..
I GOT SOME SPAM FROM THAT SITE A WHILE AGO AND AT FIRST I HATED IT BUT.AS I SEE IT ITS KINDA KOOL. DIDNT MEAN TO BOTHER YOU I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD LET YOU KNOW..
(YOU CAN FIND ALOT OF THINGS IF YOU JUST TYPE IT IN THE ADDRESS BOX. JUST THE WORD AND THATS IT!)
BYE NOW
