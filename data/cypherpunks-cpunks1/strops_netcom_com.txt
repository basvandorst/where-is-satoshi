@_subject: Remailer Musings 
It seems to me the obvious solution to this problem, is for someone (with the means & incentive) to set up remailers in countries outside the jurisdictions of the US (and other countries with similar copyright laws) that simply REFUSE to track points or origin.  Yes, the remailer has to be capable of determining point of origin in order to be able to function, but by no means must it be set up to do so.  The world is a big place, and don't think it would be too dificult to find a place where the local authorities would have no interest in enforcing US copyright laws. Or maybe we can talk Bill Gates into installing a T1 to antarctica ;-)

I would also strongly recommend including a good windows front-end like PWF20, and maybe PGPShell 3.0 for dos users.  While pgp is technically a fine program, learning all of its command line flags can be daunting for a new user.  I know I would use it much less often without WinFront.

yes, they're called divertors and they give you a dialtone from which you can then dial out from.  how can you find one?  Good question...the best thing to do is get yourself a copy of toneloc and start scanning exchanges for dialtones.  if you find one, they often require you to dial 9, or 99 to get a live dialtone.  Is this legal?  another good question... it would depend on who owns the line and if they mind you using it, I suppose. :-)
