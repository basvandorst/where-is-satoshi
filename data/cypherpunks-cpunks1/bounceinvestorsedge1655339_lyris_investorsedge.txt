        Company History
                    THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY SERVES ALL FAITHS, TRADITIONS, AND CULTURES
        The Neptune SocietyÂ® (Pink Sheets: NTUN) is a high visibility brand name that has become
        the logical option to the traditional funeral and burial. The company has become
        synonymous with the simplicity, dignity, and economic feasibility of cremation and the
        scattering of ashes at sea. The company has been in operation since 1972 and has sold
        more than 80,000 Pre-Need contracts to date. All personnel & facilities of the Neptune
        Society are licensed and inspected by the governing state.
        On October 14, 1999, the board of directors elected Marco Markin to the positions of
        President and CEO.  Mr. Markin has an extensive background in the areas of operational
        management, business development and mergers and acquisitions.  Under Mr. Markins
        direction the Neptune Society has posted a 100% increase in revenues. The company
        currently operates 18 offices in seven states with gross sales approaching $20 million.
        The Neptune Society has had extensive, positive press coverage recently with archived
        stories in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today - Money section, The New York Times On The
        Web, and the Los Angeles Business Journal.
        Neptune Revenues
        [Image]   INCOME RESULTS THAT ARE VERY POSITIVE, VERY PROFITABLE, AND VERY PREDICTABLE
        The Society has four income streams: Recurring trust fund fees and yields, Pre-Need
        contracts, At-Need contracts, and Non-member contracts. Approximately 50% of the
        revenues of the Pre-Need plans are placed in a state approved and regulated trust fund.
        Neptune currently has close to $40 million held in trust from Pre-Need sales. That trust
        will grow to nearly $50 million by the end of the year 2002. The trust fund maintains
        its capital base and growth by serving At-Need fulfillment withdrawals having been
        compensated by the interest generated. Neptune also receives a 4.0% trust management
        fee. The company has guaranteed book business for 13 years and interest income on
        Pre-Need sales accrue to Neptune and is realized at the time of fulfillment. Neptune has
        sold 80,000 pre-need contracts since its inception and its year-over-year sales rate has
        never been in the red. The company currently has nearly 60,000 active contracts.
        Currently, new members are being added at a rate of over 1,000 per month, up from only
        400 per month in 1998, and Neptune handles nearly 7,000 At-Need cases annually, which
        makes them the largest cremation company in the U.S.
        The Industry
         THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY IS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY DEALING SOLELY IN
                                               CREMATION
        The death-care industry generates approximately $15 billion a year. It is however
        tremendously fragmented with 75% of the market being privately owned and the 6 largest
        providers comprising less than 25% of the industry. 24% of all Americans have
        pre-arranged some details of their own funeral and 80% believe pre-arranging is a good
        idea. Cremation accounted for 26.3% of all funeral services in 1999 with expectations of
        two out of every five, or 42% by 2010 (according to the Cremation Society of America).
        The average cost of a typical casket and burial funeral now exceeds $7,000 and the cost
        of a direct cremation runs from $799 to $1,299.
                                                [Image]
        The Market
        "THERE ARE ONLY TWO CERTAINTIES; DEATH AND TAXES"
        -- Benjamin Franklin
        The growth driver of the post-life market is the U.S. death rate and 72 million aging
        baby boomers who are now in their 50Âs. For the upscale market, some funerals can cost
        $30,000. The Neptune Society can provide upscale goods and services as well including:
        memorial services at a Neptune Society chapel and private service sea scattering with
        clergy and family and friends present.
        Cremation is the most common form of disposition in England (70%), Japan (98%), and
        Hawaii (58%) and cremation rates will steadily climb from 15% in 1987 to an estimated
        50% by the year 2020. Cremation is taking away market share from traditional burials,
        increasing from 6% in 1975, to 24% in 1998 and projected to 38% by 2010. The Neptune
        Society serves customers in 35 metro areas and currently has seven locations in
        California (including its corporate offices), three in Florida, two in New York, two in
        Iowa, two in Washington State, one in Arizona, and two in Oregon. The company will be
        expanding its presence to Colorado, Idaho, Texas, New Mexico, Illinois, Nebraska, and
        Kansas in the next three years.
        Neptune Marketing
                            NEPTUNE CONVERTS 25% OF ITS LEADS INTO CONTRACTS
        With the cost of a cremation being up to one-seventh less expensive than a traditional
        funeral, baby boomers tend to pre-pay for services. The Neptune society sends out over
        3.6 million mailers a year and will send out 6 million in 2001. They receive a
        approximately 1% response of which 25-28% have been converted into a Pre-Need contract.
        The company targets adults 54+ that have an income of $30k or more with a mailer and
        follow up calls are made from a dedicated call center based in Phoenix, AZ that has 20
        representatives. Remarkably, statistics prove a closure rate of 70-85% for in-home
        visits. They set up approximately 1,500 appointments a month through Neptune offices.
        There is no up selling to traditional casket and burial arrangements.

        Dear Investor
        Over the last year, investors have often suffered through the
        daily roller coaster of the stock market, a roller coaster whose
        wheels rest soundly in the tech sector. Investors have been
        watching their positions dwindle as common sense returned to the
        market and words like ÂrevenuesÂ and ÂearningsÂ once again had
        meaning.
        Today, the market seems abuzz with the pursuit of a catchy
        phrase, Âupside potential.Â We assume that means future
        profitability and growth. In contrast to the carefree tech run of
        the recent past, upside potential must now be combined with a
        sturdy business plan tested over more than a quarter. You just
        canÂt add Âdot comÂ to a word and hand it to the public.
        So, while investors still welcome the sex appeal of a story that
        could be the next eBay, logical investorÂs are also finding
        enthusiasm for companies with balance sheets that confirm their
        business plans. We believe weÂve found a company with just that
        sort of promise.
        The Neptune Society (OTC: BB: NTUN) is a company entrenched in an
        industry that many of us never realized was quite so profitable,
        though ultimately, all of us will eventually need.
        What does this company do? Well, more than likely youÂve seen the
        ads on television. The Neptune Society provides cremation
        services in the death care industry; an industry that locks in
        profits on ÂPre-NeedÂ revenues, an industry on the cusp of the
        aging Baby Boomer generation.
        The Neptune Society is a company with a record of predictable,
        positive income results based on a $40 million trust, 55,000
        active contracts, and nearly 1,500 appointments scheduled for
        goods and services every month.
        According to Neptune chief operating officer (COO) David
        Schroeder, The Neptune Society has come a very long way. ÂAs a
        whole, we are very encouraged by our sales. Our revenues are up,
        our operating efficiency has improved, and we set a record in May
        for Pre-Need sales and cash collected. Another important factor
        in our success is in our market share. Across the industry, some
        companies have experienced up to a 12 percent drop in market
        share while our market share has increased two to five percent.
        Our unique management and marketing structure has been extremely
        effective in delivering results.Â
        Lou Fischler, a top analyst at Banyan Capital Markets, has
        written an in-depth research report his firm has issued to
        initiate coverage on The Neptune Society. He took time to talk to
        us this week. ÂThe company has a good story to tell. Management
        took a fragmented group of partnerships and unified them into one
        efficient, consolidated, public company. Taking over the
        operations and financially engineering them into one operating
        company is impressive. They can now start to focus on
        accelerating their marketing, producing growth, and implementing
        their business model.
        ÂThe companyÂs true operating adjusted cash-flow for the first
        quarter was approximately $500,000. Now with its operating
        structure firmly in place, it is positioned to concentrate more
        of its resources to drive Pre-Need sales and generate more and
        more cash flow. Because of NeptuneÂs revenue recognition policy
        and significant non-cash expenses, its reported financial results
        tend to understate its real operating performance. As a result,
        cash flow is more relevant in determining value than net earnings
        for this company. The management at the Neptune Society has
        jumped some very high hurdles and landed on its feet. The company
        is a major player in its industry and its year-over-year numbers
        are outstanding.Â
        Sound Interesting? Take a look at these bullet points:
        The Neptune Society offers new investors and current shareholders
        a fundamentally sound business model and four unique elements
        that are significant to growth.
        EXISTING ASSETS
        When the trust was established in 1988 its beginning marker was
        $0. In 1994 it had risen to $16 million and now, in 2001, the
        total pre-funded cremation arrangements exceed $40 million. With
        Neptune's continued expansion, estimates for the fund are $74
        million by 2004.
        SALES
        The trust supports a growing bottom line. Cremation costs 50-80%
        less than traditional burials and Pre-Need contracts at the
        Neptune Society have grown at an annual compound rate of 32.7%
        from 1998 to 2000 with a historical cancellation rate for
        Pre-Need services at less than one percent.
        REVENUES
        In addition to the companyÂs main channels of revenues, the
        Neptune Society also benefits from sales that include
        registration services like a travel rider that ranges from
        $50-300, and is immediately recognized as revenue and an 8%
        interest charge in California and Oregon on Pre-Need installment
        programs
        SOLID MANAGEMENT
        During the past two years, a talented group of four senior
        executives has been recruited to operate Neptune.  Collectively,
        these executives possess substantial functional expertise and
        over 100 years of combined experience in the cremation industry.
        Marco Markin became the first member of NeptuneÂ current
        management team when he became a member of NeptuneÂs Board of
        Directors in June 1999 and its President and Chief Executive
        Officer (CEO) in September 1999.
        David L. Schroeder was recruited to be NeptuneÂs Chief Operating
        Officer (COO) on June 1, 2000, and became a Director and its
        Secretary in November 2000.
        Rodney M. Bagley became a Director, the Chief Financial Officer
        and the Treasurer of Neptune in November 2000.
        Gary I. Harris became NeptuneÂs National Sales Manager and a
        Director in March 2000.
