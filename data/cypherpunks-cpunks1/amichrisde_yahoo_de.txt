@_subject: [mnet-devel] Grid Of Trust -- pre-design 
Hey guys who ever wants to take first peek at my baby DHT/premix idea please
take a peek and
crtitique it.  It's a bit rough around the edges and there's plenty of room
for modification, but
I'm pretty sure the ideas are sound.
The basic idea is to force data and nodes to be randomly distributed in a
grid.  This provides
resistance against serveral types of attacks.
Feel free to comment on or off list.

@_subject: [mnet-devel] Anonymity and Performance in Peer-to-Peer Systems 
This post is supposed to get to Nikita Borisov and Jason Waddle regarding:
Part 1:
"Research a formal metric for the anonymity of a system. We are currently
performing a literature
search; if we fail to find a suitable metric in past research, we will propose
a new one."
Here's a nice paper that analizes the annonymity of Crowds:
Probabilistic Analysis of Anonymity
Vitaly Shmatikov
SRI International
"We use discrete-time Markov chains to formally model the behavior of group
in Crowds [22], specify anonymity properties of the system as temporal logic
formulas, and use a
probabilistic model checker to verify them. This analysis method is applicable
to other
probabilistic systems such as Freenet."
Part 2:
DOS Resistance: I've got a basic handle now on DOS resistance vs. peformance
and I can almost get
a faint glimmer of what the a "perfect" DHT should look like.  I've posted my
ideas on it to the
Freenet list and I'll post them to the MNet list today too.
If anyone wants to discuss how to build a better Freenet, I'd LOVE to help.

@_subject: [mnet-devel] DOS in DHTs 
Ok as promissed, here's a bit of analysis on DOS in DHTs and trade offs with
performance.  Have a
nice read.
I'm going to discuss Denial of Service Attacks (DOS) from within P2P networks,
not the underlieing
network (TCP/IP), independently of what routing system is used.
The resistance R of a network to a DOS censure attack is the number of
nodes/resources an
adversary is forced to attack in order to make it hard to retrieve a
particular piece of data.
---- Really stupid routing (RSR)
Let's talk about the most resistant network style there is first, the old
Gnutella network.  Since
data can be anywhere, a adversary is pretty much forced to attack all the
nodes in the system.
R = O(N)
---- Global Hashes
Let's talk about some of the pretty academic DHTs, which provide nice
peformance by mapping each
key onto a specific target node via global hash.  Many of these systems have
the resistance of
only one or a fixed number of nodes.
R = O(1)
---- Intermediate networks
In between these two networks we have systems like Entropy which break thier
hashspace down into s
(s=16) specialized cells via a global hash, which then use simple RSR.
I'm going to do some analysis on this type of network, which should generally
be valid for DOS in
all DHTs.
s = specialization of the network
r = redundancy with which a piece of data is stored
d = search depth or number of specialized nodes asked
p = probablity that the data is found
N = total number of nodes
R = Resistance to a DNS attack
Since an adversary would not know which nodes in one of Entropy's cells had
the data, he would be
forced to attack all of them.
R = O(N/s)
This should be clear:
p = 1-(1-r*s/N)^d
At constant p we can evaluate design trade-offs at large N.
s*r*d = O(N)
or R = O(r*d)   regardless of N.
There is a three way geometric trade-off between redundancy of storage (insert
HTL*frequency, or
popularity), query depth (request HTL), and resistance to DOS.  This is what
I'm calling the holy
trinity of DOS in DHTs.  I believe it holds true for all DHTs using global
You could for example design a network where:
R = N^0.5
r = d
Thus making r and d O(N^0.25), which you might be able to live with.
Here are some sample parameters and p, to give you an idea of the trade-offs
in a million node
n	r	d	s	p
1000000	100	100	100	0.633967659
1000000	100	10	1000	0.65132156
1000000	10	100	1000	0.633967659
1000000	100	100	100	0.633967659
1000000	1000	10	100	0.65132156
1000000	1000	100	10	0.633967659
1000000	10	1000	100	0.632304575
1000000	100	1000	10	0.632304575
1000000	1	1000	1000	0.632304575
1000000	10	10	10000	0.65132156
1000000	1000	1	1000	1
1000000	100	20	1000	0.878423345
1000000	20	20	1000	0.332392028
---- Non-Global Hashing
I've got another neat trick to improve things a bit.  A trusted group of nodes
could use a private
hashing function to redistribute data between them.  As long as the adversary
can not infiltrate
the group, he is forced to flood the whole group.  A request or insert need
only travel one hop
through the group.
In networks where there is believed to be a certain fraction of adversarial
nodes f, you can
calculate the optimal clustering c to throw random nodes together in this
This local hashing cann't be used to get around the trinity, but just win a
considerable boost to
performance.  In each specialized cell you could have clusters of nodes,
instead of single ones.
I've got other ideas that involve key sharing to try to make clusters that can
scale higher, but
I'm not sure it's feasible/nessesary.
---- One more point
Replication (r) doesn't have to mean coping the data.  I could premix route to
r nodes and only
tell them I have the data.  I still will have done O(r) work though.  Think of
it this way.
 = O(  *  )
Likewise "depth" (d) for searches doesn't have to be HTL; you can search
several nodes in
parallel, but the system will still have used O(d) resources.
