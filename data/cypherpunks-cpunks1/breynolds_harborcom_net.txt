Oh, like "Life, Liberty, and molesting the convenient altar boy"
The country was founded on some conception of god which was melded
with the general beliefs of the founders.  But if you are referring
to the original government of the united states, then you are
referring to a goverment which largely dealt with foreign
relations are rarely trod into the realms of personal liberty.
In fact, it was the liberty which england had violated that
all this crazy stuff started over.  Though the founders
of our nation were protestant or whatnot, they still realized the
importance of not letting their personal beliefs meddle with the
running of a government.  That is a very poor argument.  I guess hitler's plan was pretty
good to ensure an aryan nation because it was the best thing
available at the time?.   Ok, here is the plan.  Anarchy.  when this happens, I am getting
my handy spoon and killing nameless members of the anti-cypherpunks
regime.  Heh, we can even have a little wagering pool on it.
I have seen you do nothing but slam, belittle, and degrade
Blah, another believer that polysyllabic attack will somehow give credence to your argument.  Well, this obviously refined
message (not including the shut up at the end) is a good indicator
of just how fucked up this country is.  How about you go about
your business and I go about mine and we never meet unless you and
I agree to.  Look, I have to talk to way too many morons like yourself everyday
and I must admit that it gives me headaches.  So go be a good
cybersitter and monitor the gigs of porn piped into your house
every day and don't bother me with your tripe.

Yes, but you must first assert that this is a zero sum game. The semantics of such a philosophy are too much to think about now. :).

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed from available
data.  Our authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon
shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold,
as the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49)
times as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or fifty times in all.  The
light we receive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we
receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can
compute the temperature of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will
heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the
heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute temperature of the earth
(-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell cannot be
computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the temperature at which
brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.
Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have
their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of
molten brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the
boiling point, or 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a
lake.)  We have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.
