please somebody give them the info so that they take themselves out of our
misery, since obviously they will botch the job and will give us great
pleasure with all the fireworks.

Man has anybody noticed how many of these @ there seem to be, I
always wonder if they are as dumb as they seem to be or do the cops think we
are as dumb as they seem to be?
Not to say that this one is a cop playing robber but, really........  {:-()

no.... I don't think that is what is being asked here, read the message
again and you will see that he is asking for getting news not being news
(even though I would love it if aolers would become news in the worst way),
so I suggest that instead he should do this:
1.) go to his mailbox or PO box
2.) open up his computer
3.) carefully insert mail in any possible cavity (in computer stones for
4.) and now proceed with prior suggestion or
5.) ensure computer is plugged in (wall socket, you know... socket connected
to power grid, grid connected to generator... etc)
6.) pour water or other suitably conductive liquid on whole mess
7.) repeat all steps as often as necessary for enlightenment to be achieved
 This might not get the poster closer to knowledge as far as news is
concerned but it should definitely provide us with a chuckle or two.
