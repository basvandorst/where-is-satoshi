"Tentacles," indeed. You only exist on the net in terms of the persona (or

William H Payne originally discovered how to break RSA without factoring
by using powers of two on 10/15/90.
Mr Payne wrote a draft paper "Public Key Cryptography is Easy to
Break" on 10/16/90.  The abstract (draft only) appears below:
  Public key, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman,
  cryptography is broken without factoring the modulus m.
  The product of the encryption and the decryption exponent is
  computed directly with order log(base 2) m shifts, adds, and compares.
  A continued product between the modulus and its multiplier which
  matches a criterion solves the Fermat-Euler theorems simply for
  even very large moduli.
Mr Payne is writing a tutorial paper on the same subject with Jon
Grant which should propose a new public encryption algorithm as
a standard which can not be easily broken.
This indirectly relates to Ada in that projects in the process of
implementing public key encryption in Ada may find these advances
of value.
This information also calls into the question the validity of
patent claims for RSA.

@_subject: Get this (from alt.security.pgp)... 
When I began participating in cryto discussions here, there were several
issues of interest to me. One was to encourage RSADSI to permit a
"U.S.-legal" version of PGP. I have worked behind the scenes with RSA to
encourage that, and it now appears that with ViaCrypt that goal has been
reached for DOS, and one assumes soon for Unix and the Mac.
Another was to make it clear that I thought both that pgp 1.x and 2.x
were infringements of PKP's patents in the U.S. and those who encouraged
or supported that were acting in a counterproductive way to RSA's
permitting a licensed version. I've made my views very clear on this,
and now that ViaCrypt is out, the issue is somewhat stale.
A third was my concern that PGP2.x was the result of violating U.S. law.
Since a Grand Jury is now investigating this matter, I am happy to leave
it, whatever the outcome, in the hands of the professionals.
I claim no personal credit for any of the above developments.
Along the way I electronically met many colleages who vigorously but
civilly disagreed with some of my views and advocacies. They have earned
my undying respect and admiration.
I also met some who were, not to put too fine a point on it, badly in
need of having their mouths washed out with soap. They will remain in
memory for who they have shown themselves to be.
My biggest single disappointment was with Mike Godwin and EFF. I had
considered them to be professionals working on issues I supported. I now
believe they are petty special pleaders riding a particular hobby horse,
and to some extent a toy of their major funders. They have, again in my
view, shown themselves not above both inaccurate propaganda statements,
and a complete inability to acknowledge and correct such errors when they
Thanks to the many who sent me e-mails of support during this whole
experience. Thanks also also to the few who had genuine disagreements
and expressed them civilly in e-mail.
Since the main issues of concern to me now seem to be well in train, it's
time to use my energies in other ways. Thus I am removing
talk.politics.crypto and alt.security.pgp from my reading lists. I am
always available via e-mail, and would welcome news from colleagues who
wish to take the trouble to write me on how Phil Zimmerman is doing, how
the Grand Jury proceedings are coming along and with what result, and
when "U.S.-legal" Mac and Unix versions of PGP become available.
For those who are curious, when I need encryption my current tools of
choice are TechMail for correspondence flowing via POP Mail servers, and
MacRipem for point-to-point traffic to other Macs. I am also
experimenting with the new Mac System 7 Pro and an illustrative
application Apple sent to developers that handles internet mail within
it. I understand Ripem Mac will fit into this model and accept the
System 7 Pro signer keys for encryption, and I'm going to work with that
as well.

@_subject: Secure Phone Progress (fwd) 
Over in the comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard group there have been a couple of
brief mentions of the new "Windsurfer" card from IBM. It apparently
incorporates a couple of DSP chips, a 14.4K modem, a soundblaster emulator,
general midi, kitchen sink, etc :-).
I don't know if these DSP chips will be user programmable or not, but if so,
this sounds like the one board you need to build your very own secure
phone. The 14.4K modem for sending the data, the DSP chips for audio
compression, and the sound board for digitizing speach and playing it
back. Throw in a little private key exchange via RSA or equivalent at the
start of the connection, and use triple DES or IDEA on the data (of course,
the person at the other end needs the same setup).
Does anyone have any more details on this board (like, will it be user
programmable, and will the specs be available for less than your firstborn
child :-)?

@_subject: New Keyserver 
Hello Internet,
a new PGP public key server has been setup; this time in the Netherlands.
It is a mail-only server, no anon-ftp. The address of the server is
pgp-public-keys at kub.nl
the service is already synchronized with the other international keyservers,
although I will ask more servers to directly sync with me in the near future.
The system running the service is directly connected to Tilburg University's
FDDI ring, which is one 2 Mbps hop away from Delft, which is one 34 Mbps hop
away from Amsterdam, which will soon have its Europanet/EMPB/Dante fatpipe
to the USA. It should be well connected...
For the time being, the server starts up every 15 minutes.
