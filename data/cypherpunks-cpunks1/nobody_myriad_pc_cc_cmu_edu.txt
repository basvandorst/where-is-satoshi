protect themselves against tyranny in government.

What if it was possible to specify an alternate remailer?  In the case that
a remailer went down, you could specify an alternate.  For example:
Anon-To: remailer at foo.com
Alternate-To: remailer at bar.com
Encrypted: PGP
---pgp msg---
If foo.com was down, the message would be delivered to bar.com instead.
The PGP message would have to be readable to both of them, so it would
decrease security, but reliability would be better, especially for
reply blocks.  Comments?

By attempting a connection to the SMTP port and using the alternate if
it fails?
