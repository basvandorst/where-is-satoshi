To make their denial credible, they could give the owner access to the
private key of the TPM/SCP.  But somehow I don't think that jibes with
their agenda.
If I buy a lock I expect that by demonstrating ownership I can get a
replacement key or have a locksmith legally open it.

Although I support the vote-with-your-wallet paradigm, this analysis
seems overly simplistic to me.  Macrovision doesn't solve problems for
most VCR purchasers, but they pay for it anyway.  They have no choice.
In some cases people are required to buy and use something that they
might not otherwise be inclined to pay for, e.g., catalytic converters
in automobiles (which also use palladium).  It doesn't seem reasonable
to similarly require TCPA in computers, but legislators might think
(or be lobbied) otherwise.
If the fears that some people have expressed prove justified and TCPA
becomes primarily a means to enforce draconian copyright restrictions,
then people may well choose to pay for it just to regain pre-TCPA
functionality.  In that case, the problems it solves for them are the
same ones it causes!

The model and the goal are a bit different, but how about secure
multi-party computation, as introduced by Chaum, Crepeau, and Damgard
in 1988 and subsequently refined by others?

Sorry, I see from an earlier message of yours that you are looking for
a simple non-crypto solution, so I guess this doesn't fit the bill.
The examples you gave in your earlier message all seem to be
equivalent to having the participants send the data to a trusted third
party who performs the computation, except that the trusted third
party is transplanted to one or more of the participants computers,
which are protected against their owners.  I guess it boils down to
whether or not the level of trust is sufficient.  This seems iffy when
one of the participants is also the trust provider.

But feel free to make
  whatever assumptions you like about my motives.  All I ask is that you
  respond to my facts.
I, for one, support your efforts, even though I don't agree with some
of your conclusions.  It is clear that you hold a firm opinion that
differs from what many others here believe, so in making your points
you can expect objections to be raised.  You will be more convincing
(at least to me) if you continue to respond to these dispassionately
on the basis of facts and reasoned opinions (your "normal style"?).
Calling Lucky a liar is no more illuminating than others calling you
an idiot.

A trivial observation: this cannot be true across hardware platforms.
TCPA claims to be "platform and OS agnostic", but Palladium does not.

I took a look at the archives as you suggested.  If it matters to you,
I wasn't referring to your classification of Anonymous as an idiot
(which I hadn't seen because it wasn't sent to the cryptography list),
but rather to an earlier comment ("Wow.  You must really be an
idiot.") from somebody else.  Looking back at that message, it appears
that it was sent to the cryptography list but not to cypherpunks.
Discussion about TCPA/Pd continues, and I hope that disagreements
needn't degenerate into name-calling.

What you can have is for the voter to be able to verify that his/her
vote was properly counted without being able to prove it to anybody
In that case, an individual claim that a vote was improperly counted
wouldn't be convincing, but a wide enough outcry might trigger a
I think this would add unnecessary and undesired complexity to a
political election voting system, though.

This is not strictly correct.  The payer can reveal the blinding
factor, making the payment traceable.  I believe Chaum deliberately
chose for one-way untraceability (untraceable by the payee but not by
the payer) in order to address concerns such as blackmailing,
extortion, etc.  The protocol can be modified to make it fully
untraceable, but that's not how it is designed.
Apart from the transferability issue, I think there are some systems
that do not rely on an issuer at all (in effect any payee is an
issuer).  Manasse's Millicent comes to mind, but I confess that I
don't fully remember the details.
