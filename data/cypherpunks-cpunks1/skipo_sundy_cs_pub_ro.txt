Mon Feb 10 15:58 EET 1997 Romania  "Buffer Overflow" rules.
I have found a buffer overflow hole in ffbconfig (Solaris2.X). That allow  you
to gain root access on your machine. I used an exploit written by Jeremy Elson
for gethostbyname() buffer overflow hole (I modified some values to make this work).   I dont now yet what in ffbconfig is wrong but Im still diging. So more detailes later.
Here's the exploit for Solaris 2.X:

@_subject: Security hole in Solaris 2.5 (sdtcm_convert) + exploit 
Sat Feb 22 15:25:48 EET 1997 Romania
Another hole in Solaris
I have found a security hole in sdtcm_convert on Solaris 2.5.1.
sdtcm_convert - calendar data conversion utility - allows any user to
change the owner for any file (or directory) from the system or gain root
access. The exploit is very simple. Change the permision mode of your calendar
file (callog.YOU) from /var/spool/calendar directory (usual r--rw----) and run
sdtcm_convert. sdtcm_convert 'll observe the change and 'll want  to
correct it (it 'll ask you first). You have only to delete the callog file
and make a symbolic link to a target file and your calendar file and said to
sdtcm_convert 'y' (yes). sdtcm_convert 'll make you the owner of target
file ...  A simple way to correct this is to get out suid_exec bit from
I made an exploit, so you have to extract the text, uudecode it, and exec
a 'tar -xf exploit.tar'. You'll get the files in exploit_dir.

Sun Feb 23 10:36:58 EET 1997 Romania
"Exploit for sdtcm_convert - Solaris 2.5"
I send you an e-mail about a bug and an exploit for sdtcm_convert.
(sdtcm_convert allows you to become owner of any file or directory from
the system - and gain root access )
First, there was some problems with my uuencoded exploit (some damaged it
on the route...) so i'll resend you the files for exploit.
Second, Casper Dick send me:
I cant found this patches to verify if that fix the problem i have
found or not. Anyway you have an exploit ! (execute 'thefist' and wait)

@_subject: Big Security Hole in Solaris 2.X (X)passwd + exploit 
Tue Feb 25 14:22 EET 1997 Romania
 " Another letter - another bug "
An Exploit for a Big Big security hole in passwd ( + yppasswd and nispasswd)
Under Solaris 2.X passwd, yppasswd and nispasswd can be overflowed in an internal function ( some like sa_chauthtok() ). Using a buffer overflow exploit anyone can gain root access (passwd need suid exec bit from root). passwd has a second  overflow bug  when it is called with '-s' option in an internal strcpy().
I written two exploits one for Solaris 2.4 and one for Solaris 2.5 for sa_chauthtok() type function ( passwd LEMON_BUFFER ). It's a little trick here - the LEMON_BUFFER is shifted in memory with 1 char after exec so it must to shift the LEMON_BUFFER in a reverse direction before exec - that's happening only for a special combination of the exec args - see my exploits.
A way to prevent the exploit is to rename passwd, nispasswd and yppasswd and get out suid-exec bit. After that you have to compile a little program ( some like newpass.c ) with name passwd or nispasswd or yppasswd  like root and  give them suid-exec bit. You have to change the  "hidden_passwd" constant with the new name of Xpasswd files.

@_subject: Exploit for buffer overflow in /bin/eject - Solaris 2.X 
motto: "Mihai Eminescu was a good friend of Ion Creanga"
Thu  Mar 13 21:01:00 EET 1997  - Romania
"Hole in /bin/eject - buffer overflow"
I exploited the buffer overflow hole in /bin/eject on Solaris 2.X (who
have suid exec bit and is owned by root). The buffer overflow problem
appears in an internal function media_find(). The result is: any user can gain root shell. So, to prevent /bin/eject exploit, you have to get out suid-exec bit from /bin/eject (that's very simple) and compile a little program like:
 main()
 {execl("/bin/eject","eject","floppy",(char *)0);}
That allows your work station ordinary users to eject floppy (thats the main task for eject).
I wrote two exploits (Solaris 2.4 & 2.5.1). My exploit for Solaris 2.4 looks a bit ugly - the buffer is two short - but it works.
For both exploits argv[1] can change the STACK_OFFSET value (for troubleshotings +- 8 .. +-64 .. the step is 8).
The interesting thing about this exploit it worked on some machines where it was installed some stuff to make inofensiv buffer overflows exploits ... Ok you have right down two exploits.
For future I'm planing a web page with security stuff for Solaris so try Cristian Schipor - Computer Science Faculty - Bucharest - Romania
