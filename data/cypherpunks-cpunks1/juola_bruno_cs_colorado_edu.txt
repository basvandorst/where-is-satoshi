  Short of actual references, this remains an urban legend. Even if

  application of doubling and similar strategies.
Even if someone could come up with references, that *still* doesn't mean
much, since it's a probabilistic argument.  Like buying lottery tickets

Should be no trouble at all; I would do it myself except that I'm trying
to write a dissertation.  In the interest of "fairness," I suggest the
following (without looking at the numbers).
various sorts of futures.  I suggest someone simply check the closing
prices of a half dozen futures (gold, silver, oil, wheat, corn, and pick
two at your convenience) on the 1st of January, 1993.  Flip a coin for
whether person A or person B does the buying of $10,000 worth of futures,
then recheck the price on 1 Feb.  If B makes $500 or more, assume the
laundering has worked -- if not, double the investment and recheck on
1 Mar.  If the Martingale scheme works, at least 5 out of the 6 should
have successfully transferred the money by 1 Dec....

@_subject: Remailer Musings 
I disagree with Brad's interpretation.  For example, if I photocopy a   book and anonymously snail mail it to people, do you think the postal   service is going to take the fall?  Nope - they are just a carrier, and   are not responsible for content.  Like the common carriers - they just   receive a message and pass it along.  They aren't responsible for message   content.  If Brad Templeton's view of the world was the prevailing (or   correct) one, then every common carrier in the country, including Ma Bell   and the US Postal Service, would not exist, because they would've been   sued out of existence long ago.
On the other hand, part of the rules of being a common carrier are that
one is *required* to cooperate with appropriate authorities to prevent
this sort of abuse and to catch said abusers if/when it happens.  I
suspect that Mr. Templeton's lawyer could make a case that by setting
up a remailer where one cannot "trace calls," one is violating the
requirements of being a common carrier, and thus is responsible for

@_subject: Remailer Musings 
Ed Carp sez :
  I understand your objections, but think about it this way: nothing in the   world says that you have to put a return address on the envelope.    Nothing in the world says that you have to present any form of ID in   order to drop a letter into a postal box.  Sure, the postal inspectors   have to "cooperate", but if you drop a letter with no return address into   a box, how could they trace it back to you?  Are people going to say to   the US postal folks, "hey, it's *your* fault that they didn't put a   return address on their envelope!"  I think not.
Yes, but that's not what anonymous remailers *do*.  Anonymous remailers
accept mail that comes in an envelope *with a return address* and
repackage it in a different envelope without a return address.  So,
yes, in a way, it *is* the analogical Post Office's fault that the
letter arrived without a return address.
  Similarly, I think that anonymous remailers, like the post office, ma   bell, etc., are common carriers.  You can't have it both ways - either   you are a common carrier and exercise no editorial control over what goes   through your remailer, or you are a publisher, and are held to a certain   degree of legal responsibility.
But if one is a common carrier, one is required to assist.  The whole
remailer paradigm is designed to prevent such assistance.  Therefore,
by running a remailer, you are stating that you are *not* willing to
assist the appropriate authorities, i.e. that you are not a common
Or so a lawyer could claim.

@_subject: Remailer Musings 
Does anyone have a cite to support the notion that common carriers are
  obligated to assist in the identification of users of their services? I got it at the January '94 USENIX tutorial on Internet and the Law.
Given that it's still being taught, it should be no problem for anyone
with interest to confirm that.    I received annoying phone calls for a period of time, and the local phone
  company (US West) said they'd only get involved once I had an "incident   number" (or some such) from the police department, and that information
  gathered would only be released to the police. I suppose if I actually
  filed a civil suit against the harassing party (even as a John Doe?) I
  could then use the discovery process to compel them to release their
  relevant records - but that's not really the scenario that Brad and
  'kitten' seem to imagine.
Um, speaking for myself and not Brad, that's exactly the situation where
this sort of thing would be problematic.  Copyright infringement is a
criminal offence as well as a civil tort.  So if Brad (or the newswire)
wanted to push it, they could try to haul the remailer operator into
court.  And if he claimed to be a "common carrier," he's supposed to help.
If he's unable (read, unwilling by design) to help, then it's possible
that a judge could find that he's not a common carrier and therefore liable.
Of course, I'm not a lawyer myself.  And the law, in its infinite majesty,
can do strange things.  I personally believe that remailer operators
should be considered to be common carriers, but that's a very tricky
proposition to justify in a court.

  That'll happen with the book'o'barcodes too, and you can't
  use an anonymous remailer for that.
I believe that's the question under discussion -- whether or not
a book'o'barcodes would pass under the ITAR regulations.  Given
that the book itself passes (has already passed), what changes
would need to be made so that the book could still be exported but
be much easier to enter into a machine than having to retype the
whole thing.

Nobody asks :
  re cripple; i was told that if law enforcement cannot determine which key
  will unlock the message prior to the message actually being sent over the   net, the message will not be decodable is there any truth to this? I don't think so.  I can certainly download a message onto my disk and
decypher it at my leisure, by brute force if necessary.

Actually, we might try inviting such prosecution -- e.g., with each of us
  posting source code for some algorithm to the list.  This is so clearly
  publication (ala newsletters on paper) that the case would never hold but
  it wouldn't hurt to have a court rule.
I wish I had your faith in the court system -- or perhaps I'm glad I
don't.  Either way, the fact that you and I and everyone on cypherpunks
thinks that posting code to a private mailing list is "publication"
means exactly nothing in court, any more than it would be if I made
a huge conference call to everyone on cypherpunks to conspire to evade
the ITAR regulations.

That is correct.  As a matter of fact, it's an easy theorem that
an NFA has the same computing capacity as a DFA; it is not known
whether this theorem holds for more powerful machines, and is in
fact the heart of the P ?= NP conjecture.
