Do y�all think there might be an interest in a
utility which would allow the user to deal with
browser cookies?
What I imagine is a little utility that would
display the cookies stashed on a machine and
give the user the option to either delete or
 edit  any given cookie.
(Hey, it�s *your* computer, not the website�s).
This little app would also come with help text
explaining what a cookie is (and is not).  In
future it might run in the background and alert
the user when a cookie is being dropped and the
user could give or deny permission (Netscape 3.0
will do this as well).
As it is an �anti-virus� type product it would
be offered for free.  I could just stick it up
on Apple�s (or Netscape's) website when finished.
Do any such utilities currently exits?

I agree.  Editing is problematic.
It would be difficult to decode intentionally
hidden information.  The user may suspect strange and not
obvious stuff in a site's given cookie.  Then what may
happen is the user will "vote with their mouse" and stop
using a site that encripts cookie data (or perhaps not).
In any case the user will at least have the knowledge
that the cookie exists.  Those that do not encrypt may
provide other interesting information.
