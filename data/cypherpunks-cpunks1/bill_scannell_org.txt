Russian officials reject tourist
MOSCOW (AP) -- Officials rejected a South African Internet tycoon's bid to
fly to the International Space Station because he made unreasonable demands,
Russian news agencies reported Friday.
Mark Shuttleworth, 27, underwent a month of tests and preparation at the
Star City cosmonaut training center outside Moscow over the summer. But the
Cape Town native failed to conclude a contract to become the second tourist
in space. California tycoon Dennis Tito, who reportedly paid $20 million to Russia's
cash-strapped space agency, made an eight-day trip to the station last
spring. "All attempts to bring Shuttleworth's conditions into correspondence with
regular practice have been abortive," the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Russian Space Agency director Yuri Koptev as saying.
Koptev said that Shuttleworth had insisted on a minimum of two weeks in
space, instead of the eight to 10 days the space agency favored.
"This demand would throw off the flight schedule," Koptev said.
Koptev said that Shuttleworth had also expected a free second flight to
space if the first spacecraft failed to dock with the station, ITAR-Tass
reported.

In a recent post to the cypherpunks mailing list, I implied that you were a
borderline retarded, imbecilic loser with absolutely nothing of any interest
to say.
I was wrong.
What I meant to say was that I believe you to be a sad, pathetic teenager of
limited intelligence who has never quite recovered from the wedgies meted
out by your betters.  That you eschew the name your parents gave you in
favor of the nom de perdant 'mattd' ( (door)matt?) proves well the point.
If you somehow manage to gain employment despite the economic downturn and
your limited qualifications, you might find your self-respect improved to
the point where you can contribute in a positive way to society.
You can't live off federal welfare assistance forever.  The quick service
restaurant industry might well be a field where you can gain the discipline
you'll need before approaching cypherpunk list members for a position as an
entry-level assistant.
Feel free to threaten to have me killed.  I haven't had a death threat in

@_subject: What You Can Do -Right Now- To Stop CAPPS II  
Dear Patriot,
For the past seven months, I have been fighting for the right of all
Americans to travel freely in our own country.  CAPPS II, the Soviet-style
internal border control system being pushed by the Department of Homeland
Security, will strip us of that right, and make air travel a 'privilege'
granted by government.
A lot has been accomplished:
* Delta was shamed out of testing CAPPS II
* Homeland Security was forced to appoint a Chief Privacy Officer
* JetBlue was exposed violating the privacy of millions of passengers
* JetBlue was shamed out of CAPPS II testing
* A pro-CAPPS II 'consumer advocate' was unmasked as a Cendant shill
* Galileo/Cendant has backpedaled on CAPPS II
I need your help taking this fight forward.
Running the anti-CAPPS II campaign costs a lot of time and money.  The
Boycott Delta and Don't Spy On US websites require a team of graphic artists
and web designers.  As you can imagine, the bandwidth usage is enormous.
The over 40 million dollars in publicity generated for the ongoing
anti-CAPPS II awareness campaign came at a cost of hundreds of media
interviews, astronomical telephone bills, and all of my time and energy.
Up to now, I have funded this project out of my own personal savings.
America has been good to me and spending money to keep our country free
seemed only fair.  Unfortunately, I can't do this alone anymore, which is
why I am turning to you for help.
To keep up the fight, I need you to contribute to the cause.  Whether you
can afford $20.00 or $100.00; $50.00 or $1,000.00 , every cent you give
makes it possible to keep up the pressure on those who would make our great
nation less free.
There are two ways you can help fund the fight:
1. Use your credit card and contribute using PayPal:
           2.  Send a check or money order payable to 'Bill Scannell' in care of my
        The Electronic Frontier Foundation
        454 Shotwell Street
        San Francisco, CA 94110
Together, we can stop CAPPS II.
With deepest gratitude,
Bill Scannell

@_subject: David Stempler:  TSA's Fake Passenger Advocate?  
At a press conference held on the 26th of September 2003, TSA chief James
Loy needed someone to extol the virtues of the CAPPS II internal border
control system.  His choice: 'passenger advocate' David S. Stempler , head
of the Air Travelers Association.  Stempler obliged, saying that CAPPS II
testing was a fine idea and that "(w)hatever's going to be done will have to
be done in secret".
If Stempler sounds like a boot-licking toady, it's because he probably is:
his association appears to be little more than a front for the Cendant
Corporation, whose Galileo subsidiary stands to gain a new profit center if
CAPPS II is implemented.

Spying Leak
Lest we forget what this is about: George W. Bush illegally ordered
NSA to
spy on US citizens.  This is a felony, for which I (and many other
and current NSA employees) hope to see him impeached and jailed.
As as former SIGINT analyst, I -and anyone else ever associated with
know that USSID 18 prohibits the spying on United States Persons.
This is
NSA's Prime Directive, Ten Commandments, and Bill of Rights, all
rolled into
one.  It is an unlawful order to direct NSA to eavesdrop on US
citizens. It
is impossible for me to stress strongly enough that from day one, every
human associated with NSA has USSID 18 drilled into him.
With USSID 18, NSA is able to protect and defend our country.
Without USSID
18, NSA can be used to oppress the American populace. It comes as no
surprise to me that, in the face of an unlawful order, someone went
to the
papers with the story.
The exception to the rule of course, is the FISA courts.  President Bush
declined to use these courts despite the ability to get a FISA
warrant three
days after the fact.
It is a shame that with such a massive crime freely admitted by
Bush, a smart guy like Hiawatha continues to carry water for this
