But the goal isn't to ban it; just marginalize it enough to be able to tar
it as a terrorist action.
True, there is no worldwide ban on finance.  But there is the delightful
'know your customer' law.

B*llshit. From a transcript of an interview of Al Gore by Wolf Blitzer:
" During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in

run for president, he's got to deal with his record, just like kerry (did I
