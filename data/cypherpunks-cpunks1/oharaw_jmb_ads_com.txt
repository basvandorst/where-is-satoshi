@_subject: Any suggestions on what to do with this junk? 
Hi, I'm new to this list so pardon my ignorance/naivete
I'm a systems admin type who is upgrading a bunch of desktop computers next month.  As a consequence, about half a dozen computers of the XT vintage will fall under my wing with instructions to "find something useful to do with them."  Are there any good suggestions out there about what I could do with old 8-bit technology vis-a-vis crypto?
