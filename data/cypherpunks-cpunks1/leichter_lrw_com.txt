@_subject: Attacking a secure smartcard 
I've previously mentioned Flylogic as a company that does cool attacks  on chip-level hardware protection.  In  , they talk about attacking the ST16601 Smartcard - described by the  vendor as offering "Very high security features including EEPROM flash  erase (bulk-erase)".  The chip is covered by a metal mesh that, if cut  or shorted, blocks operation.  However, Flylogic reports:
"Using our techniques we call, bmagicb (okay, itbs not magic but webre  not telling), we opened the bus and probed it keeping the chip alive.   We didnbt use any kind of expensive SEM or FIB.  The equipment used  was available back in the 90bs to the average hacker!  We didnbt even  need a university lab.  Everything we used was commonly available for  under $100.00 USD.
This is pretty scary when you think that they are certifying these  devices under all kinds of certifications around the world."

@_subject: cleversafe says: 3 Reasons Why Encryption is Overrated 
Since people do keep bringing up Moore's Law in an attempt to justify  larger keys our systems "stronger than cryptography," it's worth  keeping in mind that we are approaching fairly deep physical limits.   I wrote about this on this list quite a while back.  If current  physical theories are even approximately correct, there are limits to  how many "bit flips" (which would encompass all possible binary  operations) can occur in a fixed volume of space-time.  You can turn  this into a limit based solely on time through the finite speed of  light:  A computation that starts at some point and runs for n years  can't involve a volume of space more than n light years in radius.   (This is grossly optimistic - if you want the results to come back to  the point where you entered the problem, the limit is n/2 light years,  which has 1/8 the spacial volume).  I made a very approximate guess at  how many bit-flips you could get in a time-space volume of a 100 light- year sphere; the answer came out somewhere between 2^128 and 2^256,  though much closer to the former.  So physical limits prevent you from  doing a brute force scan - in fact, you can't even enumerate all  possible keys - in 100 years for key lengths somewhere not much more  than 128 bits.
It's rather remarkable that such fundamental limits on computation  exist at all, but physics over the last 100 years - and especially  over the last couple of decades - has increasingly shown us that the  world is neither continuous nor infinite; it has solid finite limits  on almost everything.  Even more remarkable is that we've pretty much  reached some of those limits.  For any recently designed cryptosystem,  brute force is simply out of the question, and will remains so forever  (unless we are very much mistaken about physics).  Moore's Law as a  justification for using "something more" makes no sense.
As you point out, the story for advances in cryptographic theory is  much more complex and impossible to predict.  That cryptographic  advances would render the "safer" AES-256 at risk while AES-128  remains secure (for now) is something no one could have predicted,  though in retrospect some of the concerns about the key scheduling may  have been right.  All the protocols and standards out there calling  for AES-256 - it's obviously "better" than AES-128 because after all  256 is *twice as large* as 128! - were just a bunch of nonsense.  And,  perhaps, dangerous nonsense.

@_subject: brute force physics Was: cleversafe... 
When the first results about exponential speedup of factoring came  out, people assumed that this was true in general.  But it isn't.  In  particular, simple search, where you have only an equality test so you  can't build a hash table or some kind of ordered structure - is O(N)  on a traditional computer - and O(sqrt(N)) on a quantum computer.  I'm  not sure what the current knowledge about what a quantum machine can  do for NP computations, but there's no "probably" here.
The physical arguments to which I was referring say *nothing* about  how the computation is done.  It can be a QM computation as well.
In any case, the simple search result above applies directly to brute  force:  For that problem, you only get a polynomial speedup anyway.
That's a ... bizarre point of view.  :-)  Should freedom from related- key attacks be part of the definition of a "secure" encryption  algorithm?  We should decide that on some rational basis, not on  whether, with care, we can avoid such attacks.  Clearly, a system that  *is* secure against such attacks is more robust.  Do we know how to  build such a thing?  What's the cost of doing so?  But to say it's an  *advantage* to have a weakness seems like some kind of odd moral  argument:  If you're hurt by this it's because you *deserve* to be.

@_subject: Ultimate limits to computation 
It must be the summer weather or something.  I've received a whole  bunch of messages - mainly privately - that say either "Here's another  result that has a higher upper bound on computation" or "Here's a  design for a machine that exceeds your bound".  Both ignore (a) how  bounds work:  That fact that you have a weaker bound doesn't mean I  don't have a stronger one; (b) that impossibility results can exist in  physics, not just in mathematics.  True, the nature of such results  are a bit different, since all our current physical theories might  turn out to be wrong.  But, hey, maybe our understanding of  computation or even mathematics has some fundamental flaw, too.
The estimate on the limits to brute-force search are mine, based on a  *very* rough estimate that draws on the results in the following  paper:  (I haven't actually read the paper; my analysis was based on an  article I can't find that discussed the implications of this one.)
The basic summary of the author's result is:  "[T]he total number of  bits and number of operations for the universe does not exceed  O(10^123)."  I guessed about how this value scales (as the cube of the  time - one factor for time, two for the size of the light sphere you  can reach in that time; not 3 because the information content of space  goes up as the area, *not* the volume - a very weird but by now  standard result).
Now, my scaling technique may be completely flawed, or my computations  may be wrong.  Or the paper could be wrong.  (I wouldn't bet on it.)   Or the physics may be wrong.  (I *really* wouldn't bet on that.)  But  the fact that there are other bounds around that are not as tight, or  that one can describe a machine that would do better if there were a  way to realize it, aren't evidence for any of these.  Bounds can be  improved, and a description isn't a working machine.
In fact, the whole point of the article that I *did* read is that this  result should make use re-examine the whole notion of a "possible"  computation.  It's easy to describe a computation that would take more  than 10^123 steps.  Ackerman's function exceeds that for pretty small  input values.  We've traditionally said that a computation is  "possible" if we can describe it fully.  But if it couldn't be  realized by the entire universe - is that really a *useful* notion of                                                          -- Jerry

Modern mobile phones possess three types of capabilities:
computing, communication, and sensing. While these capa-
bilities enable a variety of novel applications, they also raise
serious privacy concerns. We explore the vulnerability where
attackers snoop on users by sniffing on their mobile phone
sensors, such as the microphone, camera, and GPS receiver.
We show that current mobile phone platforms inadequately
protect their users from this threat. To provide better pri-
vacy for mobile phone users, we analyze desirable uses of
these sensors and discuss the properties of good privacy pro-
tection solutions. Then, we propose a general framework for
such solutions and discuss various possible approaches to
implement the frameworkbs components.
They have some suggestions, but feel the problems are deep and  probably not completely solvable.

Remember:  Before it's actually happened, any discussion is just  reckless speculation, rumor-mongering, or worse.
After it's actually happened, it's either (a) not a real issue; (b) a  major new attack that could not have been foreseen but that will be  dealt with immediately by top people.  Top people.

@_subject: New Research Suggests That Governments May Fake SSL Certificates 
While the paper provides a nice analysis and description of the  situation, what surprises me most about it is ... that anyone was  surprised.  Hardware to support man-in-the-middle splicing of HTTPS  sessions has been available in the marketplace for several years.   They are sold by companies like Bluecoat who build appliances to  monitor incoming and outgoing traffic at the interconnection points  between corporate networks and the greater Internet.  They're sold as  means to monitor and control what sites can be accessed (they block  things like gambling sites, pornography - whatever the corporation  doesn't want its employees browsing from work) and also inspect the  data for auditing/information leakage control purposes.
In the corporate environment, where desktops/laptops are managed, the  way such a device is given the ability to do MitM attacks is  straightforward:  The corporation simply pushes a new root CA - for a  CA that actually lives inside the intercept device - into the  browser's pool.  The device can then generate and sign any certs it  needs to to wedge into any HTTPS session invisibly.  Even when the  corporation allows personal machines onto the network, it will often  require users to accept a corporate CA for access to internal sites.   Of course, since browsers only have one pool of CA's, once you've  accepted that CA, you've accepted invisible MitM attacks by the  monitoring device.
Since the techniques and hardware for doing this has been around for a  while, it should come as no surprise that someone would notice that  governments are another good market - in fact, one that tends to be  fairly price-insensitive.  It's distressing how much government  intrusion technology is basically relabeled corporate security/ compliance technology.
Governments may or may not be in a position to force CA's onto a  machine, so it would be natural for them to compel existing CA's, as  the paper rightly points out.
