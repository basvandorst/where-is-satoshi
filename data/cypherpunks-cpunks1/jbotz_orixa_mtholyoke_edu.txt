No.  For a couple of good arguments for this answer read the
``Mathematical Recreations'' column in the latest SciAm.  (Or maybe it was last month's).

@_subject: EFF Analysis of Vice-President Gore's Letter on Cryptography Policy 
The EFF appears to have decided to declare victory... they say they
have "won" the opportunity to shape a better policy.  But almost
nobody else who is on the side of privacy feels the same way.  Even
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has officially stated that:
        I have read the July 20th letter from the Vice President about
   the Administration's current thinking on Clipper Chip and, to my
   mind, it represents no change in policy.  In fact, when this letter
   was sent, I would be surprised if the Administration even thought it
   was news.
Is the EFF growing seriously out of touch that an ordinary Senator's
assesment is so obviously more realistic?

I'm a bit behind, so sorry if others have already suggested this, but
you should need any digicash for this... stamps can be just big random
numbers.  Someone buys a books of stamps, you make 10 big random
numbers send them a copy and keep a copy on file.  After a message
comes through with a particular number you throw that number out.
Just like real stamps, and unlike money, they can be used only once.
