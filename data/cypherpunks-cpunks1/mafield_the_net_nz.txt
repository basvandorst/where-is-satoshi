@_subject: A weak defense against keyboard logging... 
After reading your email on cryptome.org....
A couple of weak defences against keyboard logging of passwords. Both
are useful to allow you to keep your password hidden from a keyboard
sniffer or a 'patched' telnet program.
'One key' password entry.
You could use your mouse to hunt and peck the desired letters on a
keyboard. Once a letter is chosen the cursor should jump to a random
location on the display to foil 'mouse sniffing'
