Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act apply only to federal agencies.
Privacy Act
Requests for personal data must be notarized.
If the agency ignores the request, you must appeal under FOIA, since
there are no appeal provisions under the Privacy Act.
You must specify the "Systems of Records" you want searched. These are
listed in the Federal Register and in "Protecting Your Right to Privacy--A Digest of Systems of Records, which you can get from the GPO). I've included the ones you probably would want with the FBI or CIA.
You must pre-authorize a dollar amount for search and copying costs.
Attached are some sample letters for the FBI, the CIA and general Privacy Act/FOIA.
FOIA requests can be more general, I've got info on that as well.
I am not a lawyer, and this is not intended as legal advice. The info
is out of a wonderful book:
It is a bit out of date (1985), but I believe the Privacy Act and FOIA
is still pretty much the same. It has extensive instructions for what
to actually do and what the pitfalls are.

Bad assumption. Written documents, even if written by you and even
if it incriminates you, can be subpoenaed. I forget the case that
set the precedent for this, but it had to do with someone's diary.

I believe the burden would actually be on them to crack the message
entirely. Otherwise, you are applying arbitrary algorithms to what may
be a random stream. If you get something comprehensible out, you have
either partially cracked the message, or run into the British Museum
problem (AKA 100 monkeys with typewriters).
