@_subject: camels and bananas, for some reason. 
I had to solve this problem before, don't remember specifics (of the whole process that is), but to get the bananas across, you couldn't just carry
them straight through, you had to drop some off, i.e. carry 1000 bananas,
walk 333 miles (eating 333 bananas), drop off 334, walk back (finishing off
the remaining ones), then when you got to that point again, (the 333 mark)
you would have 1000 again... the answer was 533+(1/3) iirc
