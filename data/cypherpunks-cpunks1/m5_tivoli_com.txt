Note that you could do it by e-mail too, if your targets read e-mail

There are such things as global optimizers that are quite capable of

No, it's not true that it "must" do that.  There are optimizer systems
that defer decisions until link time (the MIPS compilers for example).
That said, it's probably the case that a hand-written DES routine
could probably better a good optimizer; the size of the problem is
pretty small.  On the other hand, I suspect a specially-tuned optimizer that used (maybe; I'm making this up off the top of my

than a human coder would.

I see complaints about cookies all the time, and I just have to
wonder why the fuss seems so relatively, well, unsophisticated,
for lack of a better word.
The cookie idea, in and of itself, is really a pretty good one and
can provide some useful features.  Things like auto-configuring
web sites ("my Yahoo", though I don't know for sure how that works)
can exploit the cookie capability to provide convenience.  I just
can't get worked up over it.  The cookie issuer still doesn't really
know who the visitor is, of course, unless the visitor explicitly
hands over that information.
"Naughty" uses of cookies for tracking sites visited might be
objectionable, I suppose.  It's easy enough to do selective
editing of the cookie file of course (maybe this NSClean product
can do that).
One of the scary things might be that though cookies can be made
hard to forge, it's clearly impossible for cookie issuers to ensure the cookies aren't stolen or deliberately distributed.  If
a site uses a "secure" cookie as a means of identifying the web
visitor, there's certainly some risk if it then allows access to
sensitive information.

Maybe I should have been more clear.
It's certainly true that one could concoct software that looked for
some tell-tale signs in Java applets or ActiveX controls (though it'd
be a little tricker in the latter case, I suspect).  What worries me
is that this sort of tool might provide a false sense of security to
corporate IS types (people who pay my company lots of money).
(Oh, gee, I see now that the last line of your message was "It could
lead to a false sense of security."  Rare concensus on cypherpunks.)
Anyway, there are lots of products like this (lots of virus scanners
claim to defend against "all current and future viruses"), and they're
not quite the same as sleazy snake-oil pseudo-crypto outfits.  It
worries me, if only as somebody with money in a bank that might be
rendered vulnerable, that a tool like this might be installed under
the illusion that an impenetrable wall has gone up around the Seems to me that putting together an ActiveX control that "sneaks" its
way through the firewall risk policy wouldn't be hard.  Unless the applet scanner actually simulates execution of the control under a
variety of input conditions (and we know that's not likely) (but prove
me wrong, please) there's not much it can do other than poke around and
check what other DLL's the thing wants to access.  It might be a bit
harder to be sneaky in Java, but I certainly wouldn't bet I could look
at an applet and guarantee its safety to any threshold (if I could, why
not just do that in the browser?).
Believing in the safety of precertified applets/controls is scary enough.  Trusting yet another piece of software in the loop just seems
a little wacky to me.

IBM company, I'm not speaking for Tivoli.)

It doesn't matter *what* you do with your bits.  The key thing to
remember when analyzing your encryption method is that the foundation
of your security rests on the difficulty of reversing the numeric
sequence that drives the encryption.
If I know you're using this RNG-driven steganographic message mixer,
then if I can break your RNG I'm done.  If I know you're scrambling
bits in a file according to an RNG, if I break your RNG I'm done.
The key is therefore to make the RNG cryptographically secure.  Once
you've done that, then there's questionable value in doing anything
fancier than straight CBC (or something like that) to encrypt your
Note that simple functional composition of one or more simple insecure
RNG's does not necessarily give you a stronger RNG (in fact it usually
doesn't).  Cheap RNG's like what you get from the old UNIX "rand()"
are simple little linear functions, which when composed give you
more simple functions.

and homeschooled people.  If it's such a problem, where are all those
social freaks who got that way due to homeschooling?
Before the Industrial Revolution, homeschooling was of course quite
common.  Many "public schools" were simply cheap boarding houses for
lower-middle class children (see Nicholas Nickelby for a colorful
example).  Those with the means hired tutors.
Please note that homeschooling does not imply that parents isolate their
children from contact with the world until they're at voting age.  Also,
note that the public elementary schools I attended seemed hell-bent on
*preventing* any sort of interaction with a group of peers.  I don't

legislatures should be able to outlaw all the profanity and indecency
that they want.
Any of the cypherpunk.lawyers seen this?
Bork came across as kind-of a jerk, personality-wise.

And remember, you can do that simply by putting your applet in an
HTML document and then spam-mailing the document with appropriate MIME header information to zillions of people.  Everybody who's
reading mail with Netscape (and maybe IE) will see your little
HTML document (which needn't be anything special), and your applet
will be able to fire up and start stealing cycles.
In fact, it'd be cool to set up a mail sender that would construct
such a page automatically with each outgoing mail message.  That
way, ordinary postings to mailing lists would go out with that spiffy
HTML look, and you'd get all those CPU cycles without angering the
community (much).

Actually, I imagine Internet users will simply snigger and go on with
their idiotic "me too"s to USENET, their sophomoric nudie websites,
and their spams.
(I love the Internet.)

Has anyone who's registered for next week's conference at Rutgers
gotten any sort of confirmation?  I've been trying for days to do
so, and though I've sent mail and called I haven't managed to get
hold of anyone who can tell me anything.  (And now they seem to not
answer the phone at all; I think they got a bigger response than
they expected.)

Anybody know the frequencies used?
(Anybody willing to guess whether the FCC might quietly introduce
prohibitions against scanners that can receive those frequencies?)
(Gee, that looks paranoid.)
