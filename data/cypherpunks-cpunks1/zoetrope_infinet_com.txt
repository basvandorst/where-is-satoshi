For Finding a security bug in Netscape, is it true you only get a
measly shirt? if that is true why not just start a virus?

In response to Aleph ones message Nothing is totally secure....The
only security on the internet is being off-line....We can just make it
harder to hack but hackers evolve and adapt.......

Ya but a multi million dollar corp like netscape should be paying
big bucks for those bugs....Or the mob might...ya get my drift....Alot of
people give personalized T-shirts but not everyone can jeapordize a corps

Thanks to a referall by futplex I see the error in my question....
Netscape is infact offering money and other freebees but some Kevin Mitnick
would rather have fun with it like messing with netscape or wait for the
Final v.2.0 to come out then have alot of fun!!!
anyway thanks again Futplex,
               the one and only,

@_subject: Netscape question transformed 
I would like to rephrase the question I had yesterday was
completely misunderstood.  The point I was meaning to make was soppuse to
be as follows:
        Why would a compony like Netscape jeapordise themselves by even
letting                                               out a beta version so
hackers have time to find bugs before the full version is released. Don't
take me wrong I have only been on the net fer a little over a year and Love
Netscape.  And If I knew what I was Doing I would love to help them.....
        Anyway I don't mean to waste your time, but arent these kinda
things for stating your opinion?  And to clarify any questions on my age I
am 13 and was born in 1982.ok? thanks.....And I would again like to thank
perry for understanding what level Im on. I will try my best not to annoy
you or cause you any inconvenience.  And to sameer I am sorry for what I
said but you have to understyand Why I said it......
                        Sincerely,
                                CyberPunc X

@_subject: applications 
I know this isnt what you guys generally talk about but I was curious.
Off the top of your head do you know of any sites where I can get kracking
apps for macs?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.
