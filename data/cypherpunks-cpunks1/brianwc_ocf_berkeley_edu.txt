@_subject: Hey guys, here is another (great?) idea 
It would work better from a technical perspective only. From an overall
view "requiring" anyone who runs a tor client to run a tor server would
not be good for the project. There would be backlash. We've seen that
some websites (Slashdot, Wikipedia, Gentoo Forums) can take action
against tor server operators that can be frustrating to resolve. If
people who just want to run the client through a cool Firefox extension
don't understand that they may also get banned from certain websites
because they are "required" to also run a tor server, then we will hear
from those frustrated users and the project/extension will get a bad
rap. Instead, we should just make it really easy for people to opt-in to
contributing some bandwidth as a server. Enough people would opt-in if
it were really simple that we would probably still see some performance
I also have an idea for scaling the # of tor servers dramatically that
I'll post about soon. I like this firefox extension idea a lot though too.

@_subject: Interoperating with p2p traffic 
If an anonymizing service based on Tor were integrated into some p2p
project or if a fork of Tor were to devote itself to serving p2p, then
that should only be encouraged by the current Tor community if
1. It didn't take away any current tor servers or tor resources.
2. It used another name and was clearly its own standalone effort.
The reason for 1 is obvious. If the point is to make Tor more usable,
then we shouldn't support a migration of its resources elsewhere.
The reason for 2 should also be obvious. Tor is a neutral technology
that allows privacy. Some people use their privacy for uses we want to
support; others for uses we wish they wouldn't engage in. But, if
something were called "Tor" and were devoted to p2p traffic then it
would taint the whole Tor project. Don't get me wrong. p2p also has
legitimate uses. But in the current climate anything remotely associated
with file-sharing is assumed to be illegal. Let's not let that shadow be
cast upon Tor. It has enough reputational problems already.
Also, Tor is open source. If someone wants to take the code and change
it to use their own farm of servers exclusively for p2p traffic then
there's nothing the Tor community can do to stop them. I'm not
suggesting we should try to stop them. Rather, I'm suggesting we insist
that if someone does do that, then they should not call it "Tor" or
anything confusingly similar.
