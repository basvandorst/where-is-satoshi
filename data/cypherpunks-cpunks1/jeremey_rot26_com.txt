BTW, most and probably all of the major mail clients out there will do
STARTTLS *for SMTP*. It's a matter of servers offering it and clients
being configured to actually use it. It'd be nice if they always used it
if it's available, but right now I think they all require being told to.
Specifically, Mozilla, Outlook, Outlook Express, Netscape (all the way
back to 4.7x at least), Evolution, and Eudora all support STARTTLS
(again, for SMTP). I imagine there are others that do as well.
Amusingly, virtually none of them support STARTLS on any other protocol.
:) IMAP and POP are almost all supported only on dedicated SSL ports
(IMAPS, POP3S). Argh.

Yes, Eudora is the exception. It supports both STARTTLS and dedicated
SSL ports for all mail protocols (it even does SMTPS I think).

The extra 4 bits add quite a bit, subjectively. I've compared the same
CD on the same system with an HDCD player and non-HDCD player.
The other formats of note are probably SACD and then DVD-Audio. SACD
is multichannel 16-bit/44.1kHz... so multichannel CD without additional
sample resolution (if I recall). SACD is not "backwards compatible"
though, whereas HDCD is.
DVD-Audio is really the way to go, though... 24-bit/96kHz multichannel
or up to 192kHz two-channel. Lots more bits, lots more samples. It makes
a huge difference on "pretty good or better" gear.
