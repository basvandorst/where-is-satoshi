Don't forget the reserves in additional to the Guard. One point, its a bit of a stretch to call the guard or reserves "weekend
warriors" anymore.  Many of those units are deployed on active duty for
long stretches of time (12 months or longer) due to increasing military
committments around the world.  Further, many of the SF groups, which
see a lot of use these days, are part of the National Guard as well and
rarely go unused by the Pentagon.
