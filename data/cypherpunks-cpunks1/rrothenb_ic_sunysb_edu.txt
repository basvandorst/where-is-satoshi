@_subject: How much entropy in a key press? 
Depends. You could use a fast timer and sample between keystrokes, then
use the least significant byte of the difference like PGP does (for DOS,
anyway).  You could change that so it samples bits instead of bytes,
but it's conceivable that you'll have less randomness that way.
I've experimented with speeding up the timer IRQs on my PC for that but
found it was superficially less random (in a pool of 256 bytes there
were more duplicates).
With a decent timerr that samples bytes, I'd say 16 keystrokes. Use
a cypher overtha random data to garbe it a bit.

I beg to differ. Remember the "Seven Dirty Words Case"? (I think WBAI/Pacifica

say on television" skit and was taken to court. The court ruled that there
were some obscene things which could be censored, but other things were
indecent so could at most be relegated to late night hours (and they've
struck down laws banning indecency 24 hours... I think some stations are
suing with the claim that such relegation constitutes censorship).
Don't remember their exact formulation, which isn't very exact anyway.
Perhaps it was deemed too indecent to be on an archive site. Hell, they
cooperated plenty with the government on this.

No disagreements with your reply. Of course the first amendment (or the rest
of the Bill of Rights) has stopped legislators from passing restrictive laws.
The line between indecency and obscenity is vague. Legal defense fees are
not... not are opportunistic prosecutors-- which is a real problem. Look at
what happened to Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys if you'd like an
example. I've heard that there were recently busts in Florida of some BBS
systems that carried the alt.sex* groups while universities in the area which
also carried them weren't touched.
The "safe harbor" is 10pm, but many radio stations (like WUSB here in Stony
Brook, where I do some radio programming) use midnight as a safe time and
give periodic warnings during shows in any indecent material is aired.
Problems with these vague and-or unenforcable "decency" laws is that they
allow for selective enforcement which is often motivated more by politics
and personal greed than by their alleged concerns for decency.

: From kevin at elvis.wicat.com
Without quoting the entire message, I think I better solution, in terms of
ease to implement as well as conserving bandwidth would be to have a
sophisticated remailer script-language.
For instance, the script language could tell the remailer to check if a
site is on-line (perhaps within certain GMT hours or dates) and use the
next site if not available, or to randomly choose from a list of sites
the active ones, etc.
Maybe even have it work with a data haven? Mail the message to a data haven
and send another message to a remailer chain to pull the message from the
data haven and post the data (not flaws in this: don't want remailers getting
files from people's accounts and posting them to usenet etc.).
Seems like this is a "safer" solution that is more flexible then broadcasting
which remailers are active. Also allows for future add-ons like delays,
file-splitting, etc.

As a somehow related note, my experience with some past jobs is that in
some circumstances the employee turnover rate is high enough that a manager
will give a neutral or good rating simply because they have no experience
with a previous employee who clearly did not deserve a good rating.
Something similar could happen with mailing lists... hardly anyone can
remember when a 'newbie' posted to a list a few years ago, irregardless
of whether a person is still worth a certain rating after a time.
Then again, with a lot of material being archived, it might be easier in
some circumstances to review a person's contributions to a list rather
than rely on a rating... or maybe send a trusted rater to research an
author on the 'net for you rather than maintain a huge database of
ratings that will need some form of interpretation.
Then again, (as Tim and others noted) there's alws killfiles and manual
glossing over of threads, etc.

Though the best way is to experiment... I wrote a DOS ISR to capture
timings between clicks ('keyrand?.zip' on some ftp-sites) and experimented
with speeding up the system clock (which is normally 18.2 times/sec), but
the entropy appeared lower (superficially less random).

Sounds like it's time for a Snake-Oil FAQ...

There's some sort of documentary on WBAI 99.5 FM out of NYC now.
They're talking about PGP and right wing militias... the guy being
interviewed called PGP a "one time pad system" and doesn't understand
it... *sigh*

I forget the name of the show, it was on Tues. night (last night) after
Pacifica (around midnight)... I wrote and sent the message while I was
hearing it.  I stopped after bleating out the message and listened to
some of the show, which was about right wing militias, Weaver case, Okla bomb,
etc... turns out I missed the short part where the person being interviewed
(duh, should've written his name down) mentioned PGP, which he also said
stood for "Pretty Good Program".  Wish I had more details of the show...
(BTW, I'm temporarily off the c'punks list)
