WASHINGTON, DC (April 6, 2006) - During a hearing before the House
Judiciary Committee today, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-CA) questioned
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales about the NSA's secret domestic
wiretapping program.
 The Administration has cited the Authorization to Use Military Force
and the commander in chief powers as authorizing the NSA to intercept
international communications into and out of the U.S. of persons linked
to al Qaeda or related terrorist organizations.
 After citing his concerns that there was no limiting principle to the
Administration's claim of authority in the War on Terror, Rep. Schiff
asked the Attorney General whether the Administration believes it has
the authority to wiretap purely domestic calls between two Americans
without seeking a warrant.
"I cannot rule that out," responded the Attorney General.
 "This is very disturbing testimony," Rep. Schiff commented later, "and
represents a wholly unprecedented assertion of executive power.  No one
in Congress would deny the need to tap certain calls under court order
