@_subject: FCC Regulation (fwd) 
Forwarded from the com-priv mailing list:
(UPI) WASHINGTON, DC.  The White House confirmed today that the
FCC will become the Federal agency to assume responsibility for
regulating the so-called "Information Super Highway."  Today this
consists of an autonomous network of computers known collectively
as the Internet.  Usually reliable sources revealed that the
government is becoming increasingly apprehensive about the
Internet's uncontrolled growth and the potential for damage to
national security.  A highly placed government source was quoted
as saying "...now anyone with a thousand dollars can obtain the
computer hardware and software necessary to communicate on the
Internet.  Irresponsible individuals can easily transmit messages
worldwide.  Clearly, there is a need for government regulation."
     In response to these concerns the FCC is rumored to be
preparing restrictive regulations to assure "responsible use" of
the Internet.  The FCC is reportedly cooperating with other
national and international agencies to coordinate these
regulations.  Several former eastern bloc countries and Italy are
reportedly coordinating their internal regulation planning with
the FCC.
     Although details are sketchy at this time, these new
regulations are likely to take the form of some sort of license
examination for Internet users.  Despite the fact that a costly
new government bureaucracy will be established, it will likely
save money in the long run, according to government sources. "A
single USENET posting may cost hundreds if not thousands of
dollars, therefore, if licensing reduces such postings by only
10% the savings will more than recover these additional costs",
said a highly placed government source.
     Expert government watchers have been able to piece together
a fairly comprehensive picture of the soon-to-be-proposed license
requirements. Based upon the past history of the FCC, the test
will likely consist of three parts:  theory, jurisprudence and
     The theory portion of the examination will include written
examination of the principles of digital logic, elements of
generic machine language programming, and comprehensive knowledge
of TCP/IP and network interfacing hardware.
     The jurisprudence portion will assess the candidate's basic
knowledge of the regulations governing use of the Internet and
will cover ethical as well as legal issues.  Licensing will
likely include an "Internet oath" requirement in which the
candidate will swear to uphold certain basic standards of
conduct.  Users of the Internet will be required to broadcast
their license numbers at logon and intermittently after
connection to the Internet.
     The practice portion of the examination is likely to be the
most controversial.  Reportedly, all candidates must pass a
typing skills examination and achieve no less than 40 words per
minute to obtain a (temporary) novice license. This must be
raised to 80 words per minute before a regular-status license
will be  issued. Novices will restricted to operating networked
computers having speeds of less than 5 Mhz or operation of SLIP
or dial-up connections of no greater than 2400 baud. (It is
rumored that the FCC will make 5 Mhz replacement crystals
available at a nominal charge to temporarily slow computers of
novice operators).
     The FCC also recognizes that there are conditions when
terminal emulators are not available.  Therefore, an expert class
will be established for communication using only numeric keypads
and bi-digit numeric displays.  Although needing a minimum of
equipment, this mode will require sending, receiving and manual
translation of raw ASCII codes.  Guidelines for minimum
communication rates for this mode have yet to be established
while the FCC awaits public input.  Although felt to be a
desirable goal for all users, this class of license will only be
required by individuals operating wireless (RF) LANS.
     Asked what the effect of proposed regulations would have on
the Internet, a highly placed official noted that these rules
"should not be considered prohibitive, as they simply bring
regulation of the Internet in line with other communication modes
under FCC governance."  However, the source did feel that such
regulations should be very helpful in restraining the rapid
growth of the Internet.

I see. It's the ole "It's worse in other places so quit bitching." Sure, it's worse in a lot of places. This is the U.S.A. (or it is where I am). We use most of the world's resources and we are leaders in quite a few technologies (or close to it). That doesn't mean that when things are getting shitty here I have to tolerate it because "it could be worse" or "you could live under a REALLY repressive government." I don't want to live under ANY repressive government, period.

Only marginally topical if at all but the .sig about Irish citizenship prompted me to remember something I had heard: is it true that if you can prove German ancestry sometime since the unification of Germany (the first time), you can get citizenship there easily? Germany has its repressive laws but two of my great-grandparents came from what was formerly Prussia a little over 100 years ago.

Just thought that someone might be interested in checking out this

of big name MPD/SRA speakers including Roland Summit, Bennett Braun, Colin

and were joined by Catherine Gould (who wrote the check list of clinical
indicators of satanic ritual abuse). "For Immediate Release:"

Cyber-porn Cover up--
Conference Unmasks Washington D.C. Computer Ring's Link to
High Officials
IRVINE, Calif -- Tasked with informing the nation about the
prevalence of sexual crimes against children.  The National
Criminal Justice Task Force, a national multi-disciplinary
group of judges, prosecutors, medical doctors and psychotherapists,
is hosting the second national conference on Crimes Against
Children, September 22-25 at Washington D.C.'s Ramada
Renaissance Hotel.
Slated for discussion is the first alleged cyber-porn ring --
the "Finders", a shadowy techno-cult allegedly specializing
in electronic networks, disseminating child pornography and
possibly smuggling children.
According to Detective Sergeant Larry Lawson, of Florida, the
mysterious group was discovered in Tallahassee in 1987 (? illegible)
when police stopped a van driven by two adults, allegedly
en-route to Mexico, carrying a cargo of six children, ages
3 to 6 years.
Raiding a D.C. warehouse, D.C. Metro officers uncovered
computers, detailed kindapping {sic} plans, child/animal
blood-ritual photographs, and overseas orders for children.
When a U.S. Customs/Washington Metro Police investigation was
launched, the FBI's Counter-Intelligence Unit shut it down.
Only under pressure from members of Congress-who just received
information from associates of the National Criminal Justice
Task Force - did the Justice Department renew the investigation.
Uncovered recently is information that links corrupt federal
officials to child-trafficking, as well as the use of
influence to cover up their involvement with the Finders.

 Subject: POD E-Mail Bill of Rights
 I'm enclosing a document put together by Frank Connolly at American
 University that is the most carefully articulated document establishing
 networking protocol I have come across.
 David Way
 ================   TEXT OF THE BILL FOLLOWS ===============================
 PREAMBLE
 In order to protect the rights and recognize the responsibilities of
 individuals and institutions, we, the members of the
 educational community, propose this Bill of Rights and
 Responsibilities for the Electronic Community of Learners.
 These principles are based on a recognition that the electronic
 community is a complex subsystem of the educational
 community founded on the values espoused by that community.
 As new technology modifies the system and further empowers
 individuals, new values and responsibilities will change this
 culture.  As technology assumes an integral role in education
 and lifelong learning, technological empowerment of
 individuals and organizations becomes a requirement and right
 for students, faculty, staff, and institutions, bringing with it new
 levels of responsibility that individuals and institutions have to
 themselves and to other members of the educational
 community.
 ARTICLE I: INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
 The original Bill of Rights explicitly recognized that all
 individuals have certain fundamental rights as members of the
 national community. In the same way, the citizens of the
 electronic community of learners have fundamental rights that
 empower them.
 Section 1.
 A citizen's access to computing and information resources shall
 not be denied or removed without just cause.
 Section 2.
 The right to access includes the right to appropriate training and
 tools required to effect access.
 Section 3.
 All citizens shall have the right to be informed about personal
 information that is being and has been collected about them, and
 have the right to review and correct that information,.  Personal
 information about a citizen shall not be used for other than the
 expressed purpose of its collection without the explicit
 permission of that citizen.
 Section 4.
 The constitutional concept of freedom of speech applies to
 citizens of electronic communities.
 Section 5.
 All citizens of the electronic community of learners have
 ownership rights over their own intellectual works.
 ARTICLE II: INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES
 Just as certain rights are given to each citizen of the electronic
 community of learners, each citizen is held accountable for his
 or her actions.  The interplay of rights and responsibilities
 within each individual and within the community engenders
 the trust and intellectual freedom that form the heart of our
 society. This trust and freedom are grounded on each person's
 developing the skills necessary to be an active and contributing
 citizen of the electronic community. These skills include an
 awareness and knowledge about information technology and
 the uses of information and an understanding of the roles in the
 electronic community of learners.
 Section 1.
 It shall be each citizen's personal responsibility to actively
 pursue needed resources: to recognize when information is
 needed, and to be able to find, evaluate, and effectively use
 information.
 Section 2.
 It shall be each citizen's personal responsibility to recognize
 (attribute) and honor the intellectual property of others.
 Section 3.
 Since the electronic community of learners is based upon the
 integrity and authenticity of information, it shall be each
 citizen's personal responsibility to be aware of the potential for
 and possible effects of manipulating electronic information: to
 understand the fungible nature of electronic information; and to
 verify the integrity and authenticity, and assure the security of
 information that he or she compiles or uses.
 Section 4.
 Each citizen, as a member of the electronic community of
 learners, is responsible to all other citizens in that community:
 to respect and value the rights of privacy for all; to recognize and
 respect the diversity of the population and opinion in the
 community; to behave ethically; and to comply with legal
 restrictions regarding the use of information resources.
 Section 5.
 Each citizen, as a member of the electronic community of
 learners, is responsible to the community as a whole to
 understand what information technology resources are
 available, to recognize that the members of the community
 share them, and to refrain from acts that waste resources or
 prevent others from using them.
 ARTICLE III: RIGHTS OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
 Educational institutions have legal standing similar to that of
 individuals.  Our society depends upon educational institutions
 to educate our citizens and advance the development of
 knowledge.  However, in order to survive, educational
 institutions must attract financial and human resources.
 Therefore, society must grant these institutions the rights to the
 electronic resources and information necessary to accomplish
 their goals.
 Section 1.
 The access of an educational institutions to computing and
 information resources shall not be denied or removed without
 just cause.
 Section 2.
 Educational institutions in the electronic community of learners
 have ownership rights over the intellectual works they create.
 Section 3.
 Each educational institution has the authority to allocate
 resources in accordance with its unique institutional mission.
 ARTICLE IV: INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
 Just as certain rights are assured to educational institutions in
 the electronic community of learners, so too each is held
 accountable for the appropriate exercise of those rights to foster
 the values of society and to carry out each institution's mission.
 This interplay of rights and responsibilities within the
 community fosters the creation and maintenance of an
 environment wherein trust and intellectual freedom are the
 foundation for individual and institutional growth and success.
 Section 1.
 The institutional members of the electronic community of
 learners have a responsibility to provide all members of their
 community with legally acquired computer resources (hardware,
 software, networks, data bases, etc.) in all instances where access
 to or use of the resources is an integral part of active
 participation in the electronic community of learners.
 Section 2.
 Institutions have a responsibility to develop, implement, and
 maintain security procedures to insure the integrity of
 individual and institutional files.
 Section 3.
 The institution shall treat electronically stored information as
 confidential.  The institution shall treat all personal files as
 confidential, examining or disclosing the contents only when
 authorized by the owner of the information, approved by the
 appropriate institutional official, or required by local, state or
 federal law.
 Section 4.
 Institutions in the electronic community of learners shall train
 and support faculty, staff, and students to effectively use
 information technology.  Training includes skills to use the
 resources, to be aware of the existence of data repositories and
 techniques for using them, and to understand the ethical and
 legal uses of the resources.
