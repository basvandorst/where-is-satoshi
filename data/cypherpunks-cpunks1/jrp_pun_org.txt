@_subject: why should it be trusted?   
Isn't utterly obvious that the NSA, just any decent person, compartmentalizes its security so that if one system were
broken, the other systems would not necessarily be broken?
Also, compromise of the other systems would not be publicized,
necessarily, and they are smaller and more easily replaced
with new systems.
