@_subject: Required- Direct e-mail(Bulk) service 
We are looking forward to conduct a Bulk e-mail (HTML) campaign targeting
the SMEs and hence a bulk e-mail service provider. In this concern I would
like to know a few details:
1) Do you mail HTML mails?
2) In the context of the campaign can you host our micro site as until the
campaign gets over?
3) Do you provide targeted e-mail addresses targeting the SMEs?
I would appreciate if you can mail me the cost involved and any additional
service you provide in the domain of targeted bulk e-mail campaigns, ASAP.
