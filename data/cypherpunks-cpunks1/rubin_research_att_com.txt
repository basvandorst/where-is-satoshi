@_subject: List of crypto-related courses 
For the last year or so, I have built and maintained a list of graduate
level courses on cryptography and security. The current list can be found
at    http:/
I would like to keep this list as current as possible, so if you have
any additions/corrections, etc, please let me know. I am only interested
in full-semester courses at universities.
Thank you,

Thanks for all of the wonderful information on courses. As a result,
the list has really grown and been corrected in several places. The
newest version can be found at
