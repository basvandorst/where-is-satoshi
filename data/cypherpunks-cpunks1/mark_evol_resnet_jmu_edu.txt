Although I haven't looked into this at all, somehow I can see them
requiring some sort of proprietary mailreader that *won't* let you
delete the ads without reading them (and probably not standards-based
either, so you couldn't replace it with something that would let you
skip the ads.)
Foo. You get what you pay for.

I haven't seen Goodlatte's legislation, but I can safely say he
doesn't have our privacy rights at heart. Bob Goodlatte (my local
representative) was the CC toadie partially responsible for putting
"indecent" back in the CDA. I don't trust him any further than I can
spit on him.
I'll keep an eye on this. I'm very suspicious of his intentions.
