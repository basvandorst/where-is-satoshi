@_subject: Cookies on Microsoft Explorer? 
Whatever the conditions/causes for the cookiefest, I make it known to them that the volume of cookies gives me electronic diabetes, and move on. I suspect that there will eventually be enough people that dislike being force-fed cookies and complaining about it that such sites will either fold, or get a klew.

I can testify to the integration and effectiveness of Pronto Secure (Windows version), which I've changed over to from Eudora Pro. As near as I can tell, PGP interface is seamless. Don't know if that's what you're looking for.

Don't know that I'm a 'bomb expert', but it would appear reasonable that 6 just-under-a-pound bombs would do approximately as much damage as a similarly sized larger device.
Even if the 6 devices got scattered to two or more aircraft, the terror factor would be significant

@_subject: 1024-bit keys 
In the documentation for Web Commander (page 7-50, item 19, top of page), under the process for getting a digital ID from VeriSign, you state:
"Also, please note that you cannot send keys longer than 512 to servers outside the United States."
I would like to ask for clarification on this point. Is this meant to say that a server inside the United States is not allowed to use a 512+ bit key with a client outside the U.S., or that a Web Commander server outside the U.S. may not employ a key of greater than 512 bits? In either case, what is the justification for such a statement/restriction? If a Federal regulation, could you please cite the Title and Section?
Thank you.

Absent any ability to cite a chapter-and-verse for making such a statement, and considering the vagueness of it, I would suggest that it either be clarified, justified, or removed.
I would think that, in it's present form, that statement leaves Luckman in no small amount of jeopardy: if true, but misunderstood because of lack of reference, anyone violating it may seek redress against Luckman in the event of prosecution by some law enforcement agency. If untrue, Luckman could be considered equally liable for any real or perceived lost income because of an erroneous limitation, when it's incorrectness is discovered.

@_subject: IE3.0 128-bit 
Just got off of MS IE3 download page. To retrieve the 128-bit version, they've got a perl script asking for a remote address and a host address via a pair of cookies. Unfortunately, it chokes *every single time* it's invoked on my system, and shows me a 1-800 number (terminally busy) to Has anyone either managed to download it, or gotten through to the 1-800 number? I'd _really_ like a copy of the 128-bit version. I'm a U.S. citizen, live here in Amarillo, TX.
Anyone from MicroSloth reading this *might* want to let a Responsible Person know about the perl script hiccups....

I *finally* managed to get through to the 1-800 number that pops up when an attempted download of 128-bit MSIE 3.0 fails. They can only send out 128-bit version *2.0*, it seems. They referred me to the 1-800 Sales number, but of course, the sales droids weren't savvy enough to understand the problem, and tried to hand me off to a 206 area code number. At that point, I called off the drill - I'm not going to pay for a toll call to fix MS's screwup.
"original" 800 number: 1-800-455-2959
Alternate 800 number: 1-800-426-9400 (autobot) - select 3, then 4, then 1 to get a Real Person.
Anyone else upset about being denied might want to give them a call, too. Who knows, maybe if they get enough calls, they'll send someone to fix it.
