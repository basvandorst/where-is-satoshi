@_subject: "encrypt tcp connections" hacks 
I realize this may be heresy, but have you considered a hardware solution?
Cisco is currently offering a version of their popular routers with a builtin
Zylink crypto box... uses either DES or a "proprietary single bit CFB mode"
system (maybe RC4?) which is exportable.  The boxes are relatively
inexpensive.  Zylink offers just the crypto box for even less.  Both boxes
offer DH key management.
