@_subject: ADV: "A Cup Of Strength" 
Do you feel tired most of the time?  Do you feel a lack of energy to do your daily chores?
 You are not alone - it's the way of life in today's  fast paced world. Business is done at the speed of  light and effects everyone. Whether you are a home maker,
 student, factory worker or a busy executive, we all feel
 a sense of tiredness, if not exhaustion. We can take food
 supplements and other remedies to continue our day.
 2000 years ago the Greeks, the Persians and the Masters
 from the Himilayas knew about a spice (seed of a herb)
 and used to eat this in different forms to build power
 in their body to fight battles, to build muscles and
 re-energize their sex drive.
 Breath and sex energy are the very essence of all things in this
 manifested universe. This herbal tea helps to strengthen
 both the respiratory and reproductive system.  It is very easy and very inexpensive to make this tea. It is pure
 and absolutely natural. Only 3 ingredients are required and
 you can pick these up at almost any grocery store or
 supermarket. It shouldn't cost you more than 50 cents at  the most to make a whole large mug of tea. Preparing this
 tea is as easy as 1..2..3..
 Your friends and folks will want to know your secret - where
 you get your jubilant energy from. When the rest of the  work force is fading away, craving for the lunch hour to arrive,
 you get your second wind.
 Enjoy a cup of strength. Live an energetic day each day and
 prepare you body for romance.
 Enjoy! The cost is only US$5. Yes, you will get much more use
 value than the money you will pay for this magnificent tea.
 If it does help you, it becomes priceless. You decide.  If you buy, you risk nothing, if you don't buy just think
 what you just risked? For US $5 you will enjoy this "Cup of
 Strength" for the rest of your life.
