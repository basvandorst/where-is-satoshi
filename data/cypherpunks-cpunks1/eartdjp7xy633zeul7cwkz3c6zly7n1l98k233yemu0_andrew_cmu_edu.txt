Encryption Plan Gets Gov't Nod
 By Sharon Fisher
WASHINGTON    Encryption users and industry observers have said
they are unhappy with the Clinton administration's endorsement of
a comprehensive interagency review of cryptographic technology.
 The review was initiated last April and overseen by the Na- tional
Security Council. It was scheduled to have been complet- ed by
mid-October of last year.
 As part of the Feb. 4 release of the report, the administration
said it has approved the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) as
a voluntary Federal In- formation Processing Standard.
 The EES, known as both the Clipper proposal and Skipjack, was
announced last April.
 The administration also said that the National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology and the Automated Services Division of the
Treasury Department would be charged with storing the escrowed
keys. The procedures for gaining access to the keys were also
 The ESS proposal has been heavily citicized because of
the escrow proposal, which gives law enforcement agencies access
to the encryption keys via a warrantmuch like a wiretap. Industry
observers have said an algoithm with such keys is inherently
insecure. They voiced concern at the government's plans to keep
the algorithm classified (Comm Week, Jan. 3).
 Critics said the ESS is a first step toward outlawing
other forms of cryptog raphy, but the administration reiterated at
the announcement that it had no such intention.
 Industry groups such as the Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, both based
here, immediately launched grassroots protests against the
announcements. Both groups have citicized the proposal since it
was first announced. -

WHAT 4TH AMENDMENT? HERE COMES THE CLIPPER ENCRYPTION PLAN
YOU'RE A CRIMINAL. That person sitting next to you is a criminal, too. All of
the people you work with are criminals. How do I know this? I get
it straight from the federal government.
In fact, the federal government is so certain you're a criminal
that the executive branch has just announced a new way to pry
into your affairs, steal your correspondence, read your electronic
mail, and listen in on your most private conversations. Not only
that, but the Clinton administration wants you to pay for
the privilege of having the government keep tabs on you. The
administration claims that it's doing all of this as a way to
fight crime, and since you're the one its targeting, apparently
the Clinton administration has decided you're a criminal. By now,
of course, you probably know what I'm writing about, but in case
you've been in a cave for a couple of weeks, here's a summary.
Earlier this month, the administration announced that the government
was going ahead with its plans to start using the infamous Clipper
chip -- that's the one that encrypts information, but includes a
government-sponsored backdoor -- for the Justice and Defense
departments. You're going to pay about $2,000 for each of the
initial 50,000 or so Clipper-encrypted phones and similar terminal
devices the government buys.
Once the government starts using Clipper equipment, the plan
is for these agencies to require anyone dealing with them to use
it also. Meanwhile, you must provide a way for the government
to listen in to your telephone system. You get to pay for the
new or modified equipment. Finally, sources tell us, the adminis-
tration plans to outlaw any form of encryption other than that
approved by the government. You get to pay for any changes
these new systems require, too. No doubt you're thinking that
the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is supposed to
prevent your papers and effects, among other things, from un-
reasonable search and seizure. Is it reasonable to be required
to hand over materials in a form the government wishes so that
it can search you conveniently? It's not unlike being required to
carry on your phone conversations in English for the convenience
of government listeners who may not understand, say, pig latin.
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. In his debate on the ratifiation
of the Constitution, Patrick Henry predicted that the gov-
ernment'may, unless the general government be restrained by a
Bill of Rights ". . . go into your cellars and rooms, and search,
ran sack and measure everything you eat, drink and wear. They ought
to be restrained." Of course, Henry didn't know computers would
exist, but he knew of their analogue at the time-a person's papers
and effects and that's why he fought successfully for an
amendment to restrain the government. Now it appears that the
government would slip its restraints. Apparently, in this new
world of technology and digital communications, prying into one's
affairs has become difficult. It's inconvenient to search an
office, after all. It requires work.
Instead, the government wants to read your electronic papers and
effects, and it wants you to pay for it. The Bill of Rights? I
guess that's become inconvenient, too.

Editor's View
E-MAIL DESTINATION: BLACK HOLE, WHITE HOUSE
Is the Clinton adminisration really an ally of the communications
and networking community, or are the politicians only jerking our
The answer to this imortant question seems to vary day to day.
A few weeks ago I received four elecronic-mail communiques from
the White House Office of Media Affairs. This caught my attention
for several reasons.
First, the administration is not in the habit of communicat-
ing with the trade press so I was impressed with this outreach.
(Cool move, guys.) Next, the messages were targeted at key
journalists using the preferred medium du jour: electronic mail.
(Very cool!) Finally, all four messages were dispatched the same
I was most interested in a message detailing the administration's
efforts to communicate over electronic networks.
The Clinton administration's Electronc Public Access Project
has achieved some important milestones during its first year.
According to the project's press release:
lt has received over 100,000 E-mail messages to the president
and the vice president since it started on June 1, 1993;
It established Internet addresses and accepts E-mail from
the public;
It has electronically processed over 220,000 requests for
information since September 1, 1993; 1,600 public documents were
published electronically last year;
It established forums on America Online, CompuServe, GEnie and
MCI Mail.
The project plans this year to publish the national budget and
other public documents on CD-ROM. It also plans to refine existing
electronic com munications techniques via the Internet.
I applaud the administration for these innovations. But I
also have some reservations.
For one, it's looks great on the surface that the administration
has set up so many channels for communication. Yet this is the
key question: Is anyone really listening?
E-mail questions do not get electronic replies from administration
officials. Questioners (if they are lucky) get back a letter --
via the U.S. Postal Service. This sounds more like a black hoel
than a viable communications process.
The president did respond at least once via E-mail -- to a group
of fifth-graders in Oxford, Ohio, last spring.
At best the opinions of communications and networking experts seem
to be ignored; at worst they have been rejected by the president.
An example is the president's recent adoption of the socalled
"Clipper Chip." This encoding/decoding scheme was devloped by
the National Security Agency to assist government agencies to
evesdrop on digital communications.
Virtually every major computer and communications company, opinion
maker, and civil rights group opposes the use of this technology.
apparently, however, the president doesn't care what we think.
This action has jilted our enthusiasm for the administration's
avowed embrace of communications technology. It's beginning to
look more like a charade to keep techies playing with their toys
instead of a mature partnership in molding our technological

It was the second attempt in three days to get the powerful booster
