We are seeking the help of overseas users of The Electronic Telegraph to better understand how we may develop our Expat Portal, Global Network to suit their needs.  As someone who has previously registered with the Electronic Telegraph, you are well placed to provide us with the feedback we require and I would really appreciate your participation.
This is part of a major exercise to review our plans for the site and its relationship with the Weekly Telegraph newspaper.  We would very much appreciate your co-operation in completing our survey since we need responses from users from all around the world.  The survey may be completed on-line at:

MPG International, an independent market research firm, is running the survey on our behalf, and it is by this means that we can ensure absolute confidentiality for the information you provide.
As a reward, all respondents will be entered into a prize draw* for one of ten $100 vouchers at amazon.com which you may spend on any of the products available from them - books, CDs, games, etc..
May I thank you in advance for your help.
Yours sincerely,
