@_subject: cypherpunks email list help? 
Anyone know the phone number of the cypherpunks list owner?
I have tried for weeks to remove my duplicate email address
entries from the list - probably placed there as a result
of the email list scroggings of late... so far I
have not gotten any response from:
  majordomo at toad.com (reply indicates request forwarded to
  hughes at toad.com
  hughes at ah.com
Any advice would be appreciated... thank you.

Any Zmail users out there with nifty PGP encrypt/decrypt scripts they are
willing to share?
