Is the BBS PRNG covered by any patents anywhere? How about the
probabilistic encryption public-key cryptosystem?
If anyone has a BBS PRNG working on a 486 could they please send me
a the clock frequency and bytes/sec they can generate for some
common moduli: 512, 1024, and 2048, say. I am close to having
an implementation which will run at 500 bytes/sec on a 486 DX/2
with a 1024 bit modulus and am not sure if that is competitively
fast or not.

@_subject: Pseudo-DC-net Project 
I am working on a project to implement a variation of a DC-net to be run
over the Internet. I am posting this summary to find out if it overlaps
with projects others are working on; to see what members of the lists think
of the general ideas for the network I have in mind; and to see if anyone
is interested in helping me out.
The variation of a DC-net I have in mind will vary in three important ways from a true DC-net: Difference (1) (Pseudo-random numbers) It will use pseudo-random numbers in place of true random numbers. Difference (2) (Star shaped network)
The graph of the network will be star shaped instead of completely
connected. Difference (3) (MACs)
Messages broadcast on the pseudo-DC-net will have a MAC appended in a key shared by the channel participants.
Difference (4) (Encryption)
Messages sent to the channel will be encrypted in a key shared by the
Because of these difference from a true DC-net I will refer to the network
I have in mind as a "pseudo-DC-net". Difference (1) is desirable since
current techniques for generating true random numbers on PC's are slow, and
distribution of the resulting true random numbers is enormously consumptive
in terms of bandwidth. Difference (2) is made possible by the use of
pseudo-random number generators, and is desirable since it reduces the
total number of messages that need to transferred.  Difference (3) is
desirable to identify messages broadcast by unauthorized parties to the
network, and, as a side benefit, to help clients filter out collisions---
when two parties try to broadcast at the same time. Difference (4) is desirable so that eavesdroppers cannot determine what messages are being broadcast to the network.   Difference (1) implies a downgrading of the level of anonymity from
unconditional to cryptographic, and difference (2) opens the possibility for
protocol attacks.  I would like to break this project up into three parts: a formal protocol
specification, a client implementation or implementations, and a server
implementation or implementations. I would like the formal protocol
specification to be publicly available to allow anyone to write their own
clients and servers, and to communicate their criticisms of the protocol.
The protocol will not dictate what pseudo-random number generator is to be
used, although there will be a note of a rule to ensure that pairs of users
are using the same generator for the "coin flips" they share. Similarly,
the protocol should be flexible enough to allow the use of any reasonable
length MAC.  A general outline of the protocols I have in mind are as follows: Protocol (1) (Channel registration protocol) Channels will be registered with the server. A channel will be specified by
a time frame in which a pseudo-DC-net is to be run; the IP address and port
to which clients are to connect to join the channel; the length of each
message block to be transmitted to the channel; and a channel ID. Protocol (2) (Pseudo-DC-net real-time protocol)
The protocol for running the channel will consist of a series of "rounds". Each round will consist of the following steps:
 Step (1) The transmission of a round synchronization number from the server
 to the clients, along with a string of bits specifying the set of users  connected. Old clients should make sure that the synchronization number  is consistent with the synchronization number of the previous round.  Step (2) Receipt by the server from each client of a block of input
 for that round. (If the user does not wish to broadcast, this will be the  XOR sum of the next blocks in the the pseudo-random number streams shared  by the user with the other users (call this sum S). If the user wishes  to broadcast, it will be the encryption of the following: the XOR of S  with a message consisting of the concatenation of the channel id, round  number, message length, message, message padding, and MAC of these five  components.)  Step (3) Transmission from the server to each client of the XOR sum of  the blocks received.
Protocol (3) (Optional Payment Protocol)
I would like to add the option for the server to charge e-cash for the
administration of the channel.
I have also thought about an extension in which messages to the server
would be signed so that the server could prevent an unauthorized user
from hijacking a connection and disrupting a channel. If you would like to help me out with this project, if it overlaps with
something you are already doing or have done, or you just think my ideas
are no good (or good! :) ), please let me know. I am especially interested
in attacks in which the server lies about the round number or set of
connected users. If this project is works out well, I would like to later work on protocols for voting using a pseudo-DC-net. Leonard Janke

@_subject: Synchronization Attack on Pseudo-DC-net's 
Here's an easy attack on a pseudo-DC-net that I thought up over lunch if
the clients trust the server to be honest in telling both the round number
and who is on.
Let Stephanie be the person running the server, and let Alice and Bob be
two users.  Let f(n) be the pseudo random function they share.   Assume
that Stephanie knows their secret encryption key.  It is then possible
for her to compromise their anonymity as follows: First Alice joins the
net, and Stephanie tells her that it is round 100 and Bob is on. Alice
sends a messages. Stephanie sends back some random junk to Alice to
convince her that there was a collision.   Alice backs off for a few
rounds. Stephanine now receives f(101), f(102), f(103), etc. and then tells
Alice that Bob has left.  Alice leaves now. Later Bob joins. Stephanine
tells him that it is round 101 and Alice is here. Bob starts talking right
away, sending three message: f(101) xor M1, f(102) xor M2, and f(103) xor
M3.   From this Stephanie is able to recover M1, M2, and M3 by xor'ing
f(101), f(102), and f(103), which she has from before, back in. Bob has
completely lost his anonymity! Thus, it looks like trusting the server for both who is on and the round
number is a bad idea! It might be possible to remove the need for a round
number if the number of seconds since channel creation is used instead, and
the clients are time synchronized. In that case running the pseudo-DC-net
on top of UDP might be preferable to running it on top of TCP. Can anyone think of an attack if the server is just trusted for a list of
who is on? If there is one, I guess new clients could ask for signed
messages of who is on: "It is 456 seconds since channel creation, and,
I---Alice---am on. (signature)". That would complicate the protocol, of
course, and cost Nancy---a new client---some time in verifying the
signatures. Good attacks so far! Keep 'em coming. :)

@_subject: Pseudo-DC-net Project 
Thank you for the comments, but I'm not sure I fully understand them all. First of all what is a TLA? Second of all, and this seems to be
something I was unclear about in my first post---I need *not* mean to
suggest that all clietns shared the same PRNG. Every pair of
clients will have their own. By star-shapped, I meant the configuration
of the communications network, not the  abstract connection that exist between cleints by virtue of the PRNG's. As for a MAC being silly,
well it would be if everyone used a different one, but I meant for
it to be shared by all participants, so that the most the MAC would reveal is that *someone* on the network sent the message.
Your paragraph that I have created a simple packet anonymizer is
probably based on the misunderstanding of the points I mentioned above.
I do like the idea of encrypting the link to the server with a PRNG,
and since I will be running lots anyway... :) (O(N) not 1 for each
client! :) ) it might be worth adding. Then again, I do not want to regard the
server as a trusted party in any way... Collision detection is easy with a MAC, so I think I will keep it.
I hadn't thought of using a ring topology... Interesting. I'll think
about that one some more.
How do hash trees help? Is that mentioned in the paper you cite? I'll
take a look at that one before long. What's the title and author?

@_subject: Active Attacks on DC-nets 
I haven't read the paper on active attacks yet, but here is an easy
example that I thought of, that others might find illuminating:
When there is a round with no messages the server sends garbage to all but one of the participants so they think collisions occured. The other participant is sent zero so that he or she thinks the channel is open. The participants who think colllisions occured are then likely to back
off for a number of rounds, so that if a message is sent it is most likely from the participant who wasn't lied to.  What do people think of the idea of clients signing all input to the
dcnet and the server signing all output and keeping logs so that it could be verified afterward (after the damage was done! :) ) whether or not
was carried out properly or not. With Schnorr signatures and precomputation
the clients could still be reasonably quick. The server will have to
do alot of work, but the signature verifications could be done in parallel
on a multiprocessor computer. Verification of the proceedings would also be
long, but it could be done off-line.

@_subject: Schelling Points, Rights, and Game Theory--Part II 
Hello, Tim,
I found your essay interesting, but would like to describe a hypothetical situation and my ideas of how your notion of Schelling points applies to you to see if I am correctly following your ideas:
Suppose that I live in a rural area and I know that my neighbour beats his children because I have seen them with bruises before and too many times just to be from household accidents. Since I am far enough away from him, the beating does not make enough noise
to distrub me from any of my activities. I am also planning on moving in three years, so there is little danger that I will be a
victim if the children develop into violent criminals due, in part,
to their abuse. In this case, the "least action" reasoning seems to tell me to do nothing. On the other hand, the state might do some sort of calculation like
the following: (probability the children will become violent criminals) x
(cost of dealing with violent criminals)
-(cost of taking the children from the parent)
to see if intervention is warranted. This is already a simple
application of utilitarianism, however, so that the introduction of the notion of Schelling points to explain state intervention seems
unnecessary. One the hand, the theory does seem distinguishable from utilitarianism for explaining the likely behaviour of the other neighbours of the beater:
Cosinder ones who will be living in the area for quite some time. They
are more likely to later become victims of violent crime (either from the
beater or the children) so would have a greater probability of intervening than others. However, it seems that no intervention can be justified on notion of Schelling points unless
(probability the children will become a violent criminal) x
(cost of children's crimes to me if they do)
-(cost of person acting now)
is positive. (Of course, people will have diffent estimates of the costs
and probability affecting whether or not they act). A utilitarian, however, would have to do the same calculation as the state to determine whether or not it was right to act, so would be more likely act,
because the utilitarian needs to consider the cost to everyone, not
just to him or herself. Am I following your ideas ok? :)

@_subject: (Another) alternative to remailer shutdowns 
Instead of having the last remailer in the chain store the plaintext of
an encrypted anonymous message, it might be more convenient to have the sender split the message into two messages and send these. The first message would contain random characters,  and the second would contain the xor of these random characters with the anonymous message. By themselves, each piece would, of course, be harmless random text, so remailer operators
greatest crime would be spamming. If the two pieces were sent through chains with different last remailers, no one operator could be held
accountable, and, of course, it would be ridiculous to suggest that
one operator could be held responsible for that fact that another
sent some random text which happened to be the xor of the random text
another had sent with a harassing message. (For instance, the
other operator could be trying to frame the first, with the
help of the receiver.) It seems to me that the only way to deal with a remailing scheme of this kind would be outlaw anonymous remalining in

@_subject: (Another) alternative to 
Yes, it would require work on the part of the receiver to put the message
back  together. This shouldn't be too difficult, though. The receiver's software
could look through all random messages of the same length and xor them together to see if something non-random popped out. Alternatively, a
"standard" format for these split messages could include the a random message ID as the last 160 bits of one part of the message and the SHA hash of this ID in the last 160 bits of the other part.
(The idea is to keep the messages looking random  for legal reasons.)
Remailer operators may want to add a note to message to the effect of
"For legal reasons, this remailer only sends random looking text. For
information on the possible usefulness of random looking text visit

@_subject: The last node in split message remail schemes 
I would like to add an extension to my proposal for split message
anonymous remailing schemes. The current proposal counts on the good will
of the senders to split their messages into random pieces. If a remailer
operator receives non-random text I can think of at least three options
for what to do:
1) The operator can drop the message. 2) The remailer operator can split the message him or herself and send    the pieces through new remailer chains.  3) Suppose there is a computer named Moe that lives on the internet,
   is hidden behind a nym, and splits messages and enters the pieces into
   remailer chains. The remailer can then encrypt the non-random text
   along with a "please forward to" command to Moe, and  send the ciphertext
   anonymously to Moe. (Due to the encryption there is no need to split
   this message.)
The risk, in ascending terms of legal danger, for the operator would
be 1), 3), and 2). Nevertheless, all three alternatives should be safe within a secure (in the sense of Chaum, 1981) remailer network.

@_subject: LInteger Version 0.1: A C++ MPILIB 
LInteger is a C++ library designed to allow programmers to create and
perform arithmetic on objects representing nearly arbitrary precision
integers.  Thanks to C++'s support for operator overloading, the use of the
large integers in this library should be nearly as easy as the use of
regular int's. In fact, much code which performs arithmetic on regular
int's can be converted to code to perform the same arithmetic on arbitrary
precision integers merely by substituting "LInteger" for "int". This library is free for both commercial and non-commercial use. (See the
COPYRIGHT notice included in the source distribution for exact details.)
The current version of this library is only implemented for i386+
processors, and will, probably, only compile unhacked under gcc.
Additionally, it has only been tested on the Linux operating system, though
I am fairly confident that it will compile, unhacked, under the OS/2 and
Windows versions of gcc. (Please let me know if you get it to work!)
The basic multiprecision methods are implemented in i386+ assembly language
for high speed. Multiplication is performed recursively resulting in O(lg 3) performance. Modular multiplication can be performed via Montgomery
representations for a noticeable performance gain when a large number of
these modular multiplications are performed.  HTML documentaion for all public methods is included.
There is currently no pseudo-random or probable prime number generation
included. These are my highest priorities for the next release which will, hopefully, come out shortly after I read Rabin-Miller. :) A link to the latest version of this library can be found at

LInteger is a set of C++ libraries supporting multiple precision integers.
Also included are libraries supporting chain hash functions and
pseudo-random number generators.
The core multiple precision methods are coded in i386+ assembly language
for high speed. The libraries will only compile under GNU's g++ compiler,
and have only been tested under the Linux and Windows NT operating systems.
It is anticipated that there should not be any problems compiling under
Windows '95, however, and that compiling for OS/2 will only require minor
hacking, if any.
Included as a sample chain hash function is an i386+ assembly
implementation of the Secure Hash Algorithm (FIPS 180-1).  Included as a
sample pseudo-random number generator is an implementation of a
pseudo-random number generator described in Section 3.1 of FIPS 186 (the
Digital Signature Standard).
Complete HTML documentation is provided for all public and protected
methods.  The package is free for both commercial and non-commercial use.
Some of the improvements of this release over version 0.1 include:
 - Pseudo-random number generation.  - Probable prime generation.  - Easier constructors.  - MontyRep and ResidueClass classes.  - ASCII I/O in bases 1 to 36.  - Overloading of fstreams operators for storage on persistent media.  - Easier exponentiation.  - Pentium optimizations for multiplication and squaring.  - A square root function (by special request).  - 8+3 filenames (by special request).  - Various bug fixes and speed improvements (and some slowdowns! :) ) The package is available for download at

@_subject: Recommendation: Creation of "alt.cypherpunks" 
I think that the statement of our desire to create a new group
should clearly indicate that the discussion
group is of a special nature due to the tight integration of
technical and political discussions. Cypherpunks are trying to achieve political goals through technological means, so it is difficult, and
not regarded as desirable to produce a false dichotomy for discussions. As an example, we could cite the Linux newsgroups like comp.os.linux.misc. Linux is a piece of software written
to help achieve a political goal, and, thus, in the Linux groups
it is not considered off-topic to philosophize about
these goals or the future as and after Linux knocks Microsoft out of
the market. :)
talk.politics.crypto and sci.crypt can, then, easily be argued against since the discussions there are much more restricted than what we desire.
Given that you have been on the list a great deal longer than
I, I do respect that you may have deeper insights into the
mind of the "perverse personality" than I do. I, however, am
not aware of evidence that the person or persons behind the
disruptions since the middle of last year would try to interrupt
a democratic USENET creation vote. My recollection of the
history is that the initial attacks were directed at you personally.
Dr. Vulis was blamed for them and thus, apparently, became
the target of nasty e-mailings to his site. He responded to
this by spamming the list with rather large articles
on Armenian war crimes and forwardings of the messages. At that point Gilmore booted Vulis.
Gilmore then became a target of attack and, it seems
that many (presumably) innocent bystanders were unwittingly
subscribed to the list in an effort to cause more
work, and, hence, annoyance to Gilmore when they complained
about the unwanted mail. At this point many new personalities
seemed to materialize out of nowhere bent on doing
nothing more than fueling flame wars. Then the "moderation experiment" (fiasco)... I do not see in this evidence, however, that
any of the disruptors would target the process of the
creating a new group USENET group. At first, the
the disruptor could easily have rationalized that anonymous, personal
attacks were fair play, since anarachists favour no explicit rules
with regards to speech. After Vulis was removed by Gilmore
the disruptor could then rationalize that "anything goes" since
list had then passed from a state of anarchy to one with
Gilmore trying to decide who could or not be on the list.
(I do not think that these conjectued rationalizations are valid
myself, but am just trying to give an my thoughts on the
psychology of the "perverse personality".)
USENET nesgroup creation is whole new ball game, however.
There are explicitly defined rules and the process
is intended to be democratic. If my guess as to the identity of the person masterminding the  attacks is correct, that person seems to have
democratic sympathies or, at least, be strongly opposed to even
hints of censorship, so I do not think he would attempt
to disrupt the process of deciding if a new group
is created or not since that would both be inferring
in a democratic process and an attempt to prevent
a group of people from creating a discussion group, and thus, himself,
becoming a censor.  (This makes me think that given that the process is intended to be democratic, it may be more fitting that
a more anarchisticly method is used to create
an "alt.*" group for cyphepunks than the democratic one
used to create a "comp.*" one.)
In any case, if you have deeper insights than mine into the mind of
the disruptor, or evidence that he or she or them would
try to disrupt a comp.* newsgroup creation proces, I
would be eager to hear them.

Yuck! I got a "bad signature" warning when checking the signature. The sha1
hash of what I downloaded is
