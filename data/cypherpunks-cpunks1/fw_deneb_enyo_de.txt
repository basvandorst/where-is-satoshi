As far as I know, these news stories can be tracked back to a
particular USA Today story.  There's also been a bunch of stories how
a covert channel in TCP could be used by terrorists to hide their
Unfortunately, when such stories are retold for the second time, the
"could be used" part tends to change to "is used". 8-(

However, they use some form of crypto.  From a recent press release of
our attorney general:
(Very rough translation: "The persons are accused of being members of
"Ansar al Islam" and planning the assassination of the Iraqi prime
minister during his visit to Germany on the 2nd and 3rd December,
2004.  This follows from the contents of a multitude of encrypted
telephone calls the accussed exchanged since November 28, 2004.")
Probably, they just used code words, and no "real" cryptography.  I'm
trying to obtain a confirmation, though.

* R. A. Hettinga:
AOL appears to allow you to disable PassCode for your account, so this
is only of limited usability against phishing scams.  AOL even fails
to stress that you must never enter the PassCode serial number during
the normal login process. 8-(

Thanks for the pointer.
In addition, there's no trace of the second-preimage attack some
persons recently alluded to.

* Ian G.:
from your AOL PassCode.
I think you can forward the PassCode to AOL once the victim has
entered it on a phishing site.  Tokens ` la SecurID can only help if
the phishing schemes *require* delayed exploitation of obtained
credentials, and I don't think we should make this assumption.  Online
MITM attacks are not prevented.
(Traditional IPsec XAUTHis problematic for the very same reason, even
with a SecurID token lookalike.)

* James A. Donald:
Keep in mind that one party runs the required software on a computed

effectiveness of zero-knowledge proofs into question.

* Peter Fairbrother:
Well, if Mr Gates is a witness and not a suspect, such coercive
measures are well within the legal framework of most countries.  As a
witness, you must testify.  It simply does not matter if the
information you are asked to provide is encrypted, or is stored in a
database and needs significant preprocessing to obtain.  It would be
quite surprising if this was any different in the UK.
So it's purely the self-incrimination part that is questionable from a
legal POV.  I think this bears repeating because we face a similar
discussion in Germany regarding covert data seizure using
technological measures, and the discussion focuses almost entirely on
the technological measures.  But the legal obstacle is just the

* R. A. Hettinga:
I don't think this hasn't got to do much with Antigua.  It's also not
specific to North America.  It's very difficult to create market
conditions which result in low-latency routing, so only smaller
countries with a sufficently developed Internet economy have it.
(The U.S. issues in this area are so bad that even a network with
extensive peering hasn't got drastically better connectivity to major
U.S. sites than a consumer DSL line in some European countries.)
