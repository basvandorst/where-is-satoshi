@_subject: A question from Seattle 
hey,  I'm a 28 year old living in Seattle and I've been having quite the
fantasy of watching and or participating in father/son activities...or big
brother and little brother interaction.  Do you have any suggestions
where/who I might contact in the Seattle metro area?
