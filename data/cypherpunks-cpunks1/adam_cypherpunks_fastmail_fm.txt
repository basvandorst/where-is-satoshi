First of all, there were 19 children killed in the OKC bombing. Were
these children guilty of some crime worthy of being killed by a truck
Second of all, you make it sound like McVeigh was just your average-Joe
American. How could a non-fundamentalist knowingly kill 168 people? Third, does not being a suicide bomber make your cause more noble?
Curious why you seem to think McVeigh was justified in his actions. On Sat, 16 Oct 2004 16:01:47 -0700, "James A. Donald"

I am curious, Mr. Donald, how exactly you define the word "terrorist". I
request that your definition be generic; i.e. not a definition like
"anyone who attacks the US".
I'd be willing to bet that you cannot provide a clear generic definition
of "terrorist". Moreover, I can guarantee that you cannot provide a
definition that isn't self-contradictory.

The problem is, of course, that the US simply cannot keep their dicks
out of the affairs of other countries. We are obsessed with controlling
how the world develops, so as to guarantee to force countries to evolve
in such a way that is beneficial to the US. Such is an inevitable hazard
of becoming the last remaining super-power; we know we can control the
world, and have now (with the declaration of war in Iraq) let the world
know that there's nothing anyone can do about it. The US wants the world to operate like a giant corporation run by old
white fudge-packers who smile on TV and fuck us all behind closed doors.
Terrorism, as you say, is the response of other countries who violently
resent American involvement in affairs that, at their core, have nothing
to do with the US. Unfortunately, the US's "war on terror" completely
misses this point, and only serves to further the problem. Sure, we might kill a few existing "terrorists", but where do
"terrorists" come from? Won't these actions create a larger and more
hostile breeding ground for more people to lash out at US involvement in
foreign affairs? The US government just doesn't understand, or just
doesn't care.

This brings up thoughts of prior debates on whether or not US citizens
are subject to the International Court. We (the US) are making a habit
of forcing our laws on other countries, but yet we are not subject to
the laws of an established INTERNATIONAL court; one who's laws are
created from a consensus of people of many nations and backgrounds. The
hypocrisy of the "Bush Doctrine" is simply mind-boggling.

You know, the more I read posts by Mr. Donald, the more I believe that
he is quite possibly the most apt troll I have ever encountered. It is
quite apparent from reading his responses that he is obviously an
exceptionally intelligent (academically anyway) individual. I find it
hard to believe that such intelligence could reside in a person with
such critically flawed core beliefs. I have a hunch that Mr. Donald is instead playing the role of an
elaborate "devil's advocate", furiously defending his stance against
retaliations by our fellow Cypherpunks. Tyler Durden mentioned this
hypothesis many emails ago, and I believe him to be accurate, especially
since Mr. Donald never responded to the charge.
None-the-less, this has been one of the more inteteresting (and
infuriating) threads in recent memory of Cypherpunks. I'm glad we're
going through it with such vigor.
