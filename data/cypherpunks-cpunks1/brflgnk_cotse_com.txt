@_subject: CDR: Yet another key maintainence infrastructure? 
I ran across a (new?) company, Authentica, that's fielding a security model for email, web pages and documents.  The mail product, MailRecall, uses a plugin that fetches a key lease for each received message and restricts access based on the properties of the lease.
Their website,  has little to no real information about the actual crypto or key protocols used.  Anyone heard about this?  Thoughts on its usefulness?
On a similar note, I had run across  a few weeks ago and actually sent email asking what they were using to protect stored documents.  The website was pretty vague, and the response was about the same.  The flack blathered on about not sharing that information outside their NDA'd "Trusted Partners", though he assured me they used "industry standard"

Quoting Greg Broiles :
I have to agree, and wasn't intending to promote their proliferation.
This is an essential problem, I think.  Self-decryptors are easy for Joseph Q. Sixpack, but train him to trust executable attachments in general.  Which implies that such people will be denied crypto's benefits entirely.  Perhaps this is evolution in action?

If the citizens of Missouri chose to elect a deceased person as Senator, I think that's exactly what they should get.  Leave the seat empty for two years.

Tim asked where John Young might be, in considering Jim Bell's predicament.  I notice that nothing new has been posted to Cryptome since Nov. 4.
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

@_subject: CDR: Cypherus, new encryption suite 
I saw in one of the tech email newsrags that F. Lee Bailey was at Comdex
promoting a package called Cypherus.  Their website,
 is a little light on details.  It only mentions
that Cypherus uses Blowfish with up to 448-bit keys.  There's some blather
about a "Key Manager" and self-decrypting envelopes, but nothing about
asymetrical crypto.
No evaluation version that I could find.  They claim they'll be shipping in
Dec.  Anyone heard anything at all about Cypherus?

Quoting Joe Baptista :
Actually, that wasn't a question.  It's also the same John Palmer who mined UUCP maps and spammed paper junk mail to several thousand sysadmins offering the services of his Rabbit Network (whose logo Kibo once described as the ugliest in history).  He was often described as Usenet's Best Bad Example, and was semi-immortalized with his own alt.fan newsgroup.
I remember when he first started pushing alternative TLDs and urging people to use "sane" DNS that recognized them.  At the time, I dismissed it as more of Mr. Palmer's wackiness.  Little did I know that ICANN would rise up as it has, nor did I predict the Open Root Server Project.  As I said, age brings wisdom (for all, it seems).  You are correct that John Palmer is on the right track.  I wish him success in his endeavour.

@_subject: CDR: FBI "rejects" student profiling 
Of interest:  though the unnamed spokesman asserted that the FBI is opposed to profiling students to detect potential school violence, the article still includes a laundry list of "warning signs": "The FBI provided a list of clues to look for after a student has made a violent threat."
"Unsupervised" computer and Internet access is mentioned twice.
Soon to come:  "We cannot be so fixated on the right to free access to information..."  For the chiiilldren, of course!

The Amex disposable number story reminds me to ask: has anyone on the list actually used their Blue card and reader to make a secure purchase over the web? Know anyone who has? (I'm almost tempted to apply for one just to get the free smart card reader, so I can hack on it)
