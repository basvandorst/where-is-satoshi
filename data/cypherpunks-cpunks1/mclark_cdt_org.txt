You may want to look into the Publius Censorship Resistant Publishing System.  This is a beta system currently, so is only a short term solution. But you could post a file to Publius, send the resulting URL out to cypherpunks and other lists, and then anyone could get a copy of the file anonymously. Michael

Unfortunately within only a few hours of having the information posted online, I was told that the fact sheet and the amendments were already out of date, so I should remove the information. I hope to have new information Friday morning, which is an eternity I realize. I'll post it as soon as I get it.  Michael
