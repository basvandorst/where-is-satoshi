The religious person is always battling against reality wich with a minimum of inteligence from the observer always bring doubts on the truth of his It's a state of mind wich  can only be compared with mental ilness...
(I've read that there are even some neurological similarities between the faithful and the mentaly ill)
The author of that statement: "I have no need of that hipotheses" was Laplace, french mathematician on answering Napoleon's question in why is book on newtonian mechanics didn't call for god.

@_subject: Anyone heard about the Berkeley college student? 
News in a country where newspapers full of the following headlines are published are not to be taken by face value:
- The eiffel tower was buit by a chinese
- Edison stole the electric light from a chinese
blah, blah, blah...
A friend of mine (who is married to a singapurean and speaks fluent mandarin and cantonese) when in her first trip to china, found these newspapers with this prepostorous claims. She bought several of them to shown to her In the chinese customs she had them confiscated...
Cultural propaganda against western values and achievements.

@_subject: Looting of museums, banks, shops, factories--South Central  
Nah!!!! Just pure old fashioned incompetence...
Running all the way for "Bagdad" Rumsfeld on sleep inibition drugs takes it's Take for example this small news:
A group of looters tried to loot a small shop. The shopkeeper's son armed with a kalachnikov made them run away.
What they did next? Well, went to a platoon of marines and told they knew where was a a Fedahin Militia with a Kalachnikov...
The kid was shot with automatic weapon fire at sight without even been questioned or the information confirmed.
The marines are so tired that they don't even think right...
(Just being cynical, people..)
Now that they are at target, they just want a good night's sleep... No time for civilian patrol...
But you could be right. But it also seems to me that this is the perfect oportunity to ramsack the ministries of all information, dossiers and contacts related to terrorism and arab nations and still leave the doubt to those people that all your references in the iraqui system were lost and out of american hands, during the ministry and public fires...
Creating doubt to the ennemy in an inteligence operation sometimes gives you the edge you need to achieve your goals...

@_subject: The Plague 
And all westerns have some level of aquired imunity, for we are the descendents of the plague survivors. (Actualy, in the dark ages, it wasn't only one plague.. it was several plagues (mutants and new pathogens) that spread wavelike through europe... the populations died mainly because of sistematically reduced imunity)
