i am determined
a few months in the life of this infertile girl
Taking the valentines happy girl

i think they are so cute i love her litte handwriting and she is beyond excited to pass them out some other projects she and i looked at but didnt get around to (of course) from martha (of course)
but i couldnt stop looking at the picture because it shows the place where i played for the first 12 years of my life and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penny and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me we lived on a corner in a typical oc tract neighborhood cate did you love disney games on the computer when you were five
