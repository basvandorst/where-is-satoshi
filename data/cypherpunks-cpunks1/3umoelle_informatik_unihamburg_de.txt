@_subject: Liberal party: definitely no crypto ban in Germany 
Germany's liberal party FDP, which forms the government together with
the larger Christian Democrats (CDU), has announced that they will
not accept any restrictions to the use of cryptography.
Yesterday the German Bundestag began to debate the draft Information
and Communication Services Law (see
 for
information about that draft).
Both Minister of Justice Schmidt-Jortzig and FDP research politics
speaker Laermann said that cryptography must not be banned.  Laermann
said the FDP will definitely not accept any crypto law that restricts
or bans using cryptography.  "I say this in the knowledge that what is
desired herewith firstly is technically impossible, and secondly it
cannot be allowed to give up protection of private, economic and - I
say this from personal first hand, I may say bitter experience -
scientific data from unauthorized, unfair and even criminal doings.
The FDP will not allow that."
The FDP supports the draft Digital Signature Law, but will resist any
attempts to abuse the security infrascture as an entry into crypto
Until recently, the FDP position on cryptography has been indifferent.
Early this year FDP politicians have begun to verbosely contradict
those in the CDU that want to restrict cryptography.  In March,
Minister of Justice Schmidt-Jortzig said at a North German FDP
convention: "Currently there exist demands to ban cryptography or to
deposit all keys with a central authority that can then arbitrarily
decrypt messages.  Those demands are deeply illiberal."  The
convention passed a resolution saying that "Nobody may restrict the
citicens' right to use encryption to protect their data from
unauthorized access by third parties."
The Bundestag vice president Burkhard Hirsch published a statement on
the FDP web server, saying that banning cryptography clearly is
pointless, and precisely for that reason not even the Third Reich or
East Germany had tried to do so.  In a letter to the newsmagazine
 "You could laugh your head off, if you didn't know
that they really mean it."

   We also endorse the use of technology to give privacy protection. For

   PICS technology is being adapted to screen out Web sites that do not
   adhere to a specified level of privacy protection. Another example is
   the "anonymizer," which assigns an anonymous identity to a user and
   allows the user to shield personal information from Web sites that he

A European parliament study evaluating `Feasibility of censoring and

"SUBSCRIBER PROTECTION: In this scenario [...] it would be necessary
for access providers to use firewall and PICS technology (in some
instances implemented with in proxy applications) to implement a
management regime consistent with provisions for protection of society
as in other media, ie media parity. Implementation on this basis would
be necessary to ensure subscribers could not tamper with management
settings. The impact of implementing the necessary technology on the
operating economics of access providers appears to be small. That
technologies of these types have already been employed by access
provider organisations [...] could potentially be considered to
confirm this."

This is a gross exaggeration.  "Pattern investigation" can be used to
investigate certain severe crimes that cannot be solved otherwise.  It
must be warranted by a judge, naming the patterns that the respective
committer is believed to match.  There have been three "pattern
investigations" ever, since the law was passed in 1991 (none of them
At least one German law professor argues that GAK is no problem if the
escrow agents are regularly inspected by the Privacy Commissioner.
The Privacy Commissioners on the other hand say that a crypto
regulation would be unconstitutional.
I agree that the existence of privacy officials will not prevent GAK.
But the constitutional protection of privacy should.  The German
privacy regulation is based on a decision of the Constitutional Court
which states that the citizen must be protected from an omniscient
state, and from omniscient business.  This decision clearly makes the
scenario you described above illegal.
The government draft of the Information and Communication Services Law
specifies that service providers "shall make it possible for the user
to use teleservices and to pay for them either anonymously or using a
pseudonym, insofar as this is technically possible and can be
reasonably expected".
The Bundesrat (Upper House) disagrees: "Users [...] can also be
information providers that e.g. post information to the Internet.
If these have a legal claim to use the service anonymously, they
will in future be able to commit crimes without having to fear to
be identified."
Others warn that failing to let the market decide will lead to
misinvestments, and that anonymous services will quickly be deployed
on a voluntary basis if there is a demand.
It's probably obvious which of these are right.  Nevertheless, I think
it is encouraging that the government accepts that anonymity has a
value. (They will never learn that sometimes it is better not to make
a law.)

You may remember RISKS-19.09, in which I discussed the risks in a
network-wide attack on the RSA DES challenge: The Swedish group at
 didn't give out its source, so the client
could, in fact, do anything, such as crack a master EC-card key.  The reason
given was client integrity.
Well, a month after this, the promised source code release has not happened.
Instead, it appears that somebody disassembled part of the client, made a
version that reported fake "done" blocks, and then sent these to the
Moral?  Don't ever think that nobody can read compiled code.  Don't try to
run a cooperative effort like this in a closed development model.

Wrong. One trusted mix is enough to guarantee anonymity: There is a

messages going out in random order.  (Consult the archives for

dummy messages, and how to detect/prevent them.)

Remailer operators share the belief that it must be possible to use

It is not just about Denmark. The Wassenaar arrangement has been
signed by 33 countries, including the US, Canada, the European Union,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and others. Up to now, 30 of
these states have allowed to export mass market and public domain
crypto software without a license. Only the US, France and NZ did not
have the "General Software Note".
The US has exercised extreme pressure at the Wassenaar conference (as
one German government official writes) and has managed to get the
General Software Note modified. Now the states that have signed the
arrangement will have to regulate the export of strong
cryptography. There are other places such as Brazil, Iceland, South
Africa, India, and even Singapore which do not have any export
restrictions. However, must crypto software that is distributed on the
Internet right now is distributed under General Software Note.
 "I call for volunteers in each country, at each
university or crypto-aware organization, to download crypto tools
while they can still be exported from where they are, and then to
