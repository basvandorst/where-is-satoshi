In that case, you wouldn't have to send your key to that person---they

The Internet is based on _suggested_ standards such as RFC2015 (note
its disposition---it's not an official standard).  No one is forced to
comply with them, and those who wish to communicate effectively do
their best to use their software in such a way as to be able to do so.
It is obvious that you have no wish for the majority of people to be
able to read your mail, as you refuse to acknowledge that your

RFC2015, saying "look, I'm following the standard.  I must be right."
The fact is, there's no "right."  It comes down to what you're trying
to accomplish.  If you're interested in pissing people off and being
ignored, then you're doing OK.  Otherwise, you might consider backing
down on this one.  The only thing you're going to acheive is an

criticizing the policies of the government or some government body.
If I say "the FBI is a corrupt bunch of slimeball fucktowels," I

of a body of the government which are not necessarily based on the

Nitpick if you will; you and I both know what the statement means,

"NP-hard ... a complexity class of problems that are intrinsically
harder than those that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing
machine in polynomial time" (Algorithms and Theory of Computation
Handbook, 19--20).
While I agree that the limitations of current techniques do not
dictate what is possible, it _is_ possible to show that a certain
problem has a best-case order of growth (for something simple, think
of gate-level addition; its best case is provably Theta(log(N)) ).
In this case, what Tim means is that work is being done towards
showing that the best-case order of growth for factorization is faster
than polynomial, hence it is NP-hard.

If you're talking about the carries actually falling through full
adders, there is a method called carry lookahead that computes carries
in a tree (with branching factor 2).  Computing the sum bits from the
carries is a constant time independent of the number of bits in the
adder, so the process is overall Theta(log(N)).
On the other hand, if you're talking about speed of propagation
through traces, you're right for large gate size.  However, as gates
get smaller, the speed of propagation becomes less important, and the
adder speed asymptotically approaches Theta(log(N)).

The fact that it's not the insuree's fault does _not_ mean that it's
the insurer's fault.  Said another way, the insurance company has no
additional responsibility to (WLOG) me because I have a genetic
defect.  However, you're proposing that the insurance company endeavor
to waste money on those who are known to be "losers" as far as
insurance goes.  You as a smoker should be the most outraged in such a
situation; the strict standards that keep you from getting insurance
at a good rate do not apply to me because my elevated risk for
e.g. heart disease has a different source.
It's not the cause of the risk that concerns the insurance companies,
it's the existance of the risk.  That's all they need judge upon, and
any interference by the government saying otherwise is an unreasonable
burden on private enterprise.
"It won't hurt them _that_much_ to lose a little money on these
people; thus, they should be forced to do so."  Preposterous.
Still not the insurance company's fault.  They're not there to save my
sorry, genetically defective ass, they're there to make money.
Right.  And if they're forced to insure people who are money sinks for
them, everyone's rates go up, because the total amount of risk the
insurance company takes (expressed as the amount of money they pay out
as claims) plus their profit must equal the amount of money they make
on premiums.

How so?  In most cases, the genetic defects that we're discussing are
not those that produce three heads and a heart the size of a
watermelon; insurance companies don't need any tests to know they're
not insuring such a person.  The things we're concerned with are
conditions such as a familial tendency towards heart disease or a
possibility of developing diabetes later in life.  For the most part,
they're not things that prevent people from holding jobs and having
I see a possibility for the equivalent of high-risk vehicular
insurance for people who have genetic defects as genetic testing for
insurance purposes becomes more common.  Just as some companies
specialize in insuring those who have showed themselves to have shitty
driving records, health insurance companies who have high-rate,
high-risk policies will become more common.  Sure, it'll be more
expensive for people who have serious genetic problems to get
coverage, but it's certainly the case that it's more expensive to
provide _care_, so the expense is not unjust.
In light of this, my question is the following: Why do you believe that those who are born with genetic problems have
additional entitlements that the rest of us don't have?
Alternatively, attempt to justify placing the burden for healthcare of
a particular person with genetic defects on any of the following:
(a) that person
(b) insurance companies
(c) taxpayers
Even if it is the case that preventative care would be cheaper, then
it's just stupidity on the part of the insurance company not to invest
this way; this does not justify government intervention ("You're not
running your business right; let us help!" would sound strange coming
from the U.S. government, anyway).
However, I reject that it is the case that additional preventative
care would do anything.  Currently, most insurance companies I know of
will pay for flu shots and things along those lines.  What else do you
want?  We could cover your arm in a cast so that it doesn't get
broken, but I'm not sure if you'd really like that.
I can't produce any hard figures on frivolous hospital visits, but my
feeling (having lived in a family of medical people) is that any
additional preventative care that the insurance companies attempted to
provide would only end up encouraging hypochondriacs to go to their
doctor or hospital on the slightest whim.

This is, predictably, the difference between your position and those
of the people with whom you have been arguing.  As far as I'm
concerned (and I know many agree with me), government should not have
anything to do with the provision of health care for its people; it
simply exists to make sure the rules of the private market are
followed, contracts are honored, a military exists to protect the
people (and their ability to do business, etc) from foreign powers,
etc.  Compelling private business to be charitable doesn't fall within
what I consider to be acceptable powers of the government.
This is not discrimination; it is exactly the opposite.  The insurance
company has a standard of risk they are willing to take when they
enter into a contract with a policy holder.  This standard is applied
in the same way to everyone.  I know I've given this example in the past, but here it is again: if
you are a smoker and have three times the chance of developing heart
disease, the insurance company will not insure you.  If I have a
genetic defect that causes me to have three times the chance of
developing heart disease, they won't insure me.  In both cases, the
reason that they don't offer a policy is because we have elevated
risks of heart disease; they don't care that you smoke and I have a
genetic disorder--this fact makes no difference to the success or
failure of their business.  The insurance company plays a game of probable ends, not of means; the
cause of my heart's likelihood of failure is of no consequence to how
much risk the insurance company is taking on me, so it shouldn't be a
factor in deciding whether or not to insure me.  In fact, if it
becomes a factor, the insurance company is no longer able to
effectively control their risk, and thus they are not longer effective
in their real purpose--making money.
If it sounds heartless to say that they're making money, then you just
have your head buried in the sand.  Everyone's out to make money.  If
you expect anything else, you will be sorely disappointed, and if you
try to use force to make companies compassionate, you are perpetrating
a greater injustice than you could ever hope to prevent.
My biggest problem with your argument is that nowhere in it is there
any need for the group bearing the burden to be the insurance
companies.  That is, you say that 'people should have health care,' and
you say that 'insurance companies have a lot of money.'  You conclude
that insurance companies should provide for the care of those who are
at high risks for certain types of illnesses or who can't afford a
policy that will cover them at their risk level.  It would be just as
easy to say 'lawyers have a lot of money,' combine this with the first
statement above, and conclude that lawyers should pay for the
health care of people who are at high risk, although I don't support
this claim either.
In fact, what you're arguing for can be generalized with no
modification of your argument to 'those who are successful should be
made responsible for the care of those who are not.'  I wholeheartedly
reject this claim and all like it; people have a right to decide how
they spend their money no matter how much they have managed to acquire.

Thus, petro is correct; the government is taking positive action

me unhappy.  The other way, of course you can argue that the person
not getting health care is unhappy, but that is through a lack of

You should read up on Type 1 and Type 2 remailers.  Both involve
encryption.  In the case of Type 2 remailers, you only need to trust
one in the chain that you use in order to be sure that your identity
is securely hidden.
Wrong again.  By default in versions of sendmail since 4.9, all sent
mails are logged right along with the failures--and this includes the
IP address from which the connection was made to the SMTP server.
Simply setting your SMTP server is not nearly enough.  If 'they' have
the IP address from which the mail was sent, 'they' have you.  As I
said above, please read up on Type 1 and Type 2 remailers before
making such outrageous claims.
Finding open relays that don't do logging is difficult at best.
As I said above, in the case of the Type 2 remailer, you only have to
trust one server in the chain, and presumably you can find one that
you're likely to trust not to disclose information to the people from
whom you want to hide your identity.  In the case of a US national,
for example, post through a remailer in a country that the US doesn't
like much--there are plenty of those--and you're fine.  That, or trust
that, for example, the MIT LCS remailer is reasonably secure (and it
is--I know the person who runs it), and make sure it's in your chain.
Again, I ask you to produce an example of an open relay that you are
reasonably sure does not do logging.

@_subject: MIT Declines to review Carnivore 
This story is actually fairly old, but it's just now available in
electronic form (I didn't want to type it up!) and it's still a
relevant piece of news.
Institute Declines Offer to Evaluate FBI Electronic Surveillance Program
MIT has informally declined to review Carnivore, the FBI's e-mail
surveillance system.
The Department of Justice had approached MIT to do a "technical
evaluation" of the system, but MIT technicians and administrators
decided that it would not be appropriate for the Institute to
undertake the review.
The impetus for an independent review came in response to pressure
from civil liberties groups: the DOJ is seeking an impartial third
party to assuage fears that Carnivore is infringing privacy rights.
MIT researchers, including Information Systems Network Manager Jeff
Schiller and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
Ronald L. Rivest, said that while the review was important, they
declined to review Carnivore based on two main concerns. First, the
government set unreasonable guidelines for the way the review was to
be carried out, and second, there was a lack of interest among MIT
personnel, probably due to problematic government restrictions and
time commitments.
Schiller said that the DOJ did not really want an independent review
at all. Instead, it wanted to "borrow our reputation" and allow the
FBI to say to the public, "`If you don't trust us, trust MIT.'"
Those involved agreed that as a research university, MIT cannot
publish a report without releasing all of the data that it used in
conducting the evaluation. Due to security issues, it would be up to
the FBI to decide what information to release.
In addition, Schiller was concerned with the government's power to
edit the report before releasing it to the public.
The internal MIT discussion as to whether to accept the DOJ's bid
included Schiller and high-level EECS professors Hal Abelson
Ph.D. '73, Jerome H. Saltzer, and M. Frans Kaashoek, as well as
Laboratory for Computer Science head Michael L. Dertouzos.
Schiller and Abelson said that the general consensus among those
involved in discussions was that the DOJ had set an improbable
deadline on the project, and that there were too many problems
inherent in the DOJ's proposal.
Abelson said that the government's concerns are valid, but given the
constraints the DOJ has imposed, "it shouldn't hope for an independent
DOJ says restrictions are fair
DOJ Chief Science and Technical Officer Donald Prosnitz and Associate
Attorney General for Administration Stephen R. Colgate said that they
"understood the concerns of the universities." Along with the
Institute, Purdue University, Dartmouth College, University of
Michigan, and the Supercomputing Centre at the University of
California have all turned down bids extended by the DOJ, according to
published reports.
Prosnitz said, however, that there are actually "very few limits"
placed on the contractor that is to review Carnivore. He contended
that the only restrictions imposed by the government are standard
security procedures such as background checks of personnel involved in
the project. In addition, the source code for Carnivore will remain
confidential, Prosnitz said. The contractor has access to everything
else it needs, he said.
Prosnitz explained that the reason for the close deadline of December
1 is that the DOJ wants to have the report done during Attorney
General Janet Reno's tenure, so that she will have time to consider
the case. In addition, the DOJ hopes to have Congress vote on it in
their next session. The present administration will step down on
January 20, 2000, but Prosnitz said that he has total confidence that
the transition of government will not in any way affect the system's
The government is currently in negotiations with a possible
contractor. The unnamed contractor has said that it will finish the
project on schedule, Prosnitz said.
Schiller questions review
While Schiller said that an independent review is important, he said
that he has no doubt that the system will work the way it is supposed
to work. A more important question, he said, is whether or not the FBI
would abide by what the court order allows it legally to do.
Schiller suggested that a third party, most probably a user's Internet
service provider, be responsible for gathering evidence, and then
turning it over to the FBI.
Prosnitz and Colgate stated that it was actually their preference to
have the ISP gather and turn over evidence in the form of
e-mail. Carnivore is only used in cases when a small ISP does not have
the capabilities of giving the FBI what the court orders demand, he
said. Prosnitz added that Carnivore has been used less than 25 times
since its creation.

Not at all.  The distinction is in the same vein as the distinction
between talking about something and actually doing it.
You can't draw this parallel, though.  You see, he is only proposing
the _lack_ of certain forces compelling you to do something.  This is
not advocating "anarchy, injustice, and immorality," but simply
rejecting regulations on how one should associate with the rest of
Further, setting a precedent whereby it is acceptable to legislate
"proper behavior" is obviously flawed, because you can't provide a
valid distinction between nice fuzzy laws compelling you to behave in
a certain way and the laws of an Orwellian nightmare as you'd
certainly like to.  On the other hand, making a distinction between
laws that compel behavior of one sort and laws that simply prevent
certain behaviors is perfectly acceptable, and necessary.  The
argument is really, I think, about laws which limit positive actions
(shooting someone) versus laws which limit negative actions (not
associating with someone).  The latter are, for Gil, for me, and for
most people on this list, unacceptable.
Please admit that you just used a squirrel definition so we can kill
the worms in this can quickly.  Restrictions on the negative liberty
in question (that is, _not_ to associate with someone) are obviously
more intrusive than laws that limit positive liberties (e.g. the
liberty to kill your neighbor).
This statement tells me that there is no common ground between you and
Gil, or between you and me.  Gil and I start from the assumption that
you have liberties that the government cannot take away, while you
seem to be coming from the perspective that the government gives its
people certain liberties, but that liberty comes from nowhere else but
government.  Perhaps it's not even worth it to argue any more.
I put forth this explanation: shared resources are those resources to
which it is impossible to restrict access.  A lighthouse built on the
coast and the radio spectrum are both examples of shared resources.
Food is not.  I can keep you from eating my food without too much
trouble--I can lock it in a safe or I can eat it.  I can discriminate
as to whom I will provide services, et cetera.
No, not at all.  A shopkeeper who owns a private shop has the right to
sell only to certain people and not to others, and the distinction the
shop owner makes between those he will sell to and those he will not
is his alone to make.
But why not?  Why is this different from forcing a shop owner to sell
to people he would not otherwise serve?  It seems that if I cannot
limit your right to speak, even if I can't escape the sound of your
voice, you can't limit my right not to sell food to you even if it
means you will starve.
Neither Gil nor anyone else is your caretaker; thus, you are imposing
upon him by asking him to transport you out of there.  This is again a
distinction between positive and negative action.  You say his
_in_action is an undue burden on you.  I say that your request for his
action is an undue burden on him.
You have a right to life.  You do not have the right not to die.
There is a difference.  Neither I nor anyone else have to sustain your
life; all that is required of our respecting your right not to die is
that we don't kill you.

There's a difference, though.  There cannot be any law saying that two
dykes can't kiss in a ball park, but neither can there be a law saying
that a private organization has to accept it in their place of
business.  The ball park may seem a borderline case, but clearly the
baseball association and that particular ball park are both private
organizations; thus they have the right to do as they please.  This is
not to say that doing so is strictly politic, but that's for them to
worry about.
Right, but neither is it the government's business what the ball park

Wrong.  I don't have to justify throwing you off of land that I own.
When I buy a ticket to a ballgame it is subject to the owner letting
me in the ballpark.  I understand that when I buy the ticket, I take a
risk in doing so; the owner can decide he doesn't want me on his
property and throw me out.  The fact that I bought a ticket doesn't
assure me that I'll be allowed to stay in the ballpark, it only
assures me that I won't be turned away at the door.  The owner can
still decide to throw me out at any time.
Because in the owner's eyes this won't be acceptable to the majority
of the fans at the game.  I personally say let them do whatever they
want, but if there's some tightass bible banger sitting next to the
two lesbians who decides that such a display is unacceptable and stops
taking his three kids to the game, the owner has a problem.
It seems to me that you're the one taking rights away, or perhaps you
genuinely don't believe that property rights are valid.  In that case,
we have no common ground from which to even begin to discuss

I think this is the fundamental difference.  The only argument I can
put forth is that legislating based on outcomes is nearly impossible.
How am I to know that X will happen?  If it does, and I am being held
accountable, can I say that I didn't know it was going to happen?  If
so, then how do you enforce the law?  If not, what protection do I
have from a government that seeks to persecute me?
The essential difference is that restricting positive liberties tends
to have the effect of restricting a narrow range of actions (you
cannot murder someone), whereas restricting negative liberties cuts a
wide swath (you cannot shun your neighbor, or, equivalently, you must
associate with your neighbor).
True, but it is at least useful.  Starting from, for example, Nozick's
"state of nature" can be helpful as, at the very least, a thought
Perhaps I was not as clear as I should have been.  The word
intractible may have been a better one to use.  It is tractible to
keep theives from getting into my store in all but the most extreme
circumstances.  It is wholly intractible to make it impossible for a
given person to see the light from a lighthouse.
I can see that we have basically two differences in opinion from which
all of this stems.  First, you are willing to evaluate based on
outcomes, whereas I say it is impossible to do so.  Second, you are
willing to impose restrictions on negative liberty, and I am not.

There are variations on this that are quite interesting, although they
will probably damage your microwave (then again, the one I've been
doing it with for years still makes my ramen in three minutes :-)
First off, get rid of the glass bowl and forget about the ten second
time limit.  Both are unnecessary, and they reduce the size and
lifetime of the plasmoids (although they may damage the microwave---
then again, as mentioned above, mine still works).
Second, experiment with different spots in your microwave.  Especially
in older microwaves, some places are more powerful than others.  If
you put your burning {paper, toothpick, dishrag, charcoal} in one of
these "hot spots," suddenly your plasmoids will appear sooner, last
longer, and look cooler.  If your microwave has a turning tray, place
the medium on the tray to begin with, and observe where the plasmoid
activity is the greatest.  Once you find the hot spot, remove the
carousel and put the medium in that spot.
Finally, and potentially the coolest, play around with your burning
medium.  Paper works better than toothpicks in general because the
bigger the flame, the bigger the plasmoids.  I like to use newspaper
and toilet paper.  Perhaps the most spectacular show I've ever seen
came from a small bit of crushed charcoal on a bed of fine steel wool.
For this one, you don't have to light it---the steel wool will glow
hot enough to light the charcoal and produce the plasmoids.  If it
doesn't work, you're probably using too much charcoal.
The only things you should really avoid are large sheets of metal
(aluminum foil, etc).  These tend to reflect the microwave energy very
well and turn your microwave into a dog welder :-)
Of course, I disclaim any and all liability associated with the above.
I will accept no responsibility in the case that you injure yourself
or anyone else while trying this.

May 11, 2000
Mr. John Podesta
White House Chief of Staff
The White House
First Floor, West Wing
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. Podesta:
I am writing to alert you to information that is of profound importance to
President Clintons impending decision on whether to deploy the currently
under development National Missile Defense system. I have obtained and
analyzed the Ballistic Missile Defense Organizations (BMDOs) own published
data from the Integrated Flight Test 1A (IFT-1A) and have discovered that the
BMDOs own data shows that the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) will be
defeated by the simplest of balloon decoys. I also have documentation that
shows that the BMDO in coordination with its contractors attempted to hide
this fact by tampering with both the data and analysis from the IFT-1A
experiment. In addition, it appears that the BMDO modified the configuration
of the IFT-2, 3, and 4 follow-on flight tests to hide the program-stopping
facts revealed in the IFT-1A. The documentation and analysis that supports my
claims are attached to this letter as Attachments A through D.
In the remainder of this letter I will briefly summarize the findings
documented in the four attachments.
Attachments A and B explain how the BMDOs own data from the IFT-1A test shows
that the BMDO falsely represented the results of the IFT-1A test as showing
that an Exotamospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) can tell warheads from simple
balloon decoys. It is easy to understand this result from a simple
explanation of how the EKV works (see Attachments A and B for further
The EKV sees both decoys and warheads as unresolved points of light, and it
attempts to find warheads by examining how each point of light fluctuates in
time. The intensity of the signal from each potentially lethal object depends
on its size, temperature, surface materials and spatial orientation, and the
fluctuation in the signal from each object depends on how its orientation
changes in time. The data from the IFT-1A experiment showed that the changing
spatial orientation of the decoys and warheads as they fell through the near
vacuum of space was nearly the same, each resulting in a signal that
fluctuated in a varied and totally unpredictable way. Consequently, the
IFT-1A data showed that there was no fluctuating feature in the signals from
decoys and warheads that could be used to distinguish one object from the
One of the early post-flight manifestations of this fact was immediately
evident when the BMDO review of the telemetry data from the IFT-1A flight
test resulted in the defense system always wrongly identifying a partially
inflated balloon as the mock warhead. The team performing the post-flight
analysis dealt with this failure by simply removing the balloon from the
data, as if it was never there.
Even after removing the balloon, the post-flight experimental data still
showed that two other benign objects were brighter than the warhead and
therefore were judged more likely to be the mock warhead. The team performing
the post-flight experiment analysis dealt with this outcome by arbitrarily
rejecting the data from the time interval where the two other objects were
brighter, and instead chose without technical reason a second time period
where the warhead was brighter due to the accident of its spatial
orientation. This elaborate hoax was then screened by describing this
tampering with the data and analysis in terms of misleading, confusing, and
self contradictory language to create the false impression that the results
were supported by well established scientific methods.
In truth, the procedures followed by the BMDO were like rolling a pair of
dice and throwing away all outcomes that did not give snake eyes, and then
fraudulently making a claim that they have scientific evidence to show that
they could reliably predict when a roll of the dice will be a snake eyes.
These meretricious procedures used by the analysis team were applied because
the IFT-1A data revealed that the signals from some of the decoys in the
experiment were essentially indistinguishable from that of the mock warhead.
Stated differently, the signals from both the warhead and balloons had no
features that could be exploited to tell one from the other using credible
scientific methods so the team invented a set of fraudulent methods to get
the desired result.
In view of the results of the IFT-1A experiment, it is now clear why the
IFT-2, 3, and 4 experiments were re-configured following the analysis of
After the IFT-1A experiment, the BMDO changed the number of objects it
planned to fly in follow-on experiments from ten to four. The four objects
were to be a medium reentry vehicle (MRV), a 2.2 meter diameter balloon, and
two balloons of diameter 0.6 meters.
Some time after this reduction in the number of objects to be flown in IFT-2,
3, and 4 experiments, the number of objects was again changed. This time the
two 0.6 meter balloons were removed, because of the high probability that the
seeker would mistake one of them for the mock warhead. This action further
reduced the number of objects for the IFT-2, 3, and 4 follow-on experiments
from four to two, leaving only a single large balloon and a medium warhead.
The fidelity of the IFT-2, 3, and 4 experiments was further undermined by the
BMDO through the careful choice of a time of day for the intercept attempt,
which placed the sun behind the EKV illuminating the balloon and warhead from
the front. In this experimental geometry, the willful insertion of the 2.2
meter diameter balloon converted it from what otherwise might have been a
credible decoy to an object that was unambiguously a beacon. In addition, the
very large differences in the intensity between the balloon and warhead made
it easy to distinguish between the two targets while at the same time making
it easier for the EKV to home on the dimmer but still very bright warhead
near the balloon.
The results of the IFT-1A experiment, and the way it was allowed to influence
the modifications to the IFT-2, 3, and 4 experiments, is of profound signific
ance for the Presidents decision on whether or not to move forward with the
current National Missile Defense concept, as it is now clear that the entire
concept relies on a flawed analysis of the most basic and critical flight
test data. When the data from these experiments are properly analyzed and
interpreted, they indicate that the current NMD system will not be able to
reliably deal with even the most simple first generation countermeasures.
Such trivially simple countermeasures could include the use of tumbling
warheads, partially inflated balloon decoys, and decoys and warheads
constructed with tethered objects and rabbit-ear type appendages.
The points made herein can be readily verified by a careful review of the
study Independent Review of TRW Discrimination Techniques Final Report, (POET
Study 1998-5). This document (included here as Attachment D) contains a mix
of irrelevant and profound findings about the post-flight analysis of the
telemetry data, creating a superficial but false impression of a sound
scientific analysis. A careful reading of this report and the related
documents included in the attachments instead reveals the following:
* Data that demonstrated that the EKV would always mistake a partially
  inflated balloon for the mock lethal object was inexplicably removed from
  the post-flight analysis of the EKVs performance.
* After this data was removed, the data from the eight other remaining benign
  objects and the lethal mock warhead showed that the system would still
  mistakenly choose two of the benign objects instead of the lethal object.
* In order to alter this unfavorable outcome, the team tampered with both the
  data and the analysis of the data to artificially create a false outcome
  where the system would choose the mock warhead.
This highly organized and systematic pattern of actions has the appearance of
an elaborate scientific and technical blunder, which urgently needs to be
investigated by a team of scientists who are recognized for their scientific
accomplishments and independence from the Pentagon. Fortunately, the physical
phenomena and analysis techniques at issue here are well known to many highly
skilled independent scientists who work on problems in basic physics,
computer science, and in the analysis of statistical data, so assembling a
team of top-notch independent scientists who can evaluate the BMDOs
analytical claims should be no problem.
I urge the White House to put together such a team of scientists who can
independently evaluate the procedures used to reach these erroneous
conclusions about the content of the telemetry data from the IFT-1A flight
test and the subsequent modifications of the IFT-2, 3, and 4 flight tests.
Attachments A, B, C, and D contain detailed explanations of the findings
provided in this letter along with the documentation from which they are

@_subject: About lawyers and spoliation 
I'm quite skeptical.  As I see it, there would be two general ways of
doing this:
1) Each person has his/her own static IP address that is inextricably
linked to his/her biometric data.
2) One presents biometric credentials in order to use a particular IP
address, and a system similar to DNS can be used to resolve IP
addresses to biometric credentials (or perhaps, all network admins are
required to keep logs of who was using what IP address at what time).
(1) is clearly impossible, if only because all currently-used routing
protocols would be broken.  Imagine if I (18.243.0.246) went to visit
a friend at CMU (128.2.11.43).  How would packets to me be routed?
Admittedly, there is Mobile IP, a protocol that allows me to roam with
a static IP address, but it was never popularized because DHCP
administration is easier and has fewer nasty, subtle problems.
(2) is also not likely.  It doesn't seem that the government could get
away with requiring network admins to keep logs or run servers all the
time any more than they could get away with running carnivore on every
major ISP all the time.  Perhaps in specific cases they could, with
the aid of a warrant, force a certain provider to track all
information pertaining to a specific IP address, but this is far from
"your IP will be biometrically associated."
Even if a few governments succeeded in forcing this sort of thing,
there are several ways of getting around it.  Perhaps the best is
mixnets, but a simpler (albeit weaker) solution is to just get an
offshore shell account and run an SSH tunnel to a proxy there.  Hell,
that's more or less the way that I get access to the internet at work,
and I'm sure you'd have a hard time finding out what the IP address of
the machine at which I'm currently sitting is without compromising my
proxy machine.
Perhaps I'm totally off-base with all of this.  Are there already
protocols out there for linking biometric data to IP address?  A quick
google search didn't turn anything up, but I might have missed

A speeder, in this discussion, is a person who breaks the speed limit
imposed by the _rental_contract_, not the state.  If the company has
the technological ability to accurately (or inaccurately, although
that would probably be bad for business) measure the speed of the car,
they can tell if the person is exceeding their contractually
determined speed, that is, "speeding."  If the contract says they can

I know I sound naive asking this, but has something like this ever
happened in the US?  The way I read this, the NZ court ordered a private publisher of an
enumeration of IP addresses to modify his publication despite the fact
that the IP addresses in question met the criteria for inclusion on
the list.  (ORBS claimed to be a list of open relays, but it was well
known that it included any network that blocked ORBS probes, which
apparently included the two companies in question.)  In addition, even
if it did include networks that didn't fit the stated criteria for
inclusion on the list, it seems to me that the circumstances under
which a particular entry is added to the list are completely
immaterial---for any particular entry on the list, its inclusion only
indicates that the ORBS administrators are not adequately assured that
spam will not originate from the IP address in quesiton.  Doesn't seem
like that could possibly be considered libel.
One might be able to make the case that being listed in ORBS was
damaging in that outgoing email from a listed system would be blocked
by lots of people, but that doesn't seem compelling---people are
_choosing_ to block traffic from your server based on the fact that
they trust the recommendations of ORBS and, according to ORBS, it
cannot be ascertained that spam will not originate from the system.
Like I said, I'm probably just naive.

No, but you do need to authenticate with the DVD-ROM drive.  To do
this, at least under Linux, you have to invoke the proper ioctls, and
do a cryptographic authentication procedure with the drive.  Code to
do this is covered under "circumvention device" in the DMCA according
to the 2600-MPAA case.
If you don't do this authentication, the drives I have worked with
will just spit out zeros instead of the real data.

@_subject: eBay: Burn DVD movies onto CD? 
Even so, the fact that it's Linux isn't the point.  The fact is, you
have to do some hardware handshaking before you can read the data.  It
just happens that it's via an ioctl interface in Linux, and I only
mentioned that as a specific example.
Not really.  Part of 2600's claim is that DeCSS and css-auth allow
people using operating systems without officially licensed DVD player
software (with development cost starting at $20k just for the license
to implement the standard) to view DVDs that they purchased.  The
judge didn't buy it; it doesn't matter that they legally paid for the
content, they're accessing it illegally via a "circumvention device."
The DMCA, according to the court, clearly prevents the use of DeCSS
and css-auth, even in the case that it has a legitimate use, because
it circumvents the access control measures built into the DVD
I don't see how this applies to what I was saying.  The reason I
tagged this on is to show that one must authenticate if one plans to
read the data.  Thus, the EBay offering has to use some sort of
authentication mechanism.  If it uses one that is not officially
licensed (read this: upwards of $20k development cost), it is illegal,
according to the court.
I'm not agreeing with the DMCA, or with the judge's decision regarding
DeCSS.  Neither are palatable, to say the least.  The original
question was "can this be done legally."  The answer is: if someone
paid to develop a licensed implementation of the DVD standard, yes.  I
don't know of any commercial software that will read the data from the
DVD and spit out the raw data, encrypted or not, for writing to a CD.
The DVD CCA would never license such a piece of software---its use is
too clearly geared towards backup or, as they see it, piracy.

Up to this point, I agree with everything you have said.
That's true.  However, in order to read data from a DVD, you must
first "authenticate" to the DVD player.  This is before any decryption
takes place.  This is a cryptographic handshake mechanism using a key.
If you do not perform this handshake, it is not possible to read the
You are correct that this does not involve decryption.  It does,
however, involve circumventing a part of the DVD protection
mechanism---the one that protects the raw bits from being read off the
disk.  DVD player software does this handshake directly.  It is not handled
by the operating system, nor should it be, according to the DVD CCA.
No mechanism will be licensed by the DVD CCA that allows the raw bits
to be accessed, according to another post on this thread.  Thus, you
must access the raw bits using unlicensed software---i.e. a
circumvention device.
To summarize: dd if=/dev/dvd of=pirated.file *does*not*work*.  You
must first run some sort of program to authenticate with the drive.
Then you can dd as much as you like.  The problem is with the
authentication program---by the DVD CCA's licensing standards, no such
program can be legit.  Thus, according to the current 2600-MPAA
decision, what is being sold on EBay is illegal, assuming that it does
what it claims to do.

I totally agree with you about all of the above statements.  I read
the original question as "would this be illegal under the DMCA?"  My
replies were all modulo the current reading of the DMCA as implied by
the 2600-MPAA case.  As far as I'm concerned, no, the government and various media
corporations should not have the ability to restrict the way in which
I employ their content.  If it's scrambled, that's another obstacle to
my viewing, but it shouldn't be one backed by anything stronger than
the algorithm which the distributor has chosen to employ.  That is,
men with guns shouldn't be there to make sure I don't break or
otherwise circumvent CSS, nor should it be my "social responsibility"
not to do so.  The burden of protecting content is on the corporation
providing the content, not on me.

Jim, I must admit I'm surprised to see even the likes of you making
the above argument.  The question is thus: "were actions X, Y, and Z acts of terrorism or
acts of war?"  If the answer is war, the insurance contract states
that no coverage will be provided.  If the answer is terrorism, the
insurance companies will have to pay in full the $11e9 policy carried
by the WTC.  If there is some disagreement as to whether or not the
attacks were acts of terrorism or acts of war, it will be settled in
court.  In said court, the standard that will be considered is the
legal one.  See below for
Clearly, then, the original question did include that boundary
None of the above is relevant.  According to 22 USC Sec. 2656f(d) [1]:
The House Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans' Affairs, and
International Relations has stated that the above sets the standard
for a terrorist act [2].
By this definition, it's pretty clear that the events of 9/11 were
terrorism.  If there is a government that was supporting the people who committed
Tuesday's acts of terrorism, the only action that can be considered an
act of war is that of lending support or quarter to the terrorists.
The terrorists are still responsible for the destruction of the WTC,
and said destruction is still an act of terrorism.
Thus, it is undoubtedly the case that an act of terrorism was
committed in the destruction of the WTC.  In addition, it is possible
that an act of war has been committed, although it is currently
unclear whether one has or not.

No.  Your acceptance or rejection of my definitions is irrelevant.
I'm predicting what definitions will be used by those who are
important in this situation---the people acting to decide whether or
not the insurance policy will be paid.
You can question them, but in this case it's clear that the
definitions that are important are those that the insurance company
will use in determining whether an act of war was committed.  If they
don't pay out, the people who hold the policies will go to court, and
once in court the legal definition will be used.
Perhaps they do not agree with your definitions.  I contend that my
definitions are accurate inasmuch as they reflect those which will be
used when the people who will eventually make this decision endeavor
to do so.
Yes, but it does not recognize that state-sponsored terrorism
constitutes an act of war, which is the important question here.
The question here was "will the insurance companies pay out?"  My
answer was that this was clearly an act of terrorism and not an act of
war.  Even if it were sponsored by a state, it would be an act of
terrorism, not an act of war.  I'm not questioning the existence of
state-sponsored terrorism.
Interesting that you're accusing me of ad hominem attacks and the use
of straw men, as this is your standard m.o.---in this case, the
squirrel definitions that started this ridiculous discussion and 'your

I'm not sure I agree with it, and it's probably all been said before,
but I thought some might like reading this.
Recently, I was asked to look at the recent events through the lens of
military history.  I have joined the cast of thousands who have written an
"open letter to Americans."
Dear friends and fellow Americans                 14 September, 2001
Like everyone else in this great country, I am reeling from last week's
attack on our sovereignty. But unlike some, I am not reeling from surprise.
 As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history, I have
a different perspective and I think you should hear it. This war will be
won or lost by the American citizens, not diplomats, politicians or
Let me briefly explain.
In spite of what the media, and even our own government is telling us, this
act was not committed by a group of mentally deranged fanatics. To dismiss
them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes. This attack was
committed by a ferocious, intelligent and dedicated adversary. Don't take
this the wrong way. I don't admire these men and I deplore their tactics,
but I respect their capabilities. The many parallels that have been made
with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos. Not only because it
was a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent America, but also because
we may well be pulling our new adversaries out of caves 30 years after we
think this war is over, just like my father's generation had to do with the
formidable Japanese in the years following WW II.
These men hate the United States with all of their being, and we must not
underestimate the power of their moral commitment. Napoleon, perhaps the
world's greatest combination of soldier and statesman, stated "the moral is
to the physical as three is to one." Patton thought the Frenchman
underestimated its importance and said moral conviction was five times more
important in battle than physical strength. Our enemies are willing -
better said anxious-to give their lives for their cause.
How committed are we America? And for how long?
In addition to demonstrating great moral conviction, the recent attack
demonstrated a mastery of some of the basic fundamentals of warfare taught
to most military officers worldwide, namely simplicity, security and
surprise. When I first heard rumors that some of these men may have been
trained at our own Air War College, it made perfect sense to me. This was
not a random act of violence, and we can expect the same sort of military
competence to be displayed in the battle to come.
This war will escalate, with a good portion of it happening right here in
the good ol' U.S. of A.
These men will not go easily into the night. They do not fear us. We must
not fear them. In spite of our overwhelming conventional strength as the
world's only "superpower" (a truly silly term), we are the underdog in this
fight. As you listen to the carefully scripted rhetoric designed to prepare
us for the march for war, please realize that America is not equipped or
seriously trained for the battle ahead. To be certain, our soldiers are
much better than the enemy, and we have some excellent "counter-terrorist"
organizations, but they are mostly trained for hostage rescues, airfield
seizures, or the occasional "body snatch," (which may come in handy). We
will be fighting a war of annihilation, because if their early efforts are
any indication, our enemy is ready and willing to die to the last man.
Eradicating the enemy will be costly and time consuming. They have already
deployed their forces in as many as 20 countries, and are likely living the
lives of everyday citizens. Simply put, our soldiers will be tasked with a
search and destroy mission on multiple foreign landscapes, and the public
must be patient and supportive until the strategy and tactics can be worked
For the most part, our military is still in the process of redefining
itself and presided over by men and women who grew up with - and were
promoted because they excelled in - Cold War doctrine, strategy and
tactics. This will not be linear warfare, there will be no clear "centers
of gravity" to strike with high technology weapons. Our vast technological
edge will certainly be helpful, but it will not be decisive. Perhaps the
perfect metaphor for the coming battle was introduced by the terrorists
themselves aboard the hijacked aircraft-this will be a knife fight, and it
will be won or lost by the ingenuity and will of citizens and soldiers, not
by software or smart bombs. We must also be patient with our military
Unlike Americans who are eager to put this messy time behind us, our
adversaries have time on their side, and they will use it. They plan to
fight a battle of attrition, hoping to drag the battle out until the
American public loses its will to fight. This might be difficult to believe
in this euphoric time of flag waving and patriotism, but it is generally
acknowledged that America lacks the stomach for a long fight. We need only
look as far back as Vietnam, when North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap
(also a military history teacher) defeated the United States of America
without ever winning a major tactical battle. American soldiers who marched
to war cheered on by flag waving Americans in 1965 were reviled and spat
upon less than three years later when they returned. Although we hope that
Usama Bin Laden is no Giap, he is certain to understand and employ the
concept. We can expect not only large doses of pain like the recent
attacks, but! also less audacious "sand in the gears" tactics, ranging from
livestock infestations to attacks at water supplies and power distribution
These attacks are designed to hit us in our "comfort zone" forcing the
average American to "pay more and play less" and eventually eroding our
resolve. But it can only work if we let it. It is clear to me that the will
of the American citizenry - you and I - is the center of gravity the enemy
has targeted. It will be the fulcrum upon which victory or defeat will
turn.  He believes us to be soft, impatient, and self-centered. He may be
right, but if so, we must change. The Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz,
(the most often quoted and least read military theorist in history), says
that there is a "remarkable trinity of war" that is composed of the (1)
will of the people, (2) the political leadership of the government, and (3)
the chance and probability that plays out on the field of battle, in that
order.  Every American citizen was in the crosshairs of last Tuesday's
attack, not just those that were unfortunate enough to be in the World
Trade Center or Pentagon. The will of the American people will decide this
war. If we are to win, it will be because we have what it takes to
persevere through a few more hits, learn from our mistakes, improvise, and
adapt. If we can do that, we will eventually prevail.
Everyone I've talked to In the past few days has shared a common
frustration, saying in one form or another "I just wish I could do
something!" You are already doing it. Just keep faith in America, and
continue to support your President and military, and the outcome is
If we fail to do so, the outcome is equally certain.
