And from a protocol perspective, it would be worse, at least for
SSL, since SSL doesn't have a 56 bit RC4 mode at all.

Since this workaround requires changing the configuration file, it's equally easy to disable SSLv2 entirely--especially
since one could easily modify the worm to attack all servers
or, perhaps, those which only display Product ID :)

... or maybe not.
I hadn't seen a copy of the worm yet, so I guessed from your
description that it was using the Server: value to detect who is
running downrev versions of OpenSSL. Not so.
Upon examination, it looks like the worm uses the server version to
decide what section of memory to overwrite (based on the target OS)
and server version. So, if people reconfiged their servers to not give
you this information, a worm author would either have to have the worm
try all possible exploits (not a big deal with only 20 architectures
to search) or have some other evidence as to what OS/Apache version
people were runnning.
Note that for this to be a 100% countermeasure you'd have to
reconfigure your server not to advertise Apache at all. Otherwise,
it looks to me like the worm assumes that you're running
Red Hat/Apache 1.3.23, in which case there's a real chance
that the worm will crash your server by using the wrong
overwrite offset.

Hmm.... I'd characterize the situation a little differently.
There are a number of standard building blocks (3DES, AES, RSA, HMAC,
SSL, S/MIME, etc.). While none of these building blocks are known
to be secure, we know that:
(1) They have withstood a lot of concerted attempts to attack them.
(2) Prior attempts at building such systems revealed a lot of problems
    which these building blocks are designed to avoid.
(3) People who attempt to design new systems generally make some
    of the mistakes from (2) and so generally design a system inferior
    to the standard ones.
We're slowly proving the correctness of these building blocks and
replacing the weaker ones with others that rely upon tighter
proofs (e.g. OAEP for PKCS-1) but it's a long process. However, I don't
think it's helpful to design a new system that doesn't have any obvious advantages over one of the standard systems.

It's vastly better than "just designed last week by someone
who has no relevant experience"

I don't think this is likely to be true. In my experience,
people who learn enough to design their own thing also learn
enough to be able to do SSL properly.
That's not true as far as I know. V1 and V2 were designed
by the same guy (Kipp Hickman). V1 is actually very similar
to V2, except that the integrity stuff is all screwed up.
As far as I can tell, the fact of the matter is that Kipp didn't understand the security issues until Abadi and
to some extent Schiffman sold them some clues.
As far as I know, that's not the case. The original Netscape
team was very small and there really weren't any significant
choices to be made.
That's not my experience. WEP and PPTP come to mind.
I would say the highest level primitives you can get away with.
SSL is quite fine for chat, actually. It's one of the major things that people use for IM. The issue with
speech and media isn't connection-orientation but
rather datagram versus stream data.
The history of people who go this course suggests otherwise.
They generally get lousy solutions.

One learns by *practicing*.
That said, though, there's next to no need for people to know how
to design their own communications security protocols, so it's
not really that important for them to learn. The rough version of it is in my book.

Because HTTPS is designed to let you talk to people you've
never talked before, which is an inherently harder problem
than allowing you to talk to people you have.

Nonsense. One can simply cache the certificate, exactly as
one does with SSH. In fact, Mozilla at least does exactly
this if you tell it to. The reason that this is uncommon
is because the environments where HTTPS is used
are generally spontaneous and therefore certificate caching
is less useful.

The only solutions to that problem involve getting rid of
passwords and credit card numbers. SSL does that job about
as well as we know how.

This isn't really true in the SSL case:
To a first order, everyone ignores any extensions (except sometimes
the constraints) and uses the CN for the DNS name of the server.

I've had to do this on environments where threads weren't a viable
option. See, for instance, my paper from USENIX Security 2002.

It's utterly baffling to me why people like this choose to design
their own thing rather than just using SSL. I've looked through their
design documents and glanced at their code they don't provide any
security features that SSL doesn't, and they appear to have made a
number of questionable design decisions:
(0) Their messages don't appear have any sequence numbers, making them
    potentially open to a wide variety of integrity attacks. They have some sort
    of guid but unless you intend to keep a record of all guids through
    a session (horrible) this is only a partial fix for replay and     not a fix at all for removal.
(1) They use MD5 instead of HMAC for message authentication. Scary.
(2) They use the same encryption keys in both directions. At least
    they have the sense to run separate PCBC counters. However,
    based on the code it doesn't look like they reset the PCBC
    counters after a bad message is received so you may be able to
    mount a reflection attack.
(3) They use Blowfish (why not AES?) in PCBC mode (huh?)
I don't think it's worth much time analyzing this... Just one
more case of NIH.

Hey boys and girls! Want to help your country defeat that mean old
Osama? Then check out the National Security Agency's CryptoKids web site
    On this site, you can learn all about codes and ciphers, play lots
    of games and activities, and get to know each of us - Crypto Cat,
    Decipher Dog, Rosetta Stone, Slate, Joules, T.Top, and, of course,
    our leader CSS Sam.
    You can also learn about the National Security Agency/Central
    Security Service - they're Americas real codemakers and
    codebreakers. Our Nation's leaders and warfighters count on the
    technology and information they get from NSA/CSS to get their jobs
    done. Without NSA/CSS, they wouldnt be able to talk to one another
    without the bad guys listening and they wouldnt be able to figure
    out what the bad guys were planning.
    We hope you have lots of fun learning about cryptology and
    NSA/CSS. You might be part of the next generation of Americas
    codemakers and codebreakers.
The site comes complete with a bunch of material on making and breaking
simple codes (cool), resources to teach kids about crypto (also cool),
and detailed biographies of the CryptoKids characters (kind of
creepy). Here's some of what CryptoCat does for fun:
    I'm usually hanging out with my friends at the mall or catching the
    latest movie. I love helping people so I find different ways to help
    out around the community. Right now, I volunteer as a swim coach for
    children with special needs. Its a lot of fun AND I get to spend
    extra time with my sister who has Downs Syndrome.
The NSA Gifted and Talented program looks pretty cool, though.
