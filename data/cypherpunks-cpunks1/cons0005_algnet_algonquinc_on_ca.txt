@_subject: Email Bot 
I was wondering if anyone knows of such a creature that I could send email to with an URL, and I would get a reply of that HTML file?
example I email   bot at somewhere.com with the and I will get an email of the HTML file at This would be handy because I don't have a broswer (2 meg RAM (I know)) and also for anonymity, cookies etc I couldn't be traced.
When you send mail, do you use a postcard or an envelope?
