@_subject: Dutch government asked to create "digital safe deposit 
declan on Wed, Apr 18, 2001 at 10:16:50AM -0500
After a quick skim of the commission's paper I do not think this
"digital safe" is meant to be a general purpose holder of information
but is intended as a more modern, more accessable holder of the
information already managed by the municipal governments (name, address,
date and place of birth, social security number, nationality) with the
possibility of containing additional information such as biometrics and
fiscal income. All these will be subject to access control and will be
unlocked to the citizens by use of the new generation passport (which
will also contain smartcard with a certificate). Government agencies
will gain access in a similar way as they do now (which is independently
audited and, in contrast to many other countries, always subject to
public verification).
The costs are estimated at 65,8 Mfl (app. 30MEuro) from 2001-2008, this
is including design, implementation and roll-out. This translates to
about 2 Euro per person.
As presented, the newer system stores and manages the same kind of
information the old systems do, but in a more visible and for the
citizen more controlable way. The major drawback I see is that this
system seems to be highly centralized, which makes it less resistant to
large scale compromittation as the current, highly decentralized system.
Let's just hope that they will build on strong technologies and not use
the swiss cheeses of security from Redmond.
By the way, the Telepolis article
 is far
better in summarizing this then the quoted article.

I recently got their paper and although it is very interesting for image
classification, it seems of limited use for reconstruction of printed
text from shredded documents. The authors describe a method for
classification of textures to a compact representation (a 2NK long
vector) and a way of determining the most likely texture class a given
pixel is part of (by examining the pixels neighbours), with an error
probability of 22% for 10 different textures. Although not described in
the paper, I assume the pixels of the same class can be grouped into
"patches" of the same texture, allow jigsaw-like problem solving.
I don't think this texture classification method is going to work on
normal printed text, as it has no real distinguishing texture. For
shredded pictures the classification method will probably be effective
in reducing the pictures of the shreds to smaller distinguishing values
that can be used for a jigsaw solving algorithm.
So as I see it, the real question is: how viable is the reconstruction
of the complete "puzzle" given most/all of the pieces, some valueset
indicating the probability two pieces are neigbours and maybe some
information on the overall picture? Looks like a hard problem.

@_subject: A perfect example of what's wrong with modern legal 
>; from ravage on Tue, Jul 03, 2001 at 04:18:24PM -0500
Hmmm, in the news here in the Netherlands a Dutch law professor
said that a guilty plea from Milosevic would obviate the "(dis)proving
of guilt"-part of the trial and everything would therefor move to
determining the measure of punishment. A plea of not guilty means the
trial can start immediately. If no plea is entered, the trial will
proceed after a month without a guilty plea. This is not the same as
recording it as a non-guilty plea, it's just giving the defendant a
month the time to decide whether he wants to skip the part about proving
he did it. Seem logically sound to me.
Obviously, this is not in the interests of Milosevic.

Obviously. But to use the texture classification method for
'deshredding', the paper must consist of multiple distinct textures or
else you will not get any information out of the method besides the type
of paper used. For deshredding, the likelyhood of two pieces of
paper being previously attached is needed.
So for this to be usable on paper, paper needs to have significantly
varying texture. For rice-paper, parchment and watermarks I can see this
work, but for normal paper?? Does anyone have experience in this or a
