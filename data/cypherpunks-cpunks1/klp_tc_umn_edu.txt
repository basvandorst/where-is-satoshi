One of the problems that efnext is trying to address, and
a cause of network instability is DOS attacks against
servers by little kiddies that want to take over channels.
Not that I'm for or against the new network, but it seems
that building a consensus and peer review of the protocols
would be a good thing.
As for the fear that this will lead to central control
and monitoring of the IRC network, my guess is that IRC is already heavily monitored.  It's a hell of a lot more
trivial than Usenet with only 33 servers on the network,
and each communication tagged with the hostname or IP
address that originated it.
