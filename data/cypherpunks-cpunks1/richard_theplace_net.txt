I'm new to this list, so hello everyone.  I'm also on the other side of the pond, so I'm interested in what you are recounting.  Here, in the UK, stalking is illegal, so is recording phone conversations covertly.  But the police are installing a network of CCTV -- not the general surveillance cameras in town centres which everyone loves, but a new set of low-level cameras that are directed into the windscreens of vehicles passing.  So they can track exactly who goes where when.  I'm not sure what intelligence they have installed (so far).  In fact, I am not sure of anything about them, because they have never been mentioned in the media, and most people I've talked to haven't even noticed they are I'm wondering whether to try marketing driving masks...  And whether, if I did, they would be outlawed (on grounds that they reduce driver vision and cause danger, of course).

Except that I'd certainly expect the police here to treat politicians a little differently from other drivers -- unless the public was looking, and these cameras aren't in the pubic domain.
That is a very good point.  I think getting a car with dark glass may be a better response.
I had a look at that URL.  Star Office browser crashed trying to open it, but when using IE5 I got at least the text.  I've copied it below in case you or others would like to see.
