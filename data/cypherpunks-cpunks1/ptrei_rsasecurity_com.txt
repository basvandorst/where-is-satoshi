Many places have 'mask laws' which criminalize the wearing of masks
in public. Some times there are exceptions for costume balls, etc, but
generally these laws are very selectively enforced. I seem to remember
there were some prosecutions in the US in relation to the WTO protests
and in London following the May Day protests.
Unless there is a specific loophole for Muslim women's veils, I suppose
they are technically in violation, but as I said, these laws are hardly

Jim claims it has to do with 'property rights' the husband has in the wife.
This really applies more to purdah, the practice of isolating women from
society as a whole, or allowing them to contact non-family males only under carefully chaperoned situations. While veiling has some application
to this, it is more done to prevent inciting male lust. If you grew up in a
where the only women you saw were either relatives, or completely veiled,
a bare face or a 'glimpse of stocking' would be quite exciting.
I've read articles written by Western women who have lived in countries
where women were required to veil completely. Some of them actually
came to rather like it - under the veil they had privacy - no one could
mark them as a foreigner, they could come and go anywhere as easily
as a native. Underneath they could dress for comfort, not style or appearance. They felt safer.

I'd like to voice my agreement on this. Here in Massachusetts, the state
is considered such a Democrat stronghold that we've seen almost
zero campaigning by either major party (while this is usually considered a
godsend, I'm starting to feel ignored :-). At the local level, Senator Ted Kennedy's seat is up for re-election, but
Ted has such a lock on it that he isn't bothering to campaign. The
state's Republicans have managed to self-destruct (their initial candidate withdrew, and Jack Robinson, the replacement who popped up at the last minute, has proved utterly without merit - the state party no longer
him, and he's out of money).
All indications are that Carla Howell, the Libertarian challenger for
Kennedy's Senate seat, will handily out-poll the Republicans this year.
As a result, my vote is immaterial to either major party, and I can happily
vote my conscience without any fear that I'm helping throw the election to
either Gush or Bore - both of whom I find utterly odious for intersecting
of reasons.
(Just in case you were wondering, I'm voting Libertarian).

EZ-Pass is a perfect example of people choosing convenience over security, and a bad design "creating the tools for tyranny". While the accounting system most certainly keeps records

is structured in such a way that an intrusive government can
place antennas anywhere they want, and clandestinely record all EZ-Pass equipped vehicles passing a given point
(even if it is not a toll site).
[It just struck me that there may be a novel legal challenge to
this; since you have contracted with a transport agency to
use EZ-Pass, any non-contractual activation of the system
could be legally construed as computer hacking - the snooping
antenna has to power up your EZ-pass' chip (that's what those
big inductive loop antennas are for), cause it to run a program,
and return a result. If the EZ-Pass is rented from the authority
I don't know if you'd have standing to sue, though.]
Of course, EZ-Pass could have been designed so that the

[Learn to use your 'Shift' key; it's there for a reason.]
I expect that we still have an electoral college because amending the
Constitution is a very laborious process, and fixing it has no constituancy;
one party is about as likely to benefit from it as another.
As to why we have one in the first place....
At the founding of the US, the franchise was far from universal; women,
slaves, and non-landowners were excluded - it was felt that such people were either congenitally unfit, or (in the case of the propertyless)
too shiftless to exercise a vote responsibly. Voting was regarded as a very important act, and it was neccesary to restrict it to an
educated, socially responsible elite, to whom the welfare of their society
was a personal interest (this limited franchise also existed in England).
At the same time, the FF wanted to have a government which represented the people as a whole.
There was a considerable difference to the formation of society in the
different states; in the North, there were a very large number of small
family farms, the heads of which each qualified as voters. In the South,
most of the land was owned by a much smaller number of owners of
huge plantations, which might have dozens or hundreds of people, but
only one landowner who could vote. Thus, the ratio of voters to the general populace differed between North and South.
At the time of the Constitutional convention, Virginia was the most
populous state, but it fell into the Southern mode. If all votes were weighed equally in selecting the president, Virginia and the other populous plantation system states would get the short end of the stick. Virginians were a powerful group in the CC, and rammed
through the electoral college system. In this, the number of electoral votes was proportional to the total number of people (not just voters) in the state (Indians were not counted, and slaves counted as 3/5s of a free person each).
As the franchise was gradually expanded, the role of the electoral college has become more and more irrelevant.
Since the Civil Rights movement of the early 60's (the last time
a large group gained real voting rights) , it's been about as useful as an appendix
This is the first election since then that it's been a problem. That's
why we still have it.

Calls to or from their Snapshield equipped phones are routed via a special PBX box which provides encryption between the PBX and the phone. If both phones support encryption, the entire link is encrypted. Their page is kind of light on details. In particular it's not clear whether
session keys are negotiated between the 'Snapgate' PBX box or
between two of the phone boxes. Since they support point-to-multipoint
calling, and indicate that monitoring is possible, I suspect the former.
For some users, this means that the Snapgate box is an unacceptable point of attack. I can't find any suggestion of
robust authentication, though I have not checked everything on their site.
They are targetting telcos (for people willing to outsource their
security) and large private networks.
Anyone have any more information or comments on this product?

[Warning in advance: I don't run a remailer, and never have, so what

I would like to suggest that a remailer could eliminate nearly all it's problems by only sending out encrypted mails - that is, if after removing the encryption that was applied using it's own private
key, it finds that the result is plaintext, it simply drops the message.
This has some neat and useful properties.
* It eliminates spam. Spammers would have to encrypt each individual
message with the key of the recipient, which is too much hassle.
* It eliminates any possibility of the remailer knowing the content, which
alleiviates him/her of responsibility for that content. * The remailer still operates fine as a mid-chain remailer.
* All recipients need to have keypairs. They are thus at least somewhat
crypto-savvy people, and unlikely to place unreasonable requests on
the remailer or his/her ISP.
The only bad point:
* All recipients need to have key pairs. Thus, a crypto-only remailer can't be a terminal remailer to mailing lists, newsgroups, or individuals without keypairs.

consternation over the key-length reduction to 56 bits, and the unexplained

at IBM (and presumably at NSA). LCA was not then known within IBM (whether it was known inside NSA is an interesting question :-)

Perhaps one could generate the solution, and find a problem which is solved by that solution, but finding a type of problem which humans will always solve one way, and
computers another is the rub.

This is the last time I'm going to respond to you on this
topic. Everyone else understands my point, and there's
a limit to how much effort I'm going to go to correct a
single obtuse individual.
$50 is nothing, of course. Requiring that each message to be encrypted with the final recipient's public key is far
from nothing. Sending 10^5 emails without encryption is trivial. Encrypting 10^5 emails is far from trivial. We're raising the cost to the spammer far more than we're adding to the effort of the remailer operator. You speak of gatewaying - who exactly is going to set up a free gateway to encrypt 10^5 messages, each to a different public key? All that does is shift the cost to the gatewayer; it does not eliminate it. Jim: go back to the genesis of this thread. The discussion was along the lines of "There are
too few remailers. Why?"
Among of the reasons cited are that remailer operators often get shut down by their ISPs or network poviders because of complaints from end recipients of messages -
they get spam, threats, illegal material, etc. It does
not matter that the remailer keeps no logs; the end
recipients mail server does, and that's enough for the
recipient's ISP (or the LEAs) to take action.
This situation not only gets remailers shut down; it
discourages people from starting them in the first place. My proposal makes using the remailer for
spam economically prohibitive, and ensures that
the only recipients are crypto-aware types, who are
far less likely to misunderstand what's going on
than J. Random Luser.
There you go again... Please read the thread. The goal
is not to 'stop spammers'. It's to 'Stop actions against remailers, some of which are caused by their misuse as spam conduits'. Preventing spam from exiting the remailers achieves that goal. That's true. The use of doomed (since they'll be dropped before they leave the network) spam messages as cover traffic is something that occured to me as I wrote the letter. It is a nice side effect of my proposal, as
long as spammers continue to send doomed spam into the
Same as it always was.
No Jim, I'm not talking about decreasing the load due to spam. I'm talking about making life easier for remailer operators. In the long run, it'll reduce spam as well, since spammers will learn not to include remailers which send
only encrypted mail in their remailer chains. A remailer operator can operate his remailer in any way he or she wants, and so long as they publish their policies
and adhere to them, there is no basis for anyone to criticize them (this is a thing called 'freedom').
Jim: I think I'm beginning to appreciate the depth of your lack of comprehension.
Remailers do not encrypt anything. All the encryption steps are done by the originator of the message - successively encrypting the message with public
key of the recipient (an optional step in current
remailers), and then by the public key of each remailer in the chain working back to the originator.
Each remailer decrypts the message with it's private key,
All it knows is to send the inner contents on to the next remailer in the chain, or to the final recipient. This is how remailer chaining works today.
The only change I propose is that, if after applying it's
own public key to decrypt a message, the remailer notices
that the decrypted material does not match one of the well
known formats for encrypted messages (ie, it is likely
plaintext), that it drop the message. I won't discuss the
recognition algorithm here, since I have already done so
and others have even published sample code. It can be done.

To expand on this, in the early years, access was only for people doing
DoD funded work - either defense contractors, or universities with DoD
funding. It was even argued that non work-related email was forbidden
(and the SF-Lovers Digest - the first large mailing list - existed only
sub-rosa for it's early years). Usenet was a bit later - early to mid-80's I think.
But there were a lot of earlier problems...
In those days, there were no ISPs. You got access through a university or
a contractor, or not at all. Around 1990, email portals were permitted to
some of the large commercial BBS systems - BIX, Delphi, Compuserve,
etc - later Usenet was also gatewayed (I date the 'death of the net' to
this period). At this time, the typical user used a terminal emulation program (vt100)
to dial into a Unix box, and then used Unix CLI tools to access net
services from that point. If you wanted to get something from the
Unix box to your PC, you used sneakernet or Kermit.
Finally, NSF and DARPA got out of the net, and commercial backbone providers took over. ISPs started to appear. However, the net was still hard to use, and very much a geek's toy. If
you doubt this, consider that until the early 90's, all access was still via command line interfaces - rn for news, ftp for file transfer,
telnet for remote access,  a variety of packages for mail (all flat text). Even if you owned a PC, you still had to buy and set up a
modem, buy and install a TCP stack (not included in DOS or
Windows), and obtain some initial tools (ftp clients most critically -
with ftp you could bootstrap yourself).
It was not until the WWW that 'the lights came on' and suddenly
the net was something that non-geeks could expect to use and
navigate effectively.

My Data, Mine to Keep Private
By LINDA R. MONK
  WASHINGTON -- I was one of those paranoid Americans
who chose not to answer all questions on the long form of
the 2000 census. My husband and I decided that the
government did not need to know, or had other ways of
finding out, what time we left for work, how much our
mortgage payment was or the amount of our income that came
from wages. We were willing to risk the $100 fine to take a
stand for individual privacy in an increasingly nosy and
automated age.
Editorial writers across the nation chided people like us
for being so silly, insisting that only right-wing nuts with
delusions of jackbooted federal invaders could possibly
object to the census. Think of all the poor women who need
day care and disabled people who depend on public
transportation, we were told. And don't listen to the
warnings of Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader -
they're just another Republican ploy to get a low count on
the census.
Now, however, my concerns don't appear quite so
ridiculous. The Congressional Budget Office, with the
surprising help of some Congressional Republicans, is
angling to get its hands on Census Bureau files. The budget
office wants to create a "linked data set" on individuals -
using information from the Internal Revenue Service, Social
Security Administration and Census Bureau surveys - to help
it evaluate proposed reforms in Medicare and Social
Under current law, census data on individuals can be used
only to benefit the Census Bureau, which has balked at
turning over files to the budget office without greater
assurances of individual privacy. However, the Congressional
number crunchers are not taking no for an answer.
Republicans may tack an amendment allowing Congress access
to census data onto an appropriations bill before Congress
adjourns for the elections.
The records the budget office wants are not themselves from
the 2000 Census; they are voluntary responses to monthly
surveys, with confidentiality promised. Forcing the bureau
to give them up would set a disturbing precedent. Commerce
Secretary Norman Mineta, who supervises the Census Bureau,
warned Congress this month that amending the census law
would "seriously compromise" the department's ability to
safeguard taxpayers' privacy and "to assure continued high
response rates of the American public to census surveys."
Chip Walker, a spokesman for Representative Dan Miller, a
Florida Republican who chairs the House subcommittee on the
census, sees no problem with congressional access to census
data. "The Census Bureau is the government, and Congress is

Well, that's exactly what I'm afraid of. It's not surprising
that a federal agency that stockpiles information would be
raided by other federal agencies. If Congress changes the
census law, the government will be well on its way to

Nathan, have you ever actually looked at socialized medicine? It's fine for some things, but not for others. Illnessess which can be cured and which curing will return a person to productive labour get treated - after a while. Illnessess which strike late in life and/or
require expensive treatment get much shorter shrift. Britain's NHS record on cancer treatment is a national disgrace. Why do you think Austin Power's teeth were a running joke? The state of British (ie, socialized NHS) dentistry  lags *far* behind the US, especially in the area of orthodontics.
Canadians like their socialized system, but any Canadian who gets sick knows that (for a price) they can get faster, better treatment in the US. There are more MRI machines in single US cities than in all of Canada, and the waiting lists up there can outlast an Albertan winter.
The sad truth is that cost of the best medical care has exceeded the ability of the average person to afford it. (When I say 'average' I mean the arithmetic mean of incomes, so robbing the rich to treat the poor still won't get everyone the best possible care). Regardless of how we choose to finance it, there will remain many people whose lives could have been improved by treatments which were not performed due to reasons of cost.
Once you recognize that medical care *must* be rationed, the question
is how, and by who. The majority of the subscribers to this list are
anarcho-capitalists and/or libertarians, and abhor any taking by force.
Your socialist outlook is very much a minority viewpoint, and I don't
think you're going to change anyones mind.
The solution to this problem is not to propose different ways to slice up the too-small pie - it's to expand the pie. The greater the
wealth, the more people who can afford good care. People who are
responsible for their own welfare (and enslaved to the welfare of others) have the best chance of acheiving wealth.

Since the duties of this ISTAC appear to include advising BXA

That page also has links to minutes from the public parts of meetings, (which are held in DC) The next ISTAC meeting is November 15 &16,
and is partially open to the public.
Here's some cut&paste text
                          WHAT ARE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES?
                      Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) advise the
Department of Commerce
                      on the technical parameters for export controls
applicable to dual-use
                      commodities and technology and on the administration
of those controls.
                      The TACs are composed of representatives from industry
and Government
                      representing diverse points of view on the concerns of
the exporting
                      community. Industry representatives are selected from
firms producing a
                      broad range of goods, technologies, and software
presently controlled for
                      national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation,
and short supply reasons
                      or that are proposed for such controls, balanced to
the extent possible among
                      large and small firms.                           HOW ARE MEMBERS CHOSEN?
                      TAC members are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce
and serve terms
                      of not more than four consecutive years. The
membership reflects the
                      Department's commitment to attaining balance and
diversity. TAC members
                      must obtain secret-level clearances prior to
appointment. These clearances
                      are necessary so that members can be permitted access
to relevant classified
                      information needed in formulating recommendations to
the Department of
                      Commerce. Each TAC meets approximately 4 times per
year. Members of the
                      TACs will not be compensated for their services.                           HOW MANY TACS ARE THERE, AND WHAT DO THEY DO?
                      The following is a list of TACs that currently advise
BXA, along with a
                      short summary of each TAC's issue areas. You can

Press Release
SOURCE: RSA Security Inc.
RSA Security Releases RSA Encryption Algorithm into Public Domain
'c = m(e) mod n' Made Available Two Weeks Early
BEDFORD, Mass., Sept. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- RSA® Security
Inc. (Nasdaq: RSAS - news) today announced it has released the
RSA public key encryption algorithm into the public domain,
allowing anyone to create products that incorporate their own
implementation of the algorithm. This means that RSA Security has
waived its rights to enforce the patent for any development
activities that include the RSA algorithm occurring after
September 6, 2000.
Represented by the equation "c = m(e) mod n," the RSA algorithm
is widely considered the standard for encryption and the core
technology that secures the vast majority of the e-business
conducted on the Internet. The U.S. patent for the RSA algorithm
( "Cryptographic Communications System And Method")
was issued to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on
September 20, 1983, licensed exclusively to RSA Security and
expires on September 20, 2000.
"So much misinformation has been spread recently regarding the
expiration of the RSA algorithm patent that we wanted to create
an opportunity to state the facts," said Art Coviello, chief
executive officer of RSA Security. "RSA Security's
commercialization of the RSA patent helped create an entire
industry of highly secure, interoperable products that are the
foundation of the worldwide online economy.  Releasing the RSA
algorithm into the public domain now is a symbolic next step in
the evolution of this market, as we believe it will cement the
position of RSA encryption as the standard in all categories of
wired and wireless applications and devices. RSA Security intends
to continue to offer the world's premier implementation of the
RSA algorithm and all other relevant encryption technologies in
our RSA BSAFE® software solutions and we remain confident in
our leadership in the encryption market."
For nearly two decades, more than 800 companies spanning a range
of global industries have turned to RSA Security as a trusted,
strategic partner that can provide the proven, time-tested
encryption implementations and resources designed to speed time
to market. These companies, including nearly 200 so far in 2000,
rely on RSA BSAFE® security software for its encryption
implementation and value-added services for a broad range of B2B,
B2C and wireless applications.
During the past 17 years, RSA Security has incorporated the
concepts represented by the RSA algorithm into its RSA BSAFE
cryptographic software. The company has made continuous
enhancements to the way the algorithm has been implemented,
including a number of performance improvements and optimizations,
not reflected in the original patent, for a wide range of
software applications, operating systems and chip designs. RSA
Security also is an industry leader in developing standards on
the robust application of encryption technologies for solving
real-world problems. These core standards, known as the Public
Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), form the underpinnings of
today's most widely used communication methods.
In recent years, encryption technology has taken on an entirely
new level of importance in the world of business and consumer
technology, and RSA Security continues to be a leader in the
industry. Once the province of a small group of technologists and
mathematicians, new developments have raised the profile of
encryption among a broad range of audiences. Moving forward,
electronic signature legislation, export regulation and the
pending selection of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) all
will contribute significantly to encryption playing a key role in
the further expansion of e-commerce initiatives for B2B, B2C and
extended enterprise applications.

Doctors, lawyers, teachers... All three groups share a certain property:
They have effective control over who may practice their profession. In
their own self-interest, they act to stifle competition. There are, of
weasel words to justify this: 'maintaining standards' being the most common ones.
Teacher's unions rail against merit pay and vouchers, which would provide
some notion of a competitive market in education. The unions insist on a seniority system. They even attempt to ban volunteer part-time teachers
on 'quality' grounds, so you can't go in and give a computer class if
you wanted to, since you don't have a teaching degree.
Similar points can be made about doctors, and the use of IANAL indicates

Only rulers are worse. Imagine if the software business were like this - that the programmers of the late 40's had formed an American Programmers Association, and it was unlawful for anyone without APA certification to write code for money. Ditto for using software not blessed by the APA.

I try to remember what it was like when I was a kid but it's
really difficult; the world has changed so much since
then. I found a paper book the other day that described the
rise and fall of something called the "Internet". It started
out with people putting up links on computers so that they
could follow the link and read things on other computers for
free. After it got to be popular, companies started to
create machines with lots of links that you could search to
find things of interest. But someone put up a link to
something illegal and got sued and had their machine shut
down. This happened a few times and people started to take
the links off their machines. The search engine companies
were the first to go and without them, you couldn't find
anything. Eventually no one put up links anymore because the
legal risk was too great. The important thing is that it
reduced terrorism. I'm not sure how it could have worked
anyway. Anything I write on my computer or any music I
create gets stored by Word.NET and Music.NET in encrypted
formats to protect my privacy. No one but me, Microsoft.NET
and the National Corporation can read or hear my stuff even
if they could link to it.
I shouldn't admit it, but sometimes I go to certain places
and speak to the subversives. I know its wrong but their
warped views on things have some kind of morbid
fascination. For example, I spoke to someone who claimed to
be a historian the other day. She had courage all right,
admitting to an illegal activity like that. I hadn't
understood why it was illegal until she explained. History,
she told me, gives you context. You can compare today with
some time in the past; ask questions like, "are people
better off", "look at the different forms of doing
business", "compare corporate records or the rights of
citizens" (I think she meant employees).

Can you document this claim of the existance of 'help fields' in
Netscape? I am (to put it mildly) astonished by this claim, and
more than a little skeptical. I was aware of the Workfactor
Reduction field in the export 'aka International' version of Lotus Notes
(which this 'help field' seems identical to), but was not aware
of it being included in any other application.
If you can document this, I'm seriously interested in following up.

I don't accept this. You should be able to: generate traffic dumps pointing to the 'help field', and showing where it fits within the SSL
specifications. This is hardly rocket science.  There is no need to
compromise anyone whatsoever. Put forward the evidence, so we
can independently confirm it.
This sort of thing happens every year or two on this list. Someone
makes a claim which, if true, has interesting and/or important
implications. However, the nature of the claim is one which is
quite capable of verification. The onus is placed on the claiment
to 'put up or shut up'. Usually, they shut up. Examples of
such claims include:
* PGP has a secret backdoor. (OK: Here's the source: Where is it?)
* gcc is hacked to stick secret backdoors into PGP. (OK: Here's the source:
Where is it?)
* All gcc binaries will stick the PGP hacking code into gcc when compiling
     (Here's a dump: show us.)
* Emily Dickinson hid her boyfriends initials in her poems. So I call upon you: Put up or Shut up.
Huh? "Doesn't talk about it"? It was announced with fanfare at the RSA Data Security conference a few years ago. There were press
releases. It was widely discussed on this list. I invented the term

Well, it could mean that they want to use Web features available in later versions but not in earlier ones. Or maybe there are known security holes in earlier editions. Wells Fargo has actually been ahead of the curve at times: they were one of the first sites to
require 128 bit encryption.
Is it after BXA? Bruce notes that the stories are all at least two years
which would place them in very early 1997 at latest. I can't remember when
the switch took place. Of course, if LG was doing this (and I have no real
doubt that the NSA might try), it's excreable, but what is the relevance to
products today? He can no longer seriously threaten to hold up export.
Actually, I know of at least one other case where a major exec at a
crypto company threw NSA people out on their ears after they offered to write some software to help with a project.
I think you're confusing two different types of subversion.
1. Company policy based subversion.
This is the type where word comes down from above to put in 'helper
fields', etc. I can't see this happening in any company which was not
simply a LEA front (such as Crypto-AG). The liability would be simply
too great, the exposure too likely. This would require a large number
employees and former employees to know, yet keep their mouths shut. When exposed, the officers of the company would be subject
to criminal fraud and conspiracy charges, as well a variety of civil
suits. It's simply a non-starter. Lew Giles can make as many pleas
as he wishes; but I don't think he'll get many results.
2. Individual treachery.
This type involves corrupting one or more engineers, whether via money,
threats, or misplaced appeals to patriotism. This is more likely to succeed in the short term than type 1, but is very fragile for several reasons familiar to anyone who has done commercial software development.
* Peer code reviews mean that many eyes look at the code.
* Employee turnover in the field is high - 30-50% year. Thus, bugs
  inserted by earlier compromised employees are unlikely to
  last through many release cycles, as new employees come in
  and say 'Oops - Joe forgot to init the PRNG properly - lets fix
  that!'
* Source code management systems make it very difficult to a single
  actor to monkey with code secretly, and even harder to cover his
  tracks. Actually, it's pretty clear what happened with most of those cases
where companies were allowed to ship strong crypto overseas
before most of the restrictions were lifted. They all involved products
where at least one party of the communications was a large
organization or company which was subject to, and could be counted
on complying with, sub poenas and court orders. Thus the authorities
had another route by which to acquire content in which they were
interested. I have little doubt that government organizations have attempted to
subvert commercial crypto at various times in various ways. However,
the 'help fields' you describe are simply implausible in open protocols
such as SSL. Again, I ask you to point to the evidence. I and others
have already run the searches you suggested and come up dry. Where
are the URLs?
As it stands, you are spreading FUD. Peter Trei

My comments on code reviews is based on the practice at my current employer. When upper management supports the practice, and

You may be a lawyer, but I'm a cryptographic software engineer. Cleansing disks and memory of keys and plaintext isn't done
to prevent some hypothetical court from looking at evidence;
there are good, legally unremarkable reasons to do so, which
are regarded as good hygiene and 'best practice' in the You've seen the posts on the 'sircam' virus, haven't you? All
kinds of private documents flying around the world due to
some asshole who gets egoboo out of smashing things.
Keeping your documents encrypted helps protect against
this kind of illegal surveillance. Backing them up on other computers (encrypted or otherwise) prevents them from being lost to a destructive virus. This is often easier than
making copies on removable media.
Running wipe programs such as BCwipe is also best
practice - I've seen attacks which were based on searching swap files, end-of-file slack space, and unused blocks for 'interesting' data - whether keys (which can be recognized by their low redundancy) or passphrases (look
for a printable string on it's own among a sea of binary data as the first cut).
Did you know that Windows NT includes a switch to zeroize
the swap file on system shutdown? Does Microsoft also
need the 'cautionary note' you refer to above? (Yes, they
did the right thing at least once :-).
As one of the more experienced cryptoengineers at my
company, I often wind up training new hires in the ways
writing sensitive security software differs from ordinary
programming. One of the most important lessons I impart
is the necessity of zeroizing all sensitive data as soon
as it's need has passed. The programmers also need
to be very aware of how procedure calls use the stack,
how the heap works, and the implications of garbage
collection, disk and memory defragmentation.
Destroying sensitive data is part of doing the job right, in
a professional, 'best practice' manner.

than others. In 1990, one ad showed smiling children
playing with their 'Happy Fun Balls'. At the end, the
ad ran a disclaimer (American products often come
with ludicrously detailed warnings and disclaimers, due
to our corrupt legal system). It read:
Happy FUN BALL!
-only $14.95-      Warning: Pregnant women, the elderly and children under 10 should avoid
prolonged exposure to Happy Fun Ball.      Caution: Happy Fun Ball may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds.      Happy Fun Ball Contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to
rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.      Do not use Happy Fun Ball on concrete.
Discontinue use of Happy Fun Ball if any of the following occurs:      Itching      Vertigo      Dizziness      Tingling in extremities      Loss of balance or coordination      Slurred speech      Temporary blindness      Profuse sweating      Heart palpitations      If Happy Fun Ball begins to smoke, get away immediately. Seek shelter
and cover head.      Happy Fun Ball may stick to certain types of skin.      When not in use, Happy Fun Ball should be returned to its special
container and kept under refrigeration...      Failure to do so relieves the makers of Happy Fun Ball, Wacky Products
Incorporated, and its parent company Global Chemical
Unlimited, of any and all liability.      Ingredients of Happy Fun Ball include an unknown glowing substance
which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.      Happy Fun Ball has been shipped to our troops in Saudi Arabia and is
also being dropped by our warplanes on Iraq.      Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.      Happy Fun Ball comes with a lifetime guarantee.      Happy Fun Ball

I'll second this - the early 40 bit SSL cracks, and the RSA Symmetric
operated to force acknowledgement that 40 and 56 bit keylengths were simply
inadequate. I was particularly steamed by some Clinton appointee claiming with a straight face that a DES cracker could not be built because "it would
melt down". The success of the challenges created 'facts on the ground'
which could not be hand-waved away by government officials, and meant
that customers started to insist on something better. BTW, the distributed.net folks are still cranking at 64 bit RC5. They
have now searched 54% of the keyspace in 1,386 days. One thing I'd like to see done with these huge distributed computers
is to factor moduli, such as those in the RSA Factoring Challenges
(the prizes are substantial), A major bottleneck at this point is the
matrix reduction step. If a method could be found to run this in parallel,
then distributed factoring would be greatly eased.

  He was just having lunch in Ybor City when a surveillance
camera captured his image. Weeks later, the police show up.
By AMY HERDY
St. Petersburg Times, published August 8, 2001
   He was just having lunch in Ybor City when a surveillance
camera captured his image. Weeks later, the police show up.
TAMPA -- Rob Milliron has never married. He has never had
kids, never been to Oklahoma.
   Yet three Tampa police officers went to Milliron's
construction job site Monday and asked him whether he was
wanted in Oklahoma for child neglect.
   It seems that his face wound up on a surveillance camera
in Ybor City. News cameras captured that image. A woman in
Tulsa saw his picture in U.S. News and World Report and
called Tampa police.
   She said the man in the photo was her ex-husband and was
wanted on felony child neglect charges.
   Turns out they had the wrong man. But the experience has
turned Milliron into a vocal critic of the controversial
surveillance system.
   "From that picture, I was identified as a wanted person,"
said Milliron, 32, whose only previous brush with the law
involved a marijuana possession charge when he was 19.
   The surveillance system uses software called Face-It and
is linked to 36 cameras throughout the Centro Ybor
entertainment complex and along E Seventh Avenue. Images
taken from the cameras are compared with a data base that
includes wanted felons and sexual offenders.
   If the image is a match, officers are dispatched to
question the person. But in this case it wasn't the system
that flagged Milliron, but simply a woman who saw his
picture with a news story.
   The plainclothes detective, accompanied by two uniformed
officers, had a copy of the magazine, folded open to the
page with Milliron's photo.
   After producing identification, answering the detective's
questions and enduring curious stares and inquiries from his
construction co-workers, a mortified Milliron went home.
   "He was absolutely horrified," said Cheryl Toole, 32,
Milliron's girlfriend of nine years.
   "He said, "I was surrounded by the police today,' " Toole
recalled. "We were worried they'd come to our home in the
middle of the night."
   Equally upsetting, Milliron said, was the fact that
beneath his photo in the magazine, a headline read, "You
Can't Hide Those Lying Eyes in Tampa."
   "It made me out to be a criminal," he said.
   Tampa police Detective Bill Todd, who took the call from
the Tulsa woman and interviewed Milliron, said Milliron did
not seem upset.
   "He was laughing about it," said Todd, who spearheaded
the software project that captured Milliron's image.
   Milliron's photograph was captured in June while he was
on a lunch break in Ybor City.
   He didn't know it at the time, but the Police Department
used his photo to demonstrate the system to local news
   The software costs $30,000, but is on loan for a year by
its owner, Visionics Corp. of New Jersey, while the
department decides whether to purchase it.
   Milliron's photo ran in the St. Petersburg Times June
30. A caption under the photo read, "The man in this image
was not identified as wanted."
   The Times later sold the photo to U.S. News and World
   The software system has sparked controversy
nationwide. Protesters say the "spy cameras" intrude on
citizens' privacy. Mayor Dick Greco, however, has said the
system is no more intrusive than the cameras found in banks
and shopping malls.
   Milliron, who says he plans to retain an attorney, hopes
the software system will be removed.
   "I don't think it's right," he said. "They made me feel
like a criminal."

[lots of good rant deleted]
      [even more good rant deleted]
Aimee, who is somewhat of a newcomer to our list, is groping towards
an idea which seems to hold the minds of many contributors; that the
contents of our private data are as personal, and should be as inviolate,
as the contents of our heads. To those of us to whom the use of computers is as natural as breathing,
our data are as much a part of us as our memories, and we instinctively feel they should be just as intimately held. We now use computers as extensions of our minds - a vast store of
knowledge, ideas, and abilities. This ability simply did not exist at the
time the Constitution was written, and as computers grew out of
accounting equipment, their data came to be treated as 'papers'
rather than 'memories'.
This disjuncture between how we feel about our private data, and
how the powers that be treat it, is one basis for a major thread of discussion on cypherpunks and other lists - how one can store one's own personal data in a way which makes it accessible to oneself, and only to oneself.
Being forced to turn over one's most intimate thoughts knownlege, and plans, simply because they are outside of one' skull, is a rape of the mind, and a violation of the intent of the Fifth Amendment.

Microsoft's forte is making money. They do this by spending hugely on
what people think they want (ease of use), and not wasting resources on
things which do not impact market share. If MS ever decided that they were losing money due to poor security, they would get good at it, fast. How many fewer copies of WinXP will
they sell due to Code Red I, II, and III? Not many. A few (a very few) sysadmins may decide to go with Apache instead of IIS. It's not like
many home or corporate users are going to switch to Linux purely
due to security issues.
I hate to say this, but until software developers are held (at least at the
corporate level) in some way liable for their failures, there will be little
or no improvement in the situation. I'm aware of exactly two datapoints - Skipjack (which wasn't good enough
that anyone wanted to use it), and the recent 'dual counter mode' snafu.
That's not enough to draw broad conclusions.
MS makes crap because their customers buy it. If the customers
(or their insurers) insisted on security, MS would do better. (BTW, MS's security rep is now so bad, that I know of security experts who would not work for them, due to the damage it would do to their reputations).
I occasionally see the argument that NSA can't retain people due
to the much higher salaries, etc, in the public sector. While I have
no doubt that this is partially true, there are plenty of very good
people who find that the non-tangible benefits - patriotism, a sense
that one's work is important, that one is a trusted member of
the inner circle and privy to secret knowledge - are more than enough to make up for a civil service paycheck. No one should discount these factors just because they don't move them Peter Trei

If it's a fake, it's a damn subtle one. I've read the transcript, but not
the tape. The contents do not unequivocally prove UBL to be behind the
9/11 attacks, but it's a very reasonable inference. It does clearly show that UBL claiming to have foreknowledge of the attacks. If you want to go beyond what I consider reasonable, you could argue that UBL is taking
credit for someone else's work.
I find it difficult to believe that someone would go to the trouble of producing a fake,  and not use it to show UBL categorically taking
responsibility for the crime.
I'm inclined to believe the tapes reality.
Facial geometry would be an interesting test. The folks claiming to be
able to spot baddies by facial recognition systems could do an interesting
demo - feeding known pictures of UBL into their system to build a profile,
then seeing the the UBL on the tape matches. I gather the sound is pretty
poor, so voiceprints may not be doable.
Near-undetectable? I don't think so. Convincing human faces are just about the hardest thing to do in CGI animation. Humans are hardwired to recognize and differentiate between faces, and we're very sensitive to fakes. Look at Pixar's efforts, or the recent video game based movie (Final Fantasy???) No one is going to watch the humans in either of those for more than a few seconds without realizing that they are not real. CGI humans are still like dancing
bears - which are applauded not because they dance well, but
because the dance at all. Perhaps, but I'll take the position it's real until more evidence appears
to the contrary.

Chaining is the sender's problem.

First I've heard that. Frankly, I'm suprised. One solution, which I've long advocated, is for the remailer to drop mail
which has an unencrypted body after it's applied it's decryption key. Provided this is an announced policy, substantially increases the protection of the mail and the remop. It does mean that only people
capable of using encryption can receive mail via the remailer, but
that's probably a *good* thing.

Ryan suggested earlier that the Ipaq with Fireball isn't up to the task.
I don't think this is correct. I point you to
in which some Stanford students produce a wireless ipaq2ipaq
VoIP system. Biggest problem is that it's simplex, not because
of cpu limitations but rather that the Compaq HW can listen or
make noise, but not both simultaneously. Using a headset which
interfaces through the expansion port might enable you to avoid this problem (and the BT headset could also offload the
codec). A 206 MHz Ipaq would, I think have sufficient HP to do the crypto.
I've toyed with the idea of porting SpeakFreely to Ipaq, but have
not actually done anything at this point.
I've x-posted to coderpunks, since that group is more germane.

It's a fact that there is a much larger developer community for the Palm

I realize that this is *slightly* simplistic, but comparing 2 (preferably 3 or more) copies of the data with different watermark contents should quickly reveal where and what constitutes the watermarking.
Of course, there are methods to make this more onerous - MACing the watermarked data for one - but nothing a determined counterfeiter couldn't work around. It only takes one, after all.
I'm currently working my way through Schneier's 'Secrets and Lies'. He has one comment I like to the effect that trying to make data not be copyable is a task on a par with trying to make water not be wet.

@_subject: Secure Erasing is actually harder than that... 
I don't think they're disinfo, but I suspect they are dated. Also, for highly sensitive data, the secure wiping standards generally
involve liberal use of thermite.
The problem lies in the gap between what disk manufacturers are willing to spend on disk r/w mechanisms,  and what an attacker is able to spend.
If your threat model does not include seizure (or a secret swap-out) of the hard drive, then yes, a single overwrite with random data will protect you pretty well. If something could  be done to use the existing head mechanisms to reliably recover over-written data, then the HD manufacturers would be  using it to boost capacity.
It's when your opponent can pull out the platters, and either
put them in a drive with better heads, or into an AFM rig, that
the remanent data becomes interesting. How many overwrites it takes to securly delete varies according
to several factors, including:
* How many random writes it takes to make the analog flux
levels irrecoverable.
* How much jitter there is in the drive - the likely hood that a given write of a sector will be a little closer or further from the
center of the track, measured radially (I suspect that this is
affected by termperature and the most recent head movement)
* How accurate the drive is in speed and time - ie, if a given bit
is written slightly earlier or later along the track than it was the
previous time. Again, temperature may be an important factor.
I would expect that as disks become denser, the head mechanisms
also become more precise, and the recover problem gets harder.
It's my vague recollection that some of the newer storage technologies
(CD-RWs, MOs, etc) use preformatted pits to store the data bits. Its
possible that for these technologies, the number of overwrites required to make data irrecoverable is considerably lower, but that's
outside my area of expertise.

Central heating did not develop until well after

the terminology is different. When I moved to Britain in the late 60's, central
heating was still rare enough that it was noted in real estate listings. The Brits and other Europeans
developed some rather odd devices to retrofit older
1. The Geyser (alt pro: geezer). A box attached to
the wall in or near a shower, which provided instant
hot water. Some were gas powered (in which case
a balanced flue was fitted through a hole in the wall
to the outside). Some were electric. Having several hundred watts of electricity in intimate contact with the water and metal piping of the shower was rather nervous making (saw many still in use in Scotland this summer).
2. The 'storage heater'. The CEGB (central electricity generating board) rates were far lower at night
than during the day or evening. A storage heater
was a metal box, typically 4' wide, 2.5 ft high, and about a foot deep, filled with electric elements
and firebrick. During the night, the bricks would be
heated electrically. By morning the box was a serious burn hazard, and radiating heat for the rest of the day as it slowly cooled. At my boarding school, we used to toss matches on the top of one and make bets as to which would be the first to light.

You are confusing two distinct issues: Form and Content.
On the Content side, you are essentially correct. I and many others
find the beliefs you espouse on physics, law, and mathematics idiosyncratic,  peculiar, and often just plain wrong. However, I think we'd all agree that you are free to post them. The list IS an anarchy
in that sense.
However, as to Form, you're mistaken. Cypherpunks is NOT an anarchy - it's a forum for communication. 'Communication'  shares roots with  'Common' and 'Community' . More than one party is involved. For effective communication to occur,  certain agreed (often tacitly or by default) protocols and standards are adhered to by the parties (note the plural) wishing to communicate.
This is where you are failing ('What we have here is a failure to
communicate' :-)
To be specific, your methods of citation of outside sources are
both burdensome and ineffective.
Consider a very recent example. This morning, you posted an

a screen saying 'Baen Free LIbrary', along with a broken

zero, zip, nada to the usefullness of  your post, contains
no link, and takes up space. Don't you check your messages before you send them?
This is (a) ineffective, since you don't tell us *what* Baen
is doing which is interesting, and (b) burdensome, since you
tagged on a totally useless attachment. You tagged it on to
every single copy received by list members.
A couple questions:
1. If by expending one minute of your own time, you can save *each* of your (several hundred) recipients a minute of their's, is this an unreasonable burden to ask of you? You're asking hundreds of people to consider your

the rhetoric seems to be on the level of 'this is just soooo creepy'. It's
worth remembering that the boundary of what's acceptable moves - back
in the 60's Britain banned cornea transplants from cadavers, essentially
for creepyness reasons (since repealed).
When cloning has a high success rate, and embryos which are going to
have problems after birth can be identified and culled at an early stage,
then I have no problem with human cloning.  Until then, I'd rather people
did not try it (though, unlike the State, I would not stop them).

EU-Spy     /WRD/
  MP announces plans for a European intelligence service
Berlin, July 5, IRNA -- The European Union plans to create a European
intelligence service, in an effort to counter the American economic
espionage program 'Echelon', a deputy of the European Parliament was
quoted saying Thursday in the German daily junge Welt.
   The German member of the European Parliament, Ilka Schroeder of
the Green Party, referred to the latest report by the espionage
committee, calling for the formation of a European intelligence
service to protect European industries against US espionage.
   "It's hypocritical for the parliament to criticize the US Echelon
surveillance techniques, while there are plans in work to promote
a European secret service," Schroeder blasted the latest initiative.
   A recent report by a European parliamentary committee confirmed the
existence of a controversial worldwide espionage network 'Echelon'
which has caused between Dlrs 13 and 145 billion in financial
damages to European companies.
   The study, presenting evidence that intelligence services from
the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain are part
of 'Echelon', called on European firms to guard themselves from this
ultra-modern form of economic espionage.
   The United States had in the past repeatedly denied the existence
of 'Echelon' which is reportedly capable of eavesdropping on every
single telephone call, radio transmission, fax or e-mail message
around the world.
   US officials had refused to meet with a visiting European
parliamentary delegation a few weeks ago, wanting information on
   A member of the EU parliamentary committee, Gerhard Schmid said the
evidence, consisting of photos, statements by intelligence officials
working on the project and the results of internet research-proved
conclusively and without a doubt that this was in fact the case.
   "Companies outside Europe getting hold of this information might
gain huge advantages," Schmid added.
   The study suggested advanced coding techniques for companies when
transmitting confidential messages.
    Schmid also referred to the close cooperation between the
intelligence services of the US and EU member Great Britain, saying it
might have serious repercussions for the EU's common foreign and
security policies if the issue was not discussed.
   The worldwide espionage installations of 'Echelon', were created
in 1947 and initially used for military purposes.

Dot-commers to blame for anti-capitalist
violence, says WTO boss
By Andrew Orlowski
Posted: 06/07/2001 at 22:12 GMT
"Dot com types" are to blame for the violence at recent
gatherings of the World Trade Organisation, according to WTO
director general Mike Moore.
Moore made his remarks in Geneva, in an appeal for citizens
groups (NGOs) to distance themselves from "masked
stone-throwers who claim to want more transparency,
anti-globalization dot.com-types who trot out slogans that
are trite, shallow and superficial," he said.
Which came as news to us. We thought "dot com" types were
too busy braying into mobile phones and snorting enormous
quantities of Bolivian marching powder as they vandalised a
communication infrastructure created at great public expense
for research purposes, with marketing plans that would get a
six year old suspended from kindergarten for frivolity.
They'd certainly be the last group we'd suspect of
complaining about capitalism.
"Critics, who are not all mad or bad, frequently say we have
too much power," Moore conceded generously.
Moore then went on to propose a contract demanding
"transparency from NGOs as to their membership, their
finances, their rules of decision-making," which most
citizens groups will find deliciously ironic.
Alas, we suspect, he was being serious.

Actually, there's a curious legal precedent which might
help the satellite holders. One of the NASA probes (perhaps
the atmospheric probe to Jupiter? Did we have a Venus probe?)
had an instrument window made of diamond. The fairly large diamond used drew considerable import duty when it was brought into the US, but that duty was returned after the launch, since the diamond had been 're-exported'. This seems to my IANAL logic to set a precedent that an
asset in space is not in the US.
Actually, the USG doesn't give a damn whether it's in the
US, in another country , or neither. If they want to, they'll
tax it. Expatriate US citizens have to pay income tax on foreign earned income to the US (I think only the US, Egypt,
and the Phillipines do this). Even if you give up your US
citizenship, the IRS expects to tax you for a further 10 years
if your net worth is over $350k when you vacate your
US citizenship.
If you don't pay up, they might not be able to extradite you if you're now a foreigner, but they'll go after your assets in the US, or arrest you if you set foot on US soil.

Yes, this is correct. If you make a *sound* recording
in this state, all the parties present have to consent
(and, I think, consent). The issue is not that a recording was made, but that it was made
No such limitation exists on video recordings.
[FWIW, my opinion is that a police officer interacting
in his official capacity with a private citizen is *always"
in public, and has no reasonable expectation of privacy. The court refused arguments based on this,
saying that the law did not provide an 'in public' exception. I wonder: If you were being questioned by the
police, and told them you did NOT consent to
being recorded, would they then be required to stop recording?]
Here's the relevant state law:
[start quote]
Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 272 , ' 99 (1999): It is a crime to record any conversation, whether oral or wire, without the consent of all parties in Massachusetts. The
penalty for violating the law is a fine of up to $10,000 and a jail sentence of up to five years.

With high-powered lasers, one of the important destructive mechanisms is
blast - the outer layer of the illuminated object vaporizes, and flies away
the rest of the target. The reactive force of this gives the target a hell
of a kick.
Kicking off strict alignment with it's flight path, or putting a big dent
(or even better a hole) in the side of a missile under several G's of stress
traveling at a high Mach number is not healthy for the missile.
Laser's have problems though - as they heat the air the refractive index
leading to 'blooming' or beam expansion. At too high a power density they
also ionize the air, which makes it effectively opaque. Dust, haze, and
are also problems.
Using *very* short pulses eliminates many of these problems.

It may not be that easy. My understanding (based on various TV programs
broadcast back in the early 90's) is that there is a program called 'NEST',
which stands for something like Nuclear Emergency (mumble) Team,
tasked with dealing with this type of problem.
One protection hinted is that strategically chosen points of transit

detectors for nuclear materials. The thing is, while you can sheild a source to the point where it is not
a hazard, sheilding it to the point of *undetectability* is far harder task.
If you detect even a single gamma ray of a certain frequency, or betas or even alphas of certain energies, you *know* that a certain
isotope produced them. If the detectors note the presence of a certain isotopes, they generate the appropriate alarms.
There are also other detection systems - I've seen X-rays of entire
container trucks which were passing through the Chunnel - illegal immigrants were quite visible inside the container. An attacker's best chance would be to place his weapon in a
container, heavily sheilded, and then to bury that in the middle of
a stack of other containers of heavy shielding in the hold of a
container ship, and plan to detonate it while still on board in a
target harbor.

access to her own work. If many copies exist which are
readable only by her, but not under her control, how can
she be so deprived? (I suppose the court could order her to

Thanks for your response. The 'in his direct or indirect control' bit is the part that got lost in the article.
I hope it was clear that I was not looking for ways to deny a court *access* to a piece of information, but rather using the net (prior to a subpoena) as an way to make  *sequestration* of a piece of info impossible,
by placing copies permanently outside 'his direct or
indirect control'.
I hope you read Mike's 'Oh pointy one' note carefully;
it points out one of the great problems most of us IANAL
have with IAAL types - the confusion of laws and court
action with right and justice, and actions which are
simply unlawful at a given time and place with wrong and injustice.
Laws and courts are or should be an attempt to map
the behaviour of governments to right and justice, but lawyers so often seemed to have been conditioned into thinking they are one and the same, rather than a (very) rough approximation.
[Case to point: Canter and Siegel claiming that there
was nothing wrong with them sending their Green Card
spam, since there was no law against it.]
It's possible - indeed essential - for people to argue
over right and wrong, justice and injustice without regard for what a given legal and court system says;
even a court and legal system which can send Men
With Guns after them. Laws do not define Right and Wrong.

That may be so, but I would have thought that ORBS
could have usurped one of the many types of queries
which DNS permits to package it's reputation data.
I think you  misunderstand SMTP (If not, please
correct me. :-)
If you look at RFC 821, section 3.1, you'll find that the
RCPT TO: command takes only a single address; multiple
addressees are handled by sending multiple RCPT TO: lines,
and waiting for a 250 OK or a 550 Failure response after
each one. My suggestion is that, on a given connection, an
open relay server wait 10 seconds after before issuing a 250
OK response.  This is too short to time out a client, but
slows the process down greatly for messages with multiple
Yes, you couldn't spam your entire company's internal
mail from an open server in this manner, but you
usually would do this by sending to a single address
which runs a mail exploder within the company. Nor
does it protect against spammers sending messages to
hundreds via mailing lists such as cypherpunks. However,
it would permit open relays to exist without them adding
significantly to the spam problem, which is the problem
I am trying to solve.
In my initial letter, I suggested delaying response only
after the second RCPT message, but on second thought, I
think delaying after the first one is ok. For single
messages, you would not be bothered by a 10 second delay.
and it prevents the spammer from opening hundreds to
connections at once to get around the restriction.
I'll admit that was an off-the-cuff remark, and I'd have to think hard to find other ways. OTOH, I'm sure there are many.
I'm not trying to identify spam per se; I'm trying to make the
relay unattractive to spammers, while minimally impacting everyone else. I'm working at the SMTP protocol level, not envelope, headers, or content.
I'm impacting behaviour, not content or header info.

The only RSA Secret Key Challenge known to be under active attack
at this time is RC5-64, by distributed.net. Last night this reached the 50% mark, having tested  9,225,283,403,065,065,472  keys at the time I write this, over 1331 days. The current rate is over 210 Gkeys/sec - they should complete the keyspace in the next 18 months.
See: Way back in the previous millenium, RSA (then Security Dynamics)
issued a series of 'secret key challenges', in which prizes were
offered for decrypting messages encrypted wish RC5 and DES.
I was responsible for getting SDTI to create the challenges, proposing
them to Jim Bidzos to complement the long standing RSA factoring
contests back in 1996. I was mainly interested in demonstrating that 56 bit DES (then the strongest exportable algorithm) was inadequate, and had created a proof-of-principle DES key-cracker  to demonstrate that the goal was achievable. Jim thought this was a good idea, and I was soon collaborating with RSA Labs in the design of the challenges - long before I came to work at SDTI/RSA.
The first challenge (40 bit RC5) fell in 3.5 hours, and was soon followed
by others, leading up to the 3rd DES challenge in 1999, when distributed.net and the EFF combined to brute force a 56 bit DES key in 23 hours.
The success in the attacks on the Secret Key Challenges created facts on the ground exposing the weakness of exportable crypto, and
in my opinion were important in causing the relaxation of US export regulations in early 2000

@_subject: napster: civil disobedience re: copyright laws 
Well, there's one, but it's a bit of a stretch: William Tyndale. He was
burned at the stake for publishing the New Testament in English in 1536, two  years after Henry VIII had made himself the head of the Church of England
with the Act of Supremacy.
It can be reasonably argued that at that time the Crown and Church were
one and the same in England, and an offense against the State Religion
was an offense against the State.
However, it's generally true that burning was reserved for religious
(including witchcraft), the axe for acts against the Crown, and hanging for other criminal cases.
[Just 2 years later, Henry ordered the production of an official translation
into English, known as the "Great Bible"].

Anyone who has worked with GPS knows that the fastest way to

Conqueror of enigma code finally honoured
By Paul Francis
23 June 2001
Alan Turing, the national hero who broke the Nazi's enigma
code and is credited with turning the tide of the World War
Two, is to be honoured with a life-size statue.
The bronze monument, which will be unveiled today, comes
almost 50 years after the brilliant scientist was driven to
suicide by persecution over his homosexuality. Five years after
its inception, the 20,000 pound sterling sculpture of Turing
sitting on a bench holding an apple will be displayed
Manchester's Sackville Park in the city centre.
The mathematical genius became a national hero after his
involvement in World War Two, he also helped invent the
inaugural computer, at Manchester University, but was
persecuted and prosecuted for his homosexuality. He
committed suicide in 1954 by eating a poisoned apple.
Many believe Turing has never been recognised properly for his
outstanding contribution to science. But Glyn Hughes, the
statue's creator, is confident that Turing has finally earned his
rightful place in the history books. Hughes, from Adlington near
Chorley, said: " It's stunningly realistic. I'm sure it will go a dirty
black over time, but it looks wonderful today."

A recent article in the Economist points this out:
% of people who were victim of a crime, once or more, in 1999:
Violent crime:
England & Wales: 3.5%
US: 1.9%
Car theft England & Wales: 2.6%
US: 0.5%
Burglery (including attempts)
England & Wales: 5%
US: 3.8% The article opens:
BRITAIN may have slipped down many world league tables over the
past few decades, but it beats all other rich countries except
Australia in one activity: crime. According to a new victimisation
survey of industrialised nations, people in England and Wales are
at greater risk than anywhere else of having a car stolen. And
apart from Australia, people who live in England and Wales are at
greater risk of being assaulted, robbed, sexually attacked and
having their homes burgled than are people in any other rich

Now, the murder rate in the US *is* substantially higher than Britain's, but your overall chances of getting through the day
safely are probably higher in the US.

list members seems inexplicable to you. At the risk of being extremely non-PC, I think I can explain why.
The distribution of murders in the US is very heavily skewed towards
groups which are unlikely to be on the list, or acquainted to people
on the list. In short, there is a large disparity in the murder rates for
white, educated professionals (who make up most the membership of
this list) vs poor blacks or latinos.

find its

Microsoft digital certificate stolen
Verisign issued "virtual notary seal" to computer criminal
                By Bob Sullivan
                      MSNBC
     March 22 Microsoft Corp. issued a warning today to all
its customers that a computer criminal has obtained a
digital certificate with the company's name and
authority. The equivalent of a royal seal, digital
certificates prove software code was written by a particular
company and is safe. Microsoft said the criminal tricked
Verisign Inc. into issuing two of the certificates. The
software giant is warning users to be suspicious of any
program that arrives with a certificate claiming
Microsoft's authority.
     MICROSOFT'S SCOTT CULP said Verisign issued the two
fake certificates accidentally on Jan. 29 and Jan. 30, and
discovered the mistake only recently.  (MSNBC is a
Microsoft-NBC joint venture.)
     Web browsers generally encounter such certificates
when the arrive on a Web site that has an ActiveX control,
which allows dynamic content. Usually, a dialog box pops up
asking the users if they would like to trust the code and
allow it to run on the their machines.
     The fraudulent certificates would indicate to a user
that the code was written by Microsoft and might trick a
victim into allowing the code to run.
     "That's exactly one of the scenarios that pose the
greatest risk," Culp said.       The firm is working on a downloadable solution for the
problem, but it won't be ready for about a week, Culp
said. In the meantime, he urged Web users to be suspicious
of any digital certificate they encounter, suggesting they
check the certificate's details.
     "Anything that says it was issued on 29th and
30th of January is bogus. Do not trust it," Culp said.
HUMAN ERROR?
     Culp blamed the problem on human error inside
Verisign. He said law enforcement is now working with the
company to track the criminal, who apparently was able to
convince Verisign he was a Microsoft employee.
     "This wasn't a failure of technology. It was a failure
of one particular Certificate authority to follow its
procedures," he said.
     Digital certificates are issued by third parties,
called certificate authorities, as a way of virtually
"notarizing" computer code. There are hundreds of
authorities, but Verisign is one of the largest. Each
authority is supposed to follow detailed procedures to
verify the identity of the programmer making a certificate
request.       Verisign did not immediately return phone calls.

Leather or wet clothes may shield most of the body. A wild guess to protect the eyes would be something that puts a transparent conductive material over them - mirror sunglasses, the mylar glasses used for eclipse observations (though you could not see anything else through them :-(), or the conductive, mostly transparent plastic material which is used to package static sensitive electronic components.

@_author: Trei, Peter 
@_subject: Security-by-credential or security-by-inspection 
I've been thinking along these lines myself - Tim got to the post
There are two points I'd like to make.
1. The reasons which are publicly aired for installing the current
'security' regime are (in my considered opinion) NOT the actually reasons.
US airlines insisting on IDs which match tickets has nothing to do with airline security, and everything to do with extracting as
much cash as possible from the public.
Before the Pan Am 800 accident, when people were freeer, there
was a secondary market in airline tickets which the original purchasers could not, for one reason or another, use. If you
bought a non-refundable return ticket, and then could not
use it, you could sell it to someone who did want to travel
on those dates to that location. The price varied, but was
less than the cost to the repurchaser of buying a ticket from
the airline.
Due to the vast cost differential (up to 10:1) between the cost
of a ticket to fly tomorrow, vs the cost of a 'two week advance,
stay Saturday night' Supersaver, it was actually economic for
large corporations to buy a steady supply of Supersavers, and
hand them out in pairs to execs who had to make quick trips -
it was cheaper to eat the cost of the unused whole or half
tickets than to buy them only when they were needed.
The airlines hated this. The 'you must have a government id
which matches the name on the ticket' rule put an end to
the fungibility of airline tickets, which boosted their bottom
It's got nothing to do with security.
2. The capability vs credential argument runs all through
security. For example: Signed ActiveX code is using the
credential model, while the Java sandbox uses the capability
Another: 'Trust us not to look at your email without a warrant' is the credential model. 'Encrypt your email so they cant look
at it' is the capability model.
Techies tend to prefer the capability model over the credential
model - it not only works, but can be seen to work, and does
not rely on trust. Institutions prefer that people use the credential model, since that allows them to change the rules at the drop of a hat.  You can imagine applying the two models to airline passengers,
both of which would act to reduce the frequency of security 1. Capability model: You don't need to have ID at all, you can
pay cash on the plane (as I used to do on People Express)
but you'll get searched up the wazoo, and everything down to
a too-sharp pencil confiscated.
2. Credential model: You can take your Glock on board,
provided it's loaded with frangible bullets. However you'll have to have biometricaly enabled ID from the NRA certifying
that you've taken the 'Guns on Planes' course, a signed
affadavit from a psychiatrist saying you're sane and not
overly excitable, and a note from Mom saying you can.
Both are better from a security point of view than having unidentified armed people on board.
Always remember: The *stated* reason an institution puts
a restrictive policy is put in place do not necessarily have anything to do with the *actual* reason the institution
wants to put it in place.

As I said in an earlier post, there is usually a gulf - a huge one, between
what institutions say and what they do
Consider these actions of Lincoln in the light the above quotes:
Also, should those who debate the greatness of Lincoln
ignore the fact that he arrested and exiled a US Congressman
from Ohio - Clement Valladingham - who was also running for
governor of Ohio at the time, over anti-war remarks made
during a campaign speech?  Valladingham was arrested in his
bedroom in the middle of the night.
Should one also overlook Lincoln's destruction of the rule
of law in "loyal" Maryland? When Maryland voiced its support
for the CSA and appeared itself ready to secede, Lincoln
arrested 31 Maryland legislators, the mayor of Baltimore
(the nation's 3rd largest city at the time), and a US
Congressman from Maryland, as well as numerous editors and
Not only did Lincoln imprison two US Congressmen, he also
wrote out an arrest warrant for the Chief Justice of the US
Supreme Court, Roger Taney, after Taney wrote the opinion in
Ex Parte Merryman (1861) rebuking Lincoln's illegitimate
suspension of habeas corpus (see Charles Adams, p
46-53). John Marshall, whose opinion in Marbury v. Madison
(1803) famously declared that "It is emphatically the
province and duty of the judicial department to say what the
law is," also wrote the opinion in Ex Parte Bollman and
Swartwout (1807) declaring that suspension of habeas corpus
was a power vested only in the Congress. Lincoln simply
ignored the law. Additionally, US Army troops refused to
release Merryman into the custody of a federal marshal sent
by Taney pursuant to the court order that Merryman be freed.
Lincoln, then, imprisoned members of the federal legislative
branch, and also sought to imprison the chief member of the
federal judiciary. What happened to checks and balances?
Lincoln, with the backing of the army, simply exercised
whatever powers he desired. As noted Lincoln scholar Mark
Neely writes in The Last Best Hope of Earth, Lincoln
arrested the Marylanders "without much agonizing over their
constitutionality" (p 133).

How about suggestions to drop the whole idea?
(I'm sort of reminded of the classic Crumb cartoon: A bunch
of hippies sitting around a room, and one of them says
"I've got a great idea: Everyone stop playing head games with each other, starting now!")
This is a Really Bad Idea, for a number of reasons.
1. Any system of normalized 'voluntary' labeling has a habit of becoming effectively mandatory - see the content ratings on movies, and now video games and records. How'd you like to see the sorts of ratings you're proposing applied to books and magazines?
I don't want to see pissing matches over whether Alice
applied the right lables, in Bob's opinion.
2. Content drifts on this list, rapidly and frequently. 'Enemy at the door' started out with a truly stupid and dangerous idea for a face-recognition based booby trap, and finished as a  discussion of long-haul 802.11b networks. Asking every  person posting to spend time considering detailed and accurate labeling for every post they make is hopeless.
3. Irony, allegory, and insinuation are an integral part of activity on this type of mailing list, and by their nature, cannot be accurately captured by a rating system. Don't misapply a system created for more-or-less static standalone web pages to a freewheeling discussion list where each message cannot be properly understood except in light of a lot of context and history.
4. The things people complain about are usually much less
about topic, then they are complaints about other poster's positions on a given topic. We don't bitch too much about
postings concerning physics (which are pretty off-topic), but
we waste a lot of bits on bitching about Choate's version of
physics. This kind of thing is also not really captured by a
self-applied rating system.
I'm all in favor of informative Subject lines, but to systematize something just for the sake of systematizing it is pointless petty authoritarianism.

Sigh, the truth is out there; you just need to look it up.
Pu-239 (the major isotope of weapons grade plutonium) has a half life of
over 24,000 years, and is an alpha emitter. Alphas are very, very feeble, and won't get past the dead outer layer of your skin.
Pu-241 (a minor contaminant) is a bigger problem since it has a half life
of only 14.4. years, and decays to americium 241. Am-241 is a gamma
emitter, and a lot more difficult to shield.
Newly processed weapons grade PU in solid lumps is relatively harmless
stuff. I wouldn't want to hold it in my bare hand, but it's a pretty low
operation. Any serious mechanical processing will make dust, which is an entirely different scale of risk.
I have a vague memory of seeing a photo of a ?3 inch? ball of Pu (isotopic
composition unknown) in one of those old Time-Life books. The ball glowed
a dull red with it's own internal heat.

Curious. 4-5 years ago Denning and another associate (I forget who, it's in the archives :-) tried to market an authentication
scheme which purported to authenticate the location of a remote
user using GPS. The idea was that the user's machine would pick up the aggregate analog GPS signal available at it's location (either the regular, non-classified version or the high-precision classified signals), and transmit it to the server, which would use it to work out the location of the user - a user who was located at 'Pentagon, third ring, fourth floor, Army segment' would be accorded different privilieges than one whose location decoded as 'Presidential Palace, Baghdad'.
I and several other list subscribers pointed out numerous
issues. Among them were:
1. GPS signals don't work well in buildings of substantial
construction, and the chance of them working at all in a TEMPEST shielded building are about zip.
2. There are numerous DOS attacks available - the GPS
signals are easily jammed. One amusing approach would
be to use GPS test equipment to generate signals appropriate for a different location (eg, Pyongyang) and
beam them at the site to be DOS'd. 4. Conversely, an  attacker could use the same test equipment
to make it look like he's in the Pentagon, when he's actually
in Kandahar.
5. GPS is based on the relative time delays of signals from different satellites. Since network lag of hundreds of milliseconds must be accepted, anyone who can see the same set of satellites as the location to be spoofed can separate the signals from the different satellites, modify the lags appropriately, and remix to generate a
spoofed analog signal.
I sent these concerns to Denning, who replied that she
would address them only under NDA, which I declined to

@_subject: fuel injected firearm 
While I'm not a shootingpunk, here a couple points.
1. The space behind the slug of a man-usable firearm isn't that
big. To get a decent velocity you have to pack it with a propellant
with a high energy content. Gas or vapor phase systems are generally too low in energy/volume  (consider: you can run a
car on cylinders with <100cc of space above the cylinder at
max compression. If you filled the same space with cordite
you'd blow the engine apart instantly).
Using a larger combustion chamber feeding into the space
behind the slug might work (search on gas guns). The whole thing gets complex and heavy, since you have to mix the fuel and oxidizer, and feed in the slug.
2. Liquid propellant guns (search on that term) are well
developed for artillary, but I don't know of any light weapons which use this. LPGs are kind of neat in howitzer type applications because (1) A tank of
propellant & a rack of projectiles takes less space
than cased solid propellant shells, so you can carry
more ammo, and (2) you can vary the propellant
from shot to shot based on emergent conditions. One
neat hack is 'time on target' in which a series of rounds
are fired in quick succession, at different elevations and
propellant load so they all arrive at the target simultaneously.
(the LPG liquid propellant does not need an added oxidizer).

Tuesday October 2 3:33 AM ET Customs Wants Lists of Passengers
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Airlines should be required to turn over their
advance lists of passengers to screen for possible terrorists, the new
Customs Service commissioner says. Robert Bonner, in an interview with The Associated Press, said
Monday he first wants the passenger information for all international
flights headed for the United States. Then, he said, Congress should
consider requiring that such information be turned over for domestic
flights as well. The Customs Service has access to about 85 percent of international
flight passenger information under a voluntary program with the airlines.
It has no information on domestic flights. ``I believe that it would be extremely valuable if there is a requirement
that the airlines provide that information to Customs, to feed it into our
data base and thereby identify potential terrorists or other suspects who
make an attempt to enter the U.S.,'' Bonner said. On air travel, the agency has received information voluntarily from
airlines since 1988 on international air passengers, including names, birth
dates, nationality and travel document numbers. The information is
collected at the time of departure and transmitted to Customs while
flights are en route to the United States. Ninety-five air carriers and two governments - Australia's and New
Zealand's - transmit data on international soon-to-arrive air passengers
to a Customs facility in Virginia. Air carriers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Pakistan and Egypt are among those that don't participate, Customs
spokesman Dennis Murphy said. To force airlines to give international passenger information to Customs
may require congressional action. ``For a foreign airline that would be unwilling to provide the information,
we should simply deny the right to land in the United States,'' Bonner
suggested. Obtaining information on passengers traveling within the United States
also could be helpful to law enforcement, he said.

This type of thing is old - The Knights Templar set up a system by which a pilgrim could deposit money in his home country, and get a letter of
which would enable him or her to draw on that at Templar preceptories across Europe and into the Holy Land (12th century). I wouldnt be
suprised if there were Roman or earlier versions as well.
The split-bill technique has old roots.
"By the thirteenth century in England, private dealers,
accountants and businessmen were using a royal financial
system of the twelfth century to commit their business
transactions to a physical medium.  Their motivation was
only to monitor and keep track of the multitude of
transactions with clients in order to protect their
self-interest.  Thirteenth-century English businessmen used
tally sticks to record a proof of payment for goods
purchased or to show the liability of one party to make
payments to another.  Tally sticks were made of hazel wood
and the transactions taking place would be recorded and
reflected by notches carved into the tally with a knife.
The names of the parties involved in the transaction were
recorded with ink beside the notches, usually in Hebrew,
Latin or French. Tallies have also been found to have seals
attached to them, which were most likely used to
authenticate the record.  The size and shape of the notches,
and therefore the terms of the transaction, would be
mutually agreed upon by both parties, at which time the
tally would be split down the middle.  The two halves could
then be brought together, like two pieces of a puzzle, to
attest to the actual occurrence of the transaction and to
protect against forgery (10).  The tally stick is a
bipartite record whereby both parties have a portion of the
record to keep for their own interest and for evidence
should they need to prove an obligation or right.
Medieval chirographs are also characterized by their
bipartite nature.  Chirographs recorded agreements and
transactions of many things including the exchanges of goods
and services for financial consideration.  The terms of the
contract are written out twice (once on either side of the
parchment) and one large title is then written across the
top of the parchment spanning both instances of the
contract.  The parchment was then split down the middle, so
each party could retain a record of the contract.  Like the
tally stick, the two pieces of parchment could be brought
together and if the title at the top of the parchment lined
up correctly, the contract was deemed authentic."
[These tallysticks piled up in government archives, and
were kept long after no one could read them (the dead media
problem isn't new, either). In 1834 it was decided to dispose
of them by burning, but the fire got out of control and burned
down the Palace of Westminster]
More recently, in (I think) Philadelphia, people were able to
claim rewards for anonymous tips by sending in a torn sheet
of paper along with the tip. They could later pick up the cash from a designated bank by producing the other half, and showing
that the two matched. No ids where required.

I noticed one data point which suggests that the terrorists on Flight 11
from Boston did not have the flying skills of a commercial pilot.
CNN at one point showed the ground track of the flight (it was available
on some website). The flight kept it's normal track (slightly north of
west from Boston) until it crossed over the NY state border. Soon after
that, it took a sharp left turn and headed south for NYC. But not a straight
line - it was clear that they were following the Hudson River.
So, they were using visual navigation. An experienced, instrument rated
pilot could have flown a direct route to NYC, somewhat shortening the time his colleagues would have had to keep the passengers subdued. Further on the skills thing - at one time I toyed with the idea of getting
a private pilots license, and even took a couple lessons. I found that the
experience I had gained using a Flight Simulator program on a PC was
invaluable, particularly for getting the hang straight-and-level flight,
coordinated turns, changing altitudes, etc, which are all the skills that the terrorist would have needed.
This morning the local media here in Massachusetts were reporting that
a bag for the flight which fortuitously failed to get on the plane was found to contain a Koran, "Islamic materials", and a videotape on flying commercial jets. Clearly, someone who was already a commercial pilot would not have needed the latter item.
I sincerely hope that the remaining perpetrators of this atrocity are found and punished, but entertain no illusions that doing so will prevent future attacks. That can only come from a shift of US government attitude from "I've got the biggest stick", to one of non-interference. Sweden and Switzerland come to mind as prosperous, modern, western nations which don't have problems with terrorism. Our country should look to such successful terrorism prevention policies as examples.

secret police (he was killed a week after speaking at an anti-apartheid

What would actually happen is that there would not be an attempt

on the first three was that the usual protocol for hijacks involves
landing, and letting most/all of the passengers off unharmed.
For disarmed passengers, the best option for survival was to anticipate this protocol, and sit tight.
As soon as some of the passengers on plane 4 learned what
a different protocol was in effect, the terrorists were doomed. If a hijack was attempted today, even against disarmed passengers
by terrorists with guns there would be, in the words of one recent post 'entrails on the windows, even if the passengers were Quaker

A TV Plea for Patriot Hackers             By Brian McWilliams 2:00 a.m. Sep. 26, 2001 PDT A new TV public service announcement targets U.S. computer hacktivists with
a blunt
message: Uncle Sam wants you to help fight the war on terrorism. But the spot, which organizers hope to begin airing nationwide next week on
major networks,
will warn that misguided patriotic efforts from software experts can hurt
the cause. The first of its kind to address the issue of hacking, the "Hackers Against
spot will attempt to channel U.S. computer security gurus into productive

destructive action, said Parry Aftab, executive director of Cyberangels, an
Internet safety and help organization that is sponsoring the ads. "The hacker community is very important in the fight against terrorism. But
we want to get the
message out that if they want to get busy doing good stuff, they should come
to us and not
try to take action on their own," said Aftab. A couple points:
1. Is this really the first anti-hacking PSA? I don't think so - I

I'm going to respond to AARGH!, our new Sternlight, by asking two questions.
1. Why can't I control what signing keys the Fritz chip trusts? If the point of TCPA is make it so *I* can trust that *my* computer to run the software *I* have approved, and refuse to run something which a virus or Trojan has modifed (and this, btw, is the stated intention of TCPA), then why the hell don't I have full control over the keys? If I did, the thing might actually work to my benefit.
The beneficiary of TCPA when I don't have ultimate root control is
not I. It is someone else. That is not an acceptable situation.
2. It's really curious that Mr. AARGH! has shown up simultaneously
on the lists and on sci.crypt, with the single brief of supporting TCPA.
While I totally support his or her right to post anonymously, I can only
speculate that anonymity is being used to disguise some vested interest in supporting TCPA. In other words, I infer that Mr. AARGH!

Not really. However, in todays actual environment, this is frequently true that those with something to hide use anonymity. While some people have maintained nyms for many years (I can't
think of anyone maintaining explicit stong anonymity right now,
actually - remember Sue D. Nym? ),  and used them to talk about a variety of issues, it's pretty rare.
It's rare enough that when a new anononym appears, we know
that the poster made a considered decision to be anonymous.
The current poster seems to have parachuted in from nowhere, to argue a specific position on a single topic. It's therefore reasonable  to infer that the nature of that position and topic has some bearing on the decision to be anonymous.
Since the position argued involves nothing which would invoke the
malign interest of government powers or corporate legal departments, it's not that. I can only think of two reasons why our corrospondent
may have decided to go undercover... 1. If we know who he/she/them were, it would weaken the argument
(for example, by making it clear that the poster has a vested interest
in the position maintained, or that 'AARGH! is the group effort of an
astroturf campaign).
2. If the true identity of the poster became known, he/she/them
fears some kind of retribution:
* The ostracism and detestation of his peers.
* The boycotting of his employer. * His employer objecting to his wasting company time on   Internet mailing lists.
Our corrospondent has not given us any reason not to infer the worst motives. This is, after all, a discipline where
paranoia and suspicion are job requirements.

Regardless of what Sharon may or may not believe, I

The cypherpunks mailing list is not an organization. There is no
membership list, there are no officers. There are no dues, no
organizational hierarchy. There is no agreed set of aims, purposes,

It's SOP to take fingerprints of anyone who frequented the
crime scene, even if there is no doubt of their innocence. This
enables the majority of fingerprints collected to be eliminated
from consideration.
I remember reading of one of the very earliest fingerprint cases, somewhere in Europe (Austria?)in the late 1800s.  A murder had taken place in a boarding house, and the crime scene was seriously
disturbed by reporters, on-lookers, souvenier hunters, etc. However,
a bottle with a clear handprint was found under the bed.
There were no fingerprint registries at that time. The detective
had to get fingerprint cards for everyone who was near the site,
and found the murderer. The book included a photo of the bonfire
they made of the fingerprint cards afterwards.
Since then, of course, the level of ethics of the LEAs has deteriorated markedly - if they get a set of prints for whatever reason, it is never destroyed.
One civic volunteer program I work with is CHIP, a free local child identification program ( It provides parents with data to help in identifying their children if they go missing. This includes a fingerprint card taken by a policeman. All the data collected is retained by the parents - nothing by the police, and CHIP retains only a permission slip. I've been very heartened by the fact that now the majority of parents who are signing up their children actually raise the privacy issue - they want to make sure that neither we nor the police keep copies of the data.

@_subject: Closed source more secure than open source 
One factor which has been ignored so far is reputation effect the two regimes have on the programmer, and
the implications of that on how he writes.
In virtually every Open Source project I've seen, the code is signed. Not cryptographically -  the identity of the creator is known to anyone who chooses to look at the code.
If they know that there is a distinct possibility that a large number
of critical, intelligent, strangers are going to be looking over their
code, most programmers will make an extra effort to write well,
by the metrics their peers value. Thus, not only will the code work,
but it will be better commented, cleaner, and clearer. This leads
to fewer weak spots. You can't sweep dirt under the rug if there is no rug.
In an ideal world, of course, closed source programmers would
do the same, but human nature being what it is, they often don't.
With signed Open Source, every line of code becomes part of
an engineers reputation, part of the way they are judged by peers and potential employers. Peter Trei

@_subject: Tax consequences of becoming a US citizen. 
[I'm a US citizen who lived for many years abroad, so I have some awareness
of the issue].
Greg's pretty well got it spot on, but I'd like to refine things a bit. If a
citizen lives abroad, the USG will try to extract taxes from both his US
*and* foreign income, beyond certain minimums (the only other countries
which do this are the Phillipines and Egypt, both of which have large
numbers of citizens working in other countries (so they have an excuse, the US doesn't)). If you emigrate and give up your US citizenship, any assets you take
with you above a certain limit (?? $400k ??) are subject to a sort of 'exit tax'. This is an idea the US adopted from the Soviet Union,
where it was used to harrass Jewish emigrants. What is more, the IRS will still claim to be able to tax your non-US income for 10 years after you give up your citizenship (with caps, I think the same as an expat).
This law was put in place not too long ago, after there was a brief
storm in a teacup over certain multimillionaires giving up their
citizenships for tax purposes. In a populist stunt, the USG put in place
laws to punish these emigrants. In doing so they set the asset cap
so low that many people leaving for perfectly legitimate reasons were caught up in it. The political rhetoric around the issue was very nasty - it was clear that the congresscritters could not conceive that any person could have a legitimate, above-board reason to want to give up US citizenship.
Of course, at the moment the USG only occasionally chooses to flout
the sovereignty of foreign nations on issues of non-US citizens, and
it is still pretty rare for the USG to kidnap people abroad. Therefore, if you've given up your US citizenship, and are abroad, you have the
option of telling the IRS to pound sand before the 10 year limit is up.
If you do this, they will try to seize any US assets you may have,
and will arrest you for tax evasion if you ever set foot on US soil.
As Tim would say, check the archives. About 3 years ago, one or
two list members said they were giving up their US citizenship, and taking up Mozambiquian (sp?) citizenship, to enable them to
write and export cryptographic software without being subject to
US control. There was an extensive discussion of the topic at that
So, to the subject of the original question: I don't think taking up
US citizenship, then retiring abroad, makes a hell of a lot of
sense from a tax point of view, unless the Social Security payments
are important, the total assets taken out are low, and the expected
non-US income falls below the minimum the US allows expats tax-free. There are a lot of other effects of US citzenship vs US citizenship, but those are my non-lawyer speculations on the
tax implications.

It's been some time since I've worked on proxies, but
AFAIK, SSL connections tunnel through proxies already,
and the proxy cannot examine the content of the SSL

connection is headed).
It's easy to check - go to an SSL protected website,
and while viewing the page examine the certificate the site presented you with (click on 'security' in the toolbar in Netscape, or on IE, click Files->Properties->Certificates). If the certificate belongs to the site you're accessing, you're secure
from observation by the proxy. (the proxy can't
act as a MITM if the cert is from the far end).
If you wish to access a website which is not SSL
protected, try  which will encrypt browsing data between itself and your
browser, even for non-SSL sites. All your local
proxy can tell is that you are doing something
at megaproxy (and megaproxy knows everything).

Bush security plan calls for background checks
By DAN VERTON JULY 22, 2002
WASHINGTON -- Once a cabinet-level
Department of Homeland Security is established,
the Bush administration plans to convene a panel
of government and private-sector experts to
determine the legal guidelines for subjecting tens
of thousands of private-sector employees to
background investigations. That means tens of thousands of private-sector
employees working in industries such as
banking, chemicals, energy, transportation, telecommunications, shipping and public health would be subject to background checks as a condition of employment. Tom Ridge, the current director of the Office of Homeland Security and the leading contender
to become Bush's nominee for the cabinet post, said on July 21 that the nation remains at risk from an unknown number of terrorist cells operating within the U.S. And according to the national strategy, that situation could be further complicated by malicious insiders with authorized access to critical facilities. "Personnel with privileged access to critical infrastructure, particularly [IT-based] control systems, may serve as terrorist surrogates by providing information on vulnerabilities, operating characteristics and protective
measures," the Bush strategy states. Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets

Actually, this clicks neatly onto cp debates over open vs closed
systems, TCPA, DRM, and 'freedom to hack'.
Most modern cars are substantially computerized. Diagnosing a
problem usually involves hooking up a PC to a port on the car's
engine management system, and studying the readouts.
The 'problem' that the congresscritters are trying to 'solve' is
that some car manufacturers are now closing this interface -
they are refusing to document the protocols, and/or encrypting
the data.
As a result, the manufacturers are able to restrict who has
access to this diagnostic data, and are using this power to
shut out independent repair shops and other competition to
their own dealerships. The meeting is going to discuss whether 'something should be done'. I have no idea what will
happen, if anything.
So, let's see:
* The manufacturers are using DRM technology, including crypto,
to restrict access to the data.
* If you reverse-engineered the system, the DMCA could get
involved (not sure on this one).
* The manufacturers are closing the system to outside inspection,
and actively working to make it impossible for owners to tinker with or modify their own cars. * There is absolutely no benefit to the car's owner - this is simply
large corporationsfiguring out another way to get more revenue.
This is essentially 'Palladium for cars'.

AARG!, our anonymous Pangloss, is strictly correct - Wagner should have
said "could" rather than "would".
However, TCPA and Palladium fall into a class of technologies with a
tremendous potential for abuse. Since the trust model is directed against
the computer's owner (he can't sign code as trusted, or reliably control which signing keys are trusted), he has ceded ultimate control of what he can and can't do with his computer to another. Sure, TCPA can be switched off - until that switch is disabled. It could potentially be permenantly disabled by a BIOS update, a security patch, a commercial program which carries signed disabling code as a Trojan, or over the net through a backdoor or vulnerability in any networked software. Or by Congress which could make running a TCPA capable machine with TCPA turned off illegal.
With TCPA, I now have to trust that a powerful third party, over
which I have no control, and which does not necessarily have
my interests are heart, will not abuse it's power. I don't
want to have to do that.

The MPAA does not have to 'will them out of existance', or even make

At least, this is my interpretation:
The FCC has mandated a change to all-digital formats over the
next 5 years or so. After that, analog (NTSC) transmission will
be phased out. There is currently a lot of work being done within
the BPDG (Broadcast Protection Discussion Group) to provide
watermark checking, cryptographic and physical protection of digital video and audio data all the way to the display device, and forbid 'complying devices' from having accessible unencrypted outputs or busses. There are even proposals that if a 'complying device' is found to be hackable, that there should be a backdoor to
enable the manufacturer to modify or disable it remotely.
Until these standards are settled one way or the other, anyone
buying digital video equipment (HDTV or otherwise) runs a very substantial risk of finding themselves with a set of expensive
and otherwise useless doorstops.
Progress and innovation in electronics will occur only
at the whim (and in the interest) of the entertainment industry.

Tim: I'm working on more then 'hunches'. Consider:
- start quote -
The FCC reaffirmed its service rules for the conversion by all U.S.
broadcasters to digital broadcasting services (DTV), including build-out construction
schedules, NTSC and DTV channel simulcasting, and the return of analog channels to the government by 2006.
- end quote -
That's the official USG position 5 years ago. Note the last clause
in particular. Your NTSC set will be a paperweight, at least as far as over-the-air reception is concerned, by 2006.
Now, in reality, the trashing of your old TV may be delayed...
(I'm quoting from  here):
- start quote -
Ending the Transition  By Congressional mandate, the transition period ends on
 December 31, 2006. On that date, NTSC broadcasting should
 terminate and stations should operate in a DTV mode alone,
 unless the FCC has granted a waiver. Any extensions beyond
 the final date will be considered on a market-by-market basis.  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Commission is
 required to grant a station's request for an extension if:  One or more stations affiliated with one of the Top-4 networks is
 not operating digitally, because the Commission has granted
 the station(s) an extension of time to complete construction;  Digital-to-analog converters are not generally available on the
 market; or  Fifteen percent or more of the homes in the market cannot
 receive a DTV signal either off the air or via cable or do not have
 either a digital TV set or analog-to-digital converter attached to
 one NTSC TV set capable of receive DTV signals in their local
 market. - end quote -
...but it will happen eventually. After the stations are
broadcasting digitally, the analog stations are unneeded,
and regardless of whether the FCC or the station has the
auction rights, they'll want to sell off the old spectrum.
Neither the FCC nor the broadcasters will want to forego
the money.

they don't have to. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you've rebought some of
your VCR tapes as DVDs. Whey wouldn't the MPAA think they can
make you do it over?
The BCPG etal are moaning about the 'analog hole' because that's the
one they can't easily fix. They've already agreed not to license the marketing of devices with unprotected digital-out (the deCSS case
was about this, remember?) So the 'digital hole' is already plugged -
as more and more devices recognize and respond to the watermarks,
the usability of a ripped digital-to-digital file decreases. Well, Napster just went Chapter 11. Any future system which requires
either vintage or illegally hacked HW will have very limited usage.
I've seen them too - very, very nice!
Not everyone is single and living alone.

and my wife joined us for Malcom in the Middle (very funny, but about a lifestyle alien to you). Saturday night we had 5 people sit through Harry Potter, as did about 8 of the neighbourhood kids on Sunday afternoon.
There are a very large number of families-with-kids out there, and family
viewing is common.
On a side note - the HP movie (which I'm not that fond of) is in
itself an example of the publishers being willing to piss people off.
The deleted scenes (one of the better things you get on DVDs)
where hidden behind a long and very inobvious set of operations
in the 'special features' section, essentially as an Easter Egg.
Not only that, but the operations neccesary to reach them reliably crashed my DVD player, which less then a year old,

There are doubtless etymologists who could answer this definitively. I don't have aceess to the OED online, which could at least give us

The question on hand is the origin of boot (British) vs trunk (American)
for the storage at the rear of a sedan car.
I really, really don't think either Tim or Mike are on the right track.
American pimp slang is very unlikely to have affected British motoring jargon. Instead, I suggest the both 'boot' and 'booty'
may come from a much older English usage of 'butt' to refer the
the rear end of something - whether a person (buttocks), or the
end of a spear or a cigarette (butt).
Many horse-drawn coaches (and some early automobiles) had
a luggage style trunk strapped on the back for storage. Thiis seems a source for the American 'trunk', and also give an alternative route to 'boot'. Many early automobile terms are from the French (chauffeur, carburetor ), and the French
term for 'box' is 'boite', which could easily migrate in British
English to 'boot'.

In such devices (e.g., PC video capture cards), the role of the watermark detector would be to detect the watermark and ensure that the device responds appropriately.

Note that is refers to "all devices that perform analog to digital

in mind (their example is a video capture card, a much more complex beast),
but overbroad language has gotten into too many laws for me to have any

plans to remove the restrictions from a compromised vidcap card, and
how to mail order standard DACs? Will trafficing in DAC chips become a DMCA

It's a pipe. The whole plaintext IP packet, from start to finish, including headers and checksum, gets treated as data, and encrypted.
The encrypted packet is the data for a new packet, which goes from one
firewall to another (and has only the firewall IP addresses exposed). The
packets visible on the outside only tell Eve that firewall A sent firewall
B an IPSEC packet of a certain size, with a particular Security Association.
(ie, the protocol field says 'this is an IPSEC packet').
A single SA can be used for many, many, internal connections.

Software leaves encryption keys, passwords lying around in memory

       From: pgut001 at cs.auckland.ac.nz (Peter Gutmann)
       Subject: Software leaves encryption keys, passwords lying around in
       The following problem was first pointed out (in private mail) by
       Howard from Microsoft.  His writeup is now available at
       From a representative check of a few widely-used open source crypto
       programs, this affects quite a bit of software.
       The problem he points out is that clearing sensitive information such
       encryption keys from memory may not work as expected because an
       compiler removes the memset() if it decides it's redundant.  Consider
       example the following:
       int encrypt( const void *key )
         {
         puts( key );     /* Normally we'd encrypt here */
         }
       void main( void )  /* Because we can */
         {
         char key[ 16 ];
         strcpy( key, "secretkey" );
         encrypt( key );
         memset( key, 0, 16 );
         }
       When compiled with any level of optimisation using gcc, the key
       call goes away because of dead code elimination (see the MSDN article
       more details on this, which uses VC++ to get the same effect).  While
       can kludge enough stuff around a custom memory-clear call to fool the
       optimiser (hacks with 'volatile', touching the memory after it's
cleared and
       hoping the optimiser is fooled, etc etc) there's no guarantee that
       work for anything but the compiler(s) you happen to test it with -
       future enhancement to the optimiser may turn it back into a nop.
What it
       really needs is the addition of a        in the compiler.  Until then, a lot of security code will be affected
       this problem.
         [In RISKS, I tend never to alter British spellings.  However,
         in American English, an "optimiser" must be the ultimate miser.]

The  fixes are good, but non-portable.
None of the portable fixes can be trusted against an arbitrarily smart
optimizer. and they have space and performance hits.
The 'volatile' keyword seems to have poorly defined behaviour.
Perhaps the next 'C' standard needs a new keyword, 'always'
which tells the compiler that this line *must* be included:
always memset(arr,0,sizeof(arr));
...but this seems to break the rules, in that it's really a standard-defined  in disguise.

It does look kind of like a "dumbed down SecurID" - but what it looks like even more is an ActivCard keychain token repackaged into a bigger form factor. The code generation scheme
appears similar as well. The Company Info page reveals that ActivCard actually manufactures the device. I'd be nervous about a availability with centralized servers,  even if they are "triple redundant with two sites". DDOS attacks, infrastructure (backhoe) attacks, etc, could all wreck havoc.
I also wonder about scalability with centralized servers. A BBC article
claims 600 authentications/second, in a system which cost UKP 1M
in hardware alone. This is not really good enough if you're trying to
cover the world (or even just Britain) from one site. AOL gets about *50,000* login attempts per second at peak times, to give one admittedly extreme example.

I'm really happy with this - I wrote to Jim Bidzos proposing

So I was in at the start of the contests, and at the end of
this one (I was one of the two people at RSA who independently confirmed the decryption).

I spoke to David McNett (nugget at distributed.net) yesterday. He told me that
they intend to fire up a the RC5-72 challenge, hoping to get lucky and find
the key near the beginning.
I think they're open to other suggestions, however. Factoring may or may not
be reasonable. While RC5, DES, etc require minimal memory and storage,
and can so run unobtrusively in the spare cycles of almost any machine,
- even the seiving step - has large memory and storage requirements. The
matrix reduction step at the end does not have any efficient distributed

I think the lower RSA factoring challenges *may* be possible - RSA-576 is
standing, with a $10k prize. Other factoring challenges have up to $200k
Challenges need to be carefully set up. It must be legal - hacking a
system in the face of the objections of the owner won't fly. It must be
in that there must be no reason to suspect collaboration between the challenger and the attacker. It must be realistic - it should model a
use closely enough to show that changes need to be made (the RSA secret
key challenges where designed with IPSEC headers in mind - the single DES
option was deprecated as soon as we showed that to be weak).
This is an exciting time. With RC5-64 fallen, there are a lot of options for
to do next. The most interesting thing may not involve cryptanalysis.

FBI Issues Alert Against Almanac Carriers
December 29, 2003
  By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Filed at 7:43 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is warning police nationwide to
be alert for people carrying almanacs, cautioning that the
popular reference books covering everything from
abbreviations to weather trends could be used for terrorist
In a bulletin sent Christmas Eve to about 18,000 police
organizations, the FBI said terrorists may use almanacs
``to assist with target selection and pre-operational
It urged officers to watch during searches, traffic stops
and other investigations for anyone carrying almanacs,
especially if the books are annotated in suspicious ways.
``The practice of researching potential targets is
consistent with known methods of al-Qaida and other
terrorist organizations that seek to maximize the
likelihood of operational success through careful
planning,'' the FBI wrote.
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the bulletin this
week and verified its authenticity.
``For local law enforcement, it's just to help give them
one more piece of information to raise their suspicions,''
said David Heyman, a terrorism expert for the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies. ``It helps make sure one more bad guy doesn't get
away from a traffic stop, maybe gives police a little bit
more reason to follow up on this.''
The FBI noted that use of almanacs or maps may be innocent,
``the product of legitimate recreational or commercial
activities.'' But it warned that when combined with
suspicious behavior -- such as apparent surveillance -- a
person with an almanac ``may point to possible terrorist
``I don't think anyone would consider us a harmful
entity,'' said Kevin Seabrooke, senior editor of The World
Almanac. He said the reference book includes about a dozen
pages out of its 1,000 pages total listing the world's
tallest buildings and bridges but includes no diagrams or
architectural schematics. ``It's stuff that's widely
available on the Internet,'' he said.
The publisher for The Old Farmers Almanac said Monday
terrorists would probably find statistical reference books
more useful than the collections of Americana in his famous
publication of weather predictions and witticisms.
``While we doubt that our editorial content would be of
particular interest to people who would wish to do us harm,
we will certainly cooperate to the fullest with national
authorities at any level they deem appropriate,'' publisher
John Pierce said.
The FBI said information typically found in almanacs that
could be useful for terrorists includes profiles of cities
and states and information about waterways, bridges, dams,
reservoirs, tunnels, buildings and landmarks. It said this
information is often accompanied by photographs and maps.
The FBI urged police to report such discoveries to the
local U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

control from nature, and is now faced with choices which
just didn't exist in the past. How individuals and societies
should make these decisions is pretty much uncharted
For any proposed change, some people will think it's a bad
idea, some people will think its great, and some people won't have an opinion. The proportions (and the reasons)
will vary from decision to descision.
There are some things where nearly everyone will agree
a genetic fix is desirable - for example, suceptibility to
heart disease, cancer, dental caries, and myopia. Other 'vanity' fixes seem pretty harmless - being tall, busty,
or having a well-stuffed package. Its when we get to 'fixes' to behaviour and personality
that things start to get very hairy. I fear that those in
power will use genetic engineering as they have used
every other tool at their disposal - weapons, states,
laws, and governments - to maintain their position at
the expense of the overall welfare of the species, by
allowing improvements only to their own descendents,
while requiring changes to those out of power which
make it harder for them to change their status.
One scenario:
"Mr & Mrs Smith: The No Child Should Fear Act of
2015 requires that your proposed son have the
'bullying' gene deleted if he is to attend publicly
funded schools. This is similar to the old requirements
for vaccination - we don't want your son to endanger
other children, do we? Of course, this also weakens any leadership
ability he might have been able to exercise later in
life, as well as his tendency to question authority, but
if it saves one child from humiliation at the hands of a
bully, its worth it.
If you don't want to accept this change, you are of
course free to send your child to private school, as
do most leaders. If you can afford it, that is...."
So, who gets to decide what changes are good, and
for whom? I know what I want the answer to be, but
I'm not certain that is the one that will come to pass.

I'll ditto that - my brother is an extremist audiophile - he writes
reviews for the high-end stuff (google "Mike Trei"). Many (by
no means all) top end audophiles prefer all-analog equipment,
and direct-cut vinyl records (ie, the master disk was cut directly
at the performance, without a magtape master). I've listened to
some of this stuff, and it just blows digital away.
The general attitude is that while low-end digital beats low-end
analog, high-end analog beats high-end digital. Digital places
a distinct floor on how bad the quality can be, but it also puts
a ceiling on it. The data capacity of a vinyl groove is a lot higher
than a CD pit-track, but you need very good equipment to use it.
While the ear can't hear above 22KHz, signal above that *can*
effect the perceived sound, by heterodyne effects. For example,
if you play a single tone of 28KHz, or a single tone of 30 KHz,
you can't hear them. Play them together, however, and you
*can* hear a beat frequency of 2KHz.

Making a 9-digit number up at random is a bad idea, as it may coincide with someone's real number and cause them some amount of grief. It's better to use a number like 078-05-1120, which was printed on "sample" cards inserted in thousands of new wallets sold in the 40's and 50's. It's been used so widely that both the IRS and SSA recognize it immediately as bogus, while most clerks haven't heard of it. There were at least 40 different people in the Selective Service database at one point who gave this number as their SSN. The Social Security Administration recommends that people showing Social Security cards in advertisements use numbers in the range 987-65-4320 through 987-65-4329.
There are several patterns that have never been assigned, and which therefore don't conflict with anyone's real number. They include numbers with any field all zeroes, and numbers with a first digit of 8 or 9.

The USB dongle apparently acts only as a key

is put on the device by the manufacturer !!!!
though they promise "Enova Technology does not maintain a database of X-Wall Secure Keys". On the good side, it seems
to encrypt the whole disk, including the

No info on chaining modes, if any, nor of

Color me dissapointed. It's a move in the right direction, but I wish they had followed through and
done the right things:
* [AES | 3DES]/CBC with a good distribution of IVs
* User-generated keys (before initial disk setup, of course).
* Shutdown on dongle removal.
* Some kind of PIN or password protection on the dongle.
eNova claims not to keep a database of keys (they don't
say that 'there is no database of keys', which is a little
different), and to get a key copied you have to send it to
them. They do seem to supply a spare.
Back a few years ago, I calculated that with the DES key
search software then available, a single 200MHz machine
could search 40 bits of keyspace over a long weekend. Today it would take a few hours.

Possibly - they're using an ASIC, so I'd have thought that speed would not
be the issue. I have not run the numbers.
I'm not really up on crypto file systems, but I beleive at least some
use the sector address as the IV. IVs don't need to be random,
secret, or unpredictable - they just need to be unrepeated. (I'm
assuming sector-at-a-time encryption).
Having the user generate the key and load it on the dongle means that he has good assurance that the manufacturer doesn't have the key. Any kind of backup will open a possible route of
attack. If the user can specify the raw key value (it's short - this
is symmetric crypto), they can choose their own backup - up to
and including writing it on paper and carefuly hiding it.
We're talking about two different products. The ABIT is a MB, presumably with it's own custom BIOS, so that's not an issue there. Peter (T)

Googling on ("event data recorders" automobiles) will give a lot

These devices are a byproduct of the introduction of
airbags - the airbag processor stores the data which led it to
deploy the bag.
This can include
delta v
vehicle speed
engine speed
brake use
throttle position
driver seatbelt use
The cited report claims they only store the most recent 5 seconds
of data, snapshotted at 1 second intervals. It notes that the data can thus be confusing - for example, if a wheel leaves the ground
the speed reported can be way off, and if the driver pumps the
brakes, the 'brake use' data is ambiguous. It's not clear whether they
store data continuously, or just when the airbag deploys.
OTOH, I seem to remember reports of drivers of high-end cars (Audis?
BMWs?) getting their warranties invalidated because the main car
computer noted that they had exceeded certain speeds during the

The feeling I get is that Oregon combines the worst of California and

California has a highly intrusive, interventionist government, but this
is leavened by the liberalism of many of the positions it holds. Thus,
while California is really bad for some individual rights (such as the
RKBA), it's fairly libertine on others (such as lifestyles).
In the 'classic Western' states (I'm thinking of Wyoming, Montana,
Nevada, Idaho, etc, and I don't claim to be really well informed on this),
while the general population holds pretty rightwing views, this is
leavened by a strain of semi-libertarianism in the government, in the
'don't intevene' sense.
Oregon seems to combine the worst of both, along with none of the
good points - a highly intrusive California style government, with
very rightwing views.

Red Brigades PDA highlights encryption controversy By Philip Willan,
IDG News Service May 21, 2003 ROME - Italian police have seized at least two
Psion PLC PDAs (personal digital assistants) from members of
the Red Brigades terrorist organization but the major
investigative breakthrough they were hoping for as a result of
the information contained on the devices has failed to
materialize -- thwarted by encryption software used by the
left-wing revolutionaries.
Failure to crack the code, despite the reported assistance of
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) computer experts,
puts a spotlight on the controversy over the wide availability
of powerful encryption tools.
The Psion devices were seized on March 2 after a shootout on a
train travelling between Rome and Florence, Italian media and
sources close to the investigation said. The devices, believed
to number two or three, were seized from Nadia Desdemona Lioce
and her Red Brigades comrade Mario Galesi, who was killed in
the shootout. An Italian police officer was also killed. At
least one of the devices contains information protected by
encryption software and has been sent for analysis to the FBI
facility in Quantico, Va., news reports and sources said.
The FBI declined to comment on ongoing investigations, and
Italian authorities would not reveal details about the
information or equipment seized during the shootout.
The software separating the investigators from a potentially
invaluable mine of information about the shadowy terrorist
group, which destabilized Italy during the 1970s and 1980s and
revived its practice of political assassination four years ago
after a decade of quiescence, was PGP (Pretty Good Privacy),
the Rome daily La Repubblica reported. So far the system has
defied all efforts to penetrate it, the paper said.
Palm-top devices can only run PGP if they use the Palm OS or
Windows CE operating systems, said Phil Zimmermann, who
developed the encryption software in the early 1990s. Psion
PLC uses its own operating system known as Epoc, but it might
still be possible to use PGP as a third party add-on, a
spokesman for the British company said.
There is no way that the investigators will succeed in
breaking the code with the collaboration of the current
manufacturers of PGP, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based PGP,
Zimmermann said in a telephone interview.
"Does PGP have a back door? The answer is no, it does not," he
said. "If the device is running PGP it will not be possible to
break it with cryptanalysis alone."
Investigators would need to employ alternative techniques,
such as looking at the unused area of memory to see if it
contained remnants of plain text that existed before
encryption, Zimmermann said.
The investigators' failure to penetrate the PDA's encryption
provides a good example of what is at stake in the
privacy-versus-security debate, which has been given a whole
new dimension by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S.
Zimmermann remains convinced that the advantages of PGP, which
was originally developed as a human rights project to protect
individuals against oppressive governments, outweigh the
"I'm sorry that cryptology is such a problematic technology,
but there is nothing we can do that will give this technology
to everyone without also giving it to the criminals," he
said. "PGP is used by every human rights organization in the
world. It's something that's used for good. It saves lives."
Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union are examples of
governments that had killed far more people than all the
world's criminals and terrorists combined, Zimmermann said. It
was probably technically impossible, Zimmermann said, to
develop a system with a back door without running the risk
that the key could fall into the hands of a Saddam Hussein or
a Slobodan Milosevic, the former heads of Iraq and Yugoslavia,
"A lot of cryptographers wracked their brains in the 1990s
trying to devise strategies that would make everyone happy and
we just couldn't come up with a scheme for doing it," he said.
"I recognize we are having more problems with terrorists now
than we did a decade ago. Nonetheless the march of
surveillance technology is giving ever increasing power to
governments. We need to have some ability for people to try to
hide their private lives and get out of the way of the video
cameras," he said.
Even in the wake of Sept. 11, Zimmermann retains the view that
strong cryptography does more good for a democracy than
harm. His personal website,  contains
letters of appreciation from human rights organizations that
have been able to defy intrusion by oppressive governments in
Guatemala and Eastern Europe thanks to PGP. One letter
describes how the software helped to protect an Albanian
Muslim woman who faced an attack by Islamic extremists because
she had converted to Christianity.
Zimmermann said he had received a letter from a Kosovar man
living in Scandinavia describing how the software had helped
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in its struggle against the
Serbs. On one occasion, he said, PGP-encrypted communications
had helped to coordinate the evacuation of 8,000 civilians
trapped by the Serbs in a Kosovo valley. "That could have
turned into another mass grave," Zimmermann said.
Italian investigators have been particularly frustrated by
their failure to break into the captured Psions because so
little is known about the new generation of Red
Brigades. Their predecessors left a swathe of blood behind
them, assassinating politicians, businessmen and security
officials and terrorizing the population by "knee-capping," or
shooting in the legs, perceived opponents. Since re-emerging
from the shadows in 1999 they have shot dead two university
professors who advised the government on labor law reform.
Zimmermann is not optimistic about the investigators' chances
of success. "The very best encryption available today is out
of reach of the very best cryptanalytic methods that are known
in the academic world, and it's likely to continue that way,"
he said.
Sources close to the investigation have suggested that they
may even have to turn to talented hackers for help in breaking
into the seized devices. One of the magistrates coordinating
the inquiry laughed at mention of the idea. "I can't say
anything about that," he said.
The technical difficulty in breaking PGP was described by an
expert witness at a trial in the U.S. District Court in
Tacoma, Wash., in April 1999. Steven Russelle, a detective
with the Portland Police Bureau, was asked to explain what he
meant when he said it was not "computationally feasible" to
crack the code. "It means that in terms of today's technology
and the speed of today's computers, you can't put enough
computers together to crack a message of the kind that we've
discussed in any sort of reasonable length of time," he told
the court.
Russelle was asked whether he was talking about a couple of
years or longer. "We're talking about millions of years," he

see if it accurately records his choices, and then is required to
put it in a ballot box retained at the polling site.

No direct proof. This was at a restaurant called "The New Deal"
in SoHo, NYC, I think on Prince Street. Once a year they would
carry a game menu for a couple weeks, and I went there with a
bunch of friends. Among other things, we ordered rattlesnake, alligator, buffalo, venison, zebra, bear, and lion. I liked most of it - the alligator not so much, nor the zebra (partly because we got an unusual cut - the 'prarie oysters' :-).
Were they faking it?  The snake, buffalo, deer, and bear I had
had before, and they seemed the real McCoy. We tried to order
elephant, but they were out. If they were intent on fraud, would they have told us that?
Out of curiosity, I asked about sources, and it turns out that, except for the rattlesnake and bear it all came from game ranches, mostly down in Texas. I know they also ranch lion down there. I don't know where they got elephant, but
the source seemed more sporadic.
At the prices they were charging, I'm sure they had no need
to fake it.

This is kind of broken. Allowing the voter to get a receipt which
they take away with them for verification may allow the voter to verify
that their vote was recorded as cast, but also allows coercion and vote buying.
To their credit, the creators thought of this, and suggest a
partial procedural fix in the threat analysis document:
The first problem, or course, is that a person under threat of coercion will need to present the coercer with a receipt showing exactly the mix of votes the coercer required. This is leads to a combinatorial explosion of fake receipts that need to be available.
Having only one vote on each receipt might mitigate this, but it still
gets really messy.
Second, it's not clear how this protects against the coercer checking the
ballot online - will every fake also be recorded in the system, so
it passes the online check? Having both real and fake ballots in
the verification server makes me very nervous.
Its possible I've missed something - this is based on a quick glance
through the online documents, but I don't see any advantage this system has over the much more discussed one where the reciept is
printed in a human readable way, shown to the voter, but retained inside the machine as a backup for recounts.

The system described allows the user to take a reciept (which has
only numbers on it) and use a website to determine that the vote
was recorded correctly.
A decoy receipt would also have to pass this test.
Frankly, the whole online-verification step seems like an
unneccesary complication.
* Both real and decoy receipts would have to be in the database
for verification - which bothers me a lot.
* There seems to be no provision for recounts - what are they supposed to do - have everybody send in their receipts? How can you
tell the decoys from the real?

Yes, that seems to be the case. Note that in the current
(non computer) systems, we have no way to assure that our votes  actually contributed to the total, but the procedural stuff of having mutually hostile observers to the counting process makes deliberate discarding of one side's votes less likely. (Non-deliberate losses - such as the recent failure to record cards marked with the wrong kind of pen - can still happen).
VoteHere, while they seem to be well-meaning, have
not solved the problem. Mercuri & Rivest have described how to do it right; we just need someone

As Ian has noted, self-auditability and uncoercibility seem to be to be mutually exclusive requirements.
If you're going to assume that the whole system is untrustworthy,
you're still screwed despite the receipts - if the website says that yes, your vote counted in the final total, that still does not tell you that the right candidate was declared the winner. That would only happen if enough voters pooled their verifications to show that that
had to be the case (this is equivalent to a recount).
In a close-run two candidate race, if a number of voters equal to half the gap between the the candidate's totals failed to verify
and report that their vote was recorded correctly, the result
is still untrustworthy.
....and any system which relies on advanced mathematics
will be unintelligible and mistrusted by the average voter.

Our anonymous corrospondent has not addressed the issues I raised in my initial post on the 7th:
1. The use of receipts which a voter takes from the voting place to 'verify'
their vote was correctly included in the total opens the way for voter
2. The proposed fix - a blizzard of decoy receipts - makes recounts based
on the receipts impossible.
Asking the readers of this list to 'familiarize themselves with the
literature', is, in many cases,  a little like telling Tiger Woods that he needs to familiarize himself with the rules of golf. We know the 'advanced cryptographic techniques' you refer to. We also know what their limitations
- what they can and cannot do. This is not the appropriate forum to try to say
"trust me".
Answer this:
1. How does this system prevent voter coercion, while still allowing receipt
based recounts? Or do you have some mechanism by which I can
personally verify every vote which went into the total, to make sure they
are correct?
2. On what basis do you think the average voter should trust this system,
seeing as it's based on mechanisms he or she cant personally verify?
3. What chain of events do I have to beleive to trust that the code which
is running in the machine is actually and correctly derived from the source code I've audited? I refer you to Ken Thompsons classic paper "Reflections on trusting trust", as well as the recent Diebold debacle
with uncertified patches being loaded into the machine at the last moment.
This last is an important point - there is no way you can eliminate the
requirement of election officials to behave legitimately. Since that
requirement can't be done away with by technology, adding technology
only adds more places the system can be compromised.
Based on the tone of this letter, I'd hazard a guess that 'privacy' has a
vested interest in VoteHere. If this true, it's a little odd that they are
willing to expose their source code, but not their name. We don't
bite, unless the victim deserves it :-) Opening your source is an
admirable first step - why not step out of the shadows so we can
help you make your system better?
I fear a system which does not have a backup mechanism that the
average voter can understand. While it's true that non-electronic
systems are subject to compromise, so are electronic ones, regardless of their use of ZK proofs, or 'advanced cryptographic
I do think electronic voting machines are coming, and a good

Dean should come clean on privacy
January 26, 2004, 4:00 AM PT
By Declan McCullagh
After Howard Dean's unexpected defeat last week in Iowa, public attention has focused on his temper, his character, and that guttural Tyrannosaurus bellow of his not-quite-a-concession speech. But Dean's views on Americans' privacy rights may be a superior test of his fitness to be president.
Dean's current stand on privacy appears to leave little wiggle room: His campaign platform pledges unwavering support for "the constitutional principles of equality, liberty and privacy."
Fifteen months before Dean said he would seek the presidency, however, the former Vermont governor spoke at a conference in Pittsburgh co-sponsored by smart-card firm Wave Systems where he called for state drivers' licenses to be transformed into a kind of standardized national ID card for Americans. Embedding smart cards into uniform IDs was necessary to thwart "cyberterrorism" and identity theft, Dean claimed. "We must move to smarter license cards that carry secure digital information that can be universally read at vital checkpoints," Dean said in March 2002, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. "Issuing such a card would have little effect on the privacy of Americans."
Dean also suggested that computer makers such as Apple Computer, Dell, Gateway and Sony should be required to include an ID card reader in PCs--and Americans would have to insert their uniform IDs into the reader before they could log on. "One state's smart-card driver's license must be identifiable by another state's card reader," Dean said. "It must also be easily commercialized by the private sector and included in all PCs over time--making the Internet safer and more secure."
The presidential hopeful offered few details about his radical proposal. "On the Internet, this card will confirm all the information required to gain access to a state (government) network--while also barring anyone who isn't legal age from entering an adult chat room, making the Internet safer for our children, or prevent adults from entering a children's chat room and preying on our kids...Many new computer systems are being created with card reader technology. Older computers can add this feature for very little money," Dean said.
There's probably a good reason why Dean spoke so vaguely: It's unclear how such a system would work in practice. Must Internet cafes include uniform ID card readers on public computers? Would existing computers have to be retrofitted? Would tourists be prohibited from bringing laptops unless they sported uniform ID readers? What about Unix shell accounts? How did a politician who is said to be Internet-savvy concoct this scheme?

* Evaporating LPG (liquids do not 'sublimate') will burn at the   interface where the proper mixture is obtains - and the heat
  from that will speed the evaporization of the rest.
* LPGs (both butane and propane) are denser than air.
  Propane has about the same density as CO2.
  Butane is even denser. They will both travel downhill
  and pool in low spots. * LPGs can most definitely asphyxiate you.
"LPG can form a flammable mixture when mixed with air. The flammable range at ambient temperature and pressure extends between approximately 2 % of the vapour in air at its lower limit and approximately 10 % of the vapour in air at its upper limit. Within this range there is a risk of ignition. Outside this range any mixture is either too weak or too rich to propagate flame. However, over-rich mixtures can become hazardous when diluted with air and will also burn at the interface with air."
"LPG vapour is denser than air: butane is about twice as heavy as air and propane about one and a half times as heavy as air. Consequently, the vapour may flow along the ground and into drains, sinking to the lowest level of the surroundings and be ignited at a considerable distance from the source of leakage. In still air vapour will disperse "At very high concentrations in air, LPG vapour is anaesthetic and subsequently an asphyxiant by diluting or decreasing the available The 'rise to the sky and disperse' stuff you're talking about applies
to hydrogen, not LPG. A massive LPG spill will spread out over the surface of the ground and water, and when a source of ignition is found,
the whole mass will burn at the interface where it mixes with air.

OK, I agree I was a bit snarky. Mea culpas below.
Not only that, but it doesn't burn that fast:
"Natural gas is only combustible at a concentration of 5 to 15 percent when mixed with air. And, its flame speed is very slow. These facts may best be experienced by a simple demonstration often done at LNG fire schools. A large pit, i.e., 20' x 20', is filled with LNG, allowing the vapor cloud to drift with the wind. The cloud is ignited with a torch from a downwind side. Ignition typically occurs near the visible fringes of the cloud. The resulting flame front moves back toward the pit at a speed only slightly faster than a walk."
Well, I tried. Every dictionary I checked refers only to direct
solid->gas transition. I'm aware of the effect you describe, but
its not sublimation. See:
If you throw boiling water into the air at -32C, much of it evaporates instantly (the humidity is near zero), and some of the
larger droplets freeze, falling to the ground as ice. No liquid will hit the ground.
Volcabulary flames are about as pointless as they get, so I apologize for starting this one. Mea culpa. I was confusing LPG and LNG. (Some of the sources I looked at refered to liquid propane and butane is LNGs.) Those gases are denser than air. Correctly speaking, they are referred to as Liquified Petroleum Gases (LPG), not  Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). LNG is primarily methane,  which, as you say, is lighter than air.

Additionally, I would suggest that the US may be well served by resurrecting
the historic use of Letters of Marque in both the war on Terrorism and the
protection of our coastal environment. It is obvious that the Federal
government is facing many simultaneous missions that take precedence over
traditional offshore environmental protection activities. This necessary
overextension, arising from the war on terror, results in shortages of
vessels and crews required for environmental patrols. Letters of Marque,
last used during the War of 1812, effectively enabled privateers to destroy
the Barbary Pirates and is a concept whose time has come, again! American
Fishermen and merchant seamen idled by quotas, regulation, and predatory
foreign competition can be mobilized to patrol the marine environment. They
can also be authorized to seize terrorist assets and provide material
assistance to the families of Americans victimized by terrorism awarded
punitive damages by US courts. Such modern-day Privateers would be legally
deputized to act as agents of the US Courts, the President, Congress, or

Eric, I think you could nuance this a bit.
Ryan isn't supporting Bush's little war - the military
has plenty of comm channels for C&C which Ryan wouldn't be allowed near.
What he's doing is supplying US soldiers with an independent,
uncensored and unreviewed channel through which they can find
out outside views of the war, information which their superiors
won't pass down to them, and a means by which they can
pass back their own views and opinions. Frankly, I'm suprised
the brass are letting him do it.
How do you think the prison abuse photos got back to the US Would you rather the soldiers rely on Stars & Stripes for info
on the changing situation back home?
If anything, what Ryan's doing advances the so-called
'cypherpunk agenda' more than anything being done at the
ideologicaly pure but practically insignificant Sealand.
Just my opinions....

neccesarily be the authority which gets to decide
what OS and software the machine can run.
If you 'take ownership' as you put it, the internal

   Its fine assuming that moore's law will hold forever, but without that you can't really extrapolate a future tech curve. with *todays* technology, you would have to spend an appreciable fraction of the national budget to get a one-per-year "break", not that anything that has been hashed with sha-1 can be considered breakable (but that would allow you to (for example) forge a digital signature given an example)
   This of course assumes that the "break" doesn't match the criteria from the previous breaks by the same team - ie, that you *can* create a collision, but you have little or no control over the plaintext for the colliding elements - there is no way to know as the paper hasn't been published yet.

The scenario the gun-grabbers posit is someone

It appears that the Iraqi resistance fighters figured out that
of several of them simultaneously fire full-auto AK's in front
of a chopper flying overhead, sometimes they'll get lucky. Of
course, these are low, slow targets.
We're discussing a terrorist trying to take out a commercial
jet with a 50 BMG, right? Even at takeoff, a passenger
jet is moving at 150-200 mph, a *lot* faster than a clay
pigeon, or the choppers the Iraqis hit.
I understand that there is redundancy in the critical
components. Hitting the pilot AND copilot at takeoff
would probably be effective, but you've got one (1)
shot before its out of range, and its moving fast.
A tracer into a fuel tank may also be effective.
But that's not the 50 BMG scenario. The most effective
way to use the 50 BMG would probably be to hit an
engine intake rotor while the jet is still on the
ground, starting its takeoff roll. This probably
won't kill anyone, but would have a big economic
impact as people decided not to fly.
...but that's still a damn difficult shot. The
target is moving, the bullet has non-trivial
flight time (well over a second at long range).
Getting a first shot hit is highly improbable.
All in all, the 50 BMG vs jet scenario is just
plain bogus.
I honestly don't think that many politicians
wake up in the morning and think to themselves
'What rights can I erode today?'. I think it's
more 'what can I do that will make me *look*
good?' . It doesn't matter if their action is
actually effective, it matters that it makes
them appear to be 'doing something' and makes
for a good 5 second sound bite.
50 BMG rifles are used, very rarely, for
hunting. For an example, see:
More people are into very long
range (1000 yard and up) target shooting.
Those are the only 'legitimate' civilian
reasons to use a 50 BMG. It's like owning a
McLaren F1 - you can't use it much, but its
very, very, cool.
As a result, it's difficult for most people
to come up with a justification to own
one beyond 'because it's very, very cool'.
[I'm deliberately leaving aside the 2A
rights issue (which in a better world would
be then end of the argument) since it
doesn't seem to get much traction with
most politicians or sheeple any more].
50BMG rifles look very, very, tactical.
I've never seen one with a walnut stock.
They are the canonical 'scary looking gun'.
So, the politician sees a type of gun:
* Which theoreticly could be used to do Very
  Bad Things.
* Owned by a group of people too
  small to be significant voting block.
* For which its difficult to come up with
  a practical use.
* Which looks very photogenicly scary.
...and he or she thinks 'Wow, a lot of
people will feel safer it I ban these,
and I can make them think I'm protecting
them. Also, getting on TV with one of
these is a great visual.'
Actual reality doesnt enter it.

John Kelsey
A remarkable number of police deaths are 'own gun'
incidents, so the police do have a strong motivation
to use 'smart guns' if they are reliable.
In New Jersey, there is some kind of legislation
in place to restrict sales to 'smart guns', once
they exist. Other types would be banned. (Actually,
getting a carry permit in NJ is already almost
impossible, unless you're politically connected.)
This particular model seems to rely on pressure
sensors on the grip. This bothers me - under the
stress of a gunfight, you're likely to have a
somewhat different pattern than during the
enrollment process.
Many 'smart guns' also have big problems with
issues which arise in real life gun fights -
shooting from awkward positions behind cover,
one-handed vs two-handed, weak hand (righthander
using left hand, and vice versa, which can happen
if dictated by cover or injury), point vs
sighted shooting, and passing a gun to a disarmed
There are other systems which have been proposed;
magnetic or RFID rings, fingerprint sensors, etc.
The one thing that seems to be common to all of
the 'smart gun' designs is that they are
conceived by people with little experience in
how guns are actually used.
To look at a particularly ludicrous example, try
For a gun to work, it is just as important that
it fires when it should, as that it does not
fire when it shouldn't. A safety system
which delays firing by even half a second,
or which introduces a significant false
rejection rate (and 1% is way over the line),
is a positive hazard.
When the police switch to smart guns, and
have used them successfully for some time
(say, a year at least) without problems,
I'll beleive them ready for prime time.

Cynically, I'm not the slightest bit suprised that the police
are exempted: 'safety for the government, not for the people'.
A 1% false negative rate is too high. A 50% false positive rate is
*much* too high.
If it's combined with a rule to ban the transfer and/or
ownership of 'dumb' (ie, reliable) guns, then it's also
a backdoor gun confiscation policy.
I'm afraid that they may get away with it. Here in MA, the
only handguns which can legally be bought new are those on a
fairly short list compiled by the State Attorney General which
meet his arbitrary 'safety standards'. If I wanted, say, a
Pardini (a very expensive special purpose .22short target

The 'stolen gun' problems most of the so-called 'smart gun' proposals
are trying to address are the situation when a cop's own gun is
taken from him and immediately used against him, or a kid finding
one in a drawer. A determined and resourceful person can, given
time, defeat them all. After all, a 'determined and resourceful
person can build a gun from scratch with a small machine shop,
and many do (its not automatically illegal).
I link below to an absolutely bizarre proposal - apparently real
and claimed to be existing in prototype - by an South African
inventor to make an unstealable gun. Amongst other weirdness,
it fires the specially manufactured cartridges by firing a
laser into the glass-backed primer. As a result removing
the electronics would make it unusable. You'd have to
hack it instead.
This is a typical example of what I meant when I said that
'smart gun' proposals all come from people with zero
knowledge of how guns are used.
I strongly suspect that the gun in the picture is
a non-working prop.

That statement, in the OA, is not a quote - it's either

her by a NJ cop
So, we've established that a NYT journalist, writing on
a subject she probably knows nothing about, will regurgitate
any naively plausible bullshit she's fed. What else is new?
My statement that there are a significant number of cops
killed by their own guns, and a small but tragic number
of people killed accidentally playing with improperly stored
guns they find, remains true. These 'smart guns' could
reduce that problem, but making them mandatory is a
threat to freedom.

The end result is an otherwise intact disk in which the
