Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 8-Mar-96 Re: U.S. State Dept
critici.. by JFA T. QC, Canada at citene Self-censorship does happen, and it's a growing problem in the arts
community. (I'm not a commercial artist, so this is my understanding
from other panelists and speakers conference I spoke at last month.)
Making art more palatable or less "extreme" to curry favor with
corporate patrons, or to get that NEA grant, or to get that faculty
position is self-censorship, and it does happen.
