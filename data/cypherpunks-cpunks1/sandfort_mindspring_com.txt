Many of you have asked when CRYPTIC SEDUCTION would be available on video.
I have held off making copies available because I have been looking for a
good deal with a distributor.  I've decided not to wait any longer.  It will
soon be available through several sites on the Web.
Because of the heavy Cypherpunk influence/involvement in the making of
CRYPTIC SEDUCTION, I've decided to make a special Cypherpunk offer.  If you
would like to get an advance copy of CRYPTIC SEDUCTION, send a check or
money order for $19.95 (plus appropriate sales tax if you are in California)
Your check or money order should be made out to "Desdaemona Film Production
Trust."  If you have any questions, e-mail me or call me at 510-839-3441.

P.S.  Many of you have seen the soft-core version of CRYPTIC SEDUCTION on
the Spice Channel.  The video version, however, is hard-core.

I have to disagree.  AP is simply not workable in the real world.  It would
be trivial to spoof, scam or sting it.  The states over reacts for two
reasons.  (1) Paranoia--no matter how unlikely the threat, the bad guys are
compelled by their own guilty fear to take it seriously.  (2) To set an
example--The Chinese have a saying, "To frighten a dragon, kill a chicken."
Bell is no threat.  He's a powerless big-talker.  He's easy to squash, but
servers as an example of how far these government idiots are willing to go.
Remember, the government can only apply point force.  The only way they can
keep everyone in line is to co-opt the majority by assuming the guise of
moral/legal superiority, and by intimidation with an occasional
demonstration of ruthlessness.

Declan and Jim both seemed to have missed the point about Cypherpunks.  I've
attended physical meetings, off and on, since meeting  or  in the Bay
I'm not uncomfortable being called--or calling myself--a libertarian, but
one of the first things that the meetings revealed was that we had attendees
from all corners of the political arena.  And as a result, we soon saw that
nothing would ever get discussed--much less done--if we focused on our
political DIFFERENCES instead of our community of interest.
What is that community of interest?  It is the fight for privacy, against
those who would deny it to us, primarily through technological (as opposed
to political) means.  As long as we all kept our eyes on that prize, we had
no problem getting along.  When we got diverted into other areas of
politics/philosophy we ended up accomplishing nothing.
So, do the participants of this list wish to actually get something done
with regard to securing privacy, or shall we just spin our wheels in

I once had a friend that had the same myopic legal fixation as Choate.  She
had this love/hate relationship with the law.  On the once hand, she was a

things like become a notary to gain some sort of government-anointed
One of the things she did to play lawyer was repeatedly circle the block in
her car to make a left turn at an intersection with a sign that said, "No
Left Turn--Except Buses" or something like that.  When she finally got a cop
to ticket her, she was ecstatic.
In court, she pulled out a definition of a "bus" from a source totally
unrelated to the traffic code.  It said a bus was any vehicle capable of
carrying 6 or more people.  Well, her car seated 6 or more, so it was a bus,
right?  The judge was so amused, that he cut her loose.  She counted it as a
victory and thought her legal "reasoning" had won the day.
I only pray that I live long enough to see Jim Choate in the docket someday.
Of course, he's way too smart to hire a lawyer, so he'll demand a free
lawyer.  When that doesn't work, he'll begrudgingly representing himself.
He'll strut about, use big words he doesn't understand and waive around a

As a probable member of Tim's "Gang of Five" I am on the cusp between two
equally true facts about Cypherpunk "ideology" and the law.
1)  "Cypherpunks write code."  This metaphorical admonition tells us to make
the laws irrelevant by outrunning them with technology.  I couldn't agree
more.  I don't see much benefit in asking the nice lawmakers to do fuck us
so badly, please.  Better to take steps that put us outside of their reach.
2)  "Don't commit the crime if you can't do the time."  You have to know
what the law is likely to do so that you can "write code" in a manner that
is likely to be the most effective from a technological AND legal view.
Otherwise, you cannot do any sort of meaningful risk/benefit analysis.
It is on this second point that I had a very disappointing interaction with
Tim at a physical Cypherpunks meeting some years ago.  Tim was carrying a
concealed knife that did not comply with California's concealed carry laws.
I mentioned this to him, and he immediately interrupted my explanation by
saying, "I don't care what the law is, I'll do what I want."  (This from a
guy who slavishly insures and registers his car.  I guess some laws are more
equal than others.)
Now here's the funny part.  In California, (with some specific exceptions)
carrying a concealed knife is a felony, while carrying a concealed pistol is
a misdemeanor (for the first weapons offense).  So given the relative
severities of the laws, why in the world would you carry a knife instead of
a gun?  (Insert stupid joke here about an engineer bringing a knife to a gun

No Tim, what is utterly irresponsible is to make bellicose threats on this
list about what your response will be if masked ninjas invade your home.  If
they end up shooting you (and I think their is a significant likelihood that
they will), it will be in large part because of your macho siege mentality.
I "narced out" your behavior of several years ago.  If you are stupid enough
to still be carrying a knife illegally (when there are plenty of legal
options), then there is no helping you.  On your head be it.
More likely they are saying, "Ah fuck, I wish we'd known that before
Sandfort wised Tim up.  Now we'll just have to go with plan B and shoot him
when we raid his house with a trumped up search warrant."

Then tell them to get the hell off your property if they don't have a

Maybe yes, maybe no, but why not carry both then?  A legal knife and a
illegal (misdemeanor) gun rather than just your illegal (felony) knife?
Actually they were previously banned in California (at the time you were
carrying it) as dirks, or daggers.  Since then the legal definitions have
change and a push dagger, open worn is just dandy.  Which only goes to
support my point that one should know which laws one is obeying (or not).
Obviously, you have wised up on this issue because you are now quoting
chapter and verse:
Whoa, I'd like to see a citation on that one.  What really usually happens
in California is that the cops "confiscate" the gun and cut the detainee
loose.  Why?  Hey, a free gun is a free gun.  And they are particularly
useful to loan to guys you shoot who forgot to bring their own.  :'D
I did.  It only takes one.
You didn't teleport there Tim; quit quibbling.
If you want to please the cops, then carry a concealed folder.  Perfectly
legal under most circumstances.  Remember, that's what I was arguing
about--knowing the laws you are obeying (or not).
Good.  I'm glad to see you are now thinking about the legal issues that you
previously eschewed.
Assuming facts not in evidence.  I am not, nor did I complain about your
carrying of an illegal (then) knife.  I tried to tell you that it could get
you into trouble--unnecessarily--when there were better options available.

current beef.  What annoyed me way back when was your militant ignorance.
If you are ready to put that aside and listen to what Unicorn and others
tell you about your potential legal exposure, more power to you.
Tim, are you on crack or what?  Where do you come off suggesting that I have

Tim already is a target.  My minor comments do nothing to change his status.
Are those the only possible explanations you can come up with?  I find most
of Tim's insights useful and think he is a valuable member of the list.
Pointing out that he has his head up his ass on certain subjects is hardly
equivalent to having a "personal vendetta."  As to "crappy personality"

Huh?  Maybe I'd know what you were talking about if you'd actually answered

No warrant is friendly.  I've had the FBI stop by my house for a friendly
visit (no warrant).  Just for the fun of it (and to see what they were

questions and gotten some answers, they started asking ME some questions.

stay top-side.
OUR canarypunks, no matter what the miners say, loudly proclaim that the

Those who were on the list at the time will remember how Jim Bell

better, he was smarter than the FBI, he had "a solution," the Constitution
was on his side, etc.
EVERYTHING I said came true, NOTHING he said did.  Live and learn (or
don't).  Think of it as evolution in action.
As I said, Tim May is a special case.  Unlike Jim Bell (damn lot of "Jims,"
if you ask me) and the Three Stooges, Tim's ideas and opinions actually
bring value (other than just canary value) to the list.
Nevertheless, in the final analysis, Tim is also a canarypunk.  For what

His cowardice in failing to reproduce those requested passages (or even my

I agree with Dr. Evil about the unlikelihood of it ever happening, but if it
did, I think the intruder is toast.  In California, there is the presumption
that anyone in your house (at least after dark, though I'd have to research
that) is there with the intent of causing death or great bodily harm.  He
doesn't have to do anything overt like raise a crowbar.  So you can just
shoot first and ask questions later.
Having said that, that is a rebutable presumption.  If it can be shown that
you believed or had reason to believe the intruder was, in fact, some flavor
of cop, you cannot rely on the fear-of-death-or-great-bodily-harm
presumption.  For example, if he raised his hands and you heard him say,
"Don't shoot, I'm an FBI agent," you might lose the benefit of the
presumption.  (You DID hear him say it, right?)
In any event, someone will probably back-shoot you then or later, so the
legal aspects may be academic.  When the federal government can burn to
death over 80 innocent Americans (22 of them children) in broad daylight on
national television and skate, I don't think there is much they can do and
not get away with it.

the defender.  Prior to a few years ago, you had to make some showing of
fear of great bodily harm or death before you could shoot an intruder.  The
law was changed to make it presumptive that someone in your house was there
for those reasons.

I'm sure that "cost-effectiveness" has a role to play here.  I just don't
agree that the cost savings of parole are all that big a factor.  The US has
more prisoners per capital than just about anyone (I think the US is
surpassed by Russia and maybe South Africa).  So we've already made the
decision that we can afford to lock up a lot of people.
Also, the assumption that locking up more people comes at some sort of
linear increase in costs.  One of the simplest answers is to just overcrowd
the facilities "we" already have.
No, I think Tim and Sampo have the cart before the horse.  We have the
criminal laws we have because that feeds the government, not because we save
so much with parole.  Eliminating parole by overcrowding or by building
still more prisons would increase, not decrease human suffering.

Yes that IS the choice.  This is not a logical fallacy.  This is the real
choice real people have to make every day.  "Changing the system" is not an
individual option.  Right now, in the real world, prisoners have to decide
whether they are going to be "hard cases" and staying in the joint or of
"going along" and getting out sooner, albeit on parole.  Eliminating parole
should be the LAST thing done to reform the system.  Anything else merely
compounds the evil.
I'll go a bit further.  To the extent a libertarian society had prisons, I
think there would--and should--be a system of parole (i.e., "conditional
release") to help released inmates re-enter society.

That's really a separate problem having to do with our insane mandatory

folks, they are usually the ones convicted of really vicious crimes.
Well that would be nice, but why not focus in on the real problem, too many

I don't think I claimed that.  I said that the cost curve wasn't strictly
linear.  Before they release prisoners, the crowding must first become
unbearable.  So that means prisons are all running along the ragged edge of
overcrowding.  This makes parole a MUCH better deal for the prisoner, which
was my point.
Well if so, it certainly doesn't allow for your solution.  We have seen
countries and jurisdictions relax their drug laws, for example.  Remember,
the US repealed an anti-drug constitutional amendment.  If they can go

why mere statutes can't be undone.

One of the most common things you will find in Swiss homes, the SIG 90
assault rifle.  The Swiss Army comprises 450,000 men who are given their
service rifles and who have to complete a minimum of two weeks service each
year, serving from the age of 18 until they are 50 (this age will be dropped
to 45 soon).  After completing their service, the fully-automatic capability
of the rifle is permanently disabled, and the rifle is given back to the
former soldier who may keep it.  Soldiers are also issued a comprehensive
cleaning kit, three 20-round magazines, and a "corn-beef can" of 50 rounds
of 5.6mm ammunition, as well as a bayonet.  Swiss soldiers must practice
their marksmanship regularly under the terms of the Obligatory Rifle
Shooting Programme.  Switzerland has one of the highest rates of gun
ownership in the world, yet maintains a remarkably low homicide and armed

There are several possible answers to what you have written.  First, at

is the ballot box choice of their representatives.
That's theory.  Personally, I think the problem is the idea that we need
laws (i.e., the threat of violence) to address the problems in question.
I'm not sure what you are talking about.  What are the "forces of
capitalism" to which you refer?  Personally, I try to avoid the word
"capitalism" at all.  First, it's a pejorative Marxist term.  Second,
everybody seems to have a different definition.

Actually, it would fall under the definition of "great bodily harm," whether
you think so or not.  This is not a self-serving definition, you idiot, just
a legal one that you happen to disagree with.

and personal opinion.
It's a lot more comfortable than confronting the objective LSAT challenge.

Right, but Jimbo lives in Texas where the word is spelled "defense" not
"defence" as it is in England.  Just teasing the (ignorant) monkey.
It is educational (and it amuses me) to draw him out into parading his
ignorance and intransigence for all to see.  Of course, he won't admit he is
wrong directly, but when his stupid notions are repeatedly challenged, he is
forced to dig himself in deeper and deeper.  This makes it crystal clear to
all observers that his arguments have no merit.  If he is unchallenged, a
few folks might actually think he has something worthwhile to say.  So think
of it as a public service.
Now the real question is, does Jimbo realize he's making an ass out of
himself, or does he actually think he's scoring points?  If the first
alternative is true, it brands him as a detestable moral and intellectual
coward.  If the second is true, he's far stupider than I would have thought.
Of course the two options are not mutually exclusive...
The really sad thing about Jimbo is that he stands absolutely alone.  Each
time I, or someone else, gives him a real good ass kicking, taunt him, tease
and humiliate him, NO ONE ever jumps to his defense (or defence, for that
I've been told not to feed the trolls, once or twice someone has agreed with
a factual part of one of his statements and folks like you have said--in
effect--why bother, but no one has ever said anything like, "play nice" or
"cut the guy some slack, he's human too" or anything remotely SYMPATHETIC to
Jim Choate as a human being.  You have to be a pretty wretched human being
to evoke that little sympathy
However, as I think you realize, that would all change overnight if Jimbo
were to show some humility or moral/intellectual honesty.  If that were to
happen, I would be the first to cut him some slack.  As it is, though, I
have zero respect or sympathy for him and I will continue to cut him off at
the knees without remorse.

a) I'm Sandy Sandfort.
b) My job was never in jeopardy, not would that have stopped me if it had
been the only issue.  (I've quit job for less.)  The message in question was
a libelous lie, I personally knew to be false.  It was obviously designed
specifically to exploit the gapping flaw in the system under which I was
allowed to filter the list.
What was the flaw?  Originally, I approached John Gilmore with a plan I had
worked out to enforce civility and relevance on the list.  It did not
include any pre-filtering of content.  He didn't like my plan, and instead
offered me a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.  Under his plan, I would
personally pre-approve every message going to the filtered list.  So severe
was the problem on the list, that I foolishly agreed to abandon my plan and
go along with John's.  Unfortunately, that was a huge mistake; the rest is
One last word about John.  I think John has been, and continues to be, the
most effective and hardworking Cypherpunk in the world.  He's clever,
fearless and he puts his money where his mouth is.  Compared to him, most of
the other Cypherpunk luminaries are just big talkers (even not compared to
him, for that matter).  Yeah, I think John had his head totally up his ass
with regard to his choice to filter the Cypherpunks list.  Given his many
"good works," though, I've long since given him a pass on that little

Under the common law, defamation is a tort, not a crime.  Though some
jurisdictions may have a parallel criminal statute against defamation, when
one party sues another, it's civil, not criminal.
A good analogy would be "battery."  Under the common law, the cause of
action called battery was defined as an unwanted touching.  Case law has
filled out that definition with examples, exceptions, etc.
Most US jurisdiction also have a crime called battery.  So if you hit me,
the cops can arrest you and prosecute you for the crime of battery.
Independently, I may sue you for the common law tort of battery.
Remember OJ?--criminally prosecuted for murder, civilly sued for wrongful
death.  He skated on the first, lost on the second.  Why?  Different
standards of proof.  When the state goes after you, they have to prove their
case "beyond a reasonable doubt."  When an individual sues you, they have to
prove their case "by the preponderance of the evidence."  In engineering
terms, 98% vs. 51%.
All the rest that Jim wrote is gobbledygook derived from a misunderstanding
of how the common law works.

Wrong.  Damages have always been contemplated under the common law tort
system.  There are numerous and complex reasons that some torts have also
been "criminalized."
Sure, the Constitution is a document that outlines and limits the power of
the state over the individual.  The common law is the summation of the
rights and responsibilities as between individuals.  Apples & oranges.

Irrelevant, Jim has already conceded the point in his parenthetic aside.
Natural rights, at least that's what the framers of the Constitution
Other than the oddity of Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the like, there is no US
jurisdiction based on civil law, only the English common law.  One might as
well bring up the law of gravity as the civil law in this discussion.
Civil what?  The question makes no sense because it assumes facts not in
evidence.  Civil remedies are under the common law are created by courts not
a) Other than Louisiana, etc., there is no civil law jurisdictions in the
US.  Specifically, the federal courts are based on the common law system
b) The word Jim left out was "Congress" ("CONGRESS shall make no law..."

What I or Jim, believe is irrelevant in the

agree that Anglo-American jurisprudence is
based on the common law, the Constitution
notwithstanding.  That's good enough for me.

You're welcome, unfortunately, your analysis is still flawed.
Right.  You are confusing "statutes" and precedents.  Courts don't enact
laws, but they do create the "common law" through precedents.  Apples &

No quibbling, just explaining what the common law is.  Anyone who wants to
believe that the Constitution is precedent court ruling recognized under the
common law, is welcome to do so.  Trouble is, it just ain't so.  You can
woulda-coulda-shoulda all day long, but that won't change the facts.  You
can spend three years in law school and learn something, read a book or two

The reason you cannot think of such a situation is because there is none.
The common law is derived from appellate rulings.  If a lower court goes
against the common law, it will be overruled when it reaches the appellate
level (assuming it is appealed; lots of cases aren't, but they have no
bearing on similar future cases; only appealed cases do).  If they conform
to the common law, they will be affirmed on appeal and that will stand since
the issue has already been adjudicated once before and upheld on appeal.
Also as you figured out, there is little or no overlap between the common
law and constitutional admonitions against government action.  If you can
come up with a concrete example, we can discuss it.

I'm not sure your question is meaningful.  It's sort of like, "can God make

Well, contrary to the Subject, Choate's, assertions, the common law PRECEDED
the Constitution and was implicitly incorporated therein (as shown by the
Subject, Choate's, own recitation of the appropriate Constitutional
clauses).  So, in a sense, I guess you would be right in saying that the

Word of the Day for Tuesday October 26, 1999:
inchoate \in-KOH-it\, adjective:
1. Recently, or just, begun; beginning.
2. Partially but not fully in existence or operation; existing in its
elements; incomplete; imperfectly formed; as, "a vague inchoate idea".
Writers basically work by instinct - I think you have only an inchoate sense
of what you're doing.
--John Gregory Dunne, quoted in "How John Gregory Dunne Puts Himself Into
Books," New York Times, May 3, 1982
You take on a project because of the feeling, perhaps inchoate, that it may
in some way contribute to your deeper understanding of the larger-scale
research program you have chosen as your life's work.
--Christopher Scholz, Fieldwork: A Geologist's Memoir of the Kalahari
Still, if I'm honest, the most thrilling moments all came early, in the
Fifties and Sixties, when the music was a primary focus of my energy,
shaping my desires, coloring my memory, and producing the wild fantasy,
widely shared, that my generation was, in some inchoate way, through the
simple pleasure we all took in rock and roll, part of a new world dawning.
--James Miller, Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947-1977
Inchoate is from Latin inchoatus ("only begun, not finished, incomplete"),
past participle of inchoo, inchoare, which is an alteration of incoho,
incohare, to begin.

@_subject: Nifty secret bank system 
I ran into a western version of "hawala" about 15 years ago.  It was a
"blocked currency" service offered by a financial group.  Here's how it
If you live in a currency-blocked country (South African was one, I think it
still might be) you couldn't legally move more than a certain amount out
money out of the country.  To get around this, you would be asked to tear a
small denomination piece of paper money (e.g., a 1 rand note) in half.  You
would keep one half and the financial group would get the other half.  Both
halves of the bill would have the same serial number, of course.
Later, you would get a call telling you where to take the cash you wished to
move out of the country.  At the appointed time and place an agent of the
financial group would meet you.  To prove he was the right guy, he would
present the group's half of the bill.  You would give him the money and the
next day an equivalent amount would be on deposit in an account in your name
in whatever country (and currency) you specified.  The fee for this was
usually just the normal money changer's exchange rate.  Of course, the
original cash never left South Africa, just as the cash in the hawala system
never leaves the countries in question either.
One more aside.  For a brief period when New Zealand was heavily socialist,
the government wanted to stop people from traveling (and spending money)
abroad.  Instead of banning travel, which would have caused a shit storm of
controversy, thy just limited the amount of cash that could be taken out of
the country to something like a few hundred bucks.  Of course, resourceful
Kiwis just used their credit cards...

Very easy.  It's been done numerous times in murder-for-hire cases.
I'm sure the authorities will be more than happy to comply.  By the way,
Nomen, what do you know about death certificates?  Don't you think someone
going to the courthouse and asking to see one would come under some unwanted
attention under the circumstances?
Duh.  That's just ONE of the reasons AP won't work.
So now AP needs a new entity to be workable (check out Occam's razor,
Nomen).  Please explain who would become a DCA and how they would make money
being a DCA.  I'm sure I (or most any other Cypherpunk, for that matter)
will be able to point out the holes in your argument in a couple of minutes.
Have they expressed an interest?  It is naiveti in the extreme to seriously
think they would even consider it.
Close, but no cigar.  Another 30 seconds of thought on the matter reveals
the flaws.  So first you need a DCA to make AP work.  Now you need a
hitherto not required delay for the theoretical DCA to do it's job.  So a
potential hit man has to think, "Maybe this guy is dead, maybe not.  Maybe
the people who've pledged money will pay me if I off the guy, maybe not.
Now that it looks like he's dead, I can either wait up to two years or I can
assume he's dead, put myself at considerable risk trying to find him (under
heightened security if he IS alive), kill him without getting caught and
wait two years to collect my bounty.  Oh wait, if I kill a guy who everyone
already think is dead, I'll a) have to prove he was alive, b) prove that I
killed him, c) prove that the day I killed him was the correct date and d)
still wait two years for the imaginary DCA to verify the death."
Oh yeah, that'll work.
Mr. Target only stays hidden for two years if he wants to collect the reward
himself.  If you just wants to fuck with the AP system, he disappears for a
few weeks, reappears and does it again.  Rinse and repeat as often as
needed.  What hit man it really going to run the risks involved?  What
"investors" (you said pledges, that's not an investment) are going to stay
on for the long haul?  And what about the "free rider" problem?
Yeah, that'll really motivate a hit man.

Inchoate is remedial logic course fodder:
By this same Inchoate "logic," no one is free because, by our nature, we
cannot fly like a bird.  Political freedom means the opportunity to make
choices within the context of our circumstances.  Yeah, the "sweatshop"
workers' choices are lousy, but they have, in fact, made their choice to
improve their lives by working in the "sweatshops" as opposed to starving on
their own retched little plots of land.  Good for them.

Tell that to the 7th kine.  In reality, subsistence (this word means
something) farmers were mostly chronically malnourished--even in the good
times--and died in droves whenever the sun didn't shine or the rain didn't
fall.  I don't consider that doing "alright."
Can you be more specific?  "Corporate welfare" such as making the rain fall
or what?
You tell me.  It would appear that either you are wrong about the economic
viability of their farms or they are somehow acting against their own best
interest.  Subsistence farmers are going to the cities because they
(correctly) understand that to do so increases their standard of living.
Even assuming, arguendo, that this is true (evidence, please), this is not a
failure of the market or the fault of the "sweat shop" operators.  In fact,
the "sweat shop" operators are the only heroes in this scenario.  They are
at least providing something better than the dislocated farmers would have
had otherwise.  Good for them.

I have NO IDEA what this strange post has to do with the original question.
I'm a libertarian.  As such, I see no problem in doing well by doing good.
Just because I would jump at $5 million (plus Witness Relocation) to finger
Bin Laden does not mean I would do something evil for that amount or more.
Remember, the original question was, would a $5 million reward plus a new
identity under the Witness Relocation Program be enticing enough to get
someone to roll over on Bin Laden.  My best guess is 'yes' and I merely used
myself as an example.
Look, I don't CARE about the purity of the motives of someone who would give
up Bin Laden.  The only question in my mind is whether or not there is
somebody who would do it for the stipulated inducement.  That was--and

Thanks, but I'd go a bit further.  The percentage of humans who would be
capable of such evil has to be vanishingly small.  Unfortunately, that
percentage is not zero so this sort of thing continues to happen.
We have to assume it because it demonstrably exists.  The trick then is, to
make the costs greater or the benefits less.  Easier said then done, but
those are our only alternatives.
I think a much strong argument can be made that those who do not believe in
an afterlife would be more deterred than those who do.
Yeah, but it's that once that counts forever.  In any event, that's the
situation in which we live.  There will always be that tiny minority that
will do evil.  The rest of us are left to monkey with the cost/benefit to
reduce the incidences of such evil.  Life goes on.

Who said anything about profit?  The point under discussion was cost/benefit
analysis.  Don't engage in Inchoate over-simplification.  Neither cost nor
benefit is limited to monetary profit or loss.
Here's a silly example.  Let us suppose the terrorists are Muslims.  It has
been reported that the body of one of the terrorist pilots has been
recovered.  Perhaps future Muslim terrorists might deem costs too high if
that body were fed to pigs and the resulting pig shit dropped on Kabul (or
maybe that would just increase the "benefit" of killing more innocents).  In

Apples and oranges.  There is a world of difference between targeting
innocents (the focus of my post) and targeting military targets with
resultant innocent casualties.  If a gunman grabs a human shield and starts

was surrounded by a high chain-link fence with a razor wire on the top (if

Anyway, one day someone came to the gait and sounded the buzzer.  Robert
asked them through the intercom who they were and what they wanted.  They
said they were from the IRS.  When Robert asked them if they had an
appointment, there was a long silence followed by the statement, "No, but

Mr. Heinlein turned off the intercom and buzzer and went back to his
