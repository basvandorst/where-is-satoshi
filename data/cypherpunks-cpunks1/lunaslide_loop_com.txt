I think there is a middle ground that you may have missed.  Let's see...
The cypherpunk view seems to be that eveyone *should* use forms of
encryption for passing packets along on the internet.  It works best when
the majority of people are using, but no one is forced to encrypt their
email.  People still send postcards, right?  No matter what percentage of
users on the net use encryption, there will always be those who will
exercise their right to send open, plain text messages.  It is our right to
choose *to* encrypt that we are fighting for, not a general mandate that
all use crypt.
As for the law's take on this matter, under the constitution, they have no
right to tell us that we cannot use encryption in sending our messages.
They also have no right to tell us that we cannot teach others how to use
it, develop easier ways to implement it so that eventually it will be a
no-brainer to use, say that we are criminals because we opt for our right
to privacy, or ask us to give up that right to privacy because we are using
a new medium.  One issue that may come up is that the law cannot make us
give our passwords so that they may use our keys to open our documents
because it would be self-incrimination, however, they can serve warrants to
search our software and documents.  In their search, they will be able to
try and break our passwords to gain access to the files.  If they cannot,
it is their tough luck.
I don't think that I am stating a position of cypher-anarchy, but
advocating a position of personal privacy guaranteed by the Fourth
Amendment.  I don't think that wide-spread use of cyptography would cause
anarchy.  Would foreign govt. be able to slpi stuff by our govt. because
they can use encryption?  Sure, like they aren't already doing that right
now.  The US govt. seems to be saying "Hey, no fair!  I can't see your
stuff anymore.  You can't do that!"  when all along, no one has been able
to see their packets because they are encrypting it.
There are still ways for them to gain access too.  Don't tell me they can't
set up peeping toms to record keystrokes.  Certainly they can do this on
ppl's machines.  It would be more difficult, but that is the whole point.
It should be sufficiently difficult for them to tap so that to tap freely
would be infeasable for them to do, just like steaming open every envelope
that comes through would be infeasable.  They can only go after the real
suspects because it is feasable to do only that.
In essence, what I am saying about the govt. is that thy are crying wolf.
They can still be efficient in their duties without wholesale access to all
the data streams.  They want the power to monitor far more traffic than
they could ever get warrants for and they know it.
I likewise invite you to chip at the cracks in my reasoning as it will
improve our arguments in general.  Freedom is power.  God save the Citizen!

I don't think that you understand one thing.  If we (the users of the
internet) say that X-THING is unacceptable on the internet, we open up the
floodgates for everything else that ppl what to censor.  There are better
ways to keep children from looking at sites and spams like the one you
posted.  Parents.  It's their responsibility to keep their children from
getting into this stuff on the net.  If we allow the govt. to take care of
our issues and do not take responsibility for them ourselves, we deserve to
have a big brother who can take care of us (see what I mean?)  No control
can be given to the govt.  If it comes down to it, we can have a rating
system like the movies and music.
Our lists are moderated, BTW, so that we don't have to wade through a bunch
of irrelevant data while trying to read about the lists/newsgroups topic.
Some of my favorite groups are alt groups, and as much as I hate having to
read about Grubor all the time (please ship him off to a dessert isle), the
moderation would limit the scope of the groups and interesting, sometimes
relevant pseudotopics would be gone.  I want the psudotopics!  That's where
some of the best threads get started!  But moderated groups have their
place too.  Who wants to read a bunch of trolls while trying to read a
science group.  And soc.support groups would not be of much use if flamers
and lusers kept posting disruptive and disturbing articles.  But in all the
cases here, it is we, the users, who decide what stays and what goes.
Peace to all.

These exceptions are noted.
I would want the govt. to understand what I am sending them and I would
want to understand what they are sending me.  Hell, they can have my public
key too ;-)  But I don't see how they could exercise control simply because
I am communicating with them.  They cannot come blow my door down or even
slap my hand if they know I use encryption in all of my other
transmissions.  Perhaps I do not understand your point.  They can perhaps
control the communication between them and me, but not between me and
everyone else.
Employers nor universities have any jurisdiction over whether you use
encryption in your transmissions while using their networks unless it
specifically does not allow it when you first agree to have an account with
them.  Even in that case, they would be hard pressed to enforce it on a
university wide basis.  I would hope that employers would be smart enough
to encourage the use of encryption for their employees, even if they are
personal messages.  It would decrease their competitions chances to
intercept and decode the important, sensitive info because it would be
immersed in even more, unimportant info that is encrypted as well.
The govt. has control over the universities in that they are the ones who
fund them.  If the govt. denied funds to a given college because they did
not regulate the type of encryption, or alieviate the encryption use
entirely, what reasoning would they give to the schools board and the
public for restricting something that is not against the law and is, in
fact, protected by a constituional amendment.  It would not fly with the
I don't quite understand your meaning.  I am a merchant and I encourage my
customers to use PGP when they send information over the internet, whether
to me or to anyone else.  I explain to them the reasons for this, assisted
by Mr. Zimmermann's excellent analogy of the postcard/envelope difference.
Most are business people and readily accept the reasoning and are willing
to incorperate it into their dealings.  To respond to this point, I would
need to understand it better.  What is not what Mastercard, et al approves?
The encryption?
Indeed, there would be some impact from what point out, however, it would
not be enough pressure to suppress the encryption movement unless it became
painfully, and obviously, unconstitutional.  Law is optimally there for us
to redress grievences.  There will be skirmishes on the legal front for the
next 5 or 6 years, as far as I can see, but eventually the Surpreme Court
will set enough precidents that procecutors will be left with little power.
I don't think this is an optomistic view, but a realistic one based on the
current events and on decisions in related matters by the court in the
Comments?  Bring 'em on! :-)

@_subject: Reasons in support of crypto-anarchy WAS Re: Why am I	  wrong? 
You all should have a copy of this, so I won't waste bandwidth posting it
again.  If you didn't read it, I encourage you do to so, no matter what
your initial reaction is.  It is a facinating proposal and it brings to
mind a multitude of questions about privacy, anonymity, ethics and the
nature of human beings in general.
Now, in respose to Mr. Bell.  As I stated above, I found your proposal
absolutely facinating, to say the least.  As with many others, I'm sure, it
struck an initial chord in me that tempted me to disregard it out of hand.
However, I was determined to read it through thoroughly and without bias.
I have done so and I have the following thoughts about it.
The plan it self is feasable, and with more thought, all the wrinkles could
be ironed out.  I am impressed with the detail of it.  I would be curious
to see what an open minded laywer would say about it's legality under close
However, I must point out, and I'm sure you realize this, that it would not
be adopted by the public at large for some time to come, or more likely
never.  There are too many people who believe that it is wrong to take a
life for any reason and that no action justifies death.  I count myself
among these people.  The barganing power of death is indeed great, but some
would still realize that a vote would make them responsible, at least in
part, for a murder.  There is an ethical stumbling block here that may
never be overcome.
Further, I don't believe you have enough support for your claim that other
targets would not be sought.  It is one thing to say that enough people
won't vote for someone picked out of the phone book, but what if the
predicted individual is a doctor who performs abortions, or an activist for
gay rights (or *against* gay rights), or Bill Gates ;-).  There are also
the individuals who are trying to bring about change in society that is
unpopular, but is still in the interest of humanity.  Abraham Lincoln
surely would have been killed by this system, for example.  Also, big
corporations would be able to cut down their political enemies such as
envornment activists, fair business practice activists and competetors'
high ranking officers.  Even if only one person in charge of such a
business were to put out a digital contract, he would have no problem
suppling the money for the hit.  People who have tried to make changes for
humanity that went against the social norm at the time are revered today
for their efforts.  In this system, they would likely be assasinated.
Nothing would ever change because people are always afraid of change and
afraid of things they do not understand and the people who fight that
ignorance will likely be killed.  Your statement that Organization B, the
one that collects for any target, is not well supported.  They would still
be doing *plenty* of business, in spite of the higher prices.
Organization B would thrive, make no mistake.  And the people who would be
getting in on all the action are the rich.  All the politicians who oppose
their interests would be hit immediately.  Anyone trying to change the
status quo would be eliminated.  Why do you think we are still using
combustion engines in the last decade of the 20th century?  We could have
had better alternatives 20 years ago, but the oil companies would loose out
so they have either bought out these ideas or had killed the inventors and
bought their patents and are sitting on them.  A capitalist economy does
not always breed competition that brings out the best and most desireable
products because some advancements are bad for all the businesses involved
in that market.   Big business and the rich would benifit the most from the
Assination Politics model.
 But what if OrgB stops taking donations for "predictions" for
"Non-Initiation Of Force Principle" (NIOFP) offenders?  Some other
organization will crop up to take their place AND the people operating OrgB
could be hit for their "ethical" action.  There is simply too much
opportunity offered by OrgB type organizations for people to pass up.  They
will not let the higher prices stop them.
If the answer to that problem is to regulate the lists of "victims", then
the next question is who are these people who are regulating and what
guidelines are they following?  Who decides who gets to be the moderators?
Could there be exceptions to the (NIOFP)-offender standard?  Who would they
be and why?    Could the organizations be anonymous as well?  How would the
money be transmitted to them in that case?  How can we trust or redress
grivances with an organization?  There are still many concerns regarding
the organizations.  If the organizations fail, the whole system fails.
That's all I can think of at the moment.  Like I said before, once one can
get past the bias, it is an endlessly intriguing proposal bristling with
questions and issues concerning our very beings.
This is precisely why I would like to know if I may take a copy of your
proposal to my ethics class.  I think this is a great topic for discussion
and I would like your approval.

A good point, however, people do get the strange idea that killing someone
in war is not murder.  They also get the idea that when the govt. executes
someone, that that is also not murder.  I know that that is a personal
opinion, but I know also that I am not alone in my belief and to overcome
the number of people who agree with me to make a system such as Mr. Bells'
feasable would not be possible (I hope!)  If such system did succeed, the
citizens who spoke out against it on an ethical basis would find themselves
targets!  I do hope that those who do agree with the death penalty are not
so callous that they would execute their fellow citizens for disagreeing
with them.  We are, after all, fellow citizens of this country.  We would
be right back to where we started, an Orwellian society living in the face
of fear for what we believe, and that is *not* freedom.

A note here...my dad also did not go to jail for two years and get fined
$100,000 when I weasled my way into his closet, without his knowledge, and
found his Playboys at age five!
I didn't see anything really wrong with that part of the bill.  What it
will encourage is advertisers to withdraw from the more violent shows, and
in turn will encourage television producers to prefer funding less violent
shows.  Since I don't watch television that often anyhow, it won't affect
me very much.
I do see where it will deny those who wish to see such shows the violence
they wish to see.  This is an issue, and it is indirectly caused by the
bill, but it can not be used effectively against the govt. because they did
not directly outlaw violence.
It is particularly the CDA which boils my blood.  One other concern,
however, is that the lifting of restrictions on who can compete for what
will result in mergers and buyouts of internet providers and that when only
a few major companies own the bulk of the industry, the consumers will
suffer from content restriction, technological lag and possibly price
gouging.  I note the car, oil, software and media industries as a few
examples.  For example, journalists have traditionally been in support of
free speech and civil rights; they are, for the most part, rather liberal.
However, they, particularly those in television journalism, have been
notably absent in this battle over net censorship and have definitely not
been there to support us.  In fact, they have even spoken to our cause's
detriment on many occasions, by the slant of their pieces!  I can only
attribute this logically to the fact that the internet takes attention away
from their industry.  The internet competes with television and print as an
information source, and this the owners of the media do not want.  It's
sort of an unspoken conspiricy (appologies, I've already been accused of
turning this into ConspiricyPunks once before:-)
Nontheless, those are some of my concerns over the telcom bill aside from
the obvious CDA.

@_subject: Why am I wrong? 
Do you mean readable by "controlled"?  I thought I knew what you meant by
that :-)  If you do mean readable, I don't see how that would make a
difference since so many people would still be encrypting their mail.  If
you mean controled as in being able to encrypt messages would be
controlled, that the govt. would have final say over whether one could
encrypt or not, then unless they pass legislation specifically outlawing
encryption, or encryption not readable by them, they could have no such
control.  Even if they did legislate, they could not enforce reliably
because to many would be breaking that law anyway.  Plus, the law would
(should, he says kneeling and praying) be struck down as unconstitutional
by the fourth.
Perhaps I had better.  I do know that if employers do have jurisdiction,
then my point about employers encouraging encryption should still hold
(barring legislative prohibition).  If it does not, then I conceed that you
are correct in saying that it would *affect* traffic, but it would not
totally control it.  As for universities, the traffic here would be
affected as well, as you say.  There would still have to be some
justification for imposing such a restriction and it would be demanded by
the students and the parents of the students, but it still could be
sucessful (how frightening this is!)
I think that the comming standards announced by credit companies will take
care of secure transactions, and I still don't see where the govt. would
have to do with controlling traffic here.  Just as we have many credit
cards, we will have many online accounts, each with their methods of
secure, verifiable trasactions.  Methods for payment and security will
become increasingly easy to use and software will be written to accomidate
these features.
The debates roll on...

@_subject: Privacy Without Tears 
I've already talked to Bruce through private email and told him I would
start working on a peice for Mac users.  We are on a quest to get people to
use PGP, and it does not have anything to do with platform wars.  If you
have comments, take it to me in private emails.
The point of posting this is a) to let Mac readers of this list know that
they can refer to their Mac friends to the link for info and b)because I
had an idea after talking to Bruce of a great way to get the word spread
even further...
If everyone not only has a link to these pages in text, but also has their
"PGP secured!", or similar little graphic on their pages, linked to these
sites as well, it would save a lot of people a lot of redundant explaining
and it would help spread the word about PGP like wildfire to the masses.
You could also put a "Click for more info on Pretty Good Privacy(tm)" right
next to it to get more people to look.  _This_ is the way to get widespread
attention to and usage of PGP.  The pages on PGP would be linked to each
other and to pages on freedom of speech and privacy and the word would go
far.  By placing a link on your page to the PGP page through the graphic,
you will be placing a link to dozens, eventually hundreds, of pages
detailing PGP as well as sources dedicated to freedom and privacy.
Someone on the list made a comment a bit ago about just having regular old
text on the site to say "PGP secures", but people respond to the graphics
more than anything on web pages.  They want to be able to click everything.
This would be the key.  In the early days of Christianity in Rome,
Christians would sometimes communicate to each other by the use of the
small simple "fish" illustration that you see on cars everywhere.  This
will be our symbols power as well, the communication of a message.

Why should businesses cooperate with and help protect a govt that it's
needs would be better met without their existance?  Eve in the near future
during which busniesses will play by _most_ of the rules, those businesses
that own most of the net will not shut it down because it conflicts with
their business interests in a _major_ way.  Shutting down the internet for
even a day would loose these people so much money and time that if the govt
were to ask them to shut it down, they would seriously believe that they
are joking.  They would laugh, and the govt wouldn't be able to do shit
about it.
The net is something that has grown like ivy in an ivy-league school; it
can never be eradicated.  Too many people rely on it, it is too big an
income for big business and none of those businessed could shut it down
completely.  Routing errors, misplaced domains, sure, but the net would
survive and it would heal it's own wounds.

I believe that most of us on this group are here because we have principles
that compel us to fight for our freedom and privacy.  For me, those
principles are strong enough that if to die fighting for them is my fate,
than that is how I will give my life.  To lay down my arms, to give up
before I'm dead or the war is over is to bring shame and dishonor upon
myself that I could not bear to live with.  I would never be able to look
my unborn children in the eyes again because I would know that I did not do
my part in the fight; I did not stand my ground.

I'll just come out admit right now that I read Wired.  Yeah, sue me.  But
my point is that there was an article in 4.01 (January) on page 86 titled
"Is Government Obsolete?  Is the free market all we need to build a robust
and democratic political economy for the 21st century?"
I think the govt sees the beginning of the end.  They will not be
completely done away with, but they will lose the vast amount of power that
they now have and be reduced in size till they are functioning as a
mediator of disputes between this country and others, a regulator of some
laws involving ecology, labor laws, and so on.  But they will have lost
control over the direction of the nation.  Will the nation be able to be
cohesive without them?  I don't even think our concept of what a nation is
will be the same when that time eventually does come.
One think does stand to reason though, when govt gets in the way of
business, govt eventually gets run over.  Regulating the net in content
brings them one step closer to obsolescence.  The govt is not yet in it's
death throwes, but it has seen it's own fate.  The net regulation is one
more feeble attempt at avoiding destiny.  King Laius will not avoid his
fate by sending his son away this time, just like he didn't the first time.
"...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created

Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of

Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ---That
whenever any Form of government becomes destructive to those ends, it os
the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying it's foundation on such priciples and organizing it's

long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
the forms to which they are accostomed.  But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to
reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future

Very convienient.  Why don't they just put bar codes on our foreheads at
birth and get it over with?
Seriously, what I want to know is how they plan to make one set of
information (drivers licence, soc security number) inaccessable to other
institutions like health and pharmacy.  This is even more of a concern if
the card becomes a method of payment.  Would each have it's own secret key
that would unlock only the relavent info?  That would be a big keyring.
Access time for a key and keeping the keys up to date in all the databases
around the country would have to be done.

}b) set forth certain limitations on that sovereign ("Congress shall make

}c) define certain duties of the sovereign (regulation of foreign commerce...)
I cut the rest of your post because the main premise is not correct.  The
goal was not to create a sovereign government.  It clearly states in the
Declaration of Independence that the power belongs entirely to the people
and that the government is a group of officials who are elected to do the
bidding of the people.  They have what power we give to them
(theoretically, of course.  They don't seem to listen much, do they?).
sovereign n. 1. A person, governing body, etc., in whom the >supreme power
or authority is vested.<  adj. 1. Exercising or possessing supreme
authority or jurisdiction.  2. Independent, and free from external
authority or influence: a sovereign state.
This is not what our government is.  They are liable to us and the ultimate
power lies with us.  They are not independent and free from our influence.
The opening statements of the Declaration of Independence, before they get
to the complaints, outlines the the founding fasthers intentions in forming
a government of their own.  I have already quoted it in another post.
"...to institute new Government, laying it's foundation on such principles
and organizing it's powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely
to effect their Safty and Happiness."  The government seems more intent on
_affecting_ our safty and happiness.
It's been said before and it will continue to remain true, the govt scares
up a new boogyman to frighten the public into giving it more power until
finally the people do not have enough power to take back the power thwy
gave to the govt.  Democracy becomes facism through fear.  What really
confuses me is how most people in this country do not understand the logic
behind this.

What's really funny here is that the harder you make it for kids to get

Parents who impose restrictions on their children using all sorts of
methods (hiding stuff, using the channel lock out deal, blah blah blah) are
challenging their children to use deduction and reasoning to get at what
they want.  In the case of the v-chip, channel lockout, site blocking
software, etc., the parents are turning their children into the most
horrendous creatures of all...OH!  Cypherpunks!

I too would like to see a purely democratic process rather than a

question is, what do we keep of govt?

everyone in the country to vote on specific legislation and how would they
get access to that legislation?  I think _this_ is a cypherpunk topic for

reasonable to hope that that will be the effect.  Our doing our part to
make enough noise about it will only help our cause.

No, but I do dispute that the _U.S. Government_ is sovereign.  I'm not
going to write why all over again, since you seem to have convieniently
snipped the rest of my post, rather than answer it.  You are commiting a
straw man fallacy.  I didn't say that the nation isn't soveriegn, I said
that the government is not sovereign.  Yes, there is a difference.
}The three branches of the government were set up to ensure that "supreme
}power" would never rest with a single entity, yet taken together they do have
}that power.
The three branches are a system of checks and balances to counter the the
immergence of one sovereign pwoer.  See, it is actually built into the
constution that the govt cannot be sovereign!
}Congress and the Senate are the legally empowered representatives of the
}people. In that they do have the "power of the people" to make decisions
}on what is right and what is wrong within limits. That too is defined in
}the constitution.
The Congress is the Senate and the House, and they are given specific
powers by the people to govern themselves in relation to the job in Article
1, Sections 1-7 and to govern the people in Article 1, Sections 8-10.  The
powers given are very specific in nature and involve mostly limited
legislative powers and taxing abilities.
The President is given his rights and duties to govern the people in
Article 2, Sections 2 and 3 and they include the power to command the army
and navy, give pardons, make treaties and appoint people to positions as
Judges, Ambassadors and the like.  He has the duty to give a State of the
Union address from "time to time" to inform and ask for recomendation and
consideration on matters ofhis choosing.  He also has the right to conviene
both houses of congress to discuss matters.
In Article one, he is also given the power of the veto.
The Judicial branch, and particularly the Supreme Court, is given the power
to rule on matters concerning the court involving laws and disputes.  They
have the power to refute laws and the duty to adhere to the principles of
the constitution.
The people have the right to dissent and may petition the govt for a
redress of grievances as dictated by Amendment one.  If they are not given
satisfaction, they still have the right to free speech and press so that
they may share their dissent with one another and affect the outcome of the
next election.
The Fourth Amendment, of course, protects the "...right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable
searches and seizures..."  Clearly the govt cannot be sovereign if this is
}Take the CDA. I do believe that it is unconstitutional but that Congress/
}Saxplayer had the *right* to pass the law just as the Supreme Court has the
}right to declare it to have been outside the power of the Congress to do so
}(which I expect). Somehow it works.
But ultimately it is the people who decide, and the people are not one with
the government.  The people have influence over the government, therefore
the government cannot be sovereign.
The first part of the Declaration of Independence indicates that it was
never the intent of the founding fathers to create a sovereign government,
refuting your nonsensical statement about it being "a given."
I ended up restating almost my whole case anyway.  But that's ok, cause
I'll just keep explaining until you understand it.
