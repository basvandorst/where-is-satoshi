I think this is a great question. I talked to a gentleman from South Africa
last year at Where 2 who claimed to be a GSM expert. He said that GSM can
locate you within something like 3 meters with no GPS support just using
the towers, and that this was built into the GSM spec. He spoke of a case
in South Africa where they located some sort of criminal using the GSM
He said that CDMA on the other hand, cannot locate so precisely.
So, to me, A-GPS was designed to make CDMA users locatable to the same
degree as GSM.
As an aside, does anyone know which type of cell phones are more lethal?
