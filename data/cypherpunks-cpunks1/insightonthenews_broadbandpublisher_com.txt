Folks, best wishes on Americaï¿½s 226th birthday! Here in Washington weï¿½re keeping our spirits high and our eyes peeled as we prepare to celebrate with the rest of the country. Letï¿½s hope all the security precautions turn out to be a waste of time. Anyway, check out Arnaud de Borchgraveï¿½s stunner on al-Qaedaï¿½s e-mails if you have the time  Weï¿½ve got a gourmet menu of new articles for you today.

Peter Pitts asks if Americans have checked their pockets.
WHY ARAFAT WANTS IT ALL
Mona Charen tells us that there was a time when most Palestinians truly wanted a separate state. Arafat never did. And while accepting Nobel prizes and red carpets from governments the world over, he has remade the Palestinians in his own image. They are now a nation of terrorists.
HARRY BINGHAM---PROFILE IN COURAGE
This U.S. Foreign Service officer is finally being recognized, after he ignored his bosses at Foggy Bottom and saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis, at the cost of his career.
DO WE NEED ANOTHER CABINET-LEVEL BUREAUCRACY?

They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director George Tenet received a coded "red alert" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv headquarters that presented what he called a "worst case scenario" -- that China would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.

INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!
New Stories From Insight on the News Are Now Online.
Folks, we dug up some unbelievable al Qaeda stories this week. Richard Tomkins will set Americans to scratching their heads again with his report on how the Pakistanis have arrested six more Americans for being Taliban or al Qaeda fighters.  And it seems that the U.S. and Iran are having secret confabs again over Iranï¿? support for al Qaeda and some overdue U.S. weapons deliveries.  Thatï¿? it for this week. Until next time, from The Bunker, I remain your newsman in Washington.
PAKISTAN: MORE AL QAEDA AMERICANS ARRESTED?
Richard Tomkins and Anwar Iqbal reveal that as many as a half-dozen men "of U.S. origin" have been captured in the tribal areas of Pakistan.
IRAN, RUSSIA AGAIN ARGUE OVER NUKES
Ken Timmerman reports that the dispute is now focused on a Russian assertion that Iran has already obtained nuclear weapons.

INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!
New articles from Insight on the News are now online
Folks, last week we put out our Spring Double Issue, so you wonï¿? find a new issue today. But you will find some outstanding stories you may have missed. . . . Ralph de Toledanoï¿? blistering expose of the ACLU,  Jamie Dettmerï¿? remarkable story on damage control inside the FBI and CIA post Sept. 11,  and Doug Burtonï¿? Symposium on whether the NEA discriminates against its religious members  name just a few. Until next time, Iï¿? still your Newsman in Washington.
CIA AND FBI PLAY THE BLAME GAME
Jamie Dettmer reveals that the fabled Clinton "war room," with its alert media reflexes and craftiness in unleashing quick ripostes to potentially damaging stories, had nothing on these spooks and G-men!
DOLLARS AND SENSE
Sean Paige writes that having blundered once already with a Susan B. Anthony dollar coin that confused people by looking and feeling too much like a quarter, the folks in Washington seem to have produced yet another dollar coin that hasn't caught on with anyone other than coin collectors.
TAXPAYERS GETTING DRILLED ON FLORIDA LEASE DEAL
Sean Paige has discovered that environmental groups are purring like kittens (kittens that ate the canary) after the Bush administration agreed to a $235 million taxpayer buyback of gas and mineral leases on public lands in Florida, where the president's brother, Jeb Bush, just happens to be governor.
     Liberals & Homosexuals Conspire to Subvert Seminaries
Liberals who blame celibacy for the Catholic Church's pedophilia scandals are missing the real cause: seminaries that actively encourage homosexuality, moral laxity, and theological dissent all in the name of post-Vatican II "renewal."  In Goodbye, Good Men, Michael S. Rose demonstrates that such seminaries are by no means rare.  Help defend Christianity from assault by those who would subvert its message from within. Save over 30%!  Order now.  WHATï¿? NOT TO LIKE ABOUT A TREATY THAT WILL ï¿?ND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN?ï¿?
Janice Crouse and Wendy Wright tell us that on the surface, CEDAW looks advantageous to all women. What's not to like about a treaty that would supposedly "end discrimination against women"? If this was what CEDAW really was about, we all would applaud it. But it's not.
IS THE NEA FAIR TO ITS RELIGIOUS MEMBERS?
          BOB CHASE SAYS YES: The record shows that NEA treats all teachers ï¿?
both union and nonunion ï¿?with respect.
Persecution? The form used by the Ohio Education Association to determine whether a religious objector has a legitimate case under the law is less probing, less intrusive and far shorter than the information the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation advises individuals to provide.
          STEFAN GLEASON SAYS NO: The NEA's primary goal is to impose its radical social agenda on public education.
In May, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that the National Education Association systematically discriminates against teachers who have a religious objection to joining or supporting that teachers union. This confirmed once again that the nation's largest teachers union has a bias against people of faith who do not support its radical social agenda.
CONNERLY LEADS THE FIGHT FOR A COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY
Deroy Murdoch asks what color are you? Black? White? Brown? Yellow? None of my concern, you say? If so, why is your ethnicity the government's business?
ROTHMAN WARY OF SHIFT IN CULTURE
In an exclusive interview by Stephen goode, scholar Stanley Rothman says there has been a change in society and a breakdown in the social order that one day will turn around, but he does not know when.

A new issue of Insight on the News is now online
Folks, in case you missed it, John Berlau’s blockbuster on how anti-
tobacco lawyers are now targeting fast food is still posted  And Hans Nichols sweeps the dirt on the Ninth Circuit Court out from under the carpet, and explains how it could have done the unthinkable---rule the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional  I know you’ll enjoy them! OK, until next time, from the Bunker, I’m your newsman in Washington.
ONE NATION, UNDER THE NINTH CIRCUIT
Hans Nichols says they ruled the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional. Read more about this "Rogue Court." SUPPLYING TERRORISTS THE ‘OXYGEN OF PUBLICITY’
Jamie Dettmer opines that combating terrorism is a desperate undertaking for any democratic government. Fight with merely military might and the struggle can be lost — as the Reagan administration belatedly learned in Central America in the 1980s and the Russians have found in Chechnya.
A BURNING ISSUE
Phil Magers writes that Arizona and Colorado burn the wildland fire management debate rages.
     Be Your Own Boss!!
No Selling. . . No Overhead. . . Immediate Cash Flow. . .Start Now
UNLIKE CLINTON, BUSH IS MEETING THE THREAT OF TERRORISM
Ralph Reiland writes that like three blind mice, House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Democratic political strategist James Carville are running around saying they want their eyes opened as to what's going on in this country about terrorism.
SYMPOSIUM---PRO & CON
Q: Has the White House ignored human rights in the name of national security? WILLIAM SCHULZ SAYS: YES: The administration has given itself and its coalition partners a 'pass' on human-rights violations.
ROBERT L. MAGINNIS SAYS: NO: It is not treating suspected terrorists inhumanely nor trampling on the civil rights of citizens.
America's global war on terrorism significantly will advance human rights because it will free people from repression and the threat of terrorism. Until the war is over, however, expect temporary sacrifices for more security. Every soldier facing the enemy understands this unavoidable trade-off.
 BIZARRE RULING—NO REGULATION NEEDED
Sean Paige tells us, in what well could be a first, a leading government agency with responsibility for public safety has recommended against heaping yet another safety mandate on the mountain of regulations already in place to ensure that accidents don't happen.

MAJOR LEAGUES PLAYING BALL WITH CASTRO

CULTUREï¿½THE GOPï¿½S MIDTERM ELECTION EDGE
Chad Stafko writes that the famous color-coded 2000 presidential-election map, with the counties that went to George W. Bush shaded in red and those that went to Al Gore in blue, painted a picture of a divided nation. The red counties will make the state of the culture the deciding issue.
DEPT. OF  ENERGYï¿½S MOTHBALL FLEET OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL CARS
Sean Paige reveals that the Department of Energy has purchased thousands of alternative-fuel vehicles in recent years to appear as if it is at the vanguard of energy-conservation efforts. But the department has made little progress in cutting its overall gasoline consumption.

WHAT HE DIDNï¿½T KNOW AND WHEN HE DIDNï¿½T KNOW IT
Ken Timmerman writes that despite the hue and cry from partisan Democrats and the media, the Bush team did not act irresponsibly before the attacks on New York City and Washington.
CLINTON UNDEAD HAUNTING THE PENTAGON
Michael Waller reports that antimilitary holdovers and entrenched bureaucrats are using Pentagon-funded platforms to undermine national-defense policies of President George W. Bush.

Tim Maier tells us that U.S. Navy pilot Michael Scott Speicher was shot down during the Persian Gulf War and classified as 'killed in action' despite reports that he survived. Did he ultimately die because of Pentagon inaction, or could he still be alive in an Iraqi prison more than a decade later?
