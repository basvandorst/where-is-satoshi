Hi Folks,
There is an interesting article by Simon Garfinkle in this
morning's(Apr 2nd) electronic version of the San Jose Mercury news.
Its on the index page so I don't think you need an account to read
The article deals with the new key management features and extensions
in Viacrypt and how PRZ is upset since it allows employers to read
their employees messages.
The URL is:

I also got one of these right after I posted to cypherpunks.  I
normally just lurk, and the address that was used is the machine I
read and post news on(we have a gateway to the mailing list).  So I am
pretty sure it is related to my posting to cypherpunks.  I have written to the administrators at anon.penet.fi asking about this
and informing them.  I'll pass on any relevant info they send me.

   I'm confused. Instead of you alone getting a copy of every reply, you'd
   prefer the scenario where you get a copy of every reply, and so does    everyone else on the cypherpunks list, because _you_ get too much mail ?
   How does this scheme reduce the amount of email you get ?  Are you not in
   fact subscribed to cypherpunks ?
I suspect that he (like me) reads cypherpunks in News.  Here at
Caltech anyway the mailing list is gated into our NNTP news service.
This is a big improvement over having mailing list stuff in your normal
mail box.
