@_subject: "S1" encryption system (was: this looked like it might be interesting) (fwd) 
Forwarded message:
In high school I was in JROTC and was put in charge of security for our
batallion. I read the army's guides to physical security. These books
were dated early 80's and late 70's, so the situation might have changed, but I doubt it. They denoted three information security clearance levels.
CLASSIFIED, SECRET, and TOP SECRET. If TOP SECRET doesn't exist now, it
definately did just a few years ago.

@_subject: Purple Boxes 
This isn't very important, but there actually is a purple box, but
like many boxes hogging up "colorspace" this one isn't too exciting.
Its a telephone hold button... (woo woo) Does anyone know of sources for des chips???
Are there any public key chips out there???
Has anyone ever tried putting PGP on a chip??? RSA??? (Are these too
slow for realistic real time hardware voice/data encryption??)
I know a little about digital electronics (I am a computer engineering
student) and I would love to get some data books and see if I could
come up with a secure "encryption box" that people could build. Obviously such things are available from AT&T, etc... but they come at
a premium due to the fact that people who need such security normally
have the cash for it. I little public key encryption box that is arguably easy to construct and costs less than $50 in parts would
catch on fast in the hacker world. At that point, someone would go into
business selling the things, as compaines did with blue boxes (remmeber
how apple computers got started?) and red boxes (look in 2600 marketplace.)
Please anyone send me info on possible vendors/databooks and I will definately
look into this.
