@_subject: PGPShell & Eudora 
While trying to solve a corrupted clearsig problem with Eudora 2.2 and
PGPShell, I noticed comments in the c-punks archives on this same problem.
I wanted to pass on that Aegis Research's PGPShell "Beta4" version solves
the problem and does "preprocess" the message before signing so that Eudora
won't wreck it.  The shell can be downloaded at    It is
self-extracting and, if installed in your existing PGPShell directory will
create a subdirectory named "Pretty~1" (no, I am not kidding) and then
install the new .exe there.
