@_subject: CompuRx Research Panel 
Dear Consumer,
CompuRx, Inc., an independent healthcare market research organization, is currently recruiting consumers to join a panel to participate in selected healthcare related market research studies.  These studies are presented in either a traditional paper format or an online web-based format.
Typically, when we are conducting a study that we feel may be of interest to a particular subset of panel members, we will send an email invitation to participate.  The email will include a brief outline of the study specifications.  After reviewing the study information, members may opt to participate or members may decline participation.  Remember, study participation is ALWAYS OPTIONAL and, importantly, declination of any one study does not impact the solicitation of member support for future research efforts.
To enroll in this very important market research panel, please visit:
