Behind Blue Coat: An update from Burma
Citizen Lab research into the use of commercial filtering products in countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes has previously documented the use of devices manufactured by U.S.-based Blue Coat Systems in Syria and Burma. In Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of commercial filtering in Syria and Burma, we identified Blue Coat devices in Burma through the error messages, hostnames and filtering behaviour on Burmese Internet service provider (ISP) Yatanarpon Teleport.
Since the publication of Behind Blue Coat, it has been reported that the U.S. Commerce Department has launched an investigation to determine if the company had prior knowledge that its equipment was being used by the Syrian government.1 This action was launched following a call from three U.S. Senators for an investigation into Blue Coat and NetApp, another U.S. company whose equipment has been implicated in surveillance activities by the Syrian government.2
Additional evidence gathered by the Citizen Lab from Burma since the publication of that report has provided further confirmation that Blue Coatbs devices are presently in use in the country. A message displayed to users by Yatanarpon Teleport references Blue Coat in the URL and is consistent with how Blue Coat devices display notification messages to users. Combined with the evidence presented in Behind Blue Coat, these new findings present a strong case that Blue Coatbs devices are actively in use in Burma.

In Ex-Soviet States, Russian Spy Tech Still Watches You
"Manned by the countrybs main security service, the FSB, this bSystem of Operative Search Measuresb has been in use for more than two decades. But recently, SORM has been upgraded. It is ingesting new types of data. It is being used as Moscowbs main tool for spying on the countrybs political protesters. And it has become extremely useful in the quest to make sure that the Kremlinbs influence in the former Soviet Union continues long into the second regime of Vladimir Putin."

@_subject: [liberationtech] Finfisher Spy Kit Revealed in Bahrain 
For Immediate Release
July 25, 2012 -- The Citizen Lab announces the publication of a detailed post analyzing several pieces of malware targeting Bahraini dissidents, shared with us by Bloomberg News.
The analysis suggests that the malware used is "FinSpy," part of the commercial intrusion kit, Finfisher, distributed by the United Kingdom-based company, Gamma International.
The commercial market for computer network attack, exploitation, and targeted surveillance products and services is growing. Several reports have identified these products and services being marketed to regimes that violate human rights or employ them to quell political opposition. However, the market is shrouded in secrecy with some companies going so far as advertising their clandestine capabilities. The market has been controversial: In September 2011, the EU Parliament passed a resolution that bans the export of information technology systems that can be used bin connection with a violation of human rights, democratic principles or freedom of speech [b&] by using interception technologies and digital data transfer devices for monitoring mobile phones and text messages and targeted surveillance of Internet use.b
While there have been reports and descriptions of Gamma International's products (including revelations that they had been sold to the Egyptian government's state security apparatus), this is the first public analysis of the Finfisher toolkit.
Malware analysis by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Bill Marczak. Assistance from Seth Hardy and Harry Tuttle gratefully received.
Special thanks to John Scott-Railton.
Thanks to Marcia Hofmann and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
We would also like to acknowledge Privacy International for their continued work and graciously provided background information on Gamma International.

Dear Lib Tech
Citizen Lab is publishing a new report this morning, "Backdoors are Forever: Hacking Team and the Targeting of Dissent?" In this report, Citizen Lab Security Researcher Morgan Marquis-Boire describes analysis performed on malicious software used to compromise a high profile dissident residing in the United Arab Emirates. The findings indicate that the software is a commercial surveillance backdoor distributed by an Italian company known as Hacking Team. The report also describes the potential involvement of vulnerabilities sold by the French company, VUPEN.
Our report is here:

Dear LibTech
I am pleased to announce a new Citizen Lab report:
Permission to Spy: An Analysis of Android Malware Targeting Tibetans
April 1, 2013
Key Findings
A compromised version of Kakao Talk, an Android-based mobile messaging client, was sent in a highly-targeted email to a prominent individual in the Tibetan community.
This email message repurposed a legitimate private email message sent by an information security expert in the Tibetan community to a member of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile.
This malware is designed to send a userbs contacts, SMS message history, and cellular network location to attackers.
The cellular network information gathered by this malware would only be useful to actors with detailed knowledge of the cellular communication providerbs technical infrastructure.
The compromised application was not detected as malware by any of the three mobile malware scanning applications we tested.

@_subject: [liberationtech] Why Bluecoat? 
Hi LibTech
Citizen Lab is undertaking research on the commercial market for censorship, surveillance, and computer network attack
capabilities -- hence the interest in Blue Coat, but among many other reports we have done either alone or collaboratively
with others on the topic.  That would include reports going back to the mid 2000s on the use commercial filtering products,
published under the auspices of the ONI, and including reports on Fortinet in Burma, Smart Filter in Iran, Websense in a variety
of MENA / Gulf countries, and more recently Netsweeper.  We have also published several reports on Gamma Group, and
one on Hacking Team.  Additionally, we are working collaboratively with Privacy International and Agentura.Ru on the commercial
surveillance market in Russia and the former Soviet Union.
Our interest is to document what's going on in the first instance, typically employing a mixed methods approach that we are refining -- and a lot of that can be opportunistic depending on the modalities of deployment.  A second, growing concern of ours is around the question
of what can be done about this market.  Specifically on Blue Coat, readers of lib tech might be interested in an oped that Sarah McKune and I wrote that talks
about the issue of shareholder pressure on Blue Coat as one approach short of regulation, after we determined that the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is a majority
owner of Blue Coat systems.  You can read that oped here:
I should mention that we posted questions directly to Blue Coat in our report here:
...and sent a letter directly to Blue Coat systems and the OTPP reiterating those questions.
To date we have not received any reply.
