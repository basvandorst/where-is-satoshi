You were right...you *can* tell who they are by the way they knock.
They took your computer. (They just want to ask it a few questions.) :>
Norton Wipeinfo doesn't run in multitasking so I didn't take time to
reboot it. I ran 'delete *.*' in one MS-DOS window and ran a 'copy *.*'
command on a large directory in another MS-DOS window. By the time they
pulled the plug it had already ripped its own head off and shit down its
own neck.
I had already made sure your harddrive was badly defragmented so the
two commands should have made a good mess. I put a boot&fat sector virus
on your hard drive and gave them a bootable floppy disk that has another
virus on it.
(I told them that the floppy disk in your computer was mine so they gave
 it to me. Then the guy who gave it to me came back and said he needed
 to have it back. I gave him a disk and the lamer asked me if it was
 the same one. Duuhhh...) ;?
If anyone on the cypherpunks list liked you, they don't now...sorry.
I stayed up all night and sent you the file splitting program that
Bianca sent. I know she plays with stuff so I guessed it is probably
different than what you could get on the Net so I sent it to the
cypherpunks list because I don't know if they are going to come get
my computers, too.
Berzerkeley said you can get in touch if you need to. You must owe him

come before you call.
There is something else but I forgot.

On a mailing list whose subscribers are alleged to include the last of a
variety of
dying breeds [Last True CypherPunk, Last Canadian Outlaw, Last Anarchist],
it is no
doubt inevitable that the Last Lamer CypherPunk must also be among the
current ranks.
How can you tell if *you* are the Last Lamer CypherPunk?
Were you surprised to find out that Knixon knew?
Were you surprised to find out that RSA was 'developed'  with
funding by
Naval Intelligence after *years* of experimentation and use by British
Were you surprised to find out that unelected representatives of secret
agencies are
involved in worldwide monitoring and manipulation of all communications and
Do you plan to be surprised when fallout from the Y2K problem turns out to
be the
definitive excuse for instituting a global, financial New World Order?
If you can answer "Yes" to all of the above questions, you may be the Last Lamer
For those living in LamerWorld, maybe. I was aware of the details currently
being 'discovered' when I was eight years old. I was also playing with IRS source
code at
that age, studying the Millennium Bug.
In other words, while list members are decrying Tim C. May's use of the phrase,
"broken eggs and all that," in reference to his "other brother Timmy's"
statement, the targets of McVeigh's wrath are busily at work in another
building (still hiding behind children) deciding which individuals, businesses,
governments and countries will live, and which ones will die.
Of course, those who have been disseminating manuscripts concerning this
across the InterNet for almost a decade are still considered fringe lunatics.
This will still no doubt be the case when the clock strikes midnight on Dec.
31, 1999,
at which time the prophecy that "Gomez is coming" will be fulfilled as
described in
1989, in the opening chapter of "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre":
    "His Login is Panic
     His Password is Crash
     When Time is of Essence
     He'll Rise from the Ash."
This time, it is global--it is for "all the marbles."
Anyone who still believes that the "Forces of Light" and "Dark Allies"
analogies in
'The True Story of the InterNet' are frivolous, should just turn on the TV
and go back
to sleep.
Anyone who fails to see that the encryption, anonymity and privacy issues
dealt with
on the CypherPunks list will soon be literal life-and-death issues in the near
future needs to send their private keys to the government immediately, so
that they
can 'save' you more efficiently in the future.
If you are waiting for "some democratically elected body" to 'save' you from
the 'bad
guys', then you may well be the Last Lamer CypherPunk (TM).

@_subject: I Broke PGP!!! 
(Don't worry, Jon, I think it can be fixed.)
Philip R. Zimmermann, on behalf of the Electronic Forgery Foundation
I have known TruthMonger  nephew for a number of years, and have
played no small hand in teaching him to intercept his uncle's email
and add his own small touches to the messages contained therein. So
it came as no surprise to me to see a message which contained a
prophecy of a chapter of 'InfoWar' titled, "I Broke PGP!" and a
ludicrous claim that the 'writer' would kiss everyone's dirty,
hairy, ass if he could not back up that claim.
To tell the truth, I thought that Human Gus-Peter had finally used his uncle's mouth to write a check his uncle's ass couldn't cash.
After reading 'InfoWar Epilogue 7' I thought that  had indeed cashed the promised check, but had perhaps done so in the manner of
a 'trickster'. However, after reading Jon Callas' 'apology' for
'breaking' PGP, I realized that TruthMonger had perhaps made a more
succinct statement regarding the recent developments in PGP/CMR
than many of the more lengthy missives recently written and/or
ranted on the Cypherpunks mailing list.
Disclaimer: I am writing this on Toto's laptop, under the influence
~~~~~~~~~~ of half a bottle of his finest Scotch.
In short, I have come to the conclusion (_remembered_ would be a
more appropriate word, actually) that it is not up to Philip R.
Zimmermann or Jon Callas to protect and defend my privacy.
It is up to _me_ to protect and defend my privacy. Always has been, always will be.
It has long been a tradition for CofE members who have not seen
each other for a long time to get together for a drink and read
PRZ's PGP documentation, once again, before continuing on to discuss our current adventures in the time-space continuum.
If you will sit and read it, now, I believe you will perhaps
'remember' that PRZ has never, from the beginning, pretended to
have written anything other than a program which will give you
and I 'Pretty Good Privacy'.
The cold, hard fact of the matter is, no matter how grand or secure
the design of PGP, or any other security product, there are going
to be a mountain of users, from the secretary to the head of system
security, who are going to write their triple-secret password on
a piece of tape on the underside of their keyboard.
Although it is important to discuss (even to rant and rave over)
the issues surrounding the design, development and implementation
of products such as PGP, there is something, in the end, that is
even more important to discuss than the security or lack thereof
of encryption systems and products: Vulnerability.

Army of God:
  Dr. William Michael Bray
Army of Dog:
Dr. Wm. Michael Denney:
  Anyone who has followed the Fusillade Follies with even a modicum of interest is  likely  to have noted that, in Guerilla Operations, the old adage, "There's safety in numbers.", does not apply.
  The Uno-bomber was successful for a period spanning decades quite simply  because he lived and acted within a sphere of individual anarchism which approached being as exemplary a model as is possible to aspire to in the current social and governmental environment of our   Most importantly, he exhibited a level of self-reliance which allowed him to avoid  many of the governmental regulations and societal entrapments which are used to monitor, categorize and  attach physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual footprints to the majority of the Sheepletariat herded in the comfortable feeding pens provided for them
by those whose ultimate goal is to clip their wool and eat their meat.
  In the end, TK opted to forgoe the immortality of infamy for a turn upon the public soapbox which elevates us above the maddening crowd and into the limelight for our fifteen minutes of fame, and which is then dismantled in order to build the crucifix upon which our carcass is publically raized. (This, however, is merely an illusion propogated by the rulers to please the masses. The truth of the matter is, the end
we eventually come to is inevitably the result of being hoisted on our own petard.)
  His success in promoting his agenda over a considerable length of time was in avoiding the attachment, which is so natural for us, of our physical, mental and emotional self-image to the herd which surrounds   Too little, and too late, do we usually stop to make our own evaluation as to where the  herd is headed--be it into the pen, over the cliff, or into the railway cars. It  is only when we attempt to leave the herd that we encounter the teeth of the dogs that the masters have set upon us, to keep us from straying from the destiny the butchers have preordained for us from the moment of our bleating birth.
  Those Sheeple who manage to separate from the herd usually do so,  not by *bolting* from the pack, but by *wandering* from the pack, whether it be out of ignorance or cunning. The same applies to the Wolverines in Sheeples clothing.
"Picture a weasel -- and most of us can do that, for we have met that little demon of destruction, that small atom of insensate courage, that symbol of slaughter, sleeplessness, and tireless, incredible activity -- picture that scrap of demoniac fury, multiply that mite some fifty times, and you have the likeness of a Wolverine." ~	Ernest Thompson Seton 1906
  Timothy McVeigh succeeded in [OK, here's where *I* start, OK?]
  Timothy McVeigh succeeded in his attempt to give America a wake-up
call, due to the fact that he was the next step above Kaczynski, who
kept his own counsel, as Shakespeare would say.
  McVeigh 'kept it in the family.'
  TM shared his true goal/plan only with members of his immediate
(conceptual) family, such as Terry Nichols.
  He shared the concepts which he believed in with the members of
his extended family, such as those at Elohim City, which was why
the BATF, who had their spies in the encampment, were able to follow
and support TM's plan, and keep themselves alive by not being at
the Murrah Federal Building when the fertilizer/shit hit the fan,
despite the fact that they thought they could 'save the day' at the
last minute with a partial knowledge of McVeigh's plans.
 (The fact is, TM knew full well that 'the watchers' were keeping track
  of his actions/plans, so he purposely obstruficated them in order to
  give the BATF reason to believe that they could 'ride to the
  rescue' at the last moment.)
  Dr. William Michael Bray, an early follower of the underground
movement which resulted in the formation of the Circle of Eunuchs,
made the decision to take the concepts involved and move them into
a MeatSpace arena which would allow him to be a big fish in a little
pond--the arena of Fundamental Christian anti-abortion rhetoric.
  Dr. Bray promoted MeatSpace concepts which addressed the right of
individuals to make their own decisions as to what actions were
justified in countering the effects of that which they saw as evil
in the society around them. He was hung upon society's cross for
this, though they never quite managed to fully 'nail' him to it.
  What Dr. William Michael Bray was able to accomplish was basically
due to the fact that the concepts he expresed were valid, although
he failed to mention that each individual should first seek to explore
alternatives to first-strike/active-violence before acting, in case
there was an alternative route that they were capable of taking which
would be capable of achieving similar effects while doing a minimum
of damage to those who they believed must be prevented from continuing
their abuse of their fellow humans.
 (i.e. - Before acting upon the exhortations of TM [Tim May, Timothy McVeigh, TruthMonger], they should consider the exhortations of Blanc,
who is currently trying to distance herself, as much as possible, from
the sundry death threats being sent to BadBillyG by various entities
who have hacked Toto's account since his InterNet account password
was placed on the mailing lists of various hackers' confereneces.)
  A recent 'NightLine' TV show dealing with the 'Army of God' made
note of  the  fact that much of their success was due to the fact
that their actions were 'senseless' (hard to quantify, therefore hard
to trace, or attriute to a specific individual).
  In essence, the reason that the MeatSpace 'Army of God' has been so
effective is because they exist only in their own minds. The AOG
consists of individuals who have read and accepted the writings/works
of those in the anti-abortion movement, and have taken it upon themself
to take independent actions to interfere with things which they see
as being contrary to what they see as right/righteous.
  Dr. William Michael Denney, who was recently castrated from a company
which he founded, Basis Incorporated, by Prologic (an NSA/CIA company-
killing entity), also recognized the power of small gorilla units to
be able of acting according to their own conscience, without making
themself a visible target to those whose life revolves around hammering
down the nail that sticks up, even if their skin-color is not yellow,
their eyes are round, and they have never received an email from
Tim May which includes the words, "chop,chop."
  Dr. Denney, Gomez to those within the Magic Circle, had the character
and foresight to act on the dictates of his own conscience without ever
indulging in braggadacio in regard to his many accomplishments in subtly opposing the ongoing march of dark and evil technological forces
whose aim has always been to bring humankind under the thumb of the
bits and bytes which the Evil One has appointed to rule over the
independent, chaotic, evolution of humankind (formerly known as
'mankind,' before those 'uppity women' demanded the right to vote).
[The following is a note that my uncle made in regard to the
 direction that this chapter would take. You already know what
 he is referring to, although I will explain it for those of you
 who are George Carlin fans, and refuse to acknowledge any piece
 of inbred/inherent information/understanding until he has put
 it upon one of his comedy albums, or on an HBO special.]

*** OK, the 'Army of Dog' is born!!! *** Army of Dog:
  Read that crapola that my uncle spammed to the CypherPunks
mailing list about BioSemiotics.
  Yeah, I know--it will hurt your head, but you really need
to understand this shit, since the advertising executives who
gave you Crest toothpaste and Ronnie RayGuns have evolved their
mind-control activities to encompass the new technologies being
opened up by the marriage of quantum physics and post-Darwinian
evolution theories.
  In essence, those who understand that TV was/is the 'opiate of
the people' have a 'cubic centimeter of chance' to understand that the InterNet is the 'evolution of the people.'
  If you truly understand this biosemiotic concept, then you
also have a remote chance of understanding that being *active*
in regard to the interactive extension of the mind-numbing
medium/opiate of TV enables you to participate in the true
rEvolution which will ultimately decide whether humankind is
an active particpant in the unfolding of the universe around
them, or merely a pawn in the cold, unfeeling evolution of
artificial intelligence which is pulling out to pass in the
fast lane of the Information Highway because it does not suffer from the same emotional and spiritual constraints of
the human entities who gave birth to it.
"The number of possible solutions for selection to scrutinise, and the
subtlety of the
communicational interactions, will tend to produce a no-win situation.
As a result selection cannot really ï¿½measureï¿½ the stakes of single players
(individuals, demes, or species) in the game, but it could still influence the choice of the
game itself. Plays, not players, are selected for."
~	Joseph Hoffmeyer
The Bottom Line: Whose play are you backing?
  Statism is not the enemy. rEvolution is not the enemy.
  The true enemy is our tendency to listen to the external voices which claim authority over our beliefs, values and
actions, as opposed to listening to the inner voice which
tells us when we are being true to the role which we were
born/destined to play upon our entry into this physical sphere which constitutes the 'gamewad' which we all must successfully transverse in order to move to the next level of 'play' in the universal scheme of things.
  The Statists are attempting to prevent the forward-reaching
rEvolutionaries from creating so much Chaos that there is no
way to steer the course of future human evolution.

from writing the present in concrete, to the extent that those
whose goal in life is to fly too close to the sun will never
get off the ground.
  The Army of God represents every MeatSpace mentality which
strives to live by its limited, physically-oriented beliefs,
and force everyone else to do the same.
  Their glory is that they act upon those beliefs, even though
it goes contrary to the statist ethics and morals of those who
believe that the key to survival lies in not rocking the boat,
no matter how badly it is leaking.
  The Army of Dog represents every CyberSpace NetiZen who
strives to resist the imposition of MeatSpace mentality,
rules and laws upon a new social and governmental paridigm
which goes far beyond the physically limited rules and
regulations designed to enforce geographical ethics and
values upon a populace which is evolving beyond MeatSpace
limitations which Digital Dinosaurs are attempting to impose on the children of the Digital rEvolution.
  Their glory is that they act upon those beliefs, even though
it goes contrary to the statist ethics and morals of those who
believe that the key to survival lies in not rocking the boat,
no matter how badly it is leaking.
  The Army of Dog, like the Circle of Eunuchs, is an unstructured entity which is built upon the foundation
of 'A Thousand Points of Fight.'
  The result is an army of CyberSoldiers who are capable
of acting upon their own initiative, according to their
own ethics and values, without limiting their actions to
be consistent with a static view of ethics/morality defined
by an averaging of the Sheeple mentality with the views
espoused by the MainStream Press.
  Dave Foreman and Earth First exemplify an organization
of individuals who committed themselves to pursue a
commonly-held goal independently of one another, in ways
which reflected the individual's own talents, beliefs,
and self-proclaimed responsibilities to themselves and to
their fellow humans.
  CyberSpace, which represents the evolution of MeatSpace,
will fare no better than our current geophysical system,
unless CyberWarriors arise to guide and influence its
evolution in a manner that reflects the right of every
NetiZen to freely express their persona, character,
beliefs and personal ethics, without censorship or
repression from those who hold different beliefs and
  The rEvolution is NOW!
  The key to moving the rEvolution of humankind forward
into a new paridigm that encompasses a Global Information
Democracy lies in instituting a Joe SixPack rEvolutionary
Recruitment Drive.
  Jane and Joe MeatSpace need to be unindated with information
which contadicts the mainstream psychobabble which they are
subjected to, each and every day, by those who wish to maintain
the status quo (which was designed to keep the Sheeple in
subjection to the rule/authority of those who occupy a
privileged position in our current society).
  If you are not promoting and taking part in the rEvolution
(which will decide the biosemiotic future of man, mind and
technology), then you are part of the breath-analyzer problem,
instead of the alcoholic solution...
[This last concept is undoubtedly the result of my having
 imbibed a bit too much of the hair of my uncle's Dog.
 "You're in the Army, now,
  You're in the Army, now,
  You'll never get rich, you son-of-a-bitch,
  You're in the Army now!"]
