@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Nash equilibrium on p2p networks 
There's actually plenty of work on incentives to cooperation in P2P  systems that can actually interest you. The keywords to look for in Google Scholar are probably "p2p incentives", "p2p reputation".
The papers about the topic that I like most are: "Incentives build  robustness in BitTorrent" by Bram Cohen (P2PEcon 2003) and "Sybilproof  reputation mechanisms" by Alice Cheng and Eric Friedman (P2PEcon 2005).
I wrote my Ph.D. thesis on incentives to cooperation in P2P, and you might be interested in the Background chapter:  p2p-hackers mailing list
