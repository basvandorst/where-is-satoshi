Anyone have any opinions on the feasibility of regulating the internet?

@_subject: regulating the internet -- clarification 
To clarify:  I'm serious about this question, if for no other reason than I
am editing a paper that basically claims it is impossible to regulate the
internet.  I wish that were true, but I'm not sure I buy it.  Any input is
most appreciated.
