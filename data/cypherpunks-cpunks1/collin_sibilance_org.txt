One additional problem: almost no email providers will accept incoming email from dynamic IP addresses, and, unless you pay your ISP $$$, most people can't get a static IP address.
Someone else already mentioned uptime as an issue.

While this is something that could be possible, it is unlikely to have actually occurred. In reality, there is some security in ensuring that there is only one opportunity for an adversary to compromise communication. If they miss that opportunity, the adversary's game is over.
So, unless either 1) you are already of particular interest to the NSA, or 2) the NSA makes a habit of performing MitM attacks on people who email their public key, this protocol is probably safe for you. Not "256-bit equivalent" (or even "40-bit equivalent") safe, but probably safe.
