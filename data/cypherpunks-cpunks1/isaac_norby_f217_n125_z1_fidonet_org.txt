@_subject: Address query 
Could someone here netmail me the address for Mike Godwin of the EFF?  I
should like to ask him about some issues he brought up here a couple of
months back.
Thank you.

posted via the Post-To: function.  Note indicated additions:

I don't have a sense of humor about this and want an explanation, now.
