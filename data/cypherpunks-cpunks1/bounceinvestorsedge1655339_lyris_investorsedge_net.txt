        Dear Investor
        A top analyst at an equity research firm has initiated
        independent coverage on the Neptune Society and we at Investors
        Edge believe the Neptune story and the company's success is well
        worth a little investigation. Key among the analysts findings
        were:
          A 67 % Increase In Revenues Over The Same Period In The Prior
                                      Year
           A 55 % Increase In Gross Margins Over The Same Period In The
                                   Prior Year
          An $8 Target Price, $9 Takeover Price, And An 'Aggressive Buy'
                                  Recommendation
        The Neptune Society is a solid company with experienced
        management, predictable profits, 'Pre-Need' contracts that have
        an annual compound rate of 32.7% from 1998 to 2000, and a $40
        million trust fund that is expected to exceed $74 million by
        2004.
        The Neptune Society was recently relisted on the OTC BB with the
        trading symbol NTUN and is now seeking to be listed on the NASDAQ
        for higher visibility and broader market exposure.
        Banyan Capital Markets LLC, an equities research firm, has issued
        an in-depth report on the Neptune Society. Highlights of the
        report are listed below followed by Banyan's press release and
        contact information.

                       * * *  H I G H L I G H T S  * * *
             Of The Research Report And Key Investment Considerations
           * The Neptune SocietyÂ® is the only public ?pure play? in the
             cremation segment of the death-care services industry and
             the company benefits from extensive goodwill from its
             reputation and high visibility brand name built during its
             27-year history.
           * The compelling value proposition for cremation is its
             simple, dignified, environmentally friendly and economical
             ($799 to $1,299) alternative to traditional burial service
             ($5,000+). The cremation industry is taking market share
             away from traditional burials, increasing from six  percent
             in 1975 to 24 percent in 1998 (0.55 MM cremations) and
             projected to reach 38.2 percent by 2010 (1.0 MM cremations).
             The $15 billion annual death care services industry is
             highly fragmented with the top six companies having a 25%
             market share and numerous acquisition opportunities
             available.
           * The Neptune Society serves customers in 35 major metro areas
             with 16 offices located in 6 states (CA, FL, WA, OR, NY and
             IA), excluding the corporate offices and a dedicated ?call
             center? with 20 telemarketers in Tempe, AZ. One part of the
             company's business model includes opening offices in new
             locations (that meet stringent growth criteria) and making
             selective acquisitions.
           * The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled since
             1999, has substantial industry expertise. The management has
             implemented a multi-pronged marketing strategy focused on
             selling ?Pre-Need? cremation plans. Including direct sales
             over their Web site, the strategy also includes direct mail
             of approximately six million pieces being sent in 2001 and
             the support of five sales managers with approximately 200
             independent, commission- only sales representatives
             providing follow-up.

         BANYAN CAPITAL INITIATES COVERAGE ON THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY WITH AN
                       $8 TARGET PRICE, $9 TAKEOVER PRICE
                         AND AN ?AGGRESSIVE BUY? RATING
          -Top Analyst Reports On Strong Brand Name, Effective Marketing
                         And Growth In Cremation Demand-
        Deerfield Beach, FL, July 10, 2001 ? Banyan Capital Markets, LLC
        announced today that it has initiated coverage of The Neptune
        SocietyÂ®, (OTC BB: NTUN), with a 12-month, $8.00 per share target
        price, a $9.00 per share takeover price, and an ?Aggressive Buy?
        rating.
        ?The Neptune Society is the only ?pure play? public company
        focused solely on the cremation segment of the death care
        services industry,? said Louis M. Fischler, CFA, and VP of
        Investment Banking And Research at Banyan. ?We feel that The
        Neptune SocietyÂ® name has tremendous brand equity due to its
        industry leadership over its 27-year history.
        ?Also, Neptune?s fiscal first quarter results showed strong
        revenue growth and a significant improvement in operating cash
        flow, net of non-recurring and non-cash expenses, versus last
        year?s first quarter. The Neptune Society has developed a
        highly-effective, multi-pronged marketing program for selling
        ?Pre-Need? cremation contracts that consists of direct mail
        campaigns, telemarketing (using its own call center), direct
        sales by independent contractors, and a new Web site.?
        The $15 billion death care services industry is highly fragmented
        with the top six companies holding only a 25 percent market
        share. Traditional burials, which actually declined in the first
        quarter of 2001, are losing market to cremations. The Cremation
        Association of North America estimates the market share for
        cremation will increase from approximately 26 percent to over 36
        percent in 2010, or approximately 1 million cremations per year.
        ?This growth can be attributed, in large part, to the average
        cost of a cremation only being 15 to 25 percent of the average
        cost of a traditional burial, as well as to greater acceptance by
        the general public based upon religious, environmental and other
        considerations,? said Mr. Fischler. According to the report, The
        Neptune Society achieved a 67 percent increase in revenues in
        Q1-2001 versus Q1-2000. As a percentage of revenue, the company
        also increased its gross profit margin by 55 percent and improved
        its EBITDA by $742,000.

                            Neptune Society Highlights
                       *** Key Investment Considerations ***
        The Neptune SocietyÂ® is the only public ?pure play? in the
        cremation segment of the death-care services industry and the
        company benefits from extensive goodwill from its reputation and
        high visibility brand name built during its 27-year history.
        The Neptune Society recently received an 'Aggressive Buy'
        recommendation from Banyan Capital Markets with an $8 target
        price.
        The compelling value proposition for cremation is its simple,
        dignified, environmentally friendly and economical ($799 to
        $1,299) compared to ($5,000+) for a traditional burial service .
        Cremation service revenues were $2,242,000 for the three months
        that ended March 31, 2001 compared to $1,328,000 in 2000, nearly
        double the same period last year.
        The Neptune Society provided 6,639 cremations in 2000 and has
        already provided 5,098 in the first five months of 2001, that is
        double the same period last year with a very conservative
        projected total for 2001 to be approximately 7,400.
        The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled since 1999,
        has substantial industry expertise. The management has
        implemented a multi-pronged marketing strategy focused on selling
        ?preened? cremation plans. Including direct sales over their Web
        site, the strategy also includes direct mail of approximately six
        million pieces being sent in 2001 and the support of five sales
        managers with approximately 200 independent, commission-only
        sales representatives providing follow-up.
        The Neptune Society serves customers in 35 major metro areas with
        16 offices located in 6 states (CA, FL, WA, OR, NY and IA),
        excluding the corporate offices and a dedicated ?call center?
        with 20 telemarketers in Tempe, AZ.

              Neptune Society Leads As Death-Care Stocks Buck Market
                                      Trend
             DANA POINT, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- In recent
             weeks, one of the market's most progressive sectors has
             been the death-care industry with national mortuary
             chains such as Service Corp International, Carriage
             Services and Stewart Enterprises, Inc. having risen to
             within a few points of their 52-week highs.
             However, it's The Neptune Society  (OTC Bulletin Board:
             NTUN),  the nation's only cremation specialist and the
             only death-care provider with a brand name familiar to
             consumers nationwide that seems to be at the forefront
             of the latest move, allowing it to buck today's
             downdrafts in both the Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq
             Composite averages.  Neptune's price resiliency and
             strong volume have been attributed by some observers to
             The Stewart Report, a West Coast research letter that
             initiated coverage on the stock this week.  Moreover,
             Stewart believes expanding awareness of Neptune's
             intention to list on a senior exchange will carry the
             stock higher still.
             The Stewart Report's analysis of The Neptune Society
             highlights its niche opportunity in the marketing of
             pre-need cremation services, payments for which have
             generated a rapidly growing company trust fund that
             presently totals more than $40 million. Analyst J.
             David Stewart says the trust fund which has already
             endowed the Neptune network with a 13-year backlog of
             business in the midst of its best operating year ever,
             will likely grow to $99 million by year-end 2005.
             Stewart also sees a string of steadily improving
             operational years, thanks to a diverse set of
             socio-economic factors presently coming into play.
             These include the aging baby boomer population, the
             expanding geographical range of American families, new
             consumer attitudes towards land usage as it relates to
             traditional casket funerals, and an increasing cost
             consciousness in death-care planning.

             About The Neptune Society
             Headquartered in Burbank, CA., The Neptune Society Inc.
             is one of North America's largest cremation
             specialists, and is the only publicly traded company
             dealing solely in cremation services. The Neptune
             Society, operating for nearly three decades with
             locations in California, Florida, New York, Washington,
             Iowa, Oregon and Arizona has provided thousands of
             cremation services and currently has close to 60,000
             active contracts and nearly $40 million in trust in its
             unique Pre-Need program. The Neptune Society's goal is
             to provide a simple, dignified and economic alternative
             to the traditional funeral burial service system.
                                                   --------------------------------------------------------

                         Highlights Of The Stewart Report
                       *** Key Investment Considerations ***
             The Neptune SocietyÂ® is positioned for the market
             maturation of the "Baby Boomers" and the "Graying of
             America."
             A compelling value proposition for cremation is its
             simple; the average funeral runs from $10-15,000 and
             the average cremation runs $1-3,000. That's a $9-12,000
             spread.
             The $15 billion death-care industry has recently
             survived a five-year shake-out by attrition,
             acquisition, or merger that has left the U.S. with only
             four publicly traded chains and 22,000 independent
             mortuary operators. The Neptune Society is the only
             public "pure play" in the cremation segment of the
             death-care services industry and the company benefits
             from extensive goodwill from its reputation and high
             visibility brand name built during its 27-year
             history.
             The Neptune Society received a 'Strong Buy'
             recommendation from J. David Stewart of The Stewart
             Report with the stock under $8 and a 6-12 month target
             price of $17.50.
             The Neptune Society has 18 locations in 7 states with
             strategic growth initiatives to add to those numbers in
             2001 as they expand to meet demographic concentrations.
             The company also has a dedicated "call center" with 20
             telemarketers in Tempe, AZ.
             The Neptune Trust Fund to facilitate 60,000 'Pre-Need'
             contracts sold and not fulfilled  approximately $40
             million strong. It is estimated the Trust will reach
             $99 million by 2005.
             "The Neptune Society offers the industry's best price
             leverage due to its petite market cap of less than $50
             million."
             To date, 2001 is breaking all company records with
             estimated gross sales for the year at $18 million, new
             'Pre-Need' contract sales estimated at 10,000, and
             'At-Need' sales and administrative fees coming from an
             estimated 7,000 fulfillments.
             --------------------------------------------------------
                                 Recent Events
                             Of The Neptune Society
             Cremation service revenues were $2,242,000 for the
             three months that ended March 31, 2001 compared to
             $1,328,000 in 2000, nearly double the same period last
             year.
             The Neptune Society provided 6,639 cremations in 2000
             and has already provided 5,098 in the first five months
             of 2001, that is double the same period last year with
             a very conservative projected total for 2001 to be
             approximately 7,400.
             The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled
             since 1999, has substantial industry expertise. The
             management has implemented a multi-pronged marketing
             strategy focused on selling "Pre-Need" cremation plans.
             Including direct sales over their Web site, the
             strategy also includes direct mail of approximately six
             million pieces being sent in 2001 and the support of
             five sales managers with approximately 200 independent,
             commission-only sales representatives providing
             follow-up.
             The Neptune Society recently received an 'Aggressive
             Buy' recommendation from Banyan Capital Markets with a
             target price of $8.00.
             The company has a guaranteed 13-year business backlog.
             Due to the nature of the company's business, it is
             virtually recession-proof.

                              HOT OFF THE PRESS !!!
        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
        Burbank, CA., June 27, 2001 Â The Neptune Society, Inc., (OTC BB:
        NTUN) one of the countryÂs largest publicly traded cremation
        specialists, announced its significant strategic accomplishments
        and financial results of operations during the three months ended
        March 31, 2001.
        On June 1, 2001, the staff of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission (SEC) came to a position of no further comment with
        respect to Neptune SocietyÂs Registration Statement Form 10 filed
        with the SEC to register its common stock under the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, completing an extensive and
        expensive 18-month process.  During the process, with guidance
        from the staff of the SEC, Neptune Society developed its
        accounting policies related to recognition of pre-need
        merchandise revenue prior to the provision of cremation
        services.  Subsequently, Neptune Society implemented changes to
        its pre need sales programs that will allow it to recognize
        pre-need merchandise revenues at the point-of-sale in certain
        states on a going forward basis.
        Also with guidance from the staff of the SEC, Neptune Society
        adopted new accounting policies, which resulted in the deferral
        of pre-need merchandise revenues in the amounts of $1.6 million
        and $4.3 million during the first quarter and the year ended
        December 31, 2000, respectively.  Under United States generally
        accepted accounting principles, these deferrals are not
        recognized in the revenues of Neptune Society.  During the first
        quarter ended March 31, 2001, Neptune Society recognized revenues
        of $2.7 million.
        Approximately two and one half years ago, Neptune Society
        acquired a group of closely-held corporations and limited
        partnerships loosely connected with virtually no standardized
        policies and procedures for financial and managerial information
        reporting.  In 2000, Neptune Society invested heavily to
        substantially retool these operations for the purposes of
        realizing operating efficiencies.  Neptune Society has attracted
        talented management personnel, expanded its telemarketing
        operations, updated and expanded its accounting and management
        information systems (including networking office locations
        together), made two strategic acquisitions, opened two new
        offices and implemented the infrastructure and quality controls
        necessary to support future growth and expansion.
        In the first quarter of 2001, Neptune Society began to realize
        positive results from the changes to its business infrastructure
        and the addition of new offices.  Neptune SocietyÂs first quarter
        operations generated positive cash flows, after taking into
        consideration certain prepaid expenses and certain payments
        related to fiscal year 2000, which caused cash flows related to
        operating activities to decrease.  In addition, Neptune Society
        incurred $176,000 in professional fees, primarily related to the
        registration of its common stock under the Securities Exchange
        Act to qualify its shares for listing on the NASD
        over-the-counter bulletin board and, in the future, a listing on
        a major exchange.  The costs incurred for professional fees are
        anticipated to begin to trend downward toward the end of the
        second quarter.
        Management believes that other indicators of growth and progress
        of Neptune SocietyÂs performance include transaction volume and
        non-refundable sales (sales for which the customer has no refund
        or cancellation rights even though these sales may not be
        recognizable as revenue under the new accounting policies and US
        GAAP).  Below are selected financial and operational results for
        the quarter ended March 31, 2001 compared to the same period in
        the prior year:
        Pre-need contract sales volume up                 76%
        Total transaction volume up                            58%
        Revenues up
        68%
        Non-refundable sales (non-US GAAP) up      67%
        Gross profit  up
        100%
        Gross profit % up                                            17%
        Earnings & deferred earnings before interest,
          taxes, depreciation and amortization (non-US GAAP) up $796,099
        While other major death-care industry companies reported
        declining transaction volumes and top line revenues during the
        first quarter compared to the same period in 2000 due in part to
        declining mortality rates, Neptune Society experienced increased
        transaction volume across all product lines.  Pre-need contract
        sales volume increased 76 percent overall, with existing offices
        accounting for 41 percent of the overall increase.  At-need case
        volume increased 46 percent over the same period last year, with
        existing offices accounting for 13 percent of the overall growth.
        Revenues were $2.7 million for the for the three month period
        ended March 31, 2001 compared to $1.6 million for the same period
        in 2000.  Non-refundable sales were $4.2 million for the three
        month period ended March 31, 2001 compared to $2.5 million for
        the same period in 2000.  Non-refundable sales increased 67
        percent due to increased at-need and pre-need activity, change in
        product mix (from installment sales to paid-in-full sales) and
        the introduction of a new travel assurance product offering. The
        introduction of the Neptune Society Worldwide Travel Assurance
        Plan, a new product offering, contributed $295,000 to the
        increase in non-refundable sales and revenues during the first
        quarter of 2001.
        Gross profits doubled from $.65 million for the first quarter of
        2000 to $1.3 million during  for the same period in 2001.  Gross
        profit percentage increased 17 percent due to the increased
        volume of activity and the resulting revenues, which covered
        certain fixed costs related to cremation and telemarketing
        operations.
        Earnings and deferred earnings (deferred revenues and costs, net)
        before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are
        representative of the CompanyÂs operating performance if no
        revenues or costs had been deferred.  This non-US GAAP metric was
        $387,000, up $796,099 in the first quarter of 2001 versus the
        same period in 2000.
        Management believes that the Neptune Society is well positioned
        for growth in each of its core product lines:  Pre-Need contract
        sales and at-need case deposition.  Neptune Society has
        consolidated a group of companies into a strategically focused
        public company serving the cremation segment of the death care
        industry.  Neptune SocietyÂs goal in 2001 is to continue to
        integrate its product offerings, achieve higher organic and
        expansion growth, maintain positive cash flows and maximize the
        value that management believes to be inherent in Neptune Society
        for the benefit of its shareholders.
