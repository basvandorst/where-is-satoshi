@_subject: NSA offering 'billions' for Skype eavesdrop solution 
I thought that the current running theory is that Skype is an NSA operation due to all the spooky crypto being used that seems to have come from nowhere.
Assuming that is true, this recent "leak" would just be their attempt to convince more people (aka criminals) to use their service.
