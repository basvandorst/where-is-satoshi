@_subject: PGP 2.6.2 signator replacement bug fix 
Here's a fix for a minor bug in PGP 2.6.2.  I reported it to pgp-bugs last
February and they responded promptly, but it hasn't been propagated to the
release - I suppose 2.6.2 is "in the freezer".
Anyway, the bug can cause a crash and other folks might like to put in the
fix, so here it is.  Anyone have any others?
