Good letter, But...... I keep a current list of fax numbers for
both house and senate in Arizona on my fax program, I think, don't
you that most cypherpunks should (or do). I ran your letter thru
my word processor and added or colleagues to the attended meatings
line and then faxed to all AZ senate and house members. Maybe it
would be a good Idea to make up a letter that went into deapth on
this clipper proposition and send it out. I myself would post in
arizona and I think others in other states would post too this way
we could reach all of the house and senate. I know from common
sense that real long letters would not work ( < 1 page) and also
that the prime point like "please oppose the clipper legeslation)
should be in very visible print. I sent mine in 20 pica bold
underline. Let me know what you think and glad to be of help even
though I am new to this list and probly would be deemed clueless,
but I due wear nomex underwear..... :{)

It makes more sense to spend the money on xeroxing flyers explaining to people what encryption is, why it's important and how they can get the tools for themselves.  Very people are going to load up a program from a disk that some stranger gave them.  You'll also likely get thrown out of Javitts.
I think that uploading to a local BBS is a bueno idea. I
downloaded all PGP and shell programs from Internet and then
uploaded them to a local BBS. I then put a classified add in the
local Mensa paper (monthly) and gave phone number, description and
asked that if anyone downloaded the files to upload a copy to
their favorite BBS. In Haydukes book "Get Even" they called this
the multiplier effect. Although the add costs me nothing and they
circulation is only around 900 or so issues there is a good chance
the software will travel to another 25 or so boards. I am also
condidering taking out an add in the Arizona Republic (circulation
aloat) and offering PGP  !!!!FREE!!!! to anyone that calls my
friends BBS. That should make him happy and should also spread the
program to thousands of non Internet users. The cost to me is
about $25 but the satisfaction is imense. Hayduke is right about
the multiplier effect, just like I said about faxes earlier. If all
members of this group fax to their non-long-distance government
representatives then we can get the word out effectivly stronger
than any other group. The ol' multiplier effect on the good ol'

@_subject: A distribution solution! 
PGP distribution to the masses.
To preface this message first I would like to state that the clue full people
here on the Internet forget that the rest of the world is truely clue less.
Of course they also may consider you as the clueless ones.
It is often stated that PGP is available on numerous Internet FTP sites and
many BBS's. The average person knows as much about FTP sites as they hear
on the evening news about the information superhighway. They may  keep
financial books or maybe write books on their computer but they do not have
substantial online experiance and they may have a need for secure data
encryption or secure way to send data to a publisher, business partner etc.
Disk mailers are still sold rather widely. The average person trying to download PGP from their local BBS has a few steps to go thru. These clueless
computer users once again may be unfamiliar with the intricacies of online
BBS use but does not mean that they  should not be allowed to access
a good crypto program. First they must find a bbs number localy to call. Then
they must wait X number of hours before the phone is not busy to connect. Once
online they have to register and do a call back verification and then they
can access the file area where PGP should be only to find it is not on this
board. So they download a list of BBS's in their area and start going thru
the same call, verify, is it there loop. This may be an endless loop in some
areas. Anyway this is a mute point as the clueless average user has never heard of RSA or public keys or PGP.
Should criminals have PGP or other crypto software? Should distribution be
regulated to only law abiding citizens? Should guns be registered, or should
gun owners be registered. The average low level drug dealer uses both the
common plastic baggie and the digital pagger. Maybe the government should
regulate the sale of baggies at supermarkets, after all you have to have a
container to put drugs in to sell them ("hold your hand out I'll drop an
oz. of coke in it"). Then again there could be a five day waiting period on
pager and celular phones sales and instalation. This would definatly solve
many problems with those pesky drug dealers. Of course there is always cars
that could be regulated. They are contributory to many crimes and deaths.
How would you make sure the person you are selling your used car to will
never drive while intoxicated or break any speeding laws. You can not.
What's the point here? Well if there is a mandated crypto standard then every
zip on internet of PGP or other crypto software could disapear overnight, just deleted by the system admin under penalty of law. There would still be copies on local BBS's but as we have discovered the average computer user does not access these. How could people change this I wonder?
People talk about handing PGP or other crypto software out but there is a
substantial cost to the return of each disk. 1 disk=one user. In my opinion
the easy way to do it would be this:
1) Find someone with a free use BBS that would like more traffic on his BBS.
2) Upload the files for PGP and other crypto software on their system in
   maybe a special file area.
3) Take out an add in the Sunday paper (maybe get the BBS owner to pay
   half of the cost)that reads as follows;
        "!!!FREE!!! Unbreakable data encryption software.               8N1 file area is CRYPTO !!!Absolutely FREE!!!"
They now know where and how to precisely find the stuff and what it does.
Now the average person has access to the software and use of the software
in a rather large scale. If you had a choice to encrypt your data for free
or pay to add some chip that is not secure. If you take the secure factor
out of the equation then all that is left is the fact that one is free and
the other costs good hard earned cash. I don't know about you, but I learned
rather young that "If it is free, get two of em!".
Thanks for your time!  :{)}

This may be true, but the average computer user does not use
Internet, know what an FTP is, know what a BOT is or know that PGP
is even Available. For that mater they do not usualy use BBS's.
For the use to spread they must be made aware by mediums that they
are familiar with, namely the newspaper and then word of mouth.
Nothing high tech there.

I see nobody mentioned the infringment of the second amendment by

falls. Gee, what article of the constitution protects the right to
cryptography? What are you going to do when they take it away from
you. Probly nothing. The avereage person is definatly not as cool
about cryptoghraphy as you are. But then again they probly are not
as clickish as you are. You and your FTP site on Internet. Wow
everyone knows about that. If they can not figure it out fuck em'.
They are a "NEWBIE". You my friend are the ASSHOlE. To distribute
to the masses is strenghth, not hiding behind some discussion of
tackey dollars. Personly I think YOU are too stupid (OHHH I can
program a computer) and lack the social skills to distribute
crypto software to the masses. Any law probly would have a
grandfather clause. Oh you say your grandfather died three years
ago and you are working on revision X.YYY.Z of your latest
greatest crypto software to worry about distribution. YOU PEOPLE
ARE FOOLS AND HAVE TO MUCH SELF IMPORTANCE IN YOUR SMALL LITTLE
HEADS, NOTHING EXISTS OF OF INTERNET! WRONG THE REAL WORLD DOES!!!
BY NOT DISTRIBUTING TO THE MASSES YOU WILL LOSE (oh you can ftp to

AWAY, THEY WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR FIRST AMMENDMENT RIGHTS. (and it

clipper, so they can't read/see/hear/smell/touch it.  What do you people I thinkl as long as it doesn't have bayonet lugs or an attachment
to launch grenades then you are OK. NOT, if they mandate a form of
crypto as voluntary, they will with in a few years make it
mandatory. Then you will be breaking the law and rocks at the
federal prison. Distribute crypto to the masses (You remember? THE

Health insurance reform
1) Dissallow preexisting clauses and limits in medical policies
2) Pool no hope cases (AIDS, Cancer etc.) in underwriter pool
covered by all insurance companies. 3) Shit? no more medical insurance problems.
4) Oh yea, set maximum rates and make them uniform for all
5) Use public assistance for the remainder of people that fall in

Wow, FUCKIN' hard to figure out. The little round things you have
in your pocket are called coins. If you pick up a phone an ask the
operator to call Fort Yukon alaska she will ask you to put some of
those round things in the phone. Believe it or not, she will now
when the phone has a nuff round things and let your call go thru
for three minutes maybe. Be sure to wipe your fingure prints of
the round things before depositing them in the phone (This is like
doing a file wipe in PGP)

Nixon took us of the gold standard in '73. People go to Economics
school for 6 years just to get paid $ 60k a year to be wrong with
their economic conclussions. By the way in the state of Arizona
there is still a law on the books that allow someone completing a
full stay in prison to recieve a good horse, $20 gold piece,
pistol, rifle and a sadle when released from prison. That is why
the state kicks you out one day early, even on a day for day

It wouldn't be that hard to get rid of lots of it, as long as they
made exceptions to let the big corporate customers stay happy (e.g. banks).
The key would be using the civil forfeiture abuse to let them confiscate
computers that *appear* to be using illegal crypto; you can hire a lawyer
to help you get your box back if they suspect it's got UnAmerican Software.
Your goverment crypto license  will let you use Clipper if you obey the rules;
just think of it as your driver's license on the information superhighway....
The Feds could enforce the 55mph speed limits better if they used confiscation as well.
1) Any Illegal crypto programs could be removed from Internet in a
matter of hours.
2) Any Illegal crypto message sent via Internet could be analyzed
as illegal and not delivered.
3) Anybody sending such messages would face fines or jail senteces.
4) Any government branch that took your computer could keep it for
no reason (except we are investigating it) for a long time,
practicly until your trail and then maybe forfit it.
5) Users of Illegal crypto could be subject to other legal
survailance. (telephone, movements, dosscia etc.)
6) In this state even if Illegal crypto was not a Felony you would
probly receive probation on first offense, 6 months in county jail
on second offense and 1 year on third and subsequent offenses. I
have done 11 months in county jail and found it racialy enlightning

@_subject: Regarding Mr. Nalbandian's Comments (fwd) 
[1] If Joe ComputerUser does not know how to use his computer for more
than word processing and playing games, at this point, he probably doesn't
NEED PGP. If he knows enough to realize what little privacy he actually
has, he will go looking for security. With luck, he will run into someone
who can steer him towards PGP...
Wow, word processer, so i guess that if you are just using a word
processer that you don't need PGP? As usual you distance yourself
from computer users by placing youself on a pedistal above them.
Why is that? Do you feel superior to them? Is it something that
was lacking in your childhood? I bet you could code 500 lines a day
when you were in grade school. I bet you never have just used a
word processer or played games on a computer? Have you? With luck
somebody will give me the winning numbers to the lottery next
week, too. And with wings pigs can fly.
[2] The purpose of this list is not to insure that everyone has a copy and
knows how to use PGP (though most of us would consider that a worthwhile
goal). As it has been said more and more often, 'Cypherpunks write CODE!'.
This is a discussion group about the practicality and implementation of
specific forms of cryptography and cryptographic applications (digital
money, key servers, etc). [ This is not to belittle the political
content of the group, though. ] Groups like the EFF are interested in
helping new users to the Internet learn all about it, and are doing a good
job of it so far. If you are that concerned about the masses not knowing about
cryptography, try sending a note to the EFF (with the caps lock OFF!) and
ask them to include a section on privacy, cryptography and PGP in the next
version of the Big Dummy's Guide To The Internet. It's a start.
Why should I waste my time? You waste your time by writing crypto
that WILL be outlawed and take no action to distribute. And as
usual people on here can't see farther than Internet. They really
can'nt. Must be a pedistal thing. Why write crypto or even purport
it's use if you are to deprive the real people that could aid your
cause the use use of "PGP" or other sutible non-CLIPPER
cryptography. More people are off Internet than on.? [3] Sending badly composed rants to seven hundred people and then
publically posting a response to a private message is not the way to be
taken seriously.
I thought there was only a couple hundred on this list? cool 700! I
have no idea what you mean by public post of private message?

orders on international email. right-on ban crypto. of course the
way this group is going nobody outside of the internet clique will
ever get there hands on pgp or other crypto software. i tried to
find pgp on local bbs's in phoenix and had to call 8 of them before i
found 1 downloadable zip. the average users do not even know it is
available. thru ignorance of the bulk of the populace you will fail
in your crypto efforts. that is a shame too. you, and your group may
know all there is about crypto and may write the best crypto programs
ever written. butttttttttt......... without everyday clueless
non-internet/ftp/pgp familiar users, crypto is pointless. the power
is in distribution. and distribution breeds familiarity and
contempt for the governments brand of escrowed key system. given
the choice of one item in a resturant you only eat what is served
to you. with multiple items you choose the best. face it, if crypto
is outlawed it is too easy to clean out the net so to speak. if
nothing is agressivly distributed then the people will not have
it. if the people do not have it why waste your time writing it. if
it is made illegal you will be an outlaw. if you have distributed
in major cities before hand then at least the public has and will
have access.           * Spelling errors are intentional and international *

Look, just forget the rest of the bullshit and go away and come
back when you've got good working compression at about 12kbits/sec,
so that you can run it down a v32bis over slip or ppp.  All the
rest of the stuff has been written already (nevot, vat etc)
When you've done that we'll start taking you seriously.
PS Oh yes, I foprgot: it has to be done on something less beefy than a
high-speed sparc... any idiot can do that with off the shelf code already.

On CNN there was a poll shown in a short segment about Internet.
The question was "Do you know what Internet (AKA superhighway) is?"
32% had read or heard about Internet
68% had never read about or heard of Internet
It is unclear whether these people are computer users or whether
if they were whether they would use cryptography. One thing that
is certain is they will probly not "FTP" anywhere to get any form
of program.      !!!FREE!!! get it !!!FREE!!! before it is gone!

Well it seems like you people are really as stupid as it seems.
Anybody (That is the dumb fucks name) decided to mail me twenty or
so messages thru a remailer to try and clog my slow timeshare
environment mail reader. Also someone named Ryn R. Snyder (This guy
is extra autistic) did the same thing. Too bad I read all my mail
offline by UUCP on an old slow IBM PS/2 MOD80 (intresting though,
local supermarkets use this model computer as a product code
server). Would not it be funny if someone set there .forward command in
there little used Internet timeshare terminal environment to the
cypherpunks mailing list and then subsribed to the list.
I guess most people missed the point about distribution but that's
OK, CLIPPER is a much better crypto program anyway. People that
are not members of the Internt clique are expossed to it almost
nightly on the news wheras they are not exposed to PGP or other
RSA type crypto. I think marketing whizzes call this product
recognition (don't ask me I am just a dumm as dirt sod buster).
Oh well, I must go now, I now you all respect and adore me as much
as I do you. Also it seems that the few fools that send repeated
stupid mail to my box are in the minority. Thanks for the excelent
and way cool mail that the rest of you send.
32% had heard or read about Internet (AKA Superhighway)
68% had NEVER heard or read of Internet
I quess that 68% can FTP to a site to get PGP (etc.). Out of that
agregate I wonder what percent has heard of PGP or RSA? CLIPPER?

I am sorry to have bothered the group known as cyberpunks.
Please forgive me, but I must go.
There is a TV program about guns in America, I must watch this so I
may have a good laff.
They say you can buy a gun on the street anywhere. I doubt if I
could here near Arizona State University (rated  party school by
playboy magazine). But if an econimist would look at graphs for
public assistance from the Fed and comparied it with crime rate
per 1,000 citizens in an area he probly could find an area to
purchase guns rather rapidly (he probly would not need to look at
the crime figures, just public assistance).
Freenzy like a shark. The newspapers do a survey to see what
people are concerned about. They are concerned about crime. So they
write articles about crime. People get more concerned about crime.
So they write more articles 8 (that is supose to be sideways)
Intresting to note, no one brags about the statistics involving
police officers and violent gun related crime. Could it be that
having a hand gun strapped to your belt deters crime? Or is it
just the bullet proof vest. I know this is stupid second amendment
talk, but it is only one away from cryptographies 1st amendment
and 3 away from the 5th that should allow you to have any crypto
your heart desires. After they strike down the right to protect
your documents on your word processer, what next, torture for
confessions? Well one thing for sure you probly won't have a gun
to defend your freedom of speech or your freedom to assemble or any
other freedom you can think of that can be taken away in the
proclamation of national intrest. Sorry for bothering you.
