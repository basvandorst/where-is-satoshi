@_subject: Elliptic Curve Y**2 = x**3 + a * x**2 + b 
Hello all,
I have a math question concerning implementation of elliptic
curve systems. In coding some elliptic curve source, I
need to pick a random point on the following elliptic
curve in field F_p where p is a prime number.
       Y**2 = x**3 + a * x**2 + b
       where 4a**3 + 27b**2 is not equal to 0 mod p
In selecting a random point, I pick a random value for
x in the range 0 < x < p, compute the right hand side
of the equation and find myself needing to take the
square root for the two solutions.
Questions are:
  1: How can I take the suqare root mod p ?
  2: How to determine if a solution exists for a
     selected value of x ?
  3: Is the a simpler method than find a square root ?
Thanks for any ideas you may have about this...

A security issue is selecting an elliptic curve whose order (number
of points on the elliptic curve) is divisible by a large prime number.
I still have to implement this selection process and thus will have
my a and b selections driven by this analysis.
There also could be some bandwidth savings when transmitting an
elliptic curve point to transmitt just the x and the sign bit of y
and let the receiver reconstruct the actual y value.
The choice for prime p could have overall speed benefits by selecting
a p=3 mod 4 that makes the math simpler. This was also in Wei Dai's
ModularSquareRoot C++ code "if(p%4 == 3) return a_exp_b_mod_c(a, (p+1)/4, p);"

Anyone have a FPGA chip PCI board layout that they would like to
share. Having seen the paper "Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric
Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security", the FPGA chip
seems like a perfect addition to my pc. Count me in...
