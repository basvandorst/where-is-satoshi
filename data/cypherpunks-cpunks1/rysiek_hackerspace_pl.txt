Thing is, this encryption scheme (in which, from what I read, Google has access to "master keys" and has the technical ability to decrypt data once it's subpoenad) brings no additional safety to users. It sounds great ("we support encryption! and we're doing it with several keys! that has to be safe, eh?"), but it does effectively nothing to actually protect users and their data from PRISM and similar programmes.
And that means it will be this harder for us to explain why this is a bad scheme ("wait, you're saying encryption is evil? now I am confused!") and why people should use other methods of protecting their privacy and their data.

Instead, what we get is "please, dear users, play according to rules set by this behemoth that can do with e-mail whatever the hell it wants". Hence my (overly ribald for some, as it turns out) metaphor.

Same here.
Well, my bad. Should have been more clear there, I give you that.
I do attribute malice to Google with regard to several of their recent actions (the Jabber debacle and the anti Net Neutrality stance, for starters). With great power (and Google does have great power over the Internet right now, sadly) comes great responsibility; they *should* be aware of what effect their policies have on the rest of the Net.
And I would say, we should *expect* them to be aware of that. Even more -- I am quite sure they *are* aware. And hence, we're getting dangerously close to what could be described as malice: conscious decision to perform actions that are heavily detrimental to a lot of other entities with the only rationale being profit maximalisation.
I shall re-phrase, then:
"We are being fucked in the arse by GMail, so let's ask them politely to use some lubricant".
This version leaves about as much space for GMail doing that completely accidentally and without any knowledge nor awareness of the grave effects their action will have as I am willing to leave. I.e. some, but not that much.
I'm sorry, but I find your your comment right there borderline offensive.

Well, as with *most* of important things in life, there is no precise border, crossing of which makes you a monopolist. But I guess we can all agree that if Avaaz sees that as a grave danger, that might be some indication.
Okay, I think you didn't get the crux of the issue.
Avaaz, AFAIK, is *not* using Google's services to distribute mail. Their members/users/activists do for their personal accounts. It's not that Avaaz is *relying* on Google/GMail, it's that they have no say who delivers their mail to a huge part of their users/activists.
Also, it's not a company, it's an NGO.
You *do* see the difference between:
"look, the problem is related to centralisation, considering moving to a different mail provider would be a good idea"
"we demand you move to a different provider immediately"
Avaaz is ~20mln-strong civic organisation operating via on-line petitions to try and convince politicians to sometimes do the right thing. Instead of slandering them, you might want to educate yourself:
Yes, I should have provided the link in my first e-mail, I assumed that on this list Avaaz might be already known. See, everybody makes wrong assumptions from time to time.

Explained it already 2 times, if anybody else asks, I'll be happy to do it for the third time.
This matter is very relevant to me. I believe if somebody is saying "we offer encryption", the encryption should be actually, you know, protecting the data. As it stands now, the GCS encryptions doesn't protect the data from government snooping, from a rogue admin that has access to the master key, and probably from several other scenarios.
And the Google's rep saying "we do not provide the keys to the government" reeks of PR-speak and deception. Of course they do not provide the keys, they can simply provide the cleartext, de-ciphered first via the master key.
They are saying they use encryption, and with several keys/levels. They are saying that during the whole PRISM debate heating up, a debate mind you that has Google among the NSA cooperators. They are even claiming they are not providing the keys to the government, so as to suggest even more strongly that they have cleaned up their act:
"A Google spokeswoman said via email the company does not provide encryption
 keys to any government and provides user data only in accordance with the
 law."
When in fact -- as far as PRISM-related stuff is concerned -- they have done anything but.
No. Google SHOULD provide safe, privacy-aware services and encryption that actually truly protects the data, or at least not claim to do so if they have no intention to.
Or, using your "let's turn the tables and see where that goes" method:
So Google CAN lie and deceive the users by claiming or suggesting to provide a level of service they have no intention of providing?
Nicely done. I see we have a Schopenhauer admirer. "The Art of Being Right" is a great little book indeed:

Had such a centralisation not occured, there would be no serious problem. One of the providers introduces such policies? Fine, whatever, they have a few percent of users at the most, we can live with that.

Instead, what we get is "please, dear users, play according to rules set by this behemoth that can do with e-mail whatever the hell it wants". Hence my (overly ribald for some, as it turns out) metaphor.

Same here.
Well, my bad. Should have been more clear there, I give you that.
I do attribute malice to Google with regard to several of their recent actions (the Jabber debacle and the anti Net Neutrality stance, for starters). With great power (and Google does have great power over the Internet right now, sadly) comes great responsibility; they *should* be aware of what effect their policies have on the rest of the Net.
And I would say, we should *expect* them to be aware of that. Even more -- I am quite sure they *are* aware. And hence, we're getting dangerously close to what could be described as malice: conscious decision to perform actions that are heavily detrimental to a lot of other entities with the only rationale being profit maximalisation.
I shall re-phrase, then:
"We are being fucked in the arse by GMail, so let's ask them politely to use some lubricant".
This version leaves about as much space for GMail doing that completely accidentally and without any knowledge nor awareness of the grave effects their action will have as I am willing to leave. I.e. some, but not that much.
I'm sorry, but I find your your comment right there borderline offensive.

Well, as with *most* of important things in life, there is no precise border, crossing of which makes you a monopolist. But I guess we can all agree that if Avaaz sees that as a grave danger, that might be some indication.
Okay, I think you didn't get the crux of the issue.
Avaaz, AFAIK, is *not* using Google's services to distribute mail. Their members/users/activists do for their personal accounts. It's not that Avaaz is *relying* on Google/GMail, it's that they have no say who delivers their mail to a huge part of their users/activists.
Also, it's not a company, it's an NGO.
You *do* see the difference between:
"look, the problem is related to centralisation, considering moving to a different mail provider would be a good idea"
"we demand you move to a different provider immediately"
Avaaz is ~20mln-strong civic organisation operating via on-line petitions to try and convince politicians to sometimes do the right thing. Instead of slandering them, you might want to educate yourself:
Yes, I should have provided the link in my first e-mail, I assumed that on this list Avaaz might be already known. See, everybody makes wrong assumptions from time to time.

Explained it already 2 times, if anybody else asks, I'll be happy to do it for the third time.
This matter is very relevant to me. I believe if somebody is saying "we offer encryption", the encryption should be actually, you know, protecting the data. As it stands now, the GCS encryptions doesn't protect the data from government snooping, from a rogue admin that has access to the master key, and probably from several other scenarios.
And the Google's rep saying "we do not provide the keys to the government" reeks of PR-speak and deception. Of course they do not provide the keys, they can simply provide the cleartext, de-ciphered first via the master key.
They are saying they use encryption, and with several keys/levels. They are saying that during the whole PRISM debate heating up, a debate mind you that has Google among the NSA cooperators. They are even claiming they are not providing the keys to the government, so as to suggest even more strongly that they have cleaned up their act:
"A Google spokeswoman said via email the company does not provide encryption
 keys to any government and provides user data only in accordance with the
 law."
When in fact -- as far as PRISM-related stuff is concerned -- they have done anything but.
No. Google SHOULD provide safe, privacy-aware services and encryption that actually truly protects the data, or at least not claim to do so if they have no intention to.
Or, using your "let's turn the tables and see where that goes" method:
So Google CAN lie and deceive the users by claiming or suggesting to provide a level of service they have no intention of providing?
Nicely done. I see we have a Schopenhauer admirer. "The Art of Being Right" is a great little book indeed:

For no particular reason I have happened to chose this particular figure of speech, however.
Or, I'm just asking on a pretty technical mailing list if anybody has any contact to an organisation that brushes shoulders with techies on a regular basis, which I would like to contact.
I found many, many times that such a strategy is not problematic to other list members while offering decent probability of success. If it has caused you any distress or anguish, I apologise with utmost sincerity.
Please note that the "contact info" question was just "by the way", and had I not gotten the idea to ask that question I would have sent ("I would have happened to send"?) my e-mail either way (granted, with a bit different

I am not assuming malice on Google's part, at least not in this particular context. But the real problem here is not that the policy is being introduced, it's that of centralisation and overly broad de facto control Google has over (in this case) e-mail communication.
Had such a centralisation not occured, there would be no serious problem. One of the providers introduces such policies? Fine, whatever, they have a few percent of users at the most, we can live with that. And users can switch, no However, with GMail having such a huge slice of the pie, they can literally make or break organisations like Avaaz.
And the right way to deal with that is at least telling the users "look, the problem is related to centralisation, considering moving to a different mail provider would be a good idea".
Instead, what we get is "please, dear users, play according to rules set by this behemoth that can do with e-mail whatever the hell it wants". Hence my (overly ribald for some, as it turns out) metaphor.

I mean "I have subscribed to their list; this list provides clearly marked and functional way of unsubscribing; thus, mail from this source is considered legitimate; and hence sending such mail by them is considered legitimate I'd say it's quite obvious, though.
Same here.
Well, my bad. Should have been more clear there, I give you that.
I do attribute malice to Google with regard to several of their recent actions (the Jabber debacle and the anti Net Neutrality stance, for starters). With great power (and Google does have great power over the Internet right now, sadly) comes great responsibility; they *should* be aware of what effect their policies have on the rest of the Net.
And I would say, we should *expect* them to be aware of that. Even more -- I am quite sure they *are* aware. And hence, we're getting dangerously close to what could be described as malice: conscious decision to perform actions that are heavily detrimental to a lot of other entities with the only rationale being profit maximalisation.
I shall re-phrase, then:
"We are being fucked in the arse by GMail, so let's ask them politely to use some lubricant".
This version leaves about as much space for GMail doing that completely accidentally and without any knowledge nor awareness of the grave effects their action will have as I am willing to leave. I.e. some, but not that much.
I'm sorry, but I find your your comment right there borderline offensive.
censorship debate[2] I could say that many other countries are extremely backwards with regard to some things (censorship, copyright, porn), bot that doesn't get us anywhere, does it.
[1] [2] Not to mention the unwarranted generalisation that "all Poles are ". That has some potential to backfire, after all there is a slim chance you could happen to be talking to an atheist[3]...
[3] Also, the .io domain here might prove problematic to interpret in the context of your previous assumptions, I guess.
Well, as with *most* of important things in life, there is no precise border, crossing of which makes you a monopolist. But I guess we can all agree that if Avaaz sees that as a grave danger, that might be some indication.
Okay, I think you didn't get the crux of the issue.
Avaaz, AFAIK, is *not* using Google's services to distribute mail. Their members/users/activists do for their personal accounts. It's not that Avaaz is *relying* on Google/GMail, it's that they have no say who delivers their mail to a huge part of their users/activists.
Also, it's not a company, it's an NGO.
You *do* see the difference between:
"look, the problem is related to centralisation, considering moving to a different mail provider would be a good idea"
"we demand you move to a different provider immediately"
Avaaz is ~20mln-strong civic organisation operating via on-line petitions to try and convince politicians to sometimes do the right thing. Instead of slandering them, you might want to educate yourself:
Yes, I should have provided the link in my first e-mail, I assumed that on this list Avaaz might be already known. See, everybody makes wrong assumptions from time to time.

Uhm... I'd be very careful with this one:
And most of these cases are a relic of a bygone era when Google actually practised what they preach, because they were the small, geeky underdog pitted against giants like Microsoft.
Now they themselves are a giant and are slowly but steadily abandoning their open-source, open-standards ways in favour of walled-gardens, proprietary protocols and such.

Explained it already 2 times, if anybody else asks, I'll be happy to do it for the third time.
This matter is very relevant to me. I believe if somebody is saying "we offer encryption", the encryption should be actually, you know, protecting the data. As it stands now, the GCS encryptions doesn't protect the data from government snooping, from a rogue admin that has access to the master key, and probably from several other scenarios.
And the Google's rep saying "we do not provide the keys to the government" reeks of PR-speak and deception. Of course they do not provide the keys, they can simply provide the cleartext, de-ciphered first via the master key.
They are saying they use encryption, and with several keys/levels. They are saying that during the whole PRISM debate heating up, a debate mind you that has Google among the NSA cooperators. They are even claiming they are not providing the keys to the government, so as to suggest even more strongly that they have cleaned up their act:
"A Google spokeswoman said via email the company does not provide encryption
 keys to any government and provides user data only in accordance with the
 law."
When in fact -- as far as PRISM-related stuff is concerned -- they have done anything but.
No. Google SHOULD provide safe, privacy-aware services and encryption that actually truly protects the data, or at least not claim to do so if they have no intention to.
Or, using your "let's turn the tables and see where that goes" method:
So Google CAN lie and deceive the users by claiming or suggesting to provide a level of service they have no intention of providing?
Nicely done. I see we have a Schopenhauer admirer. "The Art of Being Right" is a great little book indeed:
I'm just not sure if that's   or  I'd go for  I guess.
