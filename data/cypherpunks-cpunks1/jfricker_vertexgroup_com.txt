Doubleclick was the company.
They place banner ads on other pages that deliver a cookie header to your
browser. Their trick is a script that delivers a cookie along with the graphic.
Here's a sample from one of their own ads:
Set-Cookie: IAF=x; path=/; expires=Wed, 09-Nov-99 23:59:00 GMT
And right from the horses mouth:
"DoubleClick has created the largest and most complete user and
organization database on the Internet. DoubleClick is able to tell an
incredible amount of information about a user, such as operating system,
location, organization name, type, revenue, and size (click here for a
more detailed description of target selection criteria). Along with
sophisticated scheduling and our incredible DART software,
DoubleClick is able to automatically and dynamically assign the best ad
banner for a user."
"DoubleClick development ad banners are designed to capture more
data about an individual or to attract potential advertisers, both of which
ultimately benefit all DoubleClick Network member Web sites."
Pomp and Puffery. But it makes the marketeers drool.
As a user downloads more doubleclick banners, the cookie allows doubleclick
to  accumulate more crumbs in the form of url of the referring page. Just as
traditional marketing demographics were founded on what magazines one
subscribes, web advertising hopes to build demographics on what pages you view. 1) Don't put your name in the netscape configuration (d'oh)
2) make your cookie.txt file read only
3) use  when surfing
Turning of "auto-load images" will not prevent the doubleclick cookie from

My main concern regarding access to this information rests in the fact that
this database has always been available to anyone who understood how to get
it and use it. Recently I received a letter from some credit card company
offering to provide me with my credit report, social security history, and
insurance related records  on a regular basis (for a fee of course). How
about my police, fbi, school, and dating records while we're at it. How much
is already available only to those that know the ropes.
Well today AP ran another story about the reaction surrounding Aaron's
actions. Nice picture of the back of Aaron's head. They didn't print is
lisense plate number either.
ObCypherpunks: How many people do you know that are working on a day to day
basis with medical records systems, the District Attorney's computers, your
doctor's computers, state Department of Health, and so on. I'm sure it's
come up before but isn't this an obvious of application of encryption and
PAK (Public Access to Keys)? Any legislation currently to _require_ that
medical records and such be encrypted with access restricted. Something like: Alice (my primary care giver) and I each have the key to the
records that Alice stores. Bob (my dentist) has a legitimate need to these
records so I issue Alice and Bob a new key. With that key, the software
allows Alice to make a replicate (synchonizable at that) of the record and
transfer it to Bob who uses his key to access the data. It may even be that
_any_ time, any of the replicas are to be accessed _my_ private key must be
employed although one may argue that in times of tragedy it would be prudent
to get my medical history immediately. I would say there is little in those
records that would help an emergency room doctor make life saving desisions.
That anything that the ER should know about me to save my life should be on
a Medical Emergency Bracelet. I guess it would not matter if you encrypted
with a key short enough to mumble from the back of an ambulance.
The market for encryption enabled applications is just about to take off.

Well where there's a will there's a way.
I agree that the general public and the market place often lacks the power
to affect particular events. Central planning can facility certain
processes. Free-marketers may argue that I can query and select based upon
my encryption criteria but chances are my psychiatrist will do nothing more
than "make note" of paranoia and ponder it's significance: "Do you resent
your mother?"
I am not a great fan of social engineering and regulations. Yet the
legisture in Oregon may get called for a special session to address this
issue and I see this an opportunity for a grander arguement than merely
acccess to the DMV data. And as much as we dislike the presence of the
governments they do indeed exist. Living within their domain limits our
choices to either: complacency through inaction (cynicism et al), attempts
at isolation (back to the land), or taking an active role through voting,
education, civil disobedience or participation in the process (a pox on
party politics! the latter choice is easily the least enticing while civil
disobedience can be truly fun! >g<). Ok so call me a statist and shove me
out the door, but I am not argueing for the existance of a state. It does
currently exist and I am not self-sufficient. But I digress.
So.  My state legislature may very well get called to address this issue. Do
they have any concept of the big picture here? That the DMV data is one
small part of a debate regarding privacy which needs to be addressed. This
is an opportunity for some education and by the end of the day I should know
if my representatives are willing to listen.
 The records industry (for lack of a better term to encompass all
companies that accumulate data on individuals) needs some standards and
guidelines. Or walls and fences. Maybe even bars and a moat! And the sooner
the better. Federally imposed software requirements are not uncommon in
certain industries. It is time for standards for the personal data
maintained by co-operating entities (ie agencies the public co-operates with
such as doctors, the DMV, and so on).
 The goal is the anonymous citizen. The first step it to secure the data
currently exposed. Can this be done _without_ legislation?

The January 1997 Dr. Dobb's Journal has a somewhat interesting interview with Eva Bozoki, Chief Scientist for Digital Secured Networks which more about scientific research in the old USSR as it does about VPN's and encryption. Some notable quotes from Ms. Bozoki:
"If people understand our competence, they will trust the product."
"I don't like key escrow because I don't trust anybody."
"We add a twist by encrypting the public key exchange."
Seems like the interviewer had a nice chat with Ms. Bozoki but it is a shame that he did not press her on more technical details. It is after all a programmer's journal. I find the first two quotes interesting in that it would appear that Ms. Bozoki would not purchase the product she is creating! In order to establish trust in an encryption product more is required than simply agreeing that the company is competent. Competence does not imply trustworthiness. Trust can be established through review and examination of the innards, algo's and source code. A quick read of  does not reveal any additional information on the crypto used (other than it being a 512 byte public key algo using Diffie-Hellman key exchange). Yet it would seem that DSNT has painted themselves into a corner as revealing their architecture would make encrypting the public keys ineffective.
The interviewer also failed to press Ms. Bozoki for a position regarding key escrow. She states that she does not like key escrow but she does say (when discussing how security is being retrofitted into TCP/IP) "So you have to make sure that certain secrets don't go out and that you can legally wiretap certain conversations in a situation which wasn't designed for that." And also she mentions "the need for a government to defend its country". So does DSNT's products support wiretapping out of the box?

Peter's paper is an interesting overview of data recovery technology. He does conclude that his 35 write regiment will overwrite all signals on hard disk media. It would seem that performing the 35 writes multiple times would yield an securely erased drive. Yet he clearly is not an expert in data recovery, is organizing others research, and does not provide evidence or tests for his postulates such as the need for a good PRNG. It would be quite interesting to send a disk off to a data recovery company after running through Peter's method with perhaps different parts of the disk treated differently. Also, the section on RAM talks about data persistance but does not cover recovery methods other than SRAM power up bias. Nor is the RAM section referenced. RAM is so active that it would seem little pertinent data could be recovered if any.
So, in spite of not being an expert myself I am not convinced that any very well funded entity can recover data that has been overwritten an arbitrarily large number of times. Of course the relative value of my personal data is low and my level of paranoia follows. One can not be called reactionary by recommending a "no-trust" policy. Reading the paper reminds me how long ago it was that I studied the physics of microelectronic devices. Yow!

Not exactly. Win32 API's include the ability for a program to impersonate any known user. Besides ActiveX (OLE really) has nothing to do with services. In order to make ActiveX secure there would need to be a virtual machine with access to a limitted API only. Sound familiar?
There is no such thing on WinNT.
Why is that a problem? ActiveX components are shipped as discrete objects with a known DLL like interface. DLL's are unloaded when the load counter is zero so they don't hang around in memory after the ActiveX job is done. You also cannot write a "proxy to the file system" in a DLL. That's a special device driver called a filter. Of course there is this Mark Russinovich fellow that is showing how this is not exactly true. It is possible to identify all entry points in a DLL.

The only way to combat the powerful who would seek to rewrite history is to create an authenticatable system for document storage.

    RANGOON, BURMA, 1996 SEP 27 (NB) -- Burma has made owning, using,
    importing or borrowing a modem or fax machine without government
    permission a crime, punishable by up to 15 years in jail, according

    Burma's military government has imposed what's called "The Computer

    UPI quotes the government-run newspaper New Light of Myanmar as

    ministry, or who uses computer network and information technology
    "for undermining state security, law and order, national unity,
    national economy and national culture, or who obtains or transmits
    state secrets."
    UPI reports that in July a diplomat, Leo Nichols, died in prison
    after he was sentenced to a lengthy term for illegal possession of
    fax machines.
    It's clear from this action that the SLORC, i.e. the "State Law and
    Order Restoration Committee" (sic!) understands full well the
    benefits and importance of the Internet and other forms of
    electronic communication to open societies, and is determined to
    deny these benefits to its citizens.  Given its recent history and
    the quasi-imprisonment of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, this new action is
    perfectly consistent with the government's previous abysmal
    record.
    Countries who would deny open Internet access to its citizens might
    well pause to consider if they wish to be associated with the
    current government of Myanmar in doing so.

The install is only 5MBs. Part of that 10MB package is a silly collection of
netscape plugins which don't have to be installed. I guess they could be
nice if I tried them.
It also only works on NT4 regardless of what the web page says.
With it's ability to run a program on receiving an email based upon filter
criteria the possibilities are endless. (I know I know old hat for unix but
so whiz bang for NTnoids like me.)

@_subject: What the NSA is patenting 
This excerpt from a Wired article/interview
"No data is totally safe," says Sharp, who runs his Data Recovery Labs from
the coincidentally named town of Safety Harbor,
Florida. "But you can recover data that's been overwritten up to nine times.
The only way to permanently remove data is with
programs that can do a 'severe security erase,' when the drive is
over-written 10 consecutive times." Believe it or don't!

Actually Sharp appears only in that one quote. The article is poorly
editted. The rest of the article quotes some other data recovery experts and
"Sharp" is never mentioned again.
It's fun to debunk journalists but it takes more than saying "it's bunk".

For some reason I find seeing satellites flying in formation rather
disturbing. The classic 3-4-5 right triangle makes somebody's math easier,
I'm sure. I have watched the sky for 20 years and seeing that pattern glide
across the sky made we wonder just what the shuttle is doing up there. How
many satellites have been placed in orbit? How precise are their positions?

Well I think the Star of David has so many meanings that the message may get
muddled. Seems like busy sites can support the mirror of their choice by
putting a note such as "This is a Radikal site". The "mispelling" is the medium.
Tell two people. Put up a mirror. Add a link on a busy page. Did I miss
 is a Radikal site

Well IPSec provides for authentication of endpoints which would identify the
syn attacker.
What amazes me is that routers happily pass packets with foreign IP return
addresses. I guess there is some valid utility to being able to originate a
connection that actually goes somewhere else for intiating a many to many
protocol. But I can't think of any practical application that would
necessarily be that way.
So why do routers let packets leave local networks that do not appear to
originate from said local network? Doesn't routing work "both ways" so to speak?
