When you log on to the FastTrack network, you are
routed by a FastTrack
                  server to what are called SuperNodes that contain
lists of user files you can
                  search, connect to, and download. Members
automatically host
                  SuperNodes on their PCs when needed -- and the number
of SuperNodes
                  grows and shrinks relative to demand. SuperNode
computers are clustered
                  by the thousands, so one search for a file may be
handled by a hundred PC
                  SuperNodes that intelligently rout and distribute
requests, according to
                  FastTrack chief executive Niklas Zennstrom.
                  Zennstrom says the number of users on its network has
been doubling each
                  month, from 200,000 in June to 440,000 today, even
higher than
                  Webnoize's estimates. According to FastTrack, one
million files were
                  downloaded from its network last week. It reports 3.5
million copies of its
                  software have been downloaded through its largest
customer, MusicCity.

                                     Adding a bit of an ironic twist to
the brewing
                                     legal matter on alleged copyright
                                     infringement between Adobe Systems
                                     Moscow-based ElcomSoft Ltd., The
                                     Times reported the latest events in
its July 4
                                     edition -- available in PDF.
                                     Adobe Systems was closed the week
of the
                                     national U.S. holiday.
                                     In a page 9 article titled "E-Book
                                     Hit Barnes & Noble," the online,
                                     English-language newspaper quotes a
                                     & Noble VP as saying the company's
                                     store "incurred considerable losses
due to the pause in sales of new bestsellers."
                                     The company stopped sales for a day
late last month to allow Adobe to release
                                     version (2.2) of its free Acrobat
eBook Reader, an upgrade with enhanced
                                     security that could not be
decrypted by ElcomSoft's commercially available
                                     Advanced Ebook Processor (AEBPR)
                                     The Times reports that -- as had
previously been forewarned in coverage on our
                                     Planet eBook sister site -- in
response to Adobe's threatened legal action for
                                     copyright infringement, ElcomSoft
is now giving away an updated, reduced
                                     functionality version of AEBPR.
According to the company's Web site, this free
                                     demo version of AEBPR 2.2 has been
modified to support limited decryption -- 25
                                     percent of the content -- "only to
demonstrate that Adobe technology (used in
                                     Adobe Content Server, Adobe WebBuy
and Acrobat eBook Reader) is still weak."
                                     "The electronic book world has
produced its own Napster," Alexander Katalov,
                                     Elcomsoft's General Manager, told
the Moscow Times. He also reportedly denied
                                     blame for any wrongdoing, pointing
to PDF security as the real issue. In
                                     defending the company's initial
development and sale of AEBPR, he told the Times
                                     that the product "was often
purchased by people with poor eyesight, since
                                     Adobe's e-book software did not
permit the use of programs for reading text out
                                     loud."
                                     In fact, Adobe's eBook Reader
                                     does allow ebooks to be read
                                     aloud (when using a computer
                                     with voice activation
                                     capabilities) -- *if* the
                                     publisher, not Adobe -- chooses
                                     to grant that permission.
                                     Adobe had threatened ElcomSoft with
copyright infringement in violation of the
                                     Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA), specifically Section 1201 -- for
                                     circumventing its rights-protection
designed to guard the rights of publishers and
                                     authors. In legal circles, there
currently are debates taking place over the use of
                                     encryption systems for digital
content that are more restrictive for users than
                                     laws dealing with printed books.
For example, its commonplace -- and legal -- for
                                     someone to re-sell a printed book;
as an ebook, with most current technologies,
                                     that would be considered a
violation of copyright.
                                     The Moscow Times' article cites the
operator of a
                                     Russian Web site on copyright as
saying that by
                                     simply posting a URL where it now
freely gives
                                     away AEBPR, ElcomSoft is safe from
                                     "according to current Russian
judicial practice."
                                     Adobe Systems -- known in the
industry for its strong anti-piracy litigation --
                                     seems likely to put that notion to
a test, while needing to take steps to further
                                     strengthen PDF security and to
educate users on proper security implementation
                                     techniques -- keeping in mind there
is no perfect, never-fail solution.
                                     Like The Moscow Times, part of
Independent Media, The St. Petersburg Times
                                     newspaper also publishes
English-language news from Russia -- also in PDF.
                                     The complete 31-page, July 4 issue
is available online -- as a large PDF file [PDF:
                                     6.2 MB] (and also in HTML).

E-Book Duplicators
Hit Barnes & Noble
By Yury Granovsky
Barnes & Noble.com, the No. 1 U.S.
online book store, halted the sale of
electronic books after Russian company
Elcomsoft began selling a program
to illegally copy text.
Under pressure from Adobe Systems,
which created the protective
software for the e-books, Elcomsoft
was compelled to discontinue the sales
of its ?hacker? program.
It is now distributing that program
for free.
Barnes & Noble.com?s electronic
book department was closed from
June 26 to 27 until Adobe provided
new protection for e-books.
Mark Fagnitno, vice president of
Barnes & Noble.com, said the Internet
store incurred considerable losses due
to the pause in sales of new bestsellers
by Arthur C. Clark
and Steven King, but
he did not give any
A m a z o n . c o m ,
frightened by the actions
of the Russian
company, revamped
all Adobe protective
software a day later.
There are several
formats for electronic books with protection
from unauthorized copying.
The most popular formats belong
to Adobe Systems, Microsoft and
The user installs a free program
into his computer ? Adobe?s eBook
Reader, for example ? which generates
a personal electronic certificate
that is assigned to a particular personal
While buying a book via the Internet,
the user sends the online store his
certificate number. The store then
makes a copy of the electronic text for
the user ? which cannot be copied,
printed or transferred to other computers.
However, Elcomsoft developed
Advanced eBook Processor software,
which can convert purchased books
into PDF, a widely disseminated format
that makes books available ?to everyone
and for any purpose? without
actually hacking the Internet stores?
This software was offered for sale
in late June at Alexander Katalov, Elcomsoft?s
general manager, said Adobe itself is
to blame since it marketed a faulty
?Adobe is promoting an incomplete
technology and isn?t concerned
about its safety. No wonder that in an
analogy with the musical format MP3,
the electronic book world has produced
its own Napster and MP3.com,?
he said.
Katalov added that his software
people could crack the new Adobe ebook
protection ?within half an hour
Katalov does not consider his actions
blameworthy. He says that Advanced
eBook Processor, which sold
for $100 each, was often purchased by
people with poor eyesight since
Adobe?s e-book software did not permit
the use of programs for reading
text out loud.
Elcomsoft?s web
site also offers programs
for ?helping
users recall the passwords
of ICQ and of
Microsoft Word documents?
? in other
words, for cracking
the programs.
Neither of the
companies have
brought a lawsuit against Elcomsoft.
However, Verio ? a U.S. company
that is Elcomsoft?s provider along with
Digital River, the owner of RegNow,
through which the Russian company
conducts business ? took Adobe?s
side after receiving a letter June 25
that described the situation.
Verio has terminated the site of the
company; later, had to shift to a new provider. Digital
River has stopped taking orders for
the disputed program.
Under pressure, Elcomsoft has
stopped marketing the software ?
which is now available for free. ?We
have published the web address from
which the program can be taken for
free,? Katalov said, ?and in the future
we will probably publish the cracking
algorithm for eBook.?
?In this case there could be no
claims on the company whatsoever,?
said Viktor Mashchenkov, the operating
partner of eBuro.ru, a juridical web
?According to current Russian judicial
practice, one can?t be tried for a
web address.?
