My fellow Cypherpunks, The following is interesting.
find string: Connie Chung
A good example of the tremendous degree to which the major news media organizations are called to heel is seen in the facts surrounding the two year hiatus in the professional career of CBS broadcaster Connie Chung, who had the misfortune to have ended up being paired with Dan Rather several years ago.
On a live call-in TV talk show some two years ago, Ms. Chung responded with a bit too much candor to a question as to what actually gets reported publicly by the major news media, given the great number of stories and items which come from the numerous sources of "raw" information. How are the stories which get the attention of the media chosen and by whom?
Connie Chung replied to the effect that it wasn't too hard to decide what stories get aired--they just checked with Washington D.C. to see what had been cleared for publication by the government.
As a result of her being foolish enough to tell the truth in what was likely just a naive, probably unintentional and inadvertent slip, within no more than a few hours Ms. Chung was out of a job and remained blacklisted in the industry for a good two years, only resurfacing in 1998 with a position at ABC--sufficiently chastened, some no doubt believe, to allow her to grace the public airwaves once again.

Declan, my source is the net address listed below. At
the top of that page are a "general info" button and a
"contact us" button. Under "general info" they list
info at iraap.org as their email address. They also list
there their snail mail address.
   That's all I know of the source. This looks like a job
for an investgative reporter such as yourself:-) Sorry I
am not more helpful. If you can actually validate from
tv network sources that that sequel occurred, you will have a great big can of worms to play with :-)
-Good luck!

Fellow Cypherpunks,
                     THE LAWYER GAMBIT
   I remember reading in old anti-IRS literature about a technique for
avoiding prosecutions. A client would tell a lawyer that he wanted to
do something and would ask if it were legal to do. The lawyer would
then give his opinion as to wheather it was legal or not. If the lawyer
said that it was legal and gave his opinion in writing, then the
client could proceed without out worry. The lawyer's opinion would stop
any criminal prosecution.
   I wonder if this would work with publishing crypt code. I think it
might put the lawyer at risk. If we had a lawyer who really thought
that publishing crypt code on the Internet was legal and wasn't afraid
of sticking his neck out then his published statement on the Internet
to this might open the floodgates of crypt code Internet posting for
   Donald has stated that the law in this area is quite vague. I would
think even if the law prohibited it, then the law would be unconstitu-
tional and therefore null and void.
   Any thoughts on this?
Yours Truly,

Where are the crypt source blackboards?
Fellow Cypherpunks,
   It occurs to me that in mailing lists that concern crypt programming
there should be posts with programs and large code fragments of crypt
source lines. I don't remember seeing any such on Cypherpunks and the
little I've checked out on Coderpunks I haven't seen any there either.
   I know that in Amerika it may or may not be illegal to post crypt
source code, but I would think that foreign members would post crypt
code. So, where is it? For Amerikans, they should at least be posting
links to source code "blackboards" in order to develope crypt code. I
don't even find that.
   To what degree is the prohibition of posting crypt source code having
a negative impact on crypt developement and deployment?
Yours Truly,
Gary Jeffers

@_subject: Gnutella scanning instead of service providers. 
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   It has been stated that Gnutella is completely decentralized. This is
not so. In order to get started with a Gnutella search, you need to use
a Gnutella search provider to find Gnutella groups.
   Would it be possible to write some kind of scanner that would look
at an ISP, say for example, htc.net and display all the Gnutella users
there? We seem to be over the "fax effect" (a Snelling point?)
magnitude where automated hunting for Gnutella users would be practical.
Also, maybe the scanner could search thru various ISP's as well as
particular ones. If it did close ISPs 1st, then it could help with the
efficency of file searches.
   Also, note that Gnutella deals in files - ANY kind of files. I
suppose that most? Cypherpunks know that - but just to be sure.
   If a scanner were written and widely deployed, then I think that
the problem of crushing Gnutella would be at least a magnitude harder.
Maybe the Gnutella support sites would promote and distribute such
a scanner?

@_subject: Gnutella scanning instead of service providers. 
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   Ray Dillinger believes that scanning would assist oppressors as
much as regular users. Joseph Ashwood agrees with this and further
thinks that the Internet overhead of a scanner would be a serious
   I still think that scanners would be effective. Here's why:
   Gnutella still exists, Napster doesn't! Security does not have to be
bulletproof in all cases. Gnutella is a harder target than was Napster.
There may be other reasons why Gnutella is alive and Napster is dead.
I would think the ability to pin blame on the target might be another    A scan enabled Gnutella would be a much harder target than a central
service provided Gnutella. The scan enabled version would be much harder to shut down due to various kinds of expenses - legal, administ-
rative, politics, etc.. Not impossible to shut down - just harder,
slower, and with various expenses we would like the oppressors to pick
up :-)
   Also, with lack of centralization, it would be much harder to pin
legal blame on the servers(users). - Much harder, slower, and
politically expensive. This is generally a sort of economics problem
for oppressors.
   As far as Joseph Ashwood's claim that the Internet overhead would be
too much. Is his point exaggerated? Would it be possible to write low
overhead scanners? I do not have the "skill set" to say. Maybe he is
right, maybe not. Anybody got something definitive to say on this?

@_subject: Fwd: Re: Tim May and anonymous flames. 
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   Some time ago Tim May flamed me and I responded with the post:
Tim May goes bush shooting.
   .
Note: The 3rd reference was bad. The corrected reference is:
   .
   This has gotten me thinking and I have the following
and conjectures:
1. It is predictable that Tim May will be flammed. The FBI has a
  history of covertly sowing internal dissent in dissident groups.
  As a leading Cypherpunk, May is an obvious target.
2. Anonymous flames are dirt cheap and safe for the FBI.
3. The FBI will do them well. By definition, the flames will be
  professional :-)
4. The flames will be worded so as to distress the target.
5. The flames will be seeded with clues to imply that a particular
  Cypherpunk did them: distinctive syntax, mispellings, phrases,
  This will help make the group ineffective.
6. Other leading Cypherpunks will also be targeted.
7. The anonymous flames will be hard to falsify in their pointing
  to a particular Cypherpunk.
8. Does anybody have reason to believe that the above is not true?
9. Anybody have any good defenses against this attack.
10. Has this topic been brought up before? Yes, I know! -countless
  times and I have not done my homework. :-)
