@_subject: Threat to Australian internet WAS Re: USPS 
If u think this is a worry, u should take a look at what the government owned monoploly telco here in Australia is doing..
 > Or 'they' can use our Telco (Tel$tra) 's approach and introduce _timecharged_ local data calls as it is trying to do here in Australia.
What better or easier way to destroy our meagre outlet for free speech than to cost it out of existance.
See Stewart Fist's excellent article on the subject currently available on "The Australian" newspapers site:

Is this _really_ the EFF policy on anonymopus remailers??
I will check with our local version of the EFF and see what they have to say.
If the EFF is not for anonymity it needs to be publicised. Perhaps the EFF has been in bed with the political pigs too long. *OINK*

@_subject: Why PGP isn't so ubiquitous (was NRC Session Hiss) 
I think that is the main reason PGP is not more common place. If it was seamlessly integrated with Windows software such as mailers I am sure it would be used widely. It will be interesting to see if this develops.
I think it is actually easy to use, although granted others may not; but that people tend not to use it as a matter of course (and it is my belief this is a desireable thing) due too the time taken to manually sign mail or sign and encrypt. Lets face it the average user has trouble with a dos command prompt and until there is a point and click emailer easily available most people just won't try PGP for email. It would also raise the general awareness of PGP and encryption and privacy issues I hope as it is my experience that outside the dedicated and the interested, very few have even heard of PGP or realise that their email may be read easily by persons other than the intended recipient. If this should occurr the horse would have bolted as far as any attempts at government outlawing its use; by and large; or at the very least would make it impossible to pass laws banning PGP without the public at large realising that they might possibly be loosing something which at the moment I doubt many would having never used encryption for email.
