@_subject: CVS: cvs.openbsd.org: ports 
I've already made a similar message to the ports list.  It was shot down.
But maybe now that we see the "trouble" with the current setup, we can
re-evaluate that.  Personally, I think we could share 95% of the ports
stuff between open/freebsd, but it would be nice to have the ability to
fix things in a local cvs tree, without having to wait for the fix to go
through channels.

Right on what?  You see, the bios clock should be in UCT time...
Just to complete things, TIMEZONE is in minutes, and DST is a flag,
set to 1 if the bios clock does DST time.  At least I believe that is
how it works...
