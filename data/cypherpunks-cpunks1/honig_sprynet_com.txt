Let me save you the trouble.  First, RFC 1750 gives some background
including the info-theory behind bit 'distillation'.
I have digitized FM radio hiss using a $10 transistor radio feeding
into the LINE in of my soundcard.  The spectrum looks poisson
with prominant, periodically spaced noise spikes.  It does not pass Diehard.
But if you take the PARITY of 8 bits to get one bit, then assemble bytes
out of these bits, the results pass Diehard.  This works with 44Khz, 16 bit sampling, with full-volume hiss feeding the
I have yet to try this with a video adc sampling snow.

2. Diehard is invaluable.
3. Language is so vague.  Don't export this filter:

Takes 8 bytes, computes the parity of each, composes a byte from the bits.

You should probably look for native freeware, no?
Otherwise look in various win archives.
I have not yet done systematic experiments looking at, e.g., entropy in
full-amplitude noise, or intentionally filtering out various pieces
of spectrum.  The tables in RFC 1750 show that 8 bits is reasonable.
Interestingly, the parity of a $10 10year old Radio shack monophonic
FM radio, UNSHIELDED, in a digitally-noisy environment, sampled at 44Khz and 16 bits, passed Diehard.  NB: Consumer computainment devices will include FM/TV receivers very shortly.

The engineering issue is this: no matter how great you filter out the junk, you don't have a perfect analog measurement to start with.
(Note that filtering out junk reduces info content).
So the question is how to distill the bits out of your binary digits.
You need to reduce the number of bits; you need to make them equiprobable.
I have not had luck*time implementing Shannon's method for distilling bits,
mentioned as suggestion  in the RFC.  This method produces perfect 0:1 ratio
but takes indeterminate input bits to do so.  Please post if you play with

Given that the cheapo radio was 10 cm from a 21" monitor, I don't think
you need to invoke noise-driven resonances in the humble radio.
I was/am interested in robust methods that don't depend on exquisite analog equalization, etc.  Zero crossings are analogs (pun intended) of RFC1750's  method (via Shannon):
map 01 -> 1 map 10 -> 0
00, 11 are no-ops.  Note that for a digital signal you are detecting level-changes.  (Vdd/2
Waiting for zero crossing will give you perfect 0:1 ratio,
but you may have to wait arbitrarily long (but will almost
certainly not, in the formal sense ---there's a decaying exponential

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Oct. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp.'s (Nasdaq:

obtain government approval to export nonkey recovery-based 128-bit-strength
encryption for general commercial use. WebTV Networks pioneered low-cost
access to the Internet, e-mail, financial services and electronic shopping
through a television set and a standard phone line. The WebTV(TM) Network service, combined with the WebTV-based Internet
terminals and receivers, is the first communications system permitted by
the U.S. government to provide strong encryption for general use by
non-U.S. citizens in Japan and the United Kingdom. Such strong encryption
allows Japanese and United Kingdom subscribers of WebTV to communicate
through the WebTV Network (both within national borders and
internationally) without fear of interception by unauthorized parties.

@_subject: PRNGs and testers. 
A *sequence* isn't random; a process is.   A sequence may be the result of
some process, but its always a sample of a process.
When you ask, "Is some process random", you *must* define "random"
operationally, thus, finitely.
A test for structure, such as Marsaglia's "Diehard" suite, measures various statistics (structure) of a sample and compares
them to the measurements you'd get for (abstractly modelled, "real")
randomness.  If the particular tests you've chosen don't see some structure that's present in the sample, you'll mistakenly accept the process as "random".  Diehard is nice because it includes
complex stats and some Monte Carlo evaluations.
Marsaglia's test was designed to find problems in PRNGs, which he was
working on.
Maurer suggests a way to compute the entropy of the data, taken as N-bit
blocks, and computes the value you'd compute for random data.  His test
consumes a lot more data, and is Now, a PRNG has a finite amount of (unknown) initial internal state.
This state is expanded into the output stream, which goes on forever,
thus the finite initial entropy is spread infinitestimally thin.
A true RNG, even an imperfect one, generates a constant amount of entropy
per symbol ("bit per baud" averaged over any sufficiently large window).

@_subject: bug in my Maurer code; retraction of claim; ref 
There was a numerical bug in the C code for Maurer's Univ. Stat. Test
for Randomness which I posted.  The "float" variable "Sum" should be "double".  This will cause an incorrect input-size dependence
for large >40Mbyte files.
Measuring (with the fixed version) the output of a block cipher in feedback
mode, I find that it DOES NOT differ from truly nondeterministic noise, as
I had claimed.  The difference I had observed was due to a larger sample
size for my cipher-noise.  Boy do I feel stupid.
Needless to say, sorry about any inconvenience.
The fixed code follows at the bottom.  This version also spits out
an early estimate after a million samples; this turns out to be
very close to the final value for (homogenous) large samples.
I recently found the following amendment to Maurer's work
at Abstract. Maurer's universal test is a very common randomness test, capable
of detecting a wide gamut of statistical defects. The algorithm is simple
(a few Java code lines), flexible (a variety of parameter combinations can
be chosen by the tester) and fast.
Although the test is based on sound probabilistic grounds, one of its
crucial parts uses the heuristic approximation:
c(L,K) = 0.7 - 0.8/L + (1.6 + 12.8/L)K-4/L
In this work we compute the precise value of c(L,K) and show that the
inaccuracy due to the heuristic estimate can make the test 2.67 times more
permissive than what is theoretically admitted.
Moreover, we etablish a new asymptotic relation between the test parameter
and the source's entropy.

On a radio data network: See In this Memorandum we consider something we have earlier referred to as
"poor-boy" microwave. The "poor-boy" designation resulted from an imposed
constraint on the design of an ensemble of microwave communications
equipments--namely, that the designer should have to pay for the system out
of his own pocket! Even so, a look at price tags for anything to do with
any large electronic or communications system would appear to render the
term "poor-boy" inappropriate. "Mini-cost," a contraction of
"minimum-cost," now seems more fitting.
Mini-cost microwave, therefore, is a minimum-cost, line-of-sight microwave
communications system designed to transmit digital information in as
inexpensive a manner as possible. It is one way of building the links for
the proposed Distributed Adaptive Message Block communications system with
which this series of Memoranda is concerned.
The distributed system itself is designed around digital modulation, using
redundant paths selected on an instant-by-instant basis. The communications
links for such a system can be built in a different manner than their
equivalents in today's systems, taking advantage of the system's less rigid
distortion level and tandem reliability requirements. The fundamental
objective for the system's links is that they permit formation of new
routes cheaply (a necessary survivability criterion), yet allow
transmission on the order of millions of bits per second (see ODC-I,
-VII[1]); system reliability and a low raw error rate are secondary. And,
since future networks conveying military traffic must be designed with the
expectation of heavy damage, powerful digital error detection and error
removal methods have been built into the system.

'Mafiaboy' trying to stare down
                prosecutors Lawyer: If teen accused
                of shutting down Web sites of CNN,
                Yahoo has to go to trial, prosecutors
                will pay
                By Kevin Johnson
                USA TODAY
                MONTREAL -- Nearly a year after a hacker shut down some
                of the biggest names on the Internet -- causing an estimated
                $1.3 billion in lost business -- prosecutors and lawyers
                representing a defendant known as ''Mafiaboy'' are locked in
                a high-stakes game of chicken over whether the case will go
                to trial.                 The 16-year-old is charged with the cyber equivalent of
                breaking and entering in assaults last winter that shut down
                sites operated by Yahoo, eBay, CNN and E-Trade.                 The attacks, in which the Web sites were overloaded with
                requests from supercomputers infected with a program
                planted by a hacker, affected millions of Internet users
                worldwide.
                If convicted, prosecutors say, Mafiaboy -- whose name is
                being withheld because he is a juvenile -- could face up to
                years confinement in a youth center, $1,000 in fines and up to
                240 hours of community service.
                Prosecutors are willing to consider a plea agreement, but only
                if it includes some confinement.
                Absolutely not, says the teen's attorney, who vows that if
                prosecutors stick to that position, they'll be sorry.                 Yan Romanowski says his client is bracing for a protracted
                trial, lasting four to six months, during which the defense
                demand that the government show the computer program that
                brought the Internet giants to their knees.
                Internet security experts are calling the strategy
blackmail, and
                prosecutors say they do not believe that publicizing the
                program, which Mafiaboy allegedly found on the Internet,
                would be necessary.
                Nevertheless, Romanowski, in a likely attempt to gain
                leverage in plea-bargain talks, is playing hardball. The
                plans to challenge the legality of wiretaps that allowed Royal
                Canadian Mounted Police to collect 40 days of telephone
                conversations, during which the teenager is alleged to have
                bragged about his exploits behind the keyboard.                 The wiretaps were planted after authorities traced computer
                ''fingerprints'' left on one supercomputer used in the attacks
                back to Mafiaboy. ''If that evidence is eliminated,''
                Romanowski says, ''the whole case gets kicked.''
                If the evidence stands, as prosecutor Louis Miville-Deschenes
                expects, the defense envisions a courtroom drama that will
                require some of the biggest players in electronic commerce to
                testify as embarrassed victims of a boy's mischief. ''This is
                not an open-and-closed case by any means,'' Romanowski
                says.
                Perhaps, but the lawyer's client might have not have helped
                matters when he was arrested last Friday and accused of
                violating the terms of his bail by repeatedly breaking school
                rules at Riverdale High. He remained in custody Monday
                night and was scheduled for a detention hearing today.                 ''The kid has been a general pain in the posterior,''
                Miville-Deschenes says.                 This Friday, the teenager is expected to answer the hacking
                charges. Romanowski says he plans to plead not guilty.                 As part of any plea negotiation, prosecutors have asked him
                to participate in debriefing sessions with Canadian
                and possibly U.S. investigators to discuss his relationships
                with a vast, international network of associates.
                Like detention, that's also unacceptable to the defense, say
                Romanowski and John Calce, 45, Mafiaboy's father.                 Because of ''loyalty,'' Calce says, there is no chance his son
                would sit down with authorities to discuss his private
                communications with friends. ''I don't think he'll be
                cooperating with them.''
                In a bizarre case that parallels the one involving his son,
                is facing a conspiracy charge because of what Canadian
                authorities heard on the telephone wiretap designed to garner
                evidence against his son.
                Investigators say they decided to move in on both of them the
                morning of April 15 after phone transmissions picked up
                Calce, who is president of a transportation company, allegedly
                planning to have someone rough up a business associate.                 Romanowski, who also represents Calce, suggests that the
                father's strong words on the telephone were simply
                misinterpreted.
                Calce says the dispute involved about $1.5 million but adds
                that he never intended to hurt anyone.
                ''It was the worst possible thing that could happen,'' Calce
                says of the police raid at his suburban home. ''I came
                downstairs in my bathrobe, and there were about 20 Mounties
                in my house. One guy grabbed me by the robe; I told him to
                get his hands off. I'm not an easy guy to push around.''
                There is no disputing that.
                Calce's chalk-stripe suit doesn't hide his formidable size and
                raw manner. Unshaven and blunt-speaking, Calce's physical
                presence, plus the charge lodged against him, seems to invite
                questions about whether there is any special significance
to his
                son's Internet moniker.
                Calce and his lawyer consider the question, share a chuckle
                and then politely decline to respond.
                ''I don't think we'll comment on that one,'' Romanowski says.
                Patrick Healy, a law professor at McGill University in
                Montreal, says a trial in the Mafiaboy case almost certainly
                would provide a unique forum to contest privacy issues and
                sabotage in the computer world.
                ''There have not been many prosecutions of this kind
                anywhere,'' he says.
                And if there is an advantage to taking this case to trial, the
                professor says, it might be tied directly to the
defendant's age.
                ''A trial just might show this boy to be a clever kid who
                should not be hit with a ton of bricks,'' Healy says.
                Computer security analyst Marc Rasch says prosecutors
                should not be intimidated by Romanowski's threat to expose
                potentially damaging hacking information. In this case, he
                says, the type of assault already has been fairly well
                in media accounts of the charges lodged against the boy.
                ''There is genuine risk that publication (of this formula)
                could cause additional exploitation,'' Rasch says, ''but that
                shouldn't dictate how the prosecution should proceed.''
                Miville-Deschenes, the prosecutor, does not appear to be
                fazed by the prospect of courtroom disclosure of sensitive
                information.
                However, he is concerned about the potential cost of a
                lengthy trial and the presentation of complex evidence to a
                judge whose computer savvy might be limited.                 ''I understand that there may be a certain Robin Hood-type
                aspect to this case'' that could foster sympathy for the
                defendant, the prosecutor says. ''This was a kid who was able
                to bring huge dot-com companies to their knees. . . . If he
                were an arsonist, people would want to stone him because of
                the damage he caused. The intent in this case and the damage
                caused is basically the same.''
                If the hacking case goes to trial, Calce says, the defense
                make no attempt to portray his son as a perfect kid.
                In addition to his arrest last Friday, the teen spent two
days in
                detention last July for associating with two boys he was
                prohibited from seeing while the charges are pending.
                Romanowski says his client was merely attempting to avoid
                the two friends when police swooped in.
                ''The kid is definitely feeling the pressure,'' Romanowski
                ''He doesn't find it funny. He has found out that the margin
                for error in his life right now is not what it used to be.
                are a lot of people out there just waiting for him to slip
up.''

Yes, this was brought up recently when I mentioned common carrier
protections  for financial service providers, like the Texans.  It should
be possible to separate the non-responsibility-for-content from the
*eminent-domain-derived* regulation of the copper-wire-plant monopoly.
For instance, a contract printer is not (or should not be) held responsible
for the content he prints, though his rates aren't regulated, because he
doesn't use the "commons".
You *do* want legal recognition of immunity for what clients use your
service for, like a common carrier but without the FCC or PUC.  Thanks for
out that "common carrier" is a tainted/burdened legal term.

I don't see any way around the fact that some companies will want to have
key escrow of some form for employees who disappear, e.g., car accident,
pickpocket stole the key-carrier, etc.  I think companies will want this
because of the risks of financial damage to the company.
Although its hazardous if done wrong [cf recent PGP problems], is
tarnished by the Fedz/Denning/etc, and might have no use in a personal
privacy tool (your diary dies with you), isn't it too dogmatic to rule out
key escrow for tools intended for use by groups? Are there equivalent methods which don't use escrowed keys, which I
am unaware of?  Strong crypto means the employee can put an invincible lock on the
corporate file cabinet.   This might mean that invincible locks are
not used in corporations.  A corporation might require that any
invincible physical locks be used in series, so the corp can get into the
files if the first lock stays locked.  That doesn't seem wrong
to me; and in meatspace two locks in series is obvious and no compromise
is made to either lock's design.
Maybe no escrow per se, but corp. data is duplicated and each copy is
encrypted by a person's bizkey and the corporate shared key for that person.
Locks in series.
(Now, it may be 'sad' that ZKS has changed its bizmodel to service
businesses that need locks in series, but I'm only interested in
whether its rational to universally denounce any locks-in-series
Though this was elaborated on in a later reply, they really do need to

But still, I think that the vast majority of users will end up

utility to the deployees.  Either AMEX is going to pay for all these

to pay because its worth it to them.  With the current $50 credit card fraud limit
on the customers' side, and the generally reliable POTS dial up to the

them. Rational drivers will buy (initially) more expensive but efficient
hybrids if and only if (when) the price of petrol goes up enough to make it
worthwhile.  Ergo, If people were responsible for much more fraud-debt,
they might accept / pay for / require more secure tech.  Economics is physics.
These are testable hypotheses; look to expensive-petrol places (Euro) to buy into high-milage hybrids faster, and 12-cylinder Caddys to be

These are engineering problems, and I'll handwave the term "distributed"
for now.
When I wrote "truly anonymous" I meant those systems where no one's
ass is endangered.  If there's an ass to fry its not anonymous.
Sure, it would be entirely limited by cost, as is everything traded in such a
future. I think the argument is that anyone who pissed off a lot of people
would be culled more quickly than others, and civil servants tend to be in
that category.
For instance, an obnoxious neighbor offends a dozen people.  A politician
who passes laws restricting freedom offends many orders of magnitude more.
Assassination won't get cheaper because the detection hazards remain in an
AP future.
They go into politics, which Mr. Bell has addressed.
Nice Gibson effect there.  There's a bit of a problem with obvious motive, that mass-offenders don't
present.  In fact, since AP says that everyone will have 'means'
and 'opportunity' the only barrier is sufficient motivation.  One could
fear that motivation alone might be enough to convict in future courts.
You know, a number of Intel engineers die, and AMD execs are
nearly-automatically jailed.
Still, AP is an observation about what is possible.  It doesn't have
to be pleasant.  You could say the same about gunpowder or Napster... or any tech
whose components appear in the memepool at the same time.. yielding ideas
which *will* be used, *orthogonal* to whether they are *good* or *fair*..
Alfred Nobel spent the rest of his life getting over his guilt about
stabilizing nitro. He shouldn't have.  Realizing that something is possible

            harassment and intimidation" policy the school district
            had adopted after incidents of racial tension in 1995.
            The policy banned, among other things, students from
            possessing "any written material, either printed or in
            their own handwriting, that is racially divisive or creates
            ill will or hatred."             Confederate flags were specifically listed as such
            material.             During the racial tensions at Derby High School and the
            middle school in 1995, at least one fight had broken out
            as a result of a student wearing a Confederate flag
            headband.             During that time, the Aryan Nation held a recruiting drive
            directly across the street from Derby High School and
            the Ku Klux Klan distributed literature to students near
            the high school.             West and his father challenged the boy's suspension
            from school, but a federal trial judge and the 10th U.S.
            Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the school district.             The appeals court, in its ruling last March, noted that
            West had been suspended earlier that school year for
            calling another student "blackie" and had been
            reminded at that time about the harassment and
            intimidation policy.             The case is West v. Derby Unified School District No.

Oct 2, 2000 - 10:31 AM             Supreme Court Sidesteps
            PlayStation Dispute             By Laurie Asseo
            Associated Press Writer
            WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court stayed out of
            a dispute between Sony and another company whose
            software allows people to run Sony PlayStation games
            on personal computers.             The court, without comment Monday, let Connectix
            continue selling its Virtual Game Station until a lower
            court rules on Sony's claim of unfair competition.             Sony has sold 50 million PlayStations - small computers
            with hand controls - that plug into a television set and
            allow consumers to play games inserted into the
            computer on a compact disc. The PlayStation's
            software program is protected by copyright.             In January 1999, Connectix of San Mateo, Calif., began
            selling the Virtual Game Station, which allows people to
            run PlayStation games on their own personal
            computers.             The Virtual Game Station software does not contain any
            of Sony's copyright material. But in developing it,
            Connectix used the PlayStation's software program by
            extracting its code from a chip and copying it repeatedly
            on its own computer to see how it worked.             Sony filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit, and a
            federal judge in San Francisco halted sales of the
            Virtual Game Station in April 1999 pending a ruling.             The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted that order
            last February, saying Connectix's action amounted to a
            "fair use" of Sony's software.             The court said Connectix was a "legitimate competitor"
            in creating computer platforms on which Sony games
            can be played, adding that copyright law does not allow
            Sony to monopolize that market.             In the appeal acted on Monday, Sony's lawyers said the
            ruling erodes copyright protection for computer
            programs.             Connectix's actions were "pure free-riding, using the
            protected work to develop a substitute far more quickly
            and inexpensively than the original," Sony's lawyers
            said. Sony invested three years and $500 million to
            develop the PlayStation, its lawyers said, while
            Connectix took six months and $150,000 to create its
            product.             Connectix's lawyers said the company created "an
            entirely new environment" for playing PlayStation
            games. A 1998 federal law boosting copyright
            protections for the computer industry endorsed the
            process used by Connectix, the lawyers said.             In May, a federal judge in San Francisco threw out
            seven of Sony's nine allegations against Connectix in
            the copyright case, allowing Sony to pursue claims of
            violating trade secrets and unfair competition.             The case is Sony Computer Entertainment v. Connectix,
            00-11. "The electron, in my judgment, is the ultimate precision-guided munition."

        MIAMI (AP) -- In a ruling that challenges online
        anonymity, a Florida appeals court declared Monday
        that Internet service providers must divulge the
        identities of people who post defamatory messages on
        the Internet.
        Critics of the ruling say it could have a chilling effect
        on free expression in Internet chat rooms.
        The ruling comes against the efforts of the American
        Civil Liberties Union to protect the identity of eight
        individuals who posted anonymous missives on a
        Yahoo! financial chat room about Erik Hvide, the
        former CEO of Hvide Marine Inc.
        Hvide alleges that personal attacks against him also
        caused damage to the company's image.
        Hvide's attorney Bruce Fischman hailed the ruling,
        saying it would force Internet users to ``think a bit
        before they speak.''
        The ACLU had wanted the court first to rule on whether
        Hyde had actually been defamed before identifying the
        defendants, named in court papers only as John Doe. If
        there was no showing of defamation, the ACLU
        reasoned, the critics should remain anonymous.
        However, on Thursday, the court dissolved a stay
        freezing subpoenas for the records of Yahoo! Inc. and
        America Online Inc., whose service was used by one of
        the defendants in the defamation case.
        Lauren Gelman, public policy director with the
        Electronic Frontier Foundation, is concerned that other
        courts could follow the lead of the 3rd District Court of
        Appeals in approving subpoenas.
        ``This kind of speech happens all the time in all kinds
        of chat rooms,'' Gelman said. ``We don't want to see
        these subpoenas become regularly used to cause people
        to self-censor themselves.''
        Both Internet companies took a back seat in the lawsuit,
        saying they would do whatever the judges said.
        Lyrissa Lidsky, who argued the case on behalf of the
        ACLU, called the decision a surprise and a setback.
        Nevertheless, she said, ``It's not a defeat for all the
        other John Does in the pipeline'' fighting
        Internet-related subpoenas because the court did not
        explain its legal reasoning.
        An appeal is being explored.
        ``The court had the potential to set an important
        precedent about the right to speak anonymously on the
        Internet,'' Lidsky said. ``The courts are eventually going
        to have to come to grips with this issue and decide how
        broad free speech rights are in cyberspace.''
        The issue is largely untested in the nation's courts.
        A Virginia federal judge sided with a government
        subpoena request in a criminal case, but civil suits in
        California and Virginia have not settled the subpoena
        questions involving anonymous Internet users.

it was recreational.  She should be suing their asses off

Good point.  Perhaps 'fraud by impersonation' is better.
I suppose a chick with a sullied reputation has to go to a different social
clique where they haven't heard of her, won't recognize her, and don't
communicate with the clique that implements the first reputation.  You'll
note I've phrased it so that the reputation is *distributed* amongst the
former clique, which I think is your point: reputation (and the
polymoderators thereof) is a private, nongovernmental matter.  If you want
to believe the council of rabbis or the better business bureau or the
FTC its your choice.
Of course, the maligned chick should have been using crypto to protect
herself.  Still, I'm aware of no protocol that will prevent malicious
collaborators from claiming wrong things about her, e.g., if they restrict
their libel to her and otherwise maintain trustworthy.  PK sigs don't help.
ALSO, infosec is a *system* property, and you may have to trust others
that you don't control.  E.G., your (nominally private and typically
authenticating) SSID was leaked to the public; this could be used
to harass you.  Similarly with digitized fingerprints that the DMV owns a
copy of, etc.  Which reminds me that you can't change those; meatspace
'identity' has a problem in that fingers will be used as authenticators, so
meat-identity can't be as... parallel... as fully informational identities,
like nyms.
Anyway, I don't think I ever claimed I "owned" my reputation (in the
sense of being able to get the govt to coerce you to act that way).  But I
am bound to (I was going to write, "own") my 'responsibility to creditors',
abuse of which by forging my meatspace-id is fraud, which the govt
is reasonable in using violence to prevent.  I suspect that you regard
such impersonation-fraud as theft, as I do.  I suspect we also both
regard any violence-based (ie, govt) rules wrt linking meat to
bits as unconstitional limits on freedom of speech.  Both points
need to be communicated to Joe Sixpack, Joeseph Merlot, and Johannes
Bourbon III.

A govt has an obligation to secure the data it has collected and not to share it.  So perhaps we agree on this point: the
govt must not give out (do 'dirty work') data on citizens that it holds.
If an insurance (or bank or grocery or whatever) co. wants data, they can't
expect it from the govt.

No subtlety, just an observation that non-techies found it much
easier to use the protocol since it came 'bundled'.  Imagine
all the online hausfrau trying to install a packet driver, shims, debugging it... My point is that MS made Netscape's life easier by having a stack already
deployed.  And clearly Netscape made the that stack (and the computer) more
useful, at least easier to use.
And clearly the NSF giving up control allowed the current mess.
I'm well aware of the dangers of saying anything positive about
MS in a public forum.  Maybe they'll be charged under antitrust law
by all those stack-vendors who went belly-up when MS bundled extra functionality into the OS.  Just like when Weitek sues
Intel for bundling their FP biz into Intel's CPUs.

There was a desire to see what was sufficient to generate photorealism.
After all, the shading models you mention are crude approximations; but
they usually work[1], which talks to the limits of perception.  And
to a nontrivial physics of a certain scale (modelling translucent
objects, objects with embedded reflectors and adsorbers, etc.)
There was also a desire to understand the rendering process so that
you could understand the *inverse*, ie, inferring the world from

movies around a single new model (particle systems in that terraforming
star trek movie).  The question that motivates was, how do you do that?
Where 'that' might be rendering hair, or modelling how skin creases at elbows.
I modelled wood grain with a VAX in 1985 using a 24 bit monitor that cost more than some cars.  Nowadays you would just scan and
texture map real wood, but the (psychophysical) question was,
what did you need to model to get grain indistinguishable from real[2]? Texture mapping is cheating.
Similar questions exist for modelling motion.  How many harmonics
do you need to render for realistic motion?  How do you make a desklamp move with emotion?  (Luxo Jr..)  (Recording actors and
mapping movement is cheating, Mr. Spielberg.)  These folks had a more academic interest than you make out.. Blinn wrote a

Yep.  And any parent who relies on v-chips is *abdicating responsibility*
by depending on someone else's ratings.  Similarly with internet
content ratings or MPAA filtering (PG vs R) or FCC filtering (content vs.
broadcast time, or their stupid labels on broadcasts).
To Bear: my reference top "machines under others' control" means
censorware which hides its list of sites from parents.
Certainly relying on other editors (filters) is useful, but parents have to
pick the editors carefully.  This is not a political but a personal
responsability issue; as far as the state goes, no filtering can be
*imposed* by others in a free society.  My point was that a parent
voluntarily chosing some black-box default is not doing their job.  \begin{political} A parent forced to use filtered feeds needs to eliminate that force, then that imposed filter.
Anyone can open up a ratings system and filtering tools.
And they are free to have open or secret lists and rules.  You
are free to pick and choose raters you like ---just like you can
chose to eat kosher-rated, or 'organic'-rated, or whatever. But the filters can have no support from the State, for that is censorship.
Freedom + filters = lame parenting; State + filters = censorship.

Germany Reportedly Plans 'Internet
     Tax'      BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is planning to slap new
     levies on computer, telecommunications and Internet
     products to ensure that authors are properly rewarded for
     the use of their work, a newspaper said Wednesday.
     The Berliner Zeitung said proposals had been drafted requiring
manufacturers of
     goods from computers to printers, modems, compact disc ``burners'' and
     devices to pay royalty fees that would then be forwarded to music and
     companies.
     Officials at the Justice Ministry, which it said was behind the move,
were not
     immediately available for comment.
     The new tax would particularly intend to ensure that the authors of
cultural products
     available on the Internet were properly rewarded.
     Similar levies already exist in Germany on devices whose main function
is that of
     copying, such as scanners, photocopiers and fax machines. Depending on
the power
     of the machine involved, the taxes range from $30-$275.
     The levies are paid by manufacturers to firms that specialize in
collecting royalties
     on so-called ``intellectual property.'' They then pass these fees on
to clients such as
     authors, music, film or software companies.
     Hardware companies say extending the taxes to computers and telecom
     like modems could make them up to 30 percent more expensive.
     Because the taxes are only payable when the products are bought in
Germany, there
     have been warnings they could lead hi-tech firms to flee the country
and sell through
     mail order and other channels from abroad.

                   By JOHN KAY                    THE Sun has been handed a copy of a
                   red-hot book of spy secrets written by
                   the former head of MI5.                    The manuscript by Dame Stella
                   Rimington is now being vetted by
                   security chiefs to decide if it can be

                   detail about Dame Stella's career -
                   especially her four years as MI5 boss.
                   We spent weeks checking the facts in
                   the book to establish it was not a
                   hoax. The manuscript is safely locked
                   in The Sun's safe.                    Then we contacted Downing Street
                   chiefs to arrange for the red-hot
                   document to be collected.                    We decided it was not in the national

                   more sensitive contents.                    But we CAN disclose that it touches

                   Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.                    The book - which is packed with
                   detail about Dame Stella's 29-year
                   career in the secret service - came
                   into our hands anonymously.                    And one theory was that a
                   disgruntled spook at MI5's rival
                   organisation MI6 arranged for the
                   copy to be delivered to us in a bid to
                   sabotage publication.                    The Sun exclusively revealed last May
                   that 65-year-old Dame Stella - given
                   her title in the 1996 New Year's
                   Honours - had written her memoirs.                    She submitted a draft to the

                   to publish, which has not yet been

                   Secretary Sir Richard Wilson, all
                   wanted the book banned.                    Some senior MI6 officers were so

                   want to be a spy?"                    It discloses how she rapidly worked
                   her way up the ladder in a profession
                   dominated by men.                    The book is dotted with humorous
                   anecdotes including her dealings with
                   ex-PMs Maggie Thatcher and John
                   Major.                    There is also much detail about the
                   "methodology" of MI5 - especially
                   over counter-espionage and the war
                   against the IRA.                    Dame Stella, who is immensely proud
                   to have been Britain's first female
                   spymaster, claims credit for
                   overseeing a large increase in the
                   number of women spooks.                    Security chiefs want to stop
                   publication because they fear
                   information being given to Britain's
                   enemies - and to avoid being accused
                   of double standards.                    The Government went to great
                   lengths to try to ban the Spycatcher
                   memoirs of former MI5 bugging
                   expert Peter Wright.                    Ex-MI5 officer David Shayler has
                   returned to Britain to face charges
                   under the Official Secrets Act for
                   writing about the secret service.                    And ex-MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson
                   was jailed for trying to publish his
                   autobiography.                       Shock ... Sun story last May                    A senior government security source
                   said: "This is what is so appalling. It
                   is not so much the content, it is the
                   principle of her writing it which is all
                   so wrong.                    "She should just keep quiet and enjoy
                   her sizeable pension and income from
                   directorships.                    "By writing her book she is only
                   encouraging other spies to start
                   penning their own memoirs." Copies
                   of the manuscript are understood to
                   have been circulated to MI5, MI6,
                   Special Branch, senior civil servants
                   and government ministers.                    Another security source said: "The
                   book does contain sensitive
                   information but there is no question
                   of Dame Stella naming any of our
                   agents. The biggest fear is that it will
                   open the floodgates."                    Leading security expert Chris Dobson,
                   who has written 15 books on spies
                   and terrorists, said: "I congratulate
                   The Sun for acting in a highly
                   responsible manner.                    "It is essential that this book never

                   one anecdote from Dame Stella's
                   book - because we don't believe it
                   breaches ANY official secrets.                    After becoming director general of
                   MI5 in 1992, her home was besieged
                   by journalists and she moved her two
                   daughters and their pet dog into an
                   apartment on the top floor of the spy
                   network's central London HQ.                    The hound was issued with his own

Sure.  Its not censorship (yet).
But what kind of environment suffers a publisher who won't publish? Information is leaked, at some risk, so that it can be broadcast.
Sure, this is a private action, but when someone gives you a treasure
you don't hide from it.  You don't ask the queen how far to bend over.

Basically next year you could get a motherboard with a security module

The last EETimes-print-edition had an article with *much* more info but I
found the following online.  You can comment on the stuff until October, on their site; they have whitepapers.  Coprocessors Move
              Security Onto PC
              Motherboards
              (09/05/00, 6:51 p.m. ET) By Junko Yoshida , EE Times               SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Responding to
              industry demand for better built-in
              security, vendors of PC chips and
              smart-card ICs are racing to develop
              security coprocessors that mount on a PC
              motherboard.               Architectural approaches vary, but
              suppliers agree that this new design socket
              will start showing up in motherboards as
              early as the middle of next year.               Integrating a security chip makes it
              possible "to view the PC as an endpoint
              for the delivery of goods and services" in
              the digital economy, said Geoffrey
              Strongin, platform security architect at
              Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (stock:
              AMD), Sunnyvale, Calif.               AMD is one of the PC chip makers
              readying a security device.               The trend is to move "core security and
              e-commerce functions out to the edge of
              the Internet, and place them in all endpoint
              devices including the user's PC,"
              concurred Steven Sprague, president and
              chief executive officer at Wave Systems
              Corp. (stock: WAVX), Lee, Mass., which
              fields the Embassy security chip and is
              working with AMD on a reference design.
              Promoters say that while much effort has
              gone into securing the network and the
              server-side infrastructure, until very
              recently the client has been overlooked.
              Thanks to advances in SSL software
              technology, the transmission of data
              across the Internet is more secure than
              ever.               But "vulnerability often exists at the PC
              and at the server," said Cees Jan Koomen,
              chairman of the board at security-chip
              vendor Pijnenburg Securealink, Vught,
              Netherlands, which is also developing a
              coprocessor.               "You need a cryptographic solution in
              hardware, placed at the server and PC
              terminal," he said. That way, "critical
              information, such as a key, is not available
              except inside the chip, while the hardware
              can accelerate the transaction speed."               Driving the security-coprocessor
              groundswell is an emerging specification
              being put together by the Trusted
              Computing Platform Alliance, an industry
              group founded by Compaq Computer
              Corp. (stock: CPQ), Houston;
              Hewlett-Packard Co. (stock: HWP), Palo
              Alto, Calif.; IBM Corp. (stock: IBM);
              Intel Corp. (stock: INTC), Santa Clara,
              Calif.; and Microsoft Corp. (stock:

Then why do people pay?  Ultimately law is backed by violence.
Having, say, your restaurant license revoked by a bureaucrat in
an agency created by a committe empowered by elected officials does
not change the fact that Folks With Guns will haul you and your property
away if you operate without their permission.  You "don't go to jail for not paying GEMA" but you do go to jail
for not paying fines for not paying GEMA, not showing up in court, etc.  Don't pretend.

during the

                                          lunch, stand on chairs with that
                                          wiggle in his knees, fuss with
his shirt
                                          buttons. Sometimes, when the
                                          notices the camera in his
day-care center,
                                          he waves.                                                All day she watches.                                                Chase, 5, was attending

                                          launched in early 1997 at a day-care
                                          center in Connecticut. Also in 1997,
                                          Cathy's Kids Club in Tustin
                                          video cameras in classrooms to
                                          still pictures on the Internet
for parents to
                                          monitor their children. That
system is still
                                          in place, an employee there said.                                                Still, concerns have been
raised about
                                          such systems, by teachers and
                                          who question just how much parents
                                          should be overseeing their
children during
                                          the school day. And some
                                          commentators have huffed that if
                                          want to watch their children so
badly, they
                                          should stay at home with them.                                                But Lovely says she has not
heard any
                                          such complaints.                                                "This is just a sign that
people are
                                          saying, 'Yes, I have to work,'
but they are
                                          finding other ways to connect
with their
                                          families," she said. "This is one
way of
                                          doing it that works. . . . I know
it is
                                          one-way communication, but it is
                                          something."                                                Lovely said some schools were
                                          apprehensive, especially about the
                                          requirement that all parents
participate in
                                          the program; that adds cost to
                                          expensive day-care fees. But other
                                          schools were eager to join in,
                                          another opportunity to allay
                                          about safety in child-care centers,
                                          particularly after the Costa Mesa
crash.                                                "There's this fear out
there," said
                                          Jamee Backus, director of Newport
                                          Harbor Montessori Center, which
                                          for about 160 children. "I feel
like this
                                          abolishes all that fear. Parents
can log on.
                                          Then they can ask their children
                                          their day. The parents know what
to ask.
                                          Like, 'Hey, I saw you were
working on a
                                          science project. . . .' And the
children feel
                                          more connected with their
parents. You
                                          can feel it in them. You can see
it when
                                          they wave into the cameras. It is
darling."                                                Sometimes the video can be
                                          however; the quality of the
images can be
                                          uneven and jerky. The video produces
                                          seven frames per second, compared
                                          about 30 for television. The
video offers
                                          detail and color, but no sound.                                                But even if technology
doesn't allow
                                          for perfect, real-time video yet,
                                          participating parents and schools
say the
                                          idea offers a sense of security.                                                "For the parent it shows we
                                          nothing to hide," Backus said,
"and they
                                          don't have to come and check on
                                          child."                                                Backus said about two dozen
                                          enrolled in the school
specifically for the
                                          cameras, and about a third of
them were
                                          single parents looking for some
way to
                                          stay in touch with their children.                                                One 31-year-old mother sends
                                          child to a preschool in the
county that uses
                                          the cameras. She did not want her
                                          used because of concerns about her
                                          4-year-old daughter's safety.                                                She said the cameras were
the biggest
                                          selling point for her school.                                                "It just makes sense," she
                                          "There's a lot to worry about. I

done. I
                                          also can call her on it when she
puts her
                                          feet on the table. She's not
supposed to put

"Fairness vs Reason in the Ultimatum Game"
Nowak, Page, Sigmund
(from the abstract) "The rational solution, suggested by game theory, is
for the proposer to offer the smallest possible share
and for teh responder to accept it.  If humans play
the game, however, the most frequent outcome is a fair
share.  In this paper, we develop an evolutionary
approach to the Ultimatum Game.  We show that fairness
will evolve if the proposer can obtain some information
on what deals the responder has accepted in the past.
Hence, the evolution of fairness, similarly to the
evolution of cooperation, is linked to reputation"
In the ultimatum game, two players are offered a chance
to win a certain sum of money.  All they must do is divide
it. ...if the responder rejects the deal, both get nothing.

Friday September 22 1:38 PM ET
     U.S. Leads Global Snooping Drive -
     Report      By Jim Wolf
     WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has led a
     worldwide drive to build the groundwork for expanded
     snooping in the digital era, two civil rights groups alleged
     in a new survey.
     The Electronic Privacy Information Center and Privacy
     International highlighted what they called a push led by the
     U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation toward
     wiretap-friendly international communications standards.
     Washington also has sought to curb the development and
     sale of hardware and software featuring strong encryption,
     the communications-scrambling know how aimed at
     securing data from prying eyes, the survey said.
     ``The U.S. government has led a worldwide effort to limit
     individual privacy and enhance the capability of its police
     and intelligence services to eavesdrop on personal
     conversations,'' the report, ``Privacy & Human Rights
     2000,'' said.
     The survey, to be released next week at a privacy
     conference in Venice, Italy, said FBI (news - web sites)
     Director Louis Freeh had nudged countries such as
     Hungary and the Czech Republic to expand wiretapping.
     FBI spokesman Steven Berry said the bureau was
     reserving comment on the report. In the early 1990s, it
     spearheaded what became the 1994 Communications
     Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which
     requires telecommunications equipment makers to leave
     their gear open to wiretaps.
     U.S. authorities argued they needed such a law to keep up
     with criminals using sophisticated technology to dodge
     court-authorized surveillance.
     ``When the FBI was lobbying for CALEA in the United
     States, it also began working with the Justice and Interior
     ministers of the European Union toward creating
     international technical standards for wiretapping,'' the
     report said.
     It also cited the FBI's recently disclosed ``Carnivore''
     e-mail surveillance system, used with court orders to scan
     an Internet service provider's traffic for communications to
     and from a criminal suspect.
     Quoting unnamed Russian computer security experts, the
     report said U.S. officials had advised Moscow on
     implementation of such network surveillance systems.
     Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, in turn, had proposed
     requiring Internet service providers to install surveillance
     devices based on a Russian system, the report said.
     David Banisar, a Washington lawyer who is chief author
     of the survey, said the United States had pressed Japan to
     adopt its first laws allowing wiretapping. In addition, it
     had been promoting surveillance through the G-7 group of
     the largest industrialized nations plus Russia, the report
     said.
     Banisar, in a telephone interview, said one result of U.S.
     policy had been to make it easier for repressive countries
     to maintain control over their citizens.
     ``And it also increases the amount of illegal wiretapping

When you say 'accused of fascism' you mean accused of nationalist-rascism,
no?  Fascism really means state-control of everything, and its only because of National Socialism of the 30-40s' quirks that they are linked in

The US, has been in the 20th century quite fascist in its control of all
property and too sensitive (infringing on rights with social engineering)

In the US, those rules include tolerance for ideas (that if carried
out would be infringements of others rights to be left alone).  Of course there are social rules.  Within the boundaries of no-nonconsensual-harm (ie, others' right to be left alone), you're free to
do whatever, no matter how distasteful to others.
Let's face it: Society

Yes but many potential users of crypto will not put up with too many
extra actions, e.g., going to a command prompt, running pgp, opening the
ciphered file, cutting and pasting.  You can argue that, e.g., they should
all be shot :-), but isn't the goal to get more traffic (even uninteresting
traffic) encrypted? Modularity *is* useful for keeping things simple enough to analyze, but
isn't a library with a well-defined API sufficient?  [If your OS supports it, there might be slightly more decoupled ways (vs. linking) to talk to the
crypto process, e.g., pipes, clipboards, rpc.  Is this more in line with what
you're thinking?]
How would you modularize SSL?  Distribute a proxylike program that an app
talks to when it wants to go secure?   How do you modularize PGPfone?
Even in a bloated integrated app, clean modular design can keep the analysis tractable.  If the app talks to the crypto module, you'll likely
have to trust the app whether the crypto is linked-in or whether it is an

One very common security model is that the security perimeter includes
the PC and you're only concerned with transmission interception.  MS is swiss cheese but most OS have some weakness in many configs.
How many people actually look at the source of the code they
install on *nix machines???  How many of those who do are actually qualified
to do security reviews?  Cf. recent PGP bugs.
If you're really worried you'd use a sealed PDA (that you can control at
all times) to capture/render and the PC is just for transport.  [This
applies Tim's modularity argument to hardware.]
I'd consider a Starium unit a dedicated PDA in this context.

          "Home schooling is a social threat to public education," says
          Chris Lubienski, who teaches at Iowa State University's

          parents who know how to get things done with
          administrators."

Yes, a good psyop operation can deny negative information,

I suggest recognizing the distinction between controlling
info and slant (psyops and Dan Rather and Turner and Murdoch, I don't actually follow that stuff) and controlling
reps which can't be done directly (but which can be measured).  The fact that info & slant *can* influence distributed reps is why psyops
folks have jobs.
Finally the reps which can (or can't) be bought and sold (the

Orange County is taking what some civil libertarians consider troubling steps to keep tabs on released sex offenders, giving them periodic lie detector tests and, starting next year, requiring some to wear wristbands linked to satellite tracking systems.
The county will become the first in the state, and one of only a dozen or so nationwide, to track sex offenders on parole and probation with global positioning satellites, which allow officials to pinpoint offenders' locations around the clock.

Using the search mechanisms, you can find groups in a genre you are
interested in.
For instance, 'industrial' will find files whose names include that label.
An interesting problem for Napster et al: if they have to control the indexing
of files that are claimed by Content Corporations, they can't just use the
name of a band.  Because you can label your own, public-domain music with
"proprietary" labels, e.g., "Joe's Band ---better than Metallica"   (Also
many files
are 'covers' of other songs.)  And watermarking the files won't work.  So implementing the control that the courts will require, without being

assuring that rot13 or DES isn't used. Though its more work for Mr. SMTP

A general and reliable heuristic is to measure entropy.  This will of course

additional (and perhaps

Interestingly, copyright and patent differ on 'unknowingly taking'.
If (as was recently mentioned) someone dupes some content and gives

not you.  The copier could 'unknowingly take' by simply mistaking the
content for public domain.
But patents are different.  If sell you a chip, and you build a board with
it, and Joe build a system with your board, and that chip turns out to be
infringing a patent, my chip, your board, Joe's system, everything that
uses the infringing work is legal toast.  (And could be stopped at the

I've found the following two books to be good reading and
even appropriate to this list: The Irish War, Tony Geraghty (c) 2000;
and The Story of Magic by Frank Rowlett (c) 1998.  _Magic_ is about the career of a high school math teacher who
got into crypto under Friedman, before computers.  He eventually used them,
and there is much discussion about hilariously archaic IBM equiptment,
tabulator plugboards, relay circuit design, a whole chapter devoted to
building a device that performed autoindexed addressing (without the IBM
dudes knowing about it... you're not supposed to hack on the rented stuff..)
They were tossing hollerith cards in front of fans to generate
randomness.  They end up reverse engineering and duplicating a Japanese
cipher machine without plans. The book, written from Rowlett's perspective, reads pretty well, better than Kahn.  Rowlett describes some of the methods of attack, both
pencil and paper and punched-cards; the punch card operations & recipes are
fascinating to read about and try to figure out the modern equivalent.
It is hard to imagine the tedium that was involved in old cryptanalysis.
Obviously you get more out of the book the more you can relate to
the problems he faced -perfect for readers here.  _Irish War_ is about the past and present north irish independence movement.  Its pretty fascinating reading about how the IRA and
British continually refined their practices and tools.  There's some
tech meat about surveillance, running a network, and homemade
military tech.  The IRA had metalshops to make their own weapons and
propellants and explosives, and had made their own recoilless rocket and HEAT warheads.  You get the same sense of intricately fucked historical
hatreds that you do if you read a brief history of yugoslavia.
You learn that the Brit SS set up a clothing cleaning service (p 90)
and ran forensic analysis on the collected clothes before cleaning.
Shades of the FBI's covert house cleaning service...or Boris's computer
repair shop.  As a result of the War, North Ireland is set up like a demo room

filled with useless noise.  There is a patent on thermite-like pastes you can build into a chip, which

simple zeroizing will probably be enough; though see the work on remenance

[1] For instance, the DB could be the list of members, the
action could be to add or drop a member.
Also, some group actions might compromise the DB itself, and so it seems to
me that you'd often need a trusted server which accepts

No.  No more than your choice of reading materials is censorship.
If I chose not to publish or buy text-X its not censorship.
If the government interferes, it is.
Now if I choose a spawning mate based on their apparent fitness
(as judged by me), this is personal 'eugenics', and its fine morally.
(Similarly with those who voluntarily delegate the choice to
family members.)
Now if the State does the choosing, its coercion by the state, which
was pretty tainted by the German Socialists a generation or two
ago, regardless of the possible future benefits, even if 'fitness' is agreed upon by all.  Regardless of the benefits, its coercion.
Private choice vs. Coercion by the State.  Simple.  Not all
choice is censorship, or bad eugenics.
Aside: When the State enslaves 'fit' citizens as soldiers, some fraction of
which are taken out of the gene pool, an indirect form of eugenics
(animal husbandry) is taking place.  Selection against 1As
and carriers of patriotism traits, for instance.

Friday July 13 6:33 AM ET   Anti-Tax Protests at Tenn. Capitol
  By KARIN MILLER, Associated Press Writer   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Protesters hurled rocks through Capitol
  windows, chanted ``no new tax!'' and banged on the locked doors of
  the Senate chamber where Tennessee lawmakers were debating the
  creation of a state income tax.
  The tax plan had died before the protesters arrived Thursday, but when
  word spread that lawmakers had passed a no-tax budget, cheers went
  up among the hundreds of protesters.
  ``The people are passionate when they say, 'no income tax','' said
  Steve Gill, a Nashville radio talk show host who had called on tax
  opponents to swarm the Capitol.
  Anti-tax protests have been frequent the past three years as lawmakers
  considered implementing a state income tax, but the protests had
  always been peaceful - until Thursday.
  Within hours of hearing that the Legislature was considering a
  last-minute income tax plan, protesters swarmed into the area, honking
  car horns, waving signs reading ``Tax Revolt!'' and bringing traffic
  outside the Capitol to a standstill.
  The rock-throwers busted several windows, including one in the
  governor's office. State troopers escorted lawmakers in the halls and
  locked the doors to the Capitol. One state employee trying to lock a
  side door was injured as the weight of the crowd pushed against him.
  No arrests were made and no other injuries were reported.
  ``I appreciate the right of all Americans to free speech and peaceful
  protest. I do not, however, approve of those who advocate violence
  and I regret that occurred at the Capitol,'' Gov. Don Sundquist said in
  a statement.
  Sundquist has said he would veto any budget that didn't include a new
  revenue plan.
  The budget the Legislature passed doesn't include the 3.5 percent
  income tax lawmakers had discussed. It instead cuts $339 million from
  the governor's $19.9 billion spending plan, requires state agencies to
  save an additional $100 million, and uses $560 million in tobacco
  settlement money - four years worth - to balance the budget.
  Sundquist wouldn't say if he would sign it.
  Tennessee is one of nine states without a broad-based income tax, but
  it has one of the highest sales tax rates at 6 percent, with local
  governments adding up to 2.75 percent.
  Sen. Bob Rochelle, a Democratic proponent of a state income tax, had
  argued that the sales tax could be reduced if an income tax was
  implemented. ``The day will come when we won't mistreat our citizens
  any more with that tax,'' he said.
  Republican Sen. David Fowler, an opponent of the income tax, said
  negotiations had already broken down by the time most of the
  protesters arrived.
  One proposal discussed would have put plans for an income tax to a
  statewide vote. Fowler said the protest may have ``effectively killed''
  that as an option.
  ``I don't know if they knew that's what they were doing, but that's what
  they were doing,'' Fowler said.

to this detection.  I also didn't mention how some stego does not use
raw LSBs but interstitial places in complex encodings (e.g., mp3).  I was
only explaining the principle of how you don't need a 'secret method' to hide
the existence of messages.
Of course not uniformly distributed, you have to cook any source of
noise to distill the pure stuff we covet.
Yes.  And as you point out correctly, doing this requires knowing something

My physics is fine.  I assume the reader can tell that I'm explaining the reason for using *individually lightweight flakes* separately from the trivial symmetric-reaction-mass part of the rifle.
After all, a reader would be asking themselves, why not just use
a slug of the same mass, or even some ball bearings (shot), since he indicates (by saying "equal mass") that this would work?
And I explain the safe dissipation of the flakes' *energy*, not momentum (which as you point out is what matters for the recoilless-ness) because the flakes dissipate their motion as *heat* via  viscous drag through the atmosphere.  Picture yourself using one in cramped quarters.  The chaff 'flying off to

trap for the United States. Al-Qaida retains the
     initiative and the U.S. is operating inside the intentions and plans
of Al-Qaida      Al-Qaida cannot destroy the U.S. forces inside the U.S., nor can it
convince the U.S. to leave the Middle East using
     terror attacks. The intention of the terror attacks is a provocation
to force the U.S. to engage and deploy forces to the
     Middle East, where such forces could be destroyed      The intention and purpose of Al-Qaidas plans are either to make the
Middle East ungovernable, or to gain control of
     the petroleum production system in the region. Application of the oil
weapon could be used to attempt to force
     withdrawal of U.S. presence in the region; outright destruction of the
petroleum production system would leave the U.S.
     with no or greatly reduced real interests in the region      Control or destruction of the petroleum production system in the
Middle East, and the potential for attacks on global

I've wondered about that too; airport sniffers must have encountered
Miracle Gro and angina nitro during the early days, measuring
a false alarm rate.  Shooting is scary; you could contaminate
your car driving back from the range, then contaminate your
travel gear.
The explosives expert in one of the older terror trial docs on cryptome
says things suggesting that a few washes will remove traces.  (And contaminate
clothes washed with them.)
I once checked out the screen on a sniffer, and they list "nitrates"
as a category.  I suppose having PETN (another category) detected on your laptop would be harder to explain :-)

Yes, but what this thread has ignored is that gold (and other

the gold is still worth something.  Similarly with barrels

get wealth because the substance itself has utility.

Hardly dogma; look at history.  Unhindered by social engineers/violence monopolists, people used
tools (capital) to increase productivity.  This had much more
dramatic effects during the industrial period than the preceeding
agricultural one, though nowadays agri shows high productivity
thanks to some sophisticated tools, too.
Unhindered, people use their forebrains and invest in the future.  The
investment might be themselves acquiring a skill, a tool,
or investing in others' activities.  The payoff structure
of the universe encourages this.
If you encourage others to get educated, you are a capitalist.
If you discourage others from investing in themselves or others,
don't try to acquire the right skill or tool to meet your goals, I'd say you weren't a capitalist.  You'll have a hard time doing

I recently posted how ground squirrels have rep cap.
It seemed to be something like hits & false alarm (and probably
misses and correct rejections) counts for squirrels.  The same info is of use to neurons.  Various computer learning algorithms too.
An efficient use of persistant state, one would expect.
Two kinds of entities: one maintains reputations, the other doesn't.
Guess which is exploited to extinction? Again CPunks -or other analysts- are not *advocating* nearly as much as some might like to believe; instead IMHO there is a public discussion
going on about essentially inevitable trends we've observed.

Indeed, even when there are objective measures, all parties
may not agree because they may not agree on those measures.
If Alice Squirrel makes an alarm call and Bob Squirrel sees
a threat, but Charlie Squirrel doesn't see it, Bob and Charlie
will have different stats for Alice's alarm-call reputation.
But rep cap as an idea is surely *stronger* when you keep separate
numbers for different qualities -reliable vs. interesting posts,
for instance.  This is *necessary* since individuals vary greatly
within themselves.  Politicians with excellent reps on issue A
and mediocre reps on issue B, for instance.
Perhaps though authors should mention the *attribute* whose
reputation is estimated when its not obvious.  Similarly authors
should state *who* is doing the estimating when its not clear
its the author.
But what counts as  "good customer service" varies by culture
and person, much like whether WSJ publication helps or hurts.

Aha.  I have learned something then; I didn't realize that reps
must be somewhat infectious.  But infectious-reps require a decent
medium, e.g., a decent language; squirrels don't really have the
degrees of freedom.  Though it must be obvious to new squirrels
(eg by observing other more seasoned squirrels lack of reaction) that no
one takes Spoofie Squirrel seriously.  In any case, each squirrel certainly
believes their own set of experiences (and reputations inferred therefrom)
and so would advocate the adoption of its experience, if sufficiently verbal to do so.  Much like primates.
In any case, "Spoofie is unreliable about badgers" seems to me to be
a reputation.
At one extreme of opinion, reps are personal; at the other they are objective
and are therefore worth transferring amongst members of so-equipt
Nature *does* have joints at which it can be carved; high-rep people
will tend to recommend other high-rep people and the UFO types will
cross reference the Bigfoot folks.  Such is the nature of peer
review, of cultural epistemology.   There are objective
parts of reputation, even if no objective agreement on the *sign* of
the quality.  Crypto/tech will only elaborate what is innate or natural in social critters.

FTC shutters thousands of Web sites      By Reuters      October 1, 2001, 11:40 a.m. PT      WASHINGTON--A U.S. court shut down thousands of Web sites after it
     determined that they diverted Web surfers and held them captive while
     bombarding them with ads for pornography and gambling, the U.S.
     said on Monday.      According to the Federal Trade Commission, John Zuccarini, of
Andalusia, Pa., outside
     Philadelphia, operated more than 5,500 Web sites that diverted Web
surfers from their
     intended destinations and exposed them to pop-up ads.      Zuccarini did not immediately respond to calls for comment.      Zuccarini registered many
     misspellings of popular sites, such
     as Cartoonnetwork.com, the
     FTC said, in a bid to draw traffic
     from sloppy typists. Visitors to
     his sites often could not leave, as
     the "back" button on their Web
     browsers would be rigged to
     trigger more pop-up ads.      "After one FTC staff member
     closed out of 32 separate
     windows, leaving just two
     windows on the task bar, he
     selected the 'back' button, only to
     watch as the same seven windows that initiated the blitz erupted on
his screen, and the
     cybertrap began anew," the FTC said in its complaint, filed in the
U.S. District Court for
     the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.      The scheme is especially harmful to children or employees who may put
their jobs at risk
     when they inadvertently call up pornographic or gambling-related
material, the FTC said.      The district court has ordered Zuccarini to take his sites offline,
the FTC said, while the
     case continues. But as of early Monday afternoon, at least one site
registered to Zuccarini,
     Annakurnikova.com, was still functional.      Zuccarini had registered 41 variations on the name of pop star Britney
Spears, the FTC
     said.      In its court action, the FTC is seeking to get Zuccarini to return the
estimated $800,000 to
     $1 million he earns in advertising revenues.      According to the FTC, Zuccarini has been sued at least 63 times in the
last two years by
     trademark owners, celebrities or others seeking to recover variants of
their Internet domain
     names. He has lost 53 of those suits and been forced to return nearly
200 domain names,
     the FTC said.

@_subject: cats good for allergy -followup references 
In a thread "Re: When the FBI Guys Come Knocking..." I claimed
(from memory) that cats can decrease allergies.  I was unable
to find the _Science_ ref but I
found a few refs to the original research reported in The Lancet 357:752-56 (2001).   Reproduced below.  I don't
make this stuff up.
Contrary to popular belief, high levels of cat allergen in the home can sometimes decrease the risk of a child developing
asthma, says grantee Thomas A. Platts-Mills, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of
Virginia. Apparently, the presence of a cat can alter the immune system in a manner similar to
allergy shots, he reports.
For other allergens that trigger asthma, such as the
dust mite and cockroach, the higher the exposure level, the more likely it is that a child
will produce "allergic" antibodies, called immunoglobulin-E or Ig-E antibodies, against them.
This high exposure increases the child's risk of becoming allergic and developing asthma.
But with cats, high exposure actually can confer
protection -- at least in some children, Dr. Platts-Mills says. He and colleagues measured the
levels of allergic antibodies to cat allergen in 226 children, aged 12 to 14 years, and tested the
children for asthma. They also measured the amount of cat allergen in the children's homes and
discovered that low-to-moderate amounts of cat allergen seemed to trigger allergy, but high
amounts -- greater than 20 micrograms per gram of house dust -- reduced both IgE antibodies and the
likelihood of asthma.
                      "This result alters the advice we give patients,"
says Dr. Platts-Mills. "I would not recommend                       that all parents get rid of their cat because they
are concerned their child might develop asthma.                       High exposure to cat allergen appears to be
protective for some children and a risk factor for                       others. If the child is wheezing and has a positive
skin test to cat allergen, then you should get rid                       of your cat."
                      The high levels of cat allergen prompted the
children's immune systems to make mostly a                       particular subtype of immunoglobulin G (IgG), called
IgG4 antibody, rather than IgE, Dr.                       Platts-Mills explains. Allergy shots are believed to
produce a similar effect. "This research sheds                       more light on the relationship between allergen
exposure and asthma," he says. "When we                       further understand this process, it might lead to new
treatments for asthma."                       Reference: T Platts-Mills et al. Sensitisation,

                       BACKGROUND: Although asthma is strongly associated
with immediate hypersensitivity to
                       indoor allergens, several studies have suggested
that a cat in the house can decrease the risk of
                       asthma. We investigated the immune response to cat
and mite allergens, and asthma among
                       children with a wide range of allergen exposure.
METHODS: We did a population-based
                       cross-sectional study of children (aged 12-14
years), some of whom had symptoms of asthma
                       and bronchial hyper-reactivity. Antibodies to mite
(Der f 1) and cat (Fel d 1) allergens
                       measured by isotype (IgG and IgG4) specific
radioimmunoprecipitation assays were compared
                       with sensitisation and allergen concentrations in
house dust. FINDINGS: 226 children were
                       recruited, 47 of whom had symptoms of asthma and
bronchial hyper-reactivity. Increasing
                       exposure to mite was associated with increased
prevalence of sensitisation and IgG antibody to
                       Der f 1. By contrast, the highest exposure to cat
was associated with decreased sensitisation,
                       but a higher prevalence of IgG antibody to Fel d 1.
Thus, among children with high exposure,
                       the odds of sensitisation to mite rather than cat
was 4.0 (99% CI 1.49-10.00). Furthermore, 31
                       of 76 children with 23 microg Fel d 1 at home, who
were not sensitised to cat allergen had
                       >125 units of IgG antibody to Fel d 1. Antibodies to
Fel d 1 of the IgG4 isotype were strongly
                       correlated with IgG antibody in both allergic and
non-allergic children (r=0.84 and r=0.66,
                       respectively). Sensitisation to mite or cat
allergens was the strongest independent risk factor for
                       asthma (p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Exposure to cat
allergen can produce an IgG and
                       IgG4 antibody response without sensitisation or risk
of asthma. This modified T-helper-2 cell
                       response should be regarded as a form of tolerance
and may be the correct objective of
                       immunotherapy. The results may also explain the
observation that animals in the house can
                       decrease the risk of asthma.

causes injury via inhalation.  VX, being nonvolitile (2 weeks), causes
injury mostly by contact.  The Israelis *also* sealed a room, and would sit in

@_subject: Anthrax...coincidence? 
Channelling TM: why don't you google the topic yourself? Or go to a library, since if you kick the paranoia up a notch
you can't trust the net.
In fact, Anthrax spores are much more useful than say smallpox militarily,
because Anthrax doesn't spread to your homeland.  That's the whole
point.  You have to use spores to infect, but infected people don't
make spores.  Also, once infected, you're toast quickly despite treatment.
But other background info backs this up:
* You have to know what you're doing to force the bacilli
to make spores, eg industrially.  The bacteria will do it on its
own under certain conditions, ie, its environment is getting harsh.
True for lots of bugs.
That's the knowledge that the germwar people know takes finesse,
making spores and then making a decent inhalable aerosol of the thing.  * There *are* nasties that live in the soil and make spores.  An
archeologist told me of a debilitating lung fungus you get if you dig in the
ground a lot.  A cell biologist told of someone getting a weird
disease because they had fed human hair
to their garden bacteria (to deter animals I think).
* Similar (in a real bio sense) animals will often share
diseases -HIV in primates, anthrax in sheep and the like, etc.
Flu jumps between birds, pigs, and men.  The cowpox/smallpox
interaction has been noted here.  Rabies gets anything warmblooded I think.  Quite a lot of variation in species specificity, and a resivoir in "wild and domestic lower
vertebrates" (like hanta in mice, lyme in deer) is common.
Bacteria chose to make spores when the puddle is drying up.
Given current events, skepticism is even wiser than usual.  But
I wouldn't doubt the existing medical or bio info.
The "extra-vigilance --> extra detection" explanation is of course possible.
Still, *fantastic* timing, as has been pointed out.

If you are filming a nonmoving object you can get very large S/N by
accumulating frames.  If the object is moving its much harder --esp
if moving in 3D.  I once did some research programming for MD/researchers who
film Xray movies of clogged hearts (cineangiography at Cedar Sinai '90-93), who found better recognition of problems if you fixate the feature of

don't have basements and furnaces are in walls

I was astounded that Calif's didn't have basements
