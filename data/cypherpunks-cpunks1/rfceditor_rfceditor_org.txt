        URL:        The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force
attacks, which are well within the reach of a modestly financed
adversary.  As a result, DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Nonetheless, many applications
continue to rely on DES for security, and designers and implementers
continue to support it in new applications.  While this is not always
inappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security
implications in detail, so that designers and implementers have all
the information they need to make judicious decisions regarding its
use.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.

protocols, such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, to setup "unauthenticated"
security associations (SAs) for use with the IPsec Encapsulating
Security Payload (ESP) and the IPsec Authentication Header (AH).  No
changes to IKEv2 bits-on-the-wire are required, but Peer
Authorization Database (PAD) and Security Policy Database (SPD)
extensions are specified.  Unauthenticated IPsec is herein referred
to by its popular acronym, "BTNS" (Better-Than-Nothing Security).  [STANDARDS TRACK]

        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-btns-prob-and-applic-07.txt
        URL:        The Internet network security protocol suite, IPsec, requires
authentication, usually of network-layer entities, to enable access
control and provide security services.  This authentication can be
based on mechanisms such as pre-shared symmetric keys, certificates
with associated asymmetric keys, or the use of Kerberos (via
Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK)).  The need to deploy
authentication information and its associated identities can be a
significant obstacle to the use of IPsec.
This document explains the rationale for extending the Internet
network security protocol suite to enable use of IPsec security
services without authentication.  These extensions are intended to
protect communication, providing "better-than-nothing security"
(BTNS).  The extensions may be used on their own (this use is called
Stand-Alone BTNS, or SAB) or may be used to provide network-layer
security that can be authenticated by higher layers in the protocol
stack (this use is called Channel-Bound BTNS, or CBB).  The document
also explains situations for which use of SAB and/or CBB extensions
are applicable.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.

A new Request for Comments is now available in online RFC libraries.
        RFC 5660
        Title:      IPsec Channels: Connection Latching         Author:     N. Williams

        I-D Tag:    draft-ietf-btns-connection-latching-11.txt
        URL:        This document specifies, abstractly, how to interface applications
and transport protocols with IPsec so as to create "channels" by
latching "connections" (packet flows) to certain IPsec Security
Association (SA) parameters for the lifetime of the connections.
Connection latching is layered on top of IPsec and does not modify
the underlying IPsec architecture.
Connection latching can be used to protect applications against
accidentally exposing live packet flows to unintended peers, whether
as the result of a reconfiguration of IPsec or as the result of using
weak peer identity to peer address associations.  Weak association of
peer ID and peer addresses is at the core of Better Than Nothing
Security (BTNS); thus, connection latching can add a significant
measure of protection to BTNS IPsec nodes.
Finally, the availability of IPsec channels will make it possible to
use channel binding to IPsec channels.  [STANDARDS TRACK]
