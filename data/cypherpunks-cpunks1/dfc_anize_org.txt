GPG/PGP Keysigning @ Computers, Freedom and Privacy 2003
April 2nd, 9:45pm (First BoF Session)
I will be organizing a keysigning session for CFP2003. Please submit
your keys to cfp-keys at anize.org and I will print out sheets with key
information in order to speed up the process. Bring a photo ID and a
copy of your key information so that you can verify what is on the
printout. A list of submitted keys and a keyring will be available on:
Thank you...
