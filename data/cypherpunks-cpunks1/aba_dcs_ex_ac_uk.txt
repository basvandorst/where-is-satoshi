Jeremey Barrett  writes on cpunks:
One way hashes can be used to produce an block encryption system
running in CFB mode, eg: Peter Gutmann's MDC.
(CFB mode is where you encrypt an IV (just a random salt) with the
key, and XOR the result with the data (you chaing the encrypting for
subsequent blocks) -- to decrypt you just repeat the process, use the
same IV and encrypt again.  As you never actually use the block
ciphers decrypt function, you can therefore (and this is what MDC
does) use a one way hash in the place of a block encryption algorithm
in CFB mode.)
They don't seem to be subject to export restrictions, but then perhaps
that is paradoxical, perhaps they should be.  (Well no crypto should
be export restricted in my view naturally, but for logical consistency
you understand...)  It would in my view be a good thing if one way
hash functions were declared to be non-exportable, as this would
clearly hinder commerce, as they are used in signatures and
Also I seem to remember that Dan Berntstien's case was based on the
prior restraint in him not being free to discuss his method for
turning a one way hash into a symmetric key function.

@_subject: Cracking RC4/40 for massive wiretapps 
For known plaintext attack on pure RC4 this would work marvelously,
should get close to linear speed up I think as the greatest overhead
is the key setup.
This was discussed some during the netscape SSL break, it didn't apply
to 40 bit SSL because it was really 128 bit, just with 88 bits
disclosed, so the 88 bits functioned as a salt.  But it applies just
fine to pure RC4-40, ... or even to ECB DES...
This is interesting as applied to DES, does anyone have any banking or
funds transfer protocols handy which use DES in ECB mode :-)
Perhaps we could get DES down to a manageable number of bits, together
with the argument that the attacker wouldn't care who's money he stole.
Thinking of software attacks and RC4-40, if you were attacking pure
RC4-40, you would collect your 16k known-plaintext / ciphertext pairs,
xor them, and sort the xored texts and store them in some kind of
dictionary lookup structure .  Then you'd do the key schedule, then
traverse the btree with each byte that the RC4_encrypt_byte would have
xored with the text being encrypted.  As soon as you took a branch
which didn't exist in the btree you'd move on to the next key and
[hacking interlude]
I got bored so I hacked up a test of this of the overheads of lookups,
using bsearch under linux I get lookups / sec against number of known
  known	plaintext/
  ciphertext			actual		avg time to   pairs		lookups/s	keys/s	keys/s	find a key
  ========================================================
  16k		71k		23k	376M	24 mins
  8k		77k		24k	193M	48 mins
  4k		91k		25k	101M	1.5 hrs
  2k		100k		25k	52M	2.9 hrs
  1k		125k		27k	27M	5.6 hrs
  1		-		34k	34k	187 days
The tests were done on an AMD 486 dx/4 120 (a 120Mhz i486 clone), the
keys/s for pure rc4-40 are from a hand optimised assembly version
which I'd been playing with.
`actual keys' is the keys from the search space of 2^40.
`lookups/s' is the number of bsearches per second for the given sized
pre-xored table.  (Known plaintext xored with ciphertext allows the
check for correct key to be done with memcmp).
`keys/s' is the number of keys tested at once * the actual keys/s
`avg time..' is the expected time before find a key.
So based on one machine, if you had 1000 known plaintexts, you would
get a key in around 5 hours.  Multiply by 100 machines, some faster
some slower and it gets interesting.
Our only problem now is to find someone dumb enough to use pure RC4-40,

To anyone who's read the PGPfone docs, this sounds very similar,
PGPfone uses 3DES (as one option: also CAST, Blowfish), but it's a 2
key 3DES rather than 3 key (I think).  PGPfone works with
9600/14400/28800 modems, uses Diffie Hellman key exchange, uses a
commitment to exchanges by passing the hashes of the exchanges prior
to traditional dh key-exchange (we'll see if this compares to what is
described here as an `interleave protocol').  PGPfone offers several
GSM codecs.
Do you see any barrier to PGPfone being able to interoperate with your
product once your specs are published?  (Aside from a fast PC/MAC to
keep up -- 3DES is the most computationaly expensive encryption
algorithm used by PGPfone).
Also I believe I read somewhere in your announce that upgrades are
possible -- can these happen in software only?  Flash BIOS upgrade?

@_subject: setting up disposable remailers 
Some thoughts on solutions to the remailer operator liability problem.
It occurs to me that the risk for the remailer owner could be reduced
by separating concerns.  That is, introducing separate roles for
setting up the remailer so that the identity of as many parties as
possible is not determinable to the litigator.
Model 1
Separable roles:
- person owning the remailer
- person installing remailer software
- person handling complaints to the remailer
In this model a new remailer owner would anonymously email a member of
the cypherpunks list asking if they would be interested in installing
a remailer in the owners provided account.
The remailer owner would anonymously open an account with an ISP
offering anonymous shell accounts, and accepting digicash, or cash,
and anonymously email the account details to the installer.
Optionally, a third party (the maintainer) could be persuaded to
accept complaints for the remailer, and (anonymously) send signed
instructions to the remailer to bar certain receiving addresses.
The only determinable target for a typical litigator would be the ISP.
If a more powerful adversary were the litigator, such as a TLA anxious
to demonstrate an excuse for it's continued existance, it is possible
they may retrieve the identity of the installer (if they do indeed
have taps and large IP traffic recording facilities for instance).
They may try to hold the installer responsible if unable to find the
owner.  Model 2 goes some way to reducing risk for the installer.
Model 2
In this model the additional separable role of setting up a shell
command mail processor on the account is introduced.  What I mean by
this is as has been discussed on the list recently, that a mail
handler which executes signed shell commands emailed, and anonymously
emails back the command output.
That is to say the remailer owner now passes the account information
to the installer of the mail processor.  The shell installer sets up
the command processor, and leaves.
Now the owner gives the PGP secret key of the command processor to the
remailer installer (or if the owner feels competent, does this part
Provided that the anonymous remailers used for all of the steps are
type2 mixmaster remailers, the system should be much more secure.

@_subject: Encrypted file systems 
Some more thoughts on encrypted file system design criteria.
A wish list:
- Choice of secret key encryption algorithms (IDEA, 3DES, MDC, Blowfish)
- Multiple architectures (MSDOS, Win31, Win95, WinNT, Unix, Mac)
- High performance (hand optimised assembler for each architecture)
- Compression
- Ability to chain algorithms (IDEA and then 3DES for example)
- Possible to have encrypted file systems on separate partitions, or
- Encrypted file system located in a file in another file system   (much like DOS stacker drives) this is an ease of use criteria -- I
  suspect re-partitioning drives would put off many potential users.
- Ease of use.  Graphical user interface for setup and administration
  functions, with a very simple set of configurations options
  displayed by default, with more advanced configuration options
  available in "expert" mode.
- All directory and FAT information should be encrypted, so that
  it is not possible to discover even number of files, or percentage
  of disk used without the key
- Facility for duress key, with the real data hidden in the unused
  space of the first encrypted drive.  To increase the plausible
  deniability all unused blocks within a file system should be filled
  with garbage, so that it is not possible to tell if there is more
  data there.
- File system steganographically hidden in files on another file
  system (encrypted or not).  Support for a wide selection of file
  formats (Aiff, Wave, Midi, JPEG, GIF, RGB, MPEG).
- Ability to use stegoed file system in files on an unencrypted
  file system, and boot from a floppy to access stegoed file system,
  with no other traces left on hard disk.
Thought for the day: the main barrier for a Chinese dissident to using
such software is that being caught with a boot floppy with the
software for a stegoed drive would be dangerous.  What would solve
this would be if Microsoft, Apple, UNIX vendors, Slackware linux
included this functionality (or this software itself as useful
freeware included with the CD distribution) in their respective O/Ses
as non-optional modules -- that is you get the software installed
whether you want it or not.  If everyone has the software, mere
possesion of the software no longer is a problem.
Throw in a few useful utilities, like a steganographic interface to
anonymous remailers, the address of a few ftp/www by email services,
and you have a system with interesting possibilities.
To improve the national security of the US, the NSA should be dropping
CDs with such software (much like war-time propoganda leaflets air
dropped) on undemocratic countries with poor human rights records.
Instead they expend their efforts on ITAR...

@_subject: Opiated file systems 
No need to have all the code in memory, I think you ought to be able
to keep the code in an overlay, or something of that nature.
I take your point about memory consumption under DOS, though
presumably it would be possible these days to load data high.  I think
SFS supports this for instance.
Only the secret key algorithms, 80x86 code would be the highest
priority coz they're the slowest (well the old ones are).  You're
going to need very OS specific code for the low level parts of the
file system anyway.
One of the requirements some earlier posters gave was that they would
like to be able to accesss the same data with different OSes (the
example was to access the same partition with linux,win95, and winNT).
Double space isn't available for unix.  (There was a read-only version
for linux, but this seems to be currently unmaintained.)
So one reason to include a compression module would be for portability
of data.
I agree with your points about separating concerns and keeping crypto
and compression reasonably separate to keep bugs in compression code
having the potential to affect crypto code.  It would probably be
prudent to use OS segment protection, and page locking to protect
crypto code and data from being accidentally overwritten, and written
to swap respectively.
Hmm, say that you were using MDC with md5 as the hash (before
Dobertin's recent pronouncements, naturally no one would do this now),
if Dobertin comes through with the general case you might wish you had
combined it with 3DES...
For the paranoid only, but a nice option I think,
Encrypted filesystems are for hiding data from other parties.  If your
threat model includes law enforcement such a feature would be most
useful.  You would have data which you would not mind agents
obtaining, and have the "real" data hidden in a second file system.
When you are supeonaed for your key, you reveal the 1st file systems
key.  That key does not reveal anything about the 2nd partition, not
even it's existance.
The second file system would be hidden in the blocks not used with the
1st file system.  To access the 2nd file system you would need to tell
the file system driver the keys for both file systems -- the 1st key
so that it could find which were the unused blocks in the 1st file
system, the 2nd key for access to the hidden file system.
Yes, that's the idea -- your 1st key has been supeoned is the threat

Indeed you would.  So?
Nah, you'd buy some video editing equipment, perhaps a photo-CD

@_subject: Opiated file systems 
A problem yes.  My thoughts were that you would effectively have two
filesystems and use them both yourself for real work.  That is to say
that you would say have some consulting work doing some programming or
something, and use the 1st encrypted filesystem for this work.  If
this work was covered by an NDA, so much the better, as it would
provide an understandable reason for encrypting.
I don't think nuking the data is the way to go, from what I understand
of the way these things work, is that they kick down the door in the
dead of night and make sure you don't get to touch the equipment.
Also they'd be sure to take a sector level backup of the drive as a
first step.
If you have your duress encrypted file system, with the "real" file
system in the unused space of that filesystem, and the hidden file
system is encrypted with an unknown (to them) 3DES key, I don't see
how they are going to be able to prove that it is not just noise.
(This is presuming it is a feature of this encrypting file system that
it ensures unused space is always filled with noise anyway, even
inside the first layer of encryption)
The question of freshness Mark raised, if I understand correctly is
interesting.  I presume here he is talking about the fact that under
analysis it is possible to retrieve information from hard drives which
has been deleted and overwritten even multiple times with other data,
due to the relative inaccuracy of disk head placement, and other
factors.  Perhaps it is even possible to tell how recent a magnetic
pattern is even?
In an encrypted file system with no hidden file system, if the unused
space were filled with random garbage, you might expect that garbage
to have been modified fewer times, or less recently than the real
data.  If there were a second hidden file system in those unused
blocks, it might show up due to being written to more recently, or
more often than expected.
If the threat model includes this kind of analysis, I think it would
be necessary to ensure that all the data is churned evenly, or
sufficiently that there is little chance of extracting this kind of
What I would suggest is that during periods of disk inactivity the
data (even the unused space whether it is a 2nd partition or not) is
re-encrytped with a new random IV at some frequency.  The frequency
chosen should be to ensure that all the data on the disk is recent,
and that in the course of disk usage over a period of a week there are
many re-writes with data re-encrypted with random IVs to all areas of
the disk.
I think you would have to mount them both during normal usage to avoid
damaging the real filesystem hidden in the unused space.  Only in the
event of a duress situation would you mount only the duress file
This next bit must be talking about the stegoed file system:
Careful.  For stego you can't use publically available images -- they
have to be images you scanned yourself, other-wise comparison will
show that the images have been altered.  (Law enforcement agents read
a.b.p.* too).

That was my meaning: either 1 or 2 filesystems, at the users option,
and for the file system to look the same to anyone not holding the 2nd
key (if there is one) whether or not there is a 2nd hidden file system.
More subtle than straight nuke the data, but still they'll have the
backup, and the code to reverse-engineer.
Another idea might be to have secret shared keys to your encrypted fs,
so you can't access your file system without your friend(s)
co-operation.  That would give your friends an opportunity to nuke
their share of the key before they got their dawn raid.  You could
automate the nuking, with some pre-arranged policy for key destruction
(eg the computers could bounce messages off each other, and if this
stops the key-portion gets nuked).
However, the opposition is already one step ahead: simultaneous dawn
raids were the fad during operation Sun-Devil, just in case of such
schemes I presume.

I thought the presumption was that source code was provided (for the
duress feature too)?
The whole system should be designed to withstand scrutiny as to
whether or not there is a duress file system on any given disk, on the
assumption that the opponent as full access to the source.
ie. the attacker can not tell without the hidden file system key (if
one exists) whether the unused space on your drive is really just
that: unused space filled with garbage, or whether it is in fact
another encrytped filesystem.
They might be suspicious, but I don't think they would be able to
claim you were in comptempt of court, if you provide the 1st key and
claim there is no other key: the software has support for either 1 or
2 filesystems.

User apathy, people not reading documentation, documenting it as an
advanced feature... etc.
How many people actually generate a PGP key revocation cert in advance
in case of losing the key for instance?
Good point.  But what other data does the attacker have aside from how
many others do?  Even knowing how many others do would be
tricky.. are they telling the truth when they say they aren't?
Smart analysis, yes you'd have to be very careful to partition the way
you used the two file systems.  You'd have to pretend that the 2nd
partition did not exist when comunicating with any one who you didn't
trust.  Perhaps you could have some assistance even... making the
duress file system read only when you have the hidden fs mounted as an
option to remove the chance of accidentally copying something from the
hidden fs that you couldn't (otherwise) explain being your possesion?
Someone cooperating with the attacker could be tricky though,
ultimately there's not much you can do about infiltration aside from
always using a nym for correspondence to do with your hidden persona
which goes with your hidden fs.
Hmm, the psychological aspect of your plausible deniability.  Don't
think cryptographic protocols can do much about that.
But I don't think stego solves your whole problem: you still have to
have software to access the stegoed data.  Where do you store this?
Nearly back to square one.  (If the answer is on a floppy this applies
equally to a duress file system).
The one advantage of stegoed data is that you expect the least
sig. bits in image files to be random, where-as you don't expect the
LSBs in unused space (even in encrytped file systems once you're
inside the encryption layer) to be random.
However the disadvantage is 8 - 24 times reduction in space
efficiency.  (Your earlier point).

Ah I see what you're getting at.  My solution (I'm sure I wrote this

You could be right, I'm not sure how it would go in practice.  But I
don't think there is really much more you can do unless you assume the
ability to conceal a piece of hardware from your opponents.  Say like
a floppy disk with the stego or duress drivers on?  But that gives
rise to all sorts of problems also... where do you store it when

from crackers could be used to run transient nodes in the Eternity
service.  A useful ethical role for system crackers even.
Or alternatively perhaps there are enough countries around that
Anderson's suggested use of many jurisdictions (particularly those
with low regard for copyright would be good candidates) would be
possible.  These countries could lead the role in supplying the
service for the unenlightened powers in other countries.  I have a
vague memory of hearing that there is at least one country which has
no copyrights on software for individuals, but does for commercial
use.  Perhaps the service could survive on this model for a while
before the US/NATO/OECD felt obligated to act as world police man and
offer to nuke the countries, or cut off all trade or something.
You bet!  It would be a most excellent source for a number of groups: - cypherpunks, users of crypto software for ITAR restricted material
- Scientologist detractors could publish their views anonymously
  without fear of reprisals, remove problems of censorship in general
- People who use copyright software without buying it: copyright
  software could be distributed with impunity, for free
- Anyone with an interest in obtaining a permanent URL for themselves
  could purchase 50 years worth of exposure for 1Mb (Anderson proposes
  selling space with ecash per Mb year).
Depends on your views of the benefits to society as a whole of
copyright, patents and so on.  Granted many have commercial interests
in seeing these systems continue.  Some people on this list seem to be
of the opinion that patents, and product copyright are becoming an
obsolete system with near free copying.  (These people make analogies
with the advent of the printing presses, the loss of power of guilds,
and so on).
I'm not sure it need destroy civilization as we know it if some of
these changes did take place... many people would benefit from access
to a wider range of software and ideas.  There is the argument that
perhaps people won't bother to write software if they can't sell it.
I think that vendors would -cope- if software copyright were
hypothetically to be disabled in one swoop as a fait-acompli, they
would structure their charges differently: charge less perhaps,
include printed manuals (photocopying often costs more than the book),
include tech support contracts, and so on.
I'm sure it's widely acknowledged that only a modest percentage of
software is actually bought anyway (if we were to take a brief survey
(anonymous of course) of the percentage of non-paid for software on
their hard-drives, a fair amount of non-copyright compliance by
individuals would be demonstrated).

@_subject: opinions on book "The Truth Machine" 
If you mean myself, this had not occured to me and I assure you I have
no connections with the author, and no interest in promoting sales of
his book.
There is no charge to read the book on line -- and I for one wouldn't
buy a paper book I have electronic copy for.  I saw the URL posted (by
the author of the book judging by the From line) in
talk.politics.crypto and read it on line.
The only "charge" for reading is to fill in short questionaires as you
The writing style wasn't great, and I'd agree there were plenty of
flaws, but what I was interested in was cypherpunks opinions on the
technology, rather than the quality of the book, or making money for
the author!  This was my reason for making the post to cypherpunks.
Admitedly it was 5am when I made the post (having just finished
reading said book) and I didn't explain myself... lets try again:
The interesting technologies touched on were:
- cheap video used by everyone to record their own lives
This has been talked about in cyperpunks in the past, and from that
discussion I seem to remember that there was talk of a trial with
police in some area of the US wearing mini-cams to protect them from
claims of police brutality.
- the book has video streams transmitted in real time to some database
(state run? I'm not sure it was clear, also no mention of encryption).
If it was an option to have video stored in the device itself
encrypted or transmitted to a data haven encrypted, I don't see
anything wrong with that so long as it's voluntary and nothing to do
with government.
That government might have a go at mandating a "voluntary" video
survielance set up doesn't seem that unrealistic in the current
political climate.  Having just read your post on curfews my response
was what the fuck, are you serious?  It totally amazes me that public
opinion has got to the stage that something like this would be
accepted.  Sounds like a military dictatorship.  Children first,
adults next?  The level of peoples paranoia about reducing crime at
any cost has been severely underestimated.  Surely that's way out of
line constitutionally?
The price and the storage technology for a tamper resistant storage
device linked to a CCD at cheap commodity price hasn't quite come
about yet.  When it gets cheap enough, I think this could become
called for -- children first perhaps as the curfew.  Random police
searches asking you what your business is.
- wide use of accurate lie detectors
the book has everyone wearing a wrist communicator / lie detector /
video recorder.  If someone wants to walk around with a light that
will flash if they tell a lie, again that's there problem.  It would
be kind of fun to see politicians required to wearing one.  But as
Sandy pointed out the `national security' and the need to lie to the
people for the benefit of the people might be bought up as a reason to
defend dishonest politicians.
the book talks about 100% accurate lie detectors with no
qualifications which is obviously nonsense, I'm not sure what success
current lie detectors have, but there would no doubt be lots of
problems.  People are able to fool current lie detectors, and as I
understand it the detectors look for subtle physical signs of
distress, changes in skin conductivity caused by distress, and some
are able to lie without suffering any distress.  It seems reasonable
that use of a wider range of sensory devices as input, and more
sophisticated analysis of the signals could improve on reliability of
the current lie detectors.
Interesting questions arise if they become accurate enough that they
can be used to supplement or even replace much of the legal system.
The state mandated requirement of people to routinely submit to lie
detector tests is of course totally unacceptable, but if you get to
the stage of having curfews (still amazed at that) and the police are
legally allowed to ask you to submit to a lie detector test asking a
few more questions during the random spot check seems likely.
For instance I have been stopped by the police four times late at
night driving home, as I live some distance from the university.  The
questions are basically what is your business (ie what are you doing
so late at night), and then they get you to take in your papers to the
police station within 1 week which is an inconvenience.  Also the
practice over here seems to be to do a spot check on the state of the
vehicle, quick visual inspection of the tires with flashlight, check
on the lights, do they all work -- dip / full, indicate.  Also at the
same time they ask for ID.  On one of the occasions the officer asked
what an object inside the car was (it was on the floor beteen the seat
and the door well and visible with the door open) -- a wheel wrench (2
foot wrench and socket), I said it was a wheel wrench, and he made a
comment that he had thought it was something to hit someone with.
Jeez.  It would have been a pretty good object to hit someone with as
far as that goes, but it has also proved a remarkably useful object
for changing a flat tyre.
I'm not sure where I would stand on this legally, but I have so far
resisted the temptation to tell them it's none of their business.
While we're on the topic of the increase in the police state
mentality: in the UK recently as the result of some nut shooting up a
school, gun laws are due to get stricter yet.  They are I think
talking about making it law that all target pistols must be kept at
the gun club (whereas currently you can take them home to clean (but
not shoot)).
Also they are actually talking about restricting the sale of replica
guns.  What'll they do now recall childrens toys which are too
realistic?  Idiots.

Ah .. I misunderstood, the ad is being spammed.  We have a truly awful
news feed which gets around 2 weeks of lag, at time of posting that
was the only one I'd seen.
um, ok.  The presentation of it in the book was sketchy, and many of
his conclusions I felt shaky, but here's a few entries I think
plausible for lie detectors:
- travelling by car in the US a few years ago at a border check point
between two US states the border gaurds asked if anyone in the car was
not US, they made a point of looking you in the eye while questioning
you.  In conversation later it was suggested that they are trained to
observe and notice people who look nervous for some reason.  Seems
that if a technology was available to improve the reliability of quick
spot check questions they wouldn't have any compunction using it.
- drink driving breath tests (a real lie detector) to check if you
have been drinking.  No longer content with asking if you've been
drinking they ask, and then breathalize you.  In the UK it is an
offence to refuse a breath test if stopped whilst driving.
- some automation for `anything to declare?' questions at customs, a
lie detector, say put your hand on here, then `anything to declare?'
Just trying to think up some plausible examples of where it might one
day be legally required to take a lie detector test in the course of
your normal business.
ta, will take a look.
lest that was misleading: the documents required for presentation at
police station are insurance certificate, and MOT document
(roadworthiness certificate (another infringement of liberty in my
view, you are legally required to keep your vehicles in A1 condition,
and the strictness of the tests keeps creeping up)).  Explaining your
movements as I say I'm unsure of the legal position, but they ask you
Well, we don't have curfews yet, but they're getting keen on security
video cameras lately, the university has a few even, on top of
buildings, the steerable variety, and with what I presume are IR spots
mounted on them.

@_subject: UK Crypto regs? 
Ross Anderson posted this report on sci.crypt:
Newsgroups: sci.crypt,alt.security,uk.telecom,alt.security.pgp
I went to the meeting organised at the IEE yesterday on the UK
`Trusted Third Party' proposals. One of the speakers, Nigel Hickson of
the DTI, confirmed that escrowing of confidentiality keys would be
mandatory. He also claimed that an OECD expert group was working on
`global crypto guidelines', and made clear that the controls would
focus on small-to medium enterprises and individuals rather than on
large companies.
It was a most extraordinary meeting, and showed up GCHQ in a rather
poor light. The introductory talk was given by Andrew Saunders,
advertised as head of CESG (GCHQ's protection arm) since 1991 and a
GCHQ board member. He remarked that the debate on encryption had been
acrimonious, especially in the USA, but that now technology made
possible a compromise in the form of `Trusted Third Parties' which
would supply a key delivery service and a key recovery service for
both users and law enforcement authorities.
I asked him whether his department had advised ministers that it was
all right to release the April report on encryption in the NHS network
(which floated the TTP idea), or had at least had sight of it before
its release. He claimed to have no knowledge of whether his agency had seen it.
After a talk on the common criteria by Murray Donaldson of the
Ministry of Defence, Saunders left, and we were addressed by a man
introduced as Paul Fleury, head of the information systems security
group at the security service. He was claimed to have been with MI5
for 18 years, and in his current post for 5; and to head a team of 9
people responsible for the overall UK threat assessment (with
technical input from GCHQ), as well as for managing CRAMM and running
UNIRAS (the UK government equivalent of CERT).
Strangely enough for such a senior and responsible person, his name did
not appear on the programme, and in the list of participants he appears
only as `UNIRAS SPEAKER, Security Service, PO Box 5656, London EC1A 1AH'
(so now you know - but why did he turn up with slides that had his name
on them and yet not write his name in the attendance register?)
His talk contained little to surprise, with statistics on viruses, equipment thefts and hacking. He did mention that 98% of the 873 hacking incidents in 1994/5 were abuse of access by insiders rather than external attack.
The third talk was by Elizabeth France, the Data Protection Registrar,
who expressed amusement at my having ironically referred to her (along
with the other speakers) as `one of the forces of darkness' when I
relayed notice of the meeting to the net. She proceeded to blaze with
light; she argued that the national security exemptions to data
protection law should be curtailed, and could see no reason why the
security service should not have to register along with everybody
else. She also pleaded for the wider use of privacy enhancing
technologies, such as the use of pseudonyms in medical databases.
Next was John Austen of the Yard, who pointed out that company
directors can get ten years' jail if one of their employees has
kiddieporn on a company server, since under the Children and Young
Persons Act simple possession is an offence. Then Bob Hill of the MoD
talked about the SOS-TDP project to provide security interfaces in
Microsoft, Novell and DEC products, linked with Northern Telecom's
`Enterprise Security Toolkit'; David Ferbrache of DRA talked about
security threats from the Internet; John Hughes of TIS about
firewalls; and Alex McIntosh of PCSL about how his company built a
crypto infrastructure for Shell and got government approval for it.
The threat model depicted in these talks was remote from reality. For
example, it was categorically stated that most thefts of PCs are for
the information in them, rather than the resale value of the machine
or its components. False - over 11% of UK general practitioners have
experienced theft of a practice PC, yet there is only one case known
to the BMA in which the information was abused.  Another example was
the numbers put on various threats: satellite TV hacking was said to
cost 300,000 pounds a year (according to News Datacom at Cardis 94,
that should be 200,000,000) while other risks were wildly inflated.
Bob Morris, the former NSA chief scientist, is fond of asking security
researchers, `Do you consider yourself to be more dishonest, or more
incompetent?' Well, does GCHQ know that the threat model presented at
their meeting is wrong, or don't they?
Anyway, Alex McIntosh's talk brought matters back to crypto policy
when he explained that following UK and US government approval of a corporate security architecture designed for Shell, Fortune 500 companies would be trusted to manage their own keys. The explanation is
that they have so much to lose that they will be responsive to warrants and subpoenas. (The doctrine of equality of persons before the law was not, of course, mentioned.)
The final speaker was Nigel Hickson from the DTI. The excuse given for
his late arrival ws that he had been in France with the OECD and had
been discussing crypto policy for three days. He looked somewhat junior
but was said to co-chair the ITSEC scheme with CESG and to be one of a
group of five people in DTI responsible for information security policy.
In the introduction to his talk, he picked up on Alex's remarks about
Shell and stated that the motivation for the DTI's involvement was
that while `large firms will crack security', it would be an
inhibiting factor for small-to-medium firms and individuals, and would
prevent them participating in commerce on the Internet (this seemed to
clash with the policy announcement that corporate encryption would be
regulated but private would not be).
He then quite blatantly waffled until his time was almost up before
getting to the reason most people had come to the meeting, namely the
DTI announcement of its intent to regulate `Trusted Third Parties'. My
notes on his words are as follows:
 Why the UK announcement? Many reasons, some of which are highlighted in
 the public statement. The primary reason is that to secure electronic
 commerce people will need access to strong crypto, and if this is serious  then government will have to look at what systems are `appropriate'. The  UK government has spent a lot of time discussing the essential balance.
 Continued law enforcement access is required along the lines of the
 Interception of Communications Act. The government has `obviously' looked
 at TTPs and at `elements of key escrow'. There was no mention of national
 intelligence requirements.
 Policy framework for the provision of encryption services:
 1	No new controls on the use of encryption, such as types of
 2	Licensing of TTPs will be on (a) competence (b) ability to
 3	International working will be the essential vehicle to drive it
 Legislation later this year is possible. The EU is working on a `second
 infosec decision' to promote TTPs in Europe. The OECD expert group is
 working on global crypto guidelines.
By the time he had finished this short exposition, he had run over the advertised time of 4.15, eating well into the fifteen minutes that the programme had allocated for discussion. There were only a few questions:
Paul Leyland managed to ask whether it would be mandatory for confidentiality keys to be escrowed, and Hickson said yes.
Just as the questions were starting to flow, the chairman - advertised
as Mr DJ Robertson, Ministry of Defence - declared the meeting closed. I objected; I pointed out that there were plenty of people with questions, and that the government's attempts to sell their proposal would not be aided by such blatant news management, which would surely be reported. He said that we absolutely had to be out of the room by half past four - the time then - and overruled me, remarking that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge had asked quite enough questions.
Then a large gentleman came up to me and said that he hoped my remark
about publicising their news management had been made in jest. I told him that it was not, and he became menacing. He said that the meeting was held under IEE rules and seemed taken aback when I stood my ground and told him I was a member. He then said that he was also a graduate of Cambridge and that he would write to very senior people in the University about me. Good luck to him. Although he wouldn't give me his name, his lapel badge said `B Buxton' and the attendance register lists a Bill Buxton, Parity Solutions Ltd., Wimbledon Bridge House, 1 Hartford Road, Wimbledon SW19 3RU.
After the meeting, we milled around, to the evident discomfiture of the man advertised as Robertson. Finally, at almost five o'clock, an IEE lady turned up while there were still a few of us in the corridor. He asked her to see us off the premises, at which she smiled and asked
whether we knew our way out. When I said yes, she said 'that's all right then' and went off. The man advertised as Robertson scuttled away without
meeting my eye.
As Bob would ask, incompetence or dishonesty? Well, I didn't get the impression that our spooks are even competent at being dishonest.

Sorry to contribute to the simply awesome noise to signal ratio here
lately (hopefully the subject tag should help those not interested in

[if you don't know what I'm talking about, see
for a combined perl hack and ITAR violation]
Due mainly to a couple of insights donated by someone who was
introduced to the code via a friends `munition' T-shirt... he started
the ball rolling again...
it shrunk from:
 -s-- -export-a-crypto-system-sig -RSA-3-lines-PERL

$/=unpack('H*',$_);$_=`echo 16dio\U$k"SK$/SM$n\EsN0p[lN*1
(Actually it's not quite as impressive as it might look at first
glance because the old version included the comment "-export-a-
crypto-system-sig -RSA-3-lines-PERL", so the new one should really be
compared against:
 -s
$m=unpack(H.$w,$m."\0"x$w),$_=`echo "16do$w 2+4Oi0$d*-^1[d2%Sa
pack('H*',$_)while read(STDIN,$m,($w=2*$d-1+length($n)&~1)/2)
but it's still a whole 31 bytes shorter, and it now really is in 3
lines of perl rather than cheating and not counting the line.  (Several people took me to task on that one).
I won't consume list bandwidth describing exactly how the new one
works, and the arcane perl and dc hackery that went into it, as I have
described it all in excruciating detail on:
I really wasn't expecting to see it shortened any further.
There goes all those T-shirts, outdated, my sincere apologies to
Richard White also, whose tattoo was featured in the April issue of
Wired (at least the UK edition, the US one too?),
Oh yeah, and if you can see any ways to shorten it, please tell me!
(Perl5 specifics not allowed, there is already a shorter p5 specific
version but it's got to be as portable as possible).
ps I now have a reasonable stock of T-shirts again after the prolonged
hiatus of my printer, who finally delivered the 2nd batch.

Keep your secret key in your head.
Your plausible deniability has to get quite low before it will stand

Your real challenge is keeping your stego programs safe.  Boot

&Sprint pack(C,$_^=$s[($s[$x]+$s[$y])%256])}sub S{
The other problem I see is that if you have a stego file system in an
audio file, your disk writes are going look strange.  The inaccuracy
of disk head placement, is going to ensure that someone with the know
how will be able to copy off the last dozen pieces of data you wrote.
If they are all the same data with the exception of the LSB, it's
goint to look fishy.  Solid state storage devices are better.

You could probably keep a hashing function around plausibly, then you
could do as usual and remember the passphrase and use the hash
function to construct the actual key.
Your plausible deniability has to drop below 100%, your data has
deviate from "indistinguishable from normal data distributions" to get
yourself investigated in the first place.
If your stego techniques are any good, the feds will never get beyond
that point.  They will then be left with the option of doing random
`spot-checks'.  Having been on the cypherpunks list probably would
increase your chances of having your system checked.
That program is optimised for size rather than ease of memorizing.
RC4 is an elegantly simple algorithm, and I sumbit that you could
remember it.  Barring that you could just leave around a few
cypherpunks archives, or sci.crypt archives or whatever, and cut and
paste it form one of my posts :-)
Because RC4 is a stream cipher, you shouldn't reuse the key.  However
you shouldn't need to for this application.  You just use it to boot-
strap the real code.
You'd need to put in the appropriate stego decoder (say getting the
bytes from the LSbit of an audio file.  Linux loop back devices
already provide the stego capability directly.  But then linux loop
back devices provide IDEA encryption.  (I'm talking about Ian
Goldbergs patch to the loopback filesystem, which may not have been
folded back in yet).
Also you may be able to get somewhere with algorithms which are
plausible to have coded on your system anway.  Say, RC4 makes a good
PRNG, so what's wrong with having it in a standard library.  That
makes coding RC4 really simple.  Just reseed the PRNG with your key,
and XOR it's output with the encrypted file.
Also I did hear tell that Bruce Schneier was working on a crypto
algorithm which was designed to work with playing cards, for a book
which Neal Stephenson is writing.  Presumably painful to use, but
maybe good plausible deniability, all that you need is a pack of
Once you've bootstrapped to your cryptoanarchists toolkit, you can
have anything you want, even a virtual TCP/IP layer, a hidden level of
TCP/IP in stego data.  TCP/IP itself is a likely candidate for a stego
carrier.  Non-predictable sequence nos are required to stop things
like the spoofing attack, and so are perfectly plausible.
The real pain at the moment is that bandwidth is so darned low.
You're talking 28.8k for most users, and I'd quite merrily pay $2000 a
year for a fractional T1 for personal use, but prices over here are
too high yet.
Once we get to everyone having enough bandwidth, lots of people with
permanent connections, lots of people using video conference software,
audio, downloading feature length films, etc. there's no stopping
crypto anarchy.  The LSbits in that lot would make a fairly responsive
subliminal channel by todays standards.
You get paid in ecash, paid on the BlackNet bank.  You take a holiday
to a tax-haven and get paid off by a getting "lucky" at a BlackNet
affiliated casino.  The casino takes a their "currency exchange fee",
and you get US$.  Translations into paper currencies, I'll admit are
the weak link if you need paper currencies.  However there are two ways to get anonymous electronic cash, either
you start with anonymous electronic cash, or you add the anonymity
afterwards via `privacy brokers', once there are a few dozen systems,
and trillions flowing around using these systems, it's going to be
hard to keep track of it all.

across remailers, so that the chosen proportion, k of n remailers are
sufficent for your reply to get through.

The first remailer doesn't necessarily have to be trustworthy; it
depends what it is you are trying to hide.
If you are trying to hide the fact that you are sending mail via
remailers, then to some extent the first remailer matters.  But
presumably, if you are sending to remailers, watching all the email
you send would be the obvious way to see if you are using remailers.
Your options to hide the fact that you are sending to remailers would
be to forward your mail (encrypted) to someone else who does use
remailers.  Or perhaps a hypothetical system in which you
steganographically encode your to be remailed message to a newsgroup
which is scanned by the your entry remailer.
If on the other hand you are trying to conceal who you are sending to,
and you don't send to many messages, using mixmaster you would retain
some anonymity even if all bar one remailer were run by the spooks.
As mixmaster remailers have uniform packet sizes, and reordering of
messages, it's not going to be obvious which message coming from the
trustworthy remailer is yours.
Flooding attacks on remailers are when the spook run remailers try to
keep the trustworthy remailer fairly loaded with email, so that the
non-spook traffic shows up.  In the worst case, only your message
would be non-spook traffic in a given reorder batch, and you would
lose all anonymity.

The above presumes that you can plausibly use good quality random
number generators.  You need to because that is the problem
specification: you need the TCP sequence nos to be unpredictable.
However, playing along with possible LE avenues of attack, one avenue
of attack might be to require strong PRNG seeds to be handed over to
the Feds.  Or more specifically they might require that anything
computer generated which was unpredicatable to be made predicatable
for the government.
Still it seems unlikely that all subliminal channels could be blocked,
and you still have inherently noisy text, audio, and image files.
A very good idea.  There was some discussion of this kind of thing a
while back about doing this for Singapore.  The suggestion at the time
was not to do it perfectly, but rather to arrange something simple to
allow people to circumvent the censorship enforced through their
compulsory use of a government censored web proxy.
I would suggest starting with remailers, rather than interactive
traffic such as web traffic would be the easier target.  Might even
present a positive spin in the press for anonymity and remailers for a
So what good stego techniques are there for text.  Do singaporeans use
a non ascii character set?  (As the Chinese use things like Big5
encoding). Anyone know of any features of the character set that
Singaporeans use which could be used for a subliminal channel?
Lets give a simple example of a way to create an anonymous payment
system from a fully traced payment system.  Say that an anonymous
privacy broker started a privacy club.  In this club, the participants
place into the pot $100 traceable ecash.  The privacy broker shuffles
the $100 payments, and hands them out.  The privacy brokers
reputation, or the algorithms ensure that the broker can't cheat and
abscond with money.
Sure, if you keep cypherpunks list going even after crypto discussions
have been outlawed, you can keep discussions, and then the ammount of
ecash usage, and bandwidth may be more condusive to working out
anonymous payment systems.

encrypted key rings are a Good Idea.  I think PGP3 does this, so I
guess you are interested in doing it in a compatible way.  (premail
provides a `secrets' file.  I think it would be useful to generalise
this facility so that other programs could use this facility.) ps I also picked apart the weird IDEA cfb, (using the code, and not the

@_subject: Secrecy: My life as a nym. (Was: nym blown?) 
The problem for me when people talk about suing people for slander in
net discussions is that it involves governments and laws impinging on
the internet.  Other examples of legislation interacting with the
internet have been entirely negative: some people have called for
legislation to stop "spamming", legislation to restrict pornography,
"indecent speech", etc, etc The internet in my view is best off with
the least possible government or legal interference.
It is difficult to see ways for you to stop people intentionally
damaging your nym's reputation capital however.  Aside from the more
speech to fight the speech, you are left with the reputation capital
If someone with a low reputation slanders someone with a high
reputation, this reduces the impact of the slander, and clueful
readers one presumes regard the derogatory statements on the part of
the slanderer as suspect.
However this still leaves the less clueful (the newbies to a
discussion group for instance), and also the chance that others are
still slightly affected by these statements.
Something else I might suggest, if a nym becomes too valuable to risk
using for posting to flame prone discussion groups, perhaps a lower
value nym could be used in such discussions.  This has disadvantages,
in that you have to start over building reputation capital, and so
forth.  But such is life.  You have another nym which you used for the
DCSB talk, and one presumes other ones for use in real world business.
You use nyms accordingly.
There are plenty of people with a wont to sue people for all sorts of
things.  Many of them would do so on much less grounds than perhaps
you might.  Some get pretty groundless, in fact.  Colin James III
being one example.  (Erk, may be I ought to be using a nym here, I
hear he scans newsgroups, but hopefully not mailing lists)
It stifles discussion to bring real monetary threats behind peoples
words.  It is also in some sense a call to outside authority,
something which I resent.  For instance many of the people CJ III has
harrased from my reading have suffered considerable inconvenience.  No
need to mention a certain pseudo-religious organisation which has made
extensive use of law suits for the purpose of harrassing it's
Now I'm sure the idea of slander law suits is to stop the slander,
recompense for damages etc. but it is a thing prone to misuse, and
balanced in favour of those with money.
Someone who is using a nym, and for purposes including avoiding the
possibility of frivolous law suits, to suggest suing someone who
slanders this nym is not that productive I think.  The slanderer may
also adopt the same strategy, and adopt their own nym!  Nym sues nym.  I think not.  An alternate view of slander law suits is
as a way to encourage the use of Nyms.  Certainly the dissenters of
the unnamed pseudo religious have learnt the value of nyms, remailers
and so forth.  There are distinct advantages to nyms.

Yep.  Some people even voiced the opinion that it was a good thing
that penet closed down, because now people would have to use better

their was discussion of the cypherpunks type I remailers.  The ease of

replyable email addresses and are much better than penet, though also
not perfect.
Ease of use seems to be a huge requirement for many people, which is
presumably what lead to penets success.  Programs like private Idaho
mean that there is little excuse for not using real remailers.

legal reason alone.  Being _paid_ for forwarding the message may make
that even worse.
Often the posts which would get the anonymous poster (or the true name

interesting, and also very on topic.
Howabout someone liberates skipjack and forwards it to you via
remailers with $50 for your trouble.  Do you bite?  I thought not, NSA

Also the distinction between generating a psuedo random pad, and

largely a matter of interpretation.  This _is_ for example how RC4
works: RC4 has a PRNG the output of which is XORed with the data to be
encrypted.  The seed to the RC4 PRNG is the cryptographic key.  If you
prefered, an equivalent view of RC4 would be to say it produces a
pseudo randomly generated PAD which is XORed with the data.

I've seen mentioned as crypto friendlies in list discussion recently:
Netscape, PGP Inc (obviously:-), Silicon Graphics, others?  (The
internet casino people?)
The SSL challenge had a digicash prize fund, and Pete Wenzel won c$ 442.30.
With the advent of a real money backed digicash bank, Mark Twain bank,
perhaps someone with an account could set up a page for donors to give
donations via MT digicash.  This would allow anonymous donations.
Perhaps First Virtual payments too.  Someone who can accept credit
card payments for donations would be real handy too.
Anyone still with contacts at MT (Lucky?) would they be interested in
promoting the idea, perhaps donating prize cash.  Also FV could gain
some positive publicity by supporting.
(For fun, you could take the prize money, in the form payable to
anyone, as MT ecash, and encrypt it with DES.  Publish it as the
challenge.  The winner gets the cash:-)
You're probably aware of most of the below, as you were involved with
the Netscape SSL break, so this is really just a suggestion that you
might be able to cut some corners on time to implement by borrowing
some stuff.
Take a look at SKSP (Simple Key Search Protocol) before you do, this
was what was used for the 31 hr Netscape SSL brute force.
Piete Brooks  has perl implementations for clients
and servers, and should be able to point you at the draft RFC for
SKSP.   was a DNS he set up for the purpose.
Some of the software is available starting from:
Andy Brown  wrote a win95/NT client for the SKSP
protocol, this would be another reason to use the protocol, few
modifications presumably would be required to the NT client to work
for a DES break.
SKSP was written to make it possible to have a multiple tier system,
with key dolers taking out large chunks from the main server, and
doling it out to clients, or further sub-servers.  Multiple servers
could be also managed by multiple IPs for the same DNS name, with
random selection of the IPs, to share out work for the servers.
The protocol was set up to do multiple targets (bruterc4, brutessl,
all that would be needed would be a brutedes which followed the
template of responses, especially for the unix setup).
The protocol also had some (albeit weak) protection against mistakes,
and uninformed malicious attacks -- the acknowledgements are only
counted with a checksum.  (It is fairly trivial to generate the
checksum without doing the work).
As a way of providing slightly more robust reslience to malicious
attacks, I remember that the approach of the server picking a random
key in the range doled out, and computing the decrypt for that key
itself was discussed in relation to the SSL attack.  The key matching
the decrypt would then form the sanity check.
People can still can abuse the system, but they can't help doing some
work, even if they lie about the outcomes, and this slows them down.

  then speech synthesis software to put that back into speech.
Of course pauses in speech, and the actual words and positions taken
show through, and these doubtless contain cues, as does body language.
I thought that perhaps speech synthesis (so that you could type) or
both speech recognition, followed by speech synthesis, together with
PGPfone, and a high bandwidth TCP packet `remailer' might be a fun
application.  Plus a gateway back in to the phone system, paid for by
ecash (double blinded ecash).
All doable currently, I think.  With sufficient users of the remailer,
you should be able to get packet lag down, and still converse
relatively interactively anonymously.  Better than a pay phone, your
link could be encrypted to the remailer with a forward secret protocol
(PGPfone is forward secret), even if the recipient was using an
ordinary phone.
Talking about attempting to discover whether politicians are lying
(apart from `at all times by definition'), it seems that even if a
highly accurate lie detector were developed, puppet politicians could
be kept ignorant, and fed the info to discuss, so that they could tell
untruths without knowing they were untruths, and so better pass
Also some pathological liars apparently can do well at lie detectors
because they are so used to lying that they can lie with no
compunction.  Successful politicians would be selected from those who
possess such qualities.  (One suspects most are pretty good already,
in any case)

Hey Bert-Jaap, I had you down as one of the good guys, what caused you
to fold :-)
Bert-Jaap Koops  writes on cpunks:
OK, so I can see how the `binding data' technique acheives a more
robust form of keys escrow of session keys, without handing over
private keys.  (Your wording also implied to me that the problem would
not exist if private keys were handed over, but I think this is not
the case, if a warrant is required to get the private keys, the stated
presumtion is that no speculative decryptions will be tried).  Also
the proposal (and other proposals which escrow session keys) doesn't
really provide any guarantees of protection from LE abuse, as such,
because they can decrypt all of the escrowed session keys with their
own private key.  But then the original clipper proposal had similar
supposed safeguards, they claimed to have the decryption keys split
across two databases, and they claimed that they would place the key
in a tamper resistant device so that it could only be used for the
duration of the court approved wiretap.
`binding data' combats the problem of people sabotaging key escrow by
using garbage for the escrowed session key.  Matt Blaze was able to
produce compliant capstone/tessera messages which would be accepted by
the recipient, and yet would reveal nothing to the LE agent.  Your
binding data technique would allow a software only implementation of
the non-interoperability requirements of clipper III, and combat
attacks such as Matt's.
However, simpler approaches I think fulfill the requirements given the
(stated) voluntary nature of GAK.
For instance, if you are using a hybrid RSA/symmetric key system with
the session key encrypted with RSA, you can encrypt the session key to
a second recipient also (PGP allows this much, Carl Ellison suggested
this for PGP, Bill Stewart recently also suggested the same).  If the
recipient wishes to check that the sender is really escrowing the same
session key, this can be acheived by revealing to the primary
recipient the random padding of the second recipient's RSA encrypted
copy of the session key.  The primary recipient can then repeat the
encryption, and check.  (I proposed this on sci.crypt last year some
time, with an anti-GAK caveat :-).
As GAK is (stated to be) voluntary, surely the only person who has any
business knowing whether the message is honestly GAKked is the
recipient.  After all you can double encrypt or not use GAK at your
option, so this seems to lose nothing for the GAKkers.
The description of the paper also says nothing about trust worthiness
of the TTPs, from the public's perspective.  It would be nice to see a
proposal which also resulted in the cryptographic revealing of number
of wire taps, as an unavoidable result of the protocol.  (Not that I,
or anyone else would want to use GAK still, but it would be a gesture
of good will on the part of the GAKkers, and would show intentions not
to misuse the system.  I suggest that they would never agree to such a
system because their stated aims are untrue: they *do* want to outlaw
non-escrowed encryption for domestic US traffic, and they *do* want to
decrypt without warrants, and without public audit.  Export control
and temporarily `voluntary' GAK is a means, not an end.)

For a press worthy hack, it would be fun to extract an NSA RSA public
key from some GAKked software, and format it as a PGP key.
Then people can use key escrow if they wish (second recipient NSA).
And they can feed the NSA misinformation, stegoed data, double
encrypted PGP messages, anti GAK flames, and they might even feel
obliged to decrypt, and read it all :-)
I read some time ago about Lotus Notes which uses RSA and has GAK, was
this press release fodder, or does the product currently exist in it's
GAKked form?  Are the other GAKked products?
Is there anyone with a GAKked product, and the patience to reverse
engineer for the GAK key?
I guess if you do get an RSA key for the NSA, then you can choose an
email for them to put on the PGP keyid:
(a real working email address would be better, if that one isn't
good), and get it signed by a timestamping service (persuade the owner
to sign in the form of a key certification).

Eric Verheul  writes on cpunks:
My assumption was that a TRP is a government front.  (All of the
proposed clipper I escrow agents have been major US defense
contractors/government agencies, in addition the clipper I documents
hinted that the NSA would have a complete copy of the key database, in
any case).  I also fear that the government set regulations covering
TRPs would not be balanced in the favour of the public.  Your paper
did discuss this in the context of governments.  The US government is
the government which has explored key escrow the furthest, and this is
really why people are discussing your TTPs and TRPs in this context.
This much is the same as clipper I, just the parties have been renamed
(TRP = split escrow key database holders, TTP = US government).  The
novel part of your paper to me is your technical proposal to prevent
Blaze style spoofing of escrowed session keys.  Clipper I could have
prevented Blaze, if they had used a larger cryptographic checksum
(only 16 bits were used) to verify conformance.  However they were
relying on tamper proof hardware, your protocol works for software.
As your paper describes, your system allows anyone to check the
correctness of the escrowed session key.  Have you considered
modifying it so that the only person who can check is the owner of a
designated private key of a public/private key pair?  This would allow
say for the TTP to check correctness, and not the TRP, nor the public.
I'm not sure of the usefulness of this, but it allows you to select
from the full spectrum according to requirements:
a) no one can check, PGP second recipient (Carl Ellison, Bill Stewart)
b) recipient only can check (my suggestion)
c) holder(s) of designated keys can check
d) anyone can check (your proposal)
c) should be easy to acheive: restrict d) by having the sender encrypt
the escrowed session key a second time to this public key.
Something technical related to this discussion is the idea of using
forward secret protocols for email.  This goes even further away from
allowing others access to your data, and is another option to add to
list above, probably before a).  The current situation is that with PGP at least, the recipient can be
coerced by governments (TTPs) into decrypting the email, if he still
has the private key, as PGP keys are commonly long term having the key
is likely.  In this sense you are `escrowing' the messge with the
Using Diffie-Hellman (or a less interactive Diffie-Hellman, by using
hashes of the original Diffie-Hellman session key for subsequent
emails, an improvement over my original proposal for a non interactive
forward secrecy protocol suggested by Hal Finney) ensures that neither
you nor the recipient can be made to decrypt a wire-tapped message
unless they take specific actions to ensure this possibility.
This also allows finer control, as almost nothing is provided in terms
of recovery, and any message recovery for other parties or for
yourself can be added as required.  I would suggest adding any
recovery by archiving the data locally with encryption keys according
to the users backup, or recovery requirements.  This way any
wire-tappers get to come and ask for the data, and then ask for the
keys (neither of which the private user has any obligation to keep,
some businesses may have different legal obligations, contractual
agreements or recovery requirements, and they are free to archive this
accordingly, including taking wire-tap enabling steps such as
escrowing session keys with the message, if they wish).
OK, now if this was the case, that allowing others access to your keys
is strongly voluntary, and that you can select from key holders, and
the TRPs have no externally imposed regulation I don't have a problem.
The reason cypherpunks get touchy about `key escrow' is that we now
know that, at least in the case of the US, the intention all along was
for eventual outlawing of non-escrowed crypto.  FOIA documents
obtained by the EFF indicated that this was the plan all along.  More
recently FBI director Freeh has been quoted as saying something like
`If [clipper variants] are not succesful at catching criminals we will
consider outlawing non-escrowed crytpo'.  (This is just so bogus --
any criminal would be a complete fool to use the escrowed crypto, so
the `are not succesful at catching criminals' is almost guaranteed to
come true.  Further, even if they _do_ outlaw non-escrowed crypto,
criminals won't be using it.)  The current angle the USG plans with
the clipper variants, is to achieve as much as possible in the
direction of outlawing non-escrowed crypto by coercing companies to
sell only escrowed crypto, and so acheive their aims by de facto
I saw this as an advantage, politically I view it as preferable that
the only person who needs to know whether you are talking `on the
record' is the person you are communicating with.  (In the context of
a voluntary system, with this as a stated contractual or participatory
mutual agreement).
The padding was to be encrypted for the primary recipient along with
the message, not in the clear.  The primary recipient can already
decrypt, so having the padding adds nothing for him.
I suggested this in response to someone discussing feasibility of
software key escrow for Clipper II.  Clipper II had requirements that
the software not interoperate without modification with non-escrowed
versions.  This fulfills that requirement.
Another comment on your proposal is that although it allows anyone to
verify, it is not generally the case that anyone (other than the
recipient) is in a position to verify.  In many jurisdictions it is
illegal to intercept other peoples email.
You suggested that even if the system was voluntary, and anyone could
become a TRP, governments would have regulations granting only those
they deemed suitable the right to operate a TRP!
If this is voluntary, truly, I don't see the need for government
regulation.  Surely I personally can start a TRP, and ignore the
governemnt regulations, GAK is voluntary right, and my system isn't
GAK, this is a private contract between me and my clients, not a
government approved TRP.  Can I operate non government approved TRPs?
(I'm having a hard time thinking of any individuals who would use it
even if I did!)
The US government at least, has demonstrated all of the above.
I don't trust governments, because governments have repeatedly
demonstrated that they are not trustworthy.  I live in the UK,
mistrust of government is not a US only thing.

I agree.  However let me elaborate for Rollo: with ITAR there are at
least three aspects:
- what ITAR says
  It says for instance that you can not _talk_ to a foreign national in
  the US about crypto, that you can not show them books, that you can
  not export books etc.  We know this is not enforced (they tried it a
  few times and gave up).  We know books are allowed to be exported,
  examples: Bruce Schneier's Applied Crypto (crypto source code, never
  mind technical descriptions, which ITAR says are illegal to export
  or disclose to foreigners "Disclosing (including oral or visual
  disclosure)" Phil Zimmermann/MIT's PGP source code and internals
  book, the full source code to PGP itself in an OCR font) They don't
  enforce books or discussions anymore because of the clear 1st
  ammendment case against this behaviour.
- and what the NSA, and US government care to interpret ITAR as
  meaning today (they change to suit the case at hand, keeping their
  interpretation purposefully vague)
- what they care to enforce
  NCSA Mosaic had a PGP signature checking hook, they were told to
  take it out.  Microsoft's CAPI arrangement is that they will not
  sign non-US CAPI compliant crypto modules (Examples of enforcement of
  no-hooks interpretation).

Yes, but how would you know the TRP was telling the truth?  Also
asking the TRP is an online protocol with respect to the TRP.
The paper suggests that in one plausible implementation, the checkers
referred to could be network service providers:
from the summary of the paper posted here:
: The idea is that any third party, e.g., a network or service provider,
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: who has access to components 2, 3 and 4 (but not to any additional
: secret information) can: : a. check whether the session keys in components 2 and 3 coincide; : b. not determine any information on the actual session key.
This would allow for instance for a software only implementation of a
madatory key escrow system.  The government in question could then
deputize ISPs to do their mandatory GAK compliance checking for them.
(Deputizing companies is a recent trend in law enforcment techniques
This would allow for instance IP level encryption, with non-conforming
encrypted packets being dropped by all ISPs in the country in
question.  Something the Singaporeans might find useful.  The checking
functionality could also be added to a key escrow enabled router.
For this kind of application, binding cryptography is spot on.

As you say who cares if it's illegal: things get exported all the
The problem however, is finding a non-US site to hold the hot potato
once it has been exported.  For example 128 bit Netscape beta was
exported a while ago.  I don't see it on any non-US sites.  This is
due to Netscape's licensing requirements, you need a license to be a
netscape distribution site, the license doesn't include the right to
mirror non-exportable versions on non-US sites.
If the exported software is `PGP3.0 for CAPI' or whatever, I think it
should be fair to conclude it will be cheerfully mirrored by all, and
Phil Zimmermann won't be complaining.  (PGPfone is on ftp.ox.ac.uk,
plus other places, for example.)  So yes, I agree, for software with
appropriate distribution licenses.
Another approach, which has been discussed lately is the use of a
patch to usurp Microsoft as the signatory for CAPI modules.  I wonder
what Microsoft would say about an unauthorised patch, to fix an ITAR
induced `bug' in windows.  Bill Gates doesn't sound pro-GAK.  If they
aren't going to complain, perhaps such patches could be distributed
widely outside the US also.
The new owner of the CAPI signatory key would need a good reputation,
and presumably a policy of signing any (non-GAKked) CAPI modules
signed by microsoft, and anything else that anyone wants signed.

The problem with this is currently is that the nym servers couldn't
stand up to the scrutiny if SPA or whoever got interested.  The
message flood attack on the nym would reveal the services host.
The BlackNet architecture solves this problem by posting requests
encrypted with the services key to a newsgroup, but USENET newsgroup
disitribution time is slow (*), and people are spoilt these days with
WWW, and expect results now, not days later.
The requested file can be posted via mixmaster.  You would want to use
a different, random chain of remailers each time.  A reverse message
flood could reveal the host also, as you can request lots of copies,
and the service will blindly serve the files.  (If someone wants to
discover the service host, they send 1000s of requests, then sit back
and watch which user sends most data into the remailer net.)
To combat this the service could impose a limit on the number of
copies it would serve per day.  This allows a denial of service
attack, if someone wants to stop anyone else getting a copy, they just
saturate the service.  Still an improvement over no limit.
Of course Ross Anderson's `eternity service' provides the general case
solution for distribution of such data.  It is complex to implement
well though.

If its voluntary then "abuse" is not abuse, it is just not opting to
use the voluntary system.  Where is the problem?
The problem is that you appear to want to make those who do
voluntarily use the escrow systems non-interoperable with those who
don't.  (The USG wants this also, they can coerce big business into
offering escrow software only).
I do.  I want the information society to be free.  I want free speech.
I can not do a hit and run with words.
If some group of prudish people do not want to hear free speech, they
can hide in enclaves, pay for a censored USENET feed, etc.
If the system is voluntary, circumventing it is opting not to make use
of the voluntary key escrow.  This is by definition not a crime.
I don't undestand your point.  You give away less by letting the
recipient check than you do by letting the government (point c), or
anyone (point d) check.
This is how I envisioned it working, RSA and IDEA encryption:
Alice:  Alices public key = PK_a, Alice's secret key = SK_a
Bob:    PK_b, SK_b
Government:    PK_g, SK_g
Alice is sending Bob the message M. E_b = RSA_encrypt( PK_b, left-pad_b || session-key || right-pad_b )
E_g = RSA_encrypt( PK_g, left-pad_g || session-key || right-pad_g )
encrypted-data = IDEA_encrypt( session-key, left-pad_g || right-pad_g || M )
Alice sends Bob:
C = E_b || E_g || encrypted-data
Bob can decrypt.  He can check that the government can decrypt by
E_g = RSA_encrypt( PK_g, left-pad_g || session-key || right-pad_g )
If Alice replaces the session key in E_g with garbage, then the data
is not GAKed.  Bob will be able to detect this.  The government will
not (at least not without trying to decrypt).
It's voluntary, if it turns out that you did not use key escrow during
a warant, then the keys weren't escrowed.  This is what you get with a
voluntary system, people don't have to use it.
If you choose to allow the person who you are corresponding with to
verify that you are escrowing your keys, that is your business.
If you choose to allow the government also to check (option c, or d)
then that also is your business.  The whole system is voluntary.  I
don't see how you can arrange it any other way, and still claim that
it is a `voluntary' system.
The TTP might want to be the only checker.  With c), the TRP itself can not
check compliance.  The TRP has no information until the TTP decrypts, and
hands it the key for recovery.  This means the TTP does not have to trust
the TRP not to decrypt packets, without cooperation from the TTP.
user calculates:
E_trp = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_trp, session-key )
and sends:
E_ttp = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_ttp, random-pad || E_trp )
E_user = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_user, session-key )
(random-pad to avoid any further binding checks)
now TTP can check, by decrypting E_ttp to get E_trp, and using the
normal binding check that E_trp and E_user are encryptions of the same
session key.  The TTP sends TRP E_trp, and TRP can decrypts it, if the
request satisfies it's policies.
If the TTP further wishes that the TRP does not see the session key,
even when the TTP has cooperated with the TRP to get the key, you
could arrange key splitting:
user calculates:
session-key = session-A XOR session-B
E_trpa = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_trp, session-A )
user sends:
E_ttpa = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_ttp, random-pad || E_trpa )
E_ttpb = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_ttp, session-B )
E_usera = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_user, session-A )
E_userb = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_user, session-B )
recipient calculates:
session-A = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_usera, E_usera) session-B = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_userb, E_userb) session-key = session-A XOR session-B
TTP checks:
check = bind( E_usera, E_trpa ) AND bind( E_ttpb, E_userb )
session-A = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_ttp, E_ttpb) TRP at TTP's request:
session-B = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_trp, Etrp )

Easier.  Not so much plausible deniability.  You've got to scan your

- Stego in Internet Phone protocols.
Bill Stewart discussed some of the problems with this a short while
ago.  If I recall the basic problem is that the higher quality lossy
audio compression CODECs, which typically get used for low bandwidth
(28.8k and below modems) to get reasonable quality, don't have that
much room left, as they are compressing, and lossy, and by design
trying to leave as little as possible redundancy left.
I have also seen claims made for digital watermarking, that if enough
channels and redundancy is used, that digital watermarking survives
all kinds of abuse, analogue reproduction and redigitizing, etc.
Digital watermarking that I have seen discussed most involves image
files.  Is there any published work on digital watermarking of audio
It would be interesting to see if any audio watermarking techniques

the two aims are in tension: stego is trying to make the fact that the
data is there at all undetectable, the main aim with watermarking is
that you not be able to remove all traces of watermarking, and the way
that this is achieved is to spread the watermarking through many
channels.  The fact that there is watermarking in the document is not
necessarily being concealed, the primary aim is to stop removal, and
encode the watermark so that the image is not appreciably damaged

The recent discussion on using IDEA with larger keys, or using 3IDEA
(triple IDEA) might be one way to get larger key spaces.
Peter Gutmann's MDC or the Luby-Rackoff method for constructing a CBC
mode block cipher from hash functions are another way.  However,
Schneier, in AC2 voices concerns about basing ciphers on hashes
because the design goals for hashes are different from those for
symmetric ciphers.
I would be interested to discuss the options of combining
cryptosystems so that the resulting cipher is as strong as the
strongest of the used ciphers.
For instance ways to combine IDEA, 3DES, and MDC say, such that all 3
have to be thoroughly broken before the combination is broken.
How good is simple multiple encryption:
The same question for public key, how good is:
mixing in a PK system based on a hard problem other than one based on
discrete logs / factoring would be nice also, in case there turn out
to be problems in this area.
Also Schneier has this one:
generate a one-time pad P, XOR it with the data M, then:
generating the pad is left as an exercise to the reader (just
remember, you need at least 112 + 128 bits of security).
Also this has the problem that it doubles the message size, but it is
guaranteed to be as hard to break as breaking both IDEA and 3DES (or
whatever algorithms it is you are using).
Also another problem for all of this, you need really top quality
random number generators, to get full use from your long key length

You do save something: you only need one key schedule per key that you
try.  You can try the key against multiple ciphertexts.
A negative effect is that you might loose cacheing opportunities as
code and data are increased.
For timings you're likely to get for DES, you suffer from the law of
diminishing returns quickly, and the additional keys/sec from doing
more keys tapers off asymptotically.
The number of keys it would be most efficient to use (say where adding
another key speeds things up by less than 1%, or whatever) hinges
heavily on the actual balance between how fast the key schedule can be
made to go as compared to a CBC block operation (or whatever mode
you're attacking).  Also the protocol you are attacking, and the
position of the known plaintext in this block affects things greatly,
the further along the plaintext, the more blocks you have to cycle
through, and more data you have to move around.
To illustrate the effect, here's some quick cacluations based (loosly)
on the timings being quoted.
With Peter Trei's projected DES block timing from pentium 90 to
pentium 133, and approximate equivalence of ecb and cbc demonstrated
by Eric's code (this set of figures is hand-waving: I'm not at all
sure like is being compared with like, and we are now extrapolating
from extrapolations), combining with Eric's keyschedule timing:
keyschedule 12.2us (Eric Young's) DES cbc block = 0.47us (from Peter Trei's extrapolated pentium 133Mhz)

Account transfers was what I had in mind also, the higher value
transactions that they are used for, and the more widely used the
better.  So being able to break the authentication on transmission
message protocols, might be enough, if being able to forge the
authenticed payment transfer requests would be possible.
Any protocols you can point us to involving inter-bank or
international transfers would be great, if there are any which are
still using DES rather than 3DES.
Hope these protocols use include known plaintext, either fixed message
parts, or predictable (account numbers), or use an integrity check
which we can also (ab)use.  (Netscape's SSL used (is this still
present in SSL3.0?) such an integrity check and this was the toe hold
for the SSL brute force.)
(As a fall back, ATMs might be useful if the protocol used the same
key to encrypt all PINs.  However, one might hope that the protocols
use diferent DES keys for different PINs.)
Some time ago, there was a Russian guy with some other accoplices who
got caught transferring several millions out of some US banks, this

pieces of software:
Additional subdomains can be allocated for other services, e.g.

Current email and packet delivery protocols (A records and MX records)
permit us to offer a large set of potential machines to which
anonymous email would be delivered, at random, all under the same
domain name.  Each of these machines would have to be able to properly
route mail for any email address in the anonymous.net domain.  This
would avoid denial of service by shutting down any particular remailer
machine, as long as at least one advertised remailer remained up.  The
domain records themselves (for anonymous.net), which list the set of
advertised remailers, can also be replicated on numerous hosts to make
them harder to censor.
Having replicated, random entry point machines would also make it
harder to trace any specific message unless all the entry point
messages were tapped by an attacker.  The message they care about
might go through some entry point that wasn't tapped.
I'm willing to hold the domain name and defend it, but am too busy
to do any of the protocol design or technical work required.

I like the idea of a more secure and resilient replacement for penet.
There are significant design problems to iron out if the result is to
provide good anonymity.
The implementation is tricky to do in a fashion which is secure, fault
tolerant, and scalable.  This would seem to be one of those "pick any
2" type problems where the design criteria conflict.  Perhaps we
should also add low bandwidth requirements for the user, resilience to
DoS (Denial of Service), and resilience to abuse by spammers.
would contain the encrypted reply?  Encrypted reply blocks get big
even for a few hops, with PGP & type I remailers.
Chaining as a general method for creating reply blocks (such as the
alpha nymserver), is not that secure because a) it's using type I
remailers where messages with differing sizes show through, and b)
it's open to the replay, or flood attack.
Mixmaster has some nice improvements over type I remailers: fixed size
blocks, forward secrecy (not implemented yet), anti replay code.
However the anti-replay code means you can't use it directly for reply
blocks, and if you disabled that feature, you'd be open to the
flooding attack.
Combining mixmaster with message pools seems the most secure current
option.  This does have inconvenience in terms of the bandwidth
requirements of the user -- lots of people have got to download the
whole pool, or have unlogged local access to a newspool, or have a
broadcast newsfeed.  Also it reduces scalability, everyone gets all
All nice things, but lets talk about one thing at a time,
anonymous.net email addresses first!
OK, so you could use multiple DNS entries to pick a machine at
This level of resilience seems to imply that there is only one
remailer key, and that each remailer could decrypt all the remailer
traffic.  This would be as trustworthy as the least trustworthy
remailer.  (That will be the one owned by the NSA front).  Very
resilient but not very secure.
Perhaps you mean instead that the anonymous.net domain replicators do
not do remailing as such, they just provide the anonymous.net address,
and route the message to the appropriate remailer.  If you mean this,
then you have lots of protection for the forwarders, and as long as
one is left your mail gets forwarded to the correct remailer.  However
you still have problems of resilience of the actual remailers, if any
remailer on your chain breaks, so does youre reply block.
You could trade off security for resilience by having multiple reply
Another approach may be to secret share a single group remailer
private key.  Have a threshold of remailers needed to decrypt.  Each
remailer part decrypts, and passes on to another remailer, eventually
the remail instruction is decrypted, and the message is sent to the
recipient.  Unfortunately, if the NSA owned remailers ever get
sufficient in proportion the system would be broken whenever an NSA
remailer was chosen as an entry point.  (This assumes you also encrypt
communications between remailers with a remailer specific key, or a DH
negotiated key.)
There are signature schemes which allow signatures to be made with a
secret shared key without revealing the shares.  (Each share holder
adds a partial signature, up to the threshold when a full signature is
generated).  Are there algorithms which can do the same thing for
decrypting, so that we could have remailers adding partial decrypts?
Are there algorithms to generate a public/private key pair such that
no one ever needs to be trusted to do the split without keeping the

Not seen it either.
2048 bit PGP signatory key, long passphrase conventional encryption.
If you are doubtful of the entropy of the passphrase you could encrypt
with a second PGP public key signed by the first, and simply reveal
the secret key.
Post the message to cypherpunks via a nice long chain of mixmaster
remailers.  (Then you can't be coerced into releasing the key early).
Spoofing is difficult to prevent because anyone can repeat what you
are doing, publish a key, publish the explanatory text and encrypted
message, then post the decrypt key later.
With Tim May's BlackNet key, there were several after the fact
attempted spoofs of it, people publishing other keys with "BlackNet"
as the key id, as a kind of denial of service attack.
Getting a timestamp from a PGP timestamping service on the key, and
also having the encrypted message and explanatory text timestamped
before releasing it would help.  Then people couldn't spoof unless
they knew before hand what kind of topic your release would be about,
so that they could pre-sign a selection to pick from as a spoof.

@_subject: Netescrow & Remailers? 
As Adam (Shostack) suggested, and also as discussed by John Gilmore in
response (on coderpunks) to my reply to his "anonymous.net" proposal,
MX records provide a way to do this.
John was talking about using "remailer at mail.anonymous.net" as a single
entry point into the remailers in general, with multiple MX records
meaning that the mail would go to random actual remailers.  The
remailer would then forward to the correct remailer.
Also suggested was "remailer at 1234.mail.anonymous.net", which would
again me MXed to a particular remailer.  The same technique would
allow MX records to point to remailers by name rather than being
numbered.  Your Alice becomes using MX forwarding (or remailer at alice.alias.net, the other domain
used for remailer MX redirection).
And of course the nice thing about MX records (and A records) is that
they have TTLs (Time To Live) which when set appropriately means that
they can be made to point at different IP addresses at the drop of a
hat.  And the old email address works as before (once you've also
reallocated the key).
I was thinking of the same idea, of reallocating keys, and one issue
which did occur to me, is that when remailer Alice goes off-line this
is as like as not to be the result of some law enforecement (LE)
interference.  If the LEs also happen to own a few remailers, they may
`encourage' the remailer operator to hand over the key to one of their
own remailers.
It might be nice if the attacked remailer was able to hand the keys to
a random other remailer, in such a way that it was publically
verifiable that the selection was random, and verifiable as to which
remailer got the key.  (The remaining remailers engage in a publically
verifiable cryptographic selection of straws, the shortest straw gets
the key).  Naturally there is nothing to stop any given remailer giving the key
away to all and sundry, and nothing to stop the spooks starting lots
of remailers.
Also if the spooks own more than half the remailers the above may be
worse than the remailer owner giving the key to a trusted friend.
Another approach would be for the remailer to release a timestamped
hash of it's key reallocation policy.  When the remailer is
decomissioned, this will allow people to see that it is adhering to
it's stated policy.  (The policy could specify a verifiable random
selection from a list of remailers selected by the owner).
However I think it is nice to know when there is increased likelihood
of spook interference that the reallocated key gets a fair chance of
being redistributed to a non spook remailer, or according to the
owner's uncoerced wishes.
Also it is nice to know which remailers are run on the same machine,
and/or owned by the same operator, if for no other reason, than to
allow you to take this into account when generating your chains.  I
notice Raph's reliable remailer list includes this information where
it is known:
: Groups of remailers sharing a machine or operator:
: (cyber mix)
: (weasel squirrel)
These remailers are of less value when used together in a chain, in
the case of security compromise on the machine, or operator coercion,
than remailers with different operators.  This kind of information is
valuable just as the remailers other attributes are: the remailers
jurisdiction, and the owner's usage policy.
Matts Kallioniemi  reminded us, of a point made
in early rehashes, that we really need disposable last hop remailers.
The interesting point he made, which I had not seen made before, is
that exit remailers could refuse to remail to other remailers, to
discourage use in reply blocks, or at least a tag "exit" could be
added to the Raphs remailer capability list, so that people know that
these remailers are likely to take the heat.
The converse, specifically non-exit remailers, there exists only one
example that I have seen advertised, "middleman". Matts' suggestion of
having all remailers either "exitmen" or "middlemen", seems like a
good idea.
However there are other reasons remailers shut down at short notice,
(other than being attacked by LEs, or having legal threats made).
Amongst these we've seen:
- "sorry folks, I'm taking my laptop on holiday"
- "sorry, remailers keys lost in disk crash, heres a new key"
- "my ISP is shutting down"
- "shut down due to abuse"
- "sorry remailer key compromised"
plus no doubt many temporary outages caused by machine reboots,
network outages, software upgrades, rebooting a linux machine to DOS
to for a while, etc.
It would be really nice if remailers could be made completely
Tom Cross  described an idea in the
remailer thread on coderpunks.  His idea was to have the remailers in
a DC net, and have pseudonym servers as the DC net nodes.  He also had
redundant secret sharing for the pseudonym <-> reply block database,
to provide resilence to individual DC net nodes bowing out.  This
prevents attacks on the pseudonym server (coercing the pseudonym
server to delete a particular pseudonym and it's reply block), but
doesn't say anything about the resilence of the reply block itself to
remailers in the chain disappearing.
A method relying on DC nets would be for the nym owner to create a
single hop reply block, and secret share this reply block over the DC
net nodes.  If a request is sent to any DC net node, provided that the
required k of n share holders remain, the reply address can be
retrieved.  You would need to ensure that the reconstruction of
recipients address did not reveal shares.

SHA1 sig capability included.
Ordinarily you'd think that there would be a rush to put out a new
version of PGP (Say PGP versions 2.6.4 and 2.6.4i respectively for MIT
and Stale Schaumaker's interational version).
However, I'm not sure of the status of further pgp2.6.x versions.
PGPlib (aka pgp3) is supposed to be being released RSN.  PGP Inc was
formed earlier this year.  Initially PGP Inc made noises about
litigation over ViaCrypts incorporation of commercial key escrow in
some viacrypt versions.  Then PGP Inc bought ViaCrypt and it's parent
company, to regain the distribution rights sold to ViaCrypt.
The people working on pgp3 are doing so as employees of companies, I'm
not sure at what point development switched from freeware to
commercial, but at this point my understanding is that Derek Atkins is
employed by SGI, and Colin Plumb by PGP Inc.  Some time ago when there
was a question about which companies were crypto friendly on the list,
SGI was listed because they were paying Derek to work on pgp3.  One
presumes this arrangement started before PGP Inc incorporated.
Other people at PGP are also working on pgp3 (Hal Finney, who recently
started work at PGP Inc, said that he was in a recent list post).
I believe Phil Zimmermann made an announcement earlier this year
(probably on this list, but perhaps in a USENET group, I forget), that
his lawyers were advising him to discourage other people from using
the `PGP' name.
MIT is distributing pgp2.6.2, and PGPfone also.  MIT seems to be
involved as a distribution site at least.
Also I understand, though there appears to be no available
documentation saying as much, that pgp3.0 will not use RSA, nor IDEA,
nor MD5, using instead El Gamal for public key encryption and
signatures, 3DES (unsure?), and SHA1.
Several people have made pointed comments about the delivery time of
pgp3, about the danger of S/MIME getting ahead before pgp3 is
released.  Several people have opined that there would surely be many
people willing to help.  I suspect however that the offers of help may
be complicated by the commercial nature of pgp3.
Also in conversation I hear rumors that there are companies at the
moment who have access to beta versions of pgp3.  Is this so?  And if
so, might cypherpunks also be considered?
As I understand it pgp3 will be available in source form, and will be
available without charge for academic and personal use.  People who
pay for PGP will get shrink wrap, manuals and use of PGPs tech support
However, I am not sure what pgp3 includes...  Derek's most recent post

It's highly bogus, I'm sure, but what they seem to be doing is
allowing strong encryption for very small messages.  (eg SET, and at
least one other example I'm aware of)  Of course users could
manufacture hundreds of bogus small messages to produce one large
message.  But then they could probably also find multiple examples of
low bandwidth subliminal channels in the protocl/algorithms, and if
they're willing to use their own software they could use PGP anyway.
If it's anything like ITAR it will be decied on a case-by-case basis,
and they'll only give you permission if you conform to undisclosed,
and continually changing NSA internal policies.  Or perhaps it's just
if on their whim, it'd be difficult to distinguish.
The actual agenda as always is to discourage use of strong crypto both
inside and outside the US.

@_subject: strengthening remailer protocols 
Peter Allan  writes on cpunks:
The attack Peter is hoping to frustrate is as follows: target message
being sent from Alice to Bob through remailer R.  The attacker in an
active `spam' attack floods remailer R so that he will recognize the
target message and it's destination.
Another approach to making the transmitted message unrecognizable to
it's owner would be to finish the implementation of D-H key exchange
in mixmaster.  (The version I am looking at (2.0.3) does not have the
D-H key exchange and direct socket communication implemented, rather
it delivers mail by sendmail, I believe).
As a bonus this provides forward secrecy, so that not even a supeonaed
remailer operator would be able to reconstruct the destination.
You can still do a spamming attack by recognizing the destination,
rather than the message: Eve forwards enough messages to remailer R to
flush the target message.  Each of Eves messages is headed to a known
(to Eve) address.  Say the remailer R has a buffer of 10 messages, if
Eve sends 9 messages, 3 to each of remailers R2, R3, and R4.  Eve can
then determine the destination of the target message: the remailer
which gets 4 messages is the destination remailer.
(Here my knowledge of mixmasters workings are wearing thin, but I
believe it does these things, or provides facilities so that the
operators/users can make sure these things happen).
The way that this kind of attack is frustrated is that dummy messages
are created as cover traffic by the remailer, and that at some points
messages can be swallowed by a remailer as junk messages.
Sufficient junk cover traffic would ensure that even with a spamming
attack the destination would not be known immediately because the
attacker can distinguish the target message from the junk.
Ultimately a good way to foil this attack in general is to have each
remailer send a fixed amount of mail to each other remailer in cycles.
No traffic analysis if all remailers get equal traffic.
The only entry point for analysis then is the entry and exit points.
The active spam attack then would be to block, or delay all entry
points into the remailer net, apart from the target message.  The only
messages in the network would then be the spam traffic, and the target
message.  When the target message leaves the net, the Eve knows the
To hinder this attack, the remailers could generate and mail to
previous users junk mail.  Over a long time, statistical attacks could
perhaps be built on a pair of users who communicated frequently.  The
ultimate solution to this is for the users also to receive fixed
amounts of junk each day.
Starting to sound like similar overheads to a DC net, huh?
Peters other suggestions of adding random diversions sound like
reasonable ways to add another form of cover traffic, and should help
make life harder for the attacker,

No.  But I too am rather suprised to hear an EFF board member
apparently speaking against free speech.  OK, so maybe she was
mis-quoted so I wait for her rebuttal, but nope, she basically to my
reading reiterates nothing but negative opinions on free speech and
Tim's quotes of her CFP speech further demonstrates her leanings.
Lets put it this way: if Louis Freeh offered to be an EFF board
member, would you take him on board?  If he seemed quite
pro-anonymity, and free speech, and later turned out to be having
doubts, would you keep him?
Ie if her views are proving a liability for EFFs reputation, perhaps
you all ought to get together and see if you can work something out?
Anonymity is a pretty darn major issue here, so it'd be really sad to
see EFF coming down on the wrong side.  I've seen some of the other
EFF insiders own opinions, and would like to see them adopted in place
of Dyson's views, which whether they are her opinion or not, are more
likely to get misrepresented by the press as such, in face of a lack
of an EFF position.  EPICs statement looked a reasonable start.
She sounded pretty anti-anonymity to me.
Are there a shortage of political and net-aware libertarians for board
candidates or something?
Perhaps the quote was unfortunate, perhaps she has also said
pro-anonymity things.  But a person who is pro-anonymity would surely
try to emphasise the pro arguments also?  The material I have seen so
far does not seem to indicate that this is the case.
If this is the case she needs to be _much_ more careful about what she
says in `personal' interviews.
Be sure to express the pro-anonymity arguments while you're zealously
hammering out every last thing that can go wrong with anonymity: like
that free speech is not possible with out it.  It's pretty much all or
nothing, either you think free speech is worth the risk, or you prefer
big brother, government access to keys, the works.

the price for removing anonymity is the price of loosing strongly free

you can say what you want provided you provide your ID up front to the

that someone somewhere in some region of the world finds mildly

involve GAK, outlawing of non-GAKed crypto, placing import
restrictions on crypto (I saw Freeh quoted as saying that restricting

years ago) draconian thought police laws, and so on.
It's quite simple to envisage: place yourself in the position of the
overzealous law enforcement type, imagine you are tasked with
elminating encryption, free speech on the internet, anonymity.  So
what're you going do?  First thing you might notice is that pretty
near everyone is against you.  So you work up a few four horseman
scare stories, try to squelch all the first ammendment based
challenges in the courts, do a few oblique trade-offs with companies
exchanging key escrow for more bits, maybe blow up a few airplanes,
and federal buildings and blame it on `militias', and the Internet.
Rant about the Internet at each opportunity whether has anything to do
with it or not (did the perps even know anyone with internet access,
do they have a distant cousin who does, there must be an angle
somewhere, or heck who cares, just shout about the Internet anyway,
no one'll notice it's nothing to do with it).  You realise that you're
going to have to get pretty mean to actually stamp out free speech for
all these people with a quaint wish to uphold the constitution, and

So it seems.  If she has little to say on civil liberties, perhaps she
should refrain.  William Geiger  corrected me in
this thread, his reading is that Dyson's interview was not a personal
interview, she was being interviewd _as_ an EFF board member, she just
chose to make a personal statement in it.  If this is the case I
submit the correct comment on her part would have been that the EFF
had no current position on the topic.
Personally I think I'm better at coding, than constructing convincing
arguments.  But for what it's worth here's a few.  I doubt they are
news to you, but since you kind of asked:
Tim's cyphernomicon isn't short but should be a required reading, IMO.
The US constitutional protections for free speech?
The Singaporean demonstration of the alternative?
The principle of having laws against crimes, not against the potential
means of comitting crimes.  You know, you can't carry a knife, why
not?  Because you might commit a crime.  So why not wait see if you do
commit a crime.  You could just as easily stab someone with a screw
driver, so what now, outlaw carrying of screw drivers, have permits to
carry a screw driver?  Sad fact is you can probably get successfully
prosecuted for carrying a screw driver if you can't demonstrate a need
to carry one already.  You see where this line of reasoning heads.  It
is ultimately useless to make it illegal for people to have any means
to commit crimes.  Crimes with victims are already illegal, we don't
need anymore laws, we've got way too many already.  If someone goes
out and murders someone, the police attempt to catch the murderer to
prevent further murders.  We don't need dumb laws outlawing cars (so
the guy can't drive away from the scene?), knives, guns, the internet
(in case he plots to off someone), the phone system in case he uses
that, pay phones in case he uses one of those, what comes next, you
know?  Several things which were proposed in jest by cypherpunks which
were thought too outlandish to be next in line for banning, were
actually seriously proposed and even implemented.  It never ceases to
amaze me the things the law enforcement types think up.
Perhaps when the technology is up to it we ought to just implant a CCD
chip behind newborn's eyeballs, and have a life escrow system to just
record ever last second of everyones existance just in case they have
the urge to drive over 55, or not divulge their true name, social
security number, address etc. in a casual electronic conversation.
yay :-)
Now all you need to do is have an official policy that says so, so
that board members who are less clear on the subject, can quote that
policy rather than discussing their own opinions :-)

@_subject: Job for netescrow ? (was Secure anonymouse server protocol... 
Peter Allan  writes on cpunks:
Just to clarify, if I understand correctly you are proposing a penet
style system with the database held in `netescrow'.
The remailer in normal operation has access to the database by making
requests satisfying the conditions of the secret share holders.
When the remailer is compromised the memory resident key is lost when
the machine is switched off, and the owner refuses to release the key.
Is what you are proposing?
It sounds like a cross between Matt's netescrow and Ross Anderson's
eternity file system.  Your penet database is being stored in a
distributed file system, with shares, and the identity of the share
holders is concealed.  However the aim is not to prevent others
censoring your publically available writings, but to allow a second
avenue of access only in the case of `mob cryptography'.
This changes the system over storing the database encrypted on the
remailer machines own disk in these ways:
1.  When the police shut down the remailer and ask the
    operator to hand over the key he can decline, but they
    can (theoretically) get the database from the netescrow,
    if they can convince enough share holders.
    If the police are unsucessful (seems likely) does this offer the
    operator much solice in his jail time for contempt of court, to
    know that he has a vote of confidence in the moral correctness of
    his decision from a population of the net?
    Does it offer him any legal benefit?  Are the share holders guilty
    of contempt also, does this lessen his guilt, and harshness of
    prosecution?  (Remember that the share holders identity and
    location are unkown to the operator, in the netescrow model, if I
    remeber rightly).
    I'm not sure how useful this part is, unless the possibility of
    `mob cryptography' is the desired feature.  I'd have thought an
    individual remailer operator would be more likely to fold than a
    group of anonymous crypto-anarchists.
2.  You could add the twist of an alternative duress key, that would
    stand a real chance of successfully nuking the database.  More
    satisfying.
3.  Negative comment on the system: TLAs have a vested interest in
    themselves being most of the share holders.  True of the ownership
    of the current remailers also of course.
Is the aim of allowing `mob cryptography' the desired feature?
If so this is NAK, `Net Access to Keys'.
Fine by me, as long as it's strongly voluntary :-)  (And hence useless
for it's forced access purposes).
NAK, is interesting in that it puts things to a vote, where the
parties are anonymous, they are on the net, so it's a Net
constitutency that gets to vote.  It seems less evil than GAK.
However I still have problems with it:
problem 1: subterfuge by TLAs, they'll try to become share holders in
a big way, and preventing them from doing this seems difficult without
Chaumian style is-a-person credentials, to prevent multiple voting.
Even with is-a-person TLAs would then target the credential issuer.
(Much the same as the TLAs are able to create fake credit histories,
identities, and so on currently).  Unless there is a way to do a
decentralised web of trust implementation of an `is a person'
credential in such a way that it is difficult for TLAs to target.
Perhaps it would be simpler to require a certain amount of ecash be
paid as a vote, set it high enough that no one can afford to abuse it,
TLAs included.
problem 2: free speech is free speech even if it's unpopular.  The
tyranny of the majority problem.  Non-voluntary NAK forces peer review
on every one, and just because some peoples views rate badly in a lot
of peoples eyes, doesn't mean they should be punished.
Perhaps this problem can be mitigated by constructing the shares such
that 99% of `is a person' checked votes certifying that they believe
they have evidence that the nym in question is in the throws of nuking
a major city for a ransom.
So what do cpunks think of Matt's `Oblivious Key Escrow', formulated
as NAK coupled with either is-a-person, or pay per vote to eliminate
the multiple voter problem.
It would force accountability and openess on our spooks, they have to
explain, document clearly, or at least present some real convincing
At the same time it would provide an argument against GAK, all
legitimate (in the publics eyes, what other opinions count, this is a
democracy isn't it) law enforcement needs met.
However these advantages are balanced against the tyranny of the
majority problem, which is better than tyranny by unaccountable TLAs,
but still a problem,

@_subject: forward secrecy in mixmaster 
Since Peter Allen's discussion of mixmaster, I started doing something
I'd been thinking of for a while, since noticing that it was on the
mixmaster to-do list months ago (ie there is unfinished source to do
this): direct socket connections and diffie-hellman key exchange for
forward secrecy.
I wrote the socket stuff yesterday evening, didn't take too long as
socket programming is something I've done lots of.
Now comes what do you actually send down the sockets.
Question for Lance, and any others who were involved in mixmasters
implementation: what did you have in mind as a way of negotiating the
DH keys?
I notice that mixmaster generates a DH key and stores it in file
`DH.mix', but that this is not (as far as I can see from the source)
included in the remailers public key block.
(A couple of comments as an aside: I think that you should be able to
have a much smaller generator without loss of security, this should
reduce the overhead of a DH key exchange.  Using 3 even I think is
safe, without any extra precautions on prime generation.  You can even
go to 2, with a few precautions (PGPfone does this).  Comment  I
think 1024 may be a bit small, I don't have any figures handy for
relative security of DH key lengths, but PGPfone offers 4096 bit DH
for instance.  Does rsaref have limits on prime lengths for DH, the
same as it does for RSA?).
There are lots of options for DH public key negotiation.
First option is whether you have a common prime and generator for all
remailers or not.  If you have a common prime, accusations of the
prime being `cooked' (chosen to have a weakness) can be mitigated by
using a deterministic generation method based on the hash of a known
phrase (a Jefferson quote perhaps), or PI or whatever.
A common modulus may offer a fatter target for attack (for some
precomputation attacks), but with large enough keys this probably
isn't that bad, as there aren't that many mixmasters anyway.
With a common modulus there is DH key negotiation needed, just include
it with the source.
For different modulii for each remailer, there are more options:
a) include the DH key signed by the RSA key in the remailers public key
   (may break backwards compatibility with existing versions of
   mixmaster)
b) send the DH public key at the start of each session
c) send the DH public key on request
There is also a question of which key do you use, the sender remailers
or the recipient remailers.
Negotiating DH public keys during execution also opens the possibility
for periodic re-keying.
Thats the end of my thoughts on direct socket mixmaster.

@_subject: non-interactive forward secrecy 
[This discussion is driven by the desirability of having forward
secrecy in mixmaster for the mix packets delivered by email where the
interactive nature of normal DH is incovenient]
Anyone have any ideas for a non-interactive forward secrecy protocol?
Aside from actually doing the DH key exchange via email (painful), I
have one suggestion for a protocol, perhaps people can improve on
Assuming common prime p, and generator g:
Two remailers A and B.  A wants to send messages to B without having to
wait for replies from B.
B generates ys (y0,y1,...,yn), then computes Ys (Y0,Y1,...,Yn)
B sends A Ys, and discards ys.
Now A can send B n consecutive packets with forward secrecy before
receiving any more packets from B.
(B keeps y0, and overwrites it with y1 = hash(y0), etc, so that all B
ever has to hand is the current y(i), and y(i-1) is hard to compute
from y(i) because of the hash functions properties.)
This isn't truly non-interactive, it just reduces the number of
interactions, to an interactive exchange in 1 out of n cases.
(you could randomly chose ys rather than having related ys, and delete
y(i) after use, but this has higher storage requirements (n rather
than 1 on the recipient)).
Heres the obvious construction for a truly non-interactive forward
secrecy protocol based on DH.  (That is it only requires 1
interactive exchange).
Aside from the obvious of having a huge n, and the above protocol,
which would have large space requirements, what we're after is a way
to do this with negligable space requirements.
Say that we have the two parties Alice and Bob.  Bob doesn't loose
much by having his secret (x) related as above.
1.	x(i+1) = f1( x(i) )
2.	X(i+1) = f2( X(i) )
3.      f1 is non reversible
f1 should have hash-like properties (it should be non-reversible).
Do functions f1 and f2 satisfying 1, 2 and 3 exist?  Is there another
way to achieve this?
(My closest attempt so far, based on the hardness of discrete square roots:
doesn't work because g^(x^2 mod p) mod p != g^(x^2) mod p)

@_subject: forward secrecy in mixmaster 
Lance Cottrell  writes on several lists:
Well the first DH parameter set (in a series of re-keyed DH
parameters) could just as easily go in the public key block.  If you
were not doing rekeying, it would make sense to put the public DH
parameters in the key block, as it would remove the need to negotiate
these parameters, and simplify the protocol.  As you're doing
rekeying, putting the parameters in the public key block makes a less
orthogonal protocol, adds nothing, and has the negative effect of
breaking compatibility with previous public key blocks.  In short for
a rekeying protocol I agree :-)
Fair enough.
I suspected RSAs weird license might be the problem.  (Given the
situation with PGP 2.x, I presume that the license does not permit you
to increase the max arithmetic precision.)
Each remailer with it's own prime doesn't buy you a whole lot of
entropy because there aren't many mixmaster remailers, 4 bits
currently?.  The entropy from having rekeying every day instead of say
every year, another 9 bits, 13 bits tops?  I'm not sure what the
precise entropy increase is from going to 1024 to 4096, but it's got
to be many orders of magnitude better than 13 bits.
I'd say junk RSAREF for the DH operations, use one of the other libs.
(You can do this for DH, without violating patents, right?  But not
for RSA, so I guess if you care about the patent/license agreement
mess, you've got to use RSAREF for RSA signatures at least).  Or maybe
you could just wait for PGP 3.0 which uses El Gamal, for sigs and pk
encryption, and presumably will have less restrictive key sizes.
So as well as having bigger signing keys, for the sake of paranoia
(it's contagious), as you were saying, I guess you may gain some
security by not having a common modulus, and making the protocol allow
If you used a different password for RSA and DH keys, and your machine
is compromised, you can sign a new DH key with RSA, and use El Gamal
signatures with the DH key normally.  Hows that for paranoid :-)
(Or another temporary RSA key, and RSA sigs, rather than El Gamal
sigs, whatever.  You sign by proxy, that is the receiver mixmaster
gets a the temporary key signed by the long term RSA key, checks the
signature on the temporary key, and then checks the signature made by
the temporary key on the object in question).
Greatly reduces the risk of having the password in the binary.  You'd
need to manually type the RSA keys password to rekey, or if you were
real paranoid, you could keep the RSA key on your laptop, and copy the
new signed DH public key on to the remailer.  Do this once a month, or
as often as you wish.
This is a similar approach to that taken by people who have a huge
signing only PGP key, which they are careful to keep only on machines
they physically control, and have smaller keys which they use on
multi-user systems.
This also formalizes the situation where remailers have been
compromised, or suffered disk crashes.  The operator says, "sorry
folks new type2 key for mixmaster at xyz.org", and if you're lucky signs
his post, and also his post of the original key, so that you know it's
not a hijacker, and if you're even more lucky, the user was around
when the first post was made, or searches through the archives for it,
and checks that the sigs show a persistent identity for the operator.
An improvement right?  The remailers keep both their signing keys, and
their temporary signing keys available by request, the signing key
should not change through the remailers life-time.
yeah, ok, I agree no common modulus.  And rekeying.
sounds fine.
Also, you might want to migrate to SHA1 in place of MD5, at some
point.  Or to one of those megahashes like
Also mixmaster has capabilities like type 1 remailers right?  If so
you would presumably add a capability indicating that the remailer
supports direct socket delivery.  And another capability for forward
secrecy (the other thread "non-interactive forward secrecy" discusses
ways to retro-fit a less interactive forward secrecy mechanism into
email delivered mixmaster packets).
The socket capability presumably would be useful to know that it is
likely to react more quickly.  Forward secrecy is obviously nice to
know about for other reasons.

the approach described is to have anonymous servers with secret shared

they are accessing, or even to an attacker who is monitoring net
traffic.  The user wants to hide which sites they are accessing, and
what information they are accessing.  No attempt is made to conceal
the identity of the www sites accessed, a normal URL is used to access
them.  This is basically just like  except that
traffic is routed over the mixmaster net.
An http <-> mixmaster interface would be added to the existing
mixmaster.  You add a blip in the line for outgoing traffic on your
own machine which converts all outgoing http requests into mixmaster
packets and feeds them into the remailer network.  You choose random
chains to get to the http servers.  The delivered packet at the exit
remailer node is a new mixmaster packet type, a http request type,
rather than a request to email to an individual, or post to a
newsgroup, it results in an (where possible SSL encrypted) http
request being made to the specified http server.
Also included with the request is a mixmaster reply chain, so that the
exit mixmaster node can route the return the requested www pages, and
SSL session traffic back to the originator.
As you might imagine if this became popular, it could generate a lot
of traffic.  For a practical system I think it's inevitable that you'd
need to provide some financial incentive for the mixmaster operators
to subsidize their T3s :-) So you would need to incorporate per hop
payments, for the remailers.  This could be a relatively small payment,
but is just there to ensure that they have the money to increase their
bandwidth if the demand requires it.
I think that about explains part 1.
2. an eternity like system built on this system
There are a couple of extra requirements for the eternity system,
firstly that the address of the www site must be concealed also, and
secondly that the data is secret shared across multiple eternity www
The first requirement can be met by the anonymous eternity www sites
publically posting to a newsgroup (via a mixmaster remailer of
course:-) a mixmaster chain pointing at themselves.
To reduce the problem of the flood attack for finding the endpoint of
a chain, firstly some of Peter Allan's suggestions on extra cover
traffic, and on adding extra hops to increase cover traffic should
help, but ultimately this only makes a longer concerted flood
necessary to find the output.
I don't see any easy solution to the flood attack, the only _real_
answer is a DC net.  A slightly simpler, but less robust solution
would be to find ways to have fixed levels of traffic between nodes in
the remailer network.  Surplus traffic at entry points could be
rejected, so that the sender knows to try another remailer.
The other requirement for eternity is that the data should be secret
If all the eternity www servers publish their reply blocks, the user
sends requests to a number of the eternity servers selected randomly.
Choose the number so that it is likely that you will get the required
k of n shares, given that there are n servers, and they all hold
shares in the data, and that k of n shares are required to recover the
You also need to ensure that the exit mixmaster which is acting as a
http forwarder server can't tell whether it is making an eternity
system request or an anonymous www proxy request.  The fact that http
traffic is blindly forwarded means that if the http request is SSL
encrypted the http forwarding mixmaster remailer will not know the
contents of the traffic, and so will not be able to distinguish
traffic type: eternity or anonymous proxy.
As the eternity www servers don't know what the data in the shares
they are holding is, they can't provide the indexing facility
directly.  Rather ordinary www pages, and other eternity www pages can
be used to collect links to interesting eternity pages.  In
otherwords, it's decentralised, as is the www, and any indexing left
up to the authors of eternity hosted www documents, or anyone elses
indexing to interesting links.
A compromise technology which would greatly simplify access to the
service would be public www proxies or gateways to the eternity
service, so that no new software was required for the client.  This
would serve a similar role to WWW based remailers.
The scheme is complex in places but basically requires no new
technology, at least for a crude implementation, without the finer
What can be missed out in a first pass implementation, and deferred
for later incremental improvements:

Hadn't heard that before, that the trade secret requirement was

interesting assertion on the part of RSADSI, and I am intrigued.
Some people held that it had been a licensed holder of RC4 source who
had posted it in violation of the license agreement.  I think I recall
that Tim May, may be others, argued this nearer the time.
That the code looked different isn't of itself proof that it was or
wasn't reverse engineered; it is entirely plausible for the anonymous
poster (if it was a source license violation) to have gone to some
pains to obscure this fact, by changing the appearance and style of
the code.
You ought to reference Andrew Roos paper [posted to the list, and
sci.crypt, at least] analysing key schedule biases in RC4.  Paul
Kocher posted a response (this was in sci.crypt) saying that he had
discovered the same biases while working for RSADSI, (at a time before
RC4 was revealed, or at least before RSADSI started discussing RC4
publically, a tacit admission by them that alleged RC4 was RC4)
Andrew Roos brutessl code was special case optimised for SSL, he
precomputed part of the MD5 digest, and progressed through the key
space in an order chosen to maximise the amount of MD5 precomputation
that could be done.  Something of interest, perhaps.
Strangly (I'm not sure if anyone lost money due to this), I think
Netscapes prices hardly suffered, perhaps even improved slightly.
Could be due to the `any publicity is good publicity' syndrome.  There
was a *lot* of publicity, and Netscapes response in fixing the problem
was good.  Several US cypherpunks were tracking the stocks at the
time, and could probably verify this.
One omission: you didn't say anything about Paul Kocher's timing
attack on RSA, which I think affected Netscape servers, and was fixed
after his publicizing the attack.  Then you could discuss Ron Rivest's
blinding solution, and the time delay solution.

@_subject: monkey-wrenching GAK 
This is along the lines of a technical monkey-wrenching of GAK:
1) The state of email encryption
If the NSA decides they would like to get a decrypt of an email that
you sent, they turn up with a copy of the encrypted email and request
that you decrypt it.
The reason that this is so bad is that you have effectively secret
shared your plaintext between the NSA (who has archived all of your
encrypted email), and yourself who still has they key.  This is not in
your interests.
2) Mandatory GAK
In a future with mandatory GAK, the NSA has all your keys already,
because they have a nice database of them, and so they can decrypt any
thing they feel like.
3) Monkey-wrenching Even with GAK, where you are forced to give the government the keys,
you can do much to make the job of administering GAK very expensive.
You start by ensuring that the government can not get your encrypted
data (the other half of the secret share), so that the key is of no
use :-)
You can do this by using a forward secret protocol such as
Diffie-Hellman to exchange data, then you can't provide the encrypted
text to the NSA even if you want to.
But won't they make forward secret protocols illegal at the same time
as enforcing GAK?  Well, maybe they've left it too late already,
  IP security layers in general - they provides an extra layer of
  encryption that the NSA has to obtain the keys for to make sense of
  their tap.  They may have to archive impossible amounts of IP traffic if
  they can't recognize the type of IP traffic through the IP level
  encryption (www traffic has its uses as cover traffic :-)
  IP security layers which use Diffie-Hellman: forward secrecy means
  that the site owners can't decrypt old IP traffic even if they want
  to.
  When using an IP security layer, email delivered via SMTP will be
  transparently sent over an encrypted link with a random symmetric
  encryption key negotiated with DH.  So the NSA can't get your
  encrypted email so the fact that they have the decryption key
  doesn't help them.
  Even if the NSA had access to the signatory keys used to
  authenticate DH key negotiation, this means that they still have to
  do an active MITM attack on the link.  This is not something they
  can do after the fact.  Bang goes the ability to archive it all and
  present it to people afterwards for decryption.  Also the expense
  and complexity of fishing expeditions become impractical.
  To do a successful MITM attack, the NSA must also subvert the
  authentication key infrastructure, and hope that no one uses a
  subliminal, or out-of-band channel to verify the authentication.
The above arguments, depending on how quickly things like John
Gilmore's S/WAN are deployed, will quickly reduce the Governments
options to:
  attempting to revoke de facto international standard internet
  protocols after the fact
  requesting the authentication keys used to sign DH negotiations, so
  that they can do MITM attacks, and get an IP packet modification
  infrastructure built (something significantly harder, and more
  expensive than the digital telephony bill which is still floundering
  at an estimated $4Bn)
So, to monkey wrench GAK, be an early adopter of IP link level
security, make sure that everybody is using link level security with
forward secrecy, long before Clipper IV gets forced into use as a
voluntary, or possibly later mandatory scheme.

think deeply about the implications of strong crypto, and document
this in a fairly comprehensive manner.  This is a central topic for
cypherpunks, after all: cypherpunks are trying to achieve poltical
ends via strong crypto, crypto isn't being discussed in isolation, as
a purely scientific endeavour.  sci.crypt with its charter is more
Also, I would point out that you yourself don't restrict yourself to
purely crypto discussions (aside from this latest war), you for
instance recently discussed driving licenses in NY.  Not that I am

credentials I consider on topic, but you are criticizing others for
analysing politics.  The [NEWS] series, also (I've already said I
consider these useful), are hardly pure discussion of crypto, if this
were your only concern.
True, and unfortunate.  coderpunks feels somewhat reminiscent of how
cypherpunks used to be in this regard, try subscribing to that, if you
are uninterested in political aspects, and have not already.  I
subscribe to both, because I think politics is also important, as well
as churning out code, and just read very selectively on cypherpunks.

I don't think it's near as serious as you are worrying about, all I

It appears that Chris Adams  started this.  And

The decision to keep the list open was made for reasons I agree with,

Censoring people is something cypherpunks are strongly against in

Yeah, great!  Only one more thing, use ellipses [...] to show large
volumes of stuff which isn't relevant to your current point, and your
quoting style is A1.  (eg most of the body of your quoted [NEWS] item
for the purposes of this discussion could have been ellipsed out).
Some friendly advice for you if you care to take it: if you care about
your reputation, I'd recommend dropping the Tim May is a liar, and the
crude insults, that should halt the recent drop in your reputation.
If you feel you have a legitimate complaint, you make your case better
by avoiding insults.  Also once things die down, or sooner (I'd prefer
sooner for the sake of my per second BT phone line charges :-), stop
forwarding any email to cypherpunks, and you're ready for some serious
crypto discussion.  The email forwarding is what seems to have caused
most complaints.
People do pay attention when positive contributions are made, for
instance I think I remember that you posted some time ago a way to
have two plausible decryptions for one cyphertext, to enable things
like duress keys, in terms of RSA.  The problem with this, however is
that RSA is currently very slow to use in its pure form for messages.

@_subject: crypto anarchy vs AP 
Been reading the AP thread, and thought I'd donate some of my views.
To me, crypto anarchy is a means to achieve a more libertarian
government, it is a pivotal tool to reduce government power, and
enable freedom and privacy.  A libertarian government means a less
powerful government, less taxes, less onerous laws, more freedoms.  I
don't think AP as stated by Jim could escalate quickly enough as a
mechanism to introduce a libertarian government, because if it got to
the state that too many politicians were openly threatened, and
killed, the government would declare a state of war, and switch off
the Internet.  You'd just cause the government to panic, and this
would have negative effects, it would take ages for them to calm down,
and the laws they'd pass in the mean time would mean a near certainty
of mandatory GAK as a condition to switching the Internet back on.
(Before someone takes me to task for the impossibility of switching
the Internet off, it all depends on the level of government panic.
More specifically perhaps they would disconnect key backbones, and
ISPs briefly while they rushed into effect a few presidential decrees
outlawing non GAKed crypto, anonymous ecash, remailers, PGP, DC-nets,
I think I understand what Jim is saying with AP, that it might be a
way to accelerate the arrival of libertarian government.  I'm not
saying I have any moral problems with a suitably restrained version of
AP, if it saved lives and resulted in a better life for many people.
(Some people might even view it as having a certain element of poetic
However I don't think it would survive the above hurdle.
(Also I have some thoughts on why AP might not achieve the desired
effects even if it could survive the hurdle which I will save for now,
in the interests of keeping this to a digestible length.)
Libertarian governments, if they come, I think will be more easily,
and more likely achieved via non-violent means.  I think it will be a
much more gradual process, and that government power will just be
gradually eroded as international businesses gain power, and borders
become more open, trade more free, as travel becomes cheaper, and
moving to another country becomes less of a hassle.  Telecommuting,
and remote education should help reduce the problems of moving
country.  If you telecommute, and your kids (if you have any) are
taught via the Net, and you can talk to your friends in photo
realistic real time VR chat rooms, it becomes much less important
where on the planet you live.
As information based work becomes more important, significant
proportions of government tax revenues may be siphoned off to
tele-workers from tax havens, and to those who just ignore local tax
laws in favor of anonymous ecash.  The ability to jurisdiction shop
for laws, and taxes in itself will reduce governments options.  It
will induce governments to try to provide incentives for international
businesses to use their jurisdictions, and to create the appearance of
as free a life style as they can for individuals.  The jurisdiction
shopping will start amongst the disenfranchised, and the adventurous,
but will spread as the advantages become clearer, and the hurdles are
reduced.  Tax collection will be restructured to tax tangibles, and
reduced to encourage customers (citizens).
Governments are currently flailing around trying to prolong the
inevitable.  The fall out from this is beginning to annoy some people.
If it annoys enough people soon enough that they vote in a Libertarian
candidate for president in the next 20 years, crypto anarchy, and
libertarian governments could be reached more quickly.  I'm not sure
it will ever get that far though, because the more votes the
libertarians get over the following years, the closer we get to
libertarian anyway, because the government has to start adopting their
policies to get the votes back.  (Much like the green movement, which
once it started getting significant votes, and media attention, was
pandered to by politicians of all parties.  They're all green now:-)
And so libertarian thinking starts to affect government thinking.
Crypto anarchy privacy preserving goodies such as anonymous ecash,
anonymous email, strongly free speech, right to encryption start to
fair better, and so start to undermine whats left of government.
Politicians, now posturing to try and look more libertarian might even
start to take on board the idea that there are simply too many
government employees, that may be the war on drugs causes more
problems than it solves, that sounding pro free speech is something
that might carry some votes, etc.
By the time governments get weak enough for AP to be feasible, they
will be so weak, and eager to entice you into their jurisdiction with
promised single digit tax rates, private dietary recommendation
services, friendly police forces, advertised local highlights: local
casinos, brothels, cuisine, favorable climate, reasonably priced
housing, etc, etc. that no one will care much about offing the fawning
officials (head salesmen, and brochure designer) anyway.
Well thats my theory :-)
It could all suffer a huge set-back if the government panics too soon,
and passes mandatory GAK by presidential decree or something.  One
hopes that whats left of the US first ammendment, and judicial system
would be enough to repeal such a move, but you never know.

extracting from part of another thread...
I'm not sure about quantum computers, some people who know much more
about particle physics than I do seemed initially sceptical, and
didn't think it was doable.  However I have read some optimistic
sounding news clippings (on the list) which sounded as if things are
progressing well, with techniques being found using redundancy to get
around what were earlier problems of reliability.  Is this accurate
reporting (thinking of garbled stories by over enthusiastic
journalists)?  I'd be interested to hear opinions from anyone who does
know about particle physics about the likihood of practical quantum
computers being practical in the next 20 years or so.
RSA has always had problems with two pitfalls in any proof of its
hardness: no proof that RSA is as hard as factoring, and no proof that
factoring is hard.  Rabin and variants of it at least have the proof
of being as hard as factoring.
You mentioned your opinion that a vastly better factoring algorithm
may yet be found.  What about the possibility of finding proof of a
useful lower bound for the complexity of factoring, do you have any
thoughts on the likelihood of this being achieved?  That would be a
very significant result, and in the absence of a quantum attack would
be as good as it gets. It would allow you to make realistic
calculations about physical limits of attacking it, in a similar manner
to the entropy calculations possible for brute force of symmetric
ciphers.  (Heat death of the sun before a solution even if every
particle was part of hardware key cracking computer type arguments).
One other area that did sound promising was some kind of mapping
problem in n dimensional tiling that Tim was discussing at a physical
meet while I was over in the US.  A news clipping posted to
cypherpunks a short time ago was talking about a researcher who had
constructed a crypto system related to the problem of finding paths in
a tiling problem (sounded like the same problem).  The interesting
part was that the researcher was reported as having a proof of
hardness.  Similarly is this being reported accurately?
Not familiar with the problem.  Is it something you could explain
briefly, or are there any on-line papers on the subject?

My point was therefore to suggest methods of trying to ensure that the
relevant people in german politics and the press could be made aware
of their loss.
I am wondering how someone in Germany could engineer the necessary
contacts.  By demonstrating to a journalist how it has not been
stopped.  Perhaps by writing to the politicians responsible for the
scare listing the number and jurisdictions of sites?  These are some
things that I think it might be fruitful for someone in Germany to
write to their polticians and journalists.
If one of the Germans who have posted to keep us up to date on this
topic could undertake to do this, I think they would be doing
something very useful for the cause of free speech.  For xs4all
management to write the same people a letter saying the same might
also be useful.
It needs some Germans to shout loudly on this.  Perhaps there are some
pressure groups who are pro-censorship who could be `fed' this
information, and encouraged to pressure the German politicians, to
also inadvertently help out the cause of free speech.
I'm trying to work up some _action_ here, any takers, German cpunks?

claiming that the gambling was legal.  (They'd get you for interstate

So, it seems to me that your only approach is to do the whole thing
anonymously.  That requires anonymous ecash (payee and payor
anonymous).  This means that the anonymous ecash bank will be shutdown
by the government as soon as it becomes apparent what is going on.
Remailer operators are similar soft targets.

A very good reason to post anonymously, agreed.  There is a cost with
anonymity: people take you less seriously, none of your reputation is
on the line.  Anonmous persistent personas might be better as they
allow reputation to be tracked.  However persistent personas open
themselves to writing style analysis attacks.
I'm not sure this follows.
If a corporate can use it's wealth to influence other groups, for
example by assasinating key employees of opposition company, it may
well get richer as a result.  People do things for their own benefit,
and to the extent that their predictions are accurate, those who
participate will fare better than those who do not (modulo the chance
of reprisals, if it is apparent who is doing the attacking, and if the
attacked organisation survives to retaliate).
Yeah, but if the premises required for AP to exist at all are true
(government-proof anonymous payment system), and if it doesn't turn
out to be much fun, you'll have a job getting out of it.

@_subject: Bypassing the Digicash Patents 
No offense Bob, but your pose takes some reading, too full of
metaphors, but I grok what you're saying, and the topic discussed here
I find interesting.
How about this, rather than interface your ecash system with US
dollars yourself through credit cards/ debit cards/ cheques / cash,
just set up an entirely disconnected system.
You may remember the digicash trial mint.  It was monopoly money,
theoretically it was worthless.  However people were selling freebees
for it (the odd T-shirt, cap etc), plus images, programs.  Also it was
collectable in the sense that there was a limited mint.
The unofficial digicash exchange was set up and some transactions took
place.  People were buying and selling the monopoly money for real
money, without digicash having to worry about the legality of the
interface to existing payment systems.  The black market/ unoffcial
market took care of it.  Also the internet casino is interesting in
relation to this.  They accept many payment forms, if they started
accepting our "net cash" (net in the sense that it only means anything
directly in terms of the net), then you could exchange cash by playing
some low rake off game such as roulette.  (Just keep betting on black,
the commision is the house slot, and you take your chips away in real
world currency).
The cryptographic requirements for a system such as this would be:
 1) anonymous (privacy preserving, payee and payer anonymous
 2) distributed (to make it hard to shut down)
 3) have some built in scarcity
 4) require no trust of any one individual
 5) preferably offline (difficult to do with pure software)
 6) reusable
My ideas so far are hashcash (where the scarcity is related to your
processing power).  (See However this makes for hyper-inflation because of the rapid increase
in CPU power.  hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed,
each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them.
You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash)
and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions
addressed to it.
However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited
amounts of money for it's own use.
So, perhaps you could have multiple banks and let reputation sort them
out, if you could arrange the protocols so that it would be apparent
if a bank was minting more cash than it had received hash collisions
for.  (Say by publishing the collisions, and making it possible to
publically verify the quantity of cash in circulation).
But if you've got multiple banks then you've got to have an exchange
mechanism.  The market could probably take care of this, setting
exchange rates based on banks reputations.
However it would be nicer to have something which required no trust
and which had no posssibility of cheating rather than relying on
reputation to sort them out.
The problem with anonymous ecash to continue your metaphor is that
.WK1 files also happen to be illegal or surrounded by huge amounts of
banking regulations.  So even though the new system is better the
negative forces acting against so far have succeeded in stifling it.
One of the negative forces also is user stagnation, people are used to
cheques and credit cards, even if they are inefficient and prone to

What is an Eternity Service?
(Some of you may recognize the name `Eternity Service' from Ross
Anderson's paper of that name.  What I have implemented is a related
type of service which shares Anderson's design goals, but has a
simpler design.  Rather than invent a new name, I just borrowed
Anderson's, unless anyone can think of a better name. Anderson has the
paper available on his web pages (look for `eternity') at
 Also I heard that Eric Hughes
gave a talk on UPS `Universal Piracy Service' I presume this has
similar design goals, though I have not heard further details.)
I have implemented this to give something concrete to think about in
terms of creating something closer to Andersons real eternity service
in robustness.
The eternity server code above provides an interface to a distributed
document store which allows you to publish web pages in such a way
that the attacker (the attacker here is a censor such as perhaps a
government, perhaps your government) can not force you to unpublish
the document.
It's architecture is quite simple.  We already have an extremely
robust distributed document store: USENET news.  We already have the
ability to post messages to the document store anonymously: type I and
type II (mixmaster) remailers.  So theoretically we can publish what
ever we want, just post it to USENET.  However retreiving the data is
cumbersome.  We must search USENET with a search engine, or look
manually for the document, the document will expire after some short
time.  You may still be able to find the document in a search engine
which archives news for longer periods such as dejanews or altavista.
However, it is not as user friendly as a web based interface, there
are no hypertext links between related documents, there are no inline
graphics, etc.
So my `eternity server' is a kind of specialised web search engine
which acts as a kind of web proxy and provides a persistent web based
interface to reading web pages stored in encrypted documents posted to
different USENET groups.  The web search engine provides persitent
virtual URLs for documents even if they move around with different in
different news groups, being posted via different exit remailers.
Signatures on documents allows the user to update document.  The web
proxy has options to cache documents, and otherwise fetches from
a USENET newsspool or nntp news server.
Technical Description
The system offers different levels of security to users.  All
documents must be encrypted.  The subject field of the document should
include the SHA1 hash of the document's virtual URL.  (All eternity
virtual urls are of the form:
that is they would not function as normal urls because the use the
non-existant TLD "eternity".  You may be able to use this facility to
get your browser to look at a particular eternity server to serve
documents of this form).
The lowest level of security is to encrypt the document with PGP -c
(IDEA encryption) with the passphrase "eternity".  This is just
obfuscation to make the documents marginally harder to examine in
USENET without using the eternity service to automate the process.
The next level of security is encrypt the document with the SHA1 of a
1 prepended with the URL.  ie This means that you can not read documents unless you know the URL.
Of course, if you can guess the URL then you can read them.
The third level of security is to additionally to one of the above two
options to encrypt the document with another passphrase of your
chosing.  Then you can give the passphrase only to those amongst your
circle of friends.
Additionally support is given for signed documents.  This is important
because once you've published a web page you might wish to update it.
And yet you don't want other people updating it with a blank page (or
otherwise changing your page) as this would be as good as the ability
to remove the page.
If you include a PGP public key with a document, the eternity server
will associate that PGP key with the hash of your documents URL.  Any
attempts to update that document will only succeed if signed by the
same PGP key.
The document server has the option to cache documents.  Cacheing can
either be turned off (in which case documents are always fetched from
the news spool, this is not that inefficient as the news spool may be
local, and the server keeps a database of USENET group/article number
against document hash, and so can directly fetch the document), or
cacheing can be turned on, or cacheing can be set to encrypted, in
which case documents in the cache are encrypted with a passphrase
derived from the SHA1 of the document's URL by prepending a 1 to the
URL.  In the encrypted mode if the server operator is not keeping
logs, he can't decrypt the documents in his own cache.  If cacheing is
off there are no documents in the cache, only in the USENET news
In addition some users will have a password which is pasted into an
extra password field on the field
Users can set their own per document cacheing options (they can set no
cacheing to override the options of on or encrypted on the server), or
they can set encrytped to override cachine turned on, etc.
There is a document index at eternity root ( " ), and
users may optionally request documents to be included in the directory
of eternity documents and virtual hosts.  It makes sense to include
the root document of your set of web pages in the index, and to leave
the rest out of the index.  Then you can link to your own pages from
your original page.
Relative URLs work, inline graphics work, site relative URLs work, and
it includes crude support for mime types, so most normal web data
types will work as normal.
The document format is:
[pgp key]
[eternity document]
The flags are can be any of:
URL: Options: directory or exdirectory
Cache: on/yes/off/no/encrypt/encrypted
Description: An example eternity document
The pgp key is an asii armored PGP key, and the eternity document must
also be ascii armored and may optionally be signed (with the
acompanying pgp key).  The eternity document can also be encrypted
again inside that layer with a user key which need never be revealed
to the server.
The overall document is encrypted with PGP -c password "eternity", or
with a password obtained by prepending a 1 to the URL as obtained like
% echo -c 1" | sha1
The flags, pgp key and eternity document can be arbitrarily jumbled
up in order.
The eternity server source code includes an examples directory.
The eternity server has a configuration file which is heavily
commented: eternity.conf.
Threat Models
Think of this as a specialised search engine. If you don't like the
documents you find, then change your search terms, don't complain to
one of the many search engine maintainers! The Eternity Service is
designed to facilitate publishing in a web based form of non
government approved reading or viewing material, or the publishing of
non government approved software, or other "liberated" documents,
programs, etc.  Each user can easily install their own search engine
in a shell account for their own use.
Newsgroups are very robust against attack because they are part of a
distributed system: USENET news. It is difficult to remove a USENET
newsgroup (the Scientologists know, they tried and failed, and they
have seriously deep pockets, and attitude to match). For the eternity
service it probably doesn't matter that much if you do get rid of a
particular newsgroup, eternity documents can be in any
newsgroup. Somehow I don't think you'll succeed in getting rid of all
USENET newsgroups, ie in shutting USENET news down. I'm not sure that
a major government could succeed in that even.
Information wants to be free. Long live USENET news.
Improving robustness
The main problem with this system that I see is that documents don't
live long in USENET news spools as expiry dates are often 1 week or
less.  So to use the service you'd have to set up a cron job to repost
your web documents every week or so.  Some documents remain in the
cache and so survive as long as there is interest in them.
An immediately easy thing to do is to include support for fetching and
looking documents up in altavista's news archive and in dejanews
archive.  This shouldn't be that difficult.  The eternity server
article database already includes newsgroup and message id against
document hash, all that is required is to formulate the requests
correctly.  If anyone wants to add this, feel free.
A mechanism for eternity servers to query each other's caches would be
one mechanism to think about.
Another would be to charge anonymous digicash rates to keep documents
in the cache a couple of $ per Mb/year.
Also you could perhaps think about charging for acccesses to the
service and passing a royalty back to the document author.
There is no `ownership' of eternity virtual domains, or of document
paths.  If Alice puts a document at  there is
nothing to stop Bob putting other files under that virtual domain,
such as   However in general Bob can't
make Alice's document point to his URLs.  Bob can't modify or remove
Alice's pointer from the eternity directry   But he
can add his own entry.
There can however be race conditions.  If Alice puts up a document on
 which points to an inline gif, but hasn't yet
put up that inline gif, Bob can get there first and put up a picture
of Barney until Alice notices and changes here pointer to point to the
picture she wants to point at.
So one solution would be to only accept documents which are signed by
the signator of the next domain up.  First come first served for the
virtual domains, the key signing the root dir of the virtual domain is
checked for each file or directory added under that.
Note even if the URLs are exdirectory, this need not be a problem as
you can just try the path with one directory stripped off.  Could be
done.  Is it worth it though?  It would add overhead to the server,
and there is minimal distruption someone can cause by sharing domains.
Perhaps it is desirable for someone to own a domain by virtue of being
the first person to submit a document with the hash of that domain
together with a key.
The rest of this document is things on the to do list, if you feel
like helping out, or discover a limitation or bug.
To do list
It could do with some documentation.  And some stress testing.  The
file locking hasn't really been tested much.  NNTP may be flaky
as I made some mods since last debugging.
It would be nice to have a CGI based form to submitting documents.
Paste signed ascii armored document here.  Paste public key here.
Click radio buttons to choose options.  Enter URL here.  Type in
newsgroup to send to. Click here to submit through a chain of
mixmaster remailers.
There are a few bugs in the above system which ought to be fixed, but
this is alpha code, and they are on the TODO list.  One problem is
that the flags aren't signed.  A change of message format will fix
that in a later version.  The basic problem is that you can't check
the signature until you've decrypted and obtained the key.  At which
point you have to decrypt again.  A simple fix would perhaps to be to
put the public key outside the outer encryption envelope, but that is
unattractive in terms of allowing author correlation even by people
who don't have passphrases or don't know URLs.  Better would be to
just decrypt once, obtain the key if there is one, and then check the
sig again.  The server already keeps a database of PGP keys (not using
PGP's keyring) it stores keys by the SHA1 hash of the armored public
key and indexes against document URL hashes.  In this way public keys
do not need to be included in later document updates.  This could be
used to check a signature on the outer encryption layer.  Then only
the first post needs to decrypt twice (once without key available to
check sig, and then again with key available).  As a nice side effect
this protects against the PGP 0xdeadbeef attack (or 0xc001d00d as Gary
Howland has on his public key).
Another problem is when scanning a newsgroup, if the scanned message
can not be read it just stores it for later, so that when someone
accesses the server who knows the URL for that document it can be
decrypted and scanned for good signature and updated then.  However
the code only has a place holder for one document at the moment.  That
should be changed to a list and appropriate code to scan the list when
the document is accessed.  Once the newest document is found, the list
of documents to be scanned can be discarded and the newest article
stored against the hash in article.db.
Another more subtle problem is that the code may update documents in
the wrong order if multiple versions are posted to different news
groups.  The articles are scanned one group at a time.  So if the
groups are scanned in order alt.anonymous.messages followed by
alt.cypherpunks, and version 2 of the document is in alt.anon.msgs,
and version 1 in alt.cp, then it will update the document with the
older version.
Another to do list entry is the cache replacement policy.  There isn't
one, your cache will grow indefinately as documents are never removed.
Another thing to do is the altavista and dejanews lookup via HTTP by
message-id.  All the place holders are there.
If anyone wants to tackle any of the above tasks feel free.
The program dbmdump prints out .db files in ascii so you can see what
is there.
eternity -u is suitable to run as a cron job, or just at the console.
eternity -r resets everything, clears out the cache, empties database
is the form to use as a cgi.  It handles both GET and POST methods.
There is a log file for debugging, see eternity (the perl program) for
how to set different logging opitons. You can log most aspects of the
program for debugging purposes.

My announce was rather hurried, and someone suggested to me the use of
a proxy as an architecture for interfacing to the eternity service
rather than the cgi based system I have.
The person who suggested this to me also described some work on a
"universal proxy framework" which is designed to enable things like
"cookie-cutting, onion routing etc."  Also it was suggested this is a
cheaper way to implement a proxy.
Here are some comments on possible architectures for an eternity
There are a number of places where one might put a eternity server:
  - cgi script on your ISP for yourself and others to use
  - cgi script and local web server on your dial up linux box
  - standalone eternity proxy running on an ISP
  - local proxy
  - proxy framework module (local or remote? does it support both)
  - apache module "eternity proxy module"
  - browser plugin (if this has the power to do it)
My ideal interface would have been a web proxy, as this allows the
user to transparently integrate this into their browser.  You may be
able to set your browser to use the proxy to handle *.eternity, and
have the rest go direct, but I'm not so sure on this point.
Regardless, the proxy can forward requests as cacheing proxies do for
documents not in *.eternity.
My first consideration was to get a proof of concept going as quickly
as possible.  What you are looking at is a weekend hack + 3 days
debugging and cleaning up.
Proxies have higher user requirements to set up, you need root, or at
least ability to leave processes running indefinately, and some
mechanism to restart them on reboot (or do it manually).
My cgi-bin implementation allows you to run with cgi access, and cron,
or at a pinch to do without cron even.
Local proxies have higher development costs, in that it involves
windows code to be of use for the majority of users, which has much
higher development cost.  The universal proxy framework (which I am
not familiar with) would allow a local proxy to be implemented more
easily if I understand correctly.
Local handling of at least the last layer of decryption would help
from a security point of view.  Or the local proxy could be a full
eternity server for your own use.
The ones I've made possible with my cgi based implementation are the
first two, I chose them over proxies simply because they are the
easiest to implement first.
Basically what I have implemented is a poor mans remote proxy or (with
a local webserver) a poor unix person's local proxy.  You give it URLs
of the form:
  The cgi script modifies on the fly URLs in documents (if they are type
text/html) and involve *.eternity to have prefix:
  cgi-bin/eternity?url=
Well actually it copes with local, and site relative urls also (where
site is the eternity virtual site).  Normal URLs are left as is.
Proxy is the more elegant way to do it as you don't have to re-write
urls on the fly.
There are advantages to running the server (proxy or otherwise) on an
ISP rather than locally:
- if you're using the cgi solution and an SSL web server you get SSL
  encryption on the link.  This way people don't get to see your
  requests, if they are handled locally by your ISP from it's news
  spool.
- it has lower bandwidth requirements which may be an advantage, as
  you don't have to down load all the eternity documents, only the ones
  you want to read as you browse them
- if the eternity server is running on your ISP and the ISP has a
  local newspool people outside the ISP can not see your requests go
  to the NNTP server to see which articles you are reading.
There are some advantages to local proxies:
- you don't rely on the ISP or the eternity service operator not to
  log exdirectory URLs, and not to log your accesses.  (However note
  that your ISP can observe your use of the NNTP server, unless you
  protect against this by saving all eternity web pages locally, so
  that you never have to do a NNTP lookup per article).
- if you are accessing URLs which are private (encrypted with a
  password inside the final layer) you don't need to give this
  password to the server to get it to decrypt for you.  (You don't
  need to with the remote proxy, but you get back a PGP message which
  you then have to manually decrypt, unless you can figure out a
  browser plugin to automatically decrypt PGP documents on the fly as
  they are read).
A local proxy used in combination with remote proxy or cgi-proxy would
allow another architecture.  Your local proxy obtains it's article
hash -> message-id/newsgroup/article-number database from a real
remote eternity proxy which is watching news as it comes in.
Then it can fetch the articles itself with lower overhead.
Another architecture (moving more towards Anderson's meaning of an
eternity service) is the idea of forwarding requests between eternity
servers.  In this way the eternity servers would be "remailing" your
requests.  If your entry point into the eternity service network was
via an SSL protected link, and the links between the eternity servers
were encrypted, the eternity servers as a whole would disguise who was
accessing what.  You could allow proxying of normal web pages too, and
create a distributed version of anonymizer.com as a side effect.

You first of all extract your a PGP key with pgpacket.  (You'll need
to change the password to be no password (press enter when prompted
for password), so that PGP doesn't encrypt the private key.

Here's a small example (Fred is a notional eternity user who's key,
both public and private is included in the eternity distribution):
Fred's public key:

Fred's secret key (no password):
-----BEGIN PGP SECRET KEY BLOCK-----

-----END PGP SECRET KEY BLOCK-----

% pgp -kxa fred fredpub ~/.pgp/pubring.pgp and to get private key do:
% pgp -kxa fred fredpri ~/.pgp/secring.pgp Next get pgpacket.pl, see ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/pgp/utils/ or
something like that.
Then run pgpacket on the fredpri.asc (it contains all the info that
you want, without looking at fredpub.asc, ie the values for e, d and
% pgpacket fredpri.asc
The values for e, d, and n are:
e = 11

Now you can encrypt for fred like so:

and to decrypt:

a modular exponentiation operator, so you can do: "m e n |" and it'll
do it directly.  This feature was a special, just for perl rsa because
Ken Pizzini, author of GNU dc, happens to be one of the major

@_subject: free market services vs monopoly government 
Isn't that a bit humpty dumpty words mean what I say they mean-ish?
Clearly my use of the word government above is intended to mean your
or my government.  If I was in the US I might have used the term USG,
but as I'm not I generalised to governments, meaning existing
governments of countries.  Government has other dictionary meanings.
I'll admit there are situations where a government may make a good
decision, or handle a situation not too badly, or not that
restrictively.  Such situations are quite rare though, aren't they :-)
All words are neutral as abstract terms, it's only when you consider
the semantics of your intended meaning in using them in given contexts
that they become other than abstract.
Nuclear bomb is an neutral term.
Didn't say otherwise.  I gave the example of the ex Soviet Union as a
worse, more restrictive government than either US or UK government in
the post you are replying to.
As a general rule: less government intervention is more efficient than
more.  This is because the free market is better at meeting people's
demands in a tailored fashion than any socialist/communist planned
economy handed down by a few big-wigs.
Are you against privatisation?  Are you against deregulation?
I suppose you'd like to unreform the US telco's and put it back into
one huge monopoly charging monopoly rates?  Clearly US telco's have a
long way to go in terms of having a free competitive arena with FCC
intervention, but surely you aren't denying the improved efficiency
the deregulation you have had has produced.
It's not black or white.  (Where did I read that sentence, hmmm).
In the UK we have a socialist state.  Government provides a huge
social security system.  They have cut back on it a bit in the last 20
years, but it's still a disgrace the way money is wasted.
Nationalised medical care, all out of your tax bill.  No wonder the
tax rate is > 50% effective.  Some scandinavian countries are up in
the 60 and 70% effective tax range.
Would you like some of that in the US?  At least you currently have
mostly privatised medical care.
My point is really that the more market freedom, more deregulation,
less government intervention, less attempts to influence the market
the better off we'll all be.
Do you think it would be a good thing if the government started taxing
Internet usage?
Jeez, just imagine how much better off you could be without all the
government crapola.
Maybe a bit of self-interest :-) Eg if the cancerous growth stifles
too much trade, it might get less tax revenues.  I view Clinton's
recent "hands off" approach to the internet in this light, if he
actually means anything concrete by it.
Governments too.  ie what I said was true for governments so why
contest the fact?  So there are other systems it is true for, so what?
I didn't say there weren't.
OK, lets start with deregulation, and privatisation of everything that
it is immediately possible to arrange.  Not so radical is it?
You aren't going to get a purely market based economy with no
government intervention over night, clearly.
Sounds remarkably similar to the current situation doesn't it?
Anyway you just buy into Mr Lee's New Hong Kong protection racket, and
Uncle Enzo will respect Mr Lee's fire-power enough to consider it not
worth the effort of picking on small fry like you.
It's not black and white.  It's not all or nothing.  We can start with
less government, before it shrivels up to close to zero.
Cultural and societal change have happened in the past.  I guess
you've read of the feudal systems.  Well society's structure has
changed.  If you lived in feudal systems, you'd be one of the serfs
happy with his lot tithing to the lord of the manor, and to the fat
church, and being left with barely enough to eat.
Clearly presures exist today where people would like to move to
different regimes.  People are real keen to get out of less free
governments into freer ones.  I won't bother with examples, anyone can
come up with those.
See anything wrong with making a currently relatively free government
into an even less restrictive government?
Tell me, are the following insane ideas:
That suggests to me that he is slightly cracked, as well as being a
inventive physicist.
Yup, cracked.
Work towards the principle that free markets are more efficient than
state monopolies.
Adam Smith is a pretty sound pure market economics text.  If you can
refute any of it's claims, which are in the main logical, or
mathematical readily observable truisms, I'd be interested to hear
your arguments.
Hayek just points out the clearly observable trends with Socialism.
If you can't see much of what he was saying back in 1944 replayed
before your eyes in the US, you've got your eyes closed.
Rand is a somewhere between the two, lots of negative things to say
about socialism, and also lots to say about free market.

@_subject: bulk postage fine (was Re: non-censorous spam control) 
OK, lets say we make emails free, unmetered, but they _must_ include a
valid token for 0c.  (OK Dimitri?)
Next we choose a threshold say 1000 posts per day.  Seems hard to
imagine anyone generating manually over 1000 emails per day.  That's
more than 1 per minute for a 10 hour day.
Next when you sign up for this new email postage system, you have to
hand over a $100 deposit.  The 0c payments are anonymous.  But if you
spend over 1000 of them in one day, your identity becomes known (via a
mechanism like that used for Chaum's off-line double spending
detection protocol).  You loose $100.  To you, the spammer, the posts
cost 10c each.  Your account is disabled until you pay another $100.
However there are a number of practical problems with the above scheme:
- How do we stop spammers buying unwanted 0c postage stamps from
people for under 10c a stamp?
- Sounds like an online protocol, will be high bandwidth requirements
at the bank(s)
- How do we stop banks cheating and spamming or selling spammers
postage more cheaply
Doesn't look like it could work, unless anyone has any ideas to fix-up
a distributed protocol which can acheive something like this, and
preserve anonymity at the same time.

The email could be delivered a number of ways, remailer, users ISP,
some other ISP's open access sendmail hub (a lot of systems you can
connect to on the SMTP port and use them as a forwarder.  Some people
use this to do crude forgeries.  Spammers like this kind of trick).
It is the recipient who is enforcing the rules indirectly because, the
recipient cashes the 0c tokens on receipt.  That way the bank gets
back all the spent tokens.
There is a neat protocol that Chaum uses in his off-line ecash
protocol which allows you to have ecash which is anonymous so long as
you don't spend it twice.  If you spend twice the bank finds out your
identity, and then penalizes you.
This protocol could be extended to have ecash which revealed your
identity if you spent more than 1000 of a given minting.  The bank
would issue a fresh mint of ecoins each day.
Because you can bypass your ISP once you've got PPP or SLIP running.
You can telnet to port 25 (smtp port) on any of millions of open SMTP
ports.  You could send via a remailer.
It is up to the recipient if he wants to join up with this anti-spam
system.  If he does all email that arrives in his email box without a
0c postage token gets bounced back to the recipient.  (You can have
some fall back so that people without signing up can still get through
to you, don't just do a blind bounce, but bounce with a nonce (random
number), so that they have to reply with that random number in the
mail, and then you'll get it.)
I'm not sure the whole thing is that practical though because of the
sheer number of TCP/IP connections required to do an online banking
protocol for each and every mail.  The bank server would melt down.
So perhaps you could have lots of banks.  The other thing that is
wrong with it is that you have to trust the banks.

@_subject: no government regulation of the net (was Re: bulk postage fine) 
It happens, but IMO it's an inefficient dumb way to go about business.
The more modern net based enterprises will use more efficient
non-governmental solutions, and their more efficient conflict
resolution mechanisms will allow them to out-price, and eventually
cause the dinosaurs to go bankrupt, or to adopt similarly efficient
Government backed legal systems are inefficient.  A purely anonymous
transaction where both parties identity is well concealed is much more
efficient.  There is no one to sue.  Fighting legal suits is
expensive, especially in the US.
The high rates go to the unproductive members of society, government
court officials, over-priced lawyers, etc.  This drives up all prices
through insurance premiums.  The company has to pass on the cost of
the legal system to their clients.
Mutually negotiated arbitration as part of the contract of sale is
much more efficient.  Third party arbitrators holding with a copy of
the contract, a deposit from each party in escrow, and a reputation as
a fair arbitrator is much more efficient.  Either party breaks the
contract as decided by the arbitrator and they loose their deposit.
Some people are using arbitration services now as an alternative to
the government legal system.  This is a form of automatic
privatisation of the legal system.  The government legal systems are
facing free market competition.
It'll probably help if the arbitration service is anonymous also, else
some idiot will fall back to the government backed legal system and
raise the prices of arbitration through the insurance costs they'll
have to factor in case of being themselves sued in a government court.
True.  But how do you prove to one of these inefficent government
courts that it is indeed the spam beneficiary who posted the spam.
What if he says "I didn't do it"?  He's probably right, he probably
paid Spamford to do it for him.  Or perhaps someone doesn't like the
company and does a spam with their contact information just to cause
them trouble?  I'm sure it's happened before.
I'm not sure it's so easy to identify the spammer.  You can't sue the
person who's number is at the bottom.  What about the politician who's
home phone number got spammed to alt.sex.* as a phone sex number.
So to the government mentality when they bump into this problem, it
means that they will try to prevent anonymity.  They'll want you to
use their new fangled PKI to have either no anonymity, or else
escrowed anonymity, where the government gets to see who everyone is.
That's also not a good thing.
The danger with using government to attack spammers, is that this is
the net, and we don't want governments involved in regulation of
content, nor in attempting to enforce "identity escrow", "internet
drivers licenses" or anything else.
This is the likely long term or even possibly short term outcome of
calling for help from government to sort out spammers.
We can sort them out ourselves without the need of government
intervention, thanks kindly.

Socialism tends to lead to a fascist society.
That's a reasonable expose' of the similarities.
The free market is much closer to the freedom of the net than you
might imagine.
eg. Socialism says that the state will steal from by force (guns,
imprisonment, etc follow quickly if you resist the theft) to give to
others who `need'.  Needs are unbounded.  How do you measure `need'?
By who has the most expensive lobyists, who can afford to pay the
highest bribes to politicians?  By who is the laziest and has allowed
their personal affairs to slip into the most disgraceful state.
In a free market economy such `needs' are met by charity.  People give
of their own free will, and give to charitable organisations that they
view as the most efficient at handling the causes they individually
think worthy.
If people don't want to give to this charitable cause, well then it
isn't worth supporting, to them.  If you have to take their charity
and gun point, it isn't charity, it's theft.
Socialism is based on theft.  So is Fascism.  It's forced labour, or
at least forced theft of assetts.

The way such pay for email systems as I see them would interface with
your existing email system is that you would have a list of addresses
which you would be happy to receive email from for free.
Clearly a the list address for a list you subscribed to is an address
you would put in your "receive email without postage" list.
Mail from email addresses not on this list would be expected to
include a valid 0c postage stamp.  If they don't include the postage
the mail gets bounced together with a nag about installing the system,
and possibly a manual way for them to send you the email in spite of
the system
(Note most spammers use non-replyable email addresses, because they
don't want you to know their ISPs address, because their ISP will yank
their account as soon as they figure out what they're up to.)

@_subject: distributed data store, a la eternity 
The eternity servers announced recently are experimental.  That is to
say they are designed as a vehicle for improvement.  They are not
completed systems yet.  I am most keen myself to see eternity servers
which are truly resilient; the implementation we have is a first cut.
The whole idea is for it to be improved.
As to the risks issue (being an eternity server operator might lead to
legal hassles, and therefore people need to make money to compensate),
I have three main comments on that:
1. Accepting money for activities might worsen your legal position as
   you are then personally offering services.  This issue has been
   argued about in the past in relation to the idea of having
   for-pay remailers.  I'm not legally qualified to comment on this.
2. With my design the document store is a separate distributed system
   which is now part of the landscape, and is well accepted as a home
   for all kinds of dodgy materials and discussions.  People are used
   to the fact that some alt USENET newsgroups are full of material
   which is illegal in some parts of the world.  If you start from
   scratch with a new document distribution method, your first few
   servers are easy targets, due to small numbers.  People will be
   intolerant of them, and the Feds will probably go for RICO
   conspiracy and lock all 6 up.  Game over before you start.  I agree
   that you can do much better theoretically with this model, but
   you've got to consider existing network social norms, USENET is
   part of the landscape.  You won't simultaneously manage to threaten
   all news admins in the world to close down alt groups, they are in
   too many countries, and admins will rebel, and there will be plenty left.    So using USENET allows you to point the finger and say "it's not my
   material, it's just USENET posts".  Much like altavista doesn't
   issue cancel messages for posts in USENET news, it's not their
   problem, they're just providing a view onto a distributed database.
   Or much like providing an open access NNTP server, or access to
   users only as done by thousands of ISPs the world over without
   ill-effect modulo localised attempts to force people to not carry
   some groups.
   Another less openly stated opinion of mine is that the way to do it
   is to start as I have, and add other document sharing channels
   later.  Keep some confusion for the observer as to where the
   material is coming from.  As long as it _might_ have come out of
   USENET news on the fly, you can use that as a cover argument.  If
   the shit hits the fan you can fall back to that.
   Probably long term I think you would want to keep USENET as    a fall back system, but definately keep it as the distribution
   channel (it is _the_ most secure way of delivering anonymous
   messages, where you want to protect the recipients identity:
   broadcast it).  Much better than sending mail via anonymous
   remailers.  Mixmaster is good, but not that good in the face of
   repeated posting by one individual of materials which seriously
   annoy a major government.
3. Last argument is the "good enough" argument.  If the above tactic
   of using USENET as a distribution mechanism, and having cacheing,
   and optionally charging for storage, with exchange of articles
   between servers survives censorship in practice, why bother with
   anything more complex.
   For example Ross talks about arranging it so that documents are
   reconstructed from secret shares so that individual servers don't
   know what they've served.  Well that's sexy stuff, and clearly more
   secure if you absolutely must conceal which server served what
   material, if it has definately got the material from a database
   which it owns.
   The basic threat model of my eternity server design is
   disposable nodes.  That is it's like the new low orbit satellite
   systems, the satellites fall in and burn up after a while, but it
   doesn't matter because it's part of the design to keep throwing up
   new ones often enough to ensure continuous cover.  Same for
   eternity servers.  Individuals will cave, but when they do other
   enraged netters will start some more in protest.
   Just look at the Scientologist battles.  It's simply amazing the
   bravery of the Scientologist detractors in face of types of
   harrasement thrown at them.  Despite this the Scientologists are
   losing in that their materials are all over the place.  This
   suggests to me that USENET could work just fine.
   Also there is the possibility of private eternity servers.  That is
   you have an eternity server for your own use only, or only for a
   group of friends, or only for users of your ISP.  That one won't
   come under attack, and provided USENET doesn't get censored you'll
   be ok.
   Perhaps pointing the finger at USENET will be an effective
   strategy.  Perhaps we'll find out one way or another in the next
   few months :-)  Empirical cryptography.
Now some ideas on moving towards a real Anderson Eternity Service (in
small stages, the first steps are far removed), I have several ideas
for where to go next:
a) Cache replacement policy based on number of accesses
   There is currently a cache of eternity documents.  Documents and
   servers are configurable to either cache: on, off, or encrypted.
   One solution to the question of what happens when you fill up that
   100Mb cache is to discard least accessed pages.  Popular stuff stays,
   and you have fixed storage requirements.  The mantra "Disk is cheap".
   It wouldn't kill someone these days to dedicate a 6Gb disk for an
   eternity cache.
b) Have the above cache policy augmented with pay for disk space with
   ecash storage fee included with post.  Realistically for either you
   need a way for eternity servers to ask each other for articles.
   Well they can do that easily enough via http, but you still need
   to know which servers are available.
c) Use news archival services as another database to query.  eg
   altavista, dejanews.  I am starting to think that this is not such
   a hot idea now, because it's too centralised, and the operators are
   already hostile to bloat of their archive space, and do things like
   truncate UUencoded documents, and PGP ascii armored documents already.
   I mean ok, I'm sure we could run a war of new crude stego improvements
   being countered by more advanced eternity article detectors, up until
   we get to a natural langauge looking stego encoder.  Texto is a simple
   example of one of these.
Payment is definately going to go in.  It will be necessary to control
volume somehow if it gets popular, and it allows providors to cover
their expenses.  Charging for document download might be an idea also
to cover bandwidth.
That has to come also, because of USENET expiring, and because of the
non-distributed nature of systems of using the news archival services
(dejanews etc).
Initial ideas are:
- have list of eternity servers, and query them randomly until you
find one which has the document.  Pro: simple solution, fast lookup,
Con: has easily accessible comprehensive list of who's running
eternity servers.
- build something in terms of remailers to allow eternity servers to
query each other anonymously.  Con: _slow_ lookup.
- build specialised DC-net or pipe net setup with eternity servers on
it.  Pro: fast lookup, harder to track who's serving what, Con: no
implementations yet, con  provides a fat target for distrupting,
take out the DC net/pipenet and the document exchange connectivity
- secret sharing documents over eternity servers
One approach would be to treat anonymity as a separable issue from the
issue of hiding which server served which document (and issues of
secret sharing etc).
That is couldn't the viewer use crowds, or less securely
However I think there is an opportunity to have the document
constructed by the eternity server nodes in such a way that only the
requester can reconstruct the document.  Eg each server encrypt the
share it is serving with the requesters public key.  Then only the
requester can recover the shares and hence the document.  You should
make sure it's forward secrect too.
I'm all for payment methods.  Perhaps hascash
( would be a good experimental
currency to get it working with first, and then switch to real
anonymous ecash a bit later.
I'm all for making things as resilient and crypgraphically strong as
you can.  However I think part of the reason for different opinions is
that you are addressing three issues at once:
  - non censorable document store
  - preventing people correlating material with the server which served it
  - making the users accesses anonymous
The design of my eternity server as it is at the moment trying to
address just:
  - non censorable document store
by relying on the low orbit satellite model for public access servers,
and the borrowing from the dififculty of censoring USENET news.
Mild attempts can be made to protect correlation of users with
material accessed:
  - enable ssl on the server
(Cheap solution I know, as it relies on the trustworthiness of the
operators of the server, and that the system hasn't been compromised
by hackers, and that you have possibility of MITM attack if the
servers certificate isn't authenticated, or even if it is with a more
determined long term MITM attack).
No attempt is made to prevent:
  - people correlating material with the server which served it
because that is outside the design criteria.  Who cares what they
correlate for the server.  The server is just forwarding you USENET
news articles, just like an open access NNTP server, with a bit of
If someone takes enough exception to that there will be plenty of
other eternity servers to take up the slack.

@_subject: Eternity Uncensorable? 
These comments are useful, as eternity needs some documentation, and
I'm supposed to be writing an article for Phrack on this for deadline
of this sunday, and arguing with people is a good way to get
motivation to write explanations etc.  This dual purpose is why this
is a longish post.
Two comments on this:
- I understand cancels are ignored a lot of places, due to problems with
  censorous people, and pranksters issuing tons of forged cancels.
  These censorous people are actually doing us a big favour because it
  is their actions which has led to the widespread policy of ignoring
  cancels.
  However this is going on other peoples information.  I don't have
  any figures for how widespread the practice of configuring news to
  ignore cancels is.    Perhaps we could do a little experiment here, you (or someone who
  has the tools/knowhow handy try cancelling the dozen or so eternity
  articles in alt.anonymous.messages, and we'll have a little survey
  amongst list readers as to how well the cancels work.
- Comment   The eternity servers have caches.  They cache
  documents. (This is configurable).  There is currently no cache
  replacement policy because I haven't got around to it yet.  So
  currently once viewed the docs stay there forever.  (When I do get
  around to cache a replacement policy it will be either least
  accessed, and/or lowest ecash payment).
I'm however not so keen to promote the idea that actually the docs you
are looking at are coming off the servers cache because it's nicer to
leave them presuming it was just read off the NNTP server right then
(which it can be at the moment).
It's a two stage process at the moment:
   - server reads news at some chosen internval and creates database
     of article number, subject field, and message-id field for
     subject fields which look like eternity documents.
   - some user comes along and types a URL which matches the chosen
     hash.  Server fetches document from NNTP or local news spool
     using the article number as looked up in the database.  Depending
     on the eternity.conf setting for cacheing (on/off/encrypted) and
     the document setting (on/off/encrypted) the document will be
     either not cached, cached in clear, or cached in encrypted form
     (with sha1( 1 ) where  is the url of the document).
I could change it to a single stage process so that eternity documents
are immediately cached.  This is something easy to change, which could
be done if people got trigger happy with cancels and it was affecting
things.  Then you would be left with cancel wars :-) The eternity
server would grab the article at first opportunity though.
Later versions of the software will have to exchange documents
somehow, so then as long as one server saw the document before someone
cancelled it you'd be ok.
Clearly you could have an email submission channel where you just
email the article to a server, but that gets away from the idea of
pointing the finger at USENET.  (Cacheing is somewhat protected in
legislation even, because it's just a USENET document, and all you're
doing is cacheing it according to some cache replacement policy).
Some more technical explanations of what's going on encryption wise,
is that articles in the news spool have an outer encryption layer
which encrypts in one of these two ways:
   1) with pgp -c and password "eternity"
   2) with pgp -c and password of sha1( "1" )       where url is the document url
Inside this encryption layer is the document options (document url,
per document cacheing policy, and a marker of whether the document is
exdirectory or not (exdirectory docs not listed on document list).
Plus an optional pgp key, and the ascii armored, optionally signed
There is an optional inner layer of encryption, the ascii armored
signed document can optionally be encrypted:
   3) using a user selected passphrase
Option 1) provides little more protection than rot-13.  But should be
of some use in that it prevents the less clued from reading the
documents out of USENET directly.
Option 2) means that you need to know the URL before you can access
the document.  Without the URL, you're hosed.
Perhaps the URL is easy to guess, perhaps it's not:
Option 3) means that you need the passphrase to read the document in
addition to the URL.  This has similar effect to having a garbled URL,
choose a hard to guess passphrase.
You can turn on SSL at the eternity server, but that means you're
still trusting the operator, and root on the system.
To do it properly, you'll need a local eternity server if you want to
good security of encrypted documents.  Easy enough to run a local
eternity server if you're using linux on a ppp or permanently
connected machine.  My development machine is a ppp connected linux
However I'm not sure having passphrases is that good of an idea,
because it'll be furtively passed around amongst the community of the
person who submitted the documents, but that can always leak out.
And people using non-local eternity servers will be revealing the
shared passphrase to the server admin, (and to the snooping world, if
the server isn't running with SSL turned on).
Turn of logs, and introduce forward secrecy into mixmaster.  Easy to
do.  Why don't we have it yet?  (Ulf?  Lance?)
Then you have as true security as you can get from a digital mix with
the parameters mixmaster has.
Don't do too many regular updates of your eternty web pages for very
high risk situations.  Engineered network outages could show you up
quickly even if you were using a DC-net covering 1 million users.
Does the above answer your concerns about security?
Medium term software development-wise the eternity servers are going
to have to exchange documents between themselves.  At that point
USENET will be functioning mostly as hard to tamper with distribution
channel.  The rest will be a distributed USENET caching system, with
cache policy determined by popularity of document (hit count), and by
ecash payment.
Longer term perhaps some of Ross Anderson's more advanced ideas can be
added, as discussed by Ryan Lackey in the thread entitled "distributed
data store, a la eternity".

If the machine hosting the eternity server also has a mail2news
gateway (eg replay has mail2news at replay.com), then modify the
mail2news program to forward a copy to eternity at replay.com for
newsgroups that the eternity server is interested in.
That way it's still a USENET post.  Just you're stacking the odds

Indeed.  Similar perhaps to web based remailer interfaces, you can turn on SSL,
but you're still trusting the server, relying on no hackers being able
to crack it, and relying on your estimate of the authenticity of it's
If there got to be a _lot_ of eternity documents this might get
impractical.  You wouldn't have the disk space for them all.
The distributed USENET cacheing setup could use cope with a big
archive because the content could also be distributed, and forwarded
on request.  So the complexities of doing something clever to allow
digital mixes to obscure your reading habits might come in again.
Incidentally, I think you could use the same methods to obscure
reading the virtual eternity web as you would use to obscure reading
the real web.  Eg. crowds,   just happens to be likely to end up hosting a load of "hot" stuff
which you might not want to be caught reading in some countries.
They might have a go at that yes.
That _is_ the technical solution!  (Disposable remailers).
Here's a repost of something I posted to remailer-ops on this topic at
around the time a few remailer operators felt the heat.  Nothing new
proposed, but this kind of argument was being hashed out here on
cypherpunks years ago, and we still don't have any disposable
remailers.  As close as we've got that I know is perhaps some
psuedo-anonymous remailer operators running off of cyberpass (Lance
offers anon shell accounts for ecash).
remailer-ops repost:
The solution is to have disposable tents, lots of.
What about AOL disks?  We need shorter lived, disposable remailers as
exit remailers...  Let them take the heat, while the real remailers
walk.  Lets see a series of "exitman" remailers.  Exitman remailers
are walking targets left to fend for themselves as long as they may.
I propose that an exit remailer is replaceable, that is another
remailer can instantly step into it's place and take traffic.  The way
to do this is to have a special automated reporting mechanism for
exitman remailers.  An easy way to do it is to have the exitman
remailers send mail to a given mailing list.  Other remailers which
wish to use exitman remailers just subscribe to the chosen mailing
list.  We just need a remailer command indicating the creation of a
new exitman remailer.  I guess the exitman remailer just sends one
message per day, or whatever, and if it stops, you write it off.
Is there a military term for something sent in to get shot to bits,
just to distract attention from other movement?  A decoy?
Also, what about camouflaging the disposable tent, so the camal can't
find it to poke it's nose in?  How about SMTP mail forgeries.
Wouldn't addresses of remailer42 at dev.null fool a lot of these censorous
I wonder if system admins in general would be very interested in
tracking down SMTP forgeries for censors?  If it was obvious what the
censorous shill was up to, or the large ISP sysadmin was just plain
overloaded with work he may just shrug his shoulders and say sorry,
can't be traced, get over it.

@_subject: anti-spam law implies laws against remailers? (was Re: bulk postage fine) 
Difficult to do.
However, consider:
1) Government anti-spam laws won't work (too many loop holes,  of
   which is there are other countries in the world other than US,  is
   remailers will be used which will leave remailer operator rather than
   spammer to face the music).
2) When the government or whoever wants to sue someone for spam they
   will have to prove who the spammer is.  (Right?)  So now they'll
   look at the From address at it will say remailer at foo.com.  So
   they'll go have a chat to Fred Q Cypherpunk who operates foo, and he
   won't be able to cooperate because he doesn't keep logs.  They won't
   be happy with Fred, and will pass this information along to him by
   stealing his equipment, prosecuting him for assisting in a felony
   crime (they'll make it a felony right?), lock him and throw away
   the key.  But what about Freds constitutional protection of the
   speech forwarded by his remailer?  (Judge + congress-critter:
   Constitution wassat?)
3) Repeat step 2 x 100 and "something will have to be done" about the
   remailers (if there are any left!)  It really isn't that far
   fetched to have laws against remailers in the US.  Not so long ago
   the guy from the two-man band Georgia EFF were telling us about how
   they fought some law which had already tried to do this in that
   state.
4) New laws nearly always reduce your freedoms - in phrasing the law,
   and compromising their way around whatever "issues" they try to
   construct, they'll try to hide something else in there which we don't
   want.  (eg no encrypted email, or no import of crypto, or something
   stupidly unrelated -- happens all the time).

Sending mail is your problem alright.  It's where you get hit by
spammers etc.
Wasn't there an email forgery web page around for a while.  The idea
was that you filled in the details of who you wanted to send to, what
address you wanted it to appear you had sent it from, and paste your
message in this form box.  It did some kind of crude sendmail forgery
for you.
No problem -- run it through  first :-)
You'd not want to use the same public access account regularly.
I think the connecting to the web based interface of one of those free
web gateways via  web based interface has potential.
However I wonder how long it will last...  I mean rocket mail or
whatever admins are going to get complaints like you do as a remailer
If it gets bad, they'll do what?  Not sure -- yank your account?  You
could get another one...
Turn the whole thing off?
Might last for a while.
Really we could do with some more general distributed solution to the
delivery problem.
Email forgeries seem like an interesting solution, either via an
exitman remailer which is basically just an email forging service, or
perhaps we could add capability "forger" to the remailer code.
How much trouble can you get in with ISPs for forging email?  Do they
care?  Would wide-spread practice of forging to avoid getting spammed
in USENET would cover you well enough?  How much extra security would
it give you?  Probably quite a lot -- the sorts of person who gets
spam baited is clueless almost by definition, and won't have a clue
where the mail came from.  Unless they enlist some technical help,
they'll be forced to just discard the email.

@_subject: disposable remailers (was Re: Eternity Uncensorable?) 
Uggh another post which turned out hugely long... I cc'd to remailer
ops due to remailer operator relevance.
Good point, they could indeed.
There is another related problem which is a real thorny one:
  Being exit only, the attacker will by definition know the email
  address the messages it forwards are being sent to.  The attacker is
  trying to maximise his ability to disrupt, so he will be trying extra
  hard to conceal from remailer operators and their community that he is
  disrupting.
  Clearly the clever attacker in this situation, trying to disrupt the
  exitman-using middleman remailers reliability will let through
  anything going to a public forum, or to an email address he suspects
  is anything to do with Raph's pinging service.  (Eg any address on the
  cypherpunks list or remailer-ops list as possible collaborators in the
  remailer reliability pinging).
  If the attacker is a Fed or spook or whatever, he will have good
  resources and ability to correlate destination email addresses to
  cypherpunks list members.  Eg you get an account somewhere, they can
  find out by looking at your credit card logs, or whatever.
1) Counter measure    A sop I can offer to this difficulty of detecting denial of
   service attacks, is that perhaps you could have the last middleman
   remailer send to a bunch of different randomly selected exitman
   remailers.  So when you get some anonymous mail you get 10 copies of
   it.
   That way you can work out some stats for how likely someone who is
   operating 10 of 20 exit man remailers is to stop a given mail
   getting through.
 1a) Counter-counter measure to 1)
     However if some of these remailers are operating from cracked
     accounts, rather than from anonymously purchased accounts, the
     attacker has an easy job of increasing his percentage of exitman
     remailers: take out the existing ones.  Simple just email the admin
     of the cracked account -- he'll remove it.
2) Counter measure    Another idea, but really quite manual, would be to pick people who
   have advertised PGP keys, send them mail via some exitman remailer,
   and ask them politely to forward it to you.
   (Clearly sending through requests to "let me know if you recieve
   this email" aren't going to be recognized by the attacker, and let
   through if we send mail to people who don't have encryption
   capability).
 2a) Counter-counter measure to 2)
     Course then the attacker can counter by letting through any
     encrypted mail without question.  Stuck there aren't we :-(
3) Counter measure    Scraping the barrel here: what if we enlist the help of exitman
   remailers to check up on other exitman remailers?
   So now lets say we don't release a list of exitman remailers, but
   rather each exitman remailer privately announces itself to one
   randomly selected remailer privately.
   This is better in general because there is now no publically known
   list of exitman remailers.  It is now harder for someone to
   use the list to just email all the admins in the hope that they
   will revoke paid for accounts (attacker makes legal threats,
   claiming to have receiving illegal material from this account or
   whatever), or to remove hacked accounts (real easy this one).
   With this setup we can send mail to one exit man via another one,
   with some chance that the first exitman won't recognize the other
   exitman.  (You wouldn't want to overdo it with repeated mail, or
   the corrupt exitman might start to suspect the mail was another
   exitman).
  3a) counter-counter measure to 3)
      It might be relatively easy for the well funded attacker to work
      out which addresses of those it receives to forward to are
      accounts with exitman installed.  Eg. Watch the traffic from the
      host, after sending a bunch messages through remailers.  Or
      simply finger the account see if the user ever logs in.  (If it
      was hacked, it could be an active account, the user might never
      look at the forward file with |/home/oliver/... , nor the
      exitman remailer installed as "..." in some directory -- if it's
      working properly they won't see the email, and if it's forging
      email well they see replies).  Incidentally exitman remailer
      hidden in "..." would allow a user to install it himself and
      plausibly claim ignorance, a more subtle way to obtain
      "disposable" exitman remailers.  Best run from clearly
      non-technical users accounts with the knowing assistance of a
      technical assitant.
4) counter measure    An exitman remailer pinging service would be easily feasible for
   the post to USENET aspect (or to known mailing list), as the
   exitman remailer would show itself up quickly in this case.
   However I'm not sure this is so useful as mail2news gateways, and
   public postings generally (*) generate a lots less agro for their
   operators than a remailer.  This is because people don't have to
   read USENET, and don't feel nearly so threatened as when they
   receive an anonymous mail aimed at them.  And also because the
   mail2news gateway puts the senders address in the From field, which
   points the finger at the exit remailer anway.  mail2news seems to
   be viewed as more neutral.  If any mail2news operators have
   experiences which suggest otherwise I'd be interested to hear.
   (*) I did read of one case on remailer-operators where someone got
       hit by a remailer hater who used a remailer to post a fake
       advertisement of a CD full of commercial warez.  The
       remailer-hater then anonymously tipped off the SPA.
   Incidentally I say "remailer-hater" here, but I should probably use
   a more term "remailer-attacker" or something, there could also
   feasibly be someone who is actually on our side (in a Zen sort of
   way) and trying to get us to face and solve the DoS and operators
   liability issues with technical solutions by demonstrating the
   current weaknesses.
Some of these attacks are interesting for ordinary remailers also.
Perhaps there exist right now normal (non-middleman) remailers which
will send to another remailer in case it is a ping message, and
anything that looks like an attempt to deliver to Raph, but junk the
Would we know?
Anyway, overall I think the difficulty in checking on exitman
remailers overall probably means that this simplest practical
compromise for mail delivery from exitman remailers is for the last
middle man remailer to send the mail to multiple exitman remailers.
I also think the that the idea of exitman remailers privately
announcing themselves to selected remailers might mean that they last
longer, otherwise remailer haters will contact the admins and cause
hassle even if they can't correlate any particular message came from a
given remailer due to good mail forgery on the part of the exitman
And using exitman remailers to post to USENET might be useful at some
point if open access mail2news gateways got scarce.
In theory yes.  Send it via a couple of exitman remailers to make sure
if you like.  However the smart DoS attack described above is much
harder to counter.
Nope.  The client won't need to know.  You're not expected to send
directly to an exitman remailer.  That is something for remailer
operators to use.
You know how middleman operators work...  they always, always send
mail via another remailer and never deliver mail to a user.  (I'm not
sure if they detect this by looking to see if the address is on the
remailer list, or just always add an extra hop?)
So if there are some exitman remailers, a remailer operator that gets
sick of the heat can switch to a new kind of middleman mode, where he
always posts everything through various exitman remailers.  (Or normal
middleman mode, and leave the hassle of installing software to keep up
to date on current exitmen to other exitman-using middleman

  "posts through remailer when asked to deliver to anybody other than

remailer who's published address was a nym account on a nymserver?
That'd be a "hidden middleman".
Dimitri suggested on cypherpunks in the last round of discussion of
this sort of thing another variation on that -- that you could deliver
the mail if the person had a PGP public key on the keyservers --
whether the email was encrypted or not.  On the assumption that people
who use PGP would be unlikley to complain of anonymous mail.
He also suggested beefing up keyserver submission checks (there are
none right now) so that you need a replyable address to submit a key,
otherwise the remailer-baiter just posts a key generated with their
"victim's" email address on it prior to sending to them.

Because there is a from address people get picky that it ought to
contain a valid return address.  Many ISPs apparently have policies
which state that you aren't allowed to do SMTP forgeries.
Paper mail doesn't have this expectation.  Pity the people who
designed SMTP didn't leave this one out -- at this point it would be
difficult to get a From field added.  They could have followed the
paper mail norm and left it to the user to include (or not) whatever
contact info he wanted.  Of course you can see the natural convenience
of a From, or Replyto field, which is why it's there.
Now that the from field is there, it'll be even harder to remove from
implementations and protocols... basically impossible.
Still the spam counter-measure which many people are starting to use
of forging headers to avoid getting their email snarfed helps reduce
the expectation that the From field will contain anything useful.
However that isn't the only problem... the series of Received headers
allow those with the know how to recognise and narrow down where
forged mail came from.  But usually only to a mail hub where it was
injected at best, and then often only tentative with out collaboration
with involved sites.
Course Received: headers have their uses also, to debug sendmail
configs, and work out where mail is going.  Still would have been nice
if the feature was only included in the SMTP delivery stuff when
debugging mode was turned on.
I hope you're right.
I still think laws against spam are the wrong approach, even if the
courts declare remailers as delivery mechanisms only.

@_subject: a decentralised dejanews 
As you'll know if you read some of the previous eternity verbiage I've
generated over the last few days, the design is evolving as ideas are
bounced around.
To recap briefly:
  The eternity implementation at the moment is performing the function
  of a cache of USENET, which also `reformats' messages to extract and
  deliver the content as web documents.
  The cache has no replacement policy.  Planned replacement policies
  where least accessed documents, and/or the document accompanied by
  the smallest ecash payment.
Obvious problem:
  The cache will fill up and material will be discarded when the
  eternity document store grows too large for one machine to cache.
  My last thoughts on how to fix this was to have collaboration
  between the eternity servers: they ask each for documents they
  don't have.  They act like a distributed raid file server with
  redundancy.
  Clearly with the "least accessed" replacement policy they'll all
  likely cache similar material, and documents will still fall off the
  cache.
  Ecash payment for cacheing might work reasonably well, if you buy as
  much redundancy as you wish by including cash for several servers.
  Or perhaps a random cache replacment policy is the simplest to keep
  even spread of availability of documents.
  k of n secret sharing could be used at some overhead so that no one
  site is responsible for serving a given document.
  However it is fairly complex to design and implement such a system
  which can provide full underdisturbed service with nodes dynamically
  leaving and joining, and it is also difficult to protect fully
  against denial of service attacks.
Recap on old idea of using dejanews and altavista
  You will recall that earlier discussions talked about using dejanews
  or altavista as archives to fetch documents from.  I rejected this
  initial idea because altavista and dejanews take steps to reduce
  their disk space usage, by stripping out UU and radix-64 encoded
  documents.  Now we can fool them easily enough by waging a running
  battle of increasingly sophisticated textual stego on our side vs
  playing catch up with cleverer eternity document spotters on their
  part.  We might even win long term if we public key encrypted the
  documents for specific eternity servers.  Kind of messy.  Old
  content will be disappearing if they go back and filter out old with
  the new filters.
  However is another important reason not to use altavista or dejanews:
  it's not decentralised.  If something sufficiently hot gets
  published they'll both be taken off line long enough to figure out
  how to disable access to eternity.  Even if they can't do it
  ultimately because of sufficiently advanced public key text
  steganography, it'll disrupt the service.
Viewing the situation more modularly:
  The eternity service with a distributed raid file server formed from
  the respective caches has one problem: of acceptability.  Each
  server is actually holding eternity material, it tries to get away
  with this by claiming that it is a cache.  However each server is
  serving three potentially separable functions:
    - document cache
    - node in a distributed news archival service, but only for
      messages which look like eternity articles
    - a view on the database to allow it to be viewed interactively as
      web documents (fetching and translating decoding eternity
      documents to serve as web pages)
  The first function -- a document cache could probably just as well
  be served by a standard proxy cache.  Not a big issue, it's easy
  either way.
  The second function makes it hard to claim you are `just cacheing
  USENET' -- you're also creating a distributed archive of a
  very particular subset of it.
  And the third function, viewing the database, is somewhat like a
  specialised search engine.  The search engine functionality is 100%
  replicatable at practically zero storage overhead, and pretty good
  as a non-censorable element of the system.  100% redundancy of
  service each node has nothing that can't be replaced. A distributed deja-news replacement
  So after separating the functionality it becomes apparent that we
  could have a another model.  Actually try to start a distributed
  deja-news replacement, an complete eternal record of _everything_
  that _ever_ gets posted to news.  Dejanews is kind of doing that,
  except that it's not complete -- they are stripping out uuencoded
  files, etc.
  Also this would be distributed, and harder to coerce.
  So what are the storage requirements?  What does dejanews have in
  their machine room?  (Huge raid server?  How many Gigs?).
  I'm wondering if 1000 academic nodes, small and large ISP nodes, and
  indivduals each contributing 1Gb each could out perform deja-news.
  That'd be 1Tb.  How long would 1Tb last at the being consumed at a
  rate of a full USENET feed?  As disks get cheaper, next two years or
  so, people can upgrade disks to 10Gb disks or whatever is cheap at
  the time.
  You would want some redundancy, more than redundancy than dejanews
  needs in their raid fileserver, because nodes may come and go, and
  the number of nodes could fluctuate.
On top of distributed news archive, build an eternity service
  So with the eternal news archive, you now have everything you need
  to easily build an eternity server.
How practical is this?
  How much interest is there likely to be in creating a full USENET
  archive as a distributed net based effort.  It's clearly got vastly
  larger storage requirments than storing the full set of eternity
  articles posted to USENET.  However it has wider uses, and has lots
  of innocuous reasons to exist.  I guess it's quite an interesting
  project in it's own right.  You could start with just some
  newsgroups, and build up as a way to boot strap it.  But it may be
  harder to generate enough interest to deploy this than to deploy
  enough eternity servers to do build a distributed archive of just
  eternity articles.
How soon could it happen?
  Who knows.  What do people reckon the interest would be in a
  distributed complete USENET archive for it's own sake.  For purposes
  of the archive cancels would not be applied.  Indeed archive the
  cancels too, and the control messages for everyone to see for
  perpetuity who did and said what.
Best way forward?
  Perhaps it will be more realistic to build a distributed archive for
  eternity documents only first.  If it is designed as a separate service,
  then it could be the same software to do either, just restrict it to
  alt.anonymous.messages, or just for alt.anonymous.messages passing a
  filter program.

I dunno.  It could be for a number of reasons, you'd have to do a
survey of the warez d00dz that hang out on IRC channel  to see
why they don't do it.
I guess it's because they find easier to trade with DCC commands in
  I had a look at a  session in progress some time ago,
and the trades were going down every few minutes.  Take a look.
Especially games trades but also high price DTP and photo retouching
stuff.  You'd see `trade quark-Xpress 8 for registered quake' or
whatever come up a few times, and then it'd stop, and that handle'd
say thanks I've got it now.
IRC is less main stream, and these folks don't like the lime light
because they know that their 'warez trading habits are frowned upon by
Another reason is that why should they bother, what's their
motivation?  They aren't making money from it I don't think, they're
just after copyright software without paying for it.  It's probably
just that the most efficient market for leveraging what they have got
copies of via trades is on IRC right now.
Another class of pirate is the Chinese (it is Chinese who do this
yes?) who make CDs full of commercial software and sell it way under
market price.
Perhaps that class of pirate would take off if the net bandwidth was
up to it.  Their next problem would be to control access to their
anonymous eternity page to allow themselves to get some money from it.
Perhaps eternity servers could be set up to charge for downloads and
pass back money to the anonymous poster.  But then how do you stop
someone else reposting it and charging a lower price?  Well you can't.
But that's all what recursive auction markets are about.  The reaches
a point of diminishing returns, and the user can buy freshly released
products more quickly from the first non-copyright abiding software
reseller, or they can buy it more cheaply if they wait as the price
falls over a few days.
Eric Hughes apparently gave a talk at a hacker con some time back
about UIPS `Universal Internet Piracy Service'.  I think his ideas
were to explore the financial aspects of trading system for illicit
software.  He wasn't planning to put up a distributed document store,
but to have an distribution medium were there was a continuous flow of
information.  As long as the information could still get through in
the face of hostilities from copyright police, it was doing it's job
and the software could be traded.  I don't think he's released
software yet, and I don't think there's any papers available on the
net, but it was still an active idea last I heard.
Yup.  Actually it'll be much more convenient because it will disappear
out of the news spool presently, and the eternity servers might get to
the stage where they keep a virtual raid file server implemented by
exchanging documents from their caches, and can archive the most
popular stuff.
So because it's more convenient it's even less defensible as it's
providing some part of this service.
See the post about building a distributed dejanews replacement for
another approach to this problem which is probably more defensible.
Might turn out to be a better way if your suspicions prove correct.

@_subject: some hashcash advocacy (was Re: anti-spam law implies laws against remailers?) 
I wasn't talking about remailers above, but about end users.  Hashcash
allows the recipient to filter out email that hasn't got postage.
As an interim upgrade path ISPs adopting it could be to bounce
messages with out payments, and include a nonce, and instructions to
resend including the nonce.  Set up the filter so that the second post
gets through.  Spammers often don't have forged reply addresses for
obvious reasons.  (If spam crept up too badly in-spite of this you could at that point
disable non-hash cash postage and give a URL for a java implementation
where they just go to the web page and their browser will generate
them some hash cash.  Obviously this is inconvenient so I would be
interested to see how the spammers adapted to just the nonce first.
It's much easier to block spammers if they have to include replyable
email addresses.)
You would also have a no-postage list, for mailing lists etc.
If we arrange so that spam won't get through without payment, it
disincentivizes spammers.  If some users go running around asking for
`government to do something about spam', it could be suggested to them
that it would be more effective to ask their ISP to install a hashcash
patched sendmail.
A remailer won't answer the bounce with nonce, so you automatically
won't get remailer traffic without postage -- unless you put remailers
on your no-postage list.
If you're some media celebrity and you get too much email -- just turn
up the squech, increase the postage required rate, and add people you
do want to your no-postage list.
You could auto-add anyone you ever manually replied to to the
no-postage list even.
I think the easiest initial way for the spammer to continue spamming
you would be to target mailing lists, using forged addresses.
Spam on mailing lists instead of mail is also a good thing for us,
because we already have solutions for spam on mailing lists:
decentralised 3rd party ratings -- NoCeMs can be applied to mailing
lists.  Allowing us to recommend good posts or mark what we consider
spam.  Individual users can decide which rating service to use.
If you consider that hashcash can be setup to only charge postage for
people you have never replied to in the past, this heavily
discriminates against people who send large amounts of mail to random
people.  (Which is precisely the spammers mailing pattern!)
Another solution with real ecash is to send ecash payment with mail
and have filters that will similarly bounce messages if there is no
The recipient by societal convention is expected not to cash the
payment.  People who cash your money you don't tend to send more email
to.  You could easily charge $1 and that would be a high price for the
spammer -- it would be cheaper to snail mail you the spam.
The above doesn't seem very friendly, or very in keeping with the
spirit of free discourse.  I think hashcash is nicer in this respect.
I've taken the stuff on eternity to another message.

@_subject: some hashcash advocacy 
Yes, if you like.  If techie people can make themselves pretty much
immune to spam, perhaps the non-techies will get interested to use our
solution.  Make it easy enough to install at ISP level, and interim
migration paths for people without it so it still interoperates, and
you might get somewhere.
All depending on how spammers and hashcash interact when they bump
into it as a major block on their ability to spam.  They'll obviously
try their damnest to work around it.  But I think that the
inconvenience and cost to them, as hardly anyone ever replies to their
mail (costs are only for first email that isn't replied to), is a much
better spam preventer than the current status quo, which has
practically no protection other than manual blocking lists which
hardly anyone has software installed for, or for complaints to
ISPs... but then the spammers use forged email addresses, and there
are a few ISPs who apparently (from discussion here) are willing to
knowingly sell spammers bandwidth.  Someone's going to do it.
It's supposed to be 100% decentralised -- the network strain on any
kind of centralised clearling house for postage for _all_ email would
be Terrabits/second.
OK, so you might be able to split it up a bit, and have multiple
banks, and inter-bank clearing, and various trade-offs, but it's still
a major engineering effort with large bandwidth overheads.
You missed one aspect of the design.  What the collision is calculated
on is the recipients email address.  If the collision is on someone
elses email address, you reject it out of hand.  So the hashcash
postage token is specificly minted by the sender and made out in the
email address of the individual that you are trying to send email to.
It is useless for sending email to anyone else.  You can never spend
it twice on the same person, and sending it to anyone else it will
have zero value.  Also it includes in the hash collision an expiry date when you
generate it, but this is not significant to the email spam control
aspect, but is just there to ensure that the users double spend
database doesn't grow -- you discard expired double spend entries --
as you wouldn't accept them anyway -- because they are out of date.
ISP level checking is nice because you can get away with out changing
email clients.  The short term solution of sending nonces will help
provide a reasonable solution for those with out new clients.
tit-for-tat would be reasonable also.
Stable identities already have advantages... you can block remailers
Stable identities could include signed documents.

You ended up looking at an empty file, and none the wiser.  It could

at it in less before loading it into emacs.

I deleted it or something, and haven't been able to find it again, and

You can get creative about how you reference material with the web
For example say that you set up a page which contains your criticisms,
plus large chunks of, or the whole copyrighted document, using some
kind of inline web text directive.
It's the users web browser which is putting the parts together, the
copyright holders web server is serving some parts of the page, your
server is serving other parts.
For a visual example of this, check out:
The inline image is in the UK, the rest of the page is on Lance's
machine.  The reason for this one is that the image is ITAR/EAR
sensitive, and Lance's machine is in the US.
Is it possible to include text in a web page?  I know you can do
images (as in the above example) by doing:

the various parts of the current "page" were coming from.
Anyway, the copyright police, WIPO, SPA etc. are the enemy in my book.
The difficulty of trying to applying these old laws to the internet

to "give" longer term to adjust to reality.  Legislation against

@_subject: coercion proof timestamping services 
Just some thoughts about creating more robust time-stamping services.
Current time stamping services just generate a PGP key, and sign any
messages you send them.  PGP signatures already include a time stamp.
Problem: if we find some interesting uses for time-stamps where it
becomes important that no one can coerce the timestamping service into
back-signing timestamps in the past, the current timestampers will be
able to comply, or as they are automated services, simply confiscating
the machine will likely give the attacker all information required to
back date any number of time-stamps.
One solution to this is for the time-stamper to publish all
time-stamps (they are quite small being detached signatures), and
publish a siganature on all the time-stamps stored in one file each
day.  Perhaps even publish the signature in a newspaper.  Anyone with
that newspaper, or an archive of the master signature only, will be
able to verify any claimed time-stamps -- the publically published
hash (in the signature) must match the time-stamps archived for that
Another way is perhaps to have a sequence of keys for signing
time-stamps on each day, and to discard the private key after that
day.  Authenticate the use-for-one-day-only keys by signing with a
long term key.  If people archive daily keys, the coercion of
timestamping service will be detected if it attempts to publish a
daily key for some date in the past, and the timestamping service
can't sign with old keys as it has purposely discarded the private

I was going to rant about the negative evolutionary pressures, but I
kept it short.  I agree fully.
There are a few evolutionary pressures, but they are insignificant
compared to all the negative pressures.
Positive examples?  - motorbike riding
- aggresive drivers
- manic depressives
- mountain climbers
- hard drug takers
- drug pushers
- DEA agents
A couple of those don't deserve the negative evolutionary pressures
they surely inflict upon themselves or inherit, a couple do.
There are lots of things around which will kill you slowly, or offer
you a measurable though small chance of dying young, but this usually
doesn't affect that persons chances of reproducing.  Examples might be
smoking, heavy drinking, overeating, etc.
So start collecting guns and doing target practice.  Intelligence
includes ability to adapt and forsee likely future events.
Not taking my own advice here owning no guns.  My wife is a crack shot
though from pistol target shooting.  Problem is they're trying to
outlaw most/all types of target pistol over here.
Have lots of children .. to counteract the welfare cases tendencies.
Mormon polygamy?  Harem?
(Again not following own advice, only two children ... so far).
The problem is that from a purely scientific evolutionary point of
view, the human race is surely regressing, the masses of negative
evolutionary pressures are certainly pushing this way.
Welfare cases in the UK are encouraged to hav children by the way the
system is structured.  A single mother is the highest priority case,
with pretty much guaranteed 16 years of preferential treatment, higher
payouts, higher on housing priority lists, and so on.  Female
divorcees with children often get more money, better accomodation, and
more extra fringe benefit handouts than they would ever have married.
Welfare is better than the minimum wage earners lot by a significant

negatively structure the welfare hand out system to discourage them.
You could scrap the welfare system.  They already offer free birth

The real problem is that the pervasive bleeding heart
socialist/communist welfare system mentality will ensure that you'll

@_subject: lack of evolutionary pressures 
I can see sufficiently small populations evolving quickly because in a
small population -- say 10 monkeys -- the monkey which got run over by
a truck because it was deaf, splat, end of deaf monkey gene, if it's
the only one.
But over large numbers say 700,000 or whatever, I can't see that it
makes much difference whether it's 700,000 or 7 billion.
I would've thought at that point it's more to do with the proportion
of the population with the genetic feature in question and the
magnititude of evolutionary pressure exerted by that feature.  Clearly environment affects this, and a large population is more
likely to be geographically dispersed, and hence less prone to sudden
adverse environmental changes.
So if 10% of the hominids by chance have an genetic characteristic
which increases their chances of `hacking it' long enough to propogate
their genes with no trees to 90% as compared to 20% for those without
this characteristic, clearly that gene set is going to propogate
pretty damn fast.
You could get some pretty fast propogation even in a population of 7
billion.  If there were an AIDs like virus with a airborne common cold
propogation vector, and a year incubation period, and 1% of the
population had some quirky genes which just happened to make them
immune to it, well that 1% gene would propogate very quickly.
There are currently practically no physical genetic advantages which
radically affect ability to breed (apart from extreme ones which mean
near certain death).  So yes, it's stagnant from that point of view.
There are however significant pressures exerted by different cultures,
which have different genetics.  Some cultures shun the idea of birth
control, and tend to have 2 or 3 times more children than average
educated westerners.  If that statistic holds for a few generations
there will be a lot more people around from these cultures.  There are
I think enough genetic differences between european genes and arabs,
asians as an example that I think it would be reasonable to argue that
this is having an effect on the human gene pool.
It is our collective shared memes which are suffering large scale
negative evolutionary pressures.  Be socially responsible, global
warming, food shortages, have few children.  Lots of other reasons
people don't have so many children ... gets in the way of career, long
term chore, commitment etc.  Reasons for welfare recipients to breed
more welfare recipients.
That's a pretty interesting result.
Intelligence is an awfully hard thing to measure.  IQ tests and SAT
scores only show you what they test, ability to score at IQ test and
A change in cultural values, societal norms, and welfare structures
over a sustained period could start to have some effects.
(Cultural norms change -- one of my grandfathers, an englishman, was
one of 20 children -- this used to be much more common.  17 of them
made it to adult life).
Memes propogate in meme-space also.  The meme of global warming,
potential food shortages
Likely due be a number of effects, perhaps demonstrates that
intelligence and being exported from England don't necessarily
negatively correlate.  Also perhaps intelligence isn't that strongly
based on genetics.
There probably weren't any significant average genetic differences
between the freshly exported "scoundrels" by 18th century standards as
compared to the average genetic make up of english population.
Also I did hear that Hitlers super-race of children bred for selected
traits didn't work out that well.  Perhaps the environment they were
bought up in didn't help.  Are there any studies which demonstrate any difference in intelligence
between races even, asians, africans, chinese, europeans, red-indians

No.  Evolution is blind.  Evolution is just a word to describe the
fact that genes which result in an increased likelihood of death prior
to breeding tend to not to be passed on.
I was arguing that I think current evolutionary pressures tend to work
against the criteria for increasing intelligence.  This claim is
complicated by the fact that intelligence is hard to measure.  Lets
say we choose IQ tests for the sake of argument.  Then I'm not even
sure how secure the claim that ability to pass IQ test has a large
hereditary correlation, So I don't know whether children of parents
who both had IQ measured at > 200 necessarily have children with
higher IQ than where one parent was > 200 and the other < 200.
There are also difficulties in isolating inherited factors from
environmental factors.
Modern medicine tends I think to work against the criteria of
producing healthy specimens.  (People who would have died as children
due to hereditary defects, living on to have children thanks to
medicine.  Also people who can't breed, having medical assistance to
have children.  Caesarian sections for females with too narrow hips to
easily give birth.  Lots of other examples).
Similarly difficult to influence medical evolutionary pressures --

@_subject: distributed virtual bank 
An application I have put a bit of thought into is the idea of
creating a distributed banking system.  That is not offline, but not a
single centralised trusted bank either.  Ideally it is a system where
all nodes are equivalent, and k of n of those nodes have to collude
before they can compromise the operation of the bank.
This is related to the encrypted computation idea where I can ask you
to perform a computation for me, but you won't know the operands, and
I can recover the answer with a final transformation.  There are a few
such protocols around to compute certain functions.
This would be a distributed system, the nodes in the network would be
able to simulate a virtual CPU by exchanging messages and computing
encrypted functions.  The program you run on the virtual CPU is the
bank software.
One approach would be to simulate the CPU by using the exchange of
encrypted communications to simulate circuit functions in the CPU.
Hopefully there would be more efficient methods of performing this
securely distributed computation.
People would trust the bank by virtue of their belief that it would be
too difficult for an attacker to compromise or acheive sufficent
collusion to overcome the n of k threshold.
The bank would live in the network in this virtual CPU.  Individual
nodes may come and go, yet the secured software entity which is the
bank and it's account information would live on.
Comments on how feasible it would be to design such a system with
current crypto techniques?

Hash function seem be generally exportable, though they are several
constructs which allow you to convert a hash function into an

Probably one reason is that hash functions are used to create and
check signatures, and signature checking and making code

What James describes on the page is that he is storing the private EC
key in a file.  The file is optionally encrypted with a passphrase.
He also describes how the key file can be stored on floppy.  The term
he uses for the private key file is "secrets file".  This much is
fairly standard.
The novel feature is that he includes the PK with the signature.  I
consider this useful, in that if you ever receive a communication, or
read a post you wish to reply to you have all the information required
to reply without going to a keyserver.
You are vulnerable to MITM, but including a reasonable subset of the
WoT with a post is not an option due to size.
Another interesting option with EC is to derive the key from the
passphrase, then there is no private key file.
Most uses of PGP are subject to the same attack, because people do not
have enough web of trust connectivity.  PGP certificates give you the
tools to avoid MITM attacks when you knew someone before hand.
A widely deployed WoT generally makes MITM harder even when you
converse with people only electronically, because somebody knows them
in person, and this may be reflected in the WoT.
The fact that it is easy to fabricate a whole community of fictitious
people who know each other is interesting also.  One method you could
use to restrict this somewhat is to add a cost function to creating
identities.  A certificate proving certain monies have been paid for
the identity, or a hash collision over a certain size.
This is similar to including fingerprints at the bottom of posts.  In
some senses John Doe's web site, messages and postings define who he
is in cyberspace.
I strongly suspect it entails a high percentage of the use of PGP.
Very few people have WoT connections.
And there is the question of what a WoT link means.  The only people I
have direct WoT links to are people who I first met electronically.  I
wouldn't know them from Adam.  How do I know the person I met is the
real Ian Goldberg, or whoever.  Also an inherent problem is that just because I met Ian Goldberg once
does not mean that all the people he signs keys of are who he thinks
they are.
The problem of preventing MITM can be viewed as the task of making the
MITM's job difficult, and making it difficult for the MITM to perform
many MITMs at once.
One way to go about this is to distribute your belief of other peoples
keys.  The potentially helps to strengthen the WoT because you may
work your way around the MITM by a link he does not control.  For
example you could download the list of email addresses from a
keyserver and spam them all with the set of fingerprints of all the
public key ring that you use (or all of the keys on the keyserver).
Not that they would thank you for it, spamwise, but if there are in
existance any MITM's it could conceivably flush some out.
Another lower bandwidth method of making the MITM's job harder is to
sign and/or publish hashes of public key databases -- download the
keys, or some useful easily definable subset of keys on keyservers,
and publish the hash of them in as many media as possible (web,
finger, news, mail, newspapers, etc.)
For example if the operator of a public key database published a hash
of all the keys in his database in a widely available newspaper, the
MITM now has to make sure that John Doe doesn't see this newspaper, or
that the newspaper John sees has been reprinted espescially for him.
If John Doe is suspicious he will stop a random person in the street
and ask to see the key hash section breifly.
In general John Doe's strategy to avoid being the subject of a MITM
attack should be to be unpredictable in the channels he uses for
authentication and communication.
Let's say John buys a book on cryptography, and the author included
his fingerprint.  Then John could use this person to authenticate a
key with Alice.  He could write to the author, including a nonce with
the plaintext, and ask the author to check that the key he thought
belonged to Alice really did belong to her.
Interlock protocols are another method of complicating the MITM's
task.  If Joe develops the habit of posting the hash of messages he is
about to post a day in advance, the MITM must think of something to
say also, and publish the hash, so that it can publish something a day
As the MITM's messages now don't match with what Joe said, the MITM
has to lie some more to keep up the game.  We would like to overload
the MITM so that his task of lying becomes computationally infeasible.

@_subject: hashcash spam prevention & firewalls 
I am looking at writing some hashcash
( based spam prevention
software.  The motivation for writing spam prevention software is that
spam is better combatted with technical methods than legal or
political (we do not want clueless politicians coming in ham-fisted
and requiring "Internet Drivers Licenses" or anti-spam legislation or
anything else, such actions will be hazardous for the future of
remailers, in my opinion).
(Hashcash is a way of proving that the sender has consumed a tunable
amount of CPU time.  The verification process consumes negligible CPU
time.  This allows us to require the would be spammer to spend say 20
seconds per mail, which will slow him down considerably, over his
current tactics of 1000 long Bcc lists allowing him to hand off
spamming tasks to mail servers.)
So what we want is a filter to bounce messages without the required
hashcash postage, we ideally want this to happen at the ISP or
organisational SMTP server end, rather than at the recipients end,
because a) it is simpler for 1 service provider to install software
than 100,000 neophytes, and b) it reduces bandwidth consumption on
dial up users pay per second lines as the spam is killed before they
see it.
The Right Way to do it perhaps is as an SMTP extension, however I
consider this impractical in the short term because as far as I know
there is no SMTP extension plug-in mechanism (other than access to the
source code, and lots of development time) and because there are a
large number of mail servers in use, and it will be expensive in
developer (that's me) time to provide patches for them all
(exarcebated by the fact that in many cases source will not be
So these problems leave us scratching around for other more generic
approaches.  One method is to create a proxy which receives mail on
port 25 (as the SMTP server normally does) filters examining for
correct hashcash postage, and bounces if the postage is missing, and
forwards the mail on to the real SMTP server if the hashcash postage
is valid.  The real SMTP server would then be set to run on another
port... say port 26 which is reserved, and have the mail forwarded to
it at that port.  (You would want to disable non-local access to port
26 either at firewall or with SMTP server configuration if that is
Alternatively run the real SMTP server on another machine inside the
local network.
A few problems with this approach, firstly it may not be possible to
configure some SMTP server software to run at ports other than 25.  (I
know you can do it with sendmail: OOPort=26 does it.)  (If this is not
possible with a given SMTP server you can still run a proxy by running
the real SMTP server on another machine inside the network).
Secondly the proxy approach prevents some of the SMTP server functions
from operating properly because the process on the other end of the
socket is our hashcash proxy on localhost rather than the remote mail
hub (modern sendmails can be configured to perform reverse name
lookups on IP addresses, call ident (ident sucks anyway IMO), or block
based on IP address or domain, etc.)  Is this kind of thing likely to
be a big problem?
Another approach is to try to hook in a hashcash SMTP proxy filter at
the firewall.  I am not that familiar with firewalls.
Anyone have thoughts on the sorts of filtering you could install at
the firewall level, and how portable this would be based on installed
base of types of firewall?  (ie It is not interesting if you can do
nifty proxy functions with foobar firewall software if it is used by
<1% of sites, and the function is impossible with other firewall
The required filter functionality is something like this in order of
Accept the SMTP session.  Use an EHLO extension HASHCASH to say that
this server expects hashcash.  (Extended HELO is a method of
specifying SMTP extensions (I think)).  Accept the headers, and if a
valid hashcash postage is not included, hand off to the real
mailserver a site configurable bounce message.
If the postage is valid, replay the headers to the real SMTP server
(with IP masquerading so that the IP address appears to be coming from
the originator, so that the SMTP server will not get upset about
reverse DNS look up mismatches etc).  Then act as a dumb proxy for the
rest of the connection passing data through to the normal hashcash
This still leaves open the question of the user generating their own
hashcash postage.  Again this could be problematic for neophytes.  One
solution is to include a URL for a web page including a javascript
hashcash generator -- this means that no new software must be
installed, the user cut and pastes the generated hashcash into their
However things would be a whole lot simpler short term if the mail
originators ISP created the hashcash for him at the ISPs SMTP hub
where the user hands off his mail for further delivery.
The main problem with this is that the SMTP mail hub would be
overloaded by the CPU intensive task of generating hashcash.
There are a few techniques to reduce the overhead of preventing spam
with hashcash.  One is to require valid hashcash only on the first
message to a given address.  (Spammers being hit and run types, and
even having to generate hashcash for each spamee once would be
expensive for a spam list of 10 million unwilling spam recipients).
Better, is to require valid hashcash on all mail, _until_ the
recipient replies to a mail.  This is good because people rarely reply
to spammers.
Ordinary users who chit-chat backwards and forwards in mail generate
little added overhead for the hand off SMTP server -- the only
overhead being to generate say 5 seconds CPU worth of hashcash for
each new recipient the user sends to.
Then you add some hashcash accounting so that users who overspend
(consuming more than say 1 minutes CPU consumption on the server in a
24 hour period have their email bounced with explanation of how to
generate their own hashcash as a heavy user).
Figures would need tuning to see how they worked out in practice,
however it seems that it would be feasible to handle the whole
operation entirely at the sending and receiving SMTP servers.

@_subject: remailer hashcash spam prevention 
Remailers require a different strategy.  With remailers you are trying
to discourage spammers from using the remailer, with email you are
also trying to discourage spammers, but you have to do it in ways
which is easy for neophytes to cope with.
With remailers people already have to get new software, and all of the
source is available, so it is relatively easy for us to add
requirements for hashcash postage into type I remailers, in to
mixmaster, and newnym.  Hashcash was originally designed for this.
There is an implementation on Also Andy Dustman, who is the guy who administers the efga remailer
(right?) wrote a python interface to hashcash, and is keen on python
hacking.  I suspect efga remailer may even be written in python if
Andy had much to do with it :-)
So with remailers you insist that the sender generate the hashcash
with all of their remailer requests, you bounce it or silently trash
it if there is no valid hashcash.  Also I would highly recommend that
you use Ian Goldbergs exit man script for remailer delivery -- it
delivers via HotMail and other such free web based email systems, via
publically accessible proxies and ensures that your remailer address
doesn't appear in the headers where you are the exit remailer. Mailing lists you have to realistically I think not use hashcash for.
The majordomo process would become overloaded if it had to generate
hashcash for each recipient of each message.  Similarly the poster
would be over loaded if he had to generate hashcash for each recipient
of the message.  (I would not like to have to generate 1000 (or
whatever the current readership is ) of 20 second hashcash stamps to
post this message to cypherpunks for instance).
The way to cope with this in hashcash filters is to exempt mailing
lists from hascash requirement via a user administered allow list.
(You could possibly auto detect mailing lists at the hashcash filter
agent -- the subscription process could be detected -- or more risky
in that spammers might work out a way to abuse this -- by recognising
the pattern of mails -- lots of mails with the same Sender, and
different From fields.
I tend to argue against this include list -- remailers become less
useful if you can not send mail to anyone who can receive SMTP mail.
I prefer the exit man via HotMail approach to the send notification
that there is anonymous email ready to be picked up approach.
Yes.  This can work reasonably well because people do not reply to
spammers, and most email has a to and fro pattern.

Yes, I think this is a reasonable first pass.
Naturally as you suggest the foiled spammer will then target mailing
lists and newsgroups.
I tend to view this as less of a problem because these forums are
already noisy and tend to require filtering, or manual filtering by
skimming for posters you recognize anyway.
Also I understand collaborative ratings schemes like NoCeM can be
configured to work for mailing lists.  For people who don't want to
install new software (and that is most people in my experience, myself
included) can use filtering services.
For example if spam became a problem on cypherpunks it would be easy
for someone to set up yet another filtered cypherpunks list which
promised to filter purely on the commercial spam criteria.
The reputation of the available filtering services, and the paranoia
of various list members would ensure that any untoward filtering would
be called into question.

Their controversial GAK ready policy enforcer works as a a local SMTP
proxy.  You set up your normal SMTP server on another machine, and
configure the policy enforcer to forward mails to the normal SMTP
server.  Or presumably if you can configure your SMTP server to accept
connections on a port other than 25 you could have the SMTP enforcer
on the same machine.
The same thing could work for a hashcash filter, and it is one
feasible solution.
The functionality which is lost is the possibility for the sendmail to
be configured to do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address which is
connecting to it, and check that that domain is the same as the domain
in the From field.  Also ident lookups don't work anymore either.
However I am not sure how reliable either of these mechanisms are, and
I'm not sure that many people are using them because they would be
unlikely to be reliable in the general case.
So probably this is not a problem.
A local SMTP proxy to add hashcash on the way out should work fine.
The difference is that it allows the ISP which is hit by spam attacks
to install a hashcash filter.
With simple resource metering at the spammers ISP side, the spammers
typically abuse other peoples open SMTP agents to forward their spams
for them.
Their ISPs can do little about this.
Really it's best if the sender is left to generate his own hashcash,
the motivation for working out ways to have the originators ISP's
outgoing SMTP hub generate hashcash for them is that it is simpler to
install in the short term.

Well that would work clearly enough.  However I think there are a
number of technical problems to acheiving this.  Firstly SMTP does not
include authentication.
Secondly doing so reduces flexibility and many users use multiple
ISPs, forward their mail to various places, etc., and this kind of
stuff gets in the way.
Really we I think should be discouraging the control freak "positive
identification to use this port" syndrome such as the ident fuck up,
(Ident is a dumb method of identifying who is on the other end of a
socket on a unix box.  It opens up a socket to the ident port on the
originating machine, and asks who is on socket x port y?  The machine
can determine this from local OS tables, and sends the info back.
This works if the user does not have root on the machine.  Fortunately
this snoopy bastardised protocol is not doing so well these days
because there are more and more people who have root on their own
machines, and because there are so many windows machines which don't
know what a protected port number is.  This is good because Ident
sucks.) and moving instead towards, "who cares you are so long as you
can't overload my machine".  Moving longer term towards "who cares who
you are so long as I profit from your connecting to this port" aka
charge for port access with payer and payee anonymous ecash.  Then
everyone is welcome to use anywhere as a mail forwarding service --
spam becomes welcomed, and encouraged, too much custom and too low
bandwidth discouraging customers, the ISP will use the profits to
purchase a few more T3s.
Hashcash is the interim solution.
In the interim it is a fact of life that there are many many open SMTP
forwarding hubs.  The lack of software to configure them otherwise,
and inertia will ensure things remaing this way for some time.
Hashcash cuts out spam to your site (if you are an ISP), or to your
mailbox (if you are a user) even in an environment of an almost
unlimited supply of open SMTP hubs, and disposable ISP accounts,
because it puts the onus on the sender to consume more resources than
Authenticated the hell out of your ISP's SMTP as a forwarding hub
won't prevent your users getting spammed to death, nor will it reduce
the overall spam problem much because the spammers will just use one
of the other open SMTP servers.

The latter.  The originator provides all postage for one way
Nym reply block postage needs other mechanisms as described in a

Making the hashcash message dependent is interesting in that it
removes the need for a double spending database, because apart from a
DoS attack it is not interesting to the spammer to send you multiple
copies of the same mail, and in previous discussions someone suggested
it for this reason.
However, generally I have been assuming that it's easier to have a
double spend database, and to make the hashcash depend only on the
resource name for the kinds of problems you raise, and because it is
cheaper to verify hashcash on shorter strings.  By resource name I
mean whatever it is that is being used.  For an email address it is
the email address, for a remailer it is the remailers address.  Could
be generalised for other purposes, for example free use of web based
resources or even telnet based TCP/IP protocols in general.

See my post to Bill Stewart with I think you can construct ways to allow the ISP to reject messages
without postage, and to allow frequent users to be exempt, and to do
this such that there is no invited list which becomes a juicy target.
That is an interesting thought.  Well the interesting thought is that
it gives us a way to block spam at the list server, because a) the
spammer has to overcome the hurdle you described, and b) the list
operator could punish spammers who started spamming once getting over
the hurdle by blocking them.  The usual trick of switching to a
different address, or a remailer would not work because they would
still have to generate a new hashcash coin as the list operator could
block the coin.
I would however think that a large denomiation coin made out to the
list server would make more sense than generating lots of coins for
all of the list subscribers.
However there is a nasty side to the above, in that it encourages the
list operator to censor posts he considers spam.
It would be simpler and I think tend to less encourage censorship to
introduce a third party filtering service such as Ray Arachellian's,
and the other one, which had an option to have only spam filtered out.
At this moment in time the spam content on mailing lists I am on is
very low.  I get much more in email.
Doubtless this would change when spammers discovered that email spam
is too CPU expensive to use.
Also hashcash really doesn't work well for USENET.  NoCeM's are cool
things for USENET, a distributed ratings system, and I understand can

@_subject: remailer hashcash spam prevention 
Simplest thing to do for non-replyable remailers is to insist that the
originator include hashcash for each remailer hop.  Then remailers can
just refuse to remail anything unless there is a valid hashcash
postage token included.  For example:
Is a 20 bit hash collision on remailer at efga.org.  (Antonomasia sent me
a patch sometime back for hashcash which changed the hashcash syntax
which is easier to parse.  (He also simplified the command line
interface... mine is a bit scruffy)).
To send through remailer at efga.org and remailer at replay.com, you would
include a hashcash postage stamp for each remailer.
So you add to the remail instructions for remailer at efga.org a hashcash
postage stamp:
and to the nested encrypted remailing instructions for replay you add
a hashcash stamp for it too:
The originator must generate the hashcash for all hops.
The hashcash proposal was originally focussed on remailers, and for
this purpose it is suggested that the originator generate all postage.
I am not sure I understand the comment above.  Why should a reply
block always point to another reply block?
It provides pretty good security to have a newnym address which when
mail is sent to it, the newnym server looksup that nyms reply block,
and mails the message with that reply block prepended to the
designated first hop remailer.  The reply block chain can have several
hops, and can even end up in a newsgroup via a mail2news gateway, or
typeI remailer.
To point the whole reply block back to another newnym address adds
additional protection but I would have thought most people use only
one reply block.
A good point.
You have to restructure the payment to cope with this.  Here are a few
- One way to do it is to require the nym owner to pre-pay hashcash
postage for mails he receives.  When the postage runs out, the
delivery ceases.  However this provides a denial of service attack
against the newnym user -- just have more CPU than him and you can
prevent him getting any real replies by spamming him.
- Another is to require postage only for the entry remailer.  This
however begs the question of what is a remailer.  There are problems
with assuming there is some official list of "remailers".  For example
if I am a spammer and I want to spam I will call myself a remailer,
and spam via the other remailers from this vantage point apparently
within the fold, it will be difficult to detect me.  I might even
remail the odd message to keep up appearances.
- A distributed hashcash double spend database could allow remailers
to accept hashcash which wasn't directed to them specifically, but
rather, which was directed to any remailer.  Remailers would propogate
hashcash database updates.  This preserves anonymity because hashcash
says nothing about the person who minted the hashcash stamp.  However,
interestingly, it would be necessary for the remailers to anonymously
remail database updates because revealing the remailer which received
the hashcash token would allow the newnym reply blocks to be traced.
Disruptive remailers could remove all of the hashcash tokens as the
sender would be forced to send them all to be readable by the first
remailer, not knowing the identity of the rest of the remailers.  Not
a big problem I think because remailers which do this can be weeded
out statistically, and will suffer in the remailer ping league tables
for such behaviour.  They can already disrupt pretty well if inclined

of p in bits.  Method 2 has the advantage that key generation is faster as it is
quicker to generate new random numbers r, than to repeatedly generate
trial prime q as you have to do in method 1.  However is the security
weaker in method 2?  What size of p and q do you have to use to get
the same security as for same size of p in bits as in method 1?  What
should be the relationship between the size of p and q?
(this isn't cpunks, this is cpunks-flames, so your non-crypto pledge
shouldn't hold, besides Sandy has a stated policy of killing the whole
thread, so I thought it amusing to continue your crypto relevance in
moving on to technical topics rather than political)

My main complaints about the `filtering' service forced upon the list
readership are that:
1. It was done to the main list!  If cypherpunks were left unchanged,
and a `cypherpunks-edited' were created I wouldn't have a problem, it
would be just another filtered list.  However there are already
several filtered lists, so the usefulness of this is limited anyway.
Merely including details of these filtered lists in the sign on
message, and posting a reminder every few weeks would suffice.  I and
apparently, most others didn't choose to subscribe to a filtering
service.  I object to this choice being over-ridden.  OK, so I can
re-subscribe to cypherpunks (cypherpunks-unedited), but many won't
bother.  (Actually I subscribe to cypherpunks-flames and cypherpunks,
as the most efficient way of receiving all messages, and still being
able to see the moderation results).
2. The impetus for moderating the main list seems to be as a result of
a few posts by Dimitri.  Really, if this is all it takes to destroy an
unmoderated list, I've got to laugh at cypherpunks collectively.  Why
is it such a big deal to press the `n' key, if you don't like what
Dimitri, or anyone else, has to say?  If your time is too valuable to
press `n' keys, what is wrong with subscribing to the existing
filtered lists?  Or with setting up a kill-file?  Or maybe generating
a bit of signal yourself?
3. It is even more funny that in my opinion Dimitri purposefully set
out to raise the issue of censorship (after his own partial
censorship), and has succeeded to this extent.  The whole thing is
just allowing yourself to be manipulated by his transparent efforts.
4. There is already a moderated forum for discussion of cypherpunks
issues: cryptography at c2.net, why do we need another one?
My vote is for renaming:
and	`cypherpunks' -> `cypherpunks-edited'
and for moving all those still on the edited list to the unedited

@_subject: "alt.cypherpunks" people? 
John Gilmore urges action, or piping down... well lets start with
discussion of whether one possible action is appropriate, and useful
(piping down is not an option:-):
What do people think of starting an alt.cypherpunks USENET newsgroup?
It has some advantages:
 1. It distributes the cost of information dispersal, rather than
    largely placeing the load on a single machine.
 2. Newsreading software typically includes threading, which is useful
 3. It avoids the issue of ownership, it is more anarchic.  There is
    no list or host owner to get prosecuted for copyright violations,     export law violations, libel etc.
 4. Automatically gets archived several places, and is searchable
 5. It will be unmoderated
And some disadvantages...
 1. Cross-posting in USENET is a problem, especially in alt newsgroups
 2. Commercial spam is a problem with newsgroups
 3. USENET distribution is likely less efficient of overall bandwidth
 4. News propogation times are often poor (Exeter univ. receives news
    about a week late) This is a real killer in my view.  I have
    another news server I can access at the moment, but not everyone
    may have access to a reasonable news server.
 5. News access is more complex for some people.  Some alt newsgroups
    are not carried by some servers.  Perhaps news-to-mail and
    mail-to-news gateway would solve these problems.
 6. Some have argued in the past on this topic that the mailing list
    medium is better because it is more exclusive, as it requires more
    technical competence, and an active enough interest to subscribe.
    This is an elitist argument.  Perhaps it is relevant though, if we
    are trying to maintain a mailing list where technical discussions on
    how to improve privacy are to take place.  I wouldn't call this
    attitude censorship though.
My overall feeling is that I prefer the faster turn around time of a
mailing list.  When interesting things were/are happening on the list
(netscape break, late breaking crypto news, and cypherpunks spin on
it), the fast turn around time was essential.  Being able to react
quickly to news items, and to organise technical projects rapidly is
one of the cypherpunks main advantages and attractions from my point
of view.
My view of moderation is that it is a huge amount of work for the
moderator, that it is hypocritical philosophically (we promote
anarchy, but in order to effectively promote anarchy, we reject
anarchy), that it breeds artificial social hierarchys, rather than
allowing posts and posters reputations to stand on their own merit.
I was happier with the strength of the philsophical standing of the
list prior to moderation.  Moderation hasn't improved the noise much
Readers who have been reading for several years may understandably
wish to recapture the stimulating discourses, and lively community
feel to the list from the past.  Lists change, cypherpunks is a victim
of it's own success, media attention increased public awareness,
increased number of subscribers, and at the same time increased the
proportion of noisy off-topic posts.  Unfortunately the success of the
list, and the noise has resulted in some of those people who kept it
interesting leaving the list.
Coderpunks is a reasonable list, I'm not sure that it is moderated as
such, but if you breach etiquette (discussion of politics, even when
perpetrated by respected cryptographers, or by people discussing the
implications of breaking DES, rather than the strict coding questions)
they get Futplex-grams, which I find slightly annoying.
Cryptography at c2.net is again reasonable, and gained back some of the
original people who quit cypherpunks over the years due to noise.
Cryptography is moderated.  (Or is moderated when Perry thinks it
would benefit from moderation, so that may change).
Perhaps some of the lack of stimulating discussion is simply that the
ideas are no longer hot new ideas.  Most of the interesting technology
and it's implications have been discussed.
What's left is attempting to stop government restrictions and backdoors,
and deploying the many complex peices of software for which there exists
uses and demands.

The gist of your post seems to be saying that:
 - yes, the result it is not purely anarchic
 - the moderation experiment intentionally moderated the main list
   by design
 - this is perhaps slightly at odds with cypherpunks philosphy on
   freedom
but that this is necessary because:
 - cypherpunks larger goals are more important
 - cypherpunks goals are better served by having a lower noise
   environment to work in
 - create that environment by any means possible (ends justify the means)
 - people weren't being responsible with their freedom anyway
 - it's only an experiment
 - if you don't like this and complain you're part of the problem
Now it may seem nit-picking to a pragmatist, which is the way you
presented your arguments, but the idea that cypherpunks should stoop
to moderation/censorship calls into question what cypherpunks larger
goals are.  Why?  Because we promote electronic freedom, but in order
to effectively organise the promotion of freedom, we reject full
freedom of speech as unworkable, and impose restrictions.  This lends
ammunition to our opponents.  "See even they realise there must be
limits to free speech".
Cypherpunks main goal is:
  "to promote privacy and freedom through technological means"
and arising from this goal, are presumed philosphical stances:
 - privacy and freedom are a good thing (unconditional free speech is
   a good thing)
 - censorship is a bad thing
 - government retrictions and backdoors in crypto are a bad thing
   (crypto providing practical privacy, and practical free speech
   being provided by cryptographically enabled anonymity)
 - chaumian credentials are preferable to fully traceable credentials
 - etc. etc.
So the question to me boils down to is unconditional free speech a
good thing?
Dorothy Denning says no.  Louis Freeh says no.  The Clinton
administration says no.
I thought you said yes.  I thought most of your actions for the last
10 years screamed yes!
Why cut corners for little gain?
Another moderated list with official sanction (hosted by toad.com,
with your commendation that people subscribe to it (to reduce noise
and increase productivity), with instructions in the sign on message
listing the moderated/filtered lists available, clearly stating the
filtering policy, regularly posted instructions on available filtered
lists to cypherpunks) would have been beautiful.  Fine.  Lovely.
But you set up moderation of _the_ list, with no interaction required
by the subscriber.
That caused Tim to unsubscribe.  It's causing me, and others to argue
for this aspect of the moderation to be reversed ASAP.
Education, and countering government news-speak seems to be the key
issues at the moment.
Educate the journalist that perpetuated the pro-GAK lie.  Write an
article to the same publication pointing out the fallacy
(unfortunately as these are private presses they are `moderated', so
you may not get your say).  Buy the advert space if they won't
publish.  I'll contribute.
Distribute strong crypto (you are personally, the ipsec S/WAN
initiative is important).  I'm working on creating and distributing
strong crypto, and influencing sectors of users to use strong crypto,
rather than export crippled US stuff.  The myth that 56 bits is strong
is perpetuated by journalists outside the US too.  The export
situation is complex, many user groups (even IT managers) don't
understand.  They don't understand the meaning of key strengths
either.  Break DES to demonstrate it's weakness.  May happen in the next 1/2
year.  Gets free publicity.  People aren't saying 40 bits are secure
anymore.  Cypherpunks acheived that.
Hope that Matt Blaze goes ahead with his hardware DES breaker.  He
said some time ago that he had spare funding and was considering using
it for this purpose.  Anyone know the state of play?  This would be
more important as it would quantify the costs, and would be much more
impressive, and realistic for an estimate of the strength of DES
against industrial espionage or well funded criminal attack.

 - this is perhaps slightly at odds with cypherpunks philosphy on
   freedom
but that this is necessary because:
 - cypherpunks larger goals are more important
 - cypherpunks goals are better served by having a lower noise
   environment to work in
 - create that environment by any means possible (ends justify the means)
 - people weren't being responsible with their freedom anyway
 - it's only an experiment
 - if you don't like this and complain you're part of the problem
Now it may seem nit-picking to a pragmatist, which is the way you
presented your arguments, but the idea that cypherpunks should stoop
to moderation/censorship calls into question what cypherpunks larger
goals are.  Why?  Because we promote electronic freedom, but in order
to effectively organise the promotion of freedom, we reject full
freedom of speech as unworkable, and impose restrictions.  This lends
ammunition to our opponents.  "See even they realise there must be
limits to free speech".
Cypherpunks main goal is:
  "to promote privacy and freedom through technological means"
and arising from this goal, are presumed philosphical stances:
 - privacy and freedom are a good thing (unconditional free speech is
   a good thing)
 - censorship is a bad thing
 - government retrictions and backdoors in crypto are a bad thing
   (crypto providing practical privacy, and practical free speech
   being provided by cryptographically enabled anonymity)
 - chaumian credentials are preferable to fully traceable credentials
 - etc. etc.
So the question to me boils down to is unconditional free speech a
good thing?
Dorothy Denning says no.  Louis Freeh says no.  The Clinton
administration says no.
I thought you said yes.  I thought most of your actions for the last
10 years screamed yes!
Why cut corners for little gain?
Another moderated list with official sanction (hosted by toad.com,
with your commendation that people subscribe to it (to reduce noise
and increase productivity), with instructions in the sign on message
listing the moderated/filtered lists available, clearly stating the
filtering policy, regularly posted instructions on available filtered
lists to cypherpunks) would have been beautiful.  Fine.  Lovely.
But you set up moderation of _the_ list, with no interaction required
by the subscriber.
That caused Tim to unsubscribe.  It's causing me, and others to argue
for this aspect of the moderation to be reversed ASAP.
Education, and countering government news-speak seems to be the key
issues at the moment.
Educate the journalist that perpetuated the pro-GAK lie.  Write an
article to the same publication pointing out the fallacy
(unfortunately as these are private presses they are `moderated', so
you may not get your say).  Buy the advert space if they won't
publish.  I'll contribute.
Distribute strong crypto (you are personally, the ipsec S/WAN
initiative is important).  I'm working on creating and distributing
strong crypto, and influencing sectors of users to use strong crypto,
rather than export crippled US stuff.  The myth that 56 bits is strong
is perpetuated by journalists outside the US too.  The export
situation is complex, many user groups (even IT managers) don't
understand.  They don't understand the meaning of key strengths
either.  Break DES to demonstrate it's weakness.  May happen in the next 1/2
year.  Gets free publicity.  People aren't saying 40 bits are secure
anymore.  Cypherpunks acheived that.
Hope that Matt Blaze goes ahead with his hardware DES breaker.  He
said some time ago that he had spare funding and was considering using
it for this purpose.  Anyone know the state of play?  This would be
more important as it would quantify the costs, and would be much more
impressive, and realistic for an estimate of the strength of DES
against industrial espionage or well funded criminal attack.

@_subject: "alt.cypherpunks" people? 
John Gilmore urges action, or piping down... well lets start with
discussion of whether one possible action is appropriate, and useful
(piping down is not an option:-):
What do people think of starting an alt.cypherpunks USENET newsgroup?
It has some advantages:
 1. It distributes the cost of information dispersal, rather than
    largely placeing the load on a single machine.
 2. Newsreading software typically includes threading, which is useful
 3. It avoids the issue of ownership, it is more anarchic.  There is
    no list or host owner to get prosecuted for copyright violations,     export law violations, libel etc.
 4. Automatically gets archived several places, and is searchable
 5. It will be unmoderated
And some disadvantages...
 1. Cross-posting in USENET is a problem, especially in alt newsgroups
 2. Commercial spam is a problem with newsgroups
 3. USENET distribution is likely less efficient of overall bandwidth
 4. News propogation times are often poor (Exeter univ. receives news
    about a week late) This is a real killer in my view.  I have
    another news server I can access at the moment, but not everyone
    may have access to a reasonable news server.
 5. News access is more complex for some people.  Some alt newsgroups
    are not carried by some servers.  Perhaps news-to-mail and
    mail-to-news gateway would solve these problems.
 6. Some have argued in the past on this topic that the mailing list
    medium is better because it is more exclusive, as it requires more
    technical competence, and an active enough interest to subscribe.
    This is an elitist argument.  Perhaps it is relevant though, if we
    are trying to maintain a mailing list where technical discussions on
    how to improve privacy are to take place.  I wouldn't call this
    attitude censorship though.
My overall feeling is that I prefer the faster turn around time of a
mailing list.  When interesting things were/are happening on the list
(netscape break, late breaking crypto news, and cypherpunks spin on
it), the fast turn around time was essential.  Being able to react
quickly to news items, and to organise technical projects rapidly is
one of the cypherpunks main advantages and attractions from my point
of view.
My view of moderation is that it is a huge amount of work for the
moderator, that it is hypocritical philosophically (we promote
anarchy, but in order to effectively promote anarchy, we reject
anarchy), that it breeds artificial social hierarchys, rather than
allowing posts and posters reputations to stand on their own merit.
I was happier with the strength of the philsophical standing of the
list prior to moderation.  Moderation hasn't improved the noise much
Readers who have been reading for several years may understandably
wish to recapture the stimulating discourses, and lively community
feel to the list from the past.  Lists change, cypherpunks is a victim
of it's own success, media attention increased public awareness,
increased number of subscribers, and at the same time increased the
proportion of noisy off-topic posts.  Unfortunately the success of the
list, and the noise has resulted in some of those people who kept it
interesting leaving the list.
Coderpunks is a reasonable list, I'm not sure that it is moderated as
such, but if you breach etiquette (discussion of politics, even when
perpetrated by respected cryptographers, or by people discussing the
implications of breaking DES, rather than the strict coding questions)
they get Futplex-grams, which I find slightly annoying.
Cryptography at c2.net is again reasonable, and gained back some of the
original people who quit cypherpunks over the years due to noise.
Cryptography is moderated.  (Or is moderated when Perry thinks it
would benefit from moderation, so that may change).
Perhaps some of the lack of stimulating discussion is simply that the
ideas are no longer hot new ideas.  Most of the interesting technology
and it's implications have been discussed.
What's left is attempting to stop government restrictions and backdoors,
and deploying the many complex peices of software for which there exists
uses and demands.

What aspect of Skipjack family is Elliptic curve?
Skipjack itself I thought was a symmetric key block cipher, with 80
bit keys and 64 bit block size.
The key escrow designs (clipper chip and family) included several
1. check sum to prevent LEAF (Law Enforcement Access Field) forgery
   (16 bits, which is not enough as Matt Blaze demonstrated)
2. government access copy of chip's serial number encrypted with LE
   family key in LEAF 3. copy of session key encrypted with unit's escrow key in LEAF (the
   escrow key is the key that is stored in the government database
   indexed by chip serial number - the database which is split between
   the two escrow agents).
4. hardware random number key generation
5. undisclosed key exchange mechanism
6. are DSS signatures used?
Presumably the Elliptic curve is for key exchange?  Is there something
about the design which implies Ellitpic curve must be the key exchange
mechanism used?
Another possible area for public key, if they had it on chip, would be
to use public key encryption for the encryption of the serial number.
Otherwise, when the chip is reverse engineered the LE family key would
allow traffic analysis of all clipper traffic.  Public key would
prevent this.
(According to Ross Anderson's paper on tamper proof hardware, at least
one chip manufacturer has reverse engineered the clipper chip)
It is true that sci.crypt and coderpunks do make alternative fora.

@_subject: NEW CYPHERPUNKS LIST (was Re: Moderation experiment almost over; "put up or shut up") 
I wish people would give subject fields which stand out to posts of
significant interest, other wise they tend to get lost in the noise.
(I have corrected this :-)
First, thanks for your efforts!  (I had just spent a couple of hours
putting together a web page, and collecting information to organise
something, but you beat me to it.)  As I have spent some time on it,
I'll contribute what I had planned:
As a stop gap measure you could create a standard majordomo at the
beefiest of your 'domo hosts.
Or you could create a quick 'n dirty mail exploder, by taking the
current subscribers, and putting 100 mail addresses in a .forward file
at each , and having the central 'domo with
an initial subscription list all the mail-exploders, plus all those
who subscribe afterwards.
Buys use some time to get to iron out the wrinkles in the distributed
list scheme.
As a simpler alternative to the mutually subscribed majordomo's you
might consider using mail-exploders for the final solution: set up
mail exploders which soley forward posts to subscribers (ie do not
accept posts).  The mail-exploder would be an appropriately
configured/modified majordomo itself.  Have a central majordomo which
accepts incoming posts, and forwards them to the mail-exploders.  The
central 'domo would also forward subscribe/unsubscribe to a random/the
correct(or all) majordomos.
Final comment: perhaps you've investigated this, but what Perry
Metzger has for the majordomo running cryptography at c2.net is excellent
at stopping people forging subscribe and unsubscribe messages.
The output looks like this:
: To: A.Back at exeter.ac.uk
: From: Majordomo at c2.net
: Subject: Confirmation for subscribe cryptography
: : Someone (possibly you) has requested that your email address be added
: to or deleted from the mailing list "cryptography at c2.net".
: : If you really want this action to be taken, please send the following
: commands (exactly as shown) back to "Majordomo at c2.net":
: :         auth abcd1234 subscribe cryptography A.Back at exeter.ac.uk
: : If you do not want to this action taken, just ignore this message and
: no action will be taken.
And would really cut down the nuisance of people subscribing others
without their knowledge.
Once, again thanks muchly for your's and Jim Ravage's efforts,

Sounds good enough to me.
I get the impression that Greg Broiles is, and he posted a message
proposing the creation of alt.cypherpunks a few hours before yours.
Perhaps you had not seen it.  Anyway he didn't propose a charter.
As Sten Drescher  and Jim Choate
 just announced their work on a distributed
list based on multiple majordomo hosts, the question remains as to
which of:
1. separate alt.cypherpunks and cypherpunks list 2. alt.cypherpunks and cypherpunks list gated both ways
3. cypherpunks list only
are most useful.
Either option 1 or option 2 sound good to me.  If the gating takes
place at a site with a good news feed, this would provide a mechanism
to allow people to access the list either way they chose.  (An
implementation of the news-mail / mail-news you proposed).

@_subject: distributed mailing list architecture 
I'm not sure what the architecture you are suggesting is, but this is
what I suggest as the simplest to set up.
Have one main majordomo.
Have many mail-exploders.
You subscribe to the main majordomo request address, and it forwards
your subscription request to a random mail-exploder.
You unsubscribe to the main majordomo request address, and it forwards
your subscription to all the mail-exploders request addresses
(unsubscribe traffic is low anyway, keeping track of who is subscribed
where at the main major domo doesn't seem worth it).
Each person who wishes to run an exploder is subscribed (manually) to
the main majordomo.
You submit articles to the main majordomo, and it sends copies of the
articles to it's subscribers (the mail-exploders).
The mail-exploders send mail to the address on their subscriber lists.
(John Gilmore suggested this architecture, as a simpler alternative).

I'd like to see them.  In fact I'd like to collect the posts which slipped
through the crack and didn't make it to either cp-flames or cp, on the
assumption that these are the posts which tell the story.
In particular I'd like to see the post that John Gilmore refered to as `Mr
Nemesis' post, wherein someone allegedly slanders/libels C2, to the
extent that Sandy dropped it from both lists, if anyone who was
subscribed to cypherpunks-unedited at the time has it still.
Unfortunately I was subscribed to only cypherpuks-flames and
cypherpunks (the edited list) at the time, so didn't get to see it.
I'm on Lance Cottrell's cypherpunks at cyberpass.net now, which is
subscribed to the cypherpunks-unedited list.  At the moment Lance is
setting Reply-To: to cypherpunks at toad.com, but I presume he'll drop
that when John Gilmore drops cypherpunks at toad.com.
The moderation decisions that I saw prior to moving to
cypherpunks-unedited after Sandy's return, and change of policy, were
even more arbitrary.  I figured I wasn't even interested to see what
they were any more, given that the cypherpunks at toad.com was shortly
being closed anyway, so just subscribed to cypherpunks-unedited.

@_subject: (fwd) DES challenge organisation 
An announcement forwarded to me (due to being on des-challenge mailing
list I think) of proposed organisation for breaking RSADSI's DES
Those interested in participating might wish to join the lists
In addition the list: des-challenge at muffin.org is for discussion of
the DES challenge, and can be subscribed to by sending email to
majordomo at muffin.org.
The six volunteers who answered the call for a committee of
management have got together to try to help 'steer' the DES challenge.
We have considered the available options of proceeding, and we kindly
ask everyone interested in this project to follow our proposals, to
avoid waste of efforts.
1. The attempt to break the key will be coordinated. We chose this
   mainly because we can make a political statement. We don't want it
   to be a race for money.
   Each task will be handled by logically separate servers, some of
   which with be replicated and run as a hierachy. The protocol will
   use UDP, although there will be gateway servers for other protocols
   (such as HTTP, SMTP, FAX, etc). We hope that one of the first
   requests for a key range will be from parties interested in using a
   "random" approach -- we would appreciate some discussion on how
   large their ranges should be.
2. There will be one consistent WWW structure for the project. It does
   not have to managed by a single person. This structure should
   provide statistics, information for developers, interested users
   and perhaps even for the press. Several mirrors and translations
   will be started soon. The starting point is:
   The url in brackets has to be used till we get the final subdomain.
   Likewise for the rest of this document.
3. The work of the different groups should be stated and coordinated
   on the page    [fh28.fa.umist.ac.uk/des/people.html] This is to avoid uncoordinated
   parallel developmemt. Please write to Thomas S.     [webmaster at fh28.fa.umist.ac.uk]    if you what want to be mentioned on this page. 3a. Several mailing lists have been set up for the different groups: des-coding	for the actual DES routine and optimisation
des-networking	for the network code and protocol
des-www		for www contributions and mirrors
des-pr		for press contact, translations etc (like challenge-pr)
des-misc	:-)
des-announce	moderated, important information for users of the client
List address:  [ To subscribe, send mail to majordomo at lists.des.crypto.org [ with in the body of the message (several actions allowed):    subscribe  Achives available (see homepage).
4. The actual DES routine has to be written and optimised. We ask
   developers to participate and coordinate their efforts using the
   mailing list des-coding. For obvious reasons, developers outside
   the USA are prefered, but "publication" of algorithms seems to be
   a legal way go get around. Please do not use this list to    distribute crypto code.
5. The prize money will be split equally between Gutenberg and EFF.
   There is a possibility of using part of it for stickers or
   something similar, but don't count on it.
We hope to get a working system up and running ASAP. The fact alone
that DES is seriously challenged (with a reasonable time frame) should
give us quite some publicity (by the time the system is ready). If we
can make use of that, we will have significantly more client than for
the 48 bit key.

@_subject: (fwd) DES challenge organisation 
Not a good idea.
How can this be enforced?  The RSADSI DES challenge is open to all
comers, and how do you prove that someone who finds the key found it
through this group effort?
I have a suspicion many people would be tempted to fill in the RSA
challenge form and email it in themselves.  $10,000 is a fair amount
of money.
I know I would be tempted.  I have been running Svend Olaf's DES code,
and my intention in the unlikely event that I hit the key had been to
claim the money.
How does it hurt the publicity if the actual individual who finds the
key takes the money?  Surely it adds excitement to the story?
In fact it would provide people with a possibly more powerful
incentive to try to break the key in the first place -- in the hopes
of winning the prize!  $10,000 means more to a lot of people than
opposing ITAR/EAR, and participating in a technical challenge.  To
start with a lot of people who's CPUs we could be using don't even
know what ITAR/EAR are!
I would have thought announcing that $10,000 can be won by running
easy to use windows software on a wide selection of newsgroups would
get you lots of CPUs!

@_subject: Moderation experiment and moderator liability 
There appears to be a bit of a hush up surrounding the circumstances
of the pause in the moderation experiment and subsequent change of
moderation policy.
To clear the air, I think it would be kind of nice if the full story
were told, so I'll gather here a history as I understand it.
Information from my archives (those I have), and from asking around in
I realise that some of the actions that I am claiming of participants
in this sequence of events seem hard to believe given their high
reputation capital.  I was myself initially dubious on the strength of
the reputation capital of those being critisized.
However the below is the sequence of events as close as I can
I welcome being proven wrong on any points.
1. Dimitri Vulis posted a lot of off topic posts over a period of time
2. Dimitri reposted a couple of 50k Serdar Argic revisionist articles 3. Dimitri challenged John Gilmore to shut him up
4. John unsubscribed Dimitri, and modified majordomo at toad.com to
siltently ignore Dimitri's attempts to resubscribe.  Dimitri could
still post, and presumably read cypherpunks with a different email
address or via an archive.  It was a token unsubscription only.
5. When Dimitri figured out what John had done, he made many posts
denigrating John as a censor
6. Much discussion ensued critisizing John for blocking Dimitri
7. Over Christmas some joker subscribed cypherpunks at toad.com to a load
of sports mailing lists, Hugh Daniels and John cleaned up the mess
8. Followed a long thread on hardening lists against spam attacks
9. John made a post to the list announcing that the list would be
moderated for one month from Jan 11 as an experiment, and included
Sandy Sandfort's proposed moderatation policy and offer to act as
moderator.  It appeared that the moderation experiment was Sandy's
suggestion, and that John had agreed to go along with it.
10. Some discussion both pro and con of moderation, and the technical
, free speech, and legal aspects followed
11. Moderation started Jan 19, the main list became the moderated list
12. Lots of people complained about the moderation, some defended it
Tim May quietly unsubscribed
13. Some people complained about inconsistency in moderation -- some
articles which went to flames were not flamish, but made by posters
with low reputation capital, or were following up to posts which were
14. After a while some people commented on Tim's absence, and sent him
mail asking what happened.  Tim posted an article explaining that he
had left because of the imposed moderation without discussion.
15. John followed up with a post defending the moderation experiment,
and arguing for it's popularity (he claimed as evidence the number of
posters who had not taken the trouble to move to the unedited list).
16. Dimitri posted an article where he claimed that there was a
security flaw in Stronghold.  Stronghold is C2Nets commercial version
of the freeware Apache SSL web server.  Sandy is employed by C2Net.
17. Sandy dropped the posting entirely -- it went to neither
cypherpunks (edited), nor cypherpunks-flames.  He considered that
forwarding the posting would have made him legally liable.  Sandy is a
lawyer by profession.  He did not explain this situation on the list.
18. Tim May had by now subscribed to cypherpunks-flames, and posted
several follow-ups to Dimitri's posting, discussing the issue of
Dimitri's post being dropped, and stated that Dimitri's posting was
not flamish, and should not have been dropped in his opinion.  Tim's
postings were also silently dropped, going to neither of cypherpunks
(edited), and cypherpunks-flames.
19. Sandy made an announcement that he was ending his participation in
the moderation experiment.  Still no explanation of why posts were
dropped, or even admission that they were.
20. The two moderated cypherpunks lists (cypherpunks and
cypherpunks-flames) went dead for some time.
21. Tim received a warning from C2Net's lawyers that if he did not
desist from mentioning that Dimitri had posted an article criticising
a C2Net product that he would be sued!
22. John posted a statement where he explained Sandy's sudden
announcement of ending his particpation.  John explained that Sandy
had "hit a pothole in the moderation experiment when Mr. Nemesis
submitted a posting containing nothing but libelous statements about
Sandy's employer".  Sandy did not drop Johns posting even though it
covered the same topics that had resulted in Tim's posts being
dropped, and resulted in Tim receiving legal threats from C2Net.  In
the same post John said that he had come to the conclusion that he was
no longer willing to host the cypherpunks list.  In this post John
announced that Sandy had been persuaded to continue to moderate for
the remainder of the moderation period, and gave the new policy.  The
changes were that anything other than crypto discussion and discussion
of forming a new cypherpunks list would go to flames, and anything
that Sandy thought was libelous would be dropped silently.
23. Sandy posted a statement affirming that he would continue to
moderate, and that if any cypherpunks wished to discuss his prior
moderation policy and performance as a moderator that they do it on
new lists which they create themselves.
(If Sandy's current moderation criteria mean that he feels obliged to
forward this post to cypherpunks-flames as off-topic, or even to
silently drop it from both moderated lists, so be it.  I will simply
repost it later, when the moderation experiment is over on one of the
new lists.  In the event of myself receiving legal threats, I shall
simply post it via a remailer, or rely on someone else to do so.  C2
does not appear to be running any remailers at the moment, otherwise I
would use a remailer hosted at c2.net as the exit node in the remailer
The positive outcome of all this has been to make the cypherpunks list
more resilient to legal attack.  The new distributed list seems to be
progressing well, and will be less liable to attack.  Filtering
services continue, as they should.  And alt.cypherpunks has been
created as a forum ultimately resistant to legal attack.
Also I should say that I would hope that no one holds any long term
animosity towards any of the players in this episode, many of the
people have been very prolific in their work to further online privacy
and freedom, and I hope that we can all put this chapter behind us.
Now more fun things...
Anyone checked out the DES breaking project?
Over on are details of mailing lists where people are organising breaking
RSADSIs DES challenge.  For the RC5/32/12/6 (48 bit RC5) break which
took 13 days, it seems there were a peak of 5000 machines involved.
At this rate it will take 8 months to break DES.

Anyone checked out the DES breaking project?
Over on are details of mailing lists where people are organising breaking
RSADSIs DES challenge.  For the RC5/32/12/6 (48 bit RC5) break which
took 13 days, it seems there were a peak of 5000 machines involved.
At this rate it will take 8 months to break DES.

My archive is patchy at the time, as I subscribed to cp and cp-flames,
and only switched to cp-unedited when it became apparent that I would
be missing some posts by not being on cp-unedited.
However, these are the posts that I have obtained from list members,
the posts from Tim were forwarded to me by Tim himself (on request --
he offered in a post to do so), Dimitri's post was forwarded to me by
Peter Hendrickson and confirmed by Toto, and Igor.  Tim declined to
confirm or deny when I forwarded him Dimitri's post due to the legal
threats.  I do think that this is Dimitri's original post.  You will
observe that the post it isn't flamish.
There are many, many other posts which go to confirm the list of

Whether true or not, it is not the role of Sandy the Censor to decide on
the truth of various claims in people's posts. Even by his own (vague and
changing) standards, deciding on the _truthfulness_ of articles was never
a criterion.
This is a serious charge. Can you send to the list, with a copy to me, the
articles which cited security holes in Stronghold?
Given that Sandy works for a company, Community Connection/C2NET, which
_sells_ Stronghold, it would be serious indeed if Sandy is using his role
as List.Censor to keep such articles from the main list, and even more
serious (much more serious), if Sandy is discarding such articles
Given the extremely serious implications of this charge, I would like to
see some evidence before believing it.
By the way, this again raises the issue of the danger of filtering out
posts merely because _somewhere_ in the post insulting words are used.
(Recall that my long essay was almost scrapped by Sandy, by his own
admission, because one small paragraph said unflattering things about some
people. Jeesh. Is this what Cypherpunks has become?)
It would be far better, and more honest (in a warped way), if Sandy were
to leave in the substantive sections of all posts and merely mark
offending sections as "***** C E N S O R E D *****." Then people could
read the various claims made in posts and still have the "naughty bits"
blacked out, so as not to offend their sensibilities. It's the honest way
to censor.
--Tim May
Vulis has sent me private mail, which I won't quote here because of the
usual netiquette standards that private mail not be quoted (though it's
legal to do so). He asserts that a few weeks ago he sent criticisms of
Stronghold out to the Cypherpunks list, and the criticisms did not appear
on any of the distributed lists.
He claims he then received communications from C2Net of a legal nature,
threatening him with legal action. I'll let Vulis elaborate if he wishes,
as I don't know the situation. And I encourage him to do so, for more than
one reason.
As I just replied to "Against Moderation" on, I would like to see these
articles which were suppressed. Please repost them to the list, and copy
me to ensure that I get them.
If this claim is true, that Sandy blocked criticism of Stronghold from
reaching either the Main list (bad enough), or from even going out at all
on the Flames list (reprehensible), then this is an extremely serious
If the claim is true that Sandy used articles sent to the Cypherpunks
list, but never distributed to the list, as the basis by the company which
employs him of legal threats of any kind, then this is even more than just
"extremely serious."
I would like to hear more from Vulis, and copies of any such articles, and
of course would like to hear Sandy's version of things.
This is too serious a charge not to resolve.

"main" (censored) list, and do not see it there, either by title or by
I only recently subscribed to the Flames list, so I cannot check to see if
it went there. Anyone else check the Flames list?
As I said in my last messages, if this message went to neither the Main
list nor the Flames list, then a very serious problem has been exposed.
Further, if the post, while not being sent to either of the nominal lists
which filtered stuff is supposed to go to, was used as the basis of legal
threats by the employer of Sandy, the list's censor, then dramatically
more serious implications seem evident. I await Sandy's views with great
The message itself does not look flamish to me. It makes charges, but so
do a zillion other posts. It cannot be the job of a censor to decide on
what is true and what is not true.
It's not "flamey." Nobody is called a cocksucker, nobody is called  a
faggot, etc. Yes, it claims a product has a trojan horse, but this is a
claim comparable to other claims routinely made on list and newsgroups.
I'm also neither stupid nor disingenuous. I realize full well that Vulis
probably made the claim because he knows Sandy works for the seller of
Stronghold. Be that as it may, it is not proper for a censor employed by
the seller of a product to decide that criticisms of his product are
flamish. Would the list have countenanced censorship of criticisms of an
RSADSI product if the list were being censored by an employee of RSADSI?
And by letting Vulis make such a claim, and then having it quickly
rebutted by other employees of C2Net, for example, Vulis would be shown to
be spreading disinformation and his reputation capital would decline still
If in fact the Vulis claim never made it either of the two lists to which
all filtered messages are supposed to be sorted, then deception has
occurred. And a conflict of interest.
Again, I await Sandy's response.

(long account of getting legal threats for quoting a message about
CENSORED elided)
This is indeed an important incident. I hope we can discuss it. Many
issues central to Cypherpunks are involved. To name a few:
* the moderation/censorship issue itself (though we have probably beaten
this one to death in the last few weeks).
* the "libel" issue, especially as it involves Sandy, his company, and the
machine the list is hosted from. The introduction of a censor has, as many
of us predicted, raised serious libel and liability issues. (This is the
best reason I can think of it to move to an "alt.cypherpunks" system,
where bypassing of liability, libel, copyright violation, etc.,  laws is
naturally handled by the globally decentralized and uncontrolled nature of
* conflicts of interest issues. Apparently Sandy feels information
deleterious to C2Net, having to do with a claimed CENSORED in the software
product CENSORED, cannot be passed by him to _either_ of the two lists to
which articles are supposed to be sent. (Sadly, he did not tell us of this
meta-censorship when it happened. This made what he did deceptive as well
as wrong.)
* chilling of discussion. As "Against Moderation" notes, merely _quoting_
the article of another caused Sandy to not only reject his article, but
also to contact him and raise the threat of legal action. (This even
though Against Moderation added all sorts of "obviously false" comments to
what Vulis had written.)
* even more threats. At the request of CENSORED today, I called CENSORED
and had a verbal communication with him (a nice guy, by the way) about
this situation. He averred that "you don't want to be pulled into this,"
and suggested that if I post certain things, even quoting the reports that
a CENSORED exists in CENSORED, I could well be sued by the lawyers of his
These are issues which remailers, decentralized servers, anonymity, data
havens, and other Cypherpunks technologies make important issues for us to
When did Cypherpunks start thinking about libel? (Obvious answer: when
_their_ companies were the targets of criticism, lies, libel, whatever.)
It's not as if insulting or even "libelous" (I'm not a lawyer) comments
have not been made routinely on the list. Insulting companies and other
institutions has been standard Cypherpunks fare since the beginning.
Mykotronx has been accused of high crimes, RSADSI has been declared to be
placing backdoors in code, Phil Zimmermann has been declared to be an NSA
plant ("only trust the versions of PGP before he cut the deal to get his
freedom"), and so on. Think about it. Just about any company with any
product related to crypto has at one time or another had their motives
questioned, their products slammed, etc.
Unfortunately, our Late Censor is an employee of one of the companies so
slammed, and he has reacted by rejecting one or more of these slams
without bothering to tell the list that he has to do so. (Were it me, I
would have "recused" myself from the decision, or at least told the list
in general terms what was going on, or, more likely, resigned as censor.
But then I would never have been a list.censor in the first place.)
I understand that Sandy is stepping down as our Moderator. The Censor is
Dead, Long Live Sandy! I expect to harbor no continuing resentment toward
Sandy (though I expect things will be strained for a while, as might be
The issues raised are ugly ones. Here's what scares me: the "precedent"
may irretrievably be established that companies offended by words on the
list will threaten legal action to recover their good name. I can imagine
Mykotronx or even First Virtual citing the actions of C2Net as a precedent
(a cultural precedent, to the extent there is such a thing) for their own
legal letters.
As with the terrible precedent set by the "even Cypherpunks had to censor
themselves" experiment, these companies may be able to say "But even a
Cypherpunk-oriented company realized that the antidote for damaging speech
was not rebutting speech. No, these Cypherpunks realized that some
threatening letters and pulling the plug on the speaker was a better
And we won't be able to easily argue that Mykotronx has no right to do
this while C2Net does.
Sandy, in his message a few hours ago to Against Moderation, even made the
claim (and Sandy _is_ a lawyer, or at least once was) that John Gilmore
could be held liable for speech on the Cypherpunks list. (I don't doubt
the "could," but I hate like hell to see a Cypherpunkish company leading
the charge.)
Perhaps this is true. But the Censorship experiment, and the resulting
threats of legal action by C2Net to stop mention of the alleged CENSORED
in their product CENSORED, fuel the fire. Instead of denigrating such
legal moves--as I'm sure most Cypherpunks would have done a few years ago
if RSADSI were to try to sue people for making outrageous claims--we have
a major company consisting of several leading Cypherpunks making just such
I'm not a legal scholar, but is it really the case that merely _alluding_
to the allegedly libelous comments of another is itself a libel? Is a
reporter who writes that "Person X has alleged that Product Y has a Flaw
Z" thus committing a libel? (I don't think so, as reporters frequently
report such things. If merely quoting an alleged libel is also libel, then
presumably a lot of reporters, and even court clerks reporting on cases,
are libelers.)
(ObLisp reference: quoting an expression ought to have a different return
value than evaluating an expression! That's what quotes are for.)
My comments this past week have not been motivated by animosity toward
Sandy, and certainly my comments today are not motivated by any animosity
about C2Net or any of its employees (including CENSORED, whom I spoke with
My comments started out as being a summary of why I had left Cypherpunks
when the Great Hijacking was announced. Since last Sunday, when I issued
my "Moderation" post, I've only responded to messages I was CC:ed on, or
to messages on the Flames list, which I subscribed to temporarily to
better see what Sandy was calling flames. The discovery that certain posts
were not appearing on either the Main list or the Flames list triggered
today's comments about Sandy and the alleged CENSOREDCENSOREDCENSORED
(blah blah blah).
I hope we can declare this Censorship experiment a failure and move on.
However,  it is almost certain that as a result of attempts to suppress
certain views, that the move back to an unfiltered state will mean that
some will use anonymous remailers and nym servers to post even _more_
claims, however outrageous.
This is a predictable effect. Cf. Psychology 101 for an explanation.
Kicking Vulis off the list predictably produced a flood of Vulis
workarounds, and a surge in insults via anonymous remailers. Instituting
censorship of the list triggered a flood of comments critical of the
experiment, and a predictable "testing" of the censorship limits. And,
finally, now that C2Net is threatening legal action to stop
discussion--even in quotes!!--of alleged CENSORED in CENSORED, expect a
lot of repetition of these claims via remailers. And, I predict, claims
about CENSORED will even be spread more widely, e.g., on the Usenet.
(Sadly, I half expect a letter from some lawyers or lawyer larvae saying I
am "suborning libel," or somesuch nonsense. As Sandy would say, "piffle."
Lawyers, take your best shot.)
(A copy of this message has also been posted to the following newsgroups:
alt.cypherpunks,  alt.privacy, comp.org.eff.talk)
The only phone conversation I had was with Doug Barnes, at the request of
Doug that I urgently phone either him or Sameer. I called Doug as soon as I
got the message. (Doug also said he was the only one in the room at the
time, and that the call was *not* being recorded, so I have to surmise that
Sandy got his version of things via a recap by Doug.)
What Doug told me was that Dimitri Vulis had already been served with a
legal notice about his warnings about a security flaw in Stronghold, and
that any repetition of Dimitri's claims by me or anyone else would result
in similar legal action.
Doug said that any repetition of the claims, even as part of a quote, would
be seen as actionable by C2Net. "We'll vigorously defend our rights." (as
best I can recall) He said he thought my messages, to the extent they
merely _alluded_ to the claims were probably OK and that they would
certainly go through to the list, as Sandy has already resigned from his
role as moderator.
(For the record, these messages DID NOT GO THROUGH, and have not gone
through as of tonight, 8-9 days later. However, I have forwarded them to
several people who requested them.)
(I also did not have a recorder running, so I can't claim this is a
verbatim summary of what was said. As to what I said about how the
moderation thing might have been done differently, Doug and I chatted for a
while about various alternatives. I raised the point I've made before, that
having a "members only" policy, with some special provision for some amount
of remailed messages, would probably best suit the notion of keeping the
"community" running. What I told Doug was that my main objection was having
Sandy sit in judgement to essays folks might have spent a long time
composing, and I cited physical parties, where a host invites those he
wants in attendance, but does not micromanage or screen conversations being
held at the party. My sense was that Doug agreed, and agreed that the whole
thing had been handled in a bad way...but Doug should comment to tell his
view of things.)
The next day, at the physical Cyperpunks meeting at Stanford, I briefly
talked to Greg Broiles, working as a legal aide at C2Net. I told Greg he
could "take his best shot," in terms of filing suit against me about my
messages, as I'm prepared to fight C2Net in court on this matter, and have
the financial resources to hire some pretty good lawyers. (I don't recall
if Greg replied, or what his reply was.)
In a message to Cypherpunks, I outlined my understanding of the Vulis
report on security flaws in Stronghold, and put the claims  in the context
of messages not appearing on either of the two main lists,  but none of my
messages were sent to either the Main list or the Flames list. (I also had communication with several members of the list, some known to
me and some only pseudonyms. I have taken the precaution of erasing these
messages and copying files to the disk on which they resided to head off
any attempts by C2Net seize my computer and disks as part of some
"discovery" process.)
I find it unfortunate that C2Net is behaving in such a manner, and their
actions are generating far more publicity about the claimed security flaws
in Stronghold than the original Vulis message ever would have generated. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, as a Supreme Court justice averred. And
suppression is a breeding ground for all sorts of bacteria, fungi, and ugly
growth, as a less articulate person said.
Reporters interested in this story have already contacted me. They're
interested in the situation surrounding the claims of a flaw. I told one
reporter I had no expertise in Stronghold, SSL, etc., and could not say,
but that I suspected strongly that the claim was made just as a "tweak" of
C2Net. "Truth is an absolute defence against libel claims."
(P.S. To repeat, I doubt there is a flaw in Stronghold, either introduced
by RSA (Republic of South Africa, of course) or by the NSA, or by C2Net, or
by anyone else. I said as much in my messages which never made it to the

I think this filtering/censorship stuff is getting way too complicated
to be practical.  It is in my opinion inappropriate to moderate or
automatically filter the list itself, because that is a form of
censorship.  Expecting people to install and use new software is
asking too much.
The way I see it, you have several simple options:
1) read everything, and hit d when you decide a post is noise
2) filter at your own machine - there's lots of software.  Presumably
those requesting list server user controlled filtering are saying that
they find it too much hassle to install or learn how to use such
software, or that they don't want to pay for downloading garbage
3) start up a mailing list mirror, subscribe the mirror to
cypherpunks at toad.com, and implement user controlled filtering in
majordomo on the mirror.  This frees up some of toad.com's current
load, and puts all filtering load on the mirror.  If there's a demand
for such a service, someone can do it.
4) subscribe to a filtered version of cypherpunks, and run the risk
that the owner filters material which would be interesting to you.
5) setup a filtered version of cypherpunks which explicitly filters
just commercial spam, and mail loop errors.
Currently I use method 1.  A couple of people lately have so
consistently posted garbage that I am considering it may be worth the
effort of switching to method 2.  If someone did 5 and the delay was
reasonably short, I would probably subscribe to it.
The only thing I would be happy to see happen in the way of list based
filtering, is anything to cut out pure commercial, non crypto related
spam.  Spammers seem to have discovered mailing lists as efficient
distribution methods in addition to direct mass mailing lately.
Unfortunately this is difficult to filter automatically, and no one
has the time to do it in close to real time, and time lags hinder

@_subject: Newt's phone calls 
Eric's phone I thought operated as a bump in the line for landline.
The phone was acting as a speaker and microphone, and also is used to
make the connection via tone dial?  The `bump' switched to 14.4k modem
when you pressed go secure, and did A/D, D/A, encrypt, and decrypt.
An encrypting cell-phone would be an interesting project.
What about starting from a digital GSM phone - it already has all the
A/D, and ability to maintain digital connection across hand-offs.
I would have thought the extra hardware would be minimal - a RISC chip
with on chip RAM and EPROM to encrypt and decrypt.
GSM includes A5 encryption here, so basically the whole design is worked out
- all you'd have to do is rip out the A5 chip and replace with a decent
encryption system.  Anyone know how modular the design is, for instance if
it would be possible to give a GSM A5 based cell phone a crypto upgrade
using published electrical interface standards?  (I want one of those -
Nokia phone with IDEA + 2048 bit RSA signatures + DH forward secrecy!)

Using GSM would add protection against casual eavesdroppers, but would
not provide that high a degree of protection.
GSM encrypts only the links to the station - the traffic goes in the
clear through the station.  Plus A5 (crypto algorithm used in GSM) is
weak, 40 bits of effective key space.
It could be worse to have poor crypto, than no crypto,

If you super-encrypted the IDEA encrypted traffic with A5, it should
not require cooperation of the cell phone provider.  You always need a
capable device at the other end.  If the phone at the other end isn't
IDEA/RSA/DH capable, you can fall back to only A5.
My question about electrical interfaces was wondering if the above
could be acheived by producing a plugable mini-smartcard, or
desolderable IC which would allow this to be done with standard GSM
Not from Newt's eavesdroppers sure, but it wouldn't cost that much for
someone who wanted the traffic.  40 bits of effective key space at

So the question was (addressed to anyone who knows anything about the
electrical interfaces used in GSM) about standardisation of electrical
interfaces -- for instace if the electrical interface between the
voice compression/decompression IC and A5 IC were standardised, you
could build a replacement voice codec IC which performed IDEA/RSA/DH
as well as standard the voice codec function, and had the same pin
out.  This IC would allow a wide range of GSM phones to be upgraded
with minimal effort on the part of GSM phone manufacturers -- or even
desoldered and replaced by end users, or crypto hardware company.
However, there are several reasons why it would probably require
proper integration into a GSM phone design:
- keys tied to phone number memories
- display of signature result on screen
- PIN for phone's RSA signature keys
- face to face key exchange
- key revocation
- generating new keys

@_subject: Dr Vulis's crypto experiment (Re: IMDMP: SOURCE CODE RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT) 
It's occured to me recently that Dimitri's posts are not being read
correctly, it is not the content which is the point, nor the
superficial lack of crypto relevance.
Dimitri is an intelligent guy, and has a high level of crypto
expertise (he has a PhD on a cryptography topic).  It is my belief
that his posts can only be understood in a "meta" sense -- he is
engaged in a highly complex cryptographic experiment.  People who read
and respond to his individual posts are the unwitting subjects in his
experiments.  His posts and the responses to them are actually the
data-set for a thorough cryptanalysis of mailing list threats.  His
current topic under investigation is Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
on mailing lists.
Denial of service on mailing lists is a complex business, and requires
expert human input to be done properly.
Dimitri has systematically explored these types of posting behaviour:
1. Posting only crypto relevant material.
2. Interspersing crypto relevant posts with hand personalised flame bait.
3. Interspersing crypto relevant posts with bot generated flame bait.
4. Interspersing crypto relevant posts with news stories.
5. Posting only non crypto relevant material.
The alert reader will recall these phases of posting style (currently
we are in sub experiment 5, the other phases have occured over a
protracted period of intensive experimentation, and some newer readers
may have missed earlier phases).
There were other experiments which may or may not have been part of
Dimitri's series of DoS experiments:
6. Subscribing the list to itself (testing list resilience to recursion)
7. Forging posts to carefully selected newsgroups with
"cypherpunks at toad.com" as the sender (this indirectly adds user
"cypherpunks at toad.com" to many direct marketing lists as direct
marketers make use of email addresses scanned from newsgroups).
8. The "UNSCRIVE" and other spelling variations of "unsubscribe" epidemic,
and ensuing instructions and discussion
9. Subscribing the list to other lists
10. Bot generated flame bait posted anonymously (with ascii art)
reference to the transition from phase 4 of the experiments to the
current phase, phase 5 (the reader will also note references to experimental
results c and d described below):
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
More widely read cypherpunks will know that Dimitri has performed
similar experiments in other fora -- his systematic experiments in
numerous USENET newsgroups resulted in the his receiving the
prestigious KOTM ("Kook Of The Month") award.
His main experimental results to date with the cypherpunks mailing
list series of experiments have been:
a) many cypherpunks publically announcing kill filing him
b) numerous cypherpunks suggesting censoring him (a particularly
interesting result considering the libertarian leanings of many on
this list)
c) the outstanding experimental result of being forcibly unsubscribed
from the list, and of being barred from resubscribing by John Gilmore.
(creator of alt.* USENET newsgroup hierarchy, and well know freespeech
d) another interesting, incidental experimental result was provided by
Declan McCullagh in his Netly News piece in prematurely, and entirely
unwittingly, publishing some of Dimitri's expermiental data-set.
e) the main experimental result: the list shortly moving to a
moderated form, seemingly at the request of Sandy Sandfort, with
agreement from John Gilmore.
These experimental results are quite significant, when taken in the
context of the anti-censorship, libertarian, pro-freespeech
environment of the cypherpunks mailing list.  Dimitri should be
congratulated on his outstanding work.
I await with interest the last phases of Dimitri's experiment, when
the cypherpunks list becomes a moderated forum.  My suggestions for
interesting experiments during the moderated phase are:
1. Testing the limits of Dale Thorn's anti-censorship sentiments (for
those who don't read Dale, he is subscribed to "cypherpunks-unedited"
in preparation for the moderation).
2. Testing Sandy Sandforts rejection criteria.
3. Testing Sandy Sandforts rejection rate for long crypto relevant
posts interspersed with irrelevant flame bait.
4. Testing Sandy Sandforts rejection rate for posts with flame bait .sigs
I hope Dimitri's selfless efforts in furthering understanding of DoS
attacks on mailing lists is properly acknowledged when he publishes
his findings on completion of his experiments.  I also hope that
Dimitri will document his recommendations for mailing list
configuration and management in light of his experiments.

@_subject: Eternity (was Re: CPAC, XtatiX, and the Censor-State) 
You two must've been snoozing when I posted the Eternity service
announce back in April.  I implemented something which does pretty
much exactly what you're discussing.  I'll include a repost below.
I must've been doing something right, I read your practical glitches,
and went yup x 4 :-)
So beyond implementing it, which I've done a first cut of, the next
problem is getting people to use it, to advertise it so that people
know it exists, to get people to put lots of "interesting" (=
otherwise censored, so possibly pretty interesting) materials on it,
so that people find it interesting to browse documents on it.
I'm working on an article for Phrack 51 on it, as I thought the Phrack
audience a suitable one for folks interested in publishing interesting
materials (warez, hacking, cracking hints, tips, liberated information,
and some more on the less savoury side perhaps, CC numbers, calling
card numbers, etc).
A real boon would be a working demo system, and I still haven't set
one up myself.  As I said back in April: any takers.
My implementation doesn't require browser plug-ins.  It would require
that or a local proxy for better security, but a quick 'n easy is
probably a better starting point.  (Much like web based remailer
interfaces are ok things to introduce people to remailers, almost zero
set up, easy to use etc.)
One thing I didn't see you mention was the idea to use the web based
news archival services to get around the problem of news expiry.  I
haven't implemented those parts, as I was kind of hoping the idea
would take off and someone would thereby be motivated to contribute
the code.
The only novel thing is that the URL hashes which I was using for a
subject line (read reposted announce for why I do this) don't seem to
be indexed by the search engines (neither dejanews, nor altavista).
An idea I had to work around this was to use something like texto,
where you just use a group of words to encode the number.  Or I think
you can get away with numbers under a certain length.  So perhaps in
encoding url hashing to: 22596363 B3DE40B0 6F981FB8 5D82312E 8C0ED511 you
could convert to base-10, and group into whatever digit numbers:
Then do a web search for:
576283491+ 3017687216+ 1872240568+ 1568813358+ 2349782289+

What is an Eternity Service?
(Some of you may recognize the name `Eternity Service' from Ross
Anderson's paper of that name.  What I have implemented is a related
type of service which shares Anderson's design goals, but has a
simpler design.  Rather than invent a new name, I just borrowed
Anderson's, unless anyone can think of a better name. Anderson has the
paper available on his web pages (look for `eternity') at
 Also I heard that Eric Hughes
gave a talk on UPS `Universal Piracy Service' I presume this has
similar design goals, though I have not heard further details.)
I have implemented this to give something concrete to think about in
terms of creating something closer to Andersons real eternity service
in robustness.
The eternity server code above provides an interface to a distributed
document store which allows you to publish web pages in such a way
that the attacker (the attacker here is a censor such as perhaps a
government, perhaps your government) can not force you to unpublish
the document.
It's architecture is quite simple.  We already have an extremely
robust distributed document store: USENET news.  We already have the
ability to post messages to the document store anonymously: type I and
type II (mixmaster) remailers.  So theoretically we can publish what
ever we want, just post it to USENET.  However retreiving the data is
cumbersome.  We must search USENET with a search engine, or look
manually for the document, the document will expire after some short
time.  You may still be able to find the document in a search engine
which archives news for longer periods such as dejanews or altavista.
However, it is not as user friendly as a web based interface, there
are no hypertext links between related documents, there are no inline
graphics, etc.
So my `eternity server' is a kind of specialised web search engine
which acts as a kind of web proxy and provides a persistent web based
interface to reading web pages stored in encrypted documents posted to
different USENET groups.  The web search engine provides persitent
virtual URLs for documents even if they move around with different in
different news groups, being posted via different exit remailers.
Signatures on documents allows the user to update document.  The web
proxy has options to cache documents, and otherwise fetches from
a USENET newsspool or nntp news server.
Technical Description
The system offers different levels of security to users.  All
documents must be encrypted.  The subject field of the document should
include the SHA1 hash of the document's virtual URL.  (All eternity
virtual urls are of the form:
that is they would not function as normal urls because the use the
non-existant TLD "eternity".  You may be able to use this facility to
get your browser to look at a particular eternity server to serve
documents of this form).
The lowest level of security is to encrypt the document with PGP -c
(IDEA encryption) with the passphrase "eternity".  This is just
obfuscation to make the documents marginally harder to examine in
USENET without using the eternity service to automate the process.
The next level of security is encrypt the document with the SHA1 of a
1 prepended with the URL.  ie This means that you can not read documents unless you know the URL.
Of course, if you can guess the URL then you can read them.
The third level of security is to additionally to one of the above two
options to encrypt the document with another passphrase of your
chosing.  Then you can give the passphrase only to those amongst your
circle of friends.
Additionally support is given for signed documents.  This is important
because once you've published a web page you might wish to update it.
And yet you don't want other people updating it with a blank page (or
otherwise changing your page) as this would be as good as the ability
to remove the page.
If you include a PGP public key with a document, the eternity server
will associate that PGP key with the hash of your documents URL.  Any
attempts to update that document will only succeed if signed by the
same PGP key.
The document server has the option to cache documents.  Cacheing can
either be turned off (in which case documents are always fetched from
the news spool, this is not that inefficient as the news spool may be
local, and the server keeps a database of USENET group/article number
against document hash, and so can directly fetch the document), or
cacheing can be turned on, or cacheing can be set to encrypted, in
which case documents in the cache are encrypted with a passphrase
derived from the SHA1 of the document's URL by prepending a 1 to the
URL.  In the encrypted mode if the server operator is not keeping
logs, he can't decrypt the documents in his own cache.  If cacheing is
off there are no documents in the cache, only in the USENET news
In addition some users will have a password which is pasted into an
extra password field on the field
Users can set their own per document cacheing options (they can set no
cacheing to override the options of on or encrypted on the server), or
they can set encrytped to override cachine turned on, etc.
There is a document index at eternity root ( " ), and
users may optionally request documents to be included in the directory
of eternity documents and virtual hosts.  It makes sense to include
the root document of your set of web pages in the index, and to leave
the rest out of the index.  Then you can link to your own pages from
your original page.
Relative URLs work, inline graphics work, site relative URLs work, and
it includes crude support for mime types, so most normal web data
types will work as normal.
The document format is:
[pgp key]
[eternity document]
The flags are can be any of:
URL: Options: directory or exdirectory
Cache: on/yes/off/no/encrypt/encrypted
Description: An example eternity document
The pgp key is an asii armored PGP key, and the eternity document must
also be ascii armored and may optionally be signed (with the
acompanying pgp key).  The eternity document can also be encrypted
again inside that layer with a user key which need never be revealed
to the server.
The overall document is encrypted with PGP -c password "eternity", or
with a password obtained by prepending a 1 to the URL as obtained like
% echo -c 1" | sha1
The flags, pgp key and eternity document can be arbitrarily jumbled
up in order.
The eternity server source code includes an examples directory.
The eternity server has a configuration file which is heavily
commented: eternity.conf.
Threat Models
Think of this as a specialised search engine. If you don't like the
documents you find, then change your search terms, don't complain to
one of the many search engine maintainers! The Eternity Service is
designed to facilitate publishing in a web based form of non
government approved reading or viewing material, or the publishing of
non government approved software, or other "liberated" documents,
programs, etc.  Each user can easily install their own search engine
in a shell account for their own use.
Newsgroups are very robust against attack because they are part of a
distributed system: USENET news. It is difficult to remove a USENET
newsgroup (the Scientologists know, they tried and failed, and they
have seriously deep pockets, and attitude to match). For the eternity
service it probably doesn't matter that much if you do get rid of a
particular newsgroup, eternity documents can be in any
newsgroup. Somehow I don't think you'll succeed in getting rid of all
USENET newsgroups, ie in shutting USENET news down. I'm not sure that
a major government could succeed in that even.
Information wants to be free. Long live USENET news.
Improving robustness
The main problem with this system that I see is that documents don't
live long in USENET news spools as expiry dates are often 1 week or
less.  So to use the service you'd have to set up a cron job to repost
your web documents every week or so.  Some documents remain in the
cache and so survive as long as there is interest in them.
An immediately easy thing to do is to include support for fetching and
looking documents up in altavista's news archive and in dejanews
archive.  This shouldn't be that difficult.  The eternity server
article database already includes newsgroup and message id against
document hash, all that is required is to formulate the requests
correctly.  If anyone wants to add this, feel free.
A mechanism for eternity servers to query each other's caches would be
one mechanism to think about.
Another would be to charge anonymous digicash rates to keep documents
in the cache a couple of $ per Mb/year.
Also you could perhaps think about charging for acccesses to the
service and passing a royalty back to the document author.
There is no `ownership' of eternity virtual domains, or of document
paths.  If Alice puts a document at  there is
nothing to stop Bob putting other files under that virtual domain,
such as   However in general Bob can't
make Alice's document point to his URLs.  Bob can't modify or remove
Alice's pointer from the eternity directry   But he
can add his own entry.
There can however be race conditions.  If Alice puts up a document on
 which points to an inline gif, but hasn't yet
put up that inline gif, Bob can get there first and put up a picture
of Barney until Alice notices and changes here pointer to point to the
picture she wants to point at.
So one solution would be to only accept documents which are signed by
the signator of the next domain up.  First come first served for the
virtual domains, the key signing the root dir of the virtual domain is
checked for each file or directory added under that.
Note even if the URLs are exdirectory, this need not be a problem as
you can just try the path with one directory stripped off.  Could be
done.  Is it worth it though?  It would add overhead to the server,
and there is minimal distruption someone can cause by sharing domains.
Perhaps it is desirable for someone to own a domain by virtue of being
the first person to submit a document with the hash of that domain
together with a key.
The rest of this document is things on the to do list, if you feel
like helping out, or discover a limitation or bug.
To do list
It could do with some documentation.  And some stress testing.  The
file locking hasn't really been tested much.  NNTP may be flaky
as I made some mods since last debugging.
It would be nice to have a CGI based form to submitting documents.
Paste signed ascii armored document here.  Paste public key here.
Click radio buttons to choose options.  Enter URL here.  Type in
newsgroup to send to. Click here to submit through a chain of
mixmaster remailers.
There are a few bugs in the above system which ought to be fixed, but
this is alpha code, and they are on the TODO list.  One problem is
that the flags aren't signed.  A change of message format will fix
that in a later version.  The basic problem is that you can't check
the signature until you've decrypted and obtained the key.  At which
point you have to decrypt again.  A simple fix would perhaps to be to
put the public key outside the outer encryption envelope, but that is
unattractive in terms of allowing author correlation even by people
who don't have passphrases or don't know URLs.  Better would be to
just decrypt once, obtain the key if there is one, and then check the
sig again.  The server already keeps a database of PGP keys (not using
PGP's keyring) it stores keys by the SHA1 hash of the armored public
key and indexes against document URL hashes.  In this way public keys
do not need to be included in later document updates.  This could be
used to check a signature on the outer encryption layer.  Then only
the first post needs to decrypt twice (once without key available to
check sig, and then again with key available).  As a nice side effect
this protects against the PGP 0xdeadbeef attack (or 0xc001d00d as Gary
Howland has on his public key).
Another problem is when scanning a newsgroup, if the scanned message
can not be read it just stores it for later, so that when someone
accesses the server who knows the URL for that document it can be
decrypted and scanned for good signature and updated then.  However
the code only has a place holder for one document at the moment.  That
should be changed to a list and appropriate code to scan the list when
the document is accessed.  Once the newest document is found, the list
of documents to be scanned can be discarded and the newest article
stored against the hash in article.db.
Another more subtle problem is that the code may update documents in
the wrong order if multiple versions are posted to different news
groups.  The articles are scanned one group at a time.  So if the
groups are scanned in order alt.anonymous.messages followed by
alt.cypherpunks, and version 2 of the document is in alt.anon.msgs,
and version 1 in alt.cp, then it will update the document with the
older version.
Another to do list entry is the cache replacement policy.  There isn't
one, your cache will grow indefinately as documents are never removed.
Another thing to do is the altavista and dejanews lookup via HTTP by
message-id.  All the place holders are there.
If anyone wants to tackle any of the above tasks feel free.
The program dbmdump prints out .db files in ascii so you can see what
is there.
eternity -u is suitable to run as a cron job, or just at the console.
eternity -r resets everything, clears out the cache, empties database
is the form to use as a cgi.  It handles both GET and POST methods.
There is a log file for debugging, see eternity (the perl program) for
how to set different logging opitons. You can log most aspects of the
program for debugging purposes.

@_subject: Eternity (was Re: CPAC, XtatiX, and the Censor-State) 
I "borrowed" the name from Ross Anderson I think it comes from
something called an eternity machine.  Perhaps a more descriptive name
would help?  USEWEB?  ALT web?  (Have URLs of the form Yes, running an eternity server is going to have similar if not worse
operator harrassment problems than running remailers.  I've been
subscribed to remop  for a while
now, and remailer operators take no end of flak.
Once it gets going perhaps people can use their own personal eternity
server, a server for their own use only.  That at least directs
criticism to USENET admins, news archiving search engines, and
remailer operators (the exit remailers on the actual posts).
I'm confident that USENET can take the strain.  The average of
newsadmins doesn't honor cancels, and won't be bothered, or will be
hostile to the notion of canceling articles on the request of kooky
censors.  Search engines might be persuaded to delete posts from their
archives in the extreme.  I understand that the poster can request
posts removed from altavista.  Perhaps with enough harrassment
altavista might be coerced into removing other peoples posts.
The obfuscation of encrypting with pgp -c and password "eternity"
should help in that the documents are not directly readable.  At least
one of the search engines does not archive uuencoded posts.  It does
archive PGP radix-64 encoded posts.  Perhaps that would change if
censors created enough of a nuisance of themselves.
If they do stop archiving radix-64 we can switch to texto (crude text
stego app, which is kicking around the net somewhere).
Just view it as a temporary, disposable service.  When the heat gets
turned up to the stage where you receive bonafide legal letters,
disable it, and let someone else start some servers.  All the
documents will survive, as they live in USENET spools, and in search
engines USENET archives.

@_subject: non-censorous spam control (was Re: Spam is Information?) 
A good post.  Your notice-board analogy was reasonable.
How about this as a stop gap measure: rather than sending cancels for
spams posted to multiple newsgroups, simply modify the distribution.
That is cancel all but one groups worth of articles, and then modify
the Newsgroups line to cross-post to all the groups the article was
originally posted to.
That way you are not as such "cancelling" anything as a net result,
but are just "compressing" your news spool or downstream feed, no
information is lost (other than the information that the poster is
clueless and doesn't know how to cross-post, which is now disguised by
a compression agent trawling through the news spool fixing things up).
Sound reasonable?
If news admins, or others getting involved with issuing forged cancels
are not willing to do this it suggests that they are making judgements
about the content of the posts as well as claiming to want to save
Another longer term way to improve the situation is to charge some
small token amount per article, just to encourage people to use it
with some intelligence (use cross posts rather than separately
reposting to each group).
It is also entirely possible for people to have 'bots which auto-post
in response to articles matching keywords, or matching authors.
(We've seen a few of these on cypherpunks).
If people want to make a nuisance for others by spewing random garbage
via bots to newsgroups, they could post mega bytes of stuff per day
and swamp the content.  What can you do about this?  Charging a small
amount per post, or per megabyte would provide a small disincentive
for this type of behaviour.  However it would never reflect the true
cost to USENET bandwidth as a whole.
One interesting idea which has been floated on this list in the past
is for authors to have their free posting rate moderated by other
peoples ratings of their posts.
One way to implement this is for other people to pay the author for
their articles a penny if they like the article.  That way people who
write things which others find interesting to read get subsidized
posting.  Is it still free speech if you have to pay for your posts if
you're arguing for an unpopular minority?
Also, this might be an interesting information market model because
technical experts might even find themselves with a well paid job of
answering technical questions in newsgroups.

However, and this appears to be a point being missed here, it is

what is suitable.

It would seem that they are arguing that it is a good thing because it

Foo on that.
It's censorship.  If you didn't write it, you have no business
cancelling it.
NoCems are a good solution to mailing list and USENET groups spams.
Then each person can take their pick of which posters article ratings
to use, or can create their own rating service.
For email spams (not talking about cancels here), I'd suggest
attaching electronic payment to emails as a condition of delivery.
A temporary fix for emails, or another approach, is to use hashcash.
Hashcash is a token of CPU time.  It proves that the sender has
consumed a given number of seconds/minutes/hours CPU time.  The
receiver sets their software to reject mail (bounce with explanation,
or put into potential spam folder) to squelch out spam.

@_subject: uncensorable net based payment system? 
The internet looks like it is slowly moving towards anonymous
micropayments for services, and metering for scarce resources.
One presumes that in 10-15 years time frame such payments will be
pervasive.  In such an environment where you can buy bandwidth per Mb
at your chosen bit-rate for anonymous ecash, and buy storage per
Mb/year, and CPU time per MIPs/year there will be a large amount of
readily marketable resources.
That is to say high velocity efficient markets will arise for resale
of bandwidth, storage and CPU hours.
The interesting question then is can we actually base an entirely net
based currency on trading of these resources.  What would the
architecture for such a payment system look like?  Design goals would
be that it should be:
Then I can have some net cash savings backed by the rights to 1Tb
of bandwidth at 100 Mb/sec.  100 Mb/sec for 3 days.
A problem with this is that the market prices of the assets is
continually dropping.  How do I hedge against this.  Can I buy
futures?  Sell 100 Mb/sec for 3 days now in exchange for 200 Mb/sec
for 3 days in 1 years time at an predicted equivalent value?

@_subject: Eternity Server 0.04 Available 
What you say is probably true of the web index, but eternity uses
their USENET archive.  They seem to be keeping up with that.
There are a few altavistas around now.  I use one in europe somewhere
as it has faster net connectivity from where I am.
The idea of using altavista, dejanews, etc is really just a temporary
measure.  The long term goal is more abitious, but to garner interest
in eternity something has to be demonstrated first.
If someone said to you at this point that a useful resource like alt
USENET news was being cancelled forthwith, the hackers amongst those
that enjoy reading it would get together and rehost it somehow.
Here's one possible route to having a standalone distributed set of
eternity servers which does not rely on the borrowed resources of the
news search engines archives.  Modify USENET news distribution
software so that instead of expiring articles, it keeps around
articles for which there was either a direct payment made out for that
USENET node, or for which there are many requests (with micropayments)
to make it profitable to keep that article around.
The idea is to ensure that the use of the USENET node for eternity
purposes is self-funding.  If a node finds itself hosting lots of
eternity documents, it will generate enough funds to buy a bigger
Disks are cheap and getting cheaper.  I bought a 3.8Gb disk for $300 a
while back.  Reckon you could buy a 6Gb for the same price now, and
that was only a few months ago.  Probably around 5c per meg.
So here's the model: I want to post something which some government
would like to censor.  I include a storage fee of $1 digicash per
megabyte-year with my anonymous eternity document submission to USENET
cashable to a node of my choice.  (Or several payments for different
USENET nodes if I want the redundancy).
Now on top of this the USENET nodes can charge for NNTP access to that
document.  1c per meg or something to add to their profits, and to
cover bandwidth consumption.
Then we have a recursive auction market amongst USENET sites so that
if a site that does not have the article is asked for it, it will go
buy a copy from any node which will volunteer it for sale.  Then that
site will re-sell it multiple times to recuperate the buy price.
This can occur recursively, even small players with PPP lines can
participate by buying pages and re-selling them at a lower price to
reflect the poorer performance.
The way eternity is set up at the moment it is entirely feasible that
the re-seller of the eternity article would not know what it was they
were serving.
All the technology is here now (not all the software, but all the
technology, ecash, USENET, PGP signatures, encryption).  All we've got
to do is the proselytizing, advertising, putting juicy information up.
Heck I reckon perhaps if I code the USENET article reselling and
archiving stuff, I should put in a 1% royalty cut :-) 1% of eternity
document sales and storage charges might be a shit-load of money in a
few years.

Here's the problem: once you start censoring anything, you've started
on the slippery slope.  Everyone has their pet things which annoy
Newsadmins who auto-cancel cross-posts are acting counter-productively
and censorously.  Cross-posts result in only one copy in the
news-spool.  Most newsreaders will only display the article once to
each reader -- it doesn't save the readers time to cancel 99 of the
100 articles leaving 1 in a random group.  Probably these admins are
cancelling all 100 on the assumption that anything cross posted that
widely is garbage anyway.  That is a value judgement and something I'd
prefer not done to a newsfeed I read.  Dumb spammers who individually post to each of 100 groups are the ones
who really consume bandwidth.  What they should be doing is
compressing their news spools and down-stream feeds by converting the
same article individually posted to many groups to articles
cross-posted to the same set of groups.
If they take issue with the number of posts an individual is making
total (eg a bot perhaps auto posting in response to articles
containing certain keywords), they should be thinking of working
towards a (low) postage requirement for each post.  Hashcash might be
an interesting interim payment method.
That'll slow down the bots and people who repost large posts too
Other than that I think getting involved in cancelling posts is
getting dubious.  A better way to do register your negative opinion of
some posts is to issue NoCems.

I wasn't thinking of using the bandwidth myself, just using it as a

but some people use it (jewelers, circuitry, etc), and those people's
demand give's it value.  There demand + other speculators such as
myself defines the current market price.
So I was thinking that this bandwidth would be readily transferable as
there will always be people on the look out for a good buy for their
bandwidth.  If you're going to auction off unused bandwidth on leased
pipes etc, there will be people dynamically buying bandwidth at the
best price they can get.
ATM?  Virtual ATM?  We were talking 10-15 years time frame there.
Guaranteed bandwidth virtual pipes have got to come for metering to
make sense.  Metering is going to come for some aspects of the net
sooner or later.  Even if you buy outright your leased line and all
the bandwidth on it, it will be more efficient if you can sell off
spare bandwidth during your weekends and evenings.  Also you could
underbuy your bandwidth if you knew with an acceptable degree of
certainty that you could buy in the extra bandwidth as needed in an
efficient market.

Are you opposed to free markets?
Government holds a number of monopolies.  These monopolies are not
efficient.  They result in resource wastage on a mind boggling scale.
The USG has pretty much bankrupt your country, the US national debt
being I understand at a level where US citizens collectively do not
have the resources to pay it off.  If a privately or publicly held
company got to that stage the receivers would be sent in. The success that a country does enjoy is pretty much proportional to
the degree of market freedom.  Luckily for us our governments have
left a bit of freedom in markets, or we would have food shortages, and
In economies with extremely low amounts of market freedom, the readily
observable inefficiency demonstrates my point.  (eg Former Soviet
Union communist economy).
Governments tend to grow, and soak up larger tax percentages, and
encroach into more aspects of life which were previously a question of
free choice, or were previously purely market driven.  The reason for
this growth is due to the government as an entity unconciously
promoting itself as an organism.  A great huge cancerous growth which
has us by the jugular.
The reason governments as businesses can get away with their abysmal
performance is because they have a near complete monopoly.
A good start would be a choice in government, to generate some
competition.  So you can buy membership in a protection racket, hire
the services of a private security firm, or buy insurance from an
insurance group because of its benefits package, or go elsewhere if
the offering sucks.  You choose on an individual basis what package
best suits you, and you choose the service providers who you consider
as the best value for money.
eg. I can go buy into Uncle Enzo's pizza delivery and protection
racket because the protection is 5000% better value for money than the
Feds deal.
I can pick and choose the services I want to produce a mix which
satisfies me.  Double efficiency, people don't have services provided
for them which they actively don't want, and I can buy services which

Are you serious?  Or are you pulling our leg?
People write crap software.  Microsoft writes crap software.  If the
OS reboots or freezes every time a microsoft app dumps core on you, it
gets tedious.  If you are developing software you don't want a reboot
just 'cause you got a stray pointer.
Real multi-tasking is kind of nice too, like when the mouse cursor
still functions, and your system still runs while copying a file to a
floppy disk.  (The entire system freezes for the duration of the

William Geiger  writes
Personally I would be happy for all UK police and military forces to
pull out of Northern Ireland.  Give it back to them, see if I care.
What difference can it make to me?  Foreign intervention is a waste of
time in my book.
However, here are a few things you might be interested to know.  I
understand the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want to
be part of Southern Ireland.  The people in NI have been there for
multiple generations, and probably also don't want to be relocated to
England.  Many of these people are English descent and their ancestors
where given land by the British government which was stolen from
native Irish about 300 years ago.  They have also intermarried.
British government was brutal at that time, before they turned soft
and lost their empire.  (You might see parallels with the US, where
you guys are also living on stolen property).
Perhaps most NI people would not actually be that badly off if they
were part of SI.
You should also realise that IRA and supporters are minority in NI
today, for a sense of perspective.
In the mean time the IRA and the opposing paramilitary organisation
blow up, assasinate, knee-cap each other, protestants, catholics, joy
riders, and a few innocent bystanders, and I think both deal in drugs,
and are involved in organised crime to fund their activities.  IRA
makes attempts to blow up UK politicians.  Managed to smuggle rocket
launcher in van with hole cut in roof to within a few hundred yards of
10 Downing St.  But they missed.  (Dimitri says: shame, shame, and
increases Sinn Fein campaign contributions in the hope they are better
funded next time.)
(I forget name, but there is a non-governmental paramilitary group on
other side to IRA in NI, occasionally there is rumor that British Army
is feeding this paramilitary organisation names of IRA suspects to
hit, to save them the trouble).
You guys remember the Faulkland Islands thing under Thatcher?  Some
miniscule lump of rock with a few hundred sheep farmers on it?  UK
government sent warships etc at multiple billion cost.  Would've been
cheaper to desert rock, and give each and every inhabitant a cool $1
million relocation expenses.  But no, had to waste money because some
alterior motive, suitable missile outpost or something.
Wonder what the interest is in Northern Ireland?
Should give the Irish (go Paddy) back Northern Ireland, Scottish
autonomy also (haggis home rule:-).  Wales (leeks) too, yeah.
Fragmented government is a good thing, divide and conquer.  I
understand the Muslims want their own government over here also!
Some Scottish people want home rule (Scottish Independence Party?),
they had a vote on it and lost a while back.  Wales is a poor part of
the country, some richer people have bought second home holiday
cottages in picturesque welsh country side.  Result: drives up prices
for poorer locals.  A few welsh started burning down such cottages.
Some Welsh also want independence.  They have road signs in English
and in a language which most of the locals can't even read.  Similar
thing in Southern Ireland.  (Desparately hanging on to heritage).
ps Paddy is generic name for an Irishman, a haggis is a stuffed part
of sheeps anatomy, a peculiar highland delicacy, nick name for
Scotsman, leek is a vegetable, some kind of Welsh emblem, and used as

@_subject: PGP key fingerprint spoofing 
Well we're all aware of the 0xDEADBEEF attack, right?  (PGP keyids,
are the 8 hex digit number which PGP recognizes a key by.  The
0xDEADBEEF attack (so christened by Greg Rose one of the people who
independently rediscovered this attack) is where you generate a PGP
key which has the same key id as someone else's key.  This could
confuse a keyserver, or a user into using the wrong key.  This attack
is fairly easy to do, just choose p ending in 0xDEADBEEF (or whatever
the desired key id is), then start with q ending in 0x00000001, and
add some value larger than 0xFFFFFFFF at each iteration doing your
primality test, the p and q will then multiply to have the desired
least significant bits of n).  You may also have noticed that Gary
Howland has a keyid of 0xc001d00d ("cool dude", get it).
Anyway it seems that you can spoof the finger print also indirectly,
which is much less obvious, as the fingerprint is the MD5 hash of the
RSA modulus concatenated with the RSA public exponent.
This was described recently on coderpunks.  (I was forced to eat my
words on coderpunks after declaring this was impossible without an
exploitable flaw in MD5 or brute force of 2**128 bit search space,
when someone explained the concatenation weakness).  I'm not sure who
it was that discovered this attack, or which list/newsgroup this was
announced on, but this was the first I had seen it discussed.
The concatenation is the weakness, as if you have an RSA key of:
n = 0x1234567
e = 0x11
Then you can try n = 0x12345, and e = 0x6711.  So you try factoring
each n of this form, and if it has two factors p and q, then you can
construct a key with the same fingerprint, but with different key.
Anyone who bothers to would be able to factor 0x1234567 also, so it is
not secure, but if you can fool someone into using this key in place
of the real one, you can get their communications.  It will be much
easier to fool someone to use this key as the fingerprint is the same!
Here's an example...
Say we have a 1024 bit key, say e is small ( < 256).  That means
n || e is 129 bytes long.
The e value must be represented by a whole byte.  n can't be smaller
than 384 bits (or PGP will reject it as too small to hold the required
idea message key and padding), so that will give us 80 possible values
for e and n.  Lets use my 1024 bit key for an example.
n = 0x99d61071378ee2c0c8c9c4b7786b203dedf2d6e526f24f7e83f3e0f960fb66b9

e = 0x13
So we could try:
e = 0x6713
e = 0x4a6713
e = 0x6a4a6713
n = 0x99d61071378ee2c0c8c9c4b7786b203dedf2d6e526f24f7e83f3e0f960fb66b9

Note the identical fingerprints!  (Awesome).
Key id of course is different.
Also note that you can't decrypt directly with PGP, as I suspected,
because the chinese remainder theorem used in decrypt to speed up the
works barfs on small p.  You can hack around that if you're bothered.
It might be possible to find a spoofed fingerprint key with large p
and q, so that this was not a problem.
Below this post is my real key.
This is a major security flaw, and I take my hat off to the guy who
discovered it.
As others noted (who were aware of this flaw) the solution is to
consider the keyid as part of the fingerprint.  That reduces by a
factor of 2^32 the likelihood of the attack succeeding.  I suspect
that rules out the attack working for most keys.  Also be suspicous of
odd sized keys.  Now if someones 2048 bit key has a 1024 bit spoof,
you're in trouble.  I'd be interested in estimates of the likelihood
of this being possible for a randomly selected key.
You could construct a key where the keyid matched, and the fingerprint
matched for two different keys, using a combination of dead beef
attack, and brute force to find a key with the keyid appearing two
places in the key, and then trying to factor the n value at that
point.  Shouldn't take long.
As far as PGP format goes, adding the length field into the digest
would go along way towards fixing it.  (Length fields for pgp big int
representation is big endian 16 bit word representing length of
following big int in bits).
There might still be a small chance of doing the fingerprint spoof
where the length fields both happened to be right.  As you require a
specific length field it would seem this attack would be 2^32 times
less likely to succeed.  This would make most keys safe.  I wonder if
there exists a key out there which would fall to this attack.
(btw for people playing with this stuff, a useful program is
pgpacket.pl by Mark Shoulsen, which displays pgp packets as hex
numbers, see ftp.ox.ac.uk/pgp somewhere under utils).
My real key, so you can compare fingerprints.

Well I agree.  However I would guess that the people of NI could claim
if it suited that they _were_ english, and that the UK government was
therefor bound to provide military support, in the same way as for
borough of London say when it gets bombed by IRA.
That's socialism for you.  Say in the south of england (relatively
wealthy) we'd be better off if we didn't pay taxes to keep all the
unemployed in the north.
That's called democracy you each vote to steal from other voters :-)
I did hear that in the UK we'll all be in the minority to muslims by
2000 something for similar reasons.  (Don't have figures to back that
up, I'd guess it's exaggerated, but the trend is there, some
religions/nationalities have 6+ children each, whereas your average
honky has 1 or 2).
State police military is a socialist thing, the fact that they have
some claim to be english is enough justification in the eyes of
policians to interfere.  Obviously it's historical also.
IRA isn't at all popular in the UK either, peoples reactions are more
extreme than the UK military over there.  UK military is on best
behaviour, rules of engagement of no fire until fired upon, proof to
stand up in court etc.  Some soldier got tried and convicted for being
too trigger happy.  Soldiers don't like it over there, getting sniped
at, and not allowed to shoot back.  It is claimed that the military
know who all the IRA people are, but just can't pin anything on them
that would stick.  Your average UK person says: if you know who they
are why don't we send in the SAS and kill the bastards.
The IRA are a nuisance if for no other reason than they recently
altered UK law to remove right to silence because IRA suspects were
remaining silent, and with lack of evidence getting released.
So now, if you're silent, the judge can ask the jury to take this into
consideration (presumption of guilt, if you won't speak, you must have
something to hide).
Previously the converse was true, the judge was supposed to ensure the
jury understood that silence meant nothing.  You were obviously in
your best interests to say absolutely nothing.  As Duncan is fond of
pointing out, never say _anything_ to a policeman.  Your best tactic
was clearly not to even get involved in cross examination where you
could be made to look bad by clever lawyer even if completely
innocent, so no evidence, `no comment', `no comment' x 100, -> case

I agree.  He didn't even mention the possibility of hardware cracks,
nor estimates of times to break DES with hardware.
10,000 people burn more CPU than ever managed by a distributed effort
in history, and the PR is poorly managed.  You need to invest some of
that effort in PR.
Why no mention of the fact that the crack cost $10,000 (the prize money).
And what happened to the prize money?  (Who won it?  Did the guy
finding the key?  Or did something boring like giving it to GNU or EFF
happen to it?)
Why no source code?
Some general comments about the crack:
Many of the people involved in running the cracks seemed more
concerned with their own glory, or with getting their name in lights
to enhance their consulting rates, or the technical interest of it, or
control freakish tendencies over the management of it, arguing over
how best to design the software to conceal the key from the finder of
the key! etc, than in making a political statement about the weakness
of DES.
Seemed like few of them were cypherpunks at heart.
This reflected itself I think in the complete hostility to giving the
prize money to the winner, the fact that several of the cracks
wouldn't reveal the source code, nor their techniques.
The earlier cracks the cypherpunks as a group were involved in
(netscape breaks) were much more open (source code was released, and
benefited from release by others contributing speed-ups).  There was
none of this attitude which I detected amongst some of the DES groups
of excluding others from a small groups organisational effort, because
that group wanted the lime-light.

@_author: Adam Back 
@_subject: why we need source code (was Re: RC5 crack) 
Yes, and it's inconvenient for a number of reasons:
- those running the rc5 crack don't sign their binaries (presumably
  because they don't use PGP, or don't know what it is or something),
  who knows what you're downloading, virus, disk formatter, what ever.
  If you had source code, you could verify it yourself at least, even
  if there is no signature.
- This problem with taking too few keys, if you had the source, and they
  can't be bothered to write instructions, or even brief usage notes,
  you could at least figure out how to use it from the source
- Having source allows more people to verify it's correctness (saving
  burning keys on subtly flawed code), spot bugs, etc.  Also allows
  others to find speedups.
- The point about stopping bogus keys being submitted, some validity,
  however.
- Another reason I suspect they won't give source is that they want to
  conceal the key from you because they have other ideas about where the
  money should go than perhaps you do.  (They want $1000 for themselves,
  and will give $8000 to project Gutenburg (boring)).
- When I see people worring about concealing protocols, I get this
  urge to insert a tap between the client and server, and post the
  protocol, to remove that worry for them.

anti-crime bill 266.
Good stego encoding techniques are the difficult problem.  We could do
something in-your-face like:
use a random number, go to jail!
As a form of protest, where it really is stegoed instructions to a
remailer in a GAK-free country, which is reading the list.
Text stego is hard to do.  At ultra low encoding rates (say a few bits
per email), it would be ok.  (Just message parity, perhaps the entropy
in the message-id, posting time).
Anything more in text seems intrinsically hard to do well enough to
feel comfortable betting against a jail term.
Images and audio files are much rosier targets, but who posts volumes
of gifs, or uses audio files?  Not I, the bandwidth isn't up to it
yet, and pay-per-second phone bills don't help either.
PGP 2.x signatures (presuming we're still allowed to sign posts with
such software) don't have much scope for subliminal channels.  The
time of posting in seconds is about it.
However, PGP 3.x signatures on ElGamal/DSS keys should have.  There
are several subliminal channels in DSS signatures.  It involves
generating a random number component, and this can be exploited.
Still pretty low bandwidth.
Perhaps someone can have a go at adding this to PGP3.x, once Stale has
finished scanning the source code books, and has posted the source.
Also, I hear that PGP3.x has support for RSA keys, but won't generate
them?  Perhaps we can add that back in also.
For comfort, I'd like to be able to post, lets say 10k per day of
messages, via remailers in non-GAKed countries.  Clearly I'm going to
have to increase my rate of bit-production to stego encode this much
data in my stegotext output.  How am I going to do it with good
plausible deniability though?

One guesses it might have something to do with PGP's financial
interest to move the internet user base away from RSA keys towards El
Gamal/DSS key pairs, so that they can remove RSA backwards
compatibility from the commercial versions, if it comes to that.

(cc'd to a couple of people who's name is mentioned in second half)
Could you elaborate on these.  I caught Peter Gutmann's comments on
the hassles a company he did some work for were having with the NZ
spooks.  (The spooks intercepted their mailed disk, plus some other
cloak and dagger spookish stuff).  Is this still going on, was it ever
resolved?  Can the next version of cryptlib be exported legally?  Or
are we relying on Peters bravery?
I remember vaguely some announcments about Australia.  Has Eric said
anything on this, has anything been enforced, is it legal to export
SSLeay from down under?
Ireland is new to me.  What's their problem?  Who's exporting things
to attract spook export attention over there?  (There are quite a lot
of high tech companies over there, it's a sort of Euro silicon valley,
mostly due to tax breaks, 10% corporation tax, etc).
Btw, the UK has it's own problems also.  You can export whatever you
want in `intangible form', but to post something in a tangible form,
such as perhaps a CD (or a perl-rsa T-shirt?) you need permission from
DTI in consultation with GCHQ.  There are several forms of license you
can get depending on what GCHQ think of your product and of you
politically.  These vary between getting a license to export pretty
much anywhere except embargoed countries (Iraq, China, etc) without
further hassle, to having to ask for export permission on a case by
case basis, going down to permission for repeat exports to the same
customer.  The heuristic by which permission is handed out is nearly
impossible to extract from the beaurocrats/spooks.  (Give us
protocols, and a customer, and we'll tell you.)
I have it unofficially from the hosses mouth that if you make use of
the intangible export loophole, that it might "reduce" your chances of
getting permission to export tangibly.
I thought Ireland was similar, being based on European legislation,
though perhaps with less of an axe to grind than GCHQ, being as GCHQ
(CESG) are the authors of the euro GAK, (CASM/Cloud Cover/Royal
Holloway TTP scheme) and the TTP paper which caused a fuss last month.

@_subject: off-the-record chats with spooks (was Re: spook pressure on crypto exports) 
There is a tendency I think to be drawn into spooks, civil servants,
and polticians requests for off the record comments on how politics
really works.  (The politics of favours, the politics of spooks
wishing to intimidate people into censoring themselves to operating
according to unwritten laws (laws which don't exist, but which the
spooks wish did, and so pretend do exist)).
I think: if they said it, hold them to it.  Ignore off the cuff
requests, if they have the force of law behind them (it boils down to
a threat to kill you, or imprison you if you disagree), that they
should also get you to behave nicely and keep quiet your experience of
the way they work in practice sucks, there's too much of it in
politics in general, it belongs on a bill-board not in quiet off the
record moments after crypto-conferences.
Of course this might have the effect that spooks don't want to talk to
you, or are more careful what they say, but who cares.
Also... some clarification on the UK export situation, which I talked
about in my last post in this thread:
One concern about some of this stuff, is that often people are
representing some company when interacting with spooks, where they would be covered by an NDA with the company.  Well OK.  There are still remailers to explain the situation without giving enough detail
to identify yourself.  Sometimes there are no NDAs.
The export situation has slightly conflicting parties, the DTI (civil
servants, Dept. of Trade & Industry) and GCHQ.  DTI say you can export
intangibly, but gave a whole list of reasons why a "responsible" company
surely would not want to do anything disreputable, like have different views
of export controls from the government, here from:
: 9.  Hard to see what practical advantage there is to exporters in
: exporting technology by intangible means because they could get
: licences anyway if no concerns about the export itself.
: : 10.  And if concerns are sufficient for a licence to be refused, what
: reputable exporter would wish to export it by any means?
CESG/GCHQ seem less keen to admit the intangible export loop hole
exists, preferring to pretend it doesn't exist until pressed.
The DTI at least has contingency plans for this (from same letter):
: 4.  Government is aware of the potential for abuse of the spirit of
: export controls. If it appears HMG's export control policies are being
: undermined, then further action may have to be considered.
As I said in the previous post: the GCHQ off-the-record low down on this is
that if you export stuff intangibly (which the DTI at least will admit
reluctantly that you can do), then they will deny your tangible export
requests.  If you are a business, this might cause you to think carefully
about using the intangible export loop-hole.  Or perhaps about discussing
too much the way this works with journalists or otherwise embarrassing them. Which is of course what they want: an unwritten law which they have power to
decide as they wish.
Wouldn't it be fun if people in government/spookdom actually participated in
open discussions such as this?  (People like say Nigel Hickson, who got
roasted at the LSE crypto conference recently on the DTI/GCHQ/government
infamous TTP paper, his boss David Hendon slunk off early to avoid facing
the music during open question time). (David Hendon not to be confused with
David Henson, the ex-spook now in some governmental Euro gakkers group)
But they aren't going to participate because they operate best in
half-light, they hate harsh bright lights of open discourse.

@_subject: Comparing Cryptographic Key Sizes 
Below is a explanation of the meaning of cryptographic key sizes which
started as an explanation I wrote for a journalist friend of mine, on
being asked about how relatively secure a system using DES and RSA
(SET) was as compared to netscapes export version of SSL.
I've re-written it to make it more general in scope.
One of the most common errors I see in news stories about
cryptographic breaks is to (say) compare 1024 bit RSA keys with 56 bit
symmetric keys as if the two key sizes are directly comparable.
This new document is intended to be simple and understandable to give
people a handle on how to describe and compare cryptographic systems
This document by design glosses over some details, where I think this
is reasonable.
It could use some criticism.  If you are not that crypto aware, does
it make sense to you?  If you are crypto aware, what do you think of
my off the cuff estimates of hardness?
I wrote it with journalists in mind.  If you are a journalist and find
it useful, feel free to quote parts/all of it without attribution.
Comparing Cryptographic Key Sizes
There are two types of key sizes: public key (sometimes called
asymmetric key) and symmetric keys.  Examples of public key algorithms
are RSA, and Diffie-Hellman.  Examples of symmetric key algorithms are
RC4, DES, IDEA.  You can not directly compare public key lengths (for
example RSA keys) with symmetric key lengths (DES, RC4).  This is an
important point which confuses many people.
For example 40 bit RC4 (a symmetric key cipher) can be broken in a few
hours with a few hundred workstations.  40 bit RSA (a public key
cipher) can be broken in a fraction of a second on one PC.  RSA keys
need to be I'd guess around 350 bits to be equivalent in strength to
40 bit RC4.
56 bit DES is probably roughly similar to 512 bit RSA in hardness to
Symmetric keys sizes are easy to reason with: one more bit in key
length is twice as hard to break, for the same algorithm.  It is more
complicated estimating the hardness to break of public key (say RSA)
keys of varying sizes as they get harder more gradually than symmetric
keys.  This is why public key systems have longer keys, you need more
bits to get the same security level.
Most systems use a mixture of public and symmetric key ciphers.  This
is because public key ciphers are _slow_.  Symmetric key ciphers are
fast, and so are used in combination with public key systems to speed
up the combined system.  Public key systems are used because of the
advantages of public key management they make possible.
When considering the strength of a system using two ciphers one public
key and one symmetric key, the strength of the system is equal to the
strength of the weakest link.
For example: consider the export version of SSL, as shipped in the
export version of Netscape browsers and servers.  It uses 512 bit RSA,
and 40 bit RC4.  It is easier to crack 40 bit RC4 than it is to crack
512 bit RSA, so export SSL can be broken by breaking the 40 bit RC4
component.  Ian Goldberg recently broke a 40 bit RC5 key himself with
Berkeley univ machines in 3.5 hours.  40 bit RC4 could be broken in a
similar amount of time.
512 bits RSA is not enough either, and you can rest assured that the
NSA, other governments' secret services, and any corporation or
organised crime group with sufficient funds can break it.  512 bits is
likely within reach of a distributed internet effort, of similar or
smaller scale than the recent DES breaking.
56 bit DES is harder to break than 40 bit RC4 (SSL), from the number
bits you might think it would be 65536 times harder, but it's less
than that because DES is faster than RC4.  In software it's about 5
times faster, so that means breaking DES in software is about 10000
times harder than breaking 40 bit RC4 (as used in export SSL) in
But, if the Russian Mafia, or a corporation involved in industrial
espionage wanted to break 56 bit DES they would not do it in software.
They would build a special purpose piece of hardware which was
designed only to break DES.  DES was designed to be fast in hardware,
it is a relatively slow ciphers in software.
About 10 years ago now Michael Wiener made a design for such a DES
breaking machine.  He estimated it would cost $10,000,000 to build a
machine which would break a 56 bit DES encrypted message a few hours.
His machine was scalable, pay more money, break the key faster, pay
less take longer.  The estimate was that could build one with enough
DES key searching units to break it in a day for $1,000,000.  That was
10 years ago.  10 years is a long time in the computer industry.
Nowadays you build the machine more cheaply as chip technology has
progressed, and computers are much faster per $.  Estimates are around
$100,000 to build the machine (neglecting hardware engineers
consultancy fees).
Everyone expects that NSA, GCHQ, SCSSI have built such a machine for
$100,000+.  This is obvious because the NSA and SCSSI allow export of
56 bit DES.
$100,000 is not much money for a secret service.
Algorithms using 40 bit keys aren't secure at all, past a very
superficial casual level of protection.  Systems using DES, such as
SET are only secure against organisations who can't raise $100,000 and
can't find people who know lots about crypto and hardware design.
$100,000 is not much money for a secret service.  It's not much for
the Rusian Mafia either.

Ah yes.  Well I did read your post on coderpunks where you described
the results of asking Lenstra and looking for ideas for what to break
next, how hard 512 bits was etc.
So... 28,000 MIPs years you say... but that neglects memory.
Lenstra's conclusion was that even 512 bits couldn't be done, from
your post.  So by that measure it is harder (due to memory overhead)
than DES even though theoretically taking less MIPS with 64 mb
workstations.  Also he was unsure about the availability of a large
enough supercomputer to reduce the final matrix.
So any suggestetions of how to summarise the "hardness" of a problem
when it includes memory and cpu costs in as simple terms as possible.
(Bearing in mind the reader in most cases hasn't grasped the
difference between public key crypto and symmetric key, and is
comparing 1024 bit keys to 56 bit keys and probably thinks that it is

So's SSE (subsidiary of Siemens-Nixdorf).  But that's mostly/all

Ireland allows intangible export, no permission required, same as UK.
They do say they would like a list of customers after the fact, but
that's just would like, not you are required to give or else.
(Clearly it would be a bit difficult to list the customers off your

For tangible exports you need permission, much as in the UK.  I get
the impression that the `open for business' attitude (love that 10%
corporate tax break, is systemics getting this?) would mean you'd get
an easier time than in the UK.  They promise fast efficient turn
around on export applications.  (Unlike NZ MFAT, reread Peter

35 hours sounds a reasonable amount of time to break a Swift banking

Who says it hasn't been done?  It's not as if the banks would be keen
to advertise this.
You remember a while back some Russians (including one "mathematician"
according to news reports) had succeeded in fleecing a US bank of
several mil and routing the money to various banks around the world.
Until they got caught.  The news reports said the US bank(s) wanted to
talk to him to find out how he did it.  I was always curious as to
what that Russian did to crack bank security.  I conjecture that it is
possible that he built a wiener machine, and that the bank hushed up
the story.  (And switched to 3DES post haste:-)
Also re. $100k = price of a ferrari and there are plenty of mobsters
around with that kind of money, that price was 1993 price.  Maybe at
1997 prices $100k would get you down to a few hours again.  How small
are the moving windows?
Re. the "profit model" there were several possibilities discussed
around the time the DES crack was starting, before Peter Trei
persuaded RSA to make a challenge.  One was a european ATM card which
had a master DES key, and this was part of some standardisation thing
(each bank had it's own DES key, plus all participating banks allowed
this master key).  But it's not much fun making profit off ATM
machines -- they have cameras in them, and the cash you can draw on
one card in a 24hr period isn't that much.  You'd have to produce
hundreds of faked cards, and have a whole host of accomplices running
around emptying cash machines.  Tricky logistics, many participants ->
increased chance of getting caught.  Not that easy to cash in on.
One factor that hasn't really been discussed much is the possibility
of amortizing cost.  You build the DES breaking machine, and if you
use it to break 1000 DES keys, that's $1k per key.  Starting to open
up even lower end applications with good organisation.
I'm sure there were a couple of things discussed where there were some
interbank transfers which relied on DES.  Moving window means you've
got to break the keys fast, as you say.  Also I wonder how easy it is
to siphon the money and make it disappear with all the auditing.  (aka
may be you could invest 1 mil and build a fast key breaker, transfer
lots of money, but so what if the audit trail points fairly and
squarely at you?  Cash the money quick and buy unconditional
immunity in Belzize?)

approx as hard, is it 100x harder.  They don't want to hear about

memory trade offs (DES).  If we don't supply the gross generalisation,
they will do it themselves to make it palatable for their readers.
With less understanding of the subject, their generalisation is likely
to be even wildly inaccurate than the generous error bars on ours.

@_subject: intro to public key crypto (was Re: Comparing Cryptographic Key Sizes) 
Jason William RENNIE They have very different properties.  Public key systems have really
nifty key management properties.
With symmetric key crypto (as ever) things are simple and intuitive.
You have some data, you have a key, and you can scramble the data with
the key, you get out gibberish.  Some jargon, the three parts are
called: your data = plaintext, scrambled gibberish you get out is
called ciphertext, and the key is the cryptographic key which enables
to be decrypted (de-scrambled, turned back into plaintext, that you
can read again).  To unscramble the data you'll need the key again.
If you send the message to someone, that someone also has to know the
Big problem: how do you get the key to them?
Phone them up?  (Painful).  If you can contact them securely why
bother with crypto in the first place.  Just tell them what it is you
want to tell them over the phone.  (Not that phones are secure, of
Then Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman invented the first practical
public key crypto system (1976).  With public key systems you have two
keys.  One is called the public key, you give this to everyone.  The
other is the private (or secret) key which you tell no-one.
Anything encrypted with the public key can be decrypted with the
secret key.  As you can tell anyone the public key you can list it in
a directory service much like you list your phone number in the phone
book.  PGP keyservers are examples of such electronic directories of
public keys.
Now anyone who wants to send you a message just gets your public key
(from you, or from a keyserver), encrypts it to you, and sends you the
encrypted message.  So now a perfect stranger half way around the
world can encrypt a message to you, safe in the knowledge that no-one
but you can read it, not even the NSA.
Everything is beautiful and rosy.  (Well everyone except the NSA, who
thinks everything has gone all dark and horrid, 'cause they used to
have fun reading all our comms, but it's too late anyway, because we

Schneier (the quote you give) gives this table (some values omitted):
# of bits		MIPS-years required to factor
512 bits		3*10^4
1024 bits		3*10^11
1536 bits		3*10^16
2048 bits		3*10^20
How are you extrapolating that to 4096 bits?  Hardness to break
increases as a superpolynomial function of the key size.  The memory
requirements increase with key sizes, also, which I don't think these
figures are taking into account.
If someone would like to post the big O notation for GNFS space and
time complexity, plus current estimates of the constants, perhaps we
could improve upon that.
I reckon my estimate is conservative, if hardness relates to cost,
rather than mathematical number of operations ignoring memory

Reasoning was following on from Eric Murrays:
: how much further than completely free crypto can you go?
Most of the lobbyists as far as I can make out are talking in terms of
privacy from government, right to free speech.
Not in terms of eroding government power, avoiding taxes, making governments obsolete, nor in terms of hostility towards the legitimacy of government, it's methods etc.
So you might argue that this would make the privacy lobyists seem more
middle of the road.  However crypto is binary, either it's free, or
it's GAKked, so they (the privacy lobbyists) can't disavow crypto
anarchy, because it's a consequence of the technology and legal frame
work they want for privacy.  There's nothing in between.
My conclusion was that the crypto anarchy conclusions are pretty much in line with some of the NSAs scare stories and their spin is being used as an argument for GAK.

@_subject: breaking RSA in hardware (was Re: Comparing Cryptographic Key Sizes II) 
Remarkably close to my original figure :-) (same as DES I said, you
estimate DES to be 475,000 MIPS).  So, even though GNFS is faster, if
we don't have the hardware, it'll be better to use QS because using
GNFS whilst continually paging will be even worse.
With DES software is not at all an efficient way to break DES,
compared to a Wiener machine.  Unfortunately the press releases have
had very little to say about the true cost of breaking DES with
hardware.  Perhaps it would be interesting to look at the economics of a well
funded attacker breaking a 512 bit RSA key.  If we asume that they
would do it in software, and had to buy the machines, would you be
better to buy fewer workstations with 128Mb or lots with 16Mb.  Factor
of 17 speed up using GNFS acording to your estimates of DES, and
Lenstra's for GNFS RSA.
So perhaps we're looking at motherboard $100, cpu $100, PSU+case $100
+ 16Mb RAM $100 = $400.  The same, but with 128Mb $1100.
So that's a 1100 / 400 = 2.75 ratio.  Clearly buying the larger memory
PCs is the way to go.
Overall GNFS is 6x cheaper it would appear.
However, really the interesting question is how much would it cost to
break RSA in hardware.  How expensive would it be to build a custom
hardware machine to break RSA.  What building blocks would be needed.
How much memory.  What would be the most efficient approach.
Would it be cost effective to use NTTs RSA chip?  What would be the
most efficient way to distribute the memory.

@_subject: repudiable signatures (was Re: Digital Signatures & THE LAW???) 
Not a complete solution, but one technical fix, if you're sending
e-mail to an individual, rather than a post to a group such as this is
to use repudiable signatures.
These work by ensuring that the recipient and only the recipient can
forge the signature.  As the recipient can forge the signature it
falls back to his word against yours, which is the situation without
signatures.  However he (the recipient) will be convinced that you
wrote the signed document, or at least as convinced as he is that
someone else hasn't covertly obtained a copy of his private key.
If you're using a repudiable signature, it won't hold up in court, or
at least it shouldn't, if you can get the jury to grok that.
Personally I can't see any reason for individuals not to use
repudiable signatures for email.  Email is generally regarded as
private, and to give someone a signed email allows them to not only
post your email which you may not want, but to undeniably prove that
you wrote it!
Mathematically an easy way to create deniable signatures with RSA is:
Alice sending Bob a signed email.  We want:
Alice chooses random Y, and computes X:
Now the repudiable digital signature is X and Y.
To verify the signature the recipient checks that:
Repudation is possible because Bob could also produce that same
signature with knowledge of B_pri, for Bob X is a random number, and Y
is calculated:
(In practice you would have to store X and Y in random order,
otherwise if the sender always comes first, it's no longer repudiable.
As a result to check the signature you may have to swap X and Y if the
signature fails first time).

Yeah, but we can always just release a patch for windows which makes

there is room for different competing patched key signature services:
sign anything, sign only CAPI modules which don't involve GAK (key
escrow), sign modules for which source code has been examined and
provide a degree of assurance that the module is secure.  Charges
could be made for the CAPI rating, to the module provider, and to the

@_subject: "why privacy" revisited 
Well things aren't standing still.  Absent continual watchfulness,
political lobying, and cypherpunkery (writing freeware crypto code,
and providing privacy memes), privacy is taking a huge negative hit.
You requested an argument couched market economic terms as to why
reduced privacy might be a bad idea for the market efficiency.
Less privacy is a bad thing in market economics terms, because as
privacy takes a downwards spiral, which leads to ever increasing
government intervention, increasing sizes of governments, fascism,
etc. the free market economy will go to hell.  Poverty, and food
shortages will result, a la the former USSR, which is slowly
recovering from the decline caused by statist, facist policies.  We on
the other hand, absent pressure from outside government, law
enforcement and secret services circles are collectively headed into
that fascist driven downward spiral.in economics.
Wide-spread strong privacy tends to support a freer economy, and
reduced government overhead.
Presumably the increased market efficiency you refer to as obtainable
by reducing privacy refers to the loss of direct marketing
opportunities for commercial advertisers.  I'm not sure that this
(putative) gain in the market efficiency would be significant compared
to the huge efficiency gains to be made from dismantling or reducing
Is it not pro-competition, and supportive of a free market to have
privacy preserving technology widely used?  Then commercial
advertisers who wish to target groups of potential purchasers of their
wares, can pay the purchasers for the information.  (The information
belongs to the individual, so it seems fair that a commercial entity
should have to pay for it.)  Examples would be store loyalty cards
which offer discounts, or points, and in return obtain customer
spending patterns.  If sharper commercial interests choose to buy the
users spending patterns at reduced rates by preserving their privacy
using non-crossreferenceable Chaumian credentials, well more power to
them.  The market can decide.  This is a market based solution.

@_subject: UK to ban free use of crypto? 
I think that the paper implies in several places that TTPs, if they
offer a CA service for public encryption keys, will also be required
to hold the private keys, and to hand the private keys over to the
government on demand.
This Q&A is not contradictory with this interpretation.
When they say that the TTP will not be able to decrypt the message,
what they mean is that it would be able to decrypt the message if the
message were given to it, but that that's not the way the GAK
architecture works.
What happens is they first obtain a authorisation for a wire tap, then
obtain copies of your email.  Then they go to the central access point
and ask for your private key.  Then *they* decrypt your email.  `The
TTP will not be able to access an encrypted message' in the sense that
they won't give it the message to decrypt.
This is bypassing the intent of the key-escrow/GAK functionality of a
TTP.  There is a section which discusses this, and makes it a design
criteria that users not be able to by pass the GAK function, whilst
making use of the signature certification function.  Personally, I'm
not sure that this is possible, as there a whole host of ways around
it.  (Use the signature key in the way you suggest, superencrypt,
subliminal channels, stego, etc).
This is the point which I think should be pushed: the only commercial
need for CKE (_commerical_ key escrow) is for _stored_ data.  Do you
see any corporations crying out to open their communications for
industrial espionage by DISSI, NSA, GCHQ, etc.?
I think there are several sections which imply that the TTP must keep
private encryption keys for any public encryption keys it holds (and
that it must allow government access to them).  There are many places
where the presumption is made that the TTP has the key to release to

Best argument I've seen for ombudsman key-escrow yet.  And
yet... surely it would be perfectly feasible to have the commercial
key escrow key system set up with the n of m directors and company
lawyer holding the key?  If they get suspicious they can check on
someone, and the rest of the time, no one can read anyone else's
In any case, if you were able to find an example of a company who
wanted this unusual setup, could they not draw up a contract with a
legal firm, or computer security company to achieve something similar.
The real problem I have with the DTI document is in `facilitating
ecommerce' or whatever the euphamism is for the government bid to have
real time access to user keys, they are also outlawing use of
unlicensed TTPs.  From the document it seems that activities which
require a TTP license are key server functionality, CAs (even for only
signature keys), time-stamping services, plus numerous other
possibilities, by entities which are not licensed TTPs.
Then they go on to say they want the market to decide on whether
government licensed TTPs are the best solution.  After outlawing most
other possibilities, and putting legal obstacles in the way of a fast
moving technological field.
A lot of the proposal discusses outlawing non-licensed alternatives,
and timeliness of GAK (government access to keys), surely the way is
already clear for encryption companies to offer what they hell they
want to offer, to companies who are free to demand what they want.
How do you describe all the `key recovery', and restrictions on TTPs
being interoperable and joining the network if they don't provide GAK?
Sounds _exactly_ like a clipper job to me.
I'm sure this is the plan.  CESG is trying to push the CASM
architecture for TTPs (CASM is based of the Royal Holloway proposal).
CESG already has some `customers' who are legally obliged to use their
recommendations: central government.  The Health service had to put up
much resistance to avoid `the offer you can't refuse' of using Red
Pike in Health Service networks.  (Why Red Pike anyway?  It's a secret
algorithm, which is rumoured to be a modification of RC5, which itself
is a very new and relatively untested cipher.  What's wrong with 3DES?)
They plan to work their way out through peripheral government agencies
and authorities through the requirement to communicate with central
government, and the tendency to go with the government standard and
then move on to the public through the services the DTI is discussing
providing to the public.  Offering the public the opportunity to
interact electronically with both local and central government.
Along with legislation to make digital signatures binding in law only
when signed by keys held in a TTP licensed key server, certified by a
TTP licensed CA, they probably figure they can achieve de-facto
status, while quietly outlawing enough functionality to make
competition possible.  (For example running a non-TTP licensed
commercial CA or key servers would be a criminal offense.)
That's their game plan as I understand it.

@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] hash cash postage implementation 
A partial hash collision based postage scheme
I've been talking about a partial hash collision based postage scheme
on the crypto lists for the last few days. The idea of using partial
hashes is that they can be made arbitrarily expensive to compute (by
choosing the desired number of bits of collision), and yet can be
verified instantly.
A first cut implementation of these ideas can be fetched from here:
   * hashcash.tgz
   * PGP signature of hashcash.tgz
I will describe what the implementation allows by example, using the program
so you can follow along if you wish.
There is an integrated partial hash collision generator (hashcash mint) and
remailer plug-in. The remailer plug-in should be easy to hook into typeI
remailers. typeII or nymserver would require modifying the mixmaster
client/remailer, the code has been designed to make this relatively easy to
do, and link directly into mixmaster, or alpha or newnym.
        % gcc -O6 -c *.c
        % gcc -o hashcash hashcash.o sha1.o
        % gcc -o sha1 sha1file.o sha1.o
        % gcc -o sha1test sha1test.o sha1.o
        %
The functions provided by the program are
Run with no arguments and it prints a list of flags and terse usage
Speed test:
        % hashcash -t
        speed: 7218 hashes per sec
        %
This tells you the number of hashes it can search per second. (Note, the
implementation of sha1 it is using is not optimised, it is my reference
implementation. I have another speed freak sha1 implementation which needs
1/2 hrs work, and has the same interface, so I'll plug it in later. It's
commented in sha1.c).
Estimate time required to find 17-bit partial hash collision:
        % hashcash -t -17
        speed: 7274 hashes per sec
        find: 17 bit partial sha1 collision
        estimate: 9 seconds
        %
(varies quite widely from estimated time)
Calculate a 17 bit collision on string "flame"
(flame is a now dead remailer):
        % hashcash -17 flame
        speed: 7274 hashes per sec
        find: 17 bit partial sha1 collision
        collision: 09948flame356018443
        tries: 57450
        %
The collision is actually found on the hash of the date since Jan 1 1970 in
days (5 digit leading zero filled) and string given.
So the collision is found on:
        % echo -n 09948flame | sha1
        fbbea210abafe3e72afe7849eaea2052e309e017
        %
The collision that was found can be seen manually as the collision is
constrained to be the MSbits of the digest:
        % echo -n 09948flame356018443 | sha1
        fbbead76da651cf856f7466fed9624d3ada061d9
        %
You can manually see that the first 20 bits match. (Note we asked for a 17
bit hash, but it generates a 17 bit or larger hash. We just got lucky and
got an extra 3 bits, which would happen about 1 time in 8).
The hashcash client can also report on a collision:
        % hashcash flame 09948flame356018443
        collision: 20 bits
        %
You can check on the validity period as compared to todays date:
        % hashcash flame 09948flame356018443 28
        validity: 28 days remaining
        collision: 20 bits
        %
You can check that a hash has a requested number of bits:
        % hashcash -25 flame 09948flame356018443
        collision: 20 bits
        required: 25 bits
        rejected: too few bits
        %
The exit status is set to failure if any of the tests fail: ie if there are
too few bits, or if you do a validity check and the hash has expired, or
isn't yet in it's validity period.
Double spending protection
You can also ask the hashcash client to remember collisions within a
selected validity period.
        % hashcash -d -25 flame 09948flame356018443 28
        validity: 28 days remaining
        collision: 20 bits
        required: 20 bits
        database: not double spent
        adding: 28 09948flame356018443
        %
The collision will only be added if all the tests pass (in validity period,
required number of bits). The exit status also tells you if the hash was ok.
The database would grow indefinately as the mailer accepted new payments, so
the validity period is stored in the database, and at the next use of the
database after the validity period expires, the collision will be discarded.
There is no need to keep expired collisions around because we wouldn't
accetp it anyway because it's out of date, so who cares if we've previously
accepted it. A validity period of 0 means valid forever, and it will never
be discarded from the database.
An example of double spending
A new test now is whether a hash has been presented before, so we the above
command and expect it to be rejected as already spent, because it is in the
        % hashcash -d -25 flame 09948flame356018443 28
        validity: 28 days remaining
        collision: 20 bits
        required: 25 bits
        rejected: too few bits
        database: double spent
        %
(exit status is set to failure, due to double spent cash)
That's it
It's very lightly tested, so if anything breaks let me know.
It's got some inefficiencies in places, but working code comes first,
efficiency later.
(Also I have not tested my SHA1 implementation on a big endian machine, it
auto-detects byte endian-ness, theoretically).
Remailer applications discussed so far
   * exit remailer postage per post
   * spam filter on mail you receive, if it hasn't got a 20 bit hash, or 1c
     digicash you have a program which bounces it with a notice explaining
     the required postage, and where to obtain software from. This would put
     spammers out of business overnight, as 1,000,000 x 20 = 100 MIP years
     which is going to be more compute than they've got, and 1,000,000 x 1c
     = $10,000 is going to be more than they are likely to make through
     sales interest from the spam.
   * good behaviour bond for nymserver users. The nymserver user pays the
     nymserver (in a largish hash collision, or $25 digicash) for a
     replyable nymserver account. They agree an contract with the penalty
     clause that breaking the contract means the nymserver keeps the
     digicash/collision, and disables the account. They user's identity
     isn't known, but to join in again they have to pay up another large
     hash collision or more digicash.
   * there are lots of other ideas to play with.
How does this fit in with digicash
Digicash postage on remailers, and mail would be useful, however there are a
number of problems with digicash:
   * It is more onerous to set up an account (form filling etc)
   * Not many people have accounts
   * It's only anonymous for the payer anonymous (and not anonymous for the
     seller)
So my suggestion is that we have remailers which accept either hash
collision postage, or digicash postage. The advantages of this approach are:
   * Hashcash may provide a stop gap measure until digicash becomes more
     widely used
   * Hashcash is free, all you've got to do is burn some cycles on your PC.
     It is in keeping with net culture of free discourse, where the
     financially challenged can duke it out with millionaires, retired
     government officials, etc on equal terms.
   * Hashcash may provide us with a fall back method for controling spam if
     digicash goes sour (gets outlawed or required to escrow user
     identities).
Any comments, code, etc gratefully received.  A couple of remailers
alpha testing it would be nice also.

@_subject: remailer spam throttle 
Here's a partial solution to that: in the ping email informing the
recipient there is mail waiting, you include a key, encrypt the
message body that you are retaining data with the key and then discard
the key.  Give a deadline: "your message will be deleted in 5 days".
They re-supply the key when they request the message.  You immediately
decrypt and send it back to them, discarding all knowledge of them
(email, encrypted message, encryption key).
One snag is that you still have addresses for recipients on your
machine so they can go harass people and ask them for the keys to the
as yet uncollected messages.
Refinement to solution (I like this one), get rid of the intended
recipients address immediately after sending the ping, just keep the
encrypted body of the message.  Include in the ping something which
reliably selects a message (say first encrypted line, SHA1 hash of
encrypted message, whatever, to save you having to try to decrypt all
of your messages).
This sounds a lot like the distributed block and accept list idea
which has been discussed a bit.
I like your treatment of the remailed material as a `hot potato',
instantly pass it on or burn it.
The per remailer block list system kind of does this at the moment,
only the list of people initially marked down as willing to accept
anon email is the world.
Everyone can recieve email, but people get blocked when they complain.
Incidentally, it has occurred to me for a while now that the reverse
problem also exists: if I suspect you (Dimitri) use remailers, I can
forge a message from you to all the remailer operators requesting that
I (ie you) be blocked.  I can include some exceedingly dire legal
threats to the remailer operator, and dig up some vile messages from
some dark corner of usenet which I falsely claim came through that
operators remailer.  As the remailer operator doesn't keep logs he
won't be able to recognize the falsehood of the accusation.
To solve this problem you need to do a ping message, "please reply
with this nonce to be blocked".

@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] hash cash postage implementation 
It is interesting that you should reference Dan Berstein's sci.crypt
post of a couple of days ago, as his post is what started me thinking
about using partial hash collisions as an anti-spam postage system
which preserves anonymity.  Also Rivest and Shamir have a system which
I was aware of called "MicroMint" which makes more complex use of
k-way hash collisions as the basis for a complete micro-payment
system.  Hal Finney described their system in outline a few days ago
on cypherpunks, and pointed out the similarity.
For remailers and spam control, the requirement is for a function
which is expensive to compute, but easy to verify.  The partial hash
collision satisfies this and can be arbitrarily expensive (1/100
second to 100s of MIPs years), and yet can be verified instantly.  The
hashcash proposal uses this function as the basis of a decentralised
approach to reduce abuse of non-metered internet resources.  There are no banks, brokers or any other legally targetable entities
which will get shutdown, or coerced into adding identity escrow if
used for postage in anonymous communication.  As a result of this, the
recipient (an anonymous remailer, or private user) of the cash gains
no value which can be converted into other currencies, but rather the
assurance that the sender has spent more computing resources preparing
the message than he will in processing the mail request.
I'm fairly sure that Dan Bernstein was talking about a birthday
attack, as he was referring to the fact that he had used some
technique to keep the storage requirement down, and suggested that
those who claimed birthday attacks required high storage where wrong.
I think he was found an arbitrary 2-way collision.
Arbitrary in the sense that you don't care where the bits that collide
are in the hash outputs.
And 2-way in the sense that you are trying to find a hash collision of
any message texts (you don't care what), ie in:
you are trying to find an M and N such that the bits of X and Y are
the same in n bit locations for an n-bit collision.
If you accept arbitrary collisions it makes the job easier (few of the
arbitrary collisions you find will have thier bits in your chosen
location if you specify restrictions on acceptable locations for the
colliding bits).
Hashcash does not accept arbitrary collisions, the only collisions
considered accepted by the client must be in the n MSbits.
Hashcash is trying to find a collision to a specific string, so it
does not involve the storage complexities of finding birthday attacks,
or the methods of finding them with lower storage requirments traded
for higher overhead.
Specifically, the hashcash client it is trying to find an n-MSbit
collision on the hash of M:
The client looks for collisions on texts of the form:
So, it's algorithm in finding hash collisions is incredibly simple:
The hash collision postage is M' = day | resource-name | counter.
And there is no easier way to find collisions if the hash function H
is one way and collision resistant, as the output bits can for these
purposes be treated as individual random variables having value 0 or 1
with 50% probability.  It is basically like tossing n coins in a row
seeing if the coins are all equal to your chosen set of outputs (head
= 0, tail = 1).
Funcion H in the hashcash implementation is SHA1.  The actual hash
used in effect is the short hash formed by discarding the remaining
160 - n bits of the 160 bit SHA1 output.
The hashcash client includes the "day" which is the days since 1 Jan
1970 to allow validity periods to be determined by acceptors of ecash,
or expiry dates for services charged for in hashcash.
The main purpose of the day field being hashed in is to allow the
hashcash acceptor to limit the size of his double spending database.
The purpose of the "resource-name" is to ensure that cash can not be
double spent by spending at different remailers, or different email
recipients.  The resource has a name (the email address, short
remailer name, whatever), and anyone who chooses a non-unique name
opens themselves up to double spending.  So the cash is recipient
You could if you wished use the hashcash client to implement a
centralised double spending database, and provide online verification
so that service providers can check for double spending.
This gives the advantage that the user can create some collisions
without having to decide on who to spend them on in advance.
For email I don't think it's worth it because the main intention is to
force the spammer to bear higher computer resource overheads than the
innocent by-standers (remailers, and recipients of unsolicited mass

I think you don't need to keep Bob .. just lookup K with L.  Less
email addresses is a good thing.
The counter argument I suppose is that the Feds, or anyone else who
reads Bobs email can then ask for the key.  But if they can read his
email, they can already read it once he requests the key.  It would
allow an eavesdropper to do a DoS attack against Bob, request all his
emails before he can.
Why is this a problem?  You have accept lists for remailers between
themselves.  A private remailer (one not advertising itself on these
lists) just mimics Alice in retreiving the email ... waits a while
then requests the key.
You can provide a web interface to do it for him.
Or, you can offer the option that if he includes the encrypted message
in his request you will decrypt it for him, by return of email.
Don't keep the addresses as above -- treat the nonce L as the
Random pool like PGP, it's one way and the pool has more bits than the
key material the Feds have anyway.  /dev/urandom is nice.  Yes.  A good solution also.  Perhaps we can write a nice remailer
which has a web forms interface for configuration, lots of radio
buttons etc to allow the proud new remailer in a box owner to
configure his remailer, and pretty stats graphs.

btw if you're interested to fix the keyserver so that it requires an
ack to a ping with a nonce, someone at MIT has a fast PGP key database
link to it from Brian LaMachia's keyserver page.
Another snazzy thing to do to the keyserver would be to have it obtain
a timestamp signature on your key (from a third party time stamping
service, of which there are several) and include that too.

The Bcc approach avoids this problem as you don't see the Cc's, so

I've also had negative experiences of cross posting, (I did it to

I don't either.  My only interest in posting to these lists at all is
that some people hang out there who don't read cypherpunks.  I got a

that comes to cypherpunks first, or exclusively to cypherpunks until a
3rd party forwards it the better, as this adds to cypherpunks
reputation, and increases the value of and interest in the list.
My attitude is leaning this way also.  I post most things to

@_subject: SAFE Bill discussion 
Those arguing in favour the SAFE bill claim it will make encryption
freely exportable.  They also claim that as a result of this we will
see encryption in mass market software.  Both are clearly attractive.
The SAFE bill also makes it a crime to use crypto in furtherance of a
crime (sentence += 5 years?).
The two in combination are problematic:
If microsoft products mostly include crypto which is turned on by
default, then everyone is using crypto.  So if one is unlucky enough
to be singled out for government harrassment for whatever "crime",
it's just a blanket law which allows the sentence to be increased by 5
years for nearly everyone in a few years.
In 10 to 20 years time your car, your mobile phone, your television,
your telephone, your brief-case, probably your toaster will have
crypto in it (your mobile phone and sat decoder already do).
Adding criminalization of use in furtherance of a crime is STUPID.
Mobile phones are a good example, they include crypto (at least GSM
does, even if it is naff, and only the link to the base station).  Say
the government designates you as a "criminal", and you use a mobile
phone, surely this is using crypto to further a crime?  It will make
it more difficult for the Feds to tap your line, right?  Especially if
you are using stolen phone ID cards.  Mobile phones are getting
cheaper, and more widespread.
It's similar to imposing restrictions on other technologies in their
early stages, say:
  "use of automobiles in furtherance of a crime will add 5 years to your
   sentence."
  "use of the new telephone service will add 5 years to your sentence"
I hope that the coalition of lobbying groups are not supporting SAFE
if this criminalization clause is there.
If you're going to support it at all, support it on the CONDITION that
this is removed.
However, messing with politicians is a dangerous hobby, read the fine
print real carefully, or you may very well actually be unwittingly
helping the enemy.

I'm not sure that this is so.
Ascii pic. consider Alice and Bob, without crowds:
        +----------+
 Internet |
        +----------+
 2Mbits
          +-----+
 ISP |

      +---+     +---+
 A |     | B |
      +---+     +---+
When Alice and Bob are online, consider that they are actually using
their bandwidth most of the time.  I know I do; if I'm not using it I
hang up, with pay per second phone lines, you're likely to.
Now add in crowds where traffic from A is going through B, and traffic
from B is going through A:
                           +----------+
 Internet |
                           +----------+

                          +---+     +---+
Now Bob and Alice each have 1/2 the bandwidth they had before.  Add
more users and longer hops and it gets worse.  Of course my claim that
Alice uses 100% of her bandwidth is probably an exaggeration.  There
will be idle times while she is reading.  However there will be times
when both Alice and Bob are downloading, for multiple users with
multiple hops it is likley that there will be more than one user
actively downloading at any time.
I'm sure it's going to increase the latency too.  My ping times are
200ms from the PPP link alone (ie pinging the PPP server machine
itself).  Add to this that the members of the jondo / crowds pool may
not be on the same ISP, and you've got the additional overheads of
whatever latency is added by the cumulative latency between each of
the hops in the chain.
This compromise is probably retains a fair amount of anonymity.  The
ISP probably isn't loggin IP traffic, or incoming or outgoing web
proxy (jondo/crowds) traffic, and probably isn't actively attacking
your jondo process to see which bits are for you and which are being
I wonder if you could improve the security of this by trading off
against some additional bandwidth consumption for the ISP.  Say have
split the jondo in half, with two cooperating half-Jondos acting as a
single virtual jondo in such a way that someone with root access on
one machine but not the other, can't extract any useful information by
spying on that half of the jondo.
Crowds migh scale in this way, but DC nets and Pipenets don't.  Crowds
is a weaker cousin of DC nets and Pipenets.

You're not suggesting that SET offers anonymity are you?  Anyway, I'm not against this initial approach necessarily.  Once
you've got one non-anonymous electronic payment system with low entry
costs to obtaining both a merchant and a purchaser, and is widely
accepted, you can boot strap an anonymous payment system off it.
The net model is that it should be that a merchant and a customer
account are the same, and can be had by filling in a web page in real

Will SET and Cybercash make it easier to be a merchant than it is to
be a VISA merchant?  Becoming a credit card merchant is a rather
onerous expensive, slow process I hear.
You lost me there.  Above you described the trustee's function as
holding the ability to issue money to keep the bank honest.  What _is_
a bearer certificate in this discussion?  A digitally signed share
certificate, or other representation of an unit of value?
Who issues the bearer certificates?  What does possesion of the bearer
certificate represent in terms of ownership of assetts?
Actually it's micromint which has the threshold function feature
through use of k-way hashes, my hash cash is quite simple, and
probably impractical to use as a basis for a currency you wished to
connect to a real currency.  There is a cost of printing hashcash
coins, which can be made high (say a weeks CPU for a P100), but
basically anyone can mint all the money they have CPU power for.  This
is interesting for throttling systematic abuse of limited net
resources, and combining with a digicash system you could have
transferability as well as anonymity.  However the stability of the
money supply is probably not up to it.  It's kind of like allowing
anyone to print money, but making it cost them in time only; the
resources they already have.
You think you can create a digital bearer certificate market on the
back of your architecture of issuers, and trustees.  I don't see a
great difference between this and a traditional bank.  How is it going
to reduce the per transaction overhead, and how is it in any way
distributed.  (I presume your term "geodisic" refers to a distributed
value transfer system).
What is an ACH transaction?  A electronic bank clearing protocol?
FSTC is Financial Securities Trading... electronic checks?
Isn't this going to be just another electronic check, with full
transaction log, and associated overhead, banking regulations giving
banks enough effective monopoly to charge high handling fees?  I don't
find electronic checks that interesting.
What we want is fully anonymous, ultra low transaction cost,
transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going (and obviously
there are some people trying DigiCash, and a couple of others), the
banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.  I
think this would be a good outcome, and I'd rather see this happen
than see anyone go to any great effort to get the banks involved.  Let
them stick to electronic "cash" systems (what a misuse of the word)
based on credit cards and checks.  See how that survives against
_real_ distributed electronic cash with transaction costs 10 to 100
times lower, with 0 red tape barriers to entry for both sellers and
buyers.  This is what I find interesting.
The net is becoming more and more important as an mechanism for
information exchange in it's own right.  This is why I think just
cutting the ties with the physical world and having a payment system
working now would be interesting.  Deployment wins and all that.
Hashcash is completely distributed; there is NO bank.  You can not
forge hash cash, you can not double spend hash cash.  You can print as
much hashcash as you have CPU time for.  You can resell hashcash for
real money on an unoffical exchange, or trade hashcash for different
I don't see any particular inherent reason why an electronic payment
protocol can't be designed which requires no trust of the bank; at
least it should be possible to arrange it so that the bank minting
funds for it's own use will be detected.  All you need is that the
protocol is publically verifiable.  Digicash already prevents double
spending through the database of protocoins.

@_subject: chained stego & interfaces to remailers 
(Skip down to "Chained Stego" if this intro is obvious for you)
Some users are in countries where crypto is illegal, and would still
like the ability to communicate with others on topics which are
considered illegal in their countries (an example being documenting
civil rights abuses).
For them using encryption is not an option unless they combine with
Also in countries where using crypto is legal, people still would like
to have the ability to discuss topics which are considered illegal in
their country (an example exporting cryptographic code, perhaps)
For these users they do have the option of using encryption.  However
for some serious users of crypto, they may wish to hide the fact that
they are sending encrypted communications to anyone at all, as well as
hiding _who_ they are communicating with via mixmaster remailers, and
hiding the contents of their communications via the use of encryption.
Using remailers and using encryption shows up under traffic analysis
even in freer countries, and if you were using steganography, you
would be above suspicion, apparently never having sent an encrypted
message at all, or at least not having sent one during the time in
A useful capability to address the needs of these classes of users
would be to be able to send messages to a remailer by
steganographically encoding them in publically published material,
Examples being: messages posted to USENET, messages posted to mailing
lists, material made available on web pages (text, images, audio
files), CUSeeMe video streams, etc.
Such a system would allow a person in a country where crypto is
outlawed to participate anonymously in discussions in the remaining
free parts of the world without appearing to be using cryptography.
The simple approach is to set up stego to remailer gateways which scan
newsgroups and mailing lists.  (It might be a useful to integrate this
function into the Eternity server, as it is already doing quite a bit
of scanning of newsgroups, and scanning newsgroups is relatively
expensive, so we may as well scan for multiple message types while we
are scanning).
So, to send an anonymous message, a person PGP encrypts their message,
and manipulates the encrypted message to remove the statistical
properties identifying it as a PGP message (by removing
"-----BEGIN..." headers, the fixed PGP formatting inside that, and the
bias caused by the use of RSA), PGP stealth version 2.x would be
suitable for this purpose.
Next a suitable steganographic encoding is required.  A simple method
would be perhaps an in-your-face approach, to include a randomly
distributed, randomly changing .sig:
Use a random number, go to jail, so lock me up already.
The stego remailer gateway has to be able to put back together the
multiple parts in the correct sequence.  The Date: field from the post
would be enough information to allow this.
Chained Stego
However there is another problem: the remailer gateway knows the
identity of the stego users.  The stego users therefore have to trust
the stego gateway not to tell the authorities in their country.  They
also have to trust that the gateway is not actually be run by their
own countries censorship board.  The price for misplacing trust and
revealing your use of encryption may be death in some of these
It would be nice if we could chain the stego function, so that the
amount of trust required of each element could be reduced, in a
similar way to chaining through remailers acheives this.
So (here we get to the actual content of this post, the above having
been introduction), we could arrange that the stego user encrypts with
a selection of stego gateways public keys.  The steps to send to
gateways A and then B are:
1. encrypt with B's public key, normalise output (with pgp stealth)
2. encrypt with A's public key, normalise output
3. encode normalised output from 2 into an innocuous looking USENET post
The process by which the stego message is recovered is then more
complex, and has higher overhead.  Each stego gateway has to scan
newsgroups for stego messages, and forward it's potential partially
decrypted stego messages to the other stego gateways.  Then each of
those remailers decrypts, and if the result is more stego noise, again
forward back to the other stego gateways.  The problem here is when do
we stop!  Remember if we pick a message, and apply our stego decoding
method to it we get something which looks indistinguishable to a stego
message whether there exists a stego message or not.
Also how much of USENET do we scan?  The stego gateways will be
sending a lot of partially decrypted potential stego messages between
One potential solution to the infinite loop problem is to include with
the message a note to the gateway stating how many times this has been
decrypted.  After a few hops it can be discarded.  If the max hops is
2, and there are 3 gateways A, B and C.  The messages created by the
single encrypted message are:
round 1: A, B, and C decrypt and forward to each other
round 2: B, and C decrypt
     C discards the output;      B forwards the message to the requested remailer
(We presume that multiply encoding to the same remailer is not useful,
if A can decode by denormalising and decrypting twice, you may just as
well have addressed it to A normalised and encrypted once).  B does not know which person's USENET post this came from.  He does
not know where it is going (to another USENET group via a chain of
remailers, or to an indivdual)
However B does know that remailer A knows who the message is from.
Presume there are n remailers.  For hops which go through h remailers,
collusion is required by all h remailers to obtain the identity of the
poster.  If the attacker owns k of those remailers, that is k of the
remailers are colluding to discover the identity of the stego user,
then the if k < h the attacker will never discover the identity of any
posters using chains of length h.
If k >= h the attacker will discover the identity of a stego user only
in cases where the chain includes all of the hops. (C(n,k) is choose k
of n function computed with n!/((n-k)!k!)
Prob = C(k,h)/C(n,h) =  --------

message, so if you chose different gateway chains on each message your
cumulative chance of being caught would be worse than if you just
chose a chain and stuck to it.
You're trying to minimise your cumulative chance of being identified.
If you use a chain, and the jack boots don't kick down your door for a
few weeks, you hope it is a good chain.
Of course there is a chance that gateways could be taken over and your
chain would then become a compromised chain.  An additional danger if a gateway is compromised and it's key is
revealed, the attacker can then go back through it's saved messages
and look for messages which came from the newly acquired gateway, or
went to it, to see how many more chains this compromises.  It would
seem like a good idea for the gateways to ensure forward secrecy by
re-keying reasonably frequently.
To do better than this, we could make the stego gateways to act like
middlemen remailers.  That is a gateway will always communicate with
other gateways via a remailer.  Now gateway B does not know which of
gateways A or C decoded the message from the newsgroup.  So he has to
attack them all.
Better still, the gateways can be completely hidden.  They can use a
message pool to communicate.  This has higher overhead, but now the
fact that gateway B knows either A or C decoded the message does not
help much because gateway B can't physically locate A and C.
An alternative to the suggestion of including a count of the number of
decryptions that have taken place so far to avoid infinite loops, is
to do the job probablistically.
Say that each remailer says that it will only accept mesages where the
low order 3 bits after decryption are "101".  This rule doesn't apply
to the first hop, which knows that the message hasn't circulated
anyway, as it has just pulled it from the newsgroup.  So the first
gateway decodes, forwards to the other gateways.  Each gateway
decodes, and if the desired bit pattern comes out, sends the decrypted
message to the other remailers.
This way we place no restriction on the number of hops, avoid
revealing who the first hop is explicitly, but ensure that the
messages which are not stego at all die naturally, and don't propogate
for ever between the gateways.
Also the "101" is likely enough to come up quite by chance, and the
number of actual stego messages is small compared to just ordinary
USENET posts that seeing a "101" doesn't prove anything conclusive
after 1 hop.  However after several hops (if an attacker owns several
of the gateways), the probability of getting multiple "101"s in a row
points increasingly to a stego message, whereas if we relied on a
header stating how many hops, no information would be leaked by the
attacker handling multiple hops in the middle of the chain.
So it's a trade off between lower overall overhead whilst allowing
multiple hops, whilst increasing the susceptability of the system to
leaked information to an attacker who owns multiple rogue gateways.
However these are all very high overhead because they have DC net like
overheads, you send a copy to everything to everyone always, so you
have a perfect mix.
You can trade off this security to obtain lower bandwidth.  Here's one
suggestion of how to do this.  Obviously we can't include with each
partial decryption instructions on who to remail it to (because if you
found some instructions, that would reveal immediately that it was a
stego message).  However, we can interpret the random bit patterns as
remailer instructions.  Say there are n gateways, we can number the
gateways consecutively and take the decrypted message mod n - 1 to
produce the index number of a gateway to send to next.  We can include
a count of decryptions so far to reduce overhead.
Another way to avoid infinite loops with this variation is to take the
decrypted message mod ((n - 1) + j), anything over n-1 gets discarded.
Messages naturally die out statistically at a speed determined by the
ratio of j / n - 1, after h hops there is probability:
that the message will get discarded.
Provided the stego users account for a small amount of traffic, their
use would likley be lost in the large pool of noise even if they stuck
to a particular chain.
Or they could themselves use normally distributed selections
of random chains.  However if they did this, their cumulative chance
of sending through only rogue gateways on one post would increase.
Interestingly this setup has different properties to mixmaster mixes,
with this arrangement traffic analysis gives you nothing, as the
inputs are hidden, and the traffic is perfectly normally distributed.
(Presuming that the stego users create random chains also).  Cover
traffic between gateways adds nothing.
You probably need cover traffic on output however, so that the
gateways send constant, or at least evenly distributed amounts of
traffic off into the remailer net, so that one persons posting can not
be correlated with exits from the gateway network.
Some delay in the gateway network would help also.  Random delay is
different to mixing in this instance because there is already lots of
mixing going on, the point is to ensure that an exit from the gateway
network is not observable at fixed time periods after posts from
particular suspected stego users.  If there are many users this should
average out.
Note also, that when a message does decode to a message, the gateway
should generate a random replacement message and forward that to a
random remailer with the same probability as for other non-decoding
messages, otherwise receiving a message would skew the statistics.
Given that the stego user has an interest in sticking to a chain, this
is less secure than sending copies of partially decrypted potential
messages to all gateways.  Either he doesn't stick to his chain, thus
increasing his odds of being detected, or he uses his fixed chain and
runs the risk that this statistic shows through.  If there are many
stego users each with different fixed randonly chosen chains, the fact
that chains are fixed would be less likely to reveal information as
the random chains would tend to cancel out, and themselves have the
same normal distribution as the non-stego traffic.
More efficient ways to get around the weakness of a single remailer
gateway hop?

You can't just average it though and get a true picture.  It will

You metioned browsing in flurries.  If your flurry coincided with

You'll notice this stuff when you're browsing the web and it will be
annoying as hell!  Your actual available bandwidth will fluctuate

bandwidth consumption.

Later versions of eternity perhaps can set up pipenets between
eternity servers and exchange cache contents, charge to keep data in
caches, and so form their own anonymous distributed database rather
than relying on news archives.  If you set up a pipenet between the
servers you could do something similar to what you describe below with

feeding into the large bandwidth jondo pipenet.  The flurrys would be
impossible to correlate with users.  To avoid placing all trust with
one jondo, you'd need bi-directional anonymous WEB traffic within the
jondo net with multiple layers of encryption, so that jondos don't
know where the data is going beyond the immediate hop.
You know we could do this if we were willing to pay for the bandwidth.

I don't think so.
PGP has been standardising on El Gamal which is not covered by RSA's

litigious patent worker.  El Gamal is a variant of Diffie-Hellman, and
the patents on Diffie-Hellman are set to expire RSN (later this year,
There is still the putative claim by RSA that they have a blanket
patent covering `any public key system', but it sounds like they are
not relying on this claim here.

to a `for backwards compatibility only' feature.  This suit will maybe
accelerate this move away from RSA, and perhaps costs backwards

Functionally: it provides both a digital signature method and an
assymetric encryption method.  They are not self-inverses as in RSA
(in RSA encrypt with secret key = signature, encrypt with public key =
assymetric encrypt; with El Gamal encrypt and sign are different
operations).  Security: EG is based on the discrete log problem (being a variant of
Diffie-Hellman) where as RSA is based on the factoring problem.
Discrete log has about the same security for the same size keys.  El
Gamal encrypted blocks and signatures are twice the size as RSA
blocks, there is a 2x expansion.
If you don't mine a common prime modulus with EG, key generation
is fast (just generate a random number), RSA key generation is _slow_.
There is no separate patent on EG.  The D-H patent, which the patent
holders may argue covers EG, expires as I said RSN so the attraction
of EG is that it will then be unencumbered by patents.
El Gamal was developed by Taher El Gamal.
I don't see the advantage of EG encryption, D-H achieves the same
thing with the same security and it doesn't have message expansion.
There is a difference, with D-H you can't choose the session key
directly, it is negotiated and depends on the encryptors choice of
negotiation parameter and the recipients secret key.  However most
uses of public key encryption are only interested in exchanging or
negotating a symmetric key anyway, so D-H seems practical for this
purpose.  Is there any speed advantage with EG encryption?
EG signatures and D-H encryption?  You can share the prime modulus
public key parameter.
I don't know, no one's exported the source to pgp3.0 in electronic
form, and I haven't seen the books either.  PGP4.5 (which has been exported, was on ftp://ftp.replay.com last I
looked) seems to use RSA still.  It has the added functionality of a
windows front end, separate signing and encryption keys, and expiry
dates on keys.

@_subject: key recovery vs data backup 
It seems to me that it is you Kent who is scrambling to find plausible
reasons why key escrow is the best or only technology to use in
corporate email systems.
Ah I see you do acknowledge what Carl Ellison and Matt Blaze have been
saying on cryptography at c2, that key escrow has complexity problems,
contrary to what you have previously been arguing :-)
I don't see the difference.  With the encrypt to multiple recipients
approach where the second crypto-recipient is the company key you can
store the private half of the corporate key using the same techniques
you discussed above.
Access to the data requires access to the master key in both cases.
You fix the second crypto-recipient in the MUA if you wish to.  The
fire-wall can reject posts without the second crypto-recipient.  You
can use binding cryptography to ensure the fire-wall can tell that it
is an encrypted copy of the same document without the firewall needing
access to the master key.  You can't do this company has all keys in
the safe model, without givin the firewall automatic access to the
safe, which is a huge security risk.
So, I suppose you would argue that oh no, the user can by pass this
feature of the MUA, they can use a different MUA, or telnet to the
SMTP port manually.
Well, you know, people can bypass keys which are stored in the company
safe also: don't use them!
They can also walk out of the building with a floppy, store info in
their heads, or use any number of subliminal channels that abound in
crypto and internet protocols.
The advantage of the multiple recipient model is that doesn't commit
the cardinal sin/design flaw of sharing private crypto keys.
Some people have argued that multiple recipient is less suited to GAK,
and therefore it would be better to use multiple recipient, I'm not
sure that it makes that much difference.  If we get forced to put the
government as the second crypto-recipient recipient, the government
still gets to read all your mail.
The main argument against company generates all keys, company holds
all keys, to me is that it's bad crypto design.
The `it's easier to explain a safe full of all employee keys' to
management argument is nonsense also.  It's a master key either way
and just as easy to explain either way: a master key is a key that
lets you decrypt all mail.

Firstly: have you done a comprehensive survey of corporate access
systems available to commerce.
Secondly: there are a number of other forces "encouraging" the GAK

get given research funding to experiment with GAK/TTP architectures.
Either the architecture is stipulated as part of the call for

Third: people involved with key recovery at all have tended to be
defense contractor types, who are more likely to go with government
"standards" (such as TTPs/clipper/tessera/etc).
I was under the impression that PGP Inc had done it, or is working on
it.  It's not very hard at all, all you need is PGP's existing
multiple crypto-recipient feature.
The storage of your company master key needs some thought, but that's
a common problem with either your crypto key safe model or multiple
recipient model.
I have a memory.  I recall you made several posts where-in you said
you were against GAK.  Your line of argument seems to be that the rest
of us are misguided, or are allowing are dislike of GAK to cloud our
judgement on what a good crypto architecture GAK would be applied to
corporate key escrow.  Right?
I have no doubts as to your intelligence.  I understand what you are
trying to explain, and understood the first time you tried to explain;
I just disagree!  If you want to discuss your motives, the thing that
puzzles me is that your tone, overall apparent statist tendencies, and
zest on this topic are at odds with your stance on GAK.  Did you ever
come across a guy called David Sternlight?  (Clearly an intelligent
guy, but having a tendency to hang on to arguments, and stir up flame
wars, in his case I'm sure this was intentional.)  Not equating you to
Sternlight, though there are some similarities in style.
Perhaps it is just that some of us reacted negatively when you first
bought this topic up, and you are still acting in retaliatorily
hostile manner as a result of this.  Remember it was you who called
for rational calm discussion.  People impute from your apparent
statist leanings, and your arguments against people who are against
the key-safe model because of the possibility of helping build a GAK
infrastructure that you are pro-GAK.  Perhaps you need to disclaim
this more clearly.
If I believed GAK architecture was superior to multiple-recipient, and
was arguing this I don't think I'd come across in the same way.
I'm not sure that multiple recipient is that much less useful to GAK
than the safe model, buf if it is at all less useful, and the systems
otherwise basically equivalent I would argue against the safe model
for that reason alone.  However I consider the safe model inferior in
several areas neglecting this issue anyway.
I contend that there are similar and mostly comparable problems with
the safe model.  Lets take a look at a few:
Kent says give all the keys to Acme corp, or let Acme corp generate
the keys.  Who is Acme Corp?
The next bit is as a result of multiple recipient being more flexible
than the safe model as stated.  We now have freedom to allow different
elements in the company to audit and access different departments
communications.  Naturally this extra flexibility results in policy
If making policy decisions is too complex in your view for
implementation or practicality, well just substitute a policy dumbed
down to the level of the safe model.  Ie there is one crypto
recipient, all company communications _must_ be encrytped to it as a
second crypto recipient.
Policy distribution is something Netscape has been doing; apparently
the difference between it's browsers is largely a signed policy file
with a mildly obfuscated public verification key check in the code.
I'm sure you can arrange this same flexibility and bring in the
baggage of the policy decisions that come with it for the safe model
also if you want it.  Store keys for different departments in
different safes.  Give the master keys for the department to the
department head, etc.,etc.  Same problem, similar policy decisions,
As stated above, this is because you have chosen a single master key
to go with the safe model.  If you choose a single crypto-recipient,
and master key encrypting the private half of that key, you largely
have equivalence.
Or similarly insecure.  They are quite similar, I think multiple
recipient offers more flexibility, and security advantages, as well as
avoiding the sharing of private keys.
Sign the policy file.  Certify the signing key(s).  You're going to
have this anway for authentication of email content.
Sign it too.
It does for the same functionality.  With the key-safe model how do
you know that the ciphertexts flowing out of the building are
encrypted with a key that is in your safe at all?
You don't have to do the binding cryptography stuff with multiple
recipients if you don't want to.  With the safe model you can't do it
even if you do want to.
For storage encryption keys where backups are not plaintext, I agree.
For communication keys, you do not need to backup.  Doing so weakens
security.  Communications keys should be transient, forward secret
even.  Authentication keys should be persistent, back up not required,
just generate new key, and new certificates if lost.  Storage keys
should be backed up where necessary.
With the safe model, to allow access to outgoing mail, you'll have to
encrypt to a company key as second crypto-recipient, or to yourself,
thereby allowing company access through access to your key.  Quite
similar to multiple recipient.  Similar explanation.

One of the main considerations in the design of my eternity server was
the idea that there was information which might get published via
remailers, but would be unlikely to get published on a web page
directly.  Eternity translates the ability of publishing via a
remailer into the ability to publish on the web.
An example is perhaps the NSA handbook, or Mykotronix dumpster diving
results.  These sorts of things tend to arrive via remailer, and then
get mirrored afterwards.
There will also be some class of documents which are too hot to mirror
at all, or where the censor is litigious enough (Scientologists?) to
present a real danger to it's ciritics, and to mirrorers of the
A question then is could a censor systematically block all eternity
search engines effectively.  I think this would be relatively easy,
the design does not really attempt to deal with site blocking
The URL always includes "eternity" so is easy to block.  You could
perhaps provide an option for a public key encrypted URL.  Or lookup
by the SHA1 of the URL directly.  An SSL session would also help, the
cgi-binary accepts both post and get methods.  However ultimately, the
eternity servers will be advertised, and so the censors just need to
keep track and block all the advertised servers.
However there is another option: all the data is available in USENET
anyway, so anyone can run an eternity search engine for their own use
in a shell account.  To block this is more difficult.
Use stego solves this (as Bill Frantz observed).  Do a web search on
`texto', it's a nice simple text stego program.
Another interesting fact is that they can't block the traffic unless
they have decrypted it.  As the data can be encrypted with the SHA1 of
the URL, they won't necessarily recognize it as an eternity web page
until it gets accessed or the URL advertised, by which time it is too
late.  The URL can be smuggled in and passed around more readily.
WEB mirroring is useful where the data being mirrored is illegal in
someone else's country and you are trying to stay one step ahead of
the censor.
Eternity means you can publish material which is illegal or
dangerous/unpopular to publish in your own country.  Sounds like something that could be addressed by building on the
rotating mirror idea William Geiger has been talking about.  Perhaps
you could have an apache module which provided a proxy service which
allows encrypted and steganographically encoded URL passed to it, and
encrypted, stego web pages passed back.  Combine with some unstego
method on the receiving end, and lots of people using apache with this
option turned on, and the censor would have one heck of a problem on
their hands.

individual server operators would be less liable than if they part of
the distributed database as is the case with Ross's Eternity Service.
There are specific exemptions for caches in some legislation (I
think), and anyway you can turn cacheing off.  Search engines have
similarly to my knowledge been left out of the censorship argument.
The interesting aspect is how censors would react when they bumped
into documents hosted by this system.  By basing it on USENET, the
hope is to direct censorship attempts at USENET itself, which has
proven very resilient to attack.  (Cancel messages I'll discuss in my
response to Paul Bradley, who raised this question).
One aspect of my system which has not been implemented yet is fetching
articles from news archival and search services such as dejanews and
altavista.  This would be useful to reduce the bandwidth overhead of
having to re-post pages just to keep up with
I tried a few experiments to see if this was feasible, and discovered
a few things which will affect the design.  The design requires lookup
by SHA1 hash of virtual URL.  Firstly neither search engine will search for hex numbers over a
certain length.  The search engines have some indexing mechanism, I
presume they have a rejection criteria to remove mime strings etc
clogging up the word index, it specifically rejects long hex strings,
I'm not sure what the cut-off is.  Both seem to search for decimal
numbers of somewhat longer length.  Neither will search decimal
numbers of sufficient length to represent a SHA1 hash directly.  The
solution to this seems to be to encode as space separated groups of
sufficiently short numbers and use a search AND to find them.
Secondly (!) one of them explicitly states that they do not archive
uuencoded data.  However it does archive PGP mime'd data (currently),
perhaps to allow for PGP signatures, or perhaps uuencode alone was
targetted as the most common by volume.
The PGP data archiving would likely change if the eternity posts
volume got significant enough to draw the attention of the news
If/when this came about, something like texto (primitive textual stego
program available on the net somewhere) would probably be sufficient
to fool the search engine.  (Bill Frantz suggested stego for this
purpose in a recent purpose).
Paul Bradley provided some critisisms, and someone else in email,
which I'll respond to next.

Many 1000s of people have exported it.  See also Vince Cate's arms
trafficker page.
Around 3000 T-shirts were sold also.  Guess there are a fair number of
people practicing civil disobedience in the US as a result.  They're
still selling, see:
for order info.
While it's probably technically illegal to export, it clearly doesn't
get you in trouble to export it.  Raph Levien sent off a Commodity
Jurisdiction Request together with a sample T-shirt to ask permission
to export the T-shirt under the ITAR regulations.  They did not answer
his request.  I presume that they viewed either a "yes" or a "no" as a
loose for them.  If they say no, they open themselves for mockery in
the press, if they say yes, we progress the situation.  Export on
paper?  Floppy?  Internet?  Bigger programs.
I'd guess the request is now outdated by the token change in export
regulations (in reality mostly a name change) to EAR regulations which
transferred jurisdiction to the commerce department.  It might be
interesting to ask them for permission to export it.  If anyone wants
to do this, I'll supply a sample T-shirt :-)
Looks like the laws may make another token name change again, but
remain the same again, with a SAFE, doubtless with key-escrow bolted
on during the compromise with NSA and LE interests stage of
I'd always hoped that someone could make a good PR job of ridiculing
the export regulations with this.  So far it never really got much
further than the NSA/ODTC ignoring the CJR request of Raphs.  Also,
Duncan Frissell caused a bit of a stir at CFP a few years back with
the program on labels which he handed to attenders.  Vince Cate had a
bit of success also.  The shirts have been on French TV, which is
significant also due to French crypto regulations which are worse than
the US regulations.
A while back I did a cgi binary which exported the PGP.EXE out of
pgp262i in uuencoded parts, 3 lines at a time.  Came out at 713 parts.
Maybe that would be more symbolic.  People weren't so keen to export
that as they were to export the perl rsa sig.
When I announced the url, people posted "I got no 7, who got the 1st
part?" etc.  See:
Of course this wasn't my idea, it had been discussed on the list
several times before, I just took advantage of my position outside the
crypto curtain to actually do it.
It's a bit out of date - it's talking about ITAR, that should be EAR
I think this has been established.  Vince Cate's exporters page sends
president at whitehouse.gov a protest letter together with the rsa sig.
There is a log of exporters.  Lots of names on it.
I think Vince says on his pages that he got a mention on CNN of his
arms trafficker page.  I'd encourage anyone to use the sig, or
t-shirts, mailing labels or the guy with the tattoo of the .sig to
cause all the embarrasment they can for the US government.
Well, it does seem to me at times that people in the US are being too
timid about the whole situation.  I mean if everyone just openly
ignored the stupid laws, you might think they would go away by
default, just to catch up with reality.  Much hand-wringing is spent putting no-export warnings on code,
obfuscating the download process to discourage non-US people, and
warning others not to export.
Clearly for the individual there are few ill-effects from exporting
the 3 lines of perl.  (Actually 2 lines now see below).  Probably
nothing much would happen if you personally just uuencoded PGP and
spammed USENET with it.  I mean it would make not one iota of
difference as it's already universally available on ftp sites and web
Phil Zimmermann and Kelly Goen were hassled over their export, but
it's too late to worry about PGP now.

One issue with the system is that censors will issue cancel messages
for the articles.  Not too much which can be done about this.  Some
trends tend to help this problem:
Cancel message abuse by people running cancel bots reflecting their
censorous views have resulted in some sites ignoring cancel messages.
PGPmoose provides a better method of allowing only the author to
cancel.  Or NoCEM provides a ratings system framework, which is
superior to using cancels.
Another aspect of the system is that it relies on news archival
services such as dejanews and altavista; these presumably don't listen
to cancel messages for already archived data (? guessing here).  The
archive maintainers presumably don't want to get involved in disputes
over which old articles should be purged from their archive anyway.

Not entirely.
If other people use your remailer also, and you have latency, they'll
see n messages going into your remailer, and n come out.  There will
be log2(n) entropy added, they won't know which of those are from you
and which from the other users.
Flooding attacks might make the situation worse, say you wonder if all
of the messages apart from your own are from the attackers, and that
the purpose of these messages is to flush your message out of the

This is interesting.
It seems that this set up provides a potential test case similar to
Phil Karn's one with the source code disks for Applied Cryptography,
only much smaller, and much more silly looking, which I think would be
a boon because the US government would have more difficulty defending
the ban on export of something which would take 30 seconds to type in.
The response to Phil's request to export the disks detailed that there
was significant value added in the text having been OCRed/typed in and
neatly arranged in files on a floppy.
The .sig is also a few seconds to scan with a bar code reader.  Bar
codes are also interesting in this context, they are machine readable,
and the 2D bar codes allow reasonable information density on a sheet
of A4.  Vince has a 2D barcode gif of the .sig on his Arms Trafficker
If the perl rsa .sig were to be given permission to be exported in
electronic form, over the years since the original RSA sig I have
accumulated a collection of programs some donated by others, and a
couple more myself.  There is a good selection: IDEA, OTP, RC4, RC5,
DES, Diffie-Hellman.  Someone did an RSA keygen a while back.  These
vary in size and usefullness.  It would be relatively easy to create
something sufficiently functional and yet dangerous in a reasonably
few lines.  Full PGP compatible encrypt, signature check, and decrypt
looks doable in under 2000 chars or so, easily 1 A4 page of text, or
2D barcode.
That would be cool if accurate :-)

Seems your cancel bot has been a net boon to freedom of speech,
encouraging cancel message abuse which in turn leads to the natural
solution of removing the ability to cancel other peoples articles.
Perhaps your intention :-)
Perhaps a content aware version would improve on your content blind
one, making it easy for censorous persons to make more of a nuisance
of themselves without having to have enough of a clue to figure it out
for themselves.  Perhaps a slick windows interface is in order :-)
Select your prejudices from this pick list.  Just to help accelerate
the move away from honoring cancel requests.
Does this imply that you are aware of precedents where the search
engines maintainers have removed articles on email requests after the
article was initially posting without X-No-Archive: yes?  Or were you
just refering to the X-No-Archive mechanism?
A bad precedent to act on instructions of someone purporting to be the
author requesting deletion.  Opens the way for someone to socially
engineer deletion of articles they wish to censor if this is so.  Also
opens the way for the author to be coerced into removing the article.
As an aside I think X-No-Archive is a stupid idea.  If you don't want
a post released for anyone to save for later reading, don't post it.
If you are concerned about the correlation of your net posts with your
physical identity, post using a remailer, or nymserver.
In fact I'd encourage anyone with the hardware to spare to offer an
X-No-Archive ignoring search engine.  Move it off-shore if you get
hassled.  Perhaps an X-No-Archive: yes only archive would be the best
way.  (ie only archive stuff which is specifically marked as not for
archive, that should give pretty low bandwidth requirements and make
the point).

The downloader by definition is restricted by his own national laws
not by US laws.  US attempted world policeman attitude does not mean
that US laws apply outside the US, particularly not to non-US citizens
outside the US.
(Yeah, I know tell that to Noriega, but that was simple kidnap).
(The UK has recently introduced a few laws which they claim apply to
UK nationals outside when resident outside UK also... bad trend.)
The counter argument is that say Iraq says that you must not show
pictures of women's faces.  Do you similarly honour Iraqs request to
extradite the news media in the US?
Extradition treaties to my understanding tend rely on the crime being
a crime in both countries.  For illegality of exporting crypto code on
the Internet the US is largely on it's own.  And anyway, I'm
_importing_ crypto, you're exporting it, or at least allowing me to
import it.  There are even fewer examples of import restrictions than
of export restrictions.
Personally I would feel no compunction in downloading anything I
choose from any US site on the basis of US laws; they do not apply to
However out of politeness to the operators of the US archives I would
generally not recommend this for the simple reason that it might get
the archive operator in trouble.  This is my only consideration.

@_subject: LSE UK crypto politics conference 
I went to the conference in London on Monday organised by PI (Privacy
Intl.) and GILC (Global Internet Liberty Campaign.)  Speakers were
DTI representatives, Whit Diffie, Phil Zimmermann, Ross Anderson, Carl
Ellison, IBM UK representative, a few people from LSE (London School
of Economics, who hosted the conference).
I don't take notes, but here's a list of points I considered
interesting.  If you want details on any issues I can give more detail
as required.  If anyone else reading went and did take notes they
might be able to attribute quotes a little more accurately.  I
understand there's supposed to be an audio transcript on the web
 might be a good place to look.
Government Presentation of proposal
1) David Hendon and Nigel Hickson from DTI presented the DTIs arguments.
They argued that this is a green paper only, the government has
changed, the document was partly the views of the previous government
and partly the views of the DTI.  This I viewed as an attempt to
deflect criticisms, as they could not specify what has changed, and
were not planning to change the document.  (The new government have
not looked at the issue at all).  The labour party had a much more
reasonable policy they published before they got in power; but it
remains to be seen whether they will stick to this or whether the
CESG/GCHQ will lobby them to adopt GAK/TTPs etc., which are in the
CESGs interests.
They claimed to not want to escrow signature keys, but only to escrow
encryption keys.  (The wording in the document clearly states that
they wish to escrow all keys as a condition of being a TTP).  They
said they had many comments on this issue.  (Clearly the only use for
escrowing signature keys is to allow forgeries.  Why would the
government want to forge messages from citizens?  To provide law
enforcement access they only need access to private encryption keys.)
The DTI said much of licensing requirements for TTPs were modelled
after banking regulations.
Architectural and Technical
2) Ross Anderson gave the example of the health service's experience
with CESG/GCHQ foisting flawed cryptography solution CASM on it
(complete with key escrow and secret algorithm Red Pike).  The BMA
(British Medical Assoc), and even DoH (Dept of Health) rejected this
`offer'.  Ross is a computer security advisor to the BMA.  He also
debunked many of the lies spread by GAK proponents, and gave a potted
history of the behind the scenes GAK activities in the UK and Europe.
He also said that CASM was now the laughing stock of Europe in the
crypto community, and that in response the CESG had allocated a new
project manager and given CASM a cosmetic name change to CLOUD COVER.
3) Whit Diffie argued about the importance of privacy in the
information society.  Explained how PK crypto removed the previous
problems with centralised key distribution services.
4) Phil Zimmermann gave his usual talk about the ethical case for free
use of crypto.  Civil rights workers, resistance fighters against
governments with poor civil rights records, etc.  Also made the point
that the backdoor into crypto the DTI appeared to be pushing would
allow the current government to abuse it's power to stay in
Legal and Commercial
5) Peter Sommer, LSE made some points on legal topics digital signature
legislation, etc.
6) Carl Ellison, Cybercash argued against the centralised trust model,
and against X509.  Arguing instead for distributed trust models
particulary Rivest's SDSI and his own work on distributed trust.  Carl
argued that trust should represent permissions, and be administered by
the interested parties.  (eg your bank gives you a key with permission
to draw money from your bank account, not some government licensed
7) IBM (in the form of Peter Dare, IBM UK) sold out to GAK.  Peter
Dare's presentation started with a list of things he liked about the
DTI proposal, then a few minor criticisms (very respectfully put), and
as a punchline to his talk presenting IBM GAKware (forget the product
name) and his talk finished with a sales pitch for this product.  At
the end of which Whit Diffie shouted out from the audience can Carl
Ellison have equal time for a cybercash sales pitch!
8) John Dryden representing the OECD gave a presentation of the OECD
guidelines.  (T-shirt and jeans odd the rest of the government and
business types wore suits.)  He explained the guidelines as a
significant relaxation.  The guideline referring to key escrow was
changed to a `may' escrow keys rather than a `should' escrow keys.
Said most of the time spent during the OECD SOGIS discussions was
spent arguing about key escrow.  He considered the guidelines a
significant step forward.  The guidelines are non-binding
recommendations.  He said 28 countries signed up, which should
indicate that their countries representatives found the guidelines
consistent with national laws.
9) Alistair Kelman, visiting position at LSE
Made the point (as several others had) that a general principle should
be that trust should mirror existing user trust relationships.  People
do not trust government, nor the sort of large organisations the DTI
is clearly envisaging as suitable TTPs.  He argued that GPs (General
Practitioners, family doctors) would be suitable candidates as trusted
members of the local community.  Kelman also seemed to be arguing that
keys should handed to the user, and not generated by the user.  I
queried him about this afterwards, as it is clearly a bad security
model, and he said he considered it a usability issue, generating keys
being too difficult for the user.  I don't agree, the usability is a
matter to be solved by good software, not by centralising key
Civil Rights and Privacy
10) Simon Davies, PI argued that case for commonality of interests
between business and privacy issues.
11) David Banisar, EPIC talked about the history of the US clipper
series, and raised the topic of digital telephony bill (where the
government requested access to first 1% and then reduced simultaneous
Following up from this someone from the floor claimed that the
telephone networks are tappable without the phone company (BT, British
Telecom's) cooperation.  Indeed the person making this claim (who
claimed comprehensive experience and knowledge of phone routing
hardware) said that BT would not even be aware that the tap had taken
place.  Several others in the audience confirmed this was the case.
Whit Diffie said that he had not heard this claim, and that it was not
the case to his knowledge in the US.  The person making the claim said
that he knew the switches used in the US were the same (and quoted the
switch model), and so he didn't see why not.  The question was raised
as to why digital telephony was necessary at all with this type of
phone switch being used in the US.
Law Enforcement
12) The guy from NCIS (National Criminal Intelligence Service) didn't
turn up because he had to go to hospital due to an eye problem.  The
chair, Prof Ian Angell, LSE suggested this might have been due to
looking through too many keyholes :-)
Panel and Open Discussion
Panel: Carl Ellison, legal advisor to GLIC (forget name), Nigel
Hickson DTI, someone from TIS (?) who spoke too quitely.  Chair was
Caspar Bowden, Scientists for Labour.
Most of the panel session consisted of arguments directed at the DTI
and questions for Nigel Hickson representing the DTI.  Hickson had
made jokes about the hostility he was expecting.  He appeared quite
competent at avoiding answering questions directly where this suited
Each panelist was given the opportunity to summarise their position.
Nigel Hickson claimed the main motivation for the proposal was to
encourage user and business confidence in digital signatures for
business purposes, and thereby to promote electronic commerce.  He
used this as justification for the banning of un-licensed TTPs.
Several comments from the floor that it would be better to let the
market decide, and to allow unlicensed certification authorities, key
servers etc to continue unmolested, and in competition with GAKked
government licensed services.
Hickson also claimed key escrow was a small part of their
consideration.  (I'm sure it's true that this is the part they wish to
downplay as this is the part which causes the majority of resistance.)
The question was raised as to whether the DTI understood that the TTP
system could be trivially bypassed by the criminals it was supposedly
designed to catch.  An example given was that anyone wishing to bypass
could use the sigature key helpfully certified by the TTP to
authenticate non escrowed keys they generated outside the TTP system.
The point that there were many other subliminal channels was raised
also.  Nigel Hickson acknowledged this, but said in defence that some
criminals are stupid, that criminals must talk to non-criminals.
Someone put it to Hickson "What is the worst thing that could possibly
happen if the government did nothing?"  ie what if the government
didn't legislate anything, ie why doesn't the government get the fuck
out of the way so that business can get on with commerce unimpeded.
Several business people put it to the DTI that they didn't need any
`help', and that the regulations had held up electronic commerce for
too long already.
Several people argued that business is most interested in
authentication, and not in confidentiality.  So for business purposes
(which what after all the DTI claim is the main reason for the paper,
and the DTI being after all the `Department of Trade and Industry' and
having a mandate to further the interests of UK businesses), they
could achieve what they wanted without bringing escrow into the
argument at all, as they have acknowledged that they will now not be
requiring copies of secret part of signature keys.
People argued against the high cost of becoming a TTP.  The point was
raised that it should be SME (Small to Medium-sized Enterprises) which
are encouraged in electronic commerce.  Also that many internet
innovations start as small or even one man consultancies.
Several asked whether the paper should be re-written as a result of
comments before being presented to the new government, as the comments
if listened to would remove most of the current content.  Also the
question was asked as to whether the deadline for comments could be
extended beyond end of May.  No substantive answer was given to either
of these two questions.
My conclusions
The DTI didn't really clarify their position much, most of the
contentious stuff (mandatory licensing, key escrow, financial barriers
to becoming a TTP) there were no substantive replies to from the DTI,
other than that they were collating the comments.  They said they
would present the Labour science minister/labour government with the
green paper unmodified together with the comments.  (And one presumes
a few spooks from GCHQ/CESG will get the opportunity to present the
four horsemen/spook special interest perspective).  The only clear
statement I noticed the DTI spokespersons make was that they wouldn't
hold the private halves of signature keys.
On the positive side, the labour statement on encryption prior to
coming to office was no where near as draconian as the DTI paper.
Anyway, we'll see.

the privacy considerations.
I'm not sure how anonymous Attila is in total.  He made a comment on
this with regard to Black Unicorn's anonymity a short while back.  I'm not
sure he's trying to hide his identity to that great a degree beyond
using a nick name that some folks gave him years back.  There are
several things which would help you track details down... he has
regularly discussed his local mormon community, the location in which
he lives, and his own domain "hun.org", his position within the local
mormon church, his big bore 'bike, physical appearance (300lb gorilla
I think is his own description), nationality, qualifications, military
service details, etc.  A whois on hun.org would likely get you his
phone number, or someone who would know his phone number.  His
primenet account would probably similarly get you info.  Unless he
uses aliases in real life also, and unless the details he has given us
over the years are not true.  (I haven't met him, though I think

Attila an example of someone with lots to say when hiding behind
strong anonymity.

@_subject: Distributing cryptographic code 
I was arguing that US laws do not apply to me living outside the US.
The US courts/government may claim otherwise but this does not alter
that fact.
Where international agreements have been agreed the laws become part
of the legal framework of the agreeing countries.
Extradition is another method, but people normally only get extradited
from their own country if they commit a crime against a citizen of the
extraditing country.
And finally kidnap, the fact that this is an extra-legal process does
not bother the US.  (In fact they even declare it legal if they
consider it appropriate, as I understand it.)
For the sake of argument if I were detained at a US airport, or
kidnapped and taken to the US, and further was found to be "guilty" as
defined by US law, I would not be guilty, and I would hope that my
country would attempt to intervene.
The reality of all this is strained however because, a) they wouldn't
extradite someone, nor kidnap them for this, b) they wouldn't detain
me if I entered the US (I did last year with no ill effects), c) I am
having difficulty imagining what it is they could legitimately charge
me with, even by US standards of legitmacy with regard to crypto
export.  I attempted to _import_ a piece of software into the UK, no
crime there.
I suspect it would be dodgy shooting at military aircraft in Canada
also.  In the UK, and most of EU (with the exclusion of France), we
can export electronically (on the web etc) to our hearts content.  The
situation with tangible exports, at least in the UK, is different.  I
understand you need a license to export tangibly.  I was unaware of
this at the time I started exporing T-shirts, but I'm aware of it now,
and have no particular intention of ceasing to export T-shirts.  If
they want to do something about it and make a media spectacle of
themselves, they're most welcome to try :-)
Actually I took a couple of my munitions T-shirts with me when I went
to the US last year, and bought them back out with me.  I was wearing
one of them (under another garment) through the airport as I left.
Again if the US would like to try something, the next time I'm there
they are welcome to try.
Unfortunately perhaps it appears, at least according to Peter Junger
that the T-shirts are probably OK now under the EAR regulations being
printed material, whilst I think he held that they would be
technically a violation under ITAR.  ITAR was the active regulation at
the time.
True enough.

@_subject: spam is a good thing (was Re: Spam IS Free Speech) 
The problem is that you and most of the rest of the internet world are
renting your mega phones/accounts out without charging for usage
volume.  You are also allowing completely free use of your account as
a recipient, and completely free use of your sendmail as a mail hub
If this causes you grief, you need to start metering, and charging
postage to receive mail, and metering mail hub usage.
If I offered to supply a completely unmetered water supply, and there
were no clause in the legal agreement prohibiting it, I could use the
water supply to drive a mini-turbine and draw free electricity from
it, just pouring the water back down the drain.
If you have a cell-phone where it costs you to receive calls, and
people call you lots with junk marketing calls, I'd argue that it was
your problem.  You'd need to switch to a cell phone provider which
puts all the call metering charges on the caller.  (Cell phone
tarriffs are structured this way in the UK, I understand some/most
cell phones in the US, the receiver pays part or all of the call, this
seems a dumb arrangement).  If it's still economical for junk callers
to call you put a tariff on your line for non-designated callers.
It's a mean world, not every one plays nicely, if you offer free
services where the user gets some value, it _will_ get abused.  The
quicker crypto technology is used to fix this on the internet the
better, otherwise we get dumb government laws governing email usage
for some thoughts on a short term solution to metering.  Long term
solution use ecash.
Long term solution charge for your IP packets per packet.  If you get
lots of "business" use the proceeds to buy more bandwidth, or put up
your prices.
Of course I sympathise with your plight on the recieving end of this
crap in the meantime.  Try if you can to think of it this way: spam is a good thing because
it draws our attention to underlying vulnerabilities in internet mail
transport protocols.  It's better that we are incentivized to fix
these problems (and Spamford/cyberpromo is doing us a service by
providing this incentive), than it is to leave it to governments to
"fix" the problems by dragging laws into it, which will likely result
in "Internet drivers licenses" and other undesirable effects.
Cypherpunks, I think should be involved in providing crypto solutions
to allow metering for services, using anonymous ecash.  If we don't do
it, someone else will, and it won't be anonymous.

revealing his blinding value, and use this to obtain the identity of
each remailer hop by colluding with the bank.  (The bank keeps a
database of the blinded coins minted against who they were given to;
unblinding reveals the coin which can then be compared against those
deposited by remailers, tallying sender with remailer, all the way to
the exit remailer.)
To stop this, the sender should discard the blinding values, thereby
removing his ability to be later coerced, or to later trace the
recipient of his cash.
Is there a way to purge blinding values from the ecash directory?

do with the fact that you are now $100 worse off, and as if I had

Your solution is to require legislation, or court intervention ("he
can be charged with criminal trespass").  So how are you going to get
a reasonable prosecution rate on this one?  Perhaps replace cash with
a traceable form, so that you can trace who it was that took your

trace the thief.  Perhaps have the government put video cameras up at

The costs and unattractiveness of government intervention are even

I noticed an example of the sort of reporting standards which the news
media is sinking to in reporting on Jim Bell's case... observe these
two quotes:
The Oregonian, May 20, 1997, Metro Section P-1:
: Daly described his friend of 15 years as a "bit of an odd unit" but never
: dangerous and never serious about attacking the 9-1-1 systems or the
: Bull Run watershed.
: "I'd rat him out in a heartbeat for that," Daly said.
So... Daly considered Jim to be merely discussing technical
feasibility of attacks, something we do every day on cpunks.  Daly
says if he had ever considered Jim was thinking of carrying out any of
the hypothetical attacks, that he would have reported him instantly.
OK... now this other quote from another news story (forwarded by
Dimitri to the list from a post in or.politics quoting some newspaper).
: And during the interview Daly appeared to crack and turn state's : evidence when Daly offered to "rat (Bell) out in a heartbeat."
Sounds like a quote of the same comment by Daly.
Sounds like the newspaper(s) in question are having fun, creatively
misquoting, and fabricating to work up a story.  Not knowing the truth
behind any of this stuff, it makes one wonder how much truth there is
in the other details of the story as reported by the gutter press.
I noticed someone called "the Oregonian" the local
fishwrap... presumably implying it is one of those sensationalist
news-fiction newspapers, which are continually being sued for liable
for printing fictitious garbage about media personalities.  Perhaps
similar to the UK "the Sun", etc. (a combination of titilating

EAR says that you can't export crypto in electronic form.  EAR says
you can export crypto in textual form.  We have electronic cash in
terms of MT banks digicash.  Email is more convenient for exporting
crypto source code and binaries that snail mail.
Let's do it.
Here's what we need:
1. US entrepreneur to accept mail with    US volunteer strips off first two headers, prints out the document
   in a large OCR friendly font.  Puts in envelope and posts at
   highest priority snail that can be paid for out of the included
   postage (overnight/air-mail/slow-boat).
2. Non-US entrepreneur to scan and remail results
   US volunteer scans the sheets, mails/post them to the requested
   email address/newsgroup, and collects his digicash fee per sheet.
I volunteer for   (You understand the importance of the
Scanning-Fee, I can pay someone to feed sheets into a scanner if needs
be with a fee, without that I can become overloaded with a ream of
paper representing the binary for PGP5.0).
Legal questions: I'd be interested in legal interpretations of whether
the above scheme is legal for the US entrepreneur.  Peter Junger said
a short while ago on the list that printed material could be exported
under the EAR regulations administered by Commerce Dept.  Does this
scheme qualify?
Technical questions: If this is to include uuencoded or radix-64 mime
encoding, we might want to think about redundancy to allow error
correction.  Perhaps we want that anyway to ensure that what we have
is 100% character-by-character perfect.  Or perhaps not as it may
damage the legality aspects.  They may start saying that you can only
export human readable stuff on paper, etc.  Then we move on to `texto'

remailer messages.

@_subject: pgp5.x bashing (Re: [SURVEY] pgp5.x / pgp2.x users) 
I think it is somewhat understandable that the windows and mac
versions work well before the unix versions, even if painful.  The way
that `make install' over-writes your pgp2.x binaries is mildly
annoying also.  (And the way the binary can't handle being renamed to
pgp5 -- insists on being called pgp which makes it more difficult to
have it coexist).
(An aside: I understand the linux version (that is if you use the unix
version under linux) is supposed to be free for any use (even
commercial) at least that's what Phil Zimmermann said sometime back --
this was to humor a Richard Stallman.)
Hmm.  It's not _completely_ incompatible, it's only broken.  If the
pgp5.x user uses an RSA key it works ok.  So people who want to
interoperate should generate two keys, one DSA/EG pair, and one RSA
key.  Use RSA for talking to pgp2.x, and DSA/EG for talking to 5.x.
(Or use RSA for everything, but 5.x has some security advantages
(better 0xdeadbeef resistance, no fingerprint spoofing problem,
separate signature and encryption keys, key expiry, etc)).
Problem is pgp5.x doesn't automate this.  It could.  It doesn't I
think because they are trying to get people to move away from RSA,
also perhaps (speculation here) because they are trying to get you to
pay for the new version.  (Though there are still freeware versions,
commercial users will need to switch, and some people may pay so they
get tech. support, etc.)
I figure a more friendly way for pgp5.x to behave would be to generate
both sorts of key (RSA and DSA/EG) and automatically do the right
thing depending on public key type of person being communicated with.
I wouldn't say this is "forced", more that they haven't gotten to it
yet due to time pressure.  It's probably quite fiddly to get right.
Uh yeah, well you won't get any arguments from me on the CMR front;
CMR is basically clipper VI (or whatever the clipper version is now).
If you're interested, watch  and enigma
 presently they'll add pgp5.x
compatibility.  enigma and systemics cryptix is in _java_, you can't
get much more portable than that.  enigma works with any configurable
SMTP / POP3 MUA (netscape, eudora (I presume), etc)
Probably someone will do this if the CMR debacle carries on.  I have
already heard some speculation on an alternative source tree branching
off from pgp2.6.x.
Watch ietf-open-pgp too, it'll be interesting to see what happens if
the long waited for draft from PGP includes CMR.

This is getting kind of repetitive.  Perhaps you could provide a
counter example to disprove my claim that democracies result in more
petty privacy and freedom invasive laws than would be the case with a
pure market anarchy (perhaps old Iceland would be a suitable anarchy
to consider as a comparison).  Do you have a democracy in mind which
doesn't result in lots thought crimes and other "crimes" which are so
far removed from normal free market schelling points.  It's just a
natural tendency of a democracy.
Who?  What?  Current democracices.  When?  Now.  Why?  Market
distortion.  How?  Politicians brokering legalised mass theft and
market distortion for game theoretic reasons.
You prove your assertion: are you saying there are no gun controls in

What others?  Give me some other views to compare for realistic value.
You're right, what I said was:

murder rates were low to as far as I understood.  That's what I was
thinking when I wrote that.  (Of course I can't complain about your
statement above, you're right ... I didn't write what I was
thinking :-)
That bit was a statement of a belief that few people would be inclined
to invade someones privacy and attempt to impose sanctions for what
they viewed as thought crimes.  It takes governments or religions to
do this kind of thing, individuals aren't likely to -- the natural
schelling points would be far less invasive.  My thought was that if
some crazy person went invading peoples houses telling them how to
behave that that crazy person would have a decreased life expectancy

I had a go at doing something with it (I'll let you know when I get it
to work) -- I had the damnest job figuring out what was going on.  The
problem I found with understanding it were all of the nested functions
called through vectors of functions and handler functions.  Makes it
hard to inspect what will happen without running the code under a
debugger -- lots control flow is decided at run time.
Sounds maybe worth doing.
Some C programmers do have fun writing obfuscated chicken scratchings,
but you _can_ write C code optimised for readability.
What language did you have in mind?  modula-3?  iso-pascal/borland
Theoretically perhaps, however I'm not sure a system will get very far
unless it can automatically interoperate with pgp2.x and 5.x.  You
could build something which did the right thing automatically based on
public key types:
hypothetical cpunks mail system (HCMS)
HCMS -> pgp2.x   use RSA/MD5/IDEA and pgp2.x message formats
HCMS -> pgp5.x   use DSA/EG/3DES/SHA1 and pgp5.x message formats
HCMS -> HCMS     use whatever goodies you want, stego, mixmaster, etc.
decision of compatibility mode to use would be based on public key
type you're sending to.
This is more secure I agree.  The real kicker with this problem is
people who turn on encrypt to self -- I don't want messages with
encrypt to self (an extra door into the message) on them in my
mailbox, nor coming over the wire headed to me.
You can see the reason for multiple recipient though -- it's too ease
integration into mailers -- you can process the message and give it
back to the mailer, and then it can still send the message To: x, y;
Doing away with multiple crypto recipient risk is more an issue of MUA
integration than rabid conservation of bits.
(Btw., if you've looked at pgp formats you will observe a tendency to
hand huffman encode everything -- yuck, makes decoding and encoding
fiddly, makes code bloat, is extra complexity which makes
implementation mistakes more likely).
Yes.  I was thinking this also.  Really paranoid cypherpunk mail
delivery should be via mixmaster, and should be forward secret.
You don't have to use it.  I tend not to.  I never use encrypt to
self, and I get annoyed with people who send me messages encrypt to
themselves, and very rarely do I use Cc on encrypted messages.
Well unless there's something wrong with IDEA it's fairly moot anyway.
Brute force of 128 bit key space is out of the question.
If IDEA did turn out to be weaker than thought -- say effective key
space turned out to be 64 bits -- then there would be some small value
to obscuring known plaintext.  But this doesn't argue for or against
compression -- firstly compression has I think a fixed known header
anyway, and secondly -- the weird IDEA CFB method includes a 16 bit
checksum anyway, which will mean that you have an instantly verifiable
way of reducing the need for more complicated checks to be only once
every 65536 keys tested.  Then you have the CTB on the contained data

Now, on the receiving end of Jim's argument style I come to understand
how those 100 article long flame wars that I never bother reading that
he gets involved with come about :-) Anyway, heedless to the folly,
I'll dive right in, it is quite interesting  :-)
You complained earlier about misquotation, your quotation style is
unusual, it looks like you're pressing the `forward' button rather
than `reply'.
A free market.  (That should have said pure _free_ market).
Crypto anarchy is free market principles left to run with no
government.  Some people claim that this would actually work pretty
well.  The theory being that it gives you, the individual, maximal
choice.  Not only can you choose whether to purchase a "boob-tube", or
to instead spend the money on other things, but you can choose
protection services, laws, social insurance services, etc.
A problem with democracy is that some decisions are taken centrally
which reduces individual choice.
A bill of rights is nice, if anybody takes any notice of it.  If
nobody takes any notice it's just a piece of paper.
Crypto anarchy tends to protect your rights because typically your
rights are worth more to you than they are for others to take from
you.  Eg. your neigbours might not want to risk your wrath in invading
your house to see if you smoke something which they don't smoke.  Ie
it hardly matters one way or another to you what your neigbours do
inside their house.  But to you it matters a lot what you're free to
do.  So you can buy a .44 hand gun fairly cheaply.  Now if your
neigbour gets nosy, you can make clear that if he tries invading your
house you will be likely to aerate his skull.  Even if he is better
armed, or whatever, his small gained value in perverse amusement and
satisfaction in annoying you probably isn't worth the risk to him that
you may succeed in blowing him away.
Difficult to predict of course.  However large corporations are
typically subsidized by democratic governments.  This is a fairly
natural outcome if you think about it, because democracy is in most
current day examples quite biased to best represent the wishes of
those in positions to make large campaign contributions.  Hence the
term `corporate welfare'.
Microsoft's current $1M/day fine is one counter example.
Do you have to buy microsoft software?  I sure don't buy any.  The
microsoft software that I have used (on equipment bought by employers)
is very poor quality, I'd recommend other vendors on quality for the
most part.
What do you figure they're going to do?  Nuke their competitors?
Someone will try to break the monopoly if it is charging to high
prices.  IBM could easily compete with Bill Gates -- however I hear
they don't bother upgrading OS/2 (an infinitely superior product) to
win95/winNT compatibility because they fear government monopoly
actions against themselves.
No pay, no goods.  Sounds good to me!
(I'm not sure what the stated problem was -- too many rail roads?
Surely that's self regulating: too many becomes too competitive, too
low profit margin, the less efficient ones go bankrupt.)
A government supported monopoly if ever I heard of one.  (Oooh that
statement is going to get me in trouble).
I can't see any reason for any of your wishes to come true if there is
no one who can profit from fulfilling those wishes.
An independent third party arbitrator service who's arbitration
services and terms were agreed up front in the contract?
Yes.  Representation of the $, excellent.
I don't know what your business is, but you're bright I'm sure you'll
thrive in a free market.
None.  Their interests are to keep their customers happy so that they
buy more products and services.  If you aren't a customer, or they
can't see any gain in helping you they may tell you to fuck off.
Sounds fair enough to me.  You want to pass laws telling them what
they can do with their resources?
Anonymous payments, no reporting requirements.  Who are they going to
black ball?  Just start another nym.
That's fine by me.  If PGP Inc's price is fair, they'll do well.  If
it's too high they'll be under cut, and be forced to adjust or lose
trade to competition.
Go into a different line of business?  Buy the resources on the black
market?  Find another supplier of those resources, start a company to
supply those resoureces yourself.
There is a danger that if monopolies thrive it could get dangerous.
However I'm not sure even then it's going to be worse than the current
situation... 50% income tax?  Corporations will I think learn that a
satisfied happy employee works harder.  It simply isn't worth it to
them to piss you off.  Also I'm not sure large corporations are the
most efficient company size -- I suspect some of them may fragment
without generous corporate welfare programs.
I tend to think there would be an economic boom... all those previous
unproductive government employees joining the work productive force.
Sounds fair enough to me.  If an individual can't manage his own
finances, perhaps he would be better off in some kind of managed
community.  Better than having the state steal money off productive
people to fund his laziness or ineptitude.
That's a strange statement.  Economics is reality.  If you can't
persuade people to part with their money through their own volition,
it's theft!  People's charity is your only recourse if you are unable
to provide any services.  Taking charity at gun point tends to annoy
people, and tends to be called theft.
Disolve government, that should be a good way of separating it from

If some people preferred democracy such sheeple could find a company
who would be happy to fleece them of 50% of their incomes, and
institute local ordnances such as 10 year incarceration for smoking of
selected herbs.
Yes.  However democracy is a good way to ensure that some powerful

Here's a short summary of a more secure and less politically
controversial alternative to CMR:
1. Escrow employee company use encryption keys.
2. Don't escrow employee personal use encryption keys.
3. Don't escrow employee company use signature keys.
As pgp5 packet format already supports multiple encryption sub keys
attached to signature keys, all that has to be done to support the
above is to put comments in the userID to say what purpose the keys
are for:
Jon Callas  (personal use)
Jon Callas  (company use)
Provide support in the business verion of the software to escrow the
company use key.  Provide support for both company use and personal
use keys.  If some companies want to disallow personal use, you might
consider adding this feature.

Java isn't so bad.  Just in time compilers are being shipped with some
browsers (netscape on some platforms).  Sun now has native bigint
library (good for you know what, and exportable because they haven't
included the few lines required to implement public key encryption
with it).
Modula-3 is also fairly clean... garbage collection, bounds checked
arrays, etc.  A `safe' language.  There is indeed a m3 -> c
translator.  I think GNU were working on a m3 module for their
retargetable gcc compiler suite (to go with ada, C, fortran, pascal).
I did hear talk of a java gcc front end also.
I think there would be advantages to always tunneling the encrypted
messages inside PGP, that way no snoops know you're using it, until
it's too late.
That's a reasonable idea if you're going to use things like IDEA( k1,
3DES( k2, data ) ).
Forward secrecy is what you want for GAK resistance -- can't get much
more GAK hostile than burning your keys seconds after message receipt.
What's wrong with the randseed.bin and the public and private key
rings is that they should all be encrypted with a key derived from
your passphrase.
Linux's /dev/random might not be bad.  There is some real entropy in
key strokes and mouse movements, and they are quite conservative about
entropy estimation.  You can easily make it more conservative -- XOR
together a load of it to derive a smaller key.
That'd be fine.  Personally not being a hardware type, I am suspicious
of hardware RNGs.. I can't tell when they are going wrong.. failure
modes can be dangerous (whoops lead fell of geiger tube), etc.
Software and computers are easier to understand.  Provided you XOR the
lot together you should be fine though.
One thing that is sorely needed in my opinion is a simple way to
integrate with existing mailers.  Ie to have some code which acts as
an interface between various extensible email based functions
(remailers, signatures, DC nets, keyservers) and MUAs.  Then someone
gets to fight with the plugin API once, and after that we can
automatically add features which work with lots of MUAs.
The future is in extensibility.  Java is pretty good for this.

It depends what you call free.  If someone puts a copy of eudora pro
5.67 or whatever other commercial software up on the eternity service,
is that "free"?
It is free to the extent that it is unlikely that you will be caught.
It is even less likely that you will be caught if you are a nym using
remailers mostly.
The difference with an anonymous cryptoanarchist run software house is
that you know that they probably aren't paying taxes on their sales.
So you have additional assurance that they can't touch you if you use
their software -- they'd have to blow their cover unless they just
made a donation to AP or something:-)
People copy commercial software all the time.  I suspect only some
small fraction of personal use software is ever paid for.  Companies
are less likely to do this because they are larger and more worth
going after, and because the SPA software police have caused some
companies problems already.
The shareware, beggarware, or "charityware" approach of giving it away
for free, and then demanding or begging payment is partly an
acknowledgement that there is no way to stop you redistributing it
even if they demanded payment up front.  Plus the advantage that you
get free distribution, if people like it, it'll be all over the place
in no time.  Beggarware has worked for a few people, I think, perhaps
ID software's DOOM was one example.  Yes most people didn't pay, but
the free advertising more than compensated I suspect.
We to frown on protocols which rely on "please give me money", or "and
then we call the cops".  Payment protocols should be clean.
One alternative which Intel is brewing up for us is clipper CPUs which
do things against their owners interests, like encrypted instruction
schemes... nasty stuff.  This would then be used to ensure your copy
of the software won't run on other peoples machines.  That could be
enabling technology for all sorts of snooping.
One idea which I did like was the open bidding for a product to be
developed, people interested in the feature or product pay how much it
is worth to them up front, developers bid to take the job on.  After
it's done the software is freeware.  Supporting ideas discussed before
on this topic are that first to complete gets paid, or lowest bidder
presents completion bond, and that there are independent aribitrators
checking quality.
There was someone who posted to the list that he was going to set this
up.  He even purchased the domain name if I recall.  What happened,
did anything come of it?

That principle works to some extent, particularly for the bandwidth
impoverished, and the currently bloated games software trying to fill
CD-ROMs with unnecessary junk for one presumes this very purpose.
Leave the bandwidth a while, and the problem may arise again.
I wonder at 2c/minute, say 2k/sec (28.8 modem) that's 6Mb/$ for me
(don't have free local call UK side).  That's $100 for a 600Mb CD!
So as long as the CD costs under $100 and the unnecessary bloatware is
hard for a warez hacker to strip out, that makes it worth buying the
Another advantage of having the CD is that it's a backup copy, and you
can keep large stuff (say electronic copies of manuals) on it without
chewing up disk space which is more expensive.
Be interesting to see what happens to software copyright as bandwidth
gets more plentiful, as huge solid state mass storage gets cheaper,
and as information becomes harder to track with widespread crypto, and
nicer anonymous protocols enabled by high bandwidth everywhere come

I think that there is also a facility in the pgp5.5 for business
client to add yet another recipient: the sending companies snoop key.
I also got the impression that the policy enforcer could be set up to
bounce mail internally which did not have this extra recipient.
(Note, not having pgp5.5 for business to play with I am going on what
others have said.)
So now you've got mail headed out encrypted to 3 long term keys... if
the sender uses encrypt to self that will be 4 long term keys!  Then
the spooks in the sending country will want to be another recipient,
and spooks in the receiving country will also, bringing us to a total
of 6 long term keys.  Wew talk about security risks!
I thought it would be a good feature to put into the SMTP agent to
strip encrypt to self and recipients intended for internal snooping --
that would bring the recipients back down to 2 (or 4 with spooks).
Better still would be one recipient (as happens with adhoc local
escrow), and make that key a short term key which is burned after
expiry also.

@_subject: entropy theft (Re: Privacy Software) 
You might get some entropy from it -- but you won't get my PRNG state!
An attacker is welcome to the entropy, but may find it cheaper to
generate his own entropy than to copy some of mine.
There are certain attacks which become possible when an attacker can
snarf a copy of your randseed.bin, eg. the attacker can predict
session keys if he can guess your plaintext, and you are using an
environment which does not allow pgp2.x to sample your keystrokes (eg
integrated mail scripts).
randseed.bin is more sensitive than people treat it.  pgp2.x encrypts
private keys because people could use them to decrypt traffic, but it
does not encrypt the randseed.bin which could in some circumstances
also allow traffic to be decrypted.
An ergonomic disadvantage of encrypting randseed.bin is that you would
need to enter the passphrase to decrypt it before being able to
encrypt messages.  (You could make that optional -- and just use it in
encrypted form when you couldn't be bothered entropy shows through :-)
Encrypted public and private key rings is a separate good, and this
because it obscures who you are talking to and what your nyms are.
premail does this for you.

@_subject: church of crypto anarchy (Re: Taxing Churches for their views? Bad idea. (fwd)) 
Seems to me that the distinction that churches are exempt from taxes
partly hinges on their non-profit, or not-for-profit status.
Now it's nice for those who can get tax breaks, as we surely all could
do with a few tax breaks after the double and triple taxation effects
which Tim describes.
But really it does seem kind of artificial -- what is a church, who
gets to decide, and as TruthMonger said who gets to decide on which
church status gets revoked because of statements which annoy the rule
Can I be a church and not pay taxes too?  (eg. Can I claim to be a
member of `The Cult of the Dead Cow' or whatever and not pay taxes?)
Scientologists are a fine example of a "church" which is largely
profit motivated.
Even if you drew the line at non-profit organisations that is easily
manipulated -- non-profits can pay good wages, and siphon money out in
other creative ways.  (Like those TV evangelical Bible bashers with
their fleets of Rolls Royces who get found out and disgraced now and

Now it is an interesting question as to whether it is a good idea to
encourage governments to tax churches or not.  Taxation is a weapon.

The insurer can't determine whether you've taken the test.  The
insurer may insist on the test anyway or offer you unfavourable odds,
basically assuming you have privately tested and found positive
otherwise you wouldn't be refusing to have the test.  (A variation of
the `he must have something to hide' theme).  Unless you can afford
the premium for withholding this test, you're stuck.
The insurance company would have no financial incentive to take on
such risks -- I reckon they'd sooner let the wanna-be customer die.
Nasty, but it's reality.
I reckon your only option would be charity.  If these $1,000,000
treatment 1:1,000,000 odds genetically testable diseases are rare
(1:1mil is rare), perhaps a charity would be able to cover the costs.
The increased choice in insurance would ensure cheaper medical care
for all.  A deregulated medical profession with third party rating
services rather than top down government services should reduce prices
dramatically also.  Same for medical drugs, third party ratings.  Buy
your ratings service.
And being a hard line anarcho capitalist, I draw the conclusion that
if you can't afford to keep yourself alive, that is your problem.
(Heartless ain't it:-) Aside from comments about evolution in action
(perhaps I personally don't want to fund propogating these genetic
defects, and that is my choice), my suggestion is that such cases
would have to be met by charity.
A charity could also refuse to help people who hadn't donated, if
it chose.
I bet it would work too, and a lot more efficiently than the
government regulated setup now.
Heck I might even donate to it, with the savings I'd make from
the breakup of the medical cartel.

@_subject: Protocols for Insurance to Maintain Privacy 
Saying that it would be a charity is just a statement of reality.
There exist no methods to insure when there is a near certainty of a
payout being required, as I think we all agree (Tim, Adam, Jon).
To call it anything other than charity is misleading, so I am really
just arguing for honesty in advertising.  (Something socialists are
not big on :-)
An insurance company would probably find customers and hope to make a
profit by offering a mutual fund, or charitable donation service.
There would be an agreement as to who could claim, and what types of
illness were covered, maximum payouts etc.  Then the business would
use the funds (minus it's profit margin) to pay for those treatments
affordable within the current funds.
This means that as funds may be limited that some people will go
untreated, if their treatments are too expensive and funds are short.
Efficient usage of funds is expected -- if it costs $1m to fix up some
old guy to live for a couple more years as opposed to giving cheaper
treatments to several younger people, well the old guy gets to die.
This might seem heartless to socialist types, but this kind of
decision gets made all the time by medics, who don't have unlimited
funds even in socialist countries.  In the UK some practices are funds
holding, which means that they get to manage their own money, they get
to decide which drugs to use, and who to give them to, and they get to
use profits (or more correctly surplus government grants) in certain
ways (equipment, etc).  (Or they did, Labour were threatening to
confiscate these surpluses).  I talk to medics a bit, as I am into
medical messaging security, and some of the people are bilingual
medics and medical informatics people.  Examples are drugs which are
3% more effective but cost 5x the price.  These kinds of optimisation
of available resources problems are all over the place in medicine,
and doctors balance these within budgets.
Another example is that doctors are able to tell smokers with lung
cancer who refuse to stop smoking that they will not treat them.  Or
switch off life support machines if it looks pretty hopeless, and is
costing a fortune to keep a half-alive person ticking over.
The failure with mutual funds is that people will attempt to start
donating once they realise they have some big medical bills coming (if
only donators get payouts).  To combat this the company might perhaps
have a policy of not paying out within 5 years of the first donation.
Then you'll have the counter attack of people re-selling proof of
donation receipts.  And then the company can counter that with a hash
of DNA code mixed in to the donation receipt such that only with the
patients consent can the receipt be used to link to him. The key point is the choice.  Many companies, many choices, freedom to
donate or not, or to stipulate terms of donation (eg., not to fund
lung cancer treatment for smokers).
It seems to me that people are on average more generous and charitable
than socialists would have us believe also.  For example a charity to
support people who had no insurance, or hit the maximum payout on
their insurance might get donations.  Perhaps even enough donations
that it would cover most cases.

Michael Wilson <0005514706 at MCIMAIL.COM> forwards:
Where they pervert commercial key recovery to mean central government
master access.  Nasty lies expertly spin-doctored.
Where criminals who rate the expense of wiretaps will be using pgp2.x
downloaded from Russia, or where ever.  More spin doctoring.
And there it is, they now want to encourage private sector key
recovery.  Now why would they want to do that, if they don't plan to
use it as an infrastructure.
And there so soon we have another repetition of Freeh's comments about
mandatory being necessary.
I don't buy this at all.  For an infrastructure attack you're worried
about pervasive problems in case someone tries to bring down the whole
system.  Building central control in _anything_ is asking for trouble
in info war terms.  Everything should be as distributed as possible,
to minimise scope of an attacker who compromises keys.
Law enforcement with the master keys to the whole country is a huge
risk.  Some law enforcement key custodian will simply be bribed or
coerced for the key, and then they really will have an info war risk.
They want to fast track mandatory government access also.
A dangerous climate to be building any recovery systems in, however
carefully constructed to reduce risks.  I am having doubts about the
safety of working on even about anything but the most ad-hoc local
recovery at this point.
Really gunning for it this time.  13 recovery pilots, NIST and NSA
involvement, standards setting.
That's a new one... give us master key access now, and we'll think
about allowing exceptions at some point in the future.
The main problem is the security and risk of government abuse.  I'm
not that sure cost or feasibility is a problem.

I am pleased that you are discussing with us crypto politics in

I would've thought that the NSA's world policeman attempts would be
resented by Japanese secret service types.  I get the impression there
are tensions between EU, UK and US secret services.
Well be careful of doing deals with the devil.  Several crypto
lobbying groups in the US some suspect did more harm than good.  These
groups lost their no compromise stance, and ended up helping to draft
laws to ban crypto because they thought they could make the laws
mildly less obnoxious by doing so.  It may even have been the case
that they had a net negative impact on freedom of crypto.  Making
deals with politicians is a dangerous game to play.  They are
opinionless power brokers, and will just use you as a bargaining chip.

type of policy.  They will be conditioned to expect this.  Governments
will of course encourage corporates to use such software.
I'd prefer to see an "off-the-record" option: a personal comment
option, with non-transferable signatures, and no GAK; this would give
the user the option to have the mail as an official company statement,
by clicking "official company business" button, and an option for
unofficial, or "not an official statement" button, which are more akin
to phone conversations which are typically not recorded.
Personal comments are in any case probably in the companies interests
not to have transferable proof of authorship attached to.  Many email
comments are sent with a few seconds thought, a sort of too and fro
banter between employees, some of whom have business company contacts
who are also personal friends, etc.  Actually for maximal
non-transferability all "not an official statement" email should be
sent via mixmaster remailers, otherwise mail logs etc, may give some
material which could be used as proof of authorship.
This set up seems less troublesome than pgp's offering with pgp5.5.  I
reckon it's more sensible to archive "official company business"
communications in the normal way.  Compose the message in a word
processor, archive that, or build in an archive mechanism into the
MUA/mail encryption system which encrypts to a storage system.
Communications encryption keys should be transient, otherwise you are
opening your self up to the less often considered form of key escrow:
your company or you are presented with a court order for your keys.
Or the Feds burgle your offices and install keyboard sniffer.  If
they're interested in you they will already have hoovered up your past
email with cooperation of your leased line providor.
I really think people are asking for trouble not using forward secrecy
for secured email.  The attacker can archive all your encrypted email,
and then decrypt at his leisure if he is able to compromise your key
at a later date.
Also I seem to remember that Tim, or perhaps someone else, reported
that PRZ stated at a recent cpunks meeting that he would quit PGP Inc
if they went for a GAK option.
Well Phill?  Getting pretty close ain't it?

The passwords alone don't do you any good: if you read them out over
the phone, Eve can just repeat them.
You need to combine the password with the part of the D-H parameter
hash displayed on the dinky little secure phone display in such a way
that Eve can't fake it without knowledge of your password.  It would
be nice if you didn't need a computer to perform this operation, but I
guess you could live with needing a computer.  It would also be nice
if the number of digits you had to read was relatively short.
XOR doesn't work, because Eve can undo that; XOR isn't very easy to do
mentally anyway.
Encrypting the display value with a symmetric cipher and a key formed
from the password and reading out a selection of digits from the
ciphertext would do.  But most/all symmetric ciphers worth speaking of
are beyond doing in your head, or with a piece of paper in a
reasonable amount of time.
How many digits are on the display of one of those phones?  It seems
that you should be able to concoct something which is easy to compute,
and offers as much surety as the few digits on the display.

Yes.  But that just means that you need commitments to prevent a MITM
brute forcing a key with the same partial hash.
I don't see that commitments on DH parameters do anything to prevent
someone who can impersonate voices, as far as I can see it is all
going to collapse back to whether the attacker can impersonate voices
and splice in without audible noise.
How about touch tone keypad (phone).  Bit tedious?  Or temporarily
plug unit into a PC's modem port?
What about... a key server on a phone number.  You call key directory
services, you type in phone number, and your phone downloads
certificates and phone numbers, and uploads it's own certificate.
Also put the keyserver on the internet.
Too much complexity probably, if most of your users won't be using it
as it will add to cost.
But I do think it would be a good idea for you to include
documentation on a good secure way to use a PGP signature to exchange
use-once keys suitable for printing on a sheet of A4 which would keep
a user going for a few hundred calls.  Plus easy to follow description
of how to use.  Your suggestion in another post in this thread was a
challenge response.  Say you printed a matrix of random numbers or
words which were exchanged before hand via PGP.  And then use the
digits of the hash on the LCD screen to do a table lookup.  The
attacker won't be able to do his MITM because he won't know the table,
and so won't know what value he should read.

@_subject: What's really in PGP 5.5? 
If PGP wants to archive data sent or received, well they can do so, but
sending encrypted communications over open networks encrypted to _two_ long
term public keys is bad security practice.
There are two reasons which are given as to why someone might want to
have GAK installed for company use.
1. to allow access to important material lost in the mail system in the
event that an employee is hit by a bus
2. to allow management to spot check the emails being sent and received
Argument 1 seems pretty flimsy to me.  I reiterate my comment in an earlier
post: who in their right mind keeps their _only_ copy of ultra valuable
company information bouncing around in the email system?  Did those arguing
for this position not notice that sometimes email gets lost in transit?
Regardless, if PGP claims to be catering to those who use this argument, and
to not want to try that hard to make it impossible to by-pass, the more
secure, and less GAK friendly way to do it is to have the mail client
software archive the email sent and received.
Argument 2 I find somewhat distasteful, but seems to me to be logically what
PGP's implementation is catering for.  A less GAK friendly way to implement
it, and a more secure (communications secure, not saying anything about GAK
being easier or harder to by-pass) way would be to archive for a while the
session keys. The security advantage being that the email doesn't go out
with the session key encrypted to 2 long term public key encryption keys.

Jon Callas  defends:
This is true but mainly I think for _storage_ keys.  PGP is being
discussed as an email communications system.  It's probably just as
likely that your email will disappear down a black hole as that you
forget your keys.
Your analogy doesn't fit.
All you're encrypting is something sent over a fairly unreliable
communications link.  If you lose the key, well heck you just get the
sender to resend it.  Happens every day with or without crypto.
(So you generate a new key, and get it certified, and publish your
revocation cert., if you have one).
This is the same mistake that Freeh and company make in arguing for
GAK.  It's a flawed argument.
Email itself is pretty fragile, and email is not commonly used for
long term storage.  (What are PGP are thinking? "gee, how best can we
best archive our master source tree ... I know we'll email it to our
colleague over here and delete it before I get confirmation it
Way I understand "data recovery" is that you have a recovery mechanism
for stored data.  Like you have backups of the keys for your hard disk
driver level encryption program, or encrypted back up program.
You either have misunderstood the data recovery argument, or are
attempting to rejig it to fit your argument.
I'm pretty sure said cypherpunks were chanting about storage keys:
keys for data stored on your disk, as opposed to the GAKkers wanting
access to your communications keys.
Bingo.  And your data is where?  On your disk.  Not in limbo being
passed around the flaky sendmail/mailserver hodge-podge that is
Internet mail.
No, no!  The simple solution to fragile encryption on fragile
communications data is to keep a copy of the email you sent!  Encrypt
and backup the keys for that all you want, and you won't get any GAK
No you didn't, you built a GAK system.
Yes, and your archives are going to be where?  On backup tapes, on an
encrypted partition on his hard disk... not in the email system.
Sad story.  I venture to suggest, however, that the product source
code was not stored solely in your email box, nor I expect did the
last copy of your source tree happen to be en-route in encrypted
email which only he had the key for.
She might.  In which case you might secret split the key to your
encrypted partition, your lawyer and her, or whatever.
Nope, that's not it.  Data recovery is being able to recover stored
data.  "Key escrow" and "key recovery" are newspeak terms defined by
the GAKkers which mean that they want access to your communications
keys.  Your response should be to widely field systems using forward
secrecy, not to go along and implement GAK for them. [description of PGP GAKware elided]

Not at all.
People seem to be forgetting that we're talking about email security
Email isn't that reliable.  Email goes missing now and then.  Your DNS
is out, the receivers mail hub has a glitch and swallows it, whatever.
Are you really claiming that you will have email in transit which is
so valuable that your whole company will be in jeopardy if the
intended recipient dies unexpectedly?
More likely: you get the sender to resend it.
Don't confuse the issues surrounding need for backup of storage keys
with communications keys.  There is a definate need to take care to
have backups of keys used to encrypt backups and disks.  Not so for
communications keys.
I gave some alternative GAK unfriendly ways of archiving email in my
longer reply to PGP's Jon Callas defensive article on the NYT article.
If a company has a policy of approving outgoing email, I'd argue for a two
tiered system.  One for "official statements" which is approved, archived,
signed with a transferable non-repudiable signature.  And one for unofficial
communications, signed with a non-transferable signature, and perhaps
delivered via mixmaster.
The way to archive your outgoing email is not to have the email in transit
encrypted to an extra recipient.  The way to do it is to archive sent mail
in the senders MUA or at least internal to the senders offices.
You will notice that this then involves storage keys, which the GAKkers
aren't interested in.  Why aren't they interested in access to storage keys? Because they would have to issue a supeona and take the disks away before
they would have any use for them.  At that stage they'd just as well list
the keys to decrypt anything which is encrypted on the disks they seize.
The reason the GAKkers want access to communications keys is so that
they can read your email without you knowing.  So they can go on
fishing expeditions and use the evidence by saying that "an unanmed
source" tipped them off, etc.
By implementing GAK for corporates in such a GAK friendly way, PGP Inc
has helped the GAKkers.  I would be interested to persuade them to
change their architecture for archiving sent and received email.

@_subject: computationally infeasible jobs for MITMs (Re: Secure phone) 
I wonder if we can come up with a way to formalise this technique and
automate it.  I think it was James voiced something similar earlier in
the thread.
Using your example, the MITM faces a couple of problems: he has to
think on his toes, and think real fast.  Perhaps he can't think fast
Second problem, perhaps if he doesn't speak soon enough, he will have
blown it, because you are speaking continuously, and the second part
of the sentence constructs a problem from information already stated.
The first time the information is stated, the MITM doesn't have enough
information to change it.
Say he changed it to: "Hey eric I noticed the second digit..." (second
instead of third), just in case this would help him.  Well he doesn't
know what the challenge will be so he may just have created an
impossible to spoof problem for himself.  (The second digit probably
won't meet the challenge in the second part of the sentence).  So this
would force the MITM to construct a replacement challenge which does
match.  Given the short notice, and already decided first part, he may
have difficulty constructing a plausible sounding challenge which
meets his criteria.  "Is the ummm... square of your first digit".
How about this for a computerised method to do something similar.  Aim
of the game: to make the MITMs job computationally infeasible.
Say that we leave some noise in the speech channel.  Some of it isn't
really noise but encrypted data.  Say perhaps first stegoed packet is:
and second stegoed packet is:
and finally there is a mask which controls which bits of the noise are
actually encrypted data, and which are parts of the actual message.
Send this last:
Then send the three keys k1, k2, k3.
Then check that the packets1 and 2 reconsituted according to the mask
both decrypt to the same nonce.
The idea is that because of the mask, the MITM doesn't know which bits
to replace.  So he tries to construct his own challenge meeting that
protocol.  Fair enough he can do this.  But he will degrade the voice
quality because he will replace some more signal with noise.  Can we
tune this protocol so that the recipient can detect the extra noise?
Well, ok, if the recipient can detect the noise, surely the MITM can
too?  Yes but, choosing different bits to reduce the noise isn't free,
and the hope is that you can construct a system with an expensive
noise estimation function which is agreed to as part of the protocol.
So you find out 10 seconds into the conversation that there is a MITM.
The MITM has to compute this noise function in real time, to avoid
introducing lag.
It's not very good, but I'm sending it along anway, so that perhaps
y'all can improve on it,

[made a few snips to the CC line, still Cc of cypherpunks]
Lots of people.  See, what goes over a public network in the clear is
much more vulnerable than what sits on your disk.  I encrypt
communicated copies of things which aren't encrypted on the disk
myself.  I suspect you do too.
But, more to the point, my argument was that keys should have
segregated uses.  One key for storage, another for receiving encrypted
emails.  I wasn't saying that you wouldn't encrypt your archived sent
& received email.  I _was_ arguing that a better way to archive email
securely is to encrypt it with a separate storage key.
Bad move dude.
See you might have a 100 bit entropy passphrase, but the recipient
might have a password of "fred".  You've conveniently archived all
your email, and you've left it decryptable by a hodge podge of other
people with unknown level of care about your level security.
Say perhaps fred deleted the email after reading, even though he has a
poor passphrase.  You have just screwed your own security.
Similar problem if it is you that has a passphrase of "william".  I
won't thank you when the feds decrypt your email to me, thanks to a
you having a poor passphrase.  (Not that I'm suggesting you do).
If your email archives are encrypted with storage keys, you avoid all
these problems, and avoid GAK arguments at the same time.
Nope.  Email is communication.  Archived email is storage.  Use
communication keys for communicated email, and storage keys for
encrypting archived email.
This is a very important point, and I can't fathom why so many people
who are otherwise on the ball are not getting it.  If you don't escrow
any communication keys, but do escrow storage keys, the GAKkers don't
get what they want, and you get all the functionality you need.  They
actually have to break into premises, and take disks, and supoena
Right?  Simple enough isn't it?
Of course it's less secure.  It's less secure almost by definition.
Lets say you have your communications encrypted with only your key,
and there is a small probability call it p1 that your key is
compromised (key board sniffer virus, hidden video cam, typing
passphrase whilst on phone (yes?), whatever). Well if you encrypt to another key, say a corporate escrow key, there
is an additional chance, call it probability p2, that your security
can be blown by the corporate key being compromised.  So long as the
p2 is greater than 0, which I'm sure you'll agree it is, however
small, then you have less security by using multiple encryption.
I've been arguing against using encrypt-to-self for ages.  It simply
makes me cringe when people send me email which is encrypt to self.
Sounds like a good idea.

Perry (cryptography moderator) just killed the thread.  Some of the
participants may not be on cpunks, so keep them on the cc if you want
them to see your replies]
Of course you do.  Lets say you are using Peter Gutmanns encrypted
filesystem setup.  So, if you figure the info on the disk is
important, you give a copy of the key to the company lawyer, put it in
the fire proof safe, secret split it, whatever tickles your fancy.
The advantage of this is that the email software it is no use to the
GAKkers, because it doesn't have mildly enforced extra crypto
recipients, and it doesn't get the business community used to the idea
of shipping email around with extra doors into it.  PGP Inc's pgp5.5
could be used by the government to weedle their way into mandatory key
escrow.  Say that they start requiring companies to use this software,
then when lots of companies start using it, they start asking
companies for a copy of the company master key.  Bingo key escrow,
courtesy of PGP Inc.  Next they "encourage" ISPs to use it also.
There is so!  His mail said that there was a policy flag in the public
key, and an additional public key for the corporate back door.  That
policy flag effectively said this key has attached to it a request
that you encrypt to this extra crypto recipient.  In some cases an
additional flag will be set which says "if you do not comply with the
request to encrypt to the extra crypto recipient, the recipient will
not see the mail".  PGP Inc's method of enforcing this is an SMTP
policy enforcer which bounces mail without the extra crypto recipient.
There, that is an extra access to the communication (via an extra
route to accessing the session key).
Uhhh, I think I just realised why we are talking at cross
purposes... you meant extra access to the recipients private key.  I
consider this an artificial straw man, erected by Jon.  Sure it's an
independently dumb idea to have lots of people sharing private keys.
But the system is still GAK friendly.  And it does allow extra parties
access to the message.  The worry is that government becomes that
second party.
Do you really care about the details of mandatory GAK, when and if it
comes in.  Do you care whether the government has a copy of your
private encryption key, or whether the system is setup with
un-bypassable second crypto recipient of the USG/NSA etc.  Can't see
that it makes much difference at that point.
Both methods can be bypassed theoretically anyway, by super encrypting
or any other subliminal channels kicking around in the protocols.  So
I can't see that arguments about how easy they are to bypass hold much
water.  Frisbeeing a disk out the window is far easier a way to bypass
anyway.  Or just blabbing.
Yeah he probably does.  But he wants your communications keys a lot
You know why that is?
Because he has your communications because you're broadcasting them
across the Internet.  He'd like to read them.
However he doesn't have your disk, and he'd have to break into your
offices to get it, or issue you with a supeona or whatever.  I'm sure
he'd love to read your disk too, but your disk isn't sitting on an NFS
mount over the internet.  (Is it!?)  Fortunately, the internet
couldn't handle the strain, otherwise you might see calls for you to
rent your disk space of government disk farms, and the government
would then be very interested in demanding a copy of your storage keys.
So, if even if we use corporate key backup for storage keys, this is
still more along the lines of the status quo.  They want your
documents, they've gotta come and get them.
What we'all are getting worked up about here is that Freeh and friends
want to be able to key word search our damn communications on fishing
There is no information in the body of the message which is required
for it to get to it's destination.  All you need is the SMTP headers.
You clearly can't end-to-end encrypt the communications routing
information.  (You could layer it though, like perhaps remailers, with
each hop only knowing what it needs to know to do it's job; however at
that point you can run into problems: you can't bounce back a delivery
failure part way along the route.)
The point is that you shouldn't be mixing key purposes.
Communications private keys should be used to protect communication
and shouldn't be given to anyone else, even your company.  Storage
keys might be sensible things to backup within the company in case of
accidental death.
Actually I disagree with what you said: you said "if I delete the
message after receiving it, it can't be recovered", it might easily be
recovered in lots of ways:
1. feds have tap on your line, feds rubber hose your long term private
key out of you
2. your sender has kept a copy in the clear
3. your sender has kept a copy encrypted with a poor passphrase which
the feds guess/or rubber hose from him
4. your sender used encrypt-to-self, and has poor
passphrase/is passphrase rubber hosed
5. your sender kept a copy which still had you as a crypto recipient
(as well as himself with encrypt-to-self), and the feds arrive at your
door anyway.
Point is, as long as you've got the private keys, it is potentially
stored, courtesy of your favourite TLA.  This is why you should use
forward secrecy, or at least mimic it, by having a long term signature
key, and generating a new public key for encryption every week/month,
and revoking and destroying the old one.
Yes, it does, and that is GAK friendly.  But that is not what I
described above.
The difference between what I describe above (quoted a few lines up),
and what PGP is doing is that PGP's messages are sent across the
internet encrypted to the "recovery key".  This is GAK friendly
because it is easy to implement GAK with it, you just make that
"recovery key" the NSA's "recovery key" (or to avoid newspeak terms
perhaps that should be government backdoor master key).  Then they
coerce ISPs and corporates to include a PGP SMTP policy enforcer which
insists on all email having a second crypto recipient of the NSA's
backdoor master key.  The system is a beautiful GAK system, everything
you need for a fully working GAK system is right there on sale by PGP
With what I described, GAK is not possible.
What I described is: the MUA archives sent email, and archives
received email (after decryption) with none of this process leaking
outside the corporate lan (that is it may involve communication inside
the LAN).  The archives can be encrypted, and you can have a corporate
master key with access to these archives.  But none of this goes over
the Internet.
I'm not sure either, please let me know if I've explained myself this
I'm worried that the hard time I'm having getting people to grok that
escrowing comms keys is a bad idea if you're opposed to mandatory GAK
is indicative of the success of the memes being spread by Freeh's
crowd.  PGP Inc are especially worrying, as they are in a position to
influence the balance of whether we get GAK or not, and they appear to
be helping GAK out somewhat.  Whether this is complicit or whether
they don't see that the fact they've implemented a fairly feasible GAK
system as that significant in the argument, I'm not sure.
However, I think the argument it is relatively straight-forward:
companies care about backup of their data.  They don't care about
backup of their communications.  So why backup communications keys?
And why include the backup packet in the communication itself?
For those companies who have been persuaded that they ought to read
email received and email sent, you can implement this without
weakening comms security as PGP have done with pgp5.5 for business
which is to have a second crypto recipient for backup/backdoor being
sent with the message over the internet.
All you do for backup or company backdoor is to build in whatever
storage, and encrypted archiving functions you wish into the MUA, or
internal mail system.
That is GAK unfriendly.  If PGP Inc is still GAK unfriendly, and
hasn't sold out to government, it should be doing something with
similar properties to those I described above: not having backdoor
second recipient access to traffic. What they have done is implemented
a fully functional GAK system.
(I get the feeling that sooner or later we're going to get a PRZ
penned company position statement.  I hope they get it right.  I
encourage them to re-think.)

Thank you anonymous for some good feed back.
I was thinking more of a second archive for company use.  You can
leave the normal MUA archive alone if you have to.  The company
archive need not be on your machine; could, probably would, be another
machine inside the corporate LAN.
I do see advantages in using a different archive key for your own
archive if you can, but I don't think anybody much is doing this at
the moment anyway.
3 has an integrated archive of sent and received email.
IMAP mailboxes are interesting in this context.  (Mail stays in the
remote mail box -- you can't modify it, you've either got to delete
it, or leave it -- if it's encrypted you're stuck with that (other
than re-encrypting it and mailing it yourself).  IMAP is nice for
people who are mobile -- use different workstations/laptops each day.
But still, it doesn't present a problem.  You just archive it once
you've decrypted it.  Similar to your problem where you can't modify
the built-in archive method in the MUA.
Problem  what if you're outside the LAN?  You get inside the LAN with a VPN / ipsec setup, whatever, and do as
normal.  You'll have to if your mail box is in there.
True.  So?  Those calling for GAK for company use argue:
This one:
isn't often mentioned.
Item 1, recovering email in transit is bogus.  Recovering email after
receipt, is over-rated in my opinion.
Item 2, snooping on sent mail is an independent problem, not involving
the GAK argument.  (Just send via your mail approver, you sign, he
encrypts and sends on if he approves).
My suggestion does cater for item 3 because the MUA arranges for the
decrypted text to be archived after the employee has decrypted it.
To by pass this, the employee has to either: i) modify the software
to disable the archiving, or ii) not decrypt it at all.
Possibility i) doesn't seem like a major threat, there are ways to
hack around all of these escrow mechanisms.  PGP Inc are highlighting
the purposefully puny nature of their enforcement with the suggestion
that this makes it less GAK friendly.
Possibility ii) doesn't seem like that big a problem.  I presume this
is going to come about if the company has read a few emails, and from
the context of the other mails this one looks like the biggy, where he
is conspiring to do something against the companies interests.  Or
perhaps they are tipped off.  Anyway, my suggested solution would be
to ask the employee to decrypt it, and if he refuses, fire him.  Any
problems?  (If he's forgotten his key, get the sender to resend).
They're going to look a bit incompetent anyway, if this guy was
working on a project where he was the main player.  They'll have to
reorganise anyway.  Not really your corporate nightmare situation I
don't think.  All it requires is a bit if finessing on the part of
members of the departees team.
If he's an interchangeable employee (one of 20 sales people all doing
the same job), you won't be using this method anyway .. you don't want
to loose sales when your sales people go on holiday, there will be a
sales at megacorp.com which is encrypted to a company key.

I notice that the quality of anonymous submissions to the discussion
here on cypherpunks has increased markedly lately.
I can see a couple of reasons why this might be: Monty Cantsin seems
to write consistently good stuff, Tim May announced he may be using
some nyms, and we have this big argument with PGP Inc where their
employees may feel pressure not to speak out of line.  One suspects
that some of the anonymous contributors exploring the issues are
actually PGP employees:-)
Regardless of who the new anonymous contributors are, it's nice to see
quality anonymous posts, keep it up!

@_subject: access to storage keys, NOT comms keys! 
I was arguing for designing the system so that as much of the storage
functionality as possible is accomplished with separate storage keys.
So the solution is to engineer your email system to re-encrypt email
to a storage key before archiving.
You lose a couple of functionalities over a true key escrow system,
which a previous anonymous (don't know if you're the same anonymous)
identified well:
- if someone leaves / dies unexpectedly you can't decrypt email in
  their mail box.
- if the employee who is the crypto recipient refuses to decrypt the
  company won't be able to decrypt either.
However there are a couple of reasons why this isn't such a big deal,
and why people ought to get used to it.
i) How often do people die unexpectedly -- if this does happen the
company faces other similar problems, perhaps said employee had a few
things on a `to do' list stored in only in his head.  Perhaps he has
contacts the company doesn't have recorded.  The company will have to
do some extra work reorganising anyway.
ii) You can't avoid above problems if you're using forward secrecy;
you should be using forward secrecy for security reasons, so you'd
better get used ot the side-effects.
iii) You can minimise the negative effects if you ensure that the
people sending you email also have a matching system which ensures
that `official' sent email is all backed but up encrypted with a
storage key.  Then they _will_ have the email to resend.  This seems
likely in any event, if the importance of the email exchanges is so
important that the company wants to archive it, the sending company is
likely to also.  If the email gets lost in transit you'll need a copy
to resend already.
iv) It's worth the minor extra inconvenience because you can then plug
in forward secrecy, and you thereby have a double stance against GAK:
no key escrow, and no long term private encryption keys as fat
targets.  As a plus it's a security improvement also.

@_subject: Defeating MITM with Eric's Secure Phone 
We were discussing this problem before turning to talking about
automated methods.  I think Eric Blossom suggested this earlier on:
It seems like a good solution.  An interesting question might be how
many times can you use the same table without starting to leak values.
Perhaps it doesn't matter that much because the MITM can't exactly use
brute force on the problem otherwise you will know he's there.  He has
to act non-passively to extract information.  (Presuming the protocol
exchanges part of the information hashed for the challenge is
encrypted with the negotiated key).
What would be nice would be able to have information on one sheet of
paper which you could continue to use for lots of communications,
without need for calculator, or computer, or more emailed tables.
I considered this approach (XOR and + function) earlier in this
thread.  I don't think it works because the functions are commutative.
(Unless I'm missing some aspect of the system, perhaps the
interlock... it's a while since I've read the protocols.)
Here's why I think it doesn't work: We have Alice, Mallet and Bob.
Alice & Bob exchange via email password 123456.  The displayed digits
of the hash of Alice/Mallet's DH parameters are: 222222.  The
displayed digits of Mallet/Bob's DH parameters are: 333333.
Alice computes 123456 + 222222 = 345678; Alice says to Mallet: "345"
Bob computes 123546 + 333333 = 456789; Bob says to Mallet: "789"
Mallet recovers the first 3 digits of the passphrase from what Alice
said:	345 - 222 = 123
Mallet recovers the last 3 digits of the passphrase from what Bob
said:	789 - 333 = 456
Mallet has recovered the passphrase and can now spoof Alice to Bob and
Bob to Alice, he says: 456+222 = 678 to Alice, and 456+333 = 789 to
Same story with XOR, only it's harder to compute.
I think you need an encryption function.  It depends on how many times
you wanted to re-use the passphrase.  The "encryption" function could
be very weak for one use.  For lots of uses you'd need a real
encryption function.  Problem is encryption functions aren't typically
very easy to perform as mental arithmetic exercises; and
non-programmable calculators don't help much.
The table solution gets around this problem nicely, because it is a
secure way of using a one time password.  Possibly a relatively secure
way of re-using that password even, if mallet has to become active to
obtain information, and gets detected on occasions when he doesn't
yet have sufficient information.

@_author: Adam Back 
@_subject: Secure Phone:  Making man in the middle audible. 
Good.  Sounds as though this could work.  Much better than my stego
One minor point: if I was Mallet faced with the problem your solution
presents the MITM with I would compose a plan which used a whole row
of minimum sized packets (or small upward random variations).  That
would minimise the chance that I would have to wait to compose
packets.  Clearly you can fix this: you can insist on a certain
standard deviation, or whatever as part of the protocol.
Another point is that you are making the unstated assumption that you
can't stream packets.  That is, you are assuming that you must receive
the whole packet before you can start to resend decoded and
re-encoded.  Perhaps this is already the case anyway, I don't know
much about audio compression algorithms or codecs.  Eric can tell us
whether this will already be the case for his algorithm set.  If not,
I think it should be easy enough to enforce this property (immediate
solution which comes to mind: send the bits in a packet backwards!)
I'm wondering also whether you couldn't generalise the sort of
stretched interlock protocol which is going on here, with in your
solution the readers ears telling him something is wrong, to come up
with something where the firmware in Eric's fine box could detect
and just flip out of secure mode, or flash the leds, or whatever in
protest to indicate it had detected a MITM attempt.
Perhaps what you have already is enough -- if the inter-packet delay
gets longer than whatever you caculate as the highest possible time
which could normally happen you flag MITM.  If you can ensure that
transatlantic delays are lower than the delays MITM will introduce
with this protocol, you've got it covered.
Being paranoid, I still see a couple of dangers: - if the packets are quite small you may be able to have a neural net
setup fill in the gaps when the packets lengths arrive awkwardly for
the MITM without it sounding too strange.
- there is no guarantee of real-time, you can make something sound like
it is coming in real time when it has lag.  For example: if you insert
some throat clearing, or ponderous "errr".  Some peoples speech
patterns are that way already.
This second one causes me to suggest that you'd be safer to have the
box detect the MITM induced lag if you can, rather than rely on human
I'm going to think on this some more.

@_subject: What's really in PGP 5.5? 
I'm not sure I see why you draw this distinction.
Is it because the person sending may intend the message for Alice
only?  If so I think Jon said that all current versions of PGP warn
the user that their is a company escrow situation when you send to the
key (this information being in attributes of the key).
Snooping Alice's outgoing traffic, and snooping Alice's incoming
traffic are similarly little brotherish in my view.
If the company has an approval system for official statements (seems
reasonable, if it's a press release, important contractual decision,
etc), then Alice can send a copy to the legal beagles for the ok, and
they can send it on.
I figure this is fair game also... clearly they can see the traffic
coming into LAN and being delivered to Alice's mailbox.
I don't like it either.  But how is this so different from snooping on
what Alice sends.
I was arguing earlier that the way for the company to do archiving of
received encrypted email was for archive copy to be taken after the
employee has decrypted it.  The employee should be made aware that the
received email is being archived.

John Kelsey described the same system.
[adding hex passphrase digits exchanged via PGP to display digits]
See my other recent post in this thread... I think it doesn't work
because Mallet can recover the passphrase.  You must remember that
when Mallet is actively doing a MITM attack he knows the digits on the
display of each party.  With that info he can recover the passphrase
by subtracting.  Then he can give Alice the correct checksum for the
link A<->M and Bob the correct checksum for the link M<->B.

@_subject: do NOT escrow communications keys (Re: What's really in PGP 5.5?) 
You're misunderstanding what I'm saying.  There was some other context
around the above quote.
What I'm saying is that you don't use the *email in transit* for
storage.  You receive the email, then you archive it (store it in your
eudora folder), then you consider it storage.  Perhaps with your
current software you archive the PGP encrypted email.  This is a bad
security practice.  You should have different, storage only keys for
encrypted archives.
Email in transit isn't that reliable.
About the only example of email in transit being considered storage
was a USENET article years ago by someone who considered it a kewl
hack that he had some games or something else which was in breach of
policy in his account and rumor went around that the admin was having
a purge.  He tarred, gzipped & uuencoded the lot and emailed it to
himself down a _long_ ! fowarding path.  It came back to him around 3
days later after the purge.  That's the kind of thing I mean when I
say you don't consider email storage.
I'm arguing that you should not backup, or escrow communications keys,
and that you should backup storage keys.
(Separately I have argued in the past that you should use forward
secrecy to ensure that you have no long term private keys which after
the fact allow you to decrypt traffic -- if a competitor, or the feds
get a copy of this key, your past traffic is vulnerable.  Encrypting
the session key to two long term keys, never mind one, makes this
situation even worse, and also results in a system useable for GAK.)
Your lawyers have a good point.  I know a few examples where people
really wish that email hadn't been kept around, as an email sent with
1 minutes thought has been dug up and used somewhat out of context as
the basis of a court case.
A pgp signed email is even worse.  There you have transferable
undeniable signature proving that you wrote the contested email.
I'm sure I've said this all before, but hey, maybe PGP has it's ears
open this time:
You should have two types of email.  "Official statement" type email,
which you might want to back up, and which you might want proof read
and approved by your company legal team, depending on how important it
is.  Official email you want to sign with a transferable signature
(normal pgp signature).
Unofficial email, for example to and fro communications between
co-developers at different companies, etc. you probably don't want
transferable signatures on.  (This is the kind of thing lawyers go
tut-tut about.)  So you use non-transferable signatures.  You use
forward secrecy, and for the really paranoid deliver it via mixmaster
to avoid mail delivery logs.  Archive if you wish.  It'll then be
largely one persons word against the other, as there will be little in
the way of proof of authorship.
It isn't based on the idea that you never want to store email.  That's
clearly bunk.  I've got 54Mb of old email on my disk.
What I'm arguing is that if you're going to encrypt your stored email
on your disk, that you should encrypt it with a storage key, and NOT a
communications key.  Communications keys should ideally be transient
(via forward secrecy), but failing that you should at least not have
multiple recipients to exarcerbate the problem.
Am I making sense?
I know I'm fighting against the tide .. but I'm confident that what
I'm saying is correct.

@_subject: authentication suggestion for secure phone (Re: computationally infeasible jobs for MITMs) 
There are two types of MITM attack:
i) the eavesdropper lets your voice go through
ii) the eavesdropper re-synthesizes your voice, or has two actors one
for Bob, one for Alice holding separate conversations
Your suggestion of having a CD playing in the back-ground only helps
against type i) MITM.  James's method of forcing the MITM to commit to
delivering packets with sizes which he can't deliver similarly only
applies to type i), as does my stego idea.
I think we stand a chance against type i).  Type ii) seems pretty hard
to stop by either manual cleverness (mixing in comments related to the
hash digits) or automated methods (such as James's or my earlier stego
I mean, heck, the actors could run two completely different
conversations, and weave into the conversation earlier topics covered
with Alice which they wanted to hear responses to, from Bob, and
vice-versa.  The MITM could potentially have as long as he wanted to
think of something clever to say to sound consistent with a comment
made by Alice or Bob relating to their hash digits.  Or he could
simply choose to omit saying anything related to hash digits.  They
could play different CDs, or no CDs, or go buy a copy of the CD, or
have a nice selection on tap as radio stations do (they seem to be
able to play any track with a couple of seconds notice).
I think the only real way to stop MITM to a paranoidly high degree of
certainty is to use authentication and web of trust.
Perhaps you can get a high enough degree of certainty for your
application with preventative measures against type i) MITM firm in
the belief that type ii) MITM is too difficult, or too expensive to
try against you.
I'm not sure it's even that expensive or difficult.  If I was a drug
king pin, or mafia, or military intelligence I wouldn't feel safe with
these approaches alone.  I'd want separate authentication.
Probably another kind of attack would be dangerous too: if the
attacker re-routes my phone call or hi-jacks it prior to set up of
secure comms.  Without authentication I could have a convesation with
a spook instead of Bob Gotti and not know it.  Alice need never know I
called, or may simultaneously, or some time afterwards have a call
from another spook with faked ANI.
Persistence authentication suggestion:
I can see one strong protection feature which isn't currently built in
to Eric's phone which could be, should be I think.  Shouldn't be that
hard to do.
You have the situation currently that you call Bob's number to go
secure, then have a conversation.  Well if you make several calls to
Bob with the first call being MITM free, because the MITM hadn't
singled you out for investigation yet, no use of this fact is made to
reduce the MITM's chance of succeeding next time.
(People who know some about SSH protocols may be guessing what's
coming next).
A way to use the fact that you have had one or more non-MITM'd calls
is for the unit to remember the number and exchange a secret with the
called unit inside the encryption envelope.
The next time you call the same unit (as defined by calling the same
phone number), you use the shared secret to authenticate the call.  If
the other unit can't do this, you get suspicious.
You could do better than using the phone number: you could have the
units exchange public El Gamal or DSA keys (bearing in mind Eric's
understandable avoidance of RSA).  When you call up a unit you first
send it a nonce to sign with it's EG/DSA key.  It signs it and sends
you it's public key.
If you already have the public key, you check that the signature
matches.  If you don't have the public key, you save it for next time.
You probably want to assign the public key some human meaningful value
that can be displayed on the display.  If you have no input device, I
guess a sequence number would do.  (First secured phone you ever call
is called user 1, etc).
Then the user can write down who he thinks each caller is caller
1. Black Unicorn, 2. Lucky Green. 3. Tim May, etc.  You could even
slap a sticker on top of the box with a few places to enter this
In addition this feature means that you can secure one communication
with a PGP emailed table of key words to lookup hash digits and speak
words.  After that secured communication all further communications
are also authenticated.
If you don't use a PGP secured email, well you still have
authenticated that you are at least talking to a persistent MITM.
This in itself is useful, because the MITM may make mistakes, or you
may arrange to call from different numbers arranged by out of band
communications.  If you once get a different key, you get suspicious,
as the once could be the only time you got through to the real Bob, as
opposed to the MITM.
Another way to authenticate yourself would be if you met face-to-face
with someone you plan to use the phone with in an office with an
internal switch board, or with a test rig such as Eric has to
demonstrate his phones.  (How easy would it be to have the units
directly plugable -- plug them together, plug a phone in talk make
secured call, remember or write down that user 3 is Tim May.
I like this use of persistence authentication.  What do you think
Another method, which could be used in addition would be for Eric to
install an additional key into the units, and certify that key.  If
the sale is in person, perhaps you could even personalise them with
the users name & dob or something unique (users choice).  At least
that way Eric gets to profit from the MITM/spooks as they've got to
buy a unit to get a certified key :-)
Course it makes Eric, or Eric's laptop, a _fat_ target, but would be
cheaper than including full web of trust certification capability, and
could add some utility.
Anyway, I like the persistence authentication idea.  And I'd encourage
Eric to build it in.
Now officially an EAR violation...

@_subject: secure phone on a PCI card? (Re: authentication suggestion for secure phone) computationally infeasible jobs for MITMs) 
If it cost a lot extra, that could be a problem, yes.  I am unclear on
how much extra this would cost.  Apart from an EEPROM, it's a protocol
and software update right?
Use an EEPROM?
For individuals perhaps.  For military intelligence or mafia boss type
uses perhaps not.  Or perhaps not for lower security apps too: buy a small landline phone
to use as a handset, carry your box with you every where you go, never
let it out of your sight, move around a lot, hotel rooms, anywhere
else random you can get a phone jack socket.  I reckon there would be
potential clients who might fit this life-style.
On the cost front, I am interested as to thoughts on how easy it would
be for Eric to put one of his phones on a PCI card, or PCMCIA card.
Presumably you could make some major cost savings in this way, in that
you could potentially use the computers modem, memory, processor.
PGP Inc's pgpfone I think is sort of compatible with Eric's phone.
However pgpfone audio quality _sucks_.  (Admittedly one end was using
a 14.4k modem when I tried it -- but it was _terrible_, even no
encryption was fairly bad).
I think Eric's phone uses a 14.4k modem chip (or lower?) so it's not
the bit rate as such, but more the lack of higher quality audio
compression codecs which are possible in hardware.  (Right?)  Also the fact that with PGPfone you're using PC speakers, and room
microphone probably makes it seem worse than it could be.
A socket to plug a phone into to act as a speaker/microphone would be
a good start, plus the audio codec part of the Eric's hardware.
Now what do you reckon you could get the price of that down to?
How would that work out with a PCMCIA card... I'm thinking of laptops using
GSM mobile phones data links, what would the audio quality be like over the
9600 bit data rate over a GSM mobile phone? If it could work it would be
neat as you'd have a fully mobile secure phone.  Better than Jim McCoy's
cell phone strapped to his laptop: secure phone PCMCIA card in one PCMCIA
slot, PCMCIA modem in the other slot, mobile phone plugged into PCMCIA
modem, al-cheapo phone handset plugged into secure phone PCMCIA card. Tangle of wires, but still neat.  Pity GSM phones don't have audio in, and
mike out jack sockets, which get selected when you plug in the data lead,
or you could use the GSM phone handset.
Course adding the whole lot to a GSM phone would be even neater, but
then that'd get expensive again.  Wonder how much functionality could
be borrowed from components already present for the normal GSM phone
hardware, and how much saving you could get from that.

@_subject: do NOT escrow communications keys 
It's getting difficult to speak English around here, what with the
GAKkers redefining the terms and issuing updates to the NewSpeak
dictionary every month or so.
"escrow" already meant an object kept safe for one's own benefit.  Or
it did, until the GAKkers perverted it, and redefined it's meaning to
be backdoor for another person or organisations benefit
(government/spook benefit in their case).
Key recovery sounds like the process of using your backup plan to
recover keys.  You would think it means a plan to recover your keys in
case you have a hard disk crash or whatever.  Again for your own
benefit.  But no, with another new edition of the newspeak dictionary
it suddenly means backdoor, master key for government or other
organisation to access your communications.
(I also might admit to a small amount of hyperbole, "dastardly evil
government/spook/TLA master backdoor access" as compared to "backing
up your hard disk now and then is a good idea".  But hey, that's the
way I feel about it.)
Thank you.  With the obvious caveat that any given user may not want
this, but that if you are holding information for other people, that
is the information is other peoples valuable property, and the machine
belongs to that other person too, then you might find it useful to
give them a copy of the storage encryption key in case of disaster.
In fact if they are employing you, and the machine is theirs they
might reasonably insist upon it.  You clearly have the option not to
store your own private information on the machine.  In fact your
employee may have policies discouraging you from doing so.
The point about using the terms "data backup" and "data recovery", is
that it attempts to highlight the falacy of the fundamental
misconception buzzing around, as a result of the lastest issue of the
newspeak dictionary released from DC, that it is "essential and in
companies interests to be able to recover transient messages".  This
is bogus.  What is important is recovering DATA (using your backup
tapes to "recover" your data, when you have a disk crash).
Jon Callas' attempted invocation of the "key recovery bad" / "data
recovery good" mantra, was somewhat amusing in that he _was_ arguing
for data recovery, whilst implementing key recovery (or at least
transient communication message recovery).
The legal beagles at your company will decide a policy for you
designed to minimise your companies chances of being sued over the
contents of your communications, and hence losing it's shareholders
No, it's a solution to a problem.  It's a solution to the problem that
Tim just explored in more detail, and one that I gave a few short
comments upon in one of my posts in this thread.
If your company can't be proven to have authored a document, it
reduces the value of that the document to an opponent doing attempting
to do creative legal work and create a headache for you company when
your archives are requested in a discovery process.
Don't think so.  It's simple enough technology.
Yes it'll need special archival software; but you're providing an
integrated business solution right.  PGP Inc's (are you a PGP
employee?), already includes a number of components.  Key server, SMTP
policy enforcer, PGP for business.  I might also point out that the current PGP for CAKware (pgp5.5)
solution also has the same problem.  Just because the message is
encrypted to a second recipient, is no guarantee that the user is
archiving it for you.
Say the user receives some email which is hot, hot, hot, and
immediately purges it from the received folder on eudora, or netscape,
or PGP for business.  So, now what good is your CAKware going to do
for you?  You don't have the message.  Therefore you have the same
problem if you wish to guarantee access to messages.
Look, I'm not in favour of CAK, or GAK, or any other snoopy business,
PGP are the ones arguing for that.
What I'm proposing is that firstly you don't encourage people to do
it.  But, if you're convinced that people will shop elsewhere unless
you do provide archival facilities readable by the company, and
snooping facilities, I'm arguing that you ought to do it in such a way
that the resulting system isn't useful for _Government_ access to
So given that set of criteria I think it's entirely reasonable to say
to clients who demand encrypted user archival:
- You'll need new email clients on all your desks
And reasonable to tell clients who demand that the archive be central,
(to prevent users deleting archived messages that don't suit them)
- You'll need to buy the LAN archive server module also
I also think it's entirely reasonable to tell clients who demand
- you're little brotherish SOBs
- the client will send your LAN archiver a copy after the user has decrypted
- the client will send you a copy of sent email prior to encryption
So, to answer:
He won't forget: it will be integrated into pgp5.6 "for business for
people who don't like GAK" PGP mail clients.
Well they're going to have to learn how to use pgp5.6, but frankly
it's just as easy to use as pgp5.0 for personal security.
Oh come on, I think PGP Inc will be able to hack it.  Most of the
design I already worked out for them in the last few posts.
And there's the rub.  What comes first: profits, or selling out to the
US government.
I'm sorry, but I think PGP has sold out on this one.
You can justify most of the aspects of the system I outlined in terms
of security.  It is more secure.  Using forward secrecy is more secure
again, and imposes the same restrictions anyway.  You can therefore
use the line:
- you want to marginally easier to integrate snooping at the expense
  of security?
- what if your competitors also get to read your communications?
Also, might carry some weight:
- PGP is the standard solution, it doesn't work that way, for security
  reasons.  If you use competitors products which do work that way,
  you'll be unable to communicate with the rest of the world

@_subject: PGP CAKware & IETF controlled Open-PGP standard 
One aspect of PGP's controversial CAK system in pgp5.5 that I have not
seen discussed is the standardisation aspects.
How does the introduction of corporate access to keys (CAK), and
government access to keys (GAK) features fit into the IETF framework?
Are PGP Inc's CAK features intended to be part of the now IETF
controlled Open-PGP standard?
What is the IETF's stance on politics having influence on security?
A weakly comparable example might be perhaps the IPSEC standardisation
process, and the effect of export regulations on key sizes.  Are IPSEC
key sizes allowed to be restricted in the standards so that IPSEC
products can be exportable?
Now some would argue, and with some justification, that emails sent
using company equipment are the property of that company.  However
there are other considerations also.  Expectation of privacy is one.
The negative aspects of a society in which most companies have become
little brother institutions, becoming small versions of what many of
us are fighting: mandatory government access to keys, big brother
wanting the ability to read all traffic.
I would be somewhat concerned if PGP Inc's recently announced the key
escrow functionality becomes part of the Open-PGP standard, because it
will set a bad precedent, and possibly force others who would
otherwise wish to implement to the open-PGP standard to also implement
features useful to secret service special interests in enforcing
mandatory domestic government access to keys, or implement only partly
compatible systems.
I need hardly comment that such an eventuality is not in the interests
of the internet community.
Specific questions relating to the standard are perhaps:
- Are the certificate flags informing the recipient that
  communications to a key is escrowed, and that email which is not
  encrypted to the escrow key will be bounced expected to be part of the
  Open PGP standard.
- Can a conforming application ignore the key escrow flags?
- Or must a conforming application display a suitable warning perhaps
  such as:
    WARNING: the person whose key you are using has the misfortune of
    being forced to use software supplied by a company which has sold
    out to key escrow, therefore you data may be read by others than
    your intended recipient.
  and perhaps a note tacked on to the email for the recipient to read:
    SAY NO TO KEY ESCROW.  Boycot little brother and big brother.
    Don't buy PGP Inc software.
  or must conforming applications be more polite.
Aside from the snide remarks about key escrow, I am concerned about
PGP's actions harming internet privacy, and helping indirectly the
introduction of mandatory key escrow which the US administration and
UK secret service and department of trade and industry are pushing.
A system which implements all the features necessary for mandatory key
escrow as a business solution may indirectly help the mandatory key
escrow proponents.  Plausible events which might happen in such an
event might be:
- companies encouraged to use (or penalised for not using) open-PGP
  corporate escrow compatible systems
- service providers also encouraged to use such systems
- companies legally required to use such systems, and hand copies of
  corporate master keys to government (corporate escrow then becomes
  government escrow for business communications)
- ISPs and individuals legally required to use such systems, and hand
  copies of corporate master keys to government (full blown mandatory
  key escrow)
I am concerned about the possibility that the IETF might be steered by
PGP Inc into putting features into the Open-PGP standard which are not
in the interests of the internet community.

@_subject: message recovery is a red herring: pgp5.5 is for snooping (Re: CAK as a really bad form of corporate networking) 
I'm finding this whole thing is surrounded by euphemisms, and
newspeak.  For example PGP's Jon Callas claiming that the main
motivation for the system is to ensure availability of messages.  As
you point out this is bunk.
This leaves as the only excuse for pgp5.5's existance corporate
snooping of sent and received emails.  PGP Inc is encouraging little
brother and doing it in a way that provides tools for big brother, and
is thereby paving the way for mandatory GAK.
(Also Jon's flimsly claim that it isn't a "key escrow" system, I
consider mere word play, whatever PGP Inc cares to call it, it's
clearly a CAK system).
Perhaps my arguments of how you can build encrypted corporate snooping
email archive systems without being GAK friendly are too complex.
Just storing the data in the clear is easier to understand, and is
probably what most corporates are doing anyway.  I don't think most
corporates are using storage encryption widely internal to their
networks, and rely on a decent firewall, or an air gap.
The obvious objection to the argument that you store your email
folders in the clear, as I'm sure one of our anonymous PGP employees
will point out again, is that:
A similar objection applies to IMAP mailboxes, (IMAP being a POP3 like
thing, but with the added functionality that the mailbox archive is
kept on the server).
If you're using PGP mail client software too, it can archive it in
plain text, or encrypted with a corporate escrowed storage key as I
was describing.  Mostly mega-important email is going to be copies of
stuff on disk anyway, as Tim points out.
(Also I'd like to ask those who use other email clients than I how encrypted
email is treated: with emacs mailcrypt, I have the option of archiving the
decrypted email, or keeping the encrypted mail as is in the archive, so that
you have to go back and decrypt it again to read old encrypted emails.  How
does the eudora plug in work?  How does pgp5.0 work, and how does netscape
with pgp plug in work.)
To me a corporate snooping policy is not a good thing to encourage.
I wonder if PGP Inc claim that corporate snooping is demanded by the
Another way to implement corporate message snooping is for the company
to retain copies of users private decryption keys.  (Plus to have the
second crypto recipient on sent mail of the company snoop, but strip
it off before it goes outside the LAN in the SMTP policy enforcer.)
Still that's more GAKware, as if you remove the policy enforcer it's
useful for GAKkers also.

What's the difference betwen storing public keys and private keys?
Are you concerned that someone will tamper with the unit and replace
the keys.  (Borrow the phone while you're out, reset the EEPROM, and
make a series of calls to put in MITM keys.)  Could be dangerous.
You could use a pin, but then you need an input device.
However, you could also argue that if someone can borrow your phone
for a while they can give it free "upgrade", and replace the RNG, or
whatever anyway, so it doesn't make any difference?  I don't think it
I kind of liked the persistency authentication idea as a candidate for
your remote upgrade.  You could do it with symmetric keys or with
asymmetric keys.  It's just a trade off which depends on how many keys
you're allowing.  If space is short, you could do something more
clever, say:
- Exchange (and store in a table) a symmetric key with each new phone
- Lookup keys by phone number (or unit serial number if you don't have ANI)
- Authenticate using nonce and stored key.
Overhead: 16 bytes per phone
Allow say 50 callers = 800 bytes.  Perhaps you want a button to push
(hold go secure down for over 5 seconds, say) to store a caller in
this table.  (Prevents attacker flushing your table by making a load
of dud calls).  Or perhaps just wrap around and discard least used
numbers/serial numbers.
Fancy organising this cheap hardware hack?  I reckon you'd get a few
buyers.  I'll pledge to buy 3 at a reasonable price.  Do you have the software for PCs/MACs?  Would this cheap hardware hack
work with PGPfone as is?  (PGP Inc don't seem to be doing much work on
PGPfone right now).
btw the hardware hack I presume is impedance matching to allow phone
to plug into 3.5mm jack audio and mic socket?  Any hardware people
care to give soldering instructions?
GSM laptop secure phone, here we come :-)
I'm not sure what PGPfone's problem is, but when I tried it, it
sounded like an off tune radio station, but worse.  Even turning off
encryption entirely (to preserve the precious cycles for the audio
codec) didn't help much.
Perhaps I should retry it now with 166Mhz K5 pentium in place of
120Mhz AMD 486 at the time.
It's a damn, damn, shame that no-one is doing this.
We couldn't bribe you to do it next could we?
I was kind of figuring that eventually we'll get there with a bit of
software because cellular phones and laptops functionality will merge,
and the bandwidth and processing power will be there.  Still a laptop
with your hardware hack, would be ok for now.

@_subject: non-transferable & designated verifier signatures 
Wuw.  Don't go away will you Monty?  That was an excellent point.
The application you describe could be catered for very well by a third
type of signature called a designated verifier signature.  With this
type of signature you can designate when you create the signature who
can verify it.  DV signatures are different than non-transferable
signatures in that in addition to being not transferable to
non-verifiers, you can't transfer them without revealing your private
key.  The other difference being that you can construct them for other
verifiers (the arbitration service).
Non-transferable signatures on the other hand work by being made
forgeable by the recipient.  That way it is essentially the recipients
word against the senders.  However there is some transferable proof
there: there is proof that _one_ of you wrote it.
So DV signatures are probably the best of the two.  Merely being able
to demonstrate enough proof to cause an argument about which of you
wrote the document costs you the compromise of your private key.
Also you could clearly cope with the arbitrator situation without
resorting to DV signatures; non-transferable signatures would be
enough, if you sent a signed message to Alice, and a detached
signature to your abitrator.  If you want to later use the abitrator,
you send the body of the message to the arbitrator.  He calculates the
hash of the message, and is then able to use the detatched
non-transferable signature to verify your claim.  But he can't
demonstrate this to other people.  One disadvantage is that the
arbitrator could team up with you and make that two peoples words
against one.  You might see that as an advantage, but Alice won't.  An
arbitrator which indulged in this kind of behaviour may lose
Lastly, some comments along the lines of `smart contracts' as
discussed by Nick Szabo in the past.  It would be nicer if you didn't
need the arbitrator.
One way to do this for some kinds of situations is for each party to
setup a atomic transfer where they give each other the ability to
cause a penalty to be extracted from both of them.
Say they are engaging in some business worth $100.  Alice is
performing some programming task for Bob.
If Bob is satisfied with the software he gives Alice the $100.  If he
is not he incurs a $50 loss himself which goes to charity, and Alice
does also.  In doing this he doesn't get the software.  But Alice is
penalised, and it is better than losing $100.
Problem with that example is that you still need an arbitrator
probably.  Unless perhaps Bob is able to determine quality without
source code, or with part of source code.

@_subject: Why corporate message recovery IS gak compliant (Re: Why Corporate Message Recovery isn't GAK) 
I won't even bother dealing indivdually with your arguments to this
one because you have just demonstrated again your ability to
simultaneously focus on hair splitting trivia, and ignore the whole
crux of the argument.
Suffice to say that it is not the details of the GAK (government
access to keys) system that the US government has tried to coerce
people to use that makes people not like it.  It's what it means: it
means that government will have access to keys.
We have had what some people term Clipper I through Clipper IV (or is
that V)?  The details and the names change each time.  And were you to
be their spokesperson you would be explaining in intricate detail how
"key recovery" is not "key escrow" and how therefor it is ok, and we
should all accept it.
The argument against pgp 5.5 is that it does 3 things wrong:
1. it is GAK compliant; it provides a ready to roll GAK system for the
US administration to try to leverage into place and switch on
2. it attempts to provide escrow features for transient communications
3. it doesn't differentiate between storage keys (which should be
escrowed to protect encrypted information stored on hard disks and
backup tapes) and transient communications keys which should if
anything be securely wiped after use
I'm glad that you acknowledge the very real problem.
I notice that none of your reasons are technical.  I take this to be a
tacit acknowledgment that you have indeed built a GAK compliant system
with pgp5.5.
Let's have a look at these balances to see how comforting they are
given the lack of technical protection (being a cypherpunks I like
technical protections, they are so much more useful and concrete than
words of assurance):
Why would they have to buy the company?  They would just introduce
legislation to enforce _use_ of a feature you have already
thoughtfully included.  (A couple of people speculated that this early
GAK compliance may be the result of PGP Inc corporate investor
pressure (the share holder is god), or perhaps high level management
decision that this allows an easy route for PGP whatever the outcome
of the GAK wars: mandatory GAK PGP wins with it's early compliance, if
mandatory GAK loses, well PGP continues to cash in PRZ's reputation,
and PGP Inc's business client base).
My question to you is what is PGP Inc going to do when becomes illegal
to sell software which doesn't include mandatory GAK?  What're you all
going to do?  Break the law?  It'll be too late by then, unless you
have a corporate contingency plan of moving to Switzerland.  Do you?
The company would survive with staff replacement.  Especially with
mandatory GAK as the regime.
No problem.  They'll just pay higher wages with the huge government
sell-out dividend reaped by being a early GAK adopter (via GAK
Stopping the OpenPGP process doesn't sound necessary, if I read your
other post correctly PGP Inc would like to persuade the IETF to put

You might like to consider this thought also:
Even if you personally believe that PGP Inc will stall at mandatory
GAK, and cease trading rather than do it, or even if you personally
will resign (I can't see that anyone's resignation helps us after the
This is a BAD thing.  You could prevent that.  But you're not, you're
helping it head to fruition.  You will have to live with your
conscience if GAK happens through this route.
Mr linux hacker will figure it out.  Mr windows user won't.  There are
more Mr windows users.
This game isn't about Mr crypto-anarchist, linux hacker, it's about
mass market software, about what individuals and companies are using.
The spooks know they can't stop "live free or die" types using
steganography even after mandatory GAK.
Won't make it any less painful for those who don't have the nerve or
technical expertise.
I would say that I am not trying to be vindictive, or anything here,
but you are _so_ easy to criticize, and I am trying to do what I can
to encourage PGP to salvage the situation.

@_subject: PGP CAKware & IETF controlled Open-PGP standard 
I may be misunderstanding something here, but could you tell me how
PGP freeware and PGP personal privacy can simultaneously not have
recognition of GAK compliant keys, and emit messages telling the users
that this is a GAK key (on receipt of the flag you described), and
emit messages warning the user that the email will not be delivered
(on receipt of that other flag you described).
If it's defined as being compliant to ignore both of these flags, and
the message snooping key then users email will bounce without warning.
If it's defined to silently send to second crypto recipient, you have
fully interoperable GAK compliance built in to the core of PGP.  If
PGP Inc will remove the GAK compliance when GAK becomes mandatory, I'm
sure there are other companies who won't have a problem selling out to
GAK (eg IBM, or TIS).
If it's defined to warn but give the option to send to second crypto
recipient, well you've still got mandatory GAK compliance, but you've
got a pretty little warning that you've got mandatory GAK to rub your
nose in the fact for each message you send too.
I'd be interested to see some discussion of how this will work out,
following up to the specific examples I give above.
No switching to genaralities this time; please answer: how is it going
to work?  I fear you can't have your CMR setup in pgp5.5 and not be
GAK compliant.  If you can think of a way that you can modify it to
break this dependency, I'd be interested to hear it.  If you can't
demonstrate such a change I would argue strongly for it not even being
a MAY.  I'd argue for GAK compliancy not to go into the IETF OpenPGP
I gave lots of examples of other ways to achieve the claimed
functionality of recovering stored data.  Achieving hard to circumvent
corporate email snooping functionality is harder to achieve without
CMR.  You can do some, but not quite as much.  But corporate snooping
wasn't on your stated list of user requirements.  And it's not very
savory anyway.

[bucko big snip]
Well, it was a nice rant, Jon.  Most of it was even crypto-correct :-)
But the problem is you didn't address the point causing your perceived
hostilities.  Not once.
The point is Jon "GAK compliance meister" Callas, you're building in
GAK compliance.
Now we know that it is possible for you to have GAK compliance without
using it for that purpose, or at least to promise that at this stage,
promise sincerely even, it doesn't make any difference.  When
mandatory GAK is law, all you'll have done is to smooth the way for
it.  Your promises, and crypto-anarchic 'tudes won't amount to a stack
of cards.
Your wimpy sounding safegaurds and reasons why PGP Inc would have to
be bought out, all staff sacked etc. don't sound very reassuring.
Saying "over my dead body", doesn't really help us if we are realistic
enough to figure that you'll be dead, and we'll have GAK.  Personally
I'd sooner we didn't have GAK (and that y'all lived too).
Oh yeah, and the reason we're all "picking on you" is nothing,
absolutely nothing what-so-ever, to do with the fact that PGP is an
"Inc" now.
The reason that it appears to you that we're picking on you is that
we're trying to ram a few simple points through your skulls which we
consider may be significant points in the political wars potentially
leading up to mandatory GAK.
For example, major point  that by attempting to enforce GAK
compliance on the IETF OpenPGP standard you will make it easier, much
easier, major point this, listening?, much easier to introduce GAK,
because they can then do so interoperably with the OpenPGP standard,
which you're hoping will be  internet email application used by
netscape like 80% market dominance figures.
PGP Inc has easily within it's powers the ability to remove this easy
migration path for manditory GAK.
Point  is more of a technical point really: you seem to be mixing
key functionality to the detriment of security to provide a fully
functional corporate email snooping service.  Here's a meme to pass
around the office: This is also fairly important, as keys have different recovery
requirements, and different life time requirements.  Re-using
communication encryption keys for storage keys causes all sorts of
problems.  One of which is getting shouted at for being GAK compliant.
Oh yes, and email in your received folder is NOT a communication
anymore, it is now _stored_, and should therefore, if it is encrypted
be encrypted with said storage key.
Now, if y'all over there are such "live free or die" crypto-anarchist
martyr's that you've given up your cisco options, and taken a pay cut,
and resisted temptation for a 20% pay rise (and you very well may be
die hard crypto-anarchists for all I know, I've only met a few of
you), surely argument  means something to you:
   "attempting to enforce GAK compliance on the IETF OpenPGP
    standard you will make it MUCH easier for USG to introduce GAK"
So what's your problem, if skipping on a 20% pay rise isn't a problem,
why do you have to implement GAK compliance to provide small amounts
of additional functionality for corporate snooping, which isn't even
on your stated user requirement list.  As I demonstrated you could if
you figure this is necessary to the future of free crypto (though I
can't see that it is), implement most of the snooping functionality
without GAK compliance.  It's not as if people can't hack around the
whole damn caboodle anyway, as was stated as a plus point in earlier
PGP person post.  So why GAK compliance for that last couple of % of
enforceability on snooping.  Think of the lower enforceability as a
boon, you've got a technical reason to use to explain to little
brother why 100% snooping doesn't work that well without 24 hr video
cams surveillance and NSA style body cavity searches at the door.
I'd suggest you print the above document out and have a discussion of
it.  Get PRZ there too.  Let us all know the decision so we know
whether to start investing in stego applications in preparation for
fast-track inadvertently (being generous here, since your whinge) PGP
Inc assisted GAK.
And hang-loose, don't get up-tight, just say no to GAK compliance.

You are adopting a narrow technical meaning of key escrow.  Key escrow
also has another meaning in common parlance: third party access to
communications.  Now I know this common parlance isn't technically
accurate, but "key escrow" itself is a piece of newspeak, a clever
term coined by secret service / government spin doctors.  It has
entered the language like it or not (I don't like it).  This common
parlance meaning is probably more widely understood and used than the
technical meaning you are using.
With that in mind, you may start to see why people, such as Schneier,
and others over the last few days have been telling you "you're
picking nits".
Point is pgp 5.5 allows other people to have access to your
communications.  Your SMTP policy enforcer even attempts to enforce
this.  You also described a feature whereby an administrator could
remotely configure and restrict functionality in pgp 5.5 mail client
(I am unclear as to whether this allows the admin to enforce snoop
access or not).
Your own term CMR (Corporate Message Recovery) isn't that accurate a
description itself, it's a bit of a euphamism at best.  What you're
recovering is transient communications which don't need recovering
anyway.  What PGP is really up to is enforcing capability for
Corporate Message Snooping.
[line breaks were _all over_ the shop, I've reformatted]
First point, which I'm getting bored of repeating: keys have different
uses.  Storage keys, transient communications keys, signature keys.
You're using one key for all 2 functions; that is the root of your
problems and dilemmas.  You're using what should be a storage key to
receive transient communications, then you're proceeding to wonder why
this causes you to have the undesirable situation of having a GAK
compliant system (or more properly trying and failing to argue that
you don't have one).
You know, what they're doing: it's not so bad for data encrypted on
their disks.  They can acheive the departmental level escrow to
distribute risk just the same with this form of escrow.
You don't need to escrow transient communications keys at all anyway.
Your pgp 5.5 isn't going to help recover the actual data of value, all
those stored CAD files...  You know why?  Because they're on the disk,
not in transit in the email system.  So you haven't solved the claimed
If you want to do something about the claimed problem work out some
secret splitting solutions to better distribute trust for escrowed
storage keys.  (Now this is a real use for escrow: the company is safe
guarding it's own encrypted data on disks and tapes for it's own
Nope, your responsibility should be to solve their problems.  (Which
as I show above you have not done.)  Actually your responsibility to
live up to the reputation PRZ transfered to PGP Inc dictates that you
should also do what you can do not build systems which help GAKkers.
Instead your responsibility appears increasingly to produce systems
which smooth the way for coming mandatory GAK by implementing systems
which are GAK ready.
Or if you deny that one, at least you are weakening your
communications security for practically no gain.
Yeah, OK, you don't seem to be managing very well :-)
(Sorry, you asked for it.  I don't actually mean to be rude, I would
just like to get the points across, and to influence PGP to recover
gracefully from this tactical and reputational mistake.)
This is why I was asking above about separate signing keys.  They
surely don't need to stick the signature keys in the safe!!!  In fact
it is counter-productive even for hard-nosed corporate lawyers, and
$$$ driven scruple-short company execs: if they can't prove an
employee penned something they can't use this to prove a case against
him.  If they've got a copy of the signature key, they can forge
signatures which makes signatures useless in litigation involving
company and employee.
It's all screwey because you've got key functionality which belongs in
different keys mixed up.
You should have 3 types of key:
1. signature keys
2. transient encryption keys
3. storage keys
The signature keys you never escrow.  You certify.  If something goes
wrong you re-issue, release revocation cert, and re-certificate.
The transient encryption keys are for communications, you delete them
immediately after use.  Yes I'm talking forward secrecy here.  If you
don't like forward secrecy, well at least don't escrow the encryption
Storage keys you make damn sure you can recover.  You escrow these for
real.  Company safe sounds about right.  Secret splitting could be
nice also.
There is no advantage; the systems are approximately equivalent in
flexibility of architecture.  You can acheive the exact same
architecture with key escrow; just escrow the keys with your backup
You shouldn't be recovering transient messages, you should be
recovering stored data.

@_subject: IETF policy on refusing to allow politics to weaken protocols (Re: Why Adam Back keeps politicizing technical issues) 
Williams title being: `Why Adam Back keeps politicizing technical
I would like to comment that the reason politics are arising in
discussion of communications security issues is a natural consequence
of the fact that it's a damn political topic.  Ignore the politics and
you may implement a mandatory GAK system, or at least a GAK compliant
one.  Actually I also argue that there are technical security reasons
why the CMR approach offers weaker security.  I've gone over these
reasons already in this thread, so I won't repeat them.
IETF I think has a stated policy (at least this is the case for the
IPSEC standardisation discussions I have been intermittently
following) to not allow politics to weaken it's protocols and
algorithm choices.  PGP Inc introducing GAK compliance at the cost of
security is a clear case where this policy should be kicking in.
You will note that I didn't say this.  In fact I spent half of last
night detailing alternate less GAK friendly ways for PGP Inc to
provide corporate message snooping, the very functionality which is
the motivation for their CMR.  Perhas you were not reading.
What I did say, and it appears to be a meme which didn't stick with
you as I'm sure I raised this in a previous post replying to you is:
Key functionality should be separated: in the same way that you have
separate signature and encryption keys, because of the differences
between appropriate backup policies, security implications, and
life-times, you should have separate email receipt encryption keys and
storage keys.  Transient email receipt keys should not be escrowed,
but for security reasons perhaps should even be securely wiped after
As an additional security bonus: storage keys can be symmetric (where
they are for your own use) which avoids the more less certain and
more quickly sliding target of public key lengths.
I will guess that the reason this meme doesn't suit you is that it's
not the way your OS/2 pgp mail client plugins work, and therefore not
yet part of your mindset.  So perhaps it's not the status quo for your
and some other apps to use separate storage keys for archiving and
receiving encrypted mail; but there are clear security advantages to
doing it this way.
There is are some clear differences: 1. You can visually see multiple crypto recipients in most PGP enabled
MUAs, as they usually correspond to email CC fields.
2. PGP Inc is attempting to weakly enforce this special purpose
message snooping recipient embedded into the key certificate.
3. PGP Inc even has (less clear on details here) I think from Jon
Callas first post: pgp 5.5 client which enforces inclusion on sent
mail as controlled by a remote company message snooping czar &
enforced inclusion on received mail by the SMTP policy enforcer.
4. There is a difference between what you or I may knock up in
scripts, and what PGP Inc attempts to persuade the IETF include as
conformancy requirements, and what PGP does implement ahead of the
standardisation process.
5. The IETF process should be accepting proposed designs and deciding
on the best ones, which PGP Inc, and the other suppliers would then go
and implement.  As it is now, as William Allen Simpson just pointed
out, PGP Inc is cruising ahead implementing, and deploying things
without bothering with the OpenPGP process.
Your point about using normal multiple recipient to provide snooping
is a good one.  It would be a much less GAK friendly solution for PGP
Inc to encrypt to a second recipient without any message snooping
flags encoded into the PGP standard.  That way email clients won't
reply to this second recipient, and users won't have an automated
snooping feature embeded in their PGP for personal privacy, or
competitor re-write of the same compliant OpenPGP app, for someone
else's benefit (recipient company, or government).
To snoop received email, it provides similar amounts of snooping
enforcement if the recipient's PGP 5.5 for business client when the
user decrypts re-encrypts to a storage key that the company does have
escrowed, or where there is a second crypto recipient in the storage.
(Talking mail folders here.)
See above.  The objectionable new feature in PGP5.5 (and apparently
pgp5.0 too without our realisation to this point) is enforcement in
senders clients to support message snooping, in a form which can
easily be used to interoperate with GAK, and thereby prepares
everyones OpenPGP compliant email client to enforce GAK against them.
At the very most the maximum acknowledgement that it seems reasonable
to me for OpenPGP to have of the GAK compliancy feature is to flag
this key and allow the user to send to this recipient at their option.
In addition I am arguing that PGP Inc are doing the Internet community
a major disservice by choosing to implement message snooping in this
way.  Much better, less controversial, and more secure to do the
snooping in the pgp5.5 client after decryption.  That doesn't need to
involve changes to the message spec.  PGP Inc's SMTP policy enforcer
could then be changed in functionality to stripping off the company
snooping crypto recipient field before it leaves the LAN for security
I already did this half a dozen times.  I'm not fear mongering, I'm
attempting to point out the dangers of including GAK compliancy.  And
to point out the opportunity to make PGP non-GAK compliant, and
thereby frustrate mandatory GAK proponents.  PGP is trying to discard
this opportunity, when there are clear alternate methods which can be
argued are more secure, better meet PGP's Jon Callas's stated user
requirements, don't support GAK, and don't require modifications to
the standard.

William Geiger  again:
Neither did I.  But the question at hand is whether the IETF OpenPGP
should recognize them.
I'd argue that it's more than just not necessary, having the
information in the public key is the sole reason I'm arguing that this
is a GAK compliant feature.
Not very intuitive to the user though is it.  Also not a very strongly
optional feature if 80% of businesses end up bouncing your mail back
at you because you're "choosing" not to be GAK compliant.
Not so fast there.  That isn't the stated problem.  The problem is
that not only can some 3rd party adopt it (no modifications necessary,
that's why I'm dubing it "GAK compliant"), but that the rest of the
compliant OpenPGP standards would automatically cooperate to some
degree, and we would thereby be streamlining the migration path to
mandatory GAK.  If PGP retract the GAK compliancy feature, by removing
the functionality in the key, we won't be calling it GAK compliant.
They (and any other government or corporate message snooping feature
implementors) can achieve message snooping without adding this
functionality to the OpenPGP standard.
No, they are not.  I've argued in reply to your other post why this is
clearly not so.  The difference is that PGP is creating a new animal:
a key which it is defined will be auto-encrypted to two keys by the
_sender_.  Variations being discussed being auto-encrypt with user
query, or auto-encrypt with user override to disable.  Regardless, the
fact that PGP is encouraging the process of enforcing this dubious
security practice via their policy enforcer means that users are
forced to use the GAK compliancy feature to get through to any
corporates who are using PGP's method of implementing corporate
message snooping.
It's less strongly enforced GAK compliance, but I think it is still
a form of GAK compliance.
To see why this might be, consider the effects of 80% of the business
community using this feature, and you as a pro-privacy cypherpunk type
(you are pro-privacy aren't you?).  Consider also that government has
mandated that companies hand over their message snooping master key to
the Feds.
Now what happens.  In the above, you have the "option" not to use the
GAK compliance feature in that you can still send a message, but the
option won't be worth much in that the recipient will be unable to
read it.  If lots of people are using this system, that will cut you
off.  You will be unable to send email to these people.  It's all very
well to say you have the "choice" not to do business with them, but
your choices may be severely restricted.
I hope that following from this discussion you can see the advantages
of PGP switching to the use of the normal multiple crypto recipient
field to acheive this message snooping functionality.  It doesn't
apply at all to the recipient.  The snooping of received email for
those using PGP 5.6 "message snooping for businesses" is done after
decryption in the PGP5.6 "for message snooping enforcing" client.  The
snooping of sent mail for users of PGP5.6 "for message snooping
enforcement" client is done inside the corporate LAN as the message
snooping packet security leak prevention functionality built in to the
PGP 5.6 "SMTP prevention of security leaks enforcer" strips out the
second message snooping crypto recipient packet.
You may have not been convinced of the case, but that is because you
have not considered the long term picture, interoperability issues,
and utility to GAKkers of having GAK compliant features in the IETF
OpenPGP standard.
The argument that pgp5.5 has mandatory GAK compliancy does not in any
way apply to older versions of PGP.
PGP 2.x can support voluntary GAK in that the user can send to a
second key that the NSA generates for thme.
It is the features which move the enforcement of this functionality
into the senders client, and the fact that the "optional" nature
becomes weakly optional (meaninglessly optional) if you consider
scenarios where most businesses are using the pgp5.5 SMTP policy
enforcer to bounce your email unless it complies, and where business
are legally required to use such policy enforcers, and businesses are
legally required to hand over the master corporate snooping key to the
GAKkers to go in the NSA database.
That's a separate argument entirely.  I believe that I have shown
security advantages in not doing corporate message snooping in the way
that PGP is "proposing" (by steaming ahead and implementing and
deploying it outside of the IETF OpenPGP process).  In addition I made
the point earlier that any form of message snooping is weak... there
are many ways for the determined employee to by pass it.  The only
real protection is surveillance cameras, tamper-resistant key board
logs, and body cavity searches at the door.  So if enforcement is weak
anyway, it seems sensible to trade some small percentage of this
enforceability for enhanced security.
I went to great pains to detail other more secure, and entirely
feasible methods of assuring corporate message snooping functionality
can be built.
I also clearly distinguised between stored documents and documents in
transit in transient communications mediums.
In addition I argued for key escrow of storage keys as good company
backup policy.
You have not been paying attention here, or are playing the function
of the luddite, refusing to accept that better security is obtained by
separating the functionality of encryption keys and storage keys.
A similar example might be if you were to refuse to countenance the
suggestion that having separate signature and encryption keys is
better than not doing using as an argument perhaps the fact that
pgp2.x has been using the same key for both purposes for years.
The point of the IETF OpenPGP standardisation process is to explore
the options and decide on the best technical approach, which is in the
interests of the Internet community.

OK, that means the correct technical term for my discussion is an
argument over the GAK compliancy subpacket type.
I really like this non-exportable signature option.  It is highly
useful.  I have a couple of keys on my key ring with signatures on
them that I have mentally flagged as non-exportable.  This is because
they are signatures by the True Name of nyms I happen to know the True
Name of and are intended to allow me to transfer the trust to that
Nym, but the Nym is trusting me not to make public this signature.
It would be really kind of neat to extend this functionality so that I
_couldn't_ export the key by making the certifcate a non-transferable
signature, or a designated verifier signature.
This is the controversial object.  I have been arguing in a couple of
earlier posts today that this design is a bad idea from a security
perspective, and from the point of view that it is a form of GAK
compliancy when coupled with PGP's SMTP policy enforcer.
The reason I say this is that if we get to the situation where many
businesses are using PGP 5.5 + PGP policy enforcer, the clients
"choice" to not encrypt to the message snooping second crypto
recipient in the CMRK subpacket will have little practical meaning.
The user will be forced to comply or be unable to send messages which
don't bounce.
A better place to do corporate snooping, and to avoid the extra
security risk of sending messages over the internet encrypted to two
rather than one long term encryption keys, is to snoop the plaintext
after it has been decrypted in the PGP 5.5 mail client.
Also, the message snooping functionality is reading between the lines;
Jon's post no where mentioned this as a user requirement.  What he
said was that corporates had a need to recover encrypted email
messages stored in encrypted mail folders.  If this is truly the case,
the functionality is even easier to achieve, just encrypt the mail
folder to a company escrowed storage key after decryption.  Easy to
do, and more secure.  Same flexibility in reflecting the internal
structure of the company's trust and risk management in the storage
key escrow architecture.
If PGP is going to forge ahead and try for this flawed message
snooping architecture anyway, I would urge you personally to at least
press upon them to remove the flag meaning that a message will not be
received without the use of the message snooping key, and to remove
the functionality preventing delivery in the SMTP policy enforcer.
OK.  The controversy has technical basis too -- and seems to be
starting to be discussed in this forum also.  There is also a question
of how this design interacts with the IETF policy of not allowing
political issues to weaken protocol designs to discuss.
I've read Matt's PolicyMaker paper.  I can see the attraction of
moving towards these generalisedl trust statement syntaxes.
I would be nice to see the topic of the recipient refusing email based
on policies relating to third party access to messages in transit
being addressed in the standard when and if PGP gets to that stage.
There are some nice uses for some types of recipient refusal.  Ecash
payment for message processing, or my less $ oriented hashcash
proposal also.  (The types of problem that can arise with real ecash
payment for receipt, which hashcash avoids is that if applied to
discussion forums, it can bias the forums to allowing through more of
what rich people have to say.  A similar argument perhaps applies to
email following up to comments made in public forums, you can only
reply to someone if you have the money.  Busy people may set very high
payment rates.)
I can see problems with this type of assertion.  I hope when the time
comes that a way to define a convetion or set of rules which disallows
this as part of the standard.
We'll see when we get to it.  In the mean time, PolicyMaker &
look-alikes are vapourware.
It's similar to PICs in that third party rating services are fine (for
example consumer product evaluations in various magazines), but
centrally controlled ones are objectionable to many of us.
The problem with this point, which you say is PRZ's, is that it falls
down for interoperability reasons when the system is widely deployed.
Exactly how much "choice" do you have when 80% of businesses will
bounce your mail if you don't comply.  How much "choice" do you have a
few years later when 95% of individuals and companies are using the
same system, and the government is holding the master snooping keys.
[1] The long term likely value of this choice is rather low, so the
assertion that it leaves you empowered is a weak assertion.  You would
paradoxically in this case be much more empowered if the recipient did
the escrowing silently after receipt by decrypting and storing his
mail folder with an escrowed storage key.  Of course it would be nice
if this policy was advised in the public key also, to at least warn
you, in case you mistook the persons email address as a private
account.  (Some ISPs have names which look similar to some companies
names,... domain names ending in .com, if you are not familiar with
the company name).
I submit for the above reasons that this overriding feature will in
the long term me fairly meaningless.  What is the practical individual
empowerment transferred in being able to override something in the
sure knowledge that it will thereby be bounced and not delivered.
I strongly disagree for reasons stated in paragraph [1] above.

@_author: Adam Back 
@_subject: PGP CAKware & IETF controlled Open-PGP standard 
Agree.  What I am proposing is to make GAK enabled systems
non-interoperable with the OpenPGP standard on the sending end (ie to
define that when you receive a message it won't dictate to you that
you should use GAK compliancy, and to define that if flags indicating
message snooping is ocurring this won't be enforced by your mail being
bounced if you don't, and won't be implemented with encrypting to a
special snooping crypto recipient).  What PGP is proposing with PGP
5.5 is to implement enforcement on end users to send to GAK (or
corporate snooping) enabled keys using the snooping key.
They claim that it's ok, because the user is empowered, as he can
override the sending to the snooping key.  But, if you enable the
sender of a message you receive to state (in syntax defined as part of
the OpenPGP standard, or even if it is not) that if you don't encrypt
to this corporate snooping key (or technically equivalent
functionality: government GAKking key) the message will bounce, how is
this user empowerment, or choice in any meaningful way.  How is this
user empowered to choose when 80% of businesses end up using this
feature?  Or when the government mandates this feature.
You beat me to it ... my reply crossed in the mail :-)
Even if you do argue that they do have the right to snoop incoming
messages (and there may be a case for this even if some of us find it
a bit little brotherish), this can still be just as easily catered
for, without building GAK compliance into the IETF OpenPGP standard by
having the user's client software decrypt and store their mail folder
in plain text, or encrypted to a company escrowed storage key.
Such a system would not be at all GAK compliant.
(I am glad that you managed to persuade William that this was
necessary, I didn't notice him agree :-) William should however be
credited for the useful contribution that you can just as easily
implement corporate snooping with the existing multiple crypto
recipients functions of pgp2.x.  (Without the GAK compliancy baggage).
I'll go for this idea.  X509 v3 certificates have such an extension,
and it seems like a very useful functionality for OpenPGP to include.
Re. the argument about separating key functionality leading to more
consistent and secure designs, if people don't like 3 keys, you should
see some of the Norwegian standards stuff which was relayed to me at a
eurpean medical messaging standarisation meeting... they reportedly
have 5 key usages defined:
  1. storage
  2. signatures
  3. encryption
  4. certificates
  5. authentication
It came about I suspect because the real unstated feature they are
trying to implement is message snooping, and not stored email folder
access as the "data recovery" badge used by Jon in his first post may
lead one to assume.  Of course the reason they think they are able to
use the argument that "email is both storage and communications" to
justify this is largely because they haven't yet digested the meme
that you should have separate storage keys.
I also heartily agree with William Allen Simpson's comments.

PGP Inc is the group being impatient.  They have been rushing ahead
implementing things behind closed doors which some of us are arguing
should be made non-conforming (WILL NOTs) in the standard.
If PGP doesn't backoff a bit _they'll_ have non-conforming
implementations, and will have to change them.  The danger is that in
a Netscape-like manner, they will use their implementation and
deployment as arguments to justfiy their design decisions rather than
being involved in open design decision justifications as part of the

This is not how the IETF standardisation process is supposed to work.
Trial implementation of proposals is fine, closed door design and

Not automatically, no, I doubt it would work.
Yes.  I agree.
Yes.  I was getting carried away.  It would be too complex, most
The thrust of your argument seems to be that there would be little use
making pgp 5.5 non-GAK compliant, because PolicyMaker style statements
will be so flexible that they will be GAK compliant anyway.
So, when are PGP starting work on PolicyMaker?  Is it intended to
introduce this functionality in this first round standardisation?  It
seems to me that adding PolicyMaker functionality could take some
considerable time due to the huge complexity of the task.
Also, just because GAK compliance will become possible if and when
PolicyMaker style extensions are implemented, doesn't mean that PGP
can expect popular support for actually going ahead and implementing
GAK compliancy in pgp5.5; nor can it expect to gain popular support
for the uncharacteristic big brotherish mentality displayed by those
working at PGP in implementing the SMTP policy enforcer behind closed
doors to enforce other people to modify their behaviour to honour
third parties GAK or CAK requests.
I think the whole thing is a huge PR fluff up.  I'm suprised that
those at PGP were all able to agree to do it without arguments being
expressed by employees, and without those arguments leaking out of the
company (given the picture Jon Callas painted of strong privacy and
freedom biases at PGP).  If there had been open discussion of the
product's design prior to development, this feed back could have been
obtained earlier.
I presume the PGP PR person (who ought to get the sack in my opinion)
thought that a sudden press release of such marvelous new feature as
PGP snoopware and a snoopware enforcer for third parties would go down
well.  It doesn't.  The enforcer is rudely enforcing the companise
opinions on people who have no connection with the companies snoopware
policies.  You should keep such matters within the company by using
escrowed storage keys to acheive snoopware.
For these reasons I still argue that we should:
- add storage keys to the standard
   It's more secure to do this.  That should be argument enough in
   itself.  It also is much cleaner separating key functionality out
   into separate keys where those keys have vastly different recovery,
   life time, and security requirements.
- use storage key escrow to implement PGP snoopware instead of burdening
  the OpenPGP standard with the stigma of GAK compliancy
   This method ties in with the use of storage keys.  It is nearly as
   effective a snoopware design.  It also isn't GAK compliant.  It
   also doesn't result in cypherpunks shouting at you.
- don't use the special sub-packet type to flag GAK compliancy
   I think the above shows that the neither the standard, nor PGP Inc
   needs the GAK compliant sub-packet, so scrap it, and save the
   argument up for the much more defensible position of a generalised
   PolicyMaker style  key usage restriction assertions
- scrap the controversial SMTP snoopware policy enforcement app
   Use storage key escrow to implement PGP snoopware instead of
   burdening the OpenPGP standard with the stigma of GAK compliancy
It's difficult to get standards which don't reflect big brotherish
aims when the good reputation of PGP Inc and Phil Zimmermann is
apparently behind it.  Something weird is going on at PGP
headquarters.  PRZ is also silent.  Are all the people at PGP Inc in
accord in thinking that the snoopware policy enforcer is a really cool
pro-privacy app?  Some of the usually more vocal PGPers have remained
silent throughout the entire episode.  Also as Tim note's the lack of
a Zimmermann Telegram (tm) getting suspiciously overdue.  Is he
dragging his feet of snoopware and GAK compliancy?

@_subject: new "communication key" semantics & PFS 
Now that we're considering (within the IETF OpenPGP standardisation
framework) the prospect of having a separate communications key, and
storage key, there are some aspects of communications keys which are
currently less than ideal because of their current misuse to also
function as storage keys.
This argues for a new functionality to be given to communication only
keys.  This is all tied up with the idea of Perfect Forward Secrecy
(PFS), which is basically the statement of the fact that
communications keys are more sensitive than storage keys, because your
attacker by definition has a copy of the encrypted communication.
(You're sending over an open network where copying all traffic is a
low cost exercise for a savvy system cracker, or spook, or industrial
espionage).  In contrast an attacker often will have to break into your premises to
obtain the data protected by your storage keys.  Another aditional
vulnerability of communication keys is that the US government is very
interested in obtaining copies of them via their "key escrow"/"key
recovery"/GAK initiative.  The strongest anti-GAK statement you can
make is to use forward secrecy.  I've raised this point before, but
the meme doesn't seem to have penetrated yet.
It ties in quite well with what is in my view proper handling of
communication keys.  If we can break the tie with one key being used
for both storage and communication, we can start to reflect in the
protocol better security practice in the handling of communication
Forward secrecy is one way of looking at it.  It doesn't have to be
real interactive forward secrecy as you might get in an SSH session,
or an SSL session, or some of the IPSEC standards, though these are
other examples which could server as examples showing that forward
secrecy is a good idea, for anyone who would like to argue against it.
The basic principle is that you want to have communication keys which
don't live for a long time.  So one form of weak forward secrecy you
could have would be to mark your El Gamal or RSA communications for
much more frequent update, by giving it a short expiry date.  Say once
per week.
Some people currently do this manually anyway.  For example see Dave
Wagner's web page ( where he describes what
he does with keys.  (He has a long term signature only key which he
uses to sign short lived "communication only" keys which he discards
after expiry).  What I am arguing for essentially is building this
kind of improved communication key handling into the OpenPGP spec for
keys marked as "communication only".
In addition I think it would be nice to enable a new kind of
communications key which is based on discrete log so that people who
choose to use PGP protocols for more interactive email transfer
protocols than SMTP can generate keys very quickly.  I was originally
thinking that this would have to be DH, but perhaps you can simulate
DH PFS with El Gamal by securely wiping the private parameters of
expired communications keys, and keeping the public modulus and g
value.  (This has similarities with the quick method in PGP5.x of
generating El Gamal keys with precomputed shipped primes that you
already have).  The advantage being that you may be trying to generate
keys frequently, so you may not want to wait for a full new 4096 bit
El Gamal or 2048 bit RSA key generation, when you are not anticipating
the sudden delay in sending messages.
I was originally thinking it would be done by having a new DH key type
(in addition to RSA, El Gamal, DSA).  (Incidentally Hal, you may recognise in this the reason for some of my
annoyance that PGP Inc is mislabelling El Gamal as "DH" -- with my
earlier ideas on this proposal there would have been a _real_ DH.  It
also gets around objections to do with not being able to decide what
DH keys are (as they are negotiated not randomly generated directly)
which Hal raised as a reason why PFS (at least with DH) would disallow
functionality where key capabilities are included in the public
communications key encrypted packet, the last time this was discussed.
Clearly you could work around this restriction if you had to -- just
include the information in an extra packet encrypted with the
contained key and some symmetric algoirthm for example, though this
may limit algorithm choice at least for that packet).
You can use PFS in an asynchronous "where possible" mode for
non-interactive email transport situations.  That is you would perhaps
send new communications keys parameters with each message that defines
in it's key sub-packet preferrences that it is capable of using
communications only keys, and will be able to handle "recipients comms
key as part of message".  This might make sense where comms keys are
being updated too quickly to burden a key server with, or where comms
keys are not public (an aditional use for Hal's described no-export
flag for signatures, but here applied to communications keys), but are
specific to that communicating pair. (For paranoid people who are
changing comms keys on each receipt, you would need to do this).
As soon as one party has replied to a mail from the other, you can
switch to forward secrecy.  This would lead to emails such as "hi, can
you reply to this message please".  These are kind of similar to the
"hi can you send me your public key" you get back from people when you
haven't included your public key in your mail to them, and they don't
have access to a keyserver.
You can also then use this new "communications only" key setup to cope
with fully interactive email delivery for systems using email
transports other than standard SMTP.
You should probably overlap sending communications keys if you aren't
relying on keyservers due to frequency of key update, or for
convenience for people without access to keyservers, so that the
person sending you email is less likely to have no current
communications key for you if you are using keys sent in the message.
So towards the end of the month (if you had a policy of using
communications only keys with monthly updates) replacing keys monthly
start sending the next months communications key also, marked as not
for use until it's starting date.
(The use of very transient communications keys I think would imply a
need for two communications keys: you'll need a long term
communications key which is used for initial non-PFS mail in order to
set up PFS.)
With the separation of storage and communications keys all the
architecture has much better security decisions:
- We are able to treat communications with variable amounts of
  sensitivity, by giving different key expiry time periods to comms only
  keys.
- We are also able to secure and escrow our long term data storage in
  mail box folders, or PGP encrypted files without having to live with
  a GAKware compliant implementation of snoopware.  We can storage
  escrow keys appropriately without all the name calling and bad PR
  caused by enraged crypto anarchists, and crypto consultants.
You _know_ it makes sense :-)

@_subject: the case for separate comms keys 
Ryan Anderson  writes on cpunks:
The security principle I am referring to is that by doing as PGP
currently does, and using encryption keys in place of separate
communications and storage keys you are exposing your past traffic to
undue risk.
I am not at all referring to symmetric keys, because the fact that
they are randomly generated and used once doesn't protect them from
recovery via the compromise of your long encryption key and your
attackers copy of your encrypted communications.  The reason for
randomly generating IDEA session keys is a separate one.
The argument for having separate storage and communication keys is a
similar one to the now accepted argument that it is a good idea to
have separate signature and encryption keys.  The obvious advantage of
separating signature keys from encryption keys (introduced in pgp5) is
that if you escrow keys you don't want to escrow signature keys as all
this enables is forgery.
No.  I wasn't discussing signature keys.
Yes.  That's half of the story.  The other half of the story is that
PGP went ahead and implemented a SMTP snoopware policy enforcer which
could just as easily be used to enforce GAK.
I'm not sure that the fact that the pgp5.0 client doesn't attempt to
force you to use the GAK compliancy key adds much to my comfort level
that the whole thing won't end up being used for mandatory GAK.  My
scepticism is derived from the fact that the enforcement of the GAK
compliancy key is provided by another marvelous PGP Inc big brother
innovation: the SMTP snoopware/GAK compliancy policy enforcement app.
The argument doesn't really become apparent until you consider the
effects of lots of people (say 80% of companies) using PGP's GAK
compliancy enforcement.  A few more thin edge of the wedge moves on
the part of the USG GAK proponents (eg deputising service providers as
GAK compliancy enforcers, something which has already been discussed
in the past with the Clipper series), and you will suddenly be unable
to exchange mail with anyone without using GAK.  Sure you have a
"choice", you can send email to people that will bounce 100% of the
time, whoever you send to due to lack of GAK compliance field.
(Except for perhaps a few die hard cypherpunks).
I'm not sure what you mean here.
It might appear complex, but actually adding the distinction between
communications and storage keys greatly simplifies things, and it
allows you to make more appropriate security decisions about key life
times, and escrow.  It also allows you to implement the message
snooping function in a more secure way, and with less big brotherish
Using separate storage keys allows you to:
- escrow storage keys within your company without including GAKware
  compliancy
- discard communications keys often (by giving them short life-spans)
  which greatly enhances your security
Storage keys could be symmetric keys if they are for your own use
only, or you could escrow them if you want to share access, or your
company wants the extra assurance of data availability that storage
key escrow brings.  There might be some security advantages to using
symmetric keys even.  (Public key sizes are a faster sliding and more
uncertain target than symmetric key sizes.
You can sign and encrypt with symmetric keys also. "pgp -cs."  Quite a
useful combination.
I used to do the opposite of what you do... I used to use pgp -cs,
because I explicitly didn't want the public key baggage, and danger
that 1024 bit keys might be readable in 10-20 years, the then maximum
key size.
It's probably simpler to just escrow storage keys.  That is just give
management a copy to put in the fire proof safe.  Or secret split or
You could use multiple crypto recipient if you wanted to -- it's
basically just another way of acheiving the same thing.
There is one (quite practical) reason, however, to use symmetric
storage keys.  Speed.  If you're encrypting lots of files (perhaps
using an encrypted parition driver such as Peter Gutmann's SFS), you
won't have time to encrypt to public keys, never mind multiple public
If the company keeps it's employee's storage keys in escrow, the fact
that you're using a symmetric key works fine.
I don't see that it's any more difficult to do as I outline above,
which is better security practice in any case.
Don't confuse key functionality with user ergonomics.  PGP or other
vendors could easily implement a unified interface to a secured
private key database containing all of your persistent private keys.
You need only have one key.  Or perhaps no keys -- in a secured
environment, or with keys stored on smart cards.
I'm not really fussy beyond the fact that it will be less efficient in
space (extra public key packets would be significant for a disk block
level partition encrypter), and the performance issues with using
public key crypto to encrypt lots of files to multiple people. Nope speed of recovery is not the issue.
I'm sure I've given these reasons earlier in the thread, but I'll
summarise them again:
1. It is more secure to use short lived communications keys because
communications keys are more sensitive than storage keys.  This is
because with communications your attacker has copies of your
ciphertext as you're sending it over an insecure open communications
medium.  Your storage data is on your hard disk, possibly in a secured
2. People shouldn't be able to recover the data from communications
because for security reasons it should be encrypted with transient
communication keys.  You are purposelly securely wiping the key after
some period.  Keeping extra doors into the communication weakensn this
3. given that secured communications are now defined as transient in
nature, for security reaons: the natural way to archive such
communicated data is to re-encrypt it for a storage key.
4. people don't really want access after the fact to their transient
communications, they want access to their archived email.
5. you can still implement corporate snooping, and I acknowledge that
businesses have a right to do this (though personally I may not choose
to work for a company which does this).  But you can implement message
snooping, by implementing key escrow of the storage key used to secure
your email archives.  To enforce this to the extent that you can, you
build in automatic archiving in a way which is hard to defeat in the
mail client to decrypt communication with the comms key, and then
re-encrypt with the escrowed storage key.
6. Given the marked difference in life time, security requirements,
and data availability requirements between stored data and transient
communications keys is it any wonder that you can achieve a more
flexible, more secure system by separating functionality of your keys

@_subject: negative security aspects of GAK compliance 
I think there is a clear technical security case against the GAK
compliant packet, which I would like to see comments on from people
who think the political GAK compliant argument is not significant.
This ties in with using separate storage and communications keys, and
with the better security practice of having shorter lived
communications keys to provide forward secrecy from the point of
issuing new communication keys (could be once per month, once per
week, or once per message).
Once you acknowledge that it is more secure to have short lived
communication keys (which in my view it very clearly is), it should be
clear that by putting a GAK compliancy packet feature, or other second
recipient you are weakening the security because that is another door
into a message which you are trying to make forward secret -- you are
trying to ensure that after the fact, no-one, not even the recipient
can decrypt the old traffic.  (This is a very good way of ensuring
that third parties, like industrial espionage spies, people using
black mail or the Feds using rubber hoses, or supeonas or other legal
or extra legal forms of coercion, can't obtain from you keys to
decrypt it either, so they don't get plain text).  The fact that the extra door into the message is outside the
recipients control means that his own security could be compromised by
sloppy practice on the part of that key holder.
This argues that if people are to insist on using the enforced second
recipient model for corporate snooping at all, they should for
security reasons be at least using short lived communications keys for
the GAK compliancy packet also.
Or, as I would argue, most secure of all is not using GAK compliancy
packets at all, but rather to use escrowed storage keys to retain
access to mail archives.  This is more secure because you don't keep
second doors into what should be a communication encrypted with as few
as possible (namely: one) transient communications key, with security
policy control being in the hands of the person who owns the key (the
As I have pointed corporate access to stored email can be acheived
with similar amounts of snooping enforceability by having the PGP5.5
mail client store to an escrowed communications key after decryption,
or even to re-encrypt after decryption to a long term storage company
archive access bot within the LAN (with such encrypted messages
themselves being wrapped in an extra comms encryption envelope using
short term communications key if you like).
I would be interested to see anyone refute this security argument from
a security point of view.

[Padgett, you're Cc'd because I'm quoting something you once claimed
on Perry's list, I think]
I agree with basically every word Peter Trei wrote.  It's not often
you agree with a long post like that 100%, but I could not fault a
single point.
Contrast that to PGP's Jon Callas's recent posts where I found myself
disagreeing with a large proportion of both technical and political
Just a couple of nit-picky comments on various things, and some
re-iteration of the technical arguments against GAK compliancy (to
supplement Peter's good political arguments):
Clipper was definately advertised as a 80bit key, I agree.
But I did once see someone else claim that it was a 64 bit key, and
this was by Padgett Peterson, who is usually pretty good with facts,
though perhaps his claim was speculation in this case.  (I've added
him to the Cc).
His reasoning was that the 16 bit checksum (which Matt Blaze
demonstrated could be brute forced thereby trashing the GAK
enforcement) would come out of the 80bit key size, thereby meaning
that it was only an effective 64 bit key.  I suppose this claim if it
is correct would be similar to DES keys being 64 bit, but 8bits being
parity (checksum again), and therefor being only 56 bit effective.
The DES case would set a precedent for NSA design involvement using
larger "keys" than effective keys.  If this is true, the clipper /
skipjack system was even more flawed than we believed, as not only was
it possible to brute force the checksum, but the key space could have
been brute forced also, possibly without knowing the algorithm either,
just by buying lots of clipper chips (though I think this would
require knowledge of the checksum algorithm).  But clearly the NSA
could have brute forced the traffic in addition to having back doors.
Of course, I think it likely that the key was actually a 96 bit key
with an effictive key size of 80bits after the 16 bit checksum.
Regardless, if Padgett's speculation is correct, I suspect this is not
what Jon was thinking.
I must defend Jon a little bit here in that it was fairly widely
agreed that the wording in some of the Clipper documents (perhaps
FOIAed, perhaps released normally, don't know) that the NSA would have
an extra access for "national security" (there's that magic root
password to the constitution again).  The presumtion a lot of people
held was that the NSA would have a second unified copy of the split
databasee to enable this national security access.  I'm not sure of
course that this is actually ever explicitly admitted anywhere, and it
could be that they would just have direct access to both split
databases, but I wouldn't really have thought this was the likely; I
suspect the NSA would've wanted access without others even with in
special wire-tapping courts knowing their tapping activities.
Whether or not this is what Jon was referring to I don't know.
I agree with the negative political aspects Peter expressed of PGP's
"GAK compliancy" (as I like to call it) in PGP's pgp5.5 & SMTP policy
I also think there is a purely technical security case to be made
against this architecture which I have tried to lay out clearly in my
post titled:
Peter made some security points about this also.  I think we should be
able to win the argument about GAK compliancy purely on technical
The only vaguely logical objection I've seen to arguing against GAK
compliancy on political grounds was Hal Finney's assertion that
OpenPGP should move towards more generalised forms of key assertions
in the form of PolicyMaker-like key assertions (Matt Blaze has a paper
and system called PolicyMaker).
However PolicyMaker I suspect will be a long time coming, and may not
be supported by all vendors due to complexity, and in addition even
with PolicyMaker, the same political and security arguments against
actual use of PGP Inc's GAK compliancy field (or PolicyMaker
assertions to the same effect) still forcefully apply.  And there are
still in particular security and political arguments against
implementing corporate access to mail archives, or corporate
sent/received mail snooping by using the SMTP GAK compliancy policy
Lastly I would comment that it is sad that we on cypherpunks are
having to expend so much energy trying to persuade PGP Inc with it's
supposed pro-privacy stance, and supposedly pro-privacy employees,
that they should be working against GAK, and even to get them to
acknowledge that what they are doing is pro-GAK, and big brotherish is
an uphill struggle.
PGP Inc with their poor PR management, and hugely insensitive pro-GAK
moves mean that PGP Inc is pissing away Phil Zimmermann's good
reputation at a huge rate of knots.
Wake up PGP.  Look what you are becoming.

@_author: Adam Back 
@_subject: the case for separate comms keys 
I'm fairly sure this is not the case.  The reason I think that this is
not the case is because Jon described two flags which go in the GAK
compliancy sub-packet:
Flag1:  this flag is an advisory note to the person who obtains a
Flag2:	this flag is the same as the flag1 above plus it is a big
I understood the reason that the recipient will not receive the
message when you don't honour keys with flag2 to be that the SMTP
policy enforcer would either bounce the message, or eat it, or send it
to the company snoopware czar to who can take due note in his employee
dossier collection that this employee is receiving email from
suspicious cypherpunk persons who don't believe in snoopware.
The above functionality is the reason I'm arguing that PGP's method of
implementing corporate snoopware is GAK compliant: clearly the whole
system is ready tailored for GAK.  The only thing left to do is plug
in the governemnts key in the GAK compliancy field, and for the
government to mandate that companies, and deputised ISPs use the
software and the GAK master key.
If/when this GAK compliancy gets used as the architecture for real
live mandatory GAK, the SMTP policy enforcer may be set up to narc out
the suspicious person who doesn't believe in GAK to the Feds/NSA, and
they will then come and lock you up if they can trace your SMTP From
field to you.
This will make a mockery out remailers, because the remailer chain
will also be forced to have the GAK master key in it as enforced by
deputised ISPs running PGP's SMTP policy enforcers with GAK keys
installed as the GAK master key. Oh, I see what you mean.  The reason I didn't understand is that this
is not how I thought it works.  I think the key is provided right
there in the GAK compliancy field in an inseparable way.  (I could be
wrong on this, but this is the way I read Jon's message).
Even if have misunderstood the way that this key is bundled, it
doesn't really alter the fact that by "choosing" not to encrypt to
messages with the flag2 flag you will know that this is a waste of
time, because your message will not get past the SMTP policy enforcer.
So purposely stripping the key from your key ring, or separating the
key pair when someone sends you them together would just be another
way of exercising the choice PGP is claiming you have in "choosing" to
have your message bounced back at you.  A fairly meaningless "choice".
I would be interested to have this point about the way GAK compliancy
key is bound/bundled with the GAK compliancy sub-packet clarified by a
PGPer, or someone with more understanding of the draft docs, if this
much information is available yet.
I don't think this is so because that would invalidate the semantics
of the flag1 and flag2 flags, which are what instructs PGP to warn you
of this requirement for this key.  The flag is an attribute of the key
itself, though I do suppose you might be able to strip off the
attribute in much the same way as you can remove signatures from keys
with pgp -krs.
I don't think it complicates web of trust.  The only certification you
need of communications keys is for you to sign them with your
signature key.  Your signature key semantics, and the web of trust is
It will be automatic .. you won't notice because all the OpenPGP
compliant application which supports this proposed (strongly
encouraged MAY, please!) feature will do when it creates a new
communications key is to sign the communications key with your
signature key.  It won't involve third parties re-issuing
It is the same way that certification and WoT interacts with
potentially shorter life-span dual use encryption keys at the moment.
The WoT certificates go on your longer life signature key, and it is
you who signs your encryption key.  Same argument, though now applied
to encryption keys marked as "communications only".
512 bit I think is reckoned to be feasible for an academic crack of
similar scale to the recent RSA challenge DES break.  The memory for
the final matrix crunching phase might be the only arguable point.
However, this doesn't really give me 20 years worth of assurance
because, well Rivest and friends encrypted the message "squeamish
ossifrage" back in 1977 or thereabouts, firm in the belief that it
would not be broken for 1000s of years.  Factoring advances have meant
that that ~380 bit keys (squeamish ossifrage was RSA129 digits
decimal) is now relatively easy.  Paul Leyland and friends broke a 384
bit blacknet key as a private attack without massive internet
I'm not sure anyones promising, or has any mathematical proof that new
factoring algorithms won't provide similar factoring speedups.  How
many years are 1024 bit RSA keys good for?  All you can use as
estimators is the current factoring algorithms.  I'm not sure how
certain these estimates are for long term purposes.
In contrast if there is nothin wrong with 3DES nor IDEA, the key space
protects you, modulo Moore's law which is easier to predict.  (Also
modulo quantum computing break-throughs, in both cases, erk!)
Yes.  But memory on workstations is increasing in leaps and bounds.
It is very common now for personal PCs and even laptops to have 32Meg.
A few years ago we were living below the 640k barrier.  Leave it a few
years, and people will have the required memory levels.  A few more
years on from that people will be grizzling about living below the 4Gb
barrier (restriction from using 32 bit addresses).
Anyway, one of the factoring gurus may come up with another novel
implementation or algorithm tweak to tune down memory requirements.
Or a newly discovered faster factoring alorgithm may have huge memory
advantages over current alogirthms.
The future is uncertain.  But it is marginally less uncertain for
well tried and tested symmetric keys ciphers.
Don't think it says it anywhere, but you can combine flags in lots of
logical ways which aren't documented as such, and most of which work
as you might reasonaly extrapoloate them to.  There are single letter
flags for most letters of the alphabet, the full number of
combinations must be quite large.  Quite a few of them mean
*something*.  Some of them are even phonetically pleasing: -feast etc :-)
Signature only might've been enough for backups of stuff in plaintext
on the disk like autoexecs.
Sure.  But you were also talking about autoexecs and other small files
where it could get significant.  The significant lose howver is the
performance -- say you recursively encrypt all the files in a
directory, each to 2 or 3 multiple crypto recipients.  It'll crawl.
I see.  Sounds reasonable.  You should be able to achieve that with
the current dual use PGP keys, or with the new "storage only" keys via
crypto recipients.
If your document is on the Internet, on the web perhaps, you'd need to
be aware of the reduced security in using long term storage keys as
opposed to short term communications keys, but other than that I can't
see a problem.
The point is that where you have a directional communication, you
should treat those keys as sensitive.  Where it is not a directional
communication, you can't, so you lose that extra security; for
applications where this is acceptable, I wouldn't argue for
restricting your ability to do it.
I think I understand what you're saying for shared storage keys.  But
I don't think it's an identical argument at all for communications
If you define communications keys as short lived highly sensitive
keys, as perhaps in SSL, or SSH (both of which use some forms of
forward secrecy), you can't retain the ability to recover the message
after the fact for security reasons.
However I posit that people don't really want access to the plaintext
stored inside encrypted communications for their own purposes for the
simple reason that they don't have a sendmail log including all the
message bodies.
Together with the security advantages of not being able to decrypt
communications traffic yourself after the fact, this argues that
people who do want full email archives for company legal or snooping
purposes, or just folder for their own use (I know I keep lots of
email in folders) can either store in the clear, or store encrypted
with a storage key, or store with an escrowed storage key, or store
encrypted to multiple storage keys as crypto-recipients as you
I don't think it's that theoretical.  Don't PGP have such an encrypted
disk driver for the MAC?  I think this is the way forward for simpler
storage encryption: encrypt the lot.  Saves arguments about forgetting
to encrypt stuff, or forgetting you did decrypt and leaving plaintext
copies around in /tmp or whever as well.
Your suggestion is one reasonable way of acheiving this.  You can also
acheive the same flexibility with an extra indirection with symmetric
storage keys (optionally held in escrow).  In fact I think this is
what later versions of Peter Gutmann's SFS do.  The reason he uses for
this is that it allows you to change your passphrase without
re-encrypting the whole disk, because the _actual_ disk encryption key
is encrypted itself with the hash of your passphrase, rather than
using the hash of the passphrase directly as the key.
Well I agree, I think it's reasonable for us to consider the major
uses, plaintext recovery demands, and security aspects of the
different types of uses for keys: transient communication keys,
storage keys, and signature keys.
It doesn't really matter one way or the other.  You can build
non-hierarchical recovery systems with either method.  (You can escrow
storage keys in your department, just as easily as add second crypto
recipient within your department.  I think the security is basically
the same for escrow or multiple recipient when we're talking about
The same security equivalence argument applies if you accept the
premise that you need access to transient communications.  I don't
accept this premise.  This premise is a fallacy promulgated by the
likes of Freeh.  If you don't escrow communications keys at all you
gain extra security for the same reason that it is less secure
actually to escrow storage keys, or use multiple recipient as another
way to achieve storage key escrow than to not use storage key escrow.
However with storage you live with this because a) data availibility
is important, and b) the risk isn't as great with storage because your
attacker has to breach physical security to obtain the data from your
disks and tapes.
The suggestions about snooping heirarchy -- who can read who's mail
within the company -- are independent of which architecture you choose
to use to allow access to the mail (escrow storage keys or use
multiple crypto recipient for storage keys).  (This can all be
enforced with similar levels of resistance to bypass by building the
archive and snooping features into the mail client to do this after
Where you start to get argument from me is when you start unduly
exposing what should be transient communications keys to construct
this corporate snooping pecking order.
That's what it's all about -- meaningful discourse so that we can
collectively improve each others understanding of the problems at
hand, pointing out flaws in each others arguments until we reach
agreement, eliminating misunderstanding.  With that a clarified
picture of the security issues and best architecture, we can then go
on to design suitable security protocols which best reflect this.
Hey, as long as we steer clear of PGP arguments about mandatory GAK
compliancy, this is all friendly discourse :-) On religious arguments: I must admit to strong negative feelings about
PGP Inc or the OpenPGP standard using weaker security methods to
enable GAK compliancy.  My reason for expressing these opinions is the
hope that we can talk PGP out of this big brotherish SMTP policy
enforcer, and associated GAK compliant fields, and to give my input to
try to steer the OpenPGP process away from incorporating said GAK
compliancy field into the standard.
Also as I hope I have explained relatively clearly in my other post
that GAK compliancy is independently from political arguments a
security design flaw.  And so I think that we should be able to reject
it on technical grounds alone as a design with weaker security.

Your claim has some plausibility, I'll grant.  You were already
singled out for special treatment, in that John Gilmore did
unsubscribe you, and block you from re-subscribing.  We know that much
because he admitted it himself.
Also Attila said something recently about some of his messages being
excluded from the unedited list, and being able to repost them at
night and have them go through.  He said he thought Tim May
experienced similar problems.
This is a serious charge because we were lead to believe that unedited
was completely unedited -- it was supposed to be straight through, and
neither John or Sandy ever admitted to editing unedited, yet according
to these claims it appears that it was being edited.
There are sort of plausible reasons why mail can disappear -- freak
delivery problem (happens now and then), or perhaps flakiness of
toad's majordomo to many changes being made to it.  It is sort of
within the bounds of believeability that these posts could have
disappeared by accident.
Given that multiple people are saying things about unedited being
edited (either by bots or by hand selection) it seems likley that
there was something sneaking going on towards the end, even with the
unedited list.
Wow.  That is a somewhat plausible claim also, one it might be
possible to verify from article headers in list archives.
I can confirm my belief that this part is true.  Numerous people have
verified this, which ocurred after Sandy faced his engineered

people who have said that they had satisfied themself of your

not done this myself, but I take your word for it.  However another aspect to this argument over credentials is a comment
that arose when another person with a PhD who used the title "Dr" in
his From line subscribed to the list.  That person was Fred Cohen.
His above average education in having his PhD didn't seem to reflect

be that listing qualifications in From fields is asking for rude

If Attila and Dimitri's suspicions are correct, in addition to the

out of hand, or auto-forwarding them to cypherpunks-flames.  Other

these aspects of the censorship experiment.
There appears to be a bit of a hush up surrounding the circumstances
of the pause in the moderation experiment and subsequent change of
moderation policy.
To clear the air, I think it would be kind of nice if the full story
were told, so I'll gather here a history as I understand it.
Information from my archives (those I have), and from asking around in
I realise that some of the actions that I am claiming of participants
in this sequence of events seem hard to believe given their high
reputation capital.  I was myself initially dubious on the strength of
the reputation capital of those being critisized.
However the below is the sequence of events as close as I can
I welcome being proven wrong on any points.
1. Dimitri Vulis posted a lot of off topic posts over a period of time
2. Dimitri reposted a couple of 50k Serdar Argic revisionist articles 3. Dimitri challenged John Gilmore to shut him up
4. John unsubscribed Dimitri, and modified majordomo at toad.com to
siltently ignore Dimitri's attempts to resubscribe.  Dimitri could
still post, and presumably read cypherpunks with a different email
address or via an archive.  It was a token unsubscription only.
5. When Dimitri figured out what John had done, he made many posts
denigrating John as a censor
6. Much discussion ensued critisizing John for blocking Dimitri
7. Over Christmas some joker subscribed cypherpunks at toad.com to a load
of sports mailing lists, Hugh Daniels and John cleaned up the mess
8. Followed a long thread on hardening lists against spam attacks
9. John made a post to the list announcing that the list would be
moderated for one month from Jan 11 as an experiment, and included
Sandy Sandfort's proposed moderatation policy and offer to act as
moderator.  It appeared that the moderation experiment was Sandy's
suggestion, and that John had agreed to go along with it.
10. Some discussion both pro and con of moderation, and the technical
, free speech, and legal aspects followed
11. Moderation started Jan 19, the main list became the moderated list
12. Lots of people complained about the moderation, some defended it
Tim May quietly unsubscribed
13. Some people complained about inconsistency in moderation -- some
articles which went to flames were not flamish, but made by posters
with low reputation capital, or were following up to posts which were
14. After a while some people commented on Tim's absence, and sent him
mail asking what happened.  Tim posted an article explaining that he
had left because of the imposed moderation without discussion.
15. John followed up with a post defending the moderation experiment,
and arguing for it's popularity (he claimed as evidence the number of
posters who had not taken the trouble to move to the unedited list).
16. Dimitri posted an article where he claimed that there was a
security flaw in Stronghold.  Stronghold is C2Nets commercial version
of the freeware Apache SSL web server.  Sandy is employed by C2Net.
17. Sandy dropped the posting entirely -- it went to neither
cypherpunks (edited), nor cypherpunks-flames.  He considered that
forwarding the posting would have made him legally liable.  Sandy is a
lawyer by profession.  He did not explain this situation on the list.
18. Tim May had by now subscribed to cypherpunks-flames, and posted
several follow-ups to Dimitri's posting, discussing the issue of
Dimitri's post being dropped, and stated that Dimitri's posting was
not flamish, and should not have been dropped in his opinion.  Tim's
postings were also silently dropped, going to neither of cypherpunks
(edited), and cypherpunks-flames.
19. Sandy made an announcement that he was ending his participation in
the moderation experiment.  Still no explanation of why posts were
dropped, or even admission that they were.
20. The two moderated cypherpunks lists (cypherpunks and
cypherpunks-flames) went dead for some time.
21. Tim received a warning from C2Net's lawyers that if he did not
desist from mentioning that Dimitri had posted an article criticising
a C2Net product that he would be sued!
22. John posted a statement where he explained Sandy's sudden
announcement of ending his particpation.  John explained that Sandy
had "hit a pothole in the moderation experiment when Mr. Nemesis
submitted a posting containing nothing but libelous statements about
Sandy's employer".  Sandy did not drop Johns posting even though it
covered the same topics that had resulted in Tim's posts being
dropped, and resulted in Tim receiving legal threats from C2Net.  In
the same post John said that he had come to the conclusion that he was
no longer willing to host the cypherpunks list.  In this post John
announced that Sandy had been persuaded to continue to moderate for
the remainder of the moderation period, and gave the new policy.  The
changes were that anything other than crypto discussion and discussion
of forming a new cypherpunks list would go to flames, and anything
that Sandy thought was libelous would be dropped silently.
23. Sandy posted a statement affirming that he would continue to
moderate, and that if any cypherpunks wished to discuss his prior
moderation policy and performance as a moderator that they do it on
new lists which they create themselves.
(If Sandy's current moderation criteria mean that he feels obliged to
forward this post to cypherpunks-flames as off-topic, or even to
silently drop it from both moderated lists, so be it.  I will simply
repost it later, when the moderation experiment is over on one of the
new lists.  In the event of myself receiving legal threats, I shall
simply post it via a remailer, or rely on someone else to do so.  C2
does not appear to be running any remailers at the moment, otherwise I
would use a remailer hosted at c2.net as the exit node in the remailer
The positive outcome of all this has been to make the cypherpunks list
more resilient to legal attack.  The new distributed list seems to be
progressing well, and will be less liable to attack.  Filtering
services continue, as they should.  And alt.cypherpunks has been
created as a forum ultimately resistant to legal attack.
Also I should say that I would hope that no one holds any long term
animosity towards any of the players in this episode, many of the
people have been very prolific in their work to further online privacy
and freedom, and I hope that we can all put this chapter behind us.

Anyone checked out the DES breaking project?
Over on          are details of mailing lists where people are organising breaking
RSADSIs DES challenge.  For the RC5/32/12/6 (48 bit RC5) break which
took 13 days, it seems there were a peak of 5000 machines involved.
At this rate it will take 8 months to break DES.

@_subject: D-H Forward Secrecy for E-Mail? 
It is difficult to have true interactive PFS for the reasons you
I did spend some time trying to work out a DH variant which could do
forward secrecy entirely non-interactively, but I couldn't find
functions with the desired properties.  If anyone is interested I can
repost the discussions of this, and my current note pad style
scribblings attempting to find said functions.  I am not convinced it
is impossible; perhaps some one will figure it out at some stage.  (I
have been having an intermittent on going discussion with Hal Finney
on this topic on and off list for the last year or so).
In the mean time what is entirely reasonable to do with email, with
pgp5.5 is to use short lived communications keys.  That is
communications keys which are planned to live for 1 week, say.
This would not result in immediate PFS as with interactive DH, but it
will be PFS at the end of the week.
You could do it more frequently if you wished.
As pgp 5.0 uses key servers directly from the mail client (and some
other clients do also), this all works out because you just publish
your new weekly communications key on the keyserver, and this
eliminates the need for interactive communications with your recipient
which true DH PFS requires.  In fact I think you could do this right
now, if you made it clear to others that your key has short expiry in
your .signature or whatever.  As I mentioned in another post David
Wagner currently does just this.
In my last post in the thread with subject:
I think I have proved that you can't sensibly use pgp 5.5 with short
lived communications keys without also adding storage keys.  People
are acknowledging the logic that:
1. short term communications keys are more secure
2. it is a security mismatch to use long term CAK keys with short term
   communications keys
3. if you use short term CAK keys, you can't recover stored email for long
4. if you use short term communications keys the recipient you can't
   even read old email folders
5. therefore you need storage keys also
6. as a side effect PGP Inc's GAK compliant implementation of
   corporate access to stored email is fundamentally flawed, and has to
   be replaced with a different non GAK compliant method.
(I'm working on that last point, it does follow, and I think the logic
is sound).
That is another way to do DH, and also is entirely reasonable.  You
could have this automatically for example if you were using one of the
IPSEC proposals which has forward secrecy at the IP transport layer.
If the systems which your mail went through to be delivered all used
IP level forward secrecy, the SMTP traffic would all be forward
However this form of forward secrecy has a different security focus;
keys are owned by machines rather than people, which means that it is
probably less secure.  For example you are relying on the security of
the recipients SMTP server.  Also the last hop of the link, between the recipients POP3 mailbox,
and the users dial up machine is unsecured typically at the moment.
Some IPSEC security on this link (or SSH tunneling) also would be
possible then allowing that last hop to be secured.  However it is a
bit like GSM mobile phone encryption, the links are secured, but the
traffic goes in the clear through the base station.  The traffic ends
up in clear in the recipients ISPs POP3 mailbox.
Of course, you would actually encrypt the payload email also; the
setup is more secure than no forward secrecy, because with out
tampering with machines.
IPSEC with forward secrecy is a _really_ big win for our side, because
it automatically defeats government GAK plans; what use is GAK for
fishing expeditions if you can't get the ciphertext because all the
links are protected with forward secrecy.  It preempts GAKkers in an
area where they have little control: IETF standardisation processes.
The standards process I think refused to accept "for export" key
sizes, on the grounds that the standards should not be weakened by
political considerations.  With an internationally agreed, widely
deployed IPSEC standard with forward secrecy, the GAKkers will be
screwed because to change it will eventually mean cutting yourself off
from the internet, and there will be much software to unpublish, and
much inertia to overcome.
I presume it is for these types of reasons that John Gilmore and
others are enthused with the tracking the IPSEC standardisation
process, and in John's case in organsing his free S/WAN project to
produce a free linux IPSEC implementation.

You will if you mark the key with this information.
This is the same approach PGP is already using to provide the GAK
compliant implementation of corporate access to stored emails.
I'm not arguing.  Of course they do.
What I _am_ arguing is that in designing systems to provide companies
with data recovery mechanisms that you should a) not weaken security
more than necessary, and b) that it would be nice if you used a method
which doesn't introduce GAK compliancy for communications keys.
I presented I think in plenty of detail an alternate mechanism which
is both non-GAK compliant, and more secure.  So what is the problem?
Is there a technical flaw in my solution?
Agreed 100%.  This is why I went to great pains to demonstrate
precisely how you could achieve recovery of stored messages in a more
secure and non-GAK compliant way.
my proposed mechanism for stored email recovery copes with all that.
Agreed.  You can flag backdoors with either solution.
It works well enough, but it could be made much more secure, by
separating storage key functionality from transient message key
functionality.  This would also give you the chance to resolve the
articificially created need for GAK compliancy, which arises because
you are being forced by this lack of distinction between key
functionalities to use one key for both long term storage and what
should be transient communications key usage.
If that is PGP's aim, they failed most miserably.
Decentralised control is good, of course, but the pgp5.5 and SMTP
policy enforcer is a ready to roll GAK system.  The visibility principle is good but is an entirely separable issue.
Yes, it is better than a government arranged "key recovery" key
If the OpenPGP standard is to include the GAK compliancy features, and
these competing systems use this standard, as long as the sum of the
OpenPGP compliant systems gets to 80% (or whatever) it doesn't matter
whether this is mostly provided by PGP, or mostly by GAK sellout
companies like IBM, or TIS.  It is a dangerous development to have a
largely fielded compatible set of GAK compliant products, whoever the
providers are.
Email encryption needs to be standardised, otherwise people can't talk
to each other.  This suggests to me that one standard _will_ evolve as
the winner, or if there are other standards, they will be backwards
compatible to this main standard.  A very related example of this kind
of principle in action is the fact that most secured web traffic is
secured by Netscape's SSL.
The French Government used require licenses for crypto, which were
hard to come by, and crypto without licenses was illegal.  In that
framework you couldn't see them liking PGP period.
More recently they have been swaying towards allowing crypto without
licenses, but only if it is GAK compliant.  PGP 5.5 & SMTP policy
enforcer should be a sell out.  Maybe y'all should pitch it to the
French government and SCSII (their NSA).
That's simple: you already have the mechanism, just put one of those
attributes Jon described on the key stating this fact.
Glad to hear it.  Can we take it from that that PGP won't be arguing
for the GAK compliancy flag Jon Callas described to be part of the
standard then?  This is needed for said non "message recovery" base
client product to also be OpenPGP compliant.
CMR keys and the way that PGP has designed their associated flags and
the SMTP policy enforcer app are what make PGP GAK compliant.  Also there are clear security advantages to _never_ send
communications encrypted to two keys.  There are clear security
advantages to separating the functionality of storage and
communications keys.  Communications keys are the most sensitive of
all, and should have the shortest life times.  In some applications
this could be minutes.
The PGP bashing PGP observes is an attempt by the pro-privacy crypto
community to influence PGP to re-think the GAK compliancy, and to
point out the more secure way to implement corporate recovery of
stored email messages without GAK compliancy.
I reserve the right to bash any company which attempts to field GAK
compliant software.
If PGP wants to make an additional stance against GAK here are my
1. remove GAK compliancy fields
2. scrap SMTP GAK compliancy policy enforcer app
3. separate storage and communications keys 4. use shorter lived communications keys giving forward secrecy
5. implement corporate recovery of stored mail folders with escrowed
   storage keys
Forward secrecy is _the_ strongest statement you could possibly make
against GAK.

@_subject: negative security aspects of GAK compliance 
I also was pondering this question as to which purpose the current
"encryption key" could be used for; should it become the
"communications key", or should it be the "storage key".
Clearly it could be used for either; and is in fact currently used for
both, which is where the security problem arises.
What you have described (very clearly as always) is the case for
making the current "encryption key" the "communications key".  You are
forced to make this choice because there is only one key available,
and without a communications key .. well you can't communicate :-)
However this leaves the question: what do you use for a "storage key"?
To see why this argument is important, you can see that you have
painted yourself into a corner where you will be forced to admit that
you need to have separate storage and communications keys.  Probably
this doesn't bother you as you didn't react adversely to my earlier
description of how it was a good idea to separate key functionality.
Let me quote:
It is indeed.  It is also very good for another reason: it allows
corporate escrow of encryption keys without simultaneously allowing
the company to forge signatures.
However you have created a problem for your self in the following
argument which suggests that you must have two encryption keys; one
for storage and one for communication.  It also suggests that my
method for achieving corporate recovery of email is better acheived
without the GAK compliancy field (second recipient) which was my
earlier point.
By doing it this way you do claw back some of the security lost by
having a second crypto recipient, as you say.  However you now can't
recover communications past the expiry date of the short lived
corporate key.
As the whole point of corporate message recovery is to guarantee
message recovery of stored messages (or at least this is the user
requirement Jon Callas gave in his post explaining the need for CAK),
you have just thrown away much of that ability.  This is an extreme
pity because you are now faced with a dilemma.
Your dilemma is, do you:
a) use short lived encryption keys (for both user and corporate master
key), and have good security but limited recovery of stored encrypted
email after that short period.  Also the poor user won't be able to
even access, never mind recover his stored encrypted email!
b) or do you use a long term encryption key for the corporate master
key, and hence good recovery of stored encrypted email, but poorer
security (and as an additional disincentive end up building a GAK
compliant system.)
This dilemma highlights really very well my point as to why you really
do need separate storage and encryption keys.  Introduce them, and
both problems vanish.
You can then:
- Have short term communications keys for the employee
- Have long term storage keys for the user escrowed with the company
- Have long term key recovery storage key for the company
It's beautiful, everything falls into place, and it's more secure.
Also as a convenient side-effect the way that you build a corporate
stored message recovery scheme under this system is non-GAK compliant,
which saves you from being screamed at by cypherpunks, and from being
dissed in the NYT and other places.  Presumably given Jonathan
Seybolds clear statement of PGP's aims:
this side-effect of removing the GAK compliancy should therefore be
very pleasing to PGP also.
The way that you implement corporate recovery of stored encrypted
messages once you accept the clear need for separate communications
and storage keys is easily derivable from new the key purposes.  It is
basically as easy to circumvent as the previous GAK compliant method.
Several PGP employees commenting on this didn't seem to think
enforceability was that big a deal.  (I agree with them: if all it
takes is to super encrypt with PGP itself, it's not worth losing sleep
Here's how to do corporate recovery of stored encrypted messages, now
with the new separated storage and communications key functionality:
1. Corp. employee receives encrypted email, the email is encrypted to
the employee's short life time communications key.
- employee decrypts email with pgp5.6 client
- pgp5.6 client encrypts the plaintext to users long term storage
  key, and to the companies recovery key as a second
  "storage-recipient", and places in received mail folder
2. Corp. employee sends encrypted email
- The pgp5.6 mail client encrypts plaintext of email to users long
  term storage key and to the companies long term storage recovery key
  and stores in the sent email folder
- The pgp5.6 mail client encrypts the plaintext of the email to the
  recipients short lived communications key and passes on to the MTA
3. Normal user access of encrypted stored email
- user's email client decrypts stored email with users storage key
3. User forgets password, or dies, or leaves in a huff, company needs
access to stored email
- company uses company recovery key to decrypt users stored email
An alternate set up would be to escrow the users long term storage key
with the company.  Basically equivalent.  But I think it is probably
easier to use multiple recipient as it saves the headaches of having
to securely transmit 10000 users storage keys securely.  Much easier
to install the software with the department/company recovery key bound
into it, and to remote update the company recovery key by fetching the
new from the company key server when it expires.
There are lots of other issues of course, with regard to architecture
of recovery setup.  However there is a basic equivalence between key
escrow and session key recovery methods, and you can acheive all kinds
of departmental escrow jus the same as you could with the previous
I can't see any reason why you would not be able to entirely automate
and hide the process of generating new communications keys every week,
every day, or _every communication_.
The process can be handled automatically by the software.
With El Gamal you have a very computationally cheap way to generate
keys other than the first key; discard the private components, and
treat the public modulus as a pre-computed prime as you currently do
for the fast key generation option on EG key generation.
I feel somewhat better about this post than previous ones; I haven't
been rude to PGP, and I feel some progress has been made in clarifying
things.  Perhaps it's just interacting with Hal, who always was one of
the most level headed people on cypherpunks; it's much harder to pick
faults in what he says, and he doesn't make ill thought out political
I think there are still some issues to resolve if we start to talk
about "per communication" communication key updates, but for per week,
or per month or whatever, I think the above is good.

@_subject: the GAK meme war: beware of NewSpeak and Minitru memes (was Re: Is Adam Back falling for one of Minitru's tricks?) 
I'm all ears to such an alarming prospect.  I also respect the
Journeyman's insights (to return the compliment :-)
We have to be watchful that we don't start using NewSpeak, and to not
get inadvertently drawn into perpetuating the GAKkers insidious false
memes -- often out-right fallacies -- spread by the GAKkers as part of
their mandatory GAK campaign.  It is often staggering how successful
the GAKkers are in spreading these memes, given each GAKker meme's
inherent fallacy once it is examined at all closely.  Often the terms
the GAKkers choose for their memes are hijacked existing technical
terms with nice wholesome sounding rings to them.  "key escrow", "key
recovery", etc.
Even in these circles, on cypherpunks, we see it.  People using the
NewSpeak terms "key escrow", "key recovery".  Having the press release
their memes as "news", and having the press give the photogenic chief
GAK spokesperson Freeh lots of air time helps the GAKkers cause no
end.  The "four horsemen of the infocalypse" being the GAKkers other
favourite false meme -- that you can prevent criminals using crypto by
restricting the law abiding populace's access to non GAKked crypto.
And another false meme is that export controls are designed to stop
terrorists obtaining crypto -- what they are designed to do is hinder
companies building in crypto, by with-holding 50+% of the market place
for strong crypto from US companies, and by spreading FUD.
The efforts of Tim May and others to provide alternate non-NewSpeak
terms and to propagate those helps a lot.  Cypherpunks have had some
success in this area.  Carl Ellison's 'GAK' acronym is doing well,
other cypherpunks PR wins being the Big Brother Inside logo & sticker
campaign, KRAP acronym (dumbly named by the GAKers themselves: Key
Recovery Alliance Program).  Also "four horsemen of the infocalypse".
(My reason for not attributing all these pro-crypto phrases and memes
is that I don't know where they all came from -- the majority I think
Tim is responsible for, but like all good memes they become part of
the langauge, like the rhetorical question "Who is John Galt?" in Ayn
Rand's novel.  People often don't know the origin).
Another succesful cypherpunks meme is to continue calling GAK GAK in
the face of new editions of the NewSpeak dictionary handed down from
DC, where new PR terms are given to new attempts at GAK.  For example,
first there was Clipper I, which backfired to the extent that
`Clipper' ended up meaning `big brother wants to read your mail, and
tap your phones'.  Then they tried a new name, cypherpunks called it
clipper II, which partly blew the GAKkers cover, as they were trying
to sneak it through under a different name.  We are now on Clipper IV,
or V, I've even lost count!  We're still calling it GAK, or Clipper
XII or wherever the count is.
Anyway, lets discuss Zooko's insights into this NewSpeak issue:
I agree with that 100%.  You can see that meme being spread in press
releases, and in quotes from Freeh etc.  Jon Callas was perpetuating
this meme in his post about PGP's controversial business snoopware.
The whole "key recovery" PR renaming of GAK was intended to exploit
this spin:
 "businesses need access to their information, therefore they need the
  government to have access to their communications".  Now hold-on-there one minute!  Why should businesses give the
government access to keys for recovering their own data?  Surely they
would keep backup copies of their own keys in their company safe, or
with their lawyer, or whoever the want!  Also (and it simply _amazes_
me that people do not notice this switch), companies data is on their
frigging disks! .. not flying around in transit bouncing between flaky
SMTP servers.  Lucky Green occasionally steps in to correct this myth.
Tim May did a nice expose of this myth yesterday.  The cunning GAKker
ploy that so called "escrow agents" or "trusted third parties" would
be "independent" was just so much fluff to divert criticism from
giving keys directly to government.  It means the same thing, and the
NSA reserves rights to the whole master key database anyway. (TTP
being another GAK term, an oxymoron if ever I heard one).
Yep agree.  So long as we're talking about escrow of data stored on
I do not believe there is a case for escrow of communications in
transit.  I have been arguing that the most secure, and least GAK
friendly way of implementing escrow of archived email communications
is to decrypt the communications and store them with an escrowed
storage key.
I agree with this statement also.
However some of the technical issues feed back into the political
process, and mean that it is dangerous to build certain types of
escrow systems, because they can be useful to GAKkers.  PGP Inc's
pgp5.5 and SMTP policy enforcer is 100% GAK ready.  It could be used
to implement a GAK system tomorrow, for example for the Chinese, or
Singaporeans who seem to want GAK, if PGP could export it to them.  We
_know_ the USG/NSA/FBI want to have mandatory GAK also.  Is it really
wise to hand them software and an installed user base on a plate like
So I am also arguing against systems which are GAK compliant in this
You will notice that a central theme for the GAKkers is that they want
to snoop communications, and so they naturally enough primarily want
access to communications keys.
Well this functionality is clearly not required for business data
recovery, nor even for recovery of archived email (when it is
re-encrypted with different storage keys, or just decrypted and stored
in plaintext).
So as long as you build corporate data recovery systems which truly
only recover storage keys, we're all fine and happy.
The meme that you need to have escrow of keys used to protect
communications in transit in order for a company to retain recovery
capability of it's employees mail folders is an especially tough one
to kill.  Even you, Zooko, and PGP Inc are guilty of that one.
One problem with this meme is it didn't have a label for a long time,
there was no term which described the problem, so it got lumped in
with CKE (Commercial Key Escrow) or CAK (Company Access to Keys) which
have much less negative overtones.  The chant "CAK good GAK bad" is
burnt into many peoples brains.
PGP Inc kindly provided a label for this problem, doubtless in their
minds at the time it was a friendly term: it is However there-in lies the precise same fallacy that the GAKkers are
promulgating with the "key escrow" and "key recovery" memes, that you
somehow need escrow of transient communication keys to access data
stored on your frigging disk!
PGP have propogated the GAKkers "key recovery" fallacy into the
corporate world with their CMR term, and GAKware implementation.  CMR
sounds reasonably palatable because they, like the GAKkers, chose it
to sound positive.  The sad thing is they probably didn't even realise
they were being fooled by the Minitru "key recovery" meme still, so
powerful was the meme that it blinded them to the falacy.
One problem with CMR is that it is a security flaw; it is bad security
practice to put second doors into transient communications, and that
it is GAK compliant.  And CMR is GAK compliant because if you do what
PGP have done with their CMR implementation, you have done want the
GAKkers want you to do with their "key recovery" and "key escrow"
campaigns.  You have implemented something which provide them on a
plate a really slick smooth migration path to mandatory GAK.
"GAK compliant" is the term I coined to express this aspect of the
problem with CMR.
We could kind of use a term for CMR which expressed it's negative
aspects, it is basically the technology the GAKkers want you to use
but being used for Companies.  This is what the GAKkers were trying to
do with the KRAP (Key Recovery Alliance Program) which was clipper
IV(?)  Only now PGP are inadvertently doing it for them.
Candidates which explain what CMR really is are Tim's "snoopware", or
perhaps "GAKware".  GAKware seems like a fair description, and is a
little harsher than snoopware.  It seems a fair description because it
is basically GAK enforcement technology being offered for sale to
companies under the guise of "data recovery".
The above is the point were we diverge, and I think it is you, Zooko,
who has been conned by Minitru, or at least by PGP Inc, which was in
turn conned by Minitru.
Now that we have the terms we can express the problem concisely:
- Company data recovery of stored data is good -- companies need
  availability of their data
- GAK is bad -- because GAK means governments wanting master snoop
  keys into your messages, so that they can keyword scan them on
  fishing expeditions
- GAKware used for commercial applications is bad, because it provides
  the GAKkers with a deployed software base
- GAK compliancy in GAKware/snoopware is bad because it provides the
  GAKkers with a smooth migration path from:
  where business GAK is the process PGP Inc are starting right now by
  deploying GAK compliant software.
- Companies should acheive recovery of encrypted stored copies of
  communications which are encrypted with transient communications
  keys by encrypted stuff on disks with "storage keys", and stuff in
  transit with "communications keys".
- Communications keys should be short lived, the shorter lived the
  better, because this is the antithesis of GAK: not only can the
  government not snoop your communications, but they can't get you to
  decrypt them afterwards, because you won't have they keys.  (Forward
  secrecy being basically that you delete keys after use, or after some
  tunable, relatively short time period, 1 hour, 1 week, etc)
Say no to PGP Inc GAKware.

@_subject: D-H Forward Secrecy for E-Mail? 
The keyservers using pgp2.x as the key lookup engine are struggling
because the database code isn't very good.  But the experimental MIT
keyserver, and Tage Stabell-Kulo's key server code on the key server
in Norway fairly whistle through key lookups.  PGP Inc also is using
the better keysever code -- I think based on the one at MIT
implemented by Marc (surname escapes me right now).
It all depends on how up to date you are on keyserver performance
problems; perhaps you are more up to date than myself, perhaps not.
The answer I think which must come in any case is a distributed key
server system because the current 100% replication method seems
unlikely to scale to likely future demands, with or without forward
secrecy.  If your company holds keys for it's employees on it's openly
accessible key server, this distribution will be very similar to DNS,
and similarly scalable.
I think this is taking it too far.  Have you considered how much
traffic DNS handles right now?  I would have thought it would be many
orders of magnitude more than forward secret email is going to cause.
Web traffic is the bulk of network communications, just imagine the
DNS lookups caused by 50 million netters clicking away. Bear in mind also hear that most users will probably be entirely
satisfied with a communications key update time of 1 week.  It is
probably mostly cypherpunks, or people with high value communications
to secure who would opt for more frequent key updates.
Bear in mind also that once the new key has been issued, you could
also release a deletion request for the previous one on the keyserver
in the form of a revocation certificate.
Nothing.  It is unaffected.  The WoT is only based on signature keys.
You personally certify your communication with your signature key.
Lots.  Consider: you are the average PGP user, you have one key
generated per year if you are lucky (probably more like once per life
time).  You are in a company, and the company has a heck of a time
persuading people not to use dumb passwords, or leave their passwords
on yellow sticky notes conveniently stuck to the corner of the
Scenario: the cleaner is bribed to switch on a machine with a supplied
boot floppy to put in the drive, and writes down the password on the
sticky note.
So, without forward secrecy the attacker now has all the traffic said
PGP user wrote in the life time of his encryption key.  What's that 1
years traffic?  (He'll have collected the ciphertext by eavesdropping
on SMTP traffic travelling over the internet).
With say once-a-day forward secrecy, the attacker gets nothing, no
previous communications, and no future communications.
Granted the attacker can install a replacement version of PGP to try
to get future traffic, but the company can run automated audit checks
of varying sophistications each morning to check if machines have been
switched on, and if files have been altered.  If tampering is
detected, or perhaps every morning you re-install the machine from
scratch remotely, as the MIT project did.  (Reckoned to be a human
resource efficient method of running networks -- got a problem with
your machine -- reload it, the lot no arguments).
Forward secrecy in a way is not something you need to argue about
adding or not as such, because in a sense you've already got it, built
in to pgp5.0.
To see what I mean you'd need to read Hal Finney's recent post on the
OpenPGP list, where he described how you could already achieve forward
secrecy using the fact that you've got a separate encryption key and
signature key.
You just set the encryption key to have a short expiry, and generate a
new one when it does expire.  You sign the encryption keys with your
signature key to transfer the WoT based trust to them.
The only extra functionality I am arguing for over what PGP5.0 already
has is some built in support for this type of usage, so that pgp will
manage the generation of new keys at the key expiry point
transparently.  That much as such doesn't need any modifications to
the current PGP standard.  It's an implementation issue.  Another
vendor could easily already implement this type of functionality.
Also I'm arguing for separate communications and storage keys, I think
this is almost essential once PGP starts to work with escrow schemes,
because there are similar arguments for separating storage and
communications keys as there were for creating separate signature and
encryption keys from the original single key.
Actually I hear Fred Piper was semi-seriously arguing for this ... his
argument went like this: mass storage is cheap and getting cheaper
fast; often the communications needed could be covered for years worth
of comms between to organisations by exchanged of a small read only
storage device.  Simple, and fool proof, etc.  But I digress.
I know, convenient for implementing this type of feature.
I was also arguing for support for once per message forward secrecy.
You should like that one because I was arguing that this should be
done with out keyservers.  Just send the key to the person your
communicating in the email you would like a forward secret reply to.
I also personally prefer people to send me keys in email, because the
pay per second phone lines here at home mean that I tend want to avoid
doing too many online key lookups, so I think this would be an
individually useful feature.

@_subject: IETF policy on refusing to allow politics to weaken protocols(Re: Why Adam Back keeps politicizing technical issues) 
I must admit some ignorance of the IETF processes due to my only
understandings being gained from intermittent following of the IPSEC
standardisation process, and in that respect I thank you for the data
However, I would defend that my understanding is, and my point was
more that proposals with trial implementations should be used as
discussion points, and as competing draft proposals rather than being
used as arguments for it being necessary to build compatibility with
just because someone has rushed off and sold copies of them, prior to
ratification of those proposals by the standardisation process.  And
that independently of the technical merits of those proposals, or
arguably even in the face of evidence that there are more secure
alternatives to these proposals.
The IETF standardisation process is supposed to make decisions based
on technical merit.  Not based on marketing clout.  Nor even based on
reputation capital, something which PGP surely has in abundance, as
transferred to it by Phil Zimmermann with his virtual net.god status.
I also take exception to PGP's Will Price's attempt at silencing
negative discussion of the security and political aspects of PGP's
GAKware, in his rhetoric on this being an inappropriate forum for
discussion of political aspects of CMR.  If Will Price thinks that we
should just lie down and accept PGP fielding inferior security GAKware
systems, and accept PGP trying to impose them on the standard, he can
think again.  Crypto politics can't help but play some part in
discussion of crypto standards.  As Tim May pointed out in an earlier post, we gave the same roasting
to companies participating in the Key Recovery Alliance Program, and
to companies like TIS, and IBM for various GAK sell out deals.  In
fact, Netscape got worse roastings for far lesser crimes than PGP's
crimes in attempting to architect GAKware into the OpenPGP standard,
or if that fails, in PGP's death wish in attempting to commit
reputational suicide by implementing and widely deploying GAKware.
My concern specifically is that some of the less desirable aspects of
the way that PGP have implemented CMR should not be adopted into the
standard for interoperability reasons alone.  I am worrying that PGP
Inc will shortly be using this line of reasoning, for backwards
compatibility with pgp5.5 functionality for similar reasons as one
might reasonably argue for backwards compatibility with pgp2.x.
I noticed that Ian Grigg (Systemics) also expressed this point about
standards process manipulation well in his article.
Systemics has a much better track record for open development, and
openness of design decisions than PGP Inc since it's incorporation, or
before that than the pgp3.0 development team of two in beetling
themselves off in a room at Sun or wherever and taking ages to develop
software.  (No offense intended to said developers technical ability,
which I respect immensely, the error was organisational.)
Systemics is also outside of the US and for that reason better placed
to compete internationally.  PGP Inc is losing reputation capital to
Systemics and other such small companies in eroding it's support from
netizens by fielding GAKware systems.
(I have no affiliation with Systemics).

@_subject: mailing list attacks (was Re: Stronghold) 
One additional reason to believe that at least some things were
disappearing from the unedited list was Attila's claim that some of
his posts weren't getting through to the unedited list also.
Notice that I don't say why they were disappearing because that is
almost difficult to prove at this point.  I detailed Attila's claims
in the post you are replying to.
Mailing lists are pretty vulnerable to spoofing in various ways.  At
the time of the attack, an additional possible class of spoof which
may or may not have been occuring would have been:
For someone to use the list of subscribers available for the lists
homed at majordomo @ toad.com to fuck with peoples minds.  For example
by sending messages with forged From & other headers making them
appear as if they did come from toad.com to all subscribers, or some
subset of them.
That would allow one to construct some very interesting problems: for
example Sandy apparently passing to the edited list something which
seemed violently out of character, but sending it to everyone but him,
so that he would deny seeing it even, and look like every one else as
if he were blatantly lying.
Or to generally mess with who you sent to for different lists and
combinations of lists.  This would allow you to construct all sorts of
apparently independently confirmable conspiracy theories.
I'm not sure some of these things weren't happening.  There are a few
current and former list members who delight in this kind of clever
Reckon you could do something about some of these attacks by adding
signatures on outgoing mail from the mailing list, and by posting
regular message digests of posts to the list to make it harder for
people to deny service to one individual.
Even unsubscribing and subscribing other people was not prevented
originally with toad, but there are existing methods to solve this
problem in that newer versions of majordomo allow nonces to be sent
for confirmations of these things.  Doesn't stop recursive list
subscriptions, nor subscribing one list to another (because the
attacker can see the nonce appear in the list).

@_subject: D-H Forward Secrecy for E-Mail? 
Your argument neglects that it was you who was arguing for DNS
distribution of keys.  I was never too keen on this idea.  Your
descriptions of the near breaking point reaffirms my dislike, though
I'm not sure I agree with your crash and burn predictions.  Mind, DNS
maintenance is not something I have a great deal of familiarity with.
My comparison was intended to be "implementing forward secrecy by
storing comms keys on keysevers using ad-hoc distribution of
distributed keyservers would cause orders of magnitude less traffic in
total than current DNS requests".  I think that sounds entirely
By ad-hoc distribution of key-servers I mean key servers which don't
have replication but rather store keys for some designated set of
users within a set of domains.  The DNS would be a good place to store
the resolving mechanism for deciding where the keyservers live.
Similar perhaps to the way you use a DNS MX record to find a mail
exchanger for the domain name you're trying to send to.  Use DNS
keyserver extension record to find keyserver IP address.
With that architecture, the whole thing sounds pretty scalable, and
adds negligble extra overhead to the DNS system.  Storing the keys
themselves directly into DNS is something people get interested in for
IPSEC, and for that application it seems more reasonable.
My thoughts also.  In fact for particularly short lived keys I have a
scheme worked out where key servers are not used at all.  I haven't
really described this scheme yet, as people seem to be raising enough
objections over the logical uses of current PGP functionality.
Well I thought it was a neat idea.  Perhaps that is because you have
the world view that every email recipient has a direct IP or at least
a dialup with flat rate connection charge, and also another reason I
thought it was neat was because I was considering it as a mechanism to
enable per message forward secrecy in a manner which I still haven't
explained in any detail.
Yeah, well perhaps it wasn't that great an example.  However you can
see that extra security is being imparted even into this less than
ideal scenario.  These security problems are representative of the
problems some real life businesses face.  Most company employees do
not extract as much fun from the arcane fine points of best security
practice as we do.  They probably view security as an inconvenient
imposition, forcing them to learn things they don't want to know
Ooh no.  It's not gone at all.  I think you are being a tad closed-
minded here.
If you have excellent security practice, you are still vulnerable to a
number of attacks which my proposal gives extra protection from:
1. being blackmailed, or having the password for your encryption key
   with 1 year expiry period rubber-hosed from you
2. having a keyboard sniffer installed by the Feds burgling your house
   whilst you are out.
3. having a virus installed by an attacker remotely or directly
   infecting your machine
With all 3 of these cases your security is blown wide open, despite
your 100 bit entropy pass-phrase and crypto-anarchist 'tude: "you'll
get my key when you pry it my cold dead fingers", and apparent
reasonable security precautions you will have blown your security.  If
your key had a 1 year expiry that might mean the Feds get up to 1
year's worth of the plaintext from the encrypted traffic they had been
meticulously collecting from their collaboration with invweb.net.
Now consider what happens to the above attacks when you have forward
1. blackmail/rubberhose .. it's kind of hard to not notice black mail
   or having passwords rubber hosed from you.  So as you have used my
   recommendations of the most paranoid forward secrecy setting (1 new
   key per message, sent in message) the attacker gets zip.  He gets
   nothing.  With a key update time of 1 day, your attacker gets up to
   one days plaintext, or with 1 week update up to 1 weeks comms.
2. keyboard sniffer .. presuming that you don't notice it, the
   attacker gets traffic going forward in time, but doesn't get old
   traffic
3. virus .. presuming that you don't notice it, the attacker gets
   traffic going forward in time, but doesn't get old traffic
I think that is a security advantage, wouldn't you agree?
There are quite a lot of precedents for using forward secrecy... for
example SSH, SSL, and some of the IPSEC protocols.  They aren't using
forward secrecy for phun, they're using it to increase security also.
Granted it's easier to do interactive forward secrecy with IP
connections than email, but forward secrecy is just another term which
describes something we are all already very familiar with: key expiry.
Consider why does PGP provide you with a mechanism to expire keys.
The reason is because it's acknowledged that it's a good idea to
change the keys now and then -- because this provides you with forward
secrecy -- the longer you use the same key the more the risk that it
is compromised accumulates, and the more value it will have to the
attacker because of the larger number of messages it is protecting.
So all I am really saying is that shorter key expiry times give you
more security... not that radical a statement I don't think.
Heh.  Well there is where we part company then, because I do think
hiding some parts of the crypto innards where this is appropriate is a
good thing.  I think the generation of new transient keys is one such
You are already using this mechanism every day anyway: your SSL
enabled web browser will be setting up key exchanges using short lived
communications keys with secure web servers.  You do see notices when
you haven't agreed to trust this organisation before, but you will
observer that netscape asks you if you would like to trust this
organisation this session only, or for all further sessions.
What I am proposing is the same "for all further sessions", applied to
PGP.  I reckon it is more secure because you have the PGP WoT to help
guide you in your decisions, where as I currently find a lot of web
sites using uncertified server keys, and I'm not sure how much
security the very limited numbers of hierarchical server certifcate
issuers provide in practice.  I prefer the PGP WoT where I can get
face to face transfer of keys with people.  The trust is much more
I agree with you there.  That is way the most appropriate place to put
storage encryption.  However (and this is my point also in another
form), if you were to do this, you would want to use a different key
than the one you use for protecting communications keys, because the
storage key may have different expiry requirements, and different
escrow requirements.
But... we have a circular dependency in our argument here, because
when I was arguing that you didn't need to encrypt the contents of
your mail folders 10 messages back or so, you jumped in and said that
you kept email communications encrypted in your mail folder.
I accepted your point, and countered that if you wanted to encrypt
messages in your mail folder, that you should use a storage key to do
so.  (Otherwise you couldn't sensibly make use of the expiry feature
on your communications key, as when your comms key expired, so would
your access to your mailbox!)
I agree with your above suggestion that it is actually easier, safer
etc, to use disk level encryption systems.  However I do think we have
to face that these are not that widely deployed yet, and that people
like yourself a few days back are correct in arguing that there may be
a case for building the functionality of encryption of stored traffic
in folders.  As PGP Inc is fielding integrated Mail clients which have
mail folders managed by the mail client, this gives us the case for
separate storage and communications keys.
This also gives a convenient place to put escrow -- you escrow the
storage key.
This implementation would completely avoid all arguments about PGP 5.5
being GAKware.
A clever optimisation to be sure.
I don't have a key cache, and my keyring is only 216k.  But I'm
curious about your automated process .. are you also checking all
signatures that you can by downloading the keys and checking out the
WoT for all received mailing list traffic etc?  This would cleary
result in a much bigger key ring.
Good optimisation.  It sounds really as if your OS/2 setup is more
advanced than a lot of other stuff around.
My setup is GNU emacs with Pat LoPresti's mailcrypt.el PGP and
remailer support lisp extension for emacs RMAIL and emacs GNUS
(newsreader).  I love it to bits.  It is totally excellent.  It
doesn't have a couple of your optimisations, but other than that it's
pretty good.  When you send messages, if you don't have the key it
will fetch it for you by trying keyservers, then finger user at domain.
It can snarf keys out of mail messages, paste keys into them, sign,
encrypt, check signatures, use remailers (type I and mixmaster).

@_subject: Auto-archiving cleartext is GAK 
Anonymous gives some more good feed back on the PGP GAK argument.  A
real battle of wits here, anonymous appears to be a pro, probably a
PGP employee, anonymous doesn't miss anything (apart from the fact
that he has apparently swallowed whole the "communications key
recovery" fallacy being spread by the GAKkers).
Hmm, you've turned that argument on it's head there, and come up with
an interesting counter point.
I'm not sure it's that valuable a distinction though, because you
can't enforce it either way.  You really have no idea what the
recipients software is doing, nor who the recipient is printing out
and showing your email to.
I think that the best that can be hoped for is that it is considered
fair play, and a convention that businesses are encouraged to adopt,
that second reader policy, and storage policy is flagged.
Following from your concerns it would seem we currently have 3
possible "how I treat email" flags:
- email is readable by company
- email is being archived for company records
- email is being archived in the clear
- email is discarded after reading
Interestingly pgp 2.x has an option to partially suggest that last
one, a kind of "don't save in clear" request (from pgp.hlp in pgp263i):
Use -m to force display of plaintext only (no output file)
I know one person who used to regularly send me stuff encrypted this
way -- it used to cause my mail client to barf (emacs RMAIL &
mailcrypt.el) because it couldn't cope with this, so I had to manually
read it with the command line pgp, which would insist on displaying it
to you with it's pager, and not storing it to file.
Quite a nice privacy touch.
Anyway you used your point to argue that:
which I take to mean that you are using that to argue that the PGP
GAKware enforcement feature is a good idea.
I strongly disagree because a) communications keys should be shorter
lived than storage keys, b) the way the PGP GAKware enforcement and
flags are implemented is literally an full GAK implementation, c) that
it is less secure to put extra doors into what should be for security
reasons short lived keys.
Notifying senders of the archiving and access policy is good and to be
encouraged, however it never proves anything about what is actually
happening to your email, nor can it.
I don't think this is true.  They will have no more proof that this is
the case than they will have with the storage recovery key solution.
Consider: the company could just as easily take copies of the email
after the user decrypts it with CMR.
The user may have an _expectation_ that there is no third party
access, but they can only hope that their expectation tallies with the
truth of the situation, and this is the case for either my storage
recovery solution, or PGP's CMR solution.
So there are no meaningful differences from this angle.
There are two major and definately meaningful differences between
corporate storage recovery (CSR) and CMR:
- CMR is a fully functional GAK implementation CSR is not
  This is directly analogous to the difference between GAK and data
  recovery, and was the reason the cypherpunks that Jon Callas
  observed chanting "key recovery bad data recovery good" where
  chanting.  The irony was Jon didn't realise that he was falling for
  the GAKker promulgated fallacy that these cypherpunks were chanting
  against, and yet he was using the same chant in his arguments not
  realising what it meant.
- CSR is more secure because:
  a) it allows shorter lived communications keys
  b) because it leaves no long term doors into communications, whereas
     CMR leaves two doors into communications
You have no guarantees either way.  You can implement any
functionality for storage, escrow, and message snooping with varying
loose degrees of tamper resistance into either CSR or CMR, using a
combination of storage key escrow (CSR) and Mail client enforcement or
GAKware (CMR) with the session key going over the wire encrypted to
the GAK master key.
As I said above, the best we can do is to encourage truth in
advertising about storage policy and number of people who can read;
and to provide flags to express these meanings within the OpenPGP
Wew.  Hadn't thought of it that way.  Well you could choose to
implement it that way, or you chose not to at your option.  It hadn't
even entered my head to implement it that way! and I would strongly
argue against so doing.  (I am starting to appreciate how PGP people
must feel about my criticisms of their features; never-the-less, I am
confident that my argument is correct, and it is they who have allowed
themselves to be blinded by the GAKkers fallacy of escrowing
communications keys (the chanting cypherpunks mantra explained above)).
However, and this shows how you can still trivially hack around it,
you could super encrypt to a key which wasn't storage escrowed.
I also have said things about "official email" and "unofficial email"
which I considered companies should be encouraged to provide for their
employees, and there is a case to be made for this as argued by Tim
May and Bill Frantz recently, which is that it is probably not in the
companies interests.
I originally started out thinking that companies didn't as such need
much in the way of access to old email messages, or that they could
store them in the clear and encrypt the whole disk with recoverable
storage keys.  However some tenacious people (you?) started arguing
that it would be a security breach to store email in the clear after
having encrypted it for communications.  There is also the case to
consider of the PGP Inc mail client which does not integrate disk
storage functionality.
Therefore I was worked out a sample architecture demonstrating that
you could archive email in encrytped form if you wanted to acheive
this without needing GAK compliant architectures such as CMR.
I would also defend myself from the above slur that I was trying extra
hard to ensure that there is no escape from super encryption.
I have lots of ammunition, don't worry :-)
The reason that I am trying to demonstrate that you can enforce any of
this at all, is that some of the GAKware proponents on the list
(anonymous and not) argue that it is necessary not just to have access
to communications keys for data recovery purposes to ensure data
availability (there's that recurring fallacy again), but also that it
should be possible for the company to snoop on the user without the
user being able to avoid this.
If you are at all worried that your GAKware CMR system doesn't quite
meet up with the flexibility of my system in allowing you to get all
little brotherish and enforce things, well I can make a suggestion as
to how to increase the enforcement rate of your GAKware system.
Do a web search on "Binding Cryptography" by a guy called Bert-Jaap
Koops, and a couple of co-authors (I think another of the authors is
the main author, but I don't remember their names right now.)  I was
particularly disappointed at the time with Bert-Jaap for allowing his
name to be put on a paper describing a technology which has only one
purpose: GAK enforcement, and expressed this to him.  However I
suppose technology is neutral -- it is what you use it for that is the
problem, probably it could have some other uses.
So, y'all PGP Inc GAK lovers will love what this allows: it allows you
to enforce at your GAKware big brotherish SMTP policy enforcer app on
the inbound direction that not only is the El Gamal key with the
correct key-id there in the GAK master key second recipient, but that
the same session key is in use inside of the users PKE packet.
Not that I'm suggesting that you do that or anything, I merely draw it
to your attention to demonstrate my point that either of the systems
can be implemented in varying amounts little brotherishness, but that
the over-riding point still remains that CMR is a fully functional GAK
system where-as CSR is functionally useless for GAKkers because they
want to read your communications, not what is stored on your disk.
This is because the GAKkers will have to break in to your building to
get your disk, this is not nearly enough fun for the Feds, because
they kind of fancied having push button remote key word scans of the
entire world communications.
(Remember the meme the chanting cypherpunks were trying to promulgate
as described above: governments want access to comms keys, businesses
want access to storage keys.  This cypherpunks meme is absolutely
central to the whole argument).
You are indeed an observant anonymous person!  I'm obviously dealing
with an extremely bright person, even if he seems to have swallowed
the inherent fallacy of the communications "key recovery" meme which
the GAKkers are promulgating.
I too fretted over this possibility.  And this is why I tried to avoid
the idea that you would have a central company archive of stored
encrypted email.  I couldn't work out a way to ensure that the
communications which were intended to occur inside the corporate LAN
could be prevented from being abused to implement GAK, a problem that
you so observantly spotted also.
Aside from being awkward and implementing it with screwy transfer
protocols so that it was all non-standard, it seems inherently
difficult to avoid.
So firstly I switched to contenting myself with satisfying what PGP
Inc claimed the user requirements for CMR where.  To me this meant
that centralised backup would have to be avoided to avoid GAK
compliance.  You could argue independently that not doing this is far
less little brotherish anyway.  Also that you can enforce to some
reasonable degree storage on the local machine, to give second access
to the users mail folder, which is better than having a central
snoopware HQ, which can then be perverted to become NSA GAKware HQ.
(Granted the employee could purposely trash the disk by taking it out
and breaking it -- but you'd still have backups from the last backup
point -- and we're not after 100% success rate because there are other
easier ways to bypass the system).
Jon Callas claimed the main company requirement for data recovery was
for companies to be able to retain data availability.  So if we take
him at face value, that presumably means that companies don't
especially want high assurance snoop functionality to read email where
recipients refuse to decrypt it, or go to extra efforts like
super-encryption.  Jon Callas and other PGP employees also argued as a
plus point for the CMR design that it was easy to bypass.  This
suggested that users could deny company data availability in a number
of ways, and that PGP employees wouldn't be losing sleep over that.
Well CSR achieves all that.  You can hack it in various basically
analogous ways that you can hack CMR.
Now, as I describe above, the reason that I started talking about
tamper proof clients was to demonstrate to those who complained of
loss of company ability to snoop in the face of a company employee
hostile to the snooping.  If you don't like that (and I sure as fuck
don't), well don't build the little brotherism in either.
But, if you do want to have some kind of mildly enforceable corporate
snoopware well you can do it with reencryption to an escrowed storage
key or to a key recovery storage key.
For people who want to stop employees beyond that I think it is
reasonable to say that this is disproportionate effort spent on the
problem given other physical avenues for company information leaks.
If a company is that way inclined that could say that attempts to
subvert the snoopware was a sackable offense.  (Again not that I'm
arguing we should be encouraging companies to do any of these things,
but rather than in proposing the CSR method as a non GAK compliant
replacemnt for CMR, I am being challenged to demonstrate it can do
everything that CSR can do with similar levels of enforceability).
He could prevent as I argued above; also you could build more secure
and similarly hard to bypass GAKware (CMRware) with Binding
Cryptography and a restriction to El Gamal keys.  Anway I would
strongly argue against fielding a system which worked in this way, for
the exact same reasons that I am arguing against PGP Inc's fielding of
the CMR system: because as you so rightly and observantly point out it
is GAK.  (I am not noticing you say much about CMR being GAK
... perhaps you actually acknowledge it is GAK, but are trying (and I
think failing) to show that CSR is GAK too.  Well no dice, I think CSR
allows non GAK compliant functionality with a large degree of
flexibility.  CMR on the other hand just _is_ GAKware.  If you
remember the KRAP (Key Recovery Alliance Program) and have the
documents handy I am sure that if you go down the checklist that you
will find that pgp5.5 matches just about all of the hotly contested
NSA given requirments.
Lets think this through.  You have 3 keys.
- storage keys
- signature keys
- communications keys
You can escrow storage keys if you want -- this provides data
availability.  As an alternate and approximately equivalent mechanism
you can use storage key recovery (with a second storage recipient).
Signature keys we shouldn't have any arguments about I think because
y'all presumably agree that the user should be the only hodler of
those to prevent third parties forging his signature.
Communications keys, for security, and non-GAK compliant design
reasons you also should not escrow.
I think that your complaint is the same as that raised by someone
else, that is if some emails come in and in the mean time the employee
forgets his passphrase, you lose the emails because you can't recover
the communications key, because it is treated like signature keys; no
escrow, no backup.
This is a valid complaint.
However as a fob to the significance of this I can offer:
- if the email is important value "official communications" as you
  suggest, it might be an idea for the sender to archive them anyway
  in case they disappear down a blackhole in transit, or it will be
  independently likely that the important company document / figures /
  source code will be stored on the senders disk somewhere.
It's the only down side I can see for the system, which allows you to
avoid GAK compliancy.  It also has a number of quite major security
advantages which I discussed with William Geiger in the thread on DH
forward secrecy in email.
You could do this as a solution.  However it has GAK problems, and has
as you say Clipper overtones, using the same master access method.
However you could also view it this way: you will likely be encrypting
the private parts of the communications key with the same passphrase
as the private parts of the signature key.  If the user forgets their
signature passphrase you'll have to issue them with a new set of
certificates for their newly generated signature key.  This is also
inconvenient, but you live with it because of the over-riding
principle that signature keys should only be held by individuals.
With communications keys the main reason not to escrow them is that
doing so builds a GAK system.  Thus is harder to argue that these
restrictions are inherently necessary unless you want to avoid GAK so
much that you are willing to live with this weakness.
I'll think on this part to see if I can find some way to tune down the
significance of this type of data loss.  Do you have any ideas?
One which comes to mind is smart cards for key tokens.  Harder to
forget.  Still you _can_ lose them.
There is however a separate danger with smart cards, they are kind of
a form of escrow themselves if they are not tamper-proof enough
because someone with resources may be able to recover the keys from
Smart cards are however very convenient for key storage.
Yeah I believe you.  Some folks don't give a shit about privacy, nor
about GAK.  The $ is all that counts to them.  Selling their mother
for a bit of change wouldn't cause them a second thought.
The difference is still centered around the central fallacy that the
GAKkers are promulgating that the government should be allowed to have
access to all of your communication keys to allow the company to
protect data availibility.
The problem is that your disk is not stored in those communications,
so having the communications key back from the government key recovery
infrastructure does nothing to help you recover your disk data in
event of a disk crash.
In addition my simple observations derived from this are that well:
- if government is so damn keen on gaining access to communications
  keys, we'd better make damn sure we have no data on disk encrypted
  with communications keys!
- if government is so damn keen on encouraging companies to build GAK
  products (clipper, tessera, KRAP (Key Recovery Alliance Program)
  Public Key Infrastructure ("CAs" with copies of communications keys,
  as if you want them backed up)), well I'm going to do my damnest to
  make sure that I don't write the software.  If PGP Inc chooses not
  to write a GAK compliant product, and the PGP standard is
  successful, well then we have done all we can to frustrate
  government GAK plans
Given those observations, lets take a look at this claim:
I'm trying.  Your feed back is helping to explore the limitations and
flexibilites of CSR as new scenarios are explored.
Well it's a little brotherish sort of activity perhaps, but some argue
that companies have property rights which you could use to conclude
that if they are paying for your time, and they own the machines, and
the networking facilities, that perhaps this isn't so unreasonable.
Provided you stick to data stored on disks you minimise your problems
of being accuesed of GAK.
I have given you a CSR architecture which is non GAK compliant.  Your
task is to deploy this as widely as you can.  Then with 80% of
companies using non GAK compliant software, the GAKkers are going to
be struggling.
The other scenario, PGP Inc's CMR, is already GAK enabled.  It
provides a smooth migration path to GAK.  With 80% of companies using
that type of GAK compliant software we're screwed.  PGP will be the
guilty party.
There can be legitimate reasons for restrictions on privacy within
companies where this is required to ensure data availability.  The
main points about this are that a) you recommend the policy of
informing users (ensuring that they know that the data on this disk is
backed up, that this email folder is backed up etc.) b) that PGP
doesn't use the excuse that a GAK system _could_ be built by
perverting CSR as an excuse to fields something which is unavoidably a
GAK compliant system: CMR.  With CSR you as implementer and to a
certain extent standards setter have the power to do something about
having a non-GAK compliant installed software base.  With CMR you have
no choice but to implement and field GAK compliant software.
I don't think that is really fair.  My motives for exploring the
functionalities is driven by other peoples user requirements which
they are thrusting on me with the challenge that I show that they can
be met with CSR.  I have almost completely been able to show that this
can be done for the things which have been thrust at me.
This in no way indicates that I _like_, or approve of the little
brotherish, or snoopy things people are challenging me to show can be
implemented with CSR.
But what I am certain of is that you _can_ build a non-GAK compliant
system with CSR, which can have just about any functionality you care
to add (snooping, weakly enforced email archiving to recoverable keys,
separate "official" and "unofficial" email boxes, flexible storage key
recovery architecture).
I am also certain that CMR as implemented by PGP is a fully
functioning ready to roll GAK compliant system.
Lets try a different tack: I'll issue _you_ a challenge: can you
modfiy the CMR proposal so that it still achieves stored email data
recovery and so that it is no longer GAK compliant.
I don't think you can do it.  I'll be happy to be proven wrong.
I think you'll find as you try to work your way around away from GAK
compliance it that you will end up with something which _is_ CSR.
(Thanks for the long debate... I hope it has been useful).

@_subject: GET OFF THE DIME: PGP 5.5: Attitude 
_Of course_ we all agree that it is much better to have PGP Inc
implement a CAK system than IBM, HP, TIS or other GAK-sellout'ers.
Attila, I generally liked your rant, and agreed with pretty much most
of it.  However I would repeat what I said to Jon Callas with his
nicely written rant which started this thread on `attitude' (modified
for Attila rant relevance):
: [bucko big snip]
: : Well, it was a nice rant, Attila.  Most of it was even crypto-correct :-)
: : But the problem is you didn't address the point causing PGP's perceived
: hostilities.  Not once.
Now as you say above, if there was no choice on how to implement CAK,
well we'd all be forced to agree that PGP Inc hard no alternative but
to do what they have done and implement something which can be
directly used as a fully functional GAK system, because of the
requirement for company availability of data.  We'd feel unhappy about
it, as Jon Callas himself admitted of the CMR design but acknowledging
the user requirement and inevitability, in similar ways that you have
been arguing for.
We'd then be acknowledging the nice balances which PGP have put in as
expressed by PGP's Jon Callas and Jon Seybold respectively: the
principle of transparency: that PGP is recommending that companies
flag mail addresses which are "company use" mail boxes where the
company may be reading; and Jon Seybold's point about decentralised
company escrow designs being much better than centralised ones.  Both
are very good points.
The point is that, _of course_ we acknowledge these points; that is a
complete no-brainer.
_This_ is the point I am trying to get across:
- If you (as a crypto software company) have users who have a
  requirement for data recovery of stored email (and there is a pretty
  reasonable business case for this), then as a company which claims
  to be against the dangers of mandatory GAK, you should do everything
  you can to make your system non-useful to the GAKkers purposes.  PGP
  has done somethings in this direction (the two points I list above
  for example).  But they could do more:
- I have laid out a perfectly feasible design for providing a fully
  functional non-GAK compliant "Commercial Data Recovery" (CDR) system.
  I have not seen any PGPers anonymous or otherwise who have come up
  with any flaws in this design; nor even with any functionalities
  which it is not capable of meeting with similar degrees of weak tamper
  resistance to the GAK compliant CMR design.
Did you miss that argument?
I'll use the term "data recovery" to describe it to highlight the key
differences between PGP's method which is Commercial _Message_
Recovery, because the "message recovery" design philosophy is a
fallacy adopted by swallowing the GAKkers "key escrow" arguments.  The
argument that you somehow need to escrow transient communications keys
to allow governments access to information stored on disks.  That
people swallow this argument never ceases to amaze.
You will notice that there have been no technical refutations of my
CDR design.  I and others have I think been able to demonstrate that
it is just as flexible, and to boot more secure.
I agree with the rest of Attila's points.

@_author: Adam Back 
@_subject: proposal: commercial data recovery 
If we take the design goal of designing a commercial data recovery
system which is not GAK compliant, we can most succinctly state this
design goal as the task of ensuring that:
- at no point will any data transferred over communications links be
  accessible to anyone other than the sender and recipient with out
  also obtaining data on the recipient and/or senders disks
I think we can distill the design principles required to meet the
design goal of a non-GAK compliant Corporate Data Recovery (CDR) down
to ensuring that:
1. no keys used to secure communications in any part of the system are
   a-priori escrowed with third parties
2. second crypto recipients on encrypted communications are not
   used to allow access to third parties who are not messaging
   recipients manually selected by the sender
3. communications should be encrypted to the minimum number of
   recipients (typically one), and those keys should have as short a
   life time as is practically possible
Included in 2) is the principle of not re-transmitting over
communication channels keys or data re-encrypted to third parties
after receipt -- that is just structuring -- and violates design
principle 2.
With these three principles you still have lots of flexibility because
you can escrow storage keys, do secret splitting of storage keys, and
store keys encrypted to second storage accessors on the local disk for
stored data recovery purposes.
As an additional bonus, principle 3 adds extra security against
attackers gaining access to encrypted traffic after the fact -- the
recipient no longer has the key -- this is a form of forward secrecy.
Systems designed to the CDR design principles are of significantly
less use to GAKkers than PGP Inc's GAK compliant Commercial Message
Recovery (CMR) design.  The CDR design significantly hinders the take
up of GAK if widely deployed.  Design principle 3 -- forward secrecy -- is inherently hostile to
GAKkers, and is the strongest statement you can make against GAK: you
are purposelly _destroying_ communications keys at the earliest
possible moment to ensure that GAKkers can not obtain the keys by
legal and extra-legal coercion, black mail, and rubber hose
The whole system translates into the Feds having to come and
physically take your disk to obtain information about you, which is
much better than GACK, and not what the GAKkers are interested in at
this point.  The GAKkers would like to install themselves, and coerce
companies into installing for them (via GAKker/USG/NSA/NIST organised
efforts such as the 56 bit export permit for companies installing key
escrow; and efforts such as the Key Recovery Parners Alliance (KRAP)).
I fear that PGP Inc's CMR proposal inadvertently meets most of the
NIST/NSA specified KRAP requirements.
What the GACKers want is systems where they can perform routine key
word scanning and fishing expeditions into your communications from
the comfort of their offices, without your knowledge.  This is push
button Orwellian government snooping.
Within the constraints imposed by the CDR design principles, there is
plenty enough flexibility to acheive the commercial data recovery
functionality to similarly weak levels of enforcability as achieved by
the CMR design.  Weak levels of enforceability are appropriate because
there are other exceedingly easy bypass routes: super-encryption, and
walking out of the office with a DAT tape.
I would like to organise a collaborative effort to write a white paper
discussing how to implement various functionalities using the CDR
design principle.
Then I would like to see discussion of which set of these
functionalities which best acheive the user requirement for company
data recovery.
Lastly I would like to see a collaborative development effort to
provide a example implementation of a CDR system which can be used as
a discussion point for the OpenPGP standardisation process.
I suppose the best place to discuss this process is the IETF forum for
discussion of the OpenPGP standard, the OpenPGP mailing list
(subscribe by sending message body "subscribe ietf-open-pgp" to
"majordomo at imc.org").
I have already had people express in email to me their interest in
doing this.  Those people can speak up if they want to.  Technical
input is sought from people opposed to GAK compliant software, and
from PGP Inc, and others defending PGP's GAK compliant CMR proposal.

Thank you.  I would encourage others to read the proposal, and
provide criticisms of it.
I agree entirely.  The motivation for attempting to formalise the CDR
design principles, and for exploring designs which are non-GAK
compliant is based on these lines of reasoning, that we should:
1. Persuade PGP Inc that there are less GAK friendly ways of
   implementing data recovery
2. If that argument fails, and in the event that PGP were to try to
   influence the IETF OpenPGP forum to adopt any features relating to
   pgp5.5 GAK compliant functionality into the OpenPGP standard that we
   have an alternate proposal well enough thought through to compete
   with PGP's CMR proposal with sound technical arguments.
3. Of improving the state of the technology by working to include
   forward secrecy as much as possible into secure email messaging.
   This is a very effective method of giving the bird to the
   GAKkers, by purposefully destroying communications keys as soon as
   possible after the fact.  This is consistent with the CDR design
   goal: make the GAKkers job as difficult as possible.  Frustrating the
   GAKkers is a fun, morally satisfying activity.
The application you describe has very interesting implications for the
CDR vs CMR debate.
I think that one way that you could implement remote backup in a way
which is sympathetic to CDR design principles like this:
- The communications security aspect could be acheived via the normal
  design for securing communications derived from the CDR design
  principles.  That is using short lived communications keys with no
  third party access to communications in transit without access to
  hard disks at either end.
- The data would be super-encrypted to the companies backup recovery
  storage key(s).
This technically violates the CDR design goal and principles of not
allowing third party access to communicated data, super encryption
doesn't negate this, it is just more structuring.
However, super-encryption does minimise the damage by preserving CDR
principle that recovery of data should require physical compromise of
one or both end points, which I think is an important principle, and
a useful property in this case.
This lesson leads to the corollary to the CDR principles that:
- if you can't keep to the principle of not transmitting data with third
  party recovery information attached,
- super-encryption of the transmitted recoverable data can be
  used to at least preserve the requirement for one or both ends of
  the communication to be compromised to effect third party access.
But still, the remaining way that this system could be perverted would
be as you say for the GAKkers to demand to be one of the storage
accessors for the encrypted disk backup, and for the GAKkers to then
attempt to coerce the remote storage service provider to hand over the
ciphertext, or for the government to set themselves up as a central
provider of off site backup services.
The GAKkers desire for automatic access to communicated storage data
is frustrated to the maximal extent possible by those CDR design
principles we have managed to retain.  To achieve automated access the
GAKkers must start replacing software, and we have prevented automatic
snooping of our backup data whilst it is in communication, with
software we have fielded.
- CDR design principles do not prevent someone modifying software, but
  as we all know deployed systems are additional obstacles to overcome:
  they have to coerce some company in to implementing the new software
  with built in GAK, and they have to coerce everyone into replacing
  their existing software with this unpopular new software.
Widely deployed systems can be large obstacles.  The mess the US IRS
in with their millions of lines of hard to modify source attest to
this fact.
The IRS scenario has some lessons for us, for possible additional CDR
design principles:
- keep the source code out of reach of GAKkers so that they can not
  coerce us so easily to modify it.  Off shore backup might be useful;
  destroy the backup recovery key if GAK comes in.
- make systems non-interoperable where this does not interfere with
  functionality
- have mandatory GAK company contingency plans such as moving the
  company to Switzerland.
That first suggestion costs so much in the loss of user access to
source code to assure ourselves that there is no backdoor that we
probably can't employ it.  The other two look like sound principles to
One comfort which can be drawn from the above design using super
encryption inside a communications envelope protected with short lived
non-escrowed communication keys, is that the fielded software could
not be used as-is to prevent the practice of jurisdiction shopping.
Another comfort is that companies can, even if forbidden from using
offshore remote backup facilities, simply stop using remote backup
facilities at all, unless the GAKkers really go overboard and demand
that all citizen units will run this government remote backup software
to upload diffs of their disks to government run backup services.  I'm
sure they would love to do that, and charge you for the "service" too.
Also I expect there would be significant political hurdles for the
GAKkers to overcome in mandating government run remote backup services
for citizen units, or even for companies in our countries.

I agree with that statement entirely.
The principle has deeper meaning than your point.  It acknowledges
that there are limits to what can be done to enforce things in
software.  What it argues is that you should enforce what you can
where this helps you to make your software less useful to GAKkers
without modifications.  So if this means that the GAKkers can't use
your software with out getting you to re-write it, or without making
the modifications themselves this is good because fielded systems have
intertia.  It takes time and costs money to make software updates,
doubly so where people will be hostile to those updates.  People who
would otherwise not care about GAK will suddenly "care" because they
are too lazy to update their system, or becaues the update will cost
them money.
Btw. Lest it is not clear, when I say "should" in this discussion of
the anti-GAK protocol design process I mean "should" according to my
CDR or "anti-GAK" protocol design principles.  If following these
principles causes you to have non functioning or unsaleable designs,
and when this occurs you should still try to violate as few of the
design principles as possible.
So for your .procmail filter example: what the principle says is that
you should make it as non-automatable as possible in your software to
do this redirection in electronic form.  The danger about automated
redirection in electronic form is that there will be a nice little box
saying for you to type: "recovery at lazarus", where lazarus is the
address of the recovery machine on your LAN, but then the GAKkers can
pass laws and all the people who bought your software will be
automatically able to comply by filling in that box with
"thoughtpolice at nsa.gov"; alternately the GAKkers may buy your software
for re-sale in Iraq and then fill in the field with or
"thoughtpolice at mil.iq", with the result that Iraqis.
So for example with your .procmail example: the email client should
decrypt the traffic with short lived keys to provide forward secrecy,
and re-encrypt the plaintext for storage in your mail folder with a
recoverable key (presuming you want corporate data recovery of your
mail folder in case your dog chews your smart card key token).
Forwarding of email at the .procmail level won't help the GAKkers in
this case because the email is still encrypted; and the anti-GAK
protocol design principles state that the encrypted message should be
encrypted to one recipient only: you.
The anti-GAK design principles also mean that you should offer no
tools to decrypt from the command line.  This ensures that GAKkers
will be hindered from using software provided by you to cobble
together a GAK system, without writing and distributing software
Think of the CDR or anti-GAK software principles as attempting to
codify your natural predilections as a GAK hating protocol designer.
They codify how best to design your software to hinder GAKkers.
Clearly the GAKkers can pass a law saying that you must manually
forward each of your emails after decryption to them, but if the
software provides no easy way to automate this process they are asking
the impossible if there are 10 million US citizens using the software.
Contrast this to PGP Inc's CMR design where all that is required is a
change to one field for completely automated over the wire key word
I like your locality point.
It is something I had not earlier considered had more than binary
meaning (communicated or not ever communicated).  However it does.
The Frantz corollary to the anti-GAK protocol design principles is
i)  recovery information should be kept as close to the data as possible
ii) if recovery information is moved it should in preference not be
    transferred using over communications networks, and should
    not be transferred automatically by the software without requiring
    human interaction.
You can see that this design principle leads to some at first
apparently absurd requirements, but actually they are all sensible and
pertinent.  If the software requires user interaction to transmit
recovery information this means therefore that it should not be
possible with the software as is to write automatic scripts; this
contributes to the uselessness of the software to the GAKkers.
Of course there are ways around everything (eg. scripting software
which allows mouse and keyboard actions to be automated); but we are
trying to avoid easy cobbling together actions by the GAKkers allowing
them to convert our software designed under anti-GAK principles into
one which can then becomes automated GAK system.
Also clearly there is some user intelligence required in the design
process to work out functionalities it is worth forgoing where it
comes to this by comparing their potential value to the GAKker against
the ergonomic or utility advantage to the user.

Rick Smith I'm not sure whether pgp5.5 has this ability to screen messages prior
to reading, and also not sure whether it has the ability to snoop
messages prior to sending built in.
The basis is there for the functionality in the enforced second
recipient, but I'm not sure whether the client, or SNMP management
tools, or SMTP policy enforcer implement this functionality.
I'd welcome clarification from PGP Inc., employees, or anyone in the
US has tried the pgp5.5 software for business suite.
It does yes.  And that demonstrates that the principle is achieving
it's function in high-lighting areas of a design which could be used
for GAK purposes.
Absolutely.  You should try hard though to see if there are any
software hacks or protocol reorganisations you can do to make the
system unusable for GAK, or as close to unusable as you can.
Where that problem is can messages be screen by processes?  One
solution if you restrict yourself to processes is to move the function
to the client and scan after decrypt.  This isn't as easy to integrate
into existing MUAs but would be possible for fresh re-writes like
pgp5.x clients.
If you want ability for humans to scan messages manually as well, and
you can't live with the modifications in the client, you can do this
within the CDR design principles:
Have all email received by the company encrypted to the companies
public key.  Have your virus filter/human screener check the email,
and then pass on to user in clear, or pass on to user encrypted with
users key.
Actually this is more secure than your solution, because the client
already has an in memory master key; and now you have one crypto
recipient rather than two to blow your security for you by allowing
inadvertent key compromise.
For outgoing email, configure the mail client plugin to either send in
plain-text, or to sign only (one hopes with non escrowed signature
keys, else your MIL friends will be able to forge each others mail),
or to encrypt to the outgoing filtering agent, and have the outbound
mail hub filter, or forward to human screener content checking.
CDR compliant.  Has some extra resistance to GAK corruption.
As an additional application of CDR anti-GAK principles you could do
the small software hack of allowing the clients and/or mail filtering
agents to only communicate with each other if the machine IP addresses
look like they are on the same mail hub.
Don't provide source.  (I suspect your company doesn't anyway for this
kind of app, or do MIL people like to inspect source?)
So now your system has a number of extra protections against being
used for GAK.  They are not perfect, but you've done what you can, and
it's a definate improvement over what you had before.
However I'm not sure it matters for your application really whether it
is GAK compliant or not.  This is because your application sounds like
it is mainly for defense contractors, and MIL or NSA type use.  As far
as I'm concerned that lot deserve GAK.  Keep themselves honest :-)
You can acheive the same functionality by insisting on mail being
encrypted for the firewall.  Firewall can re-encrypt for intended
I think you have a point there and that it's not entirely clear how
this would work out.
I don't think that's the way it will work.  What they'll do is require
SEC cleared companies to provide this key as a matter of law to the
government.  If cheating is detected the bosses will get prison terms.
Then they'll slowly spread it from SEC cleared firms to other
companies.  Maybe Public companies.  Then they'll create a reichstag
fire FBI constructed publicity type cases; perhaps money laundering,
or purported mafia front business as an example of a public threat
from allowing companies to communicate without escrow.  Individuals
too, some terrorist cases, a few more large scale bombings.  No
If PGP provided facility for multiple enforced extra crypto
recipients, it would be even more GAK compliant, as companies could
just put a NSA key into the recipient box.
The CDR design principles also apply to standards.  Standards are very
powerful things.  If OpenPGP requires capability to understand and
encode to second crypto recipients which are not message recipients
for conformancy, we are in trouble also because all clients will then
be required to make GAK easier to enforce; the capability is right
there in pgp5.0 and pgp5.5 now.
If on the other hand the OpenPGP standard does not include the second
non message recipient crypto recipient feature, then companies who do
chose to do so must build up their own client base outside of the
installed client base, because they won't be able to build
GAK and have interoperability at the same time.
(We'll see whether or not PGP argue for this feature to go in the
standard in a bit, when the draft standard is released, and
discussions commence).
Also remember that another danger with GAK software is that your
country might be too liberal for the government to get away with
various things, but others aren't.
We don't want to encourage civil rights abuses.  In some countries
saying non-government approved thoughts results in prison terms,
torture, and painful death.
Well I hope you're right of course, but I feel PGP could do more to
prevent the scenario I present above, which I feel is fairly
I also hope I have provided some worked examples of the logic in
applying the CDR design principles.
(They are counter-intuitive sorts of principles to work with because
they are all negatives: don't do this, don't do that, no
recommendations as such on what _to do_.  This is because what you do
is explore the solution space outside of the restriction they apply on
it.  They are also strange in that it is unusual to see formally
codified cryptographic property design principles which reflect
entirely a political issue.  Must me a first :-)

@_subject: why Phil Zimmermann should be speaking out against pgp5.5 and CMR 
(Readers may notice PRZ's email address on the Cc line, this is an
open letter addressed to him).
In the debate on the controversial pgp5.5 commerical message recover
(CMR) system, I noticed someone made the comment that they couldn't
see what the big deal is with enforced multiple crypto recipients who
aren't also message recipients, as pgp2.x has had non-enforced
multiple crypto recipients for ages.
I will put the case for why this practice should be avoided for
security reasons.
I would like to also put the case of why the enforced multiple crypto
recipient construct should be avoided in building messaging systems
where the designers would like to avoid building GAK compliant
The security reasoning is simple: there are is an extra door into the
encrypted data: via the CMR key.  Introducing an extra door reduces
security, because there are now two keys which could be compromised to
gain access to the data.
That was simple.  Possibly not that major a problem, perhaps both keys
are so well secured that the additional leakage is academic.  In that
case, fair enough.
Now the GAK compliant case:
Firstly it is important to understand the subtle but very significant
difference between enforced crypto recipients who aren't message
recipients and normal pgp2.x style multiple crypto recipients.
This difference is as much to do with the way that mail clients and
plugins have used the pgp2.x multiple crypto recipients in fielded
systems as with the actual messaging packet differences.
A message recipient is someone who's email address is listed in a To:
A crypto recipient is someone who will be able to decrypt the message.
Pgp is a hybrid crypto system, a message consists of the email
encrypted with a randomly generated symmetric key, the session key.
The session key is in turn encrypted to the public key of the
recipient, these are called Public Key Encrypted (PKE) packets.  To
implement multiple crypto recipients pgp simply tacks on as many PKE
packets as there are crypto recipients; each PKE packet being the
session key encrypted to the public key of one of the crypto
Now in most fielded PGP email plugins, and clients which take notice
of Cc: and Bcc: fields, the number of crypto recipients ties directly
with the number of message recipients.
This makes it difficult therefore for the existing systems to automate
encryption to a third party without software modifications.  If a
company which is hoping to become a market leader (a hint PGP) were to
retain this functionality, GAKkers would find it difficult to use this
software to effectively impose GAK.
Sure you can Cc: your message to the NSA key.  This would be voluntary
GAK.  Carl Ellison and a number of others suggested this whimsically
years back.  As in "What's all the fuss about voluntary key escrow,
I'll implement voluntary key escrow for you right now, get DIRNSA to
generate a key, and I'll sign it, and put it on the keyservers -- end
of problem".  Carl Ellison had a very good point.  The government
doesn't want voluntary key escrow, they want as some suspected all
along mandatory key escrow, they want GAK (the GAK term is
coincidentally another Carl Ellison meme).
The reason this is voluntary GAK is that the user in most mail systems
would have to go to some concious effort to do this, and may forget
some of the time.  (It's difficult to make "forgetting" a 5 year
jailable offense).
Now I'm well aware that some email clients, and MTAs will no doubt
allow you to forward copies of all your email transparently to another
party.  (Please don't flood us with replies describing such
functionality).  But this is not really the point; it doesn't matter
if you can forward copies of your encrypted email
"thoughtpolice at nsa.gov" -- they can't decrypt it with out the
recipients key.
Now we come to the danger of PGP Inc's CMR mechanism.
CMR breaks this traditional premise that the crypto recipients
correspond one-to-one with the message recipients.
What it allows is instructions to be given in a public key that tell
the software to encrypt messages intended for the owner of this key to
two message recipients.
This means that for example:
If Phil Zimmermann is using his own companies pgp5.0 mail client (and
I presume he is), that if the US Government were to pass a law
requiring everyone to generate new CMR keys that he would be able to
comply without changing his software.  This is why I would argue that
even pgp5.0 is GAK compliant, it knows how to understand CMR public
(I am not actually sure if the pgp5.0 mail client can generate CMR
public keys, but the pgp5.5 one can for sure, I'd welcome
clarification on this point).
The new mandatory GAK law would mean that if he didn't generate a CMR
key he would go to jail.  So he complies.  The terms of the law
dictate that the CMR recipeint in individual's mail clients must be
"thoughtpolice at nsa.gov".
Now the next time one of PRZ's favourite resistance groups that he
likes to tell us stories about send him an email thanking him for the
useful piece of software he provided them with, the USG can listen in
because the pgp5.0 software which the resistance fighters have
presumably also upgraded to will understand PRZ's CMR key.  The USG
will if it suits their purposes sell this information to the
government in the originating country, and they will have the death
squads go kill the resistance fighters if they can determine their
identities from the leaked message.
This kind of makes a mockery of what PRZ and the PGP brand stands for.
Now the pgp 5.5 defenders at PGP Inc will jump up at this point and
tell us that this is not so because pgp 5.0 has ability to strip out
the second enforced recipient.  Well it does.  However, PGP Inc has
come up with another related clever innovation: their SMTP policy
This ensures that when resistance fighters attempt to send PRZ email
inside the PGP Inc offices (where they will be presumably field
testing their GAKware software suite), that if they do take off the
CMR recipient, that their mail will bounce.
So not being technical crypto gurus, they will try not taking it off
next time and the NSA will read the mail again, resulting in the
resitance fighters death.
Or perhaps alternatively if they really did want to send him email for
an important reason, like perhaps to warn him that the corrupt
government they were fighting against was going to introduce a law of
mandating the use of pgp5.5 by all ISPs and individuals, they would
have no way to reach him.  This would suit PRZ quite well, because he
probably wouldn't want to hear that.
Actually it is possibly not fair to pick on PRZ, as I consider it
somewhat likely than PRZ is dragging his feet internally to PGP, but
is powerless to stop the corporate mindset now at the helm.  And if so
I apologise for making points at his expense.  But also it is
important that if PRZ is against this move, that he speak up.  That
act would have major significance in altering PGP Incs mind.
It might also result in a parting of the ways, but I understand from
attenders at a physical cypherpunks meeting in the US that PRZ when
quizzed about PGP Inc corporate mentality meaning the company would
eventually sell out to GAK, relayed that he would quit rather than
have be associated with this.

It is GAK pervertable, but it is much more resistant to GAK perversion
than PGP Inc's CMR system.  I think Tim can reason pretty well without
cribbing from the anti-GAK principles, but that he could present
marginally more GAK-hostile systems by using the anti-GAK principles.
(Or perhaps he would figure them out anyway but figures them to be too
complex... my only real claim is that by working to these principles
that it helps clarfiy what you are trying to defend against, and
trying to avoid in your systems).
The reason that you are right that what Tim suggests is GAK
pervertable is that it partly violates one of the anti-GAK design
principles I have been trying to hone.
It violates the principle that recovery information should not be
communicated (via sneaker net on a floppy to the company safe).
It does however obey the corollary that: if you figure you must move
recovery data, you should at least make it inconvenient, avoid
electronic communicated recovery data, and generally require the
recovery data to be as localised as possible.  (Also the principles
state that you should use forward secret comms keys, but I think that
might be pushing it for sneaker net between machines and a laptop in
the safe for ergonomics reasons :-)
Here is how use of the anti-GAK design principles can help to provide
a more GAK hostile system:
It is better to use recovery rather than escrow.  (Encryption of
Alice's private key with a companies recovery key).  This allows you
then to store the recovery information more locally to the data,
closest possible locality to data being another anti-GAK design
Now how is this harder than GAK?  Heh well you need to use your
imagination and try to make a system designed to fuck with the GAKkers
minds at this point.  Remember not only do you design the system to
not communicate the key automatically, you try your best to prevent it
being removed from the system.
Here's a few ideas:
You store the recovery info on the users disk only, but you do your
damnest to obfuscate it.  Encrypt it with keys hidden in the
executable, obfuscate the code to hell and back, and don't provide
source for that module.  (Obfuscation tricks like interpreter of
encrypted instruction streams ought to take a little bit of
You also hide the recovery data inside the keyrings, and obfuscate
them to hell and back around the file system in slack space etc.  This
is to make it harder to copy to a floppy.
So now the GAKkers can still get your recovery info, because they
could theoretically unwind that problem.  But it is sure a lot harder
than requiring every one to email them a copy of the key they just put
on a disk.  The software doesn't give you any help obtaining your key
in a mailable form, or in a form to stick on a floppy either.  In fact
it does it's damnest to prevent it.
This is the kind of monkey-wrenching PGP should be investigating,
rather than investing time in designing `elegant' GAK implementations.
Combine with forward secrecy with as quick update time as you can
manage without interfering with ergonomics issues, and the GAKkers
have got to come back every 5 minutes, and grab a copy of your entire
disk, or reverse engineer the obfuscation, to grab the next obfuscated
Wow, Lucky! I usually consider you to be spot on most such things, but
I think you failed to hit the bulls-eye there; in fact I think you
missed the dartboard entirely!
I thought it was you who was pointing out earlier the fallacy induced
by the key escrow meme (escrowing transient communicatoins keys with
governments or companies to recover data stored on frigging disks!)
(Actually you applied it just to goverments but the argument extends
to companies perfectly).
The only way that it's elegant is that it is an elegant fully ready to
roll GAK implementation.
(Notice Bruce Schneier's forward of a case of a GAKker already
starting to crow about the demonstration of GAKware feasibility in
There are plenty of less GAK compliant things you can do than what
they are doing.  The anti-GAK design principles help to clarify
thought in designing a full spectrum from mildly GAK resistant through
to rabidly GAK-hostile.  I would hope that PGP (and you lot at C2Net)
will crank the setting up to mad dog rabid anti GAK mode with nested
obfuscated interpreters interpreting each other interpreting
instruction sequences to recover keys.  And busting your butts to make
your systems ergonomic and slick to the extent that the competitors
GAKware products look like dried up turds in comparison.  Deployment
being probably the most important anti-GAK principle of all!

They're right too that it is possible (though less secure).
That's the purpose of the anti-GAK design principles, see [1] below.
They codify a design process for how to fuck with:
- protocol designs
- standardisation processes
- implementations
to make them as GAK-hostile as possible.
There is a scale From: pro-GAK: (USG, NSA, TIS, IBM (give me video cams in all bedrooms))
GAK neutral: (implementer who just implements ignoring political argument of
  whether or not GAK will come in believing it irrelevant)
GAK-hostile: (implementer who is rabidly anti-GAK, and wants to stop
  the GAKkers at all costs; he wants to manipulate protocol standards
  settings processes to ensure what results is not just `not GAK' if
  implemented in one way, he wants to make sure that it is impossible to
  be both conformant to the standard and implement GAK, then he wants to
  implement to that anti-GAK-infiltrated standard and deploy as many
  of his units as possible all implemented as GAK-hostily as possible,
  with user ergonomics, functionality and presentation m$ would die for).
I really truthfully am completely puzzled as to PGP.  They make nice
pro-privacy rants (eg Jon Callas), but yet they are implementing a GAK
compliant system, and one which can also be used to itself fullfill
full GAK requirements without any software modifications.  It could
literally be plugged in tommorrow.  This is inconsistent.
Then myself, Tim May, Peter Trei, Bruce Schneier, Peter Gutmann, and
most of the rest of cpunks, and OpenPGP, go over and over what is
wrong with it, how to do it in non-GAK pervertable ways, or not to do
it at all.
And pgp _doesn't get it_.
I am non-plussed.
Are we suffering group hallucination here and are we all totally
confused?  Or is something very strange going on insde pgp's building?
What _is_ going on in there?  Are they arguing?  Are they blissfully
ignorant that the GAKkers are applauding their efforts?  Has the
corporate mind set take over?  Have they done a deal with the Feds?
Have they got $ signs in front of their eyes and forgotten that they
were once pro-privacy (those that ever were; I guess some of the are
just various suits).
I thought they were supposed to be on our side?
`fail-safe'?  As in blowing holes in cardboard cutouts with `fed'
written across them at 50 yds with a large bore weapon full of
hollow-points?  Sounds phun :-)
Another form of backup plan is to get the fuck out when GAK hits.  Go
move to switzerland, or anguilla or somewhere from which to continue
your after the fact monkey wrenching.  (Is switzerland any good?  Only
place other than UK I have citizenship -- actually not true have US
two through wife dual nationality, but I'm not sure about US right
now -- may get to GAK before UK lot do).
(pls excuse if `fail-safe' means something entirely unrelated, I'm not
familiar with the euphamism/technical term).
If we take the design goal of designing a commercial data recovery
system which is not GAK compliant, we can most succinctly state this
design goal as the task of ensuring that:
- at no point will any data transferred over communications links be
  accessible to anyone other than the sender and recipient with out
  also obtaining data on the recipient and/or senders disks
I think we can distill the design principles required to meet the
design goal of a non-GAK compliant Corporate Data Recovery (CDR)
system down to ensuring that:
1. no keys used to secure communications in any part of the system are
   a-priori escrowed with third parties
2. second crypto recipients on encrypted communications are not
   used to allow access to third parties who are not messaging
   recipients manually selected by the sender
3. communications should be encrypted to the minimum number of
   recipients (typically one), and those keys should have as short a
   life time as is practically possible
Included in 2) is the principle of not re-transmitting over
communication channels keys or data re-encrypted to third parties
after receipt -- that is just structuring -- and violates design
principle 2.
With these three principles you still have lots of flexibility because
you can escrow storage keys, do secret splitting of storage keys, and
store keys encrypted to second storage accessors on the local disk for
stored data recovery purposes.
As an additional bonus, principle 3 adds extra security against
attackers gaining access to encrypted traffic after the fact -- the
recipient no longer has the key -- this is a form of forward secrecy.
Systems designed to the CDR design principles are of significantly
less use to GAKkers than PGP Inc's GAK compliant Commercial Message
Recovery (CMR) design.  The CDR design significantly hinders the take
up of GAK if widely deployed.  Design principle 3 -- forward secrecy -- is inherently hostile to
GAKkers, and is the strongest statement you can make against GAK: you
are purposelly _destroying_ communications keys at the earliest
possible moment to ensure that GAKkers can not obtain the keys by
legal and extra-legal coercion, black mail, and rubber hose
The whole system translates into the Feds having to come and
physically take your disk to obtain information about you, which is
much better than GACK, and not what the GAKkers are interested in at
this point.  The GAKkers would like to install themselves, and coerce
companies into installing for them (via GAKker/USG/NSA/NIST organised
efforts such as the 56 bit export permit for companies installing key
escrow; and efforts such as the Key Recovery Parners Alliance (KRAP)).
I fear that PGP Inc's CMR proposal inadvertently meets most of the
NIST/NSA specified KRAP requirements.
What the GACKers want is systems where they can perform routine key
word scanning and fishing expeditions into your communications from
the comfort of their offices, without your knowledge.  This is push
button Orwellian government snooping.
Within the constraints imposed by the CDR design principles, there is
plenty enough flexibility to acheive the commercial data recovery
functionality to similarly weak levels of enforcability as achieved by
the CMR design.  Weak levels of enforceability are appropriate because
there are other exceedingly easy bypass routes: super-encryption, and
walking out of the office with a DAT tape.
I would like to organise a collaborative effort to write a white paper
discussing how to implement various functionalities using the CDR
design principle.
Then I would like to see discussion of which set of these
functionalities which best acheive the user requirement for company
data recovery.
Lastly I would like to see a collaborative development effort to
provide a example implementation of a CDR system which can be used as
a discussion point for the OpenPGP standardisation process.
I suppose the best place to discuss this process is the IETF forum for
discussion of the OpenPGP standard, the OpenPGP mailing list
(subscribe by sending message body "subscribe ietf-open-pgp" to
"majordomo at imc.org").
I have already had people express in email to me their interest in
doing this.  Those people can speak up if they want to.  Technical
input is sought from people opposed to GAK compliant software, and
from PGP Inc, and others defending PGP's GAK compliant CMR proposal.

Tim covered that pretty well.  Inconvience is significant.  If we can
redesign the protocols or backup procedure so that the GAKker must
modify software before GAK is even possible we have largely won.  If
we can accomplish subversion of the OpenPGP standard we may be on to a
winner too...  if PGP can't implement their beloved GAK functionality
without being a non-conforming application.
All it takes is for the standard not to accept the pgp5.5 CMR key
extension.  It really is too new and experimental to include says all.
Let's include it as a may says Callas.  No thanks says all, we don't
want any of it; too new too experimental.
If it comes to it, and I figured I could get away with it from a sales
perspective I would toss out encrypted email data recovery altogether
in preference to implementing GAK for the GAKkers.
Implementing GAK for GAKkers has similar immorality to blowing away
freedom fighters in foreign countries for sport -- it results in dead
freedom fighters, and dead thought criminals (say boo to some
governments, and they'll have your head on a platter within hours).
The effect is not quite as direct, but it is surely the effect.
Even for selfish reasons we don't want GAK for ourselves, and this
eventuality is far from impossible in our respective countries.
Sure they could.  Just simply switching from CMR to CDR:
Store encryption key encrypted to a company recovery key on their
disk.  Or on a floppy in the safe even.
No enforced second recipient necessary.  Recovery of archived messages
Enforced second recipients are worse than straight forward escrow.
This kind of thing is better for the reasons Tim listed in his defense
of storing the keys in the safe on a floppy as opposed to second
How about forward secrecy?  You could make it even less GAK friendly
if the keys only lasted for seconds.  Then what are you going to do?
Send a constant stream of keys to NSA HQ?  What if the software tried
it's hardest to not allow recovery or access to it's keys (it's hardly
likely to given the desire for forward secrecy).  So how can that be
perverted for GAK?
Does PGP investigate these?  Hell no!  They whinge: ergonomics, too
complicated, not possible, you are having a group halucination, you
don't understand software design.

CMR keys are the root of all evil in pgp5.5.  Without them almost any
permutation of recovery care to construct would be less useful to the
GAKkers, for all the organisational, and inconvenience reasons Tim
describes.  Governments have problems handling complexity.  So make their job complex.  If you were one of the people writing the
IRS tax software back in the 60s, and you were in deep cover, a
proto-cypherpunk, and were bright enough to see the future
possibilites you would have done all you could to fuck up the IRS
system.  You would have obfuscated the code.  You would have put logic
bombs in it.  You would have destroyed the source code
surreptisiously.  (Destroying source code has analogies to destroying
keys at earliest opportunity, you are destroying something which your
enemy needs).
Any bets as to if any of this actually happened on purpose?  I reckon

The 3 main GAK-hostile design principles are also independently good
security principles in protecting communications traffic.  There are
ways to acheive data recovery functionality without CMR.  I think I
have demonstrated amply what these methods are, and have given a
design methodology for designing such systems.  PGPers are just not
interested to hear.
have put into their CMR based enforcement policy functionality, I
predict they won't remove CMR whatever we, or Schneier, or anyone else
says or proves about more secure less GAK-friendly ways of
implementing corporate data recovery.  I also suspect they won't
listen to Tim's earlier argument that they do nothing about recovery
of messages rather than implement GAK.
This quote should give us clue as to why they will continue with CMR: So they are not willing to follow through the anti-GAK design process
where this could hinder bottom lines.
Similar arguments would presumably present them with "no choice" but
to fulfill the order for 100,000 GAK compliant units from the
government terrorizing the freedom fighters PRZ likes to tell us
about who are already using PGP GAK compliant software: pgp5.0.
I think Tim's points are very valid.  CMR functionality if put into
the OpenPGP standard _will_ be used by PGP competitors to implement
message screening and snooping by company security guards etc.  It
will I am almost positive in due course be used to field such software
in countries with poor civil rights records.
Maybe PGP is not fielding systems they are "advising" their clients to
use for GAK, or for message screening, but this is what is going to
happen.  Their good advice isn't as much comfort as an OpenPGP
standard which is as hostile to this practice as possible, and a pgp
data recovery implementation which is also hostile to this.
PGP do not want to hear this.  It will cost development time.
The many people who have expressed to me off list that PGP has sold
out, are I think correct.
I think that except for carefully worded statements by PGP Inc
employees all those who have spoken on the topic in the OpenPGP forum
have agreed.  The CMR field should not go in OpenPGP.  This means that
the PGP SMTP policy enforcer will not meet the OpenPGP standard: it
will bounce mail from compliant implementations which ignore the CMR
I think this means that the person who suggested this:
to me in email made a good prediction.
What can we do about this situation?  Well we could build systems
which hack around the CMR system.  Easy enough: just put dud
"recovery" info inside.  We still have deployment problems.

@_subject: Equal rights for receivers 
It's a threat to the free world if the RECEIVER is allowed to request
the same thing when PGP Inc also goes ahead and implements an enforcer
to bounce mail failing to meet this `request'.  This is not a
`request', this is an `insistance'.  This is a ready to roll system
which could be used as-is to implement GAK.
It is also potentially dangerous even without the SMTP policy enforcer
because if this functionality (CMR public key extension) is part of
the OpenPGP standard, then conformant OpenPGP implementations are pre
GAK enabled -- when GAK comes in, they know how to send to CMR keys,
and the enforcement can be added later.
Notice also that using comparisons with pgp2.x multiple recipient
functionality to deflect criticism is a complete red herring: pgp2.x
multiple recipients do not request copies mail to keys to be sent to
other keys.
All crypto recipients correspond 1-1 to message recipients, and in
most cases there is only one message recipient (and therefore only 1
crypto recipient).  This is better security, and it can't be used for
GAK anywhere near as easily as CMR.
And yes turning encrypt-to-self on violates 1-1 correspondence with
message recipients, but encrypt-to-self is also a security flaw to use
this feature.  I rant about the security risk of encrypt-to-self
periodically, as a search of the archives would show.

Part of the problem in this debate I think is that I have proposed
many alternate designs, with varying degrees of GAK-hostility.
Also I have been accused of using "lots of anti GAK rhetoric, but
giving no proposals" by Kent.  I reject that claim.  (I did use lots
of rhetoric, but this was to try to impress upon those arguing for CMR
of it's dangers.  They do not seem to acknowledge them.) I'll try in
this post to steer clear of anti-GAK rhetoric.  We'll instead take it
as a given that pgp5.5 and pgp5.0 are GAK compliant because of CMR and
that this is a bad thing.
Will is correct on one point: at the begining I had not properly
thought one aspect through: my earlier decrypt & re-encrypt construct
violates anti-GAK design principle 2; namely it is guilty of the same
violation as CMR, it has an effective second crypto recipient outside
of the senders control. I agree with Will Price's comments on the GAK
pervertability tendencies of this construct.  I spotted the error of
my ways since clarifying my thoughts on the subject by constructing
the more formalised anti-GAK design principles.  Readers will see my
codification of my recognition of the dangers of the re-encrypting
construct in corollary 1 of the anti-GAK design principles (copy of
principles below [1]).  The fact that I posted this corollary in
updated copies of the design principles prior to Will's post should
show that this claim is sincere and not an attempt at side stepping
Will's observation: he is correct, I agree.
The rest of Will's post seems to miss the point, so it seems to me
that the best way to transfer understanding of how to use the anti-GAK
design principles to design less GAK friendly systems is to present a
worked example.
This first simple CDR replacement for PGP's CMR method also attempts
to keep changes necessary to implementations and packet formats to a
minimum.  Please understand also that it violates one of the major
design principles in order to acheive this simplicity and so that
objections that it is not that much more valuable than CMR will be
countered by showing you how to achieve an even more GAK-hostile
design by removing the violation of design principle 3, albeit with
more coding effort and design modifications on PGP's part.  Never the
less it is already much harder to pervert for GAK than CMR.
Design 1.
- scrap the CMR key extension
- store a copy of the private half of the users PGP encryption key
  encrypted to the company data recovery key on the users disk.
- (optional) design the software to make it hard to copy the data
  recovery packet from the disk, hide the data, bury it in keyrings,
  stego encode it, whatever, use your imagination.  This is to attempt
  to restrict the third parties ability to by pass the principle of
  non communication of recovery information
Recovery method:
Custodian of recovery key inserts recovery floppy disk in machine,
decrypts copy of users private key, hands control back to user to
choose new passphrase.
Possible objections:
objection  what if disk burns?
counter    backup your disk
objection  users don't back up disks
counter    that is a good way to loose data :-) if they don't have
              the data the key protecting the data won't help them
GAK-hostility rating:
Harder to pervert for GAK than pgp5.5 / pgp5.0 CMR design.
I'd be interested to see Will, or Hal, or other PGPer's criticisms of this
simple modification, perhaps criticisms could most constructively answer:
- what is stopping you implementing this
- are there any plug ins which can't cope with this
- are there user requirements which it can't meet
- is there some fundamental flaw you think I have missed
- can you see ways that this could be perverted to implement GAK
  (yes I can too, btw, but...)
- are those ways logisitically harder for GAKkers to acheive than for CMR
Please be specific, no general waffle about understanding the
complexities of balancing user ergonomics, user requirements etc.
That is a no-brainer, you need to do this analysis, the cost function
for evaluating such design issus is now expressed explicitly in design
principle 4 rather than being assumed.  List problems and explain the
significance of the all important deployability criteria.
Cryptographic protocol designs are very flexible; most design goals can
be met, or worked around I claim within the positive GAK-hostility
side of the cryptographic protocol and product design solution space.
Lastly, I would encourage readers to be critical of the GAK-hostile design
principles themselves:
- can you see any aspects which inaccurately reflect trade-offs
- can you see methods to bypass inadvertently or deliberately the design   that might require another corollary to correct.
In anticipation of constructive criticism,
GAK-hostile design principles
If we take the design goal of designing systems including
confidentiality which are not GAK compliant, we can most succinctly
state this design goal as the task of ensuring that:
- at no point will any data transferred over communications links be
  accessible to anyone other than the sender and recipient with out
  also obtaining data on the recipient and/or senders disks
We can then derive the design principles required to meet the design
goal of a non-GAK compliant system with confidentiality services down
to ensuring that:
principle 1:
   no keys used to secure communications in any part of the system are
   a-priori escrowed with third parties
principle 2:
   second crypto recipients on encrypted communications are not
   used to allow access to third parties who are not messaging
   recipients manually selected by the sender
principle 3:
   communications should be encrypted to the minimum number of
   recipients (typically one), and those keys should have as short a
   life time as is practically possible
principle 4:
   deployment wins.  violating any of principles 1 to 3 whilst
   still retaining some GAK-hostility can be justified where
   deployment is thereby increased to the extent that the violations
   increase the degree of GAK hostility in the target jurisdictions
   overall
Corrollary 1: Included in design principle 2) is the principle of not
re-transmitting keys or data after decryption over communication
channels, re-encrypted to third parties -- that is just structuring --
and violates design principle 2.
Corrollary 2: where communications are transmitted which violate
principles 1, 2 or 3 it is in general more GAK hostile to enforce as
far as possible that the recovery or escrow information remains in as
close proximity to the data as possible.
Corrollary 3: where communications are transmitted which violate
principles 1, 2 or 3 it is in general more GAK hostile to make these
communications as difficult to automate as possible.  For example no
scripting support is given to enforce that GUI user interaction is
required, and/or that the process is made artificially time consuming,
and/or that the communication must not use electronic communication

@_subject: fallacy alert! 
I have noticed serveral PGPers use this fallacy also.
It is a fundamental irrelevance.  If PGP Inc has selected this
principle as a guiding principle then they're nuts.
It matters not one whit what `statement of intent' you mark PGP CMR
extended public keys with.  That statement is semantically meaningless
as a design principle because it is utterly unenforceable.
Here are two examples to show how your expectation can be broken:
- the user decrypts your message encrypted to a `company access' key,
  and then proceeds to post it to cypherpunks
- you send a message encrypted to a `company access' key, but the
  company screwed up and lost the private half of the company access
  key
In neither case is the statement of intent honoured.  There are lots
of other ways to not honour such statements of intent, such as perhaps
forwarding a copy to your own supervisor at your company, or printing
out on paper and giving to secretary to file for future reference.
re-encryption and forwarding tends to be GAK pervertable, it violates
design principle 2 as explained in corollary 1 of the anti-GAK
principles.  Do not do this.  (I didn't realise the full danger of
this construct until recently, and is one result which fell out of the
exercise of developing a codified set of design rules to guide
protocol designers away from building GAK-compliant or GAKker-useful
"Key escrow" is too perverted a term to know even what you are
referring to.
If you mean data recovery (my CDR proposal) it is _exactly_ as visible
as CMR.  You can affix all the statements of intent you like to it.
(For all the good it will do you.)
There can be no enforcement of statement of intents.  All you can do
is hope that companies are not lying; encourage them to behave in ways
which you consider ethical.

GAK-hostility than example  which you are objected to above.
However, in the mean time, I would like you and other PGPers to

You appear to claim that your answer to the second question is no.
I would like to see you explain your reasoning for why this is so.
You may find it constructive to re-read some of Tim May's recent posts
as he explains the logic of this fairly clearly.  Tim May does not
need the anti-GAK design principles to think in an critical
GAK-hostile way.
PGP Inc does appear to need them because their design principles are
currently at best GAK-neutral, and appear to be largely based on
wooly, ill thought-out pro-privacy / liberal thinking.
You have to think in a crypto-anarchist, saboteur mindset to maximise
your ability to prevent mandatory GAK becoming reality.  The anti-GAK
design principles are a codification of the crypto-anarchist GAK
saboteur's natural predilections to want to prevent the GAKkers.
I have in waiting some other design principles which codify more
general crypto-anarchist design principles.  I will not be adding
these to the anti-GAK design principles at this stage for fear of

@_subject: re. GAK resistant design principles: worked example #1 
Kent Crispin has a tenacious ability to continue to think logically
and critically, and not be drawn into emotional exchanges in the face
of jibes and hostilities (I am referring to previous unpleasantaries
on cypherpunks).  I think we all could take a leaf out of his book.  I
am going to attempt to myself from this point on in the CMR vs CDR
argument.  (I accept Jon Callas comments along similar lines.)
I have resolved to repent my ways with regard to unconstructive
ranting and rudeness.  This should have the positive side effect of
reducing the length of my posts, and ensuring that more people read
them critically.
That the ideas seemed initially fuzzy is a reflection of the fact that
I have, as I presume others have also, been gradually improving my
understanding of these complex issues.
I found the exercise in attempting to codify what I consider to be
optimal design decisions from the point of view of maximising the GAK
resistance properties of protocol designs, software implementations
and communications standards useful in clarifying my thoughts.
I feel confident in my ability to demonstrate that my GR (GAK
resistant) design principles can be usefully applied to increase the
GAK resistance of the design of systems using confidentiality and
I will comment on your specific comments on this aspect below.
Your suggestion that the re-encryption construct is weak from a GAK
resistancy (GR) perspective is correct.  See my earlier comments on
realising the danger of that construct.
I am forced to agree that emotional attacks are likely to hinder
cooperation.  Therefore emotional attacks on this topic are themselves
likely to be counter to global GR optimisation.  It is for this reason
that I will attempt from this point on in this discussion to swallow
my anger unless I can justify outbursts in terms of GR optimisation.
Readers are encouraged to remind me if I start slipping.
I can only offer as an excuse that it seems to me that PGP Inc could
be doing more to increase the GAK resistance of their product and
design within the financial and user requirement constraints they
face.  Emotional appeals are as you say is not likely to be the best
means to explain this belief.
I also offer as a mild excuse that in carrying out interactive list
discussions with people in the US who are on GMT-8 that my sleep
deprivation may have been showing through in irritability :-) I found
myself for instance going to bed at 8.30 am the other night.
Allow me to rephrase that in the light of my GR maximisation motivated
apparent character reform:
I believe that PGP Inc could make their design more resistant to GAK. The reason I believe that PGP Inc has thus far arrived at different
design conclusions than I, Bruce Schneier, Tim May, Ian Brown, and
others, is that PGP Inc have differently prioritised the multiple
desirable properties of a socially progressive crypto design.
Desirable properties are in prioritsed order of importance as I see
1. preventing big brotherish governments enforcing GAK
2. discouraging little brotherish business practices
3. encouraging transparency of intent (marking keys with statements of
   intent on handling of plaintext)
4. application ergonomics
I think that PGP Inc has transposed criteria 1 and 2 in their
prioritisation.  I believe PGP Inc's design decisions and
recommendations to companies reflect honest attempts to discourage
little brother, and their use of statement of intent technology
demonstrates their commitment to preventing big brother.  But I fear
that their prioritisation reduces the big brother resistance of their
CMR system because this resistance has been traded off to attempt to provide little brother resistance.
If I understand correctly several PGP employees have claimed that you
should attempt to enforce the statement of intent principle with
protocol modifications.  Whilst statement of intent is useful, and a
good innovation which I applaud, criteria 1 and 2 should take
precedence where protocol modifications which are thought to
strengthen statement of intent have a side effect of reducing GAK
Independently I think that it is not semantically useful to try to
enforce statement of intent at the protocol level with the CMR method.
This is because having an enforced second recipient in no way
guarantees that the second recipient will read the message, or is able
to read the message (the second recipient might not receive the
ciphertext, or he might have lost the company access key).
I believe that using the GAK resistant design principles allows one to
focus more clearly on the benefits of the various trade-offs possible
and to more acurately prioritise the multiple social criteria.
Sounds like a good example to base discussions upon: X-terminals,
multi user unix work stations and remotely configurable PCs.
I would take your point there to be that you can't store the recovery
key on the local disk for the reason that the disk isn't local, and
that when the recovery key is stored on the local disk on remotely
administered or multi-user workstations that this is less secure.
I agree.  It is less secure.
(I have htmlized, and attempted to more clearly re-word the GR design
I have also added a fourth corollary which you might like to comment
on (it's not relevant to the above point).)
To return to your criticisms based on the mish-mash of shared user and
X-terminals typical of corporate environments, corollary 2 expresses
the best that can be done in this scenario:
So if you are using an X-terminal, your passphrase will be going over
the ethernet, and all the files will be on a unix box.  About all you
can do about this to minimise security problems is to try to secure
your ethernet with IPSEC technology.  This is not currently very
widely deployed especially for intranet use.
Certainly if you are using your X-terminal to connect to machines over
the internet many companies have taken steps to reduce the dangers of
this.  VPN systems, and SSH achieve this kind of thing.  IPSEC and VPN
technology are typically fairly GAK resistant anyway, because use of
forward secrecy is common.
The overall system is _still_ more GAK resistant than CMR for the
sorts of logistical reasons that Tim May has been describing.  You may
like to comment on this claim which I am willing to defend.
You can hack around it, and this is implicitly acknowledged.  The
point is that in trying to design the system so that it must be hacked
around before allowing easy use in a mandatory GAK setting you have
built in extra GAK resistance in the form of the deployment and
logistical problems the government will have in developing, and
deploying patches and making sure every one applies them.
It was stated in it's simplest possible form for clarity.
It is however possible to build resistance into the system in the form
of inertia of the deployed code base in not providing automated ways
to access the recovery information outside of the software package.
Bill Stewart came up with the very good suggestion for example that
you only keep some of the bits of the recovery key to ensure that
recovery appears is artificially made time consuming.  This means that
with out replacing your software base, the government has a much
harder time installing GAK.  This also has the social benefit of
discouraging companies from using what are intended to be data
recovery features as snooping features.  This is exactly the sort of
lateral thinking that I am hoping to encourage.
I fully agree that you have to acknowledge user ergonomics and user
requirements.  What I was asking was that people in criticising my GR
design principles explain which user requirements they think can not
be met, or which user ergonomics features are hindered.  I also
explicitly state in design principle 4 that you should balance these
considerations to maximise the global GAK resistance of the deployed
software and hardware in the target jurisdiction.
Perhaps if I give some examples of how some one designing a protocol
according to these principles might proceed in this direction it would
be clearer how to minimise the impact on ergonomics without losing
security to the extent that it allows government access simply as a
property of the induced weakness.  (In otherwords I am willing to
trade security for extra GAK resistance if it comes to it, but
typically does not seem to be required as GR design principles 1, 2,
and 3 are independently sound security objectives).
Companies would protect all keys by password, or by smart card token,
or by secured facilities or just by the nature of it being sufficient
for their security requirements to rely on the same weak physical
security which protects their paper files.
So: the signature key does not have recovery information -- I think
this is agreed by all.  The storage key used in encrypting information
on your disk is has recovery information stored as described.  The
shorter lived forward secret keys could be also recovery protected
(during their lifetime).  PGP 5.x already has this feature.  Consider
the encryption keys to be your forward secret keys.  Give them shorter
than normal expiry dates.
Your next comment is very pertinent in demonstrating the sorts of
problems you must work around in attempting to maximise use of forward
I have 2 comments on this problem:
Consider: a system which automatically adapts and is forward secret
when it is able but not when it is not possible is more GAK resistant
than one which never uses forward secrecy at all because of the
existance of some situations where it is difficult to use.
Consider also: a system which is relatively forward secret (perhaps
with key updates every week, or month) is more GAK resistant than one
which makes no frequent key recommendations and leaving people to
choose long expiries of 1 year or with user no comments made on the
dangers of not having expiries at all is more dangerous.

I have tried to express this trade off, and to make suggestions of how
to work within this frame work to hinder GAK take up:
(from Principle 4: deployment wins. Violating any of principles 1, 2 or 3
whilst still remaining better than GAK-neutral can be justified where
deployment is thereby increased to the extent that the reduced GAK
resistance of the product can be justified by the overall increase in
GAK resistancy in the target jurisdictions. This can be expressed
loosely as the equation: introduced resistancy = deployment x
resistancy rating
Corollary 4: Where a profit function outside the individuals control
interferes with GR maximisation of principle 4, continuing in this
environment may be justifiable where this tactic helps promote global
GAK resistance in the target jursidiction. Examples of novel ways of
making the best of this imposed profit function overlayed on the
solution space of designs may be: attempts to subvert standardisation
processes to make the standards GAK resistant even for GAK neutral
developers, or to code GAK resistant implementations for GR-neutral
employers without informing them of these coding decisions, or to
promote GR implementation and protocol design to contacts in the
cryptographic developer community, or to anonymously release useful
proprietary GR optimisation technology, or to sabotage ergonomics or
reliability functions in implementations of very low GR rated designs.
I agree.
It is a property of fielded systems that the majority of users will
work within the functionality provided by it.  This property can be
used by all 3 sides of the debate.  It is a politically neutral

A very good thing.
So can you use pgp5.0 to construct a CMR key which would
interoperate with pgp5.5 for business?
Clearly pgp5.0 does nothing with these flags on reciept, but does it
understand them when sending?
Scenario: I work for Mega Corp, and it is using pgp5.5, and is using
CMR with companies key.
Does pgp5.0 reply encrypting to just me as individual, or two crypto
recipients me, and Mega Corp recovery key?
I would be interested on clarification of this point.
Yes, I'm not so much arguing about the flexibility or the mechanism,
as what it is being used for.  I consider there are more secure and
more GAK resistant ways to acheive same functionality.
It is evil.  But it is not _as_ evil.
The reason for this is that government access to storage keys is not
as evil as government access to communications keys, because the
government has to come and capture the ciphertext (take your disk),
whereas with communications they can grab them via an arrangement with
your ISP.
Indeed.  It is of only marginal use.
See point above.
This is not avoidable for storage ... if you are encrypting data on
disk, and if you want recovery information, you have no choice but to
allow company access.
The recovery information should be as decentralised as much as
possible.  (Perhaps this should be the Stewart corollary).
The point though is that storage recovery is a completely separable
issue from communications "recovery" which is a euphamism for allowing
companies to read, or snoop, employees email, unless it is being used
soley for data recovery of mail stored in mail folders (which seems to
be what PGP Inc means by CMR term), in which case it is not necessary
functionality, and can be better acheived by encrypting the mail
archive with a user symmetric key with company storage recovery on
that key.
I would be interested to hear novel ways to minimise the likelihood
that the government could walk into your offices, grab the CD duke
box, grab the single corporate recovery key and walk off.
Decentralisation is one good way -- recovery keys are in hands of
department and group heads -- secret splitting is another good way --
and (your suggestion) omitting some of recovery bits is a small
addtional hinderance to intruders after plaintext.

Whoa there Bill.  They have customers who wanted data recovery.  Data
recovery does not require CMR.
Did they admit to customers who wanted human based email screening?
No on list discussions have suggested this is the case.  I think I saw
one PGP employee state that it was not the case.
(I have perfectly good, more secure CDR based human screening designs,
not that I encourage this you understand).
Small difference I think.
Nothing against SMTP filters, just against the CMR enforcement they
put into theirs.
You're using "you can hack around it" and "it is visible" arguments,
these are valid arguments which mitigate the danger, but don't
actually alter Tim and my points that storage recovery is less of a
problem than message recovery.
He made the same point in both respects.  I agree with his point about
I fully agree with Tim's points and Bill Frantz's example that old
email messages come back to haunt people and are a nightmare waiting
for a discovery process in a messy lawsuit for companies.  I nearly
got sucked into such a thing myself last year (some one gave back a
laptop to a company they just quit on bad terms from, tried to wipe it
but left some messages on it; the messages looked _bad_, the idiot who
did that sent the _bad_ message to me, my response was to phone him up
and say `what _are_ you talking about, I can't do that'.).
This to me argues that PGP Inc should make email archives user
controllable.  So that users decide which emails to archive and which
to just let naturally disappear, in the same way that phone calls, or
chats in a restaurant aren't transcibed and digitally signed.  Much
harder to prove.  I would also argue for "official statement" vs "chit
chat" distinction on emails -- don't archive, and certainly don't have
recovery of chit chat, use non-transferable sigs for chit chat, the
only person who cares about authenticity is the recipient, not the
legal system.  So I think this aspect belongs in coding in ways which
are beneficial to companies.
I guess the smtp filters leave stuff alone if they can't figure out
who it's to?  ie do default email thang -- which is probably what you
want if it's some privacy nut who is sending a "chit chat" class
message to one of your set of sales people.  don't do the explode to
all feature.
Sure.  It's also completely understandable that they do have financial
restrictions, my main argument was that they could build more GAK
resistant systems within those restrictions.
Yes, but you are in the US.  The recipient is in tinpotdictatorsville.
With pgp5.0 your software will by default honour the military police's
demand in tinpotdictatorsville.
This is why I am arguing that the system as a whole be considered --
you are trying to build GAK resistance into the deployed code base you
have to think long term and you have to think in terms of sabotaging
the system to make it unuseful to governments.
Consider also that software gets used in it's default configuration
95% of the time.  Not everyone is a information architect :-)
OK, well that's some monkeywrenching, but I guess that could be
prevented with some design reviews.  I won't be helping with those
design reviews -- any company who wants to improve enforcement of CMR
type designs can figure them out for themselves.

@_subject: what can we do about PGP sell out and CMR? 
To be clear: my efforts in CDR (data recovery) design alternatives, and GAK
resistant design principles are not because care one way or the other about
CDR going into the OpenPGP standard at this point, they were soley to
persuade PGP Inc that there are more GAK resistant ways to achieve same
functionality, which then negates need for CMR extensions.
The CDR proposal is about data recovery which means that it could be
argued to be outside the scope of OpenPGP; it is about how to
implement recovery within mail archives in a MUA, such as pgp5.x mail
Also re. subject line, I now think that it is not a sell out, just a
design mistake; they have good intentions, and have not sold those
out, but have failed to optimally transfer those intentions into the
protocol design.

@_subject: what can we do about PGP sell out and CMR? 
I take your comments to be directed at my Corporate Data Recovery
(CDR) proposal which I presented as a more GAK resistant alternative
than PGP Inc's Corporate Message Recovery (CMR) proposal.
Data recovery is less dangerous than communications recovery.
Scenario  (comms recovery): government mandates everyone gives them
comms recovery key (CMR key).  Government can key word scan all your
messages in real time.  If you are non-technical and don't know to
hack around it you either comply or are caught out, and suffer penalty
for breaking law.
Scenario  (data recovery): government mandates everyone gives them
data recovery key (CDR key).  If government raids your offices or
home, they can recover your plaintext.  If they do not raid your home
they can not.  Raiding homes is expensive.  They can't raid all homes
because they do not have the money.  Also, they can't check whether
you are using GAK software -- until they raid you they won't know.
When they raid you you are likely in trouble anyway, so you may as
well not use GAK software if you figure you are likely to be raided.
Therefore GAK on data doesn't work as well, and doesn't as much affect
the balance of power between citizens and governments as GAK on
communications does.
Can you see flaws in this reasoning?

High quality anonymous post, which I'll comment on below.  I have my
suspicions as to who this person is; I won't comment on who, but I do
appreciate his thoughtful comments.
You missed one scenario, which corporates are probably going to like
better than you imagine.  The reason they will like it better than you
imagine is because you believe in privacy; they do not.  You belief in
privacy is making you unrealistically optimistic about companies
respect for privacy.
The missed scenario is:
If you are non-technical (which most people are not), you would then
be forced to use this.  This is because the SMTP policy enforcer will
bounce the mail if you do not.
Your expectation of privacy is respected, because you expect none.
However if the system is used for other than anticipated purposes,
such as perhaps as a GAK enforcement mechanism in
tinpotdictatorsville, it is not just expectation of privacy concerns
which will concern you.  It is civil rights issues.
You have a dual concern: you are trying to protect against big brother
and against little brother.
The way that your concerns about little brother have been transferred
into the protocol resulting in the CMR mechanism has not added
anything at all to protection against little brother; protection
against little brother are largely statement of intent issues.
However you do raise a fresh point in this debate below.
This is clever reasoning.  I have not seen anyone raise this objection
However, you neglect that there is something which is incredibly
highly deployed: hardly anyone is using disk encryption software.  So
the mostly widely installed user base already has the possibility for
someone else in the company to decrypt it: the plaintext is an easier
tarket than CDR recoverable data in my system.
Your second distinction then resides in the claim that the email is
still encrypted in the mail folder, and it has no recovery
True enough, it doesn't.
However what you are really saying is that the system has been
purposefully designed to respect employees rights to receive private
email.  This design decision is implemented at a higher level than the
protocol level.  This design decision is independent of the use of CMR
or CDR.
You can easily implement private email with CDR.  You can provide two
keys: one for private use and one for company use.  Or you can the
email as private or not.  Or you can give the user the ability to
control independently for each email:
is it archived (yes/no)
is the archive recoverable (yes/no)
I have been arguing for these features to be put in also, which
demonstrates that I have just as much concern for privacy as you do.
I like the statement intent of plaintext handling flag.  It is
independent of the protocol level, and can be used for either system.
This is dangerous.  Companies could lose lots of money over this when
they are sued and a discovery process is used to recover all business
communiations.  Lawyers will be poring over those communications.
Most of them will have been written with under 1 minutes thought.  The
lawyer will be able to find lots of things to pick legal nits in.  He
will build a case, and your company will lose a fortune.
This is why you should give user control over what is archived.  He
can decide to archive things he thinks of import to keep for company
records.  The rest can be lost.  It is also why you should do
something somebody else suggested to me in email: have signatures
which expire.
The expectation of privacy is based on trust.  It can not be enforced,
as you acknowledged above.  The statement of intent expectation of
privacy can be encoded in the key independent of data recovery method.
You can add as many privacy features as you want on top of CDR.
Whether your implementation changes the status quo positively or
negatively is your decision; you have full control in which features
you provide.
I thought that PGP stated that companies wanted to be able to recover
stored archived email for employee performance benefits.
No.  You can add the exact same framework for statement of intent, and
of what is and what is not archived.  This is a completely orthogonal
Visibility and explicitness are acheiveable with either system.
What would you rather:
- government recovery of those parts of the data which users
voluntarily select to be stored in ways which can be recovered (after
government raid of offices)
- government key word scanning all email in transit without needing to
raid offices.
PGP Inc's CMR design is flawed because you have focused on privacy
concerns which can be equally acheived with the CDR design; and you
have done so at the expense of building a system which offers little
resistance to being adopted by goverment to build a communications
snooping, keyword scanning system.
I didn't propose it as a secretive access system, I proposed it as a
recovery system.  Of course, it can be perverted to be one in the same
way that CMR can be; both systems can be perverted.  I argued that the
software should be designed to make it as hard as possible to bypass.
This won't be hard because software modifications can acheive it.
My proposal is to allow users to selectively archive what they want
to, and to selectively allow users to allow corporate recovery of what
they want.
The CMR system is not self correcting.  The CMR system means that
companies can snoop all of the email (that the sender hasn't taken
steps to hack around CMR key).  With my proposal in adition the
recipient can delete things he would rather not keep around.
CMR invites even worse kinds of abuse.  It invites wide scale
government abuse of keyword scanning email.
CMR is even worse because every last email can be recovered.
disagree on both counts, as explained variously above.
They are less prone to abuse as I have stated them above.  But the
proness to abuse depends on the functionality you are demanding of
them in as far as that affects design, ultimately I think they can
both be hacked with equivalent ease in either direction (more privacy,
less privacy).
Disagree.  Expectations of privacy are orthogonal issues.
this charge applies to CMR software.  Third party snooping of
communications is infinitely more dangerous than snooping of stored
In a company environment the company has control.  He can install a
keyboard sniffer when you are out of the office.  He can replace your
software.  This applies to both systems.  With CMR the company can all
email without the receiver having any choice.  With CDR the reciever
can choose to archive or not to archive.  He can choose to allow
recovery or not.
Next talk about government dangers.
With CMR if this technology is adopted by governments, and the OpenPGP
standard is allowed to include CMR technology we have keyword
scanning.  The CMR technology will allow government to know when the
unskilled person is cheating.
With CDR, if the government demands escrow of all storage keys the
government has no way of knowing if you are cheating with out breaking
into your building/house.  If you consider the government will break
in, you don't have much to lose by not using the key the government
has escrowed.
It is trying to do something useful, and the people who are proposing
it have good privacy preserving intentions.
I think it is failing to meet those intentions well, becuase the
privacy preserving, statement of intent, and non-hackability for
companies are all orthogonal issues to the choice between CDR and CMR.
CDR offers significant extra protection against government perversion
of the software authors intent.
data recovery good, communications recovery bad.

in using the CMR method.
  Is the CMR field to allow the company to recover from the user

In that case recovery can be much more simply and securely achieved
locally to the recipient.  Escrow or use locally stored recovery
information.  The CMR key is not needed for this functionality.
This is an independently good idea and would mitigate some of the
possibilites of CMR functionality being used for purposes other than
it's designers intended.
However it is hard to do; and the keys have different security focus
becuase it is hard to use user <-> user end to end TLS because of the
store and forward nature of email.

I think so yes.  I think I am able to demonstrate situations where
there is a trade-off: you can trade government resistance against
little brother resistance.
PGP Inc's CMR I believe is a form of this; they have nice
recommendations for companies, statement of intents for plaintext
handling, and transparent statements of when email is a company
recoverable email address.
But way that they have implemented this functionality I believe could
be perverted for uses other than their intentions by governments.
I think this means that the resulting system has traded off weaker
government resistance to acheive marginally stronger little brother
resistance.  (I may even say no stronger little brother resistance, I
think CDR can acheive same functionality).
The best example I can think of is France.  Other governments (US/UK)
people say: it'll never happen; tin pot dictator scenarios people are
less worried about because they feel the dictator will do unreasonable
things in any case.
The situation in France is: currently (or recently) you could not use
encryption at all without a license.  The enforcement rate is low to
zero.  (Jerome Thorel interviewed the head of SCSSI (NSA equivalent),
and they said that if you asked for a license for personal use they
would say "no", but if you didn't bother asking and used PGP2.x
anyway, they wouldn't do anything about it typically).
Now I understand the French have switched position: you can use
encryption without a license *provided* that it has master key access
for the government.
Lets say then that our aim is to design the OpenPGP standard and the
pgp5.5 implementation to be as resistant to use by the French
government as possibe.
With the pgp standard as is french government could insist that people
use pgp5.x.  pgp5.x provides a reasonablly useful framework for the
french government to adapt to be used as a master access system.
Because this will then be explicitly allowed, more people are likely
to use it.  (Current people using pgp2.x illegally are one suspects
the french cypherpunks subset of the population).  This means that the
french government can start to ramp up enforcement as there are less
objections (you _can_ protect confidentiality for business and privacy
uses, use this: pgp5.x).
If on the other hand pgp5.x were to use only single recipients for
confidentiality, and to base company recovery of encrypted mail
folders on key recovery information stored locally alongside the
mailbox the system would be less useful to the french government.
It is more than that I think.
This is because many people acknowledge legitimacy of companies to a)
encrypt data b) to recover data in case employee forgets keys, or dies
Second party access to stored data is much less scary.  Little brother
can ultimately read _everything_ you do at work.  If he gets
suspicious he can install keyboard logger, keyboard password sniffer,
or concealed videocam whilst you are out of the office.  The best we
can do is discourage little brother from abusing systems designed for
data recovery as mass communications snooping.  The best suggestion I
have seen for this so far was Bill Stewart's suggestion to only store
recovery info for some of the bits.  Make the recovery process
artificially slow: say 40 bits.  Worth it for recovering main
developers design notes made in email when he dies unexpectedly.  Some
hinderance to little brother unless he is determined.  As long as this
hinderance is similar scale to other similar things little brother
could do to check up on suspicious user, you have achieved your goal
of hindering little brother.
Big brother is hindered very significantly if you do recovery locally,
rather than on the communications link as PGP Inc CMR does.  This is
because big brother does not have access to the ciphertext on disks.
He must come and take them.  Whereas for communications he can
practically acheive access to your email ciphertext at push button
Your email communications are already secret split with the NSA: the
data is split into to unequally sized halves: the _key_ and the
_ciphertext_.  For this reason you really don't want the NSA to get
that key.
For data storage recovery, your data is again in two halves: you have
one, the _key_, your employee/you have the other, the _ciphertext_ on
disk.  Your employee can recover that info anyway.  The NSA can't
easily.  It is much more logistically expensive to collect or randomly
sample disk contents.

Valid argument with some value yes.  Actually now that you bring it up
I dimly remember this aspect being raised on cypherpunks some time
back.  Perhaps it was you who raised it even.  Or perhaps it was Phil
Karn, or someone.
Hmmm.  I think that if companies start encrypting anything, they're
going to need recovery of some sort.  Else they just won't use it at
Most of them aren't using storage encryption right now anyway, which
is why Tim May's suggestion to store emails after decrypt in the clear
makes a lot of sense as a simple interim way out of this problem until
the issues have been explored more.
This largely avoids company requirement to recover emails.
One valid objection to this approach is that if the employee forgets
their password whilst there are lots of emails queued up to receive
that those emails will be lost.  Or if the employee gets hit by a
However I'm not so sure this is a big deal for a number of reasons:
1. how often do employees get hit by trucks?
2. how often do employees forget passwords? (all the time unfortunately)
3. things which are important the sender is likely able to resend because
   he has in clear on disk
4. senders using the same software can have archives of what they have sent
   and easily able to resend.
If you are right, it will bounce when it hits an enforcer with the
strict setting turned on.
Is this what will happen?
This will mean that the users will have to manually figure out how to
solve (get enforcer key, multiple encrypt to that key, possibly by
cc'ing to enforcer email address/userID even if this bounces).
Lack of automation is some weak protection.  What are users to do?
Send Cc: .  What if they forget?  Much more
plausible to forget.  Makes strict penalties for forgetting difficult
in western countries.  5 years jail time for forgetting?  Don't think
What about the traffic?  If you make it an invalid address, just to
pick up the key it'll flood email systems with bounces; every single
encrypted mail will get a bounce.
Not an overwhelming protection, but may mean more people will more
resist it, and more people will forget often with the current email
MUA deployed base.
With many people using CMR based pgp5.5, forgetting will be much less
Putting in CMR encourages adoption of this kind of filtering/bouncing
I am interested in analysis and discussion of the level of
significance this difference makes to user uptake of GAK in say the US
as an example (say some time in 1998 when many more businesses and
individuals have upgraded to pgp5.x).  What differences are there in
resistance between a pgp5.5 using CMR and with a pgp5.6 using CDR (or
storage-CAK as Bill terms the approach)?
Yes.  This is the kind of reason I argue that storage recovery is less
dangerous than communications recovery.  They've got to get the disk
first.  And they can't tell if you have used GAK until they get it;
when they get it if you're suspecting they will try this, you will
ensure there is no GAK access, you will use other software, as you
have nothing to lose.
Well that is the scenario that Freeh is arguing for yes.  Faced with a
choice of giving him your comms keys or your storage keys, I'd go for
storage keys anyday.  I can lie to him, and give him some random
numbers and he'll never know.  The point at which he will know will be
after the dawn raid; if it gets to dawn raids you are indendently in
trouble anyway.
Technically yes.  Practically no, there is a large difference.  The
extra protection of Storage-CAK method is the extra GAK resistance due
to the fact that availability of access to communications is patchy,
and more expensive for the government to achieve, and enforcement is
patchy, even detection is patchy.  This patchiness is good.  Mass
keyword scanning is impossible on a wide scale.  The government can
keyword scan some of you, but they can do that already at similar cost
levels: they can plant bugs, have undercover federal investigator
inflitrate your company in guise of employee etc.  The aim of the game
is to make the cost higher than existing physical attacks, or at least
as high as possible.
Surely it does?
If you are in ACME Corp and they want all disks encrypted as a
security policy.  They provide smart cards to employees, and
workstations data is inaccessible until correct smart card is
inserted.  Employee lets dog chew on smart card.  No recovery implies
that this data is irretrievably lost.
This is good.  Both systems are hackable from all three directions.
(individuals can hack around system to increase privacy; corporations
can hack around to decrease privacy (keyboard sniffer); governments
can too by walking in and taking disks and threatening people fail
time for not handing over keys.)  Many aspects of this are better with
storage data recovery than they are with communications recovery.
Especially government aspects.  Company aspects are almost neutral
non-issue in my mind due to ease with which company can remove your
privacy as they own machines, and can do all sorts of things to your
software, hardware, video cam, bug phone, keyboard sniffer, keyboard
log, etc.,etc.
Yes.  pgp5.0 which I looked at windows version (available on
ftp://ftp.replay.com/ (netherlands) somewhere for other non-US
people), does file and email encryption.  As does linux version.
Good point.
PGP Inc does use this otherwise there would be no argument about need
for recovery information -- you don't need recovery information for
Your example of corruption problems with large mail boxes is one
argument against this practice.

I have described the CDR proposal in some detail, and have been able
to counter all arguments raised against it.
It is vaporware, but there are people who are offering to implement it
as an extension to systemics PGP capable library as a demonstrator for
the OpenPGP standardisation process to show how it would work in
You do have a point in that I should collect my arguments and write a
paper describing the tradeoffs.  I am in the process of doing this,
and will be interested in yours and others comments on this proposal.
I fail to follow your argument.  Could you explain further?  I am very
interested in discussion of the realism of scenarios for ways that GAK
might be enforced in various types of regimes examples being perhaps:
- Singapore hi-tech, but somewhat authoritarian government
- US, UK hi-tech, government interested in installing GAK (with
  euphamisms being used such as TTP (UK), "Key recovery"/"key escrow"
  (US)).
- Muslim countries, some oil rich, largely I think currently
- France with current position of no use of crypto without license
  (not typically availble), low enforcement rate (individuals use crypto
  with very low likelihood of prosecution), but more recent moves to
  allow unlicensed crypto which has mandatory access.
In what way does replacing the sendmail infrastructure have relevance?
You can always communicate in the clear so I am not claiming you can
not commmunicate, just that there are interesting interactions between
deployed software bases and different jurisdictions with different
legal restrictions on cryptography (ranging from none to weakly
enforced mandatory access, to heavily enforced mandatory access to ban
on cryptography).  If you consider this legal framework, the dynamics
of the ways that you can best estimate GAK will be introduced, and the
likelihood for each jurisidction, the enforcement rate, severity of
penalty for failure to comply, you have a very complex system. I would be interested to see comments on these issues, and what issues
this raises for protocol designers and software implementors.
My GAK resistant design principles attempt to provide useful rules of
thumb in making individual software systems, international standards,
and the distributed system formed of the deployed user base, and
enforcement rates, severities maximally resistant to GAK.
My claim is that software implementations, and messaging standards
such as OpenPGP are not neutral in this process.  I think this is a
relatively obvious statement, which most would agree with.  I know
that PGP Inc has spent a lot of time considering alternatives on these
kinds of issues, and on privacy issues.
There are regimes which would like to allow the government to read all
communications where it would not be practical to outlaw encryption
because many people can demonstrate a business case for it.
You live in one such regime: the US.  I live in another such regine:
the UK.
It does not imply that at all.  If you presume that you wish to
communicate securely, faced with the above scenario, you are faced
with the choice I described: don't communicate at all, or communicate
I shall continue simply because I consider I have no moral
alternative, than to try to explore more GAK resistant variants of
CMR, or additions to CMR. Or to explore the CDR alternative approach
as a plausible alternative more resistant to GAK take over.
If you have any specific objections to my technical points, or
strategic analysis of usefulness of the two proposals in frustrating
government mass email snooping I would be interested to have you
discuss them.
That is a worth while endeavour independently.  However PGP Inc has
financial and implementational constraints (such as plugin APIs, and
so forth) which it naturally must work within.  Asking more than this
is not reasonable; these are the laws of gravity in the problem space.
To produce something which meets PGP Inc's design constraints seems
much more valuable to me than independent freeware or payware attempts
to explore alternative approaches simply because PGP is likely to have
the largest deployed base.  Increasing the resistance of PGP Inc's
systems by even a marginal amount is therefore automatically valuable.
I presume you are here referring to my suggestion that forward secrecy
would make the system more resistant to GAK take over.
PGP already has a mechanism to deal with short term encryption keys:
the expiry mechanism which has been available starting with pgp5.0.
The only novel suggestion relating to this is to reduce the expiry
period, to reduce exposure of keys.  This does not seem a radical
proposal.  It is independently a good security improvement.
Tim May has suggested that the simplest way to deal with the problems
of recovery is just to store the received email in clear text.
If PGP would like to enhance security of email archives by storing
them in encrypted then CDR is one practical way to do that.
This is a good suggestion.  It would be an improvement over allowing
CMR traffic to appear in the outer layer.  Jon Callas, Attila T Hun,
and Bill Stewart were discussing variations of this.  My suggestion
for forward secrecy could also be used in this way, and has similar
motivation, but is not necessarily end-to-end, as I gave specific
examples in my previous reply to you attempted to show.
A hybrid approach like this would be somewhere between the two systems
in resistance to government abuse.  It is a definate improvement.
Please don't give up on the debate as threatened above Kent;
constructive ideas like this are useful as they explore a wider
spectrum of properties in the proposed system variants.

@_subject: why we are arguing for more resistant variants (Re: Is PGP still private?) 
Thanks for the vote of confidence Toto.
Also I must raise the point that it is not a lone stand.  Other people
are arguing against PGP Inc's CMR proposal, and are arguing for more
GAK resistant variants, and alternatives.  Several amongst those who have so argued are higher reputation than
myself: Bruce Schneier, (plus some others with similar crypto
credentials I have asked for comments from off list which I can not
reveal due to ethics of email confidentiality).  I have some small
about of credibility myself I think also.
In addition I consider myself, Tim May, Peter Trei, Attila T Hun, and
the many others arguing for more resistant variants to have some
reputation, and it seems unlikely to me that we would all burn our
reputations over an insignifcant point.  We are collectively arguing
because (and I think the others will agree) we think that there are
more resistant variants than the CMR proposal used in pgp5.5.  These
variants are also practical within the constraints imposed by the
plug-in APIs, and user requirements PGP must work within, I believe.
Even Kent Crispin who seemed to dismiss the first round as an
insignificant difference, is offering more resistant variants.  PGP
Inc's Jon Callas together with cypherpunks Bill Stewart, Attila T Hun,
and myself were also arguing that even TLS (transport level security),
or in other words an extra encryption envelope over the recovery
information is an improvement.  (Particularly if you do as I argue for
and try to make the TLS keys user owned where possible, and try to
make the system as forward secrect as possible).
However the biggest point of all is that: communications keys are more
valuable to any attacker (government, unscrupulous little brother, or
industrial spy) than storage keys.
I would be interested to see any one willing to burn their
reputational capital refuting that simple point.
That point is the simple central starting point for all arguments
about the dangers of allowing recovery information to be transmitted
with the communication.  Recovery information should be local
whereever possible.  Bruce Schneier had harsh words to say about
violating this principle in one of his recent cypherpunks posts.

@_subject: Is PGP still private? 
I didn't abandon it as such, but more recognised some dangers in a
system involving re-encryption and sending messages to backup servers
being twisted for government purposes.  But even re-encryption is more
resistant to GAK than PGP Inc's CMR.  The danger with re-encryption is
that the person the mail is being re-encrypted and sent to could be
changed to be the government.  However this presents more logistic
problems for the government than does the PGP Inc CMR method.
I switched to storage key recovery (not quite key escrow btw), because
I realised this was yet more resistant to being abused by governments.
The CDR (Corporate Data Recovery) proposal is that communications keys
would not be escrowed, and that messages would be only encrypted to
one key (the recipients key).  Those emails which were archived, and
which the user consider important could be encrypted with the
recovered key.  The recovery information would be stored locally and
the software would attempt were possible to make it difficult to move
the recovery information off the machine.
No.  I think it is practical.  I also think that it is more resistant to
government abuse (where the worst form of government abuse is mass
keyword scanning of all messages.)
I haven't seen anyone able to argue against these two claims.  I
encourage anyone who can see technical objections, or objections to
the claim that this design is more resistant to abuse to speak up.

@_subject: Security flaws introduced by "other readers" in CMR 
I talked to some people at CESG (Communications Electronics Security
Group) (they are part of GCHQ, UK NSA equivalent) in a business
setting.  It was they who said that France was changing position to
going over to "key escrow" or TTPs (Trusted Third Parties).  From
their point of view they seemed to view this as a good development,
because they could use France as an example of a progressive, socially
responsible government which the UK government should follow the
example of.  They were very happy with this because they could use it
in their arguments to attempt to persuade the UK government and
Perhaps the CESG are exaggerating because they would like this to be
the case because it suits their argument.
But on the other hand, it seems likely that CESG have had talks with
DGSE and SCSSI and it seems probable this really is what these French
government organisations really are planning for.  Probably there are
opposing elements in the French government also.  But CESG/GCHQ are
vying for those elements which are in favour of "TTPs" to win.
You can see how each new government that takes the TTP or key escrow
stance allows the secret services and governments in other countries
to clamour for their countries to follow suit.
People can also see I hope how PGP Inc in influencing an
international standard (IETF OpenPGP) to include explicit support for
third party access to communications traffic is dangerous.  However
this is not the biggest danger, the biggest danger is that PGP Inc are
implementing software solutions (pgp5.5) which as far as I can see, in
all honesty, could literally be useful to the French government and
others like it.  If the French government adopt it, or a system
implemented by a European company with the same functionality (that
pgp5.5 has this functionality means others must follow for financial
reasons in being compatible), then pro-GAK government agencies will
point to this as a success story.  Already Bruce Schneier quoted from
the US congressional record where some GAKkers were praising pgp5.5
functionality in demonstrating their case that GAKware is possible.
Do they actually mention PGP software, or OpenPGP standard?  Or just
the general principle?
It is reasurring to hear that my analysis is supported by others.  I
am trying to think through what a GAKker would want and predict what
they will be interested in seeing in standards and in off the shelf
products.  From that I am interested to use this estimate as a basis
to design systems which resist the GAKkers desires, by denying any
functionality which supports their requirements where this can be done
within the normal user requirement constraint.
It is difficult with arguments against a company such as PGP Inc which
has a very high reputation capital due to Phil Zimmermann and large
privacy following, because some people will oppose what you are saying
just on principle without listening to the logic, they will say "you
must be wrong, because PGP would never do that."
But, the simple fact is that I think PGP Inc have not evaluated these
indirect implications for GAK politics.  This means I think that they
have pure intentions.  Unfortunately these pure intentions do not help
us if the effect is as I fear: that the result helps the GAKkers to
some significant amount.
You confirm my suspicions.  I have several people I know in France who
use encryption illegally.  Not least of these is Jerome Thorel himself
:-) (He who interviewed the SCSSI and had it spelt out to him that it
was illegal, but they wouldn't bother you if you didn't ask
permission).  However those that I know are effectively anti-GAK
activists, or cypherpunk type individuals.
It is not really that technical an idea.  The idea is simply that
communications keys are more valuable to government than storage keys.
Keyword scanning is what governments want; they probably don't care
too much about storage keys, they are much more expensive to collect
ciphertext for (dawn raids for disks), and are much more difficult to
enforce (who knows what keys are really being used to encrypt data on
your disk, until the point of the dawn raid).
The reason is that they consider it purely a recovery mechanism for
stored emails.  That it has this side effect of making a product which
could be used for other purposes is currently considered an
insignificant risk by them, I think.  I think their analysis in this
regard is flawed.
There you have the Tim May proposal.  Do not recover, just store in
clear.  Most data on disks already is, so why bother.  If you want to
encrypt work out those problems when you come to them, as a separable
issue.  This is a very compelling argument to me.
Not that I can see.  I think it really is that obvious.
I agree, my confusion also: why do people not understand this.  There
are some very bright people at PGP Inc, why do they not see it in
these terms.
He may not need authorization.  I'm not sure MI5 (UK military
intelligence branch) asked authorization before sending an SAS swat
team into BBC head-quarters to confiscate tapes of a secret service
documentary.  Still that one failed because the BBC had hidden backups
:-) (Smart cookies:-) They aired the film later.  No one knows I
suppose whether it was edited before airing.
Also this is the status quo.  Already the police, or terrorist
prevention investigators can inflitrate, perform dawn raids, etc. and
this is as it should be.
I can't believe anyone who understands cryptography even remotely
could possibly argue against the fact that communications keys are
more valuable to an attacker.  This seems very obvious.
Readers may note Bruce Schneier's remark earlier in this discussion
that he too couldn't believe someone would not separate storage keys
from communications keys.

Motivation is irrelevant.  The road to hell is paved with good
intentions.  All the sides in the argument (except for Freeh and the
USG/NSA) have good intentions (and perhaps even Freeh from his
perspective).  Fooh on good intentions.  Let's keep this discussion
focussed on:
  The design of systems which are hard for governments to abuse in
  introducing GACK
You made one contribution in this area in your last post.  Keep up the
technical contributions, and scenario likelihood evaluations.
If it doesn't need to be argued, why does pgp2.x and pgp5.x use long
term communication keys?  Why does pgp5.x then go exacerbate this
problem encouraging use of not one but two long term communications
keys.  Why does it provide recovery methods for long term
communications keys when the stated user requirement is to recover
stored email archives?
ie. the discussion just took this form:
Adam: X is a bad security idea.  X is used in pgp2.x and pgp5.x
Kent: modification Y to pgp5.x doesn't make it any worse
Adam: So?  It's still a bad idea, and here are ways to make it more
      secure, and harder for governments to abuse to boot
Kent: ?  (we're waiting)
Surely the most straight forward way to provide recovery for email
archives is to archive the emails encrypted to a storage-only key,
with this key escrowed in some way?  You then don't need to recover
email in transit -- you don't even have a copy of it.
This is clearly more resistant to government abuse.  Do you disagree?
(The above paragraph is basically all my CDR proposal is .. it seems
straight forward, intuitive, more secure; I went through and countered
your previous objections to worked example  you did not reply to
those counter-points).
You missed a couple:
3) the goverment will love to get come ask for your CMR key because it
protects all past emailed ciphertext
4) some governments (eg France) will probably ask for one of the CMR
keys to be theirs
Yes.  Several people have suggested this.  Also secret sharing is
being considered by PGP Inc for the next version I think.
I would think so.  This would argue for updating the CMR
communications key as frequency as is practicable to minimise danger.
(Same argument as update requirements for user communications keys).
Hal Finney discussed this requirement of matching expiry frequency on
comms keys & corresponding CMR keys a few messages back.
This suggests that Tim May is right, and the simplest solution is to
store the decrypted received emails in clear on the disk.  Most of the
companies are in fact storing on disk.
Could you provide a less emotive suitable alternative word which I can
use as a replacement to describe government communications key
grabbing attempts?  GACK is what Carl Ellison proposed as a more
accurate way to express "Goverment Access to Communications Keys" than
terms such as "key escrow", "key recovery", which are government
coined terms.  PGP Inc themselves being mostly cypherpunks and
pro-privacy people use the term GACK also.
GACK seems a pretty good acronym to me, accurate, descriptive.  Are we
getting goverment-correct now as well (as politically-correct)?  So
that we must not use terms which are offensive to governments?
(I will attempt to avoid negative political comments about PGP Inc's
implementation, and phrase in terms of constructive criticisms though,
and perhaps this was your point given my earlier outbursts in this
regard; perhaps you can help proof read for this).

There is a precedent for this of sorts in France.  You probably recall
that prior to the netscape 40 bit breaks, there were 3 versions of
- 128 bit US only non-exportable
- 40 bit exportable
- no SSL at all -- French version
After Damien Doligez hit the headlines with his first break of 40 bit
SSL, and the other breaks had similar headlines, the French
authorities noticed -- "oh," they thought, "if those cypherpunks can
break it, so can DGSE" -- I understood that from that point on they
allowed 40 bit SSL netscape browsers in France.  (At least someone
reported about this on list).  That Damien himself is French and was
working at a researcher at INRIA(?) of all places only adds to the
irony.  (That Damien had a his PGP key at the bottom of his web page
which must have attracted 100,000s of hits after that also is somewhat
amusing, illegal PGP usage, and no one said a word).
Anyway, my perhaps rude jibe to Jonathan Seybold, PGP Inc's chairman a
few days back that PGP should "make a sales pitch to French DGSE" was
not so far off after all.
Course there is still the export problem.  Perhaps eventually the NSA
and DGSE/SCSSI, CESG/GCHQ will come to some kind of reciprocal
agreement, and then there will be another export exemption in the US
following on from the 56 bit DES exemption for companies which can
demonstrate they are working to a 2 year schedule to have key escrow
built in.
Or perhaps some european competitor will provide pgp5.5 compatible
software to them (with support for multiple CMR keys, something not
yet in pgp5.5, but already accepted without problem, and planned I
gather for the next major release).
This is true, it could be done largely with multiple recipient feature
in 2.x.  Bill Stewart and William Geiger and I think PGP's Jon Callas
pointed this out.
However I think that:
a) this is no excuse to actually _implement_ it!
b) PGP implementing this kind of thing encourages others to do so
also as they could become the defacto standards setter (particularly
with this almost certainly going in OpenPGP standard, and PGP defining
the semantics of the CMR either in or outside the standard to be what
they have done in pgp5.5)
c) it sets out the design work for other companies less scrupulous
companies such as TIS, etc. to interoperate marginally more smoothly
with pgp installed base when they implement something even worse
compatible with OpenPGP.
d) the alternative I proposed, or especially Tims alternative are even
simpler if anything to implement
Monty Cantsin said this.  I said similar things also, and got shouted
out by PGP Inc people for being rude.
I don't think so, I hope not anyway.
It seems somewhat fair enough if it was much more difficult to do that
this might be difficult to acheive within their budget and user
delivery date demands, etc.
But, Tim's proposal to store in clear seems easy enough.
My alternative on top of that is merely to encrypt the mail folder
with pgp -c; they've got all the technology sitting there.  It is only
a simple scripting task.  If I was William Geiger I would say that you
could knock that up over the week end in a few scripts.  I expect I
could too :-) (eg. if I knew emacs elisp, I reckon it would be easy
enough to decrypt the mailbox prior to use, and re-encrypt after use.
Or to do the same on a per message basis after decryption, or for all
messages encrypted or not.  Perhaps I'll have a go at getting Pat
Lopresti to add this for mailcrypt.el v3.5).
The task isn't any harder for them.
It is not a technical objection, or at least I have seen no technical
objections so far.
I think it is purely a privacy objection: they have worked out some
privacy preserving principles, and to enforce them they have come up
with this approach.  The message snooping dangers seem to have been
overlooked, or considered unavoidable trade-offs to achieve their
privacy objectives.  They are simply wrong in this regard.
Political arguments stand a better chance with PGP Inc than with most

I think Bill's point was more that you would make recovery harder.
That is you have two ways into the messages: your passphrase, and some
recovery information (a second copy of your private key).  He
suggested that you miss off some bits, to discourage companies from
abusing what was meant to be a disaster recovery system being used as
a storage recovery system.

@_subject: encryption key expiry in pgp5.x 
What happens in this scenario with pgp5.0, or pgp5.5:
- You have a signature key which you'll keep for say 2 years before
  creating a new one.
- You have a policy of generating new encryption keys every 6 months.
- Your email archives are stored as received still encrypted to your
  public encryption key (I think you have no choice but to do this with
  some of the pgp5.x plugins).
- You expire the key, and securely wipe the private half of the key.
  (An advantage of rekeying in this way is to gain forward secrecy:
  messages gathered by an attacker can no longer be decrypted with
  information you have, but to get the forward secrecy you must
  literally securely wipe the private key).
If you do this, you won't be able to read your old mail folder,
because you no longer have the key it was encrypted to.
Does this imply that you must keep the private key for perpetuity?
(Or at least as long as you want to read old mail archives).
One presumes the same problem applies to CMR recovery keys, they must
also be kept as long as recovery is required, if the user forgets the

I think the CMR public key extension is not limited to one CMR extra
recipient per key.  Closely following discussions on ietf-open-pgp,
and the notes Bill Stewart kindly posted to this list (taken from the
description PGP Inc gave at a meeting in the US) it sounded to me that
there is a migration path like this:
pgp5.0: accepts keys with multiple CMR key requests attached but
pgp5.5: generates keys with single CMR requests, can accept and handle
pgp6.x: will generate keys with multiple CMR requests (and of course This suggests that the yet to be released pgp6.x (or whatever version
number is chosen) will be able to cater to such government demands
merely by the company generating their keys with two CMR requests:
recovery at acme.com
thoughtpolice at nsa.gov
The NSA can publish their public key on  tomorrow,
and the law by presidential decree the day after.  This is the
balanced Sword of Damocles over privacy for real now: this is the switch waiting to be flicked.  This is why I am upset with PGP Inc
for using the CMR approach.  It is not CMR per se as a neutral mechanism, but it is the approach of building tools which
allow third party access, or "recovery" of communications traffic which
has enabled all of this.
This despite their stated corporate user requirement being storage
I agree, it is a centralised security risk.  PGP Inc are talking about
adding secret splitting perhaps, but still it is a security risk.  The
whole technique of sending recovery information over the wire is a
security risk.  Recovery information if there is any should be kept on
local disks and thereby be protected by the companies normal physical
security in the same way that papers in filing cabinets are.  This is
the status quo.  (Well actually no encryption at all locally is
largely the status quo, but pgp5.0 (and I presume pgp5.5) is also able
to encrypt files, and PGP Inc argues more reasonably that their corporate clients have a requirement of being able to recover stored encrypted files also).
Regardless it is trivial to have local storage recovery without
sending recovery information over the wire.  I'll be posting (web and
list) a security analysis of CMR vs CDR presently; I think CMR loses
badly from even a purely security oriented standpoint.  (I have made
my feelings about the political demerits of CMR as a storage recovery
mechanism known already).
Perhaps this is what they are busy building at their top-sikrit crypto
software development/research center at Cambridge, UK under the
guidance of new head of research cryptographer Roger Needham.  Looks like an export embargo end-run by Bill Gates.

@_subject: CDR design document 
Here is a proposal for consideration for inclusion in the OpenPGP
(Also attached text version below [1])
It describes a mechanism for commercial data recovery which attempts
to minimise the security risks inherent in allowing disaster recovery
of stored encrypted documents.  The CDR design also avoids the
security risks in building systems which send recovery information
over open communications networks, as the CMR proposal currently does.
The CDR design offers the option of more ergonomic recovery from
forgotten passphrase.  CDR allows for more secure use to be made of
the existing pgp5.0 key expiry functionality when applied to
communications-only keys because they can be deleted with out loss of
data-availability, providing a form of PFS which is backwards
compatible with pgp5.0 and pgp5.5 clients.
The only change addition to the standard required is to create a
distinction between a storage only key and a communications only key.
This distinction could be made via the use of an extra flag, ideally
so that keyrings can remain standardised and interchangeable between
different implementations.
The document can also be viewed as a recommendation to implementors of
how to avoid security risks (and related government abuse risks) in
implementing data recovery systems.
I would like to see the OpenPGP standard accomodate both the CMR and
CDR design so that each can fly on it's technical merits.  (And
political merits, cryptography being a highly political field, a
politically unpopular design may suffer for other than technical
[1]	
Commercial Data Recovery
This document describes a mechanism, Commercial Data Recovery (CDR), to
allow companies to recover stored encrypted information as part of a
disaster recovery plan.
This document is centered around the OpenPGP standard, and therefore
explores first what is possible within the existing standard. Several of the
CDR variants presented can be achieved entirely within the pgp5.0 standard
without adding any new functionality.
Commercial disaster recovery requirement
PGP is commonly used for two purposes: file encryption, and encryption of
email communications. The situation arises in a commercial setting that
individuals are protecting information which the company would like to be
able to recover in the event of disaster: in the event of the user
forgetting his passphrase, or in the event of the unexpected death of the
employee. Stored files which the company may require the ability to recover
include encrypted files stored in the files system, on backup tapes, or on
floppy disks; and encrypted sent and recieved emails stored in mail client
Security vs Availability
There is a security risk in adding data recovery mechanisms: the additional
risk that recovery procedure is used by other than the owners of the data to
recover plaintext.
A central goal of the CDR design described in this document is to minimise
this security risk. Keys used to encrypt email which is transmitted over the
Internet are more valuable to an attacker than keys used to encrypt stored
files because of the relative ease with which an attacker can obtain copies
of emailed ciphertext. Stored encrypted files in contrast are protected by
all the physical security systems the company is relying on to protect it's
paper files, plaintext data stored on disks, and backup tapes.
For this reason the CDR approach treats communications keys as more
sensitive than keys used to encrypt locally stored information.
Separate Signature and Encryption Keys added in pgp5.0
This section describes a feature added to PGP with the pgp5.0 release:
separate signature and encryption keys. Readers familiar with pgp5.0
functionality may like to skip this section.
pgp2.x RSA keys
pgp2.x (and pgp1.x) only had direct support for one type of public key: the
RSA public key. RSA public keys were used both as signature keys, and as
encryption keys to transfer session keys. The ability to generate RSA keys,
and to interoperate with pgp2.x is retained in pgp5.x.
pgp5.x El Gamal (DH) encryption and DSA signature keys
One reason for the introduction of separate key functionalities is the
addition, starting with pgp5.0, of the DSA digital signature algorithm which
can only function as a signature system. In addition the El Gamal (EG)
public key system which was also added with pgp5.0 is used only as a public
key encryption system. (There are some El Gamal variants which can be used
to produce digital signatures, but these are not used in pgp5.0). (El Gamal
is a Diffie-Hellman (DH) variant which is sometimes also referred to
confusingly as DH.) The DSA is itself a DH signature variant.
Patent issues
Another significant reason for the adoption of EG and DSA in particular is
the freedom from patent encumbrances these algorithms now enjoy. RSA by
contrast is patented, and unpatented algorithms are generally preferred for
internet standards.
Key expiry feature added in pgp5.0
One general security principle is that keys used to protect communications
should be replaced periodically to reduce the value to an attacker of an
individual key.
Migration path
The pgp5.0 standard provides support for this functionality in terms of the
ability to attach expiry dates to signature and encryption keys. (In the
pgp5.0 and pgp5.5 clients the signature and encryption keys are treated as a
pair, and are given the same expiry information, but both the pgp5.0 and
pgp5.5 clients can already cope with signature-only keys and encryption-only
keys with different expiry information.)
Web of Trust
In pgp5.0 with the EG public keys, the Web of Trust (WoT) is based on the
signature keys only. The users signature key is authenticated in the web of
trust. The user signs his own encryption key thereby transferring trust to
it. This ensures that encryption keys can be expired and replaced without
affecting the web of trust.
Limited Perfect Forward Secrecy
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) refers the technique of destroying old
communications keys to ensure that past traffic can not be compromised after
the point of re-keying. One way to use the pgp5.0 key expiry facilities is
to have signature and encryption keys with very different expiry periods.
For example a signature key could be given no expiry period (the pgp5.0
standard supports expiry periods of `forever'), and encryption keys could be
given an expiry period of 6 months.
To obtain PFS, a more secure way of dealing with expired encryption keys is
to actually irretrievably delete them. This then simulates PFS: an attacker
is unable to decrypt traffic encrypted with old communications keys even if
he is able to coerce co-operation from the recipient. No one can be coerced
because the key has been deleted.
It seems reasonable that some users may want to use key expiry for this
purpose, and this does not require any modifications to the existing pgp5.0
Key expiry problems for stored encrypted data
One problem introduced by key expiry is that any stored data encrypted to
the expired key becomes less available. For security reasons the expired key
should ideally be deleted, and in this case access to the data is lost.
Alternatives are to attempt to store the old keys more securely, this then
presents the problem that some stored data is harder to access than other
data, and presents additional key management problems for old keys which
will be confusing for users.
Re-encrypting after key expiry
One method to solve this problem is to re-encrypt all of the encrypted files
at the point of re-keying. However this method has disadvantages in that not
all of the encrypted data may be easily available. Some of the encrypted
data may be on backup tapes, on floppy disks, or stored inside `zip' or
`tar' archives on the disk and hence may be missed.
Separate storage keys
The simplest solution to this problem seems to be to encrypt to a separate
storage key. Within the pgp5.0 standard this storage key would be a separate
El Gamal key with a long expiry date. With this system we then have three
types of keys: signature-only keys, communications-only keys and
storage-only keys. This could require minimal or even no modifications to
the pgp5.0 standard, storage and encryption keys could be differentiated
between by:
   * location storage-only key is stored in (for example a separate keyring)
   * application being configured to use a chosen encryption key as the
     storage-only key by giving a keyID
   * convention on expiry dates (expiry date `forever' could be storage key,
     other values could be communications keys)
   * extra flag to indicate a storage-only key
Once the separation of key types is made, the security benefits of re-keying
can be more fully obtained.
Sent and recieved email folders
To maintain availability after re-keying of encrypted sent and received
emails archived in mail folders, the email plaintext would be encrypted with
the storage-only key. This then means that data availability for encrypted
files on disk, floppy disk, and backup tape is maintained; and that
availability for archived sent and received emails is maintained.
Storage Recovery
If the system is being used in a commercial setting, disaster recovery can
be provided by storing recovery information to allow recovery of the
storage-only key. There is still some additional danger over the case where
there is no recovery procedure: the risk that an attacker may be able to
compromise the recovery information. However because the encrypted data is
all protected by the companies existing physical security mechanisms the
security risk is minimised.
Another form of storage recovery would be to include recovery information
with each file, and this would be a valid combination achieved by placing
CMR-style requests for additional crypto-recipients on the CDR storage-only
key. However this practice makes recovery from forgotten passphrase more
problematic: to restore user access to the data after forgotten passphrase,
the recovery agent would have to decrypt all stored files (be they on hard
disk, backup tape, floppy disk, or stored inside `zip' or other archives),
then the user would have to generate a new storage-only key, and re-encrypt
all of the files. Given the frequency with which users are prone to
forgetting passphrases implementors may decide to avoid this option for
ergonomics reasons.
CDR vs CMR
PGP Inc has an alternative data recovery proposal called Commercial Message
Recovery (CMR). The CMR proposal involves sending recovery information with
the message in the form of a second crypto recipient. In addition mechanisms
are provided in the form of a proposed CMR public key extension to the IETF
OpenPGP standard which indicates a request to the sender to include this
recovery information. In addition facilities are provided in the form of PGP
Inc's SMTP policy enforcer to partially enforce the inclusion of this
recovery information by bouncing mail which does not include it.
Security comparison
PGP Inc's CMR proposal makes re-keying problematic because data is archived
in email folders still encrypted to the encryption key. This tends to
encourage the practice of having very long term communication encryption
keys. Indeed the beta pgp5.0 implementation the author tried makes the
recommendation that most users would give keys an expiry period of
In addition a security risk with the CMR proposal is that an attacker is
able to obtain via coercion, bribery or burglary the CMR key used to encrypt
the traffic for this key. With a purloined CMR recovery key, and given the
long life time encouraged for such keys the previously passive attacker may
be able to recover years worth of old traffic.
Another risk is that companies may for simplicity have only one CMR key,
thereby putting at risk the entire companies secured communications over
periods of years. This is naturally a bad practice, and one which is
discouraged by PGP Inc also, but the author remains cynically confident that
some corporate users will ignore such advice.
Privacy Comparison
PGP Inc proposese the CMR communications recovery mechanism as a privacy
respecting method of achieving data recovery. The privacy features of the
CMR proposal are that there are proposed flags which are attached to a
public key to indicate statement of intent about plaintext handling to the
sender who is about to use the public key.
Three statements of intent are possible with the current CMR proposal:
   * personal key (no flags set)
   * company use key, company may read message, please encrypt to listed
     company CMR recovery key(s) (recovery flag set)
   * company may read message, encrypt to listed CMR recovery key(s) or the
     message will be bounced (strict recovery flag set)
PGP Inc's statement of intent in plaintext handling is a useful concept, in
that it explains explicitly to the sender who will be able to read the
message, and how the plaintext will be handled. Statement of intents are
always advisory, in that they are impossible to enforce; however they are
useful in encouraging ethical behaviour in this regard.
Statement of intent messages are independent of recovery mechanism, and
apply equally to the CDR mechanism described in this document. In fact the
author would like to encourage a fuller set of statement of intent flags for
both sender and recipient, allowing keys to be marked with intents:
   * personal key, messages not archived
   * personal key, messages archived
   * key used for company business, messages not archived
   * key used for company business, messages archived
   * key used for company business, messages archived and recoverable
And, in addition a similar privacy argument could be made to allow the
sender to express his preferences with regard to plaintext handling on a per
message basis. This could generalise the -m function of pgp2.x which
instructs the recipient not to save to a file. (The -m flag is the sort of
electronic version of `please burn this document after reading', this flag
is mildly enforced by the pgp2.x command line application). These set of
flags would allow a sender to send a `normal communication message', or a
`official statement, please archive with recovery if available', or
`sensitive do not archive' and so on. A privacy respecting implementation
could provide support for these functionalities. Whilst obviously easy to
over-ride, this is felt to be a useful exercise in encouraging respect for
In addition the recipient should have ability where company policy allows to
choose which messages to archive, and which to archive with company recovery
equivalent; the statement of intent flags, and the social value of
encouraging companies to respect privacy are useful in both.
Government access to communication key politics
Another aspect of the whole data recovery area is that the US government,
French government, and UK government (as well as other governments) have
expressed an unhealthy interest in obtaining private individuals, and
companies communications keys. Many privacy advocates view this development
with fear, as it seems to many a particularly Orwellian development. Usually
the Government Access to Communication Key (GACK) attempts try to deflect
criticism by focussing on unrelated issues as a vehicle to introducing GACK:
   * Terrorist attacks and requirement for emergency government access to
     communications traffic
   * Government assistance for companies to recover stored plaintext via key
     escrow infrastructure.
   * Assisting electronic commerce by helping put in place Certification
     Authorities and digital signature laws
However readers who have followed GACK politics will recognise the above for
what they are: attempts to put in place GACK via indirect routes
(respectively: the four horsemen of the infocalypse argument (the fallacy
that terrorists will obey laws and use encryption systems which have
government backdoors), the Clipper I, II and III attemps (various attempts
by the US government to bribe and bully companies into building a GACK
architecture), and the UK TTP (Trusted Third Party) proposal where `TTPs'
are a euphamism for a Certification Authority (CA) which has been coerced by
law to keep individuals private keys).
Scenarios governments might shortly try this to request master keys for
communications might be France, where the government is changing from a
position of no encryption software without license, to a position of
unlicensed encryption software being allowed provided that the governments
has a back door into the communications. Other examples being perhaps the UK
(with it's highly controversial TTP licensing proposals), or the US with the
administration and law enforcement community pushing hard for access to
communications keys. It is likely, particularly in the UK, and US in the
authors opinion, that government backdoors would be demanded in carefully
orchestrated stages, designed to minimise public opposition. There might be
trials where the traditionally more regulated financial organisations were
required to comply, next perhaps government funded research labs, and
business organisations accustomed to large amounts of government regulation
Only towards the end would people using government funded networks
(academics), Internet services providers (ISPs) and individuals be
regulated. The final phases may use a terrorist activity, or national
emergency, or other scandal as justification for increasing the
requirements. It is likely also that the justification will be in terms of
wholesome sounding public safety safeguards.
Political Comparison
PGP Inc's CMR proposal loses heavily in the political argument in the
author's opinion because the protocol design supports the practice of
allowing third and fourth party access to communications traffic.
Particularly with the multiple CMR key requests per key which are rumored to
be coming in the next version of PGP, it will be easy technically for a
government to request that one of the recovery keys belong to the
government. Governments already have the political will to have access to
communications; the barriers are technical, and individual's resistance to
the notion. The danger with the CMR proposal is that it could become the
enabling technology for push button suveillance, the enabling technology for
wide scale secret service signals intelligence keyword scanning. This
probably not what it's proposers intend, however the danger is there in
building the technology.
The CDR proposal on the other hand focusses on recovery information of
stored information only, and as a design principle avoids sending recovery
information over open networks. Whislt governments may be interested to
obtain storage keys, they have much less value, because the ciphertext is
much harder to obtain. Also non-compliance is much harder to detect: a
government law enforcement agency would not know if an individual was
actually using storage software with government backdoor key access without
physically obtaining the storage media. For most individuals the point at
which governments executes a dawn raid is a point at which the individual is
already in trouble. The CDR proposal is much closer to the status quo in
political terms.

@_subject: shared keys, proxy encryption (was Re: PGP 5.5 CMR/GAK: a possible solution) 
The CMR feature in pgp5.5 isn't so far intented to cope with this
scenario I think.  That's because pgp5.5 I understand can only
generate keys with one CMR request field.
What you're describing is an alternate use for CMR: to allow
sales at acme.com to have attached to it the request that messages to
that address be encrypted for all the sales people.
Well that seems reasonable in a way.  Still potentially dangerous in
that the NSA will soon enough be asking to be on every one's CMR list.
(As far as I can tell the next version (pgp6.0 or whatever) will
include capability to create keys with multiple CMR requests.  The
capability to handle them is already in pgp5.5 by all accounts.)
The other alternative is as you say: to have group keys which are
shared amongst the sales people.  There are problems with this in
managing the secure distribution of the shared key: sales manager
creates it, and emails securely to all sales team members?
Plausible I suppose.
Problem for both approaches is re-keying: what happens when Fred
leaves the sales team to work for a competitor.  Revoke the shared key
and start over?  Or with the CMR method, revoke just the CMR request
for Fred, and allow key servers to remove CMR requests when presented
with a suitable CMR request revocation cert?  (How often will senders
check key servers for revocation certs?)  Or have short expiries on
encryption-only keys (one per day?), so that they key update happens
soon enough anyway.  (pgp5.x allows for short lived encryption keys
directly because of the separation of signature and encryption keys,
the WoT applies to the signature key).
Really it seems to me that actually having half a dozen sales droids
sharing a key, or being able to decrypt a message because they are all
CMR enforced multiple crypto recipients is a security nightmare either
way :-)
Reckon it would be arguably more secure to have the SMTP policy
enforcer decrypt it for them, even.
Another option would be Matt Blaze's proxy encryption.  That allows
the owner of the sales at acme.com key (perhaps the sales manager) to
create proxy keys which can convert messages addressed to
sales at acme.com into messages addressed to fred at acme.com,
jane at acme.com, and the rest of the sales droids.  (I thought Dave
Wagner came up with an example of a public key proxy function for an
RSA or El Gamal variant or something).
With proxy encryption you still have to have the proxy keys somewhere,
but you could keep them out of Fred's hands by putting them on the
SMTP policy server for it to convert incoming traffic.  This seems to
be more secure than either approach.  And avoids the security risk of
having multiple long term encryption keys used to allow access to
communications traffic.
That way at least messages aren't coming over the wire addressed to
101 people.  And also you don't have to worry so much about quick
propogation of revocation certs.  And when someone leaves you can
remove their proxy key from the SMTP server.
The whole problem is really quite complex, and there are no easy
solutions to group secured mail access where people are leaving and
joining the group at short notice.  Proxy cryptography seems to add
something quite useful to this mix.
Some form of transport level security adds something to the mix also,
because then if you are using CMR keys, or even normal pgp2.x multiple
recipients, or you are using long term encryption keys (as PGP Inc
seems to be currently recommending with pgp5.x (recommended validity
setting of `forever')) at least old traffic isn't directly vulnerable.
Several people commented on using a forward secret TLS between SMTP
servers opportunisitically (if the SMTP server supports the extension,
then use it; if not fall back to current situation).
Even without any authentication, this is a win because the main threat
from government is massive eavesdropping and key word scanning, or
saving of targetted users mails for later key compromise.
Unauthenticated TLS still forces the attacker to use active attacks.
Authentication can be added later as part of IPSEC/IPv6 key
Another method of authenticating TLS is to base the authentication on
the user's PGP WoT.  Include authentication information to the
delivery agent which is capable of TLS, which is also exchanged inside
the encryption envelope.  (Eg. transfer an authentication symmetric
key k1 inside the encryption envelope; send the local TLS capable SMTP
hub / SMTP policy enforcer the key k1.  The TLS forward secret key
negotiation can then be authenticated using this key.  The remote TLS
system can tack the authentication information on to the delivered
message, in a header, or otherwise, and the recipient can check the
I think what PGP are arguing for is ability to recover stored messages
even if they are intended for one recipient only.  As I think has been
established this can be acheived by storage recovery, without exposing
communications traffic to the associated risks.  It is possible that
there is an unstated perceived user requirement, that the messaging
standard be able to allow third party access to the communications
traffic directly.
Your description is another plausible permutation also, I think, which
has it's own merits and security/privacy/political abuse trade-offs.

Super encrypting with a non-CMRed company key is perhaps what you are
thinking, and then encrypting internally to user and CMR key.
This would be a definate improvement over straight forward CMR because
it is effectively a poor-mans Transport Level Security (TLS), and
therefore denies access to the ciphertext (and attached CMR recovery
info) to governments and other intruders.
Still I think better yet not to send recovery information over the

governments to some extent.  Outlawing of `rambo' knives, laws
defining pi = 3, etc., etc.
The question is really what _is_ the CMR path?  PGP Inc are arguing
that it is merely a recovery procedure to recover stored data in event
of disaster (stored emails in mail folders, and files encrypted to
yourself).  However the design seems itself much more suited to
message screening, or message snooping.
I have yet to see any PGP Inc representative admit to the message
screening design motivation.  In fact they have fairly clearly denied
this.  Either you believe that, or you figure they are being careful
not to admit to this.  I don't know what to believe.
The CDR approach ( is more
secure, less politically dangerous, and equally privacy respecting.
Yes, I think it is potentially dangerous.
This is one example of why CMR may be dangerous.  Another is the
danger that we have a couple of years of mass CMR enabled software
deployed.  Tim has been using the acronym GMR, which nicely says what
a well deployed CMR software base can be converted to with an over
night presidential decree.  Lethal.
Again, what _is_ CMR?
I do think companies if they are storing lots of data in encrypted
form will want to assure themselves that they can get it back.  Sort
of like unix/windows NT passwords; if every time users forgot their
password, you had to start over with an empty account, people would
get annoyed.
The problem is that pgp5.x is both an email encryption system and a
file encryption system.  So PGP Inc argue that they need the recovery
features for files.  Well OK, but for emails in transit?  The way to
treat emails in transit is to encrypt with recovery info after
receipt, if the employee feels that particular email is worthy of
saving for company records.

@_subject: PGP, Inc.--What were they thinking? 
Another interesting thing was that the French picked up on it too --
very interesting for them because they are just switching from
crypto-ban to mandatory GAK.  I suspect if PGP Inc could get an export
license they would buy in to it heavily.
(Fabrice Planchon , and Jean-Francois Avon
kindly translated a French document on the web "pgp tows the line" or
something like that I think was the consensus they arrived at on
correct translation of the title of the document).
The indirect other danger is that in going the CMR route, PGP Inc may
be standards setters either through the OpenPGP standard, or outside
of it (in a similar way to the way netscape extensions are supported
by many vendors long before they are part of HTML 3.x or whatever).
If CMR becomes the standard, this greatly simplifies the task of TIS,
or TIS europe, or anyone else in building a much more GAK friendly
product which can interoperate with OpenPGP.  I think I saw a tis.com
address on ietf-open-pgp discussions list and wouldn't be surprised if
they are busy building TIS OpenPGP compliant GAKware right now.
A second indirect danger is that by taking this approach PGP Inc
damages itself by isolating itself from the large cypherpunk and
pro-privacy community, and that an even less friendly crypto email
standard wins by default.  How much protection do we have in S/MIME
vendors.  We were relying on PGP Inc to set the pro-privacy, anti-GAK
line, and then we all would have been behind them in pushing the
OpenPGP standard ahead of other standards because of it's GAK
As it is various cypherpunks are scrambling trying to keep the OpenPGP
standard a CMR free-zone, at least as a temporary measure for this
version of the standard.
As to what PGP Inc were thinking, I'm not sure I understand what they
were thinking ...

"Not required to encrypt to CMR key" but "mail will bounce which

your choice (to avoid phone tap).
And yes you can bypass it, if you're technical, but most people
aren't.  And the bypass can be detected if anyone is checking.
Sounds like a simpler interim solution, if that's what CMR reportedly is?
It's close, but not quite the same.
The major distinction is that Mark wasn't proposing leaving recovery
information sticking out on email traffic going over the Internet in
the form of CMR extra recipients.  (Also Mark wasn't proposing
bouncing mail which didn't meet requirements)
I you have a policy enforcer set to allow all mails through (no strict
setting), then what Mark described does sound similar at first glance,
but there is actually a very significant difference: there is no
message recovery concept: just emails are encrypted to who they're
meant to be sent to.  (In one case the individual, in the other case
the department).
The outer encryption layer I don't think actually adds anything in
this case (other than potentially extra security if the individual's
passphrase is poor).
Given that, couldn't the same be achieved with 0 modifications?  Have
different keys, some shared, some not.

I did understand that even pgp5.0 standard allows multiple CMR keys,
but I thought that the pgp5.5 UI doesn't allow generation of keys with
more than CMR packet per userid... so sounds like we agree?
One thing I never did get clear is: does pgp5.0 know how to reply to
the CMR denoted extra recipients?
Excuse me, yes, I have been tending to talk about the CMR being
attached to the key, while it is actually attached to the userid, of
which there can be many.  I tended to view this as a valid
simplification, because, if I understood correctly, the pgp5.5
business suite allows an administrator to configure the pgp5.5 client
which employees will be using to enforce that there _will_ be a CMR
packet on all userids?  And also most users are likely to have just
one userid.
In other words, I am not denying any of the functionality that it does
have, in being able to be used in privacy respecting ways, but rather
I am describing the most strict settings that the software attempts to
enforce if so configured.  This is still interesting because one
suspects some companies will use it this way, otherwise the
functionality wouldn't have been provided.
It's not that good because even though he loses access to the
computers, if he retains a copy of the private key, he (or the
competitor he has left to join) can fairly easily obtain the
ciphertext of emails.
Proxy encryption is a good solution to this, if it works for the EG
keys you are using.  Or super encryption or TLS to protect the company
internal multiple crypto recipients.  I am not so much against CMR
crypto recipients per se, as I am against allowing these to show
outside the LAN -- too tempting for governments.
It clearly could be more secure in some environments, with crypto
illiterate users who can't remember good passwords, or who have
tendency to write them down.  If they're all sharing keys because
they're all part of the same sales team, and the traffic is fairly low
security, I wouldn't discount it out of hand.
I think that is where we differ ... you focus on privacy principles,
and end up having less security and less resistance to government
The above is merely an ergonomics trade off for some environments.  It
doesn't overly help governments snoop, and can be used where
You can still have individual personal use keys, or any other privacy
respecting architecture.  If we were to argue about how systems could
be abused (either government or company abuse) CMR could be abused
with an enforced CMR key on all company keys, and some software to
read all mail before delivery, and approve all mail on the way out.
CMR could also be potentially be abused by governments in passing laws
saying communications keys must have government as a CMR recipient,
and in being able to enforce this by spot checking emails in transit,
and/or via deputised ISPs with binding cryptography used to allow
untrusted fourth parties to check session keys match.
The enforcement part of it is :-)
Multiple encryption over done with too many long term keys also tends
to be a security risk.  Basing recovery procedures on storage recovery
avoids this trend, and avoids the need to have recovery of
communications keys at all for the defined corporate user requirement.
No, I think you misunderstood the above.
MUA sends X-MTA-authentication only if the MTA is TLS aware, then it
X-MTA-auth: 12345678
the local MTA strips out X-MTA-auth info.  Local MTA does a DH key
exchange with the remote MTA.  Local MTA encrypts with symmetric
cipher (say IDEA or something) the hash of DH parameters and
negotiated DH key with X-MTA-auth key, and puts back in header:
X-MTA-auth: abcd1234abcd1234abcd1324abcd
The receiving MTA leaves that alone, but adds a line telling the MUA
the DH key hash:
X-MTA-key: 567856785678
The MUA hands the X-MTA-auth line to the pgp implementation, together
with the encrypted message.  You have another packet inside the pgp
encryption layer which tells the receiving MUA the sending client's
info... and PGP can check the authenticate the DH key exchange after
the fact.  If there is a MITM you will know about it.
Neat because it doesn't require separate key infrastructure which
always ends up having less meaning to the user being down at the mail
hub level.  And yet you have real interactive perfect forward secrecy.
OK, thanks.  I'll stop speculating on that one then.

Okay!  Some one who is able to say the unpleasant words.  (I think

If this is the case, I reckon it's still better to just escrow their
comms keys locally.  Put them all in the company safe, whatever.  To

presume that sending or receiving super-encrypted messages would would
be a sackable offense.
However, there is an alternate reason for the CMR design, which you
don't include above (tho' you did I think discuss this earlier):
That PGP Inc thought CMR would be easier to implement within their
plugin API, and dual function crypto (file encryption, and email
encryption), and to cope with things like encrypt-to-self on Cc: to
self to keep copies.
Even with snoopware such as you describe, and companies with such
attitudes, there are other similarly easy ways to get data out: user

If you want to get into the debate, at least start making some

"corporate key escrow is better than commercial message recovery"
This is so because CKE requires access to the data.  CMR doesn't, the
recovery info goes over the wire.

PGP has stated that their corporate user requirement is recovery of
stored data.  This can be easily be acheived by escrowing storage
keys, or other stored data recovery methods.  That includes sent and
received email archives.
CMR seems more functionally suited to wire-tapping or corporate
snooping.  PGP denies that this is a design decision.  PGP states that
they want to make a system which is hard for governments to abuse as
the basis of mandatory GAK.
If we accept those denials, the CMR design does not meet it's design
well.  It sends recovery information with the communication, which is
both a bad security practice, and easy for government to abuse.
Please read:
for an example of a storage key recovery design for data recovery
which is more resilient to government abuse.
That study was talking about the design problems in centralised key
escrow.  PGP Inc's design means that these design problems are
bypassed; the CMR design (if/when it gets abused by government to
become a "GMR" design) means that the NSA can publish a GMR master key
on their web page today, and that Clinton can pass the presidential
decree tomorrow.
Some have argued, that you _could_ build a similar system with pgp2.x
using it's multiple recipients feature.  I agree, you could.
However that is no excuse to go and build such a system!  It is much
less dangerous to build CDR systems; much less dangerous to build systems
which are able to recover only data stored on disk.
All that they want is possible with pgp5.5, or will be with pgp6.0,
and backwards compatibility is already in place in 5.5 (and perhaps
5.0, tho' this compatibility seems to be hard to get anyone to clarify).
Another claim is that the CMR system is easy to by pass, and therefore
it is privacy friendly.
I'm not sure this argument amounts to much, because clipper was also
easy to by pass.  Unless you're using steganography, the government
could detect the bypass, and then the GAK system becomes just another
one of those laws that the die-hards break, but which can translate
into 10 years jail time if you get caught, or if the government
decides you need knocking down a peg or two.
I would have thought if any one understood this, it would have been
Phil Zimmermann, after his Federal investigation.
Really, if you are familiar with the clipper design, PGP Inc's CMR is a very
related design, it is almost exactly clipper implemented in software.
The design allows for multiple "message recovery" keys, or it allows for one
single centralised one (belonging to the NSA, if the NSA has their way).
The Blaze et al report you are quoting just says that having a single
central recovery key is an incredible security risk.  It also says that
managing many frequently changing recovery keys centrally is also complex.
The NSA still seemed to think it worth the risk with the clipper design,
because they figured they could keep the key recovery database locked up
well enough to prevent another Ames selling it to the Russians, or whoever.
PGP 5.5 is clipper written in software.  Yes it can be bypassed, yes the
software has privacy options which make the recovery option optional; it
also has installation options to make it non-optional; by passing the
non-optional version can be detected by a corporate or government snoop.

They are right: it can't be built securely.  But that's not what the
NSA et al are saying, they are saying we can build it if you trust us
not to divulge the keys.  Clearly they can.  Also clearly we don't
trust them.  The Ames syndrome dictates that sooner or later someone
will sell the database or government master key.
pgp5.5 or 6.0 when it comes out, are viable for such purposes.  Quite
similar to clipper: all you need is for the NSA to publish a public
key, and for Clinton to pass a presidential decree that all companies
using (the yet to be released) pgp6.0 should add that key to the list
of CMR recipients.
People sticking up for CMR (Lucky, Jon Callas, others) say: but you
can by pass it.  I say so what.  You could by pass clipper too, it
still didn't make it a good idea.  You can be detected when you by
pass it.  With stiff penalties for companies or individuals for by
passing, and the chance of detection, it sounds viable to me.
Why do you think it doesn't meet their demand for real-time access?
pgp5.5 supports multiple CMR fields attached to userids on the key.
So in a company scenario, that would mean that before the presidential
decree, the listed CMR key would be: snoopy at acme.com.  After the
presidential decree, they would have to list two extra crypto
recipients: snoopy at acme.com, and thoughtpolice at nsa.gov.
I think that pgp6.0 (or whatever it will be called) when it is
released will allow keys to have multiple CMR key requests attached to
userids.  This will enable it for real.  (pgp5.5 as far as I can
understand only provides support in the GUI for adding one CMR key
request per userid).  pgp5.5 already supports multiple CMR key
requests per userid in that it knows how to reply to them.

fire-proof safe, on floppies, on the disk, on the disk inside `.zip'
files `.tar' files, on the optical duke box (full of write-once worm
CDs), etc. etc
He forgets his password (for the third time that month).  He needs all
those files back _now_ because there's a deadline, and there's going
to be serious shit flying if it doesn't get finished.
So now what?
The admin has to come along and recover them all for Joe.  He'll be
there for the duration if he's got to re-encrypt half of the 2Gb disk
(it'll be _slow_ with public key crypto, which PGP Inc insists on
using even for single user storage applications, but we'll save up
that rant for another post).  Could easily take an hour or so before
he's through.  Probably he'll miss some because they are inside `.zip'
files, etc.
And then half an hour after the admin has finished Joe Luser will
accidentally delete that important report.  Then the admin gets called
in again because Joe remembered he had another backup of it inside a
zip file, which he can't read because it's encrypted to his old key.
Key recovery would be simpler.  Just encrypt the private half of Joe's
key with the Admins key.  Leave it on Joe's disk, or chuck a copy in
the company safe.  Then when Joe has another memory lapse, the admin
can be done in 5mins.
That means that the company could now read stuff on Joe's disk.  PGP
Inc seems to view this prospect with horror as if it is a privacy
invasion.  But that's what CMR in pgp5.5 used for storage allows too.
I can't see that it makes much difference how the company gets access

@_subject: Saving money 
Absolutely.  I recall trying to explain to someone who was prone to
spending money he didn't have:
- if you spend it before you've got it, you'll get to spend less,
  because of the interest you pay in the mean time
- where as if you spend it some time after you've got it, you'll be able
  to spend more because you will accumulate interest prior to spending.
Most people seem to have bought into the credit concept.  Hire
purchase everything.  Their idea of how much they can afford is how
many hire purchase fee structures fit within their current wages.
Same for houses, and mortgages, their idea of how expensive a house
they can afford is determined by how large a loan the bank is willing
to give them on a 99% mortgate over a 25 year mortgage repayment plan.
Well more fool them.
I have no loans.  I bought my house for cash to rent out as an
investment (the house was cheap because I was a cash buyer and one of
those 99% mortgage types had had it repossed from them by the bank so
I bought it at 25% below market value).  I have been working for 20
months (after finishing higher education).  I have enough wealth to
not work for about 7 years at current expenditure levels.  I am
married, and have two pre-school children.  I have a second hand car
which I bought (for cash obviously) for L2000 (you should have seen
the previous car which cost L300).  I have received no inheritances
worth mentioning.  My income is probably lower than most of our US
friends (UK universities do not pay well).  I expect most of our US
friends will be working when they are 50.  I don't figure on being
forced to work to eat at that age.  My liquid assets are invested in
stocks and high interest accounts.  Their's are locked up in fast
depreciating assets: flash cars, big mortgages, consumer electronics,
and in high consumption life styles: eating out, entertainment, etc.
Their life-style choice, their risk.
There's some kind of parable in the bible about investments (not that
I'm any kind of religious freak... just it is a reasonable story),
some thing about several people being given a gold coin to look after.
One spent it, another burried it in the ground, and another invested
it.  The person who's money it was came back and took the money off
the one who'd burried it in the ground and gave it to the one who'd
invested it.
Socialism has it in reverse, the one who'd spent it would have had the
government steal it from the investor for redistribution to the
financially foolish one.
Spending every penny before you've got it and then looking around for
someone else to pay the bills is a socialist tendency.  The nanny
welfare state.  Legalised theft from those that have worked to those
who have not.
OK, so maybe you can get a run of bad luck, but that bad luck is going
to hit you much worse if you've spent the next two months wages before

@_subject: PGP, Inc.--What were they thinking? 
Could you explain, please.  I took it at face value.  He made other
statements also denying that claim.
I recall your key safe.  I also recall that you suggested cypherpunks
work out ways to do data recovery -- a suggestion which was ignored
because we figure why help them.
There are dangers with each.  The company safe model is better, but
governments could come along and demand a copy of the keys in the
safe, if they are communications keys.
For this reason generally I reckon it's safer to stick only storage
keys in the safe.  Don't back up comms keys.
There are some short-falls to not being able to recover comms keys
(like losing messages which were in transit at time of memory lapse).
So if you do need to recover comms keys, it is I think a good idea to
implement PGP WoT autenticated TLS (I described how to do this in
another post, a reply to one of Jon Callas posts).  This is another
easy thing to do.  A few days hacking at most, everything is in place,
even SMTP agents.
Another thing to do is opportunistic PFS.  Use PFS when you can.  This
just means sending a EG key with each message.  If there is a reply,
the person replying uses the EG key.  The recipient deletes the key
after use.  (EG keys are cheap to generate, if you keep the same
public vales.)  This is good because it allows the company recovery of
comms keys, but denys attackers (industrial espionage, rogue
government agents) access to the ciphertext.
All simple easy things to do.
Don't know which, but I do suspect a concrete example has helped to
clarify thought.  Also CMR is a new development, yes people have
talked about multiple recipients before; but building in MTA support
to reject messages is an additional part of the system.  (Clipper did
something similar rejection of non "recoverable" messages -- the 16
bit checksum with undisclosed checksum algorithm being one other
I'm not sure it's _that_ valid, and heres a few reasons why: pgp5.0
has most of the CMR functionality in it -- this implies that PGP Inc
have been planning the CMR approach for ages.  Also CDR, just
escrowing storage keys, is simple.  Even simpler than CMR and mail
bouncing SMTP agents.
I'm not laughing.
Protecting secrets stored on company machines is I suspect difficult.
This is because the company controls the machines: it owns them, it
probably installed the software, it can install more software when
you're not in the office (eg key board sniffer).
Also a sense of proportionality is useful; balance what can be weakly
enforced by software, against other ways that company NDAs can be
broken (frisbeeing DAT tape out of window), or other ways that
outsiders can send you info which the company wouldn't like (eg like
sending to your home email address).
Always try to be realistic, Kent.
Not quite as much I don't think.  Especially if they had just
implemented storage key escrow.  We've been discussing CKE (Commercial
Key Escrow) being fine and useful for ages, and GACK of messaging keys
being evil.  This is a very old meme.
Would have got some opposition to be sure.  But I really think there
would have been much less fuss.
And pro-privacy seemed to be one of the design principles also.
Unfortunately the net effect is worse than what a privacy and
politically neutral individual would have come up with just security

@_subject: poverty traps (Re: Saving money) 
That is indeed a sad financial state to be in.  I have trouble
believing it though.  Most of the people at low levels of income
around where I live (people collecting pretty reasonable social
security paychecks) spend lots of their money on such things as:
- drinking at pubs and bars (expensive hobby, alcohol is taxed at
  2000% or whatever, and the publican is making a hearty markup too)
- smoking (again expensive hobby, taxed at 2000% or whatever, likely
  to make you die young, but hey, that's their choice)
- have satellite dishes, cars, fancy consumer electronics collections
So if any kids are being deprived of winter clothes or whatever, it's
not because their parents don't have enough money, it's because their
parents are stupid, or selfish.  At least this is the overwhelming
case in a socialist welfare state like the UK.
If you go to a big city (soft-target-ville), you will see a few people
lying in doorways begging, sleeping on the streets; they're doing it
because they want to, or because they are mentally ill, or whatever.
There is no excuse with social handouts of L45 ($72) per week spending
money, plus rent paid.
In the UK we have a "poverty trap".  That is the social security hand
outs are so generous that it would mean a large pay check cut for many
people to go and get a job.  For example, a qualified auto mechanic I
know: for a while he was on the dole: getting L110 spending money,
rent paid, plus fringe benefits (exemption from certain taxations).
He'd have had to be bringing in > L250/week ($400/week) or so to even
make it worth while working once you took into account lost benefits,
and cost of getting to work, and taxation of income etc.  Even then
he'd have been working for an additional hourly rate of about
0.50p/hr.  Yes he'd be self-sufficient, but working for effectively
0.50p/hr isn't much incentive.
More frequently on beer, I think you may find.
In the UK sick mothers get state pensions, sick pay.  Daughters who
have enough wits about them would even get paid by the state to look
after said sick mother.
You don't need total financial independence, all you need is a few
months buffer.
I don't really think that most capitalists are cold-hearted bastards,
charity is fine.  But the state is an ineffient mechanism for
providing social security.  And being forced to hand over `charity' at
the point of a gun isn't appreciated.

@_subject: Orthogonality and Disaster Recovery 
Tim wrote at length about the usefulness of cleanly separating
As this applies to pgp5.x, one could apply this idea in the following
- remove pgp file encryption functionality from pgp5.x
- store decrypted emails in the clear in mail folders
- develop PGPdisk for more platforms, and/or market a separate file
  encryption program which only uses symmetric keys.  Integrate
  recovery into that if required, or let the users figure out to copy
  the symmetric storage only "key ring" onto floppies and place in
  fire proof safe themselves.
Problems with this are:
- pgp5.0, pgp5.5 already have this file encryption function built in
  (they might not want to take it out)
- several people are arguing for the need for the company to be able
  to read queued emails encrypted to a company use key when recipient
  is away on holiday, or leaves company, etc.
- some people argue for functionality of having email archives encrypted
Once you start trying to tackle those problems, things get unavoidably
complicated as you attempt to balance the criteria of resistance to
political abuse, resistance to privacy invasion, security, ergonomics,
and meeting user requirements.
I think it's useful to attempt to design systems which balance those
criteria, even though anything which automates any aspect of third
party access to data is inherently dangerous and more prone to
government abuse.
Kent Crispin said sometime ago that cypherpunks (he addressed the
comment to the list readership) should have a go at designing
commercial data recovery protocols.
Even pgp2.x is not that resistant to government abuse as an email
transport.  Governments can demand copies of private keys, governments
can request to be 2nd crypto recipients.  Some governments sooner or
later may even try that with pgp2.x itself.
So I think it is interesting to encourage use of perfect forward
secrecy, at the transport layer, and opportunistically in the pgp
encryption layer.
It is perhaps dangerous, but if people are doing it anyway, it is
useful to examine politically government resistant company storage
recovery, and integration of this into pgp implementations, and
standards even.  Not something cypherpunks would normally consider,
I'm sure, but the functionality of the deployed base is all important,
as is the functionality of standards -- and both of these are to a
large extent influenced by commercial users.

PGP isn't using ARR (Additional Recipient Requests) for the old RSA
keys either, I don't think -- so I think a copy of pgp5.5 for business
which has been configured by an admin with the strictest settings
would not be able to generate RSA keys.
So the simple way seems to be to not escrow the private components of
the DSA signature key.  If people forget their passphrase, they'll
need to generate a new signature key and get it freshly certified by
the admin while he's recovering their encryption key.
Interesting question even if you are using separate signature keys.
You've got a new signature key.  You want to bind your recovered EG
keys to it.  So I guess you just strip the self-certificates from the
EG keys, and add new ones made by the new signature key.  You can
still decrypt messages, and even pgp5.0 would be able to cope with
that (it'll try to fetch keys to check the certification on the
signature key).

Yes, CMR is to allow companies to recover email in case of employee

@_subject: pgp5.5 = clipper 
There are some remarkable similarities between pgp5.5 and the hugely
unpopular original clipper chip design.  Both encrypt the
communication key so it can be snooped by third parties thus creating
a backdoor.
I suspect that part of the reason there has been less outcry over
pgp5.5 than for clipper is that people have a high regard for PGP Inc,
and allow this to lull their fears -- "if PGP Inc have done it, it
can't be evil."  This is really insidious, and it is reprehensible for
PGP Inc to use their reputation capital to give clipper like systems a
positive spin.
pgp5.5 is basically a software implementation of clipper:
In PGP the backdoor is the second crypto recipient -- the message key
encrypted to the CMRK (Corporate Message Recovery Key) as requested by
the ARR (Additional Recipient Request); in clipper the backdoor is the
LEAF (Law Enforcement Access Field).
Both systems make attempts to enforce the presense of this backdoor
field: PGP Inc's policy enforcer can be configured to bounce mail not
encrypted to the corporate backdoor key; in Clipper it is the checksum
included in the LEAF which allows the receiving chip to reject LEAFs
which have been tampered with.
Both systems are "optional" -- you don't have to use clipper chips,
they will be "voluntary" (or so the politicians claim), and
governments aren't currently using the backdoor feature of pgp5.5, and
PGP Inc argue this won't happen (we'll see how this works out).
Both systems can be bypassed in very analogous ways: They can both be bypassed by super encrypting traffic.
With pgp5.5 the sender can send garbage in the CMRK encrypted field;
with clipper Matt Blaze found you could brute force the checksum and
send garbage in the LEAF field.
Both systems can be improved to make them harder to bypass, something
one suspects may happen if too many people routinely bypass them, and
law enforcement views this as a problem (which they surely will if
their snooping attempts are foiled -- don't forget Freeh is already on

It is easy for the government snoop to detect cheating with either
system -- they attempt to decrypt the traffic, and find the LEAF/CMRK
field is tampered with, or find the contained message is super
encrypted.  One suspects that an additional 5 year sentence will be given to
people who are detected tampering with snoop fields.  (This is not far
fetched I don't think -- already we have heard proposals for 5 year
additional sentencing for "use of encryption in a crime".  If
non-escrowed encryption is outlawed, surely this is the logical next
step on the part of Freeh, and cohorts).
PGP Inc cries: "oh but we have to meet corporate user requirements".
For corporate disaster recovery of stored data?  For corporate message
snooping?  For either requirement many of us have documented far less
dangerous techniques to enable corporate message snooping, and storage
recovery.  Techniques which aren't likely to be adopted by governments
as their snooping architecture.
PGP should fix this quickly before the reputational damage is
increased by more government statements about the usefulness of
pgp5.5. and CMR.

You can build more secure alternatives even for corporate mesage
snooping.  Key escrow is better, or placing proxy keys on the server
to convert a copy of the message to the company snoop key.
One PGP employee explained the perceived user requirement:
Scenario  employee is away from desk (holiday, out of office, off
sick) and mail arrives which is marked URGENT -- what now?
Scenario  employee quits jon in a huff, refuses to divulge
passphrase, lots of queued encrypted email -- what now?
Scenario  employee dies, lots of email queued, what now?
Well some people have argued that it's not a big deal, just get the
sender to re-send encrypted to a different person.
Whatever.  Anyway the argument against CMR is not that it allows
companies to read employees mail when addressed to a company use email
address encrypted to a company use key -- that seems reasonable
enough for some applications. The problem with CMR is that it's a) a security flaw, b) it is open to
abuse by governments.
Scenario  user forgets passphrase
which is arguably the most likely and frequently occuring failure is
badly addressed by PGP Inc with pgp5.5 -- the key is lost.  Their
recovery from this failure is to generate a new key, and have the
company decrypt anything which needs to be read.  This is messy
because encrypted materials can be scattered everywhere (they use the
same key for storage as for email)... on the disk, write once CD
archives, tapes, inside ZIP archive files, etc.  And to do the job
properly all of these need to be decrypted by the corporate recovery
czar and re-encrypted to the users new key.
Simplest solution is simply to have a copy of the users key, or store
a copy on the disk in a form the recovery agent can recover ready for
the user to type in a new passphrase.
You can still have separate personal use keys -- the user forgets the
passphrase for these at his own peril and has his own backup mechanism
(copy written down at home hidden somewhere, or whatever, or simply
not recoverable at all).
And signature keys should not be recoverable -- generate a new one and
have it re-certified.

If the corporate is serious about preventing encrypted messages
leaving their net that they can't read, the simple solution is to
disallow employees from using encryption -- have the enforcer encrypt
Even if you were to use CMR, it is dumb, dumb, dumb, to allow the
snoop key to remain after the message has passed the enforcer -- it
should strip it off on the way out.
Attempting to compress the plaintext helps -- if it won't compress
(much) you get suspicious.
Pointy-Haired-Boss randomness always works -- compresses well and can
encode anything.
Even with enforcer and CMR it's possible to get past it,
super-encryption, garbage in CMRK second recipient field, and
Pointy-Haired-Boss randomness.
Simpler, safer, and more effective to just escrow the employees
company use key -- that ensures there is only one recipient on the
message passing over the internet.
So ultimately prevention largely falls back to controlling what
software people are running inside the building -- no laptops in or
out, no floppies in or out, no installing software, metal detector at
door, body scan, the works.
Detection of sending encrypted mails is easier -- just try to decrypt
everything and have all keys necessary escrowed.  Anything which can't
be read doesn't make it in; anything sent which can't be read results
in a sacked employee.
Companies which aren't after this level of paranoia, but just want to
be able to recover company business mails queued when employee is away

Sounds about a reasonable an outcome as can be expected from a
distortion of market economics such as democracy.  Probably it would
stabilize somewhere below 49% unless methods can be found to extract
enough money from people in jail by having them work.
The real problem as I see it with democracy is that not only do your
neighbours get to vote to have you locked up for something which is
none of their business, and has no conceivable effect up on them; but
they actually get to vote for you to be charged for the "service" of
being locked up to protect you from yourself.
There is a trend of making the "criminal" (the real victim in many
cases) finance his own persecution.
For example we have licensing regimes which are not in our interests,
and you know what, they charge for a license, and they lock people up
for not buying licenses.  And what is really galling is that the poor
sods who get locked up actually fund the process, lose money by being
locked up and pay two or three times for someone elses control
freakish whims.
The wild west was better than this state of affairs -- people didn't
have the energy or inclination to waste their own resources being nosy
parkers, and those that did were apt to wind up full of lead.

Fill out and email me, and I'll tabulate results, and post here and on
mini straw poll on pgp2.x and 5.x usage:
1. What are you currently using for everyday use: 2.x or 5.x
[ 2 or 5 ]
2. What proportion of people you use PGP to communicate with are using 5.x
[ x / y ]
3. How many of the 5.x users you communicate with are cypherpunks
[ z ]
The question has come up on ietf-open-pgp as to how important it is
for the OpenPGP standard to support backwards compatibility with
The tension arises because 2 of the 3 cryptographic algorithms used in
pgp2.x are patented in some parts of the world.  (IDEA being patented
in Europe, and US; and RSA being patented in the US and Canada).
The IETF generally likes to steer clear of patented algorithms as
MUSTs in standards.  This encourages implementations, etc.
(Personally I'm pretty keen on this point, though I would like more
backwards compatible pgp5.x implementations -- I've already received
emails I can't read without resorting to the pgp5 command line app,
which doesn't work with my mailer integrated system.)
So the question arises, just how many pgp2.x users are there.  PGP Inc
are pointing to the ratio of RSA keys to DSA/EG keys on keyservers as
showing that pgp2.x users are in the minority.  However that ratio is
something like 20,000 to 75,000, and I'm sure we've heard statistics
in the past about there being literally millions of pgp 2.x users.
One suspects that either many pgp 2.x users aren't using keyservers (I
know several cypherpunks who have something against key servers and
avoid them for perceived security or privacy reasons), and/or the
pgp2.x user base is exaggerated.

Absolutely.  However it is better where this is possible to decrypt
the message (and optionally re-encrypt the messages to a long-lived
storage key) prior to storing in the mail folder.
I am lead to understand this is relatively easy to do with the plugin
APIs pgp are implementing within.
The advantage of using separate storage encryption keys is that you
can give the communications only encryption keys appropriate expiry
PGP Inc already has this problem with their CMR approach -- when the
user forgets his passphrase there is no backup of the key.  So to
retain data availability they must have the recovery czar decrypt the
lot, and re-encrypt it to the users new key.  Messy.
I'm also not sure that they have automated this for the sorts of plug
environments you are talking about (eg. with monolithic 100Mb
microsoft exchange sent/received mail databases).
Which tends to suggest corporate users who are worried about the
password forgetting problem will copy the private keys on floppies.
This is bad because pgp5.x is not designed for this -- they will get
private signature keys too allowing forgeries.

The original key had read:
So much for NSA security, Jonathan chuckled at the rememberance of
that exploit.
Anyway, for amusement value, and 1.3 MegaWatts of electricity later
(the cowboy had given him a hacked power board account -- phree
electricity, wheee!), Jonathan's industrial grade Hewlett-Packard
deskfab 9GSII fabber had produced a nice matt black suitcase.
Jonathan watched the instructional 3d-mpeg file included on the
hydrocube, and spent a good hour in awe playing with the controls on
the suitcase.  Satiated with knowledge now that he knew how to operate
all of it's modes, he was lying comatose on the sofa wracking his
brains trying to overcome the next hurdle -- how to construct the
perfect way to nuke washington DC.  His plan so far was to spam each
of the `targets' with a word99 macro virus (thanks Bill Gates) in a
document describing his `SFr 10,000,000 campaign contribution' which
automatically spooled a mildly modified "nuke.fab" for fabrication,
and turned off the fabbers status leds through a Hewlett-Packard
firmware bug.  Jonathan had all this down pat.
(The modification to "nuke.fab" in case you were wondering was to put
the suitcase in detonate with no bypass mode, with an initial count
down of 30 seconds).
The problem was -- all those congress-critters were bound to be
running on a PICS fabrication rating below
`national-security-emergency', and so the faba-code verifier would
refuse to load the code.  Worse still the non-hacked HP deskfab models
after mandatory GAF (Goverment Access to Fabbers) was introduced would
narc out the owner to the Feds within minutes, thereby alerting the
dark forces as to what the plan was.
The wall clock now read 3.30am.
Jonathan dozed off to sleep dreaming of glow-in-the-dark
"fifty-eight ... fifty-seven ... " Jonathan woke grogily to see a group of people huddled over a
suitcase.  In the middle of the group was Bubba Rom Dos grandiosely
counting down, in between swigging from his bottle of special reserve
and pressing buttons randomly on the suitcases control panel.
Priscilla and Alexis were peering closely at the pretty flatscreen
status display, making sage comments as to what the buttons might do,
for all the world as if they were playing a video game.
Jonathan came to his senses and screamed at the top of his lungs:
and sprang to his feet.  He almost fell over again as the effect of
moving that quickly so soon after waking up hit him, his head
All heads turned to face him.
"Yaieeeeeeee!" yelled Jonathan, as he rudely barged his way to the
suitcase control pannel, and began franticallly pushing buttons.
After a short panic attack, he calmed down sufficiently to notice that
the display read "no override".  Having absorbed the entire
instruction 3d-mpeg, Jonathan knew what that meant.  The LCD display
read 50 seconds.
Bubba swigged another gulp of his special reserve, and said innocently
"What's the problem?"
Jonathan looked fit to explode, his pulse was racing and his head hurt
horribly, "It's a nuke!" he screamed hoarsely, "and you've just armed
it, and I can't disarm it, and you've got ..." his eyes tore to the
display "45 seconds until you're vapourised."  Priscilla was already
running for the door screaming.
Bubba belched loudly, and looked slightly ill.  Alexis gulped and said
"What now?".
Bubba tosssed the empty bottle of special reserve on to the growing
pile of kipple in the corner, and pulled a fresh bottle from inside
his rain mac.
"Lets think rationally here" said Bubba, calmly, pouring himself a
shot of special reserve, "can't you um disable it, or um, un-fabricate
it or something".
A flash of inspiration hit Jonathan, seeping through his slowly waking
brain (he was not a morning person).
He flashed a grin to Bubba and walloped him hard between the
shoulder-blades shouting, "You're a genius!"  Jonathan then hugged
Alexis lifting her off the ground.
Bubba looked puzzled but pleased.  Alexis looked a little worried.
Jonathan looked at the display pannel on the suitcase "35 seconds".
`No problem' he thought.  He slammed the suitcase shut and practically
threw it in to the HP deskfab 9GSII fabrication bay, and slammed the
door shut.
Then he grabbed the keyboard, and began typing at around 100 wpm.
After a deathly long pause where the terabyte hydro drive light
flickered intermittently, the fab drive hummed to life.  The lights
dimmed with the sudden increase in power consumption.  A few seconds
later the drive light blinked out, and the deskfab fell silent.
"That," said Jonathan, stabbing the screen
-rw-r--r--   1 jon      users   7516192768 Oct  4 10:12 tmp00001.fab
where the words `tmp00001.fab' were emblazoned in green writing on a
black background, "is an armed nuke".
"Now, where was I?" mused Jonathan, and then remembering, rounded on
Bubba, "Uh yeah, just where exactly did you find nuke.fab?"
Bubba made an expansive gesture with his hands, and poured himself
another shot.  Throwing back the shot, Bubba said: "I got it off the
web,", and began searching through the pockets to his rain mac,
eventually pulling a scrumpled scrap of paper from his pocket, and
handing it to Jonathan.  "A kindly elderly gentleman with a 9mm uzi
gave me this address," he explained.  Jonathan looked at the badly
scrumpled scrap of paper, and was just able to make out:
Jonathan looked puzzled, the initials "jya" looked vaguely familiar to
him from his reading of old cypherpunks posts.  Ah, yes, it was that
Architect guy, John Young, who kept getting into trouble over hosting
materials that the feds didn't like.  So he was using the eternity
service now.
Now the panic was over Jonathan resumed his position on the couch,
allowing himself to recover from the previous nights hacking session.
"Say Bubba," Jonathan said with his eyes closed, "do you have any
ideas of how to by-pass the Fabasoft faba-code verifier on an HP
Bubba finished his mouthful of strong spirits, "Huh?  Wassat you say?"
Jonathan explained to Bubba and Alexis the events of the night before
and of the plan to nuke washington DC, and party-way through Priscilla
returned, looking a bit sheepish for deserting them at such a crucial
"So," said Alexis, "You used the deskfab to copy the armed nuke, hence
disabling it?"
"Sure, that's a standard function", said Jonathan, "it's a bit like a
3d photocopier, only you can set it to unfabricate the object being
copied at the same time."
"Well," pressed Alexis, miles ahead of Jonathan, and not needing the
mini-lecture on deskfab functionality, "couldn't you copy a deskfab?"
Jonathan opened his eyes from his inert position on the couch.  "Uh, I
dunno, yeah I suppose so...."
Then Jonathan saw the light, a second time that day: "Heh, yeah,
okay!" he enthused, "that's a cool idea Alexis."
Alexis and Jonathan excitedly started unplugging the deskfab from the
unix box.  "Carry these," said Jonathan and thrust upon Bubba a laptop, the
hydrocube containing tmp00001.fab, and a bundle of interface leads.
Jonathan and Alexis proceeded to lug the desk fab out back, and down
into the basement.  Bubba and Priscilla followed puzzled as to what
the excitement was.
In the basement was an ancient looking Sun unix box.  The screen was
one of those huge glass tube affairs.  Beside it sat what looked like
a refridgerator with clunky looking dials on it.
Jonathan powered up the Sun box.  Suprisingly enough it actually
booted, and 10 minutes later, after an agonisingly slow process where
it went through checking (fscking) all it's ancient hard drives, which
wirred and clicked noisly, it came up, and the prompt said:
Welcome to toad.com
Without hesitation, Jonathan logged in as `gnu', and immediately typed
in a password.  He was in.  Bubba and Priscilla exchanged glances.
Jonathan explained, "I shoulder surfed the password when John logged
in when I was at the physical cypherpunks meet in my grandpas study
all those years ago."
"This," he said patting the minifridge sized machine humming noisily
in front of them, "is his old machine, `toad.com', old home to the
cypherpunks list."
Next Jonathan lugged his deskfab into the refrigerator affair, which
apparently was an antique deskfab, sat the lap top on top of it, and
hooked the laptop up to the deskfab, and inserted the tmp00001.fab
hydrocube into the laptops hyro drive.  Then he wandered off in search
of a portable power source.  He came back lugging an emergency power
module `liberated' from the electric company at some point in the
He hooked-up the power module to the HP deskfab.
"Now," said Jonathan, "the timing on this is a bit delicate", I think
there's only around 20 seconds left on the nuke.
Jonathan set the laptop on time delay to instruct the deskfab to
refabricate the primed nuke with 20 seconds left to pop time, but not
to start doing that for around 1 minute.  Then he slammed the
refrigerator sized fabricator door shut, and began typing in earnest
on toad.com.  The refrigerator started humming, and toad.com's drive
started buzzing frantically.
"Gee I hope the transfer rate on these mechanical drives is good
enough to copy it before it fabricates the nuke", opined Jonathan.
Jonathan started typing again.  "Shit! we're gonna run out of space!"
he said.  And started typing frantically rm -rf'ing anything that
could be rm -rf'ed without stopping the machine.  He rm -rf'ed
half a gig or so spare, and who knows how few seconds to spare.
The refrigerator-sized deskfab stopped humming, and the hum of the
contained HP fabber had stopped too as it had been rudely unfabricated
by the antique fabber.
Jonathan was pleased with himself now.
"That," said Jonathan, with a stabbing motion

which is just about to fabricate a suitcase nuke, which will pop a few
seconds after being fabricated".
"But will it pass the faba-whatsit verifier?" asked Alexis.
"Er are you sure this is a good idea?" asked Priscilla.
"Of course it is," said Bubba.
"That's a good question Alexis," Jonathan said ignoring the other
chatter, "I'm not real sure.  I think it should pass because, well,
the faba-code verifier isn't _that_ smart, right.  I mean to realise
that it will build a HP deskfab, which just happens to have freshly
downloaded instructions to build fissionable material patterned into
it's memory modules, I mean that's like solving the halting problem
Bubba cleared his throat, "If I might make a suggestion here", he
said, "now that the high falutin' theoretical stuff is out of the way,
the obvious thing to do is try it and see."
"A splendid suggestion", said Jonathan, begining to type once more,
"very good Bubba, the empirical hackers approach."
So Jonathan tried it, and saw.  He typed:

@_subject: distributed ratings & repudiable public signatures (was Re: encouraging digital pseudonyms) 
Easier to use pseudonyms would be nice, yes.
Another interesting "service" which really requires client support,
which would improve reading efficiency would be mailing list software
with distributed ratings.  A web based archive with cgi-bins to
accumulate ratings on posts would be feasible for you people who don't
have pay per second.
Then you construct your own matrix of reliance on individual rating
providors (other list readers), and you have probably a pretty good
estimate of your own likely interest in a given post.
Applies to non-anonymous posts too.  Plenty of trash ends up on the
list that hasn't come through a remailer.
We've got two conflicting desires with respect to persistent identity
and proof of authorship.  One desire is that you would like to provide
a verifiable persistent persona whilst remaining anonymous.  The other
desire is to be able to repudiate your signature.  (There might be
some value in having repudiability if you get a RICO conspiracy case
against US cpunks via Jim Bell.)
One tentative technical solution to this situation which I'm not sure
has been discussed before is to actually try this, in a way which
gives some non-repudiability, possibly quite good non-repudiability
for a cypherpunks purpose, but to at the same time arrange that it
would be fairly repudiable in legal terms. So how do we do that?
Well how about we arrange the signature keys, so that a combination of
relatively trusted cypherpunks could forge this public signature if
they colluded.  Say we arrange that all 4 of Lucky, Tim, John Young
and Black Unicorn have to collude to forge a signature.
That would probably be pretty good insurance against forgery for a
public posting purpose for the cypherpunks lists. At the same time if Tim signs his post saying "I bid $800k for that
suitcase nuke", and I post via a remailer an offer signed with my own
key of another $50k, well you-all would probably fairly confident that
I posted this due to the signature, despite forgery possibility.  A
jury would have to however swallow the claim that this signature could
have been forged by the collusion of two Nyms (the caped green one,
and some one known "as black unicorn"), and two crypto anarchist
types, well to them that's probably stretching belief.
(btw the idea of repudiable signatures for private email, where the
signature is constructed so that the recipient could forge it is an
established technique; it will provide the recipient with very good
confidence in the signature, yet it will be one persons word against
anothers if it comes to dispute.  Use remailers to enhance the effect,
otherwise people will be arguing that it's not forged as proved by
mail logs etc)
A general principle with repudiable signatures I think is that to
maximise the pluasibility of a repudiation you should use remailers to
deliver all your publically posted email.  With good tools this would
be no problem to list members, and would look like a real mess I think
to someone trying to prove authorship of disputed documents.

I disagree.
Cypherpunk (freeware) crypto isn't hardly hindered at all by EAR
export nonsense.  You reference Ian Goldberg claiming to have to work on crypto during
trips to Canada.  I think he was just trying to make a political
point.  I submit that he could write and publish all the crypto he
wants in the US (on one of those "export controlled" sites).  It will
get illegally exported in no time at all.  Where's the problem?
William Geiger has PGP on a non-export controlled site, and the export
bods haven't said a word, so it's not even clear that they care about
freeware at this point.
The problem with export controls is for commercial software.
Companies get denied export permission.  Overseas companies probably
wouldn't feel comfortable using non-paid for commercial warez.
Illegally exported commercial crypto warez isn't generally hosted on
ftp/web sites outside the US.  I suspect this has much more to do with
the fact that it is copyrighted, than to do with export regulations.
Netscape, and MSIE browsers are available on web sites, but these are
distributed freely anyway.
Also your claim that the FBI is defeated, and that safe is a good
idea.  Disagree also.
1) SAFE has lots more hurdles to pass before it gets to be law.
2) If it does get to be law, you won't like the modifications that are

We have different export controls.  You can export what you want
electronically right now.  And, so I hear, the exporter is defined as
the person who downloads from your web site, so lots of hits from Iraq
is no problem.  Start to talk about tangible things and you require a
license.  You can get export licenses for strong crypto, 128 bit etc,
just the spooks like to know what's going on, who you're selling to
etc.  I think it probably depends who you're exporting to, etc, etc.
Ie I don't know that the results are publically published, nor reasons
for rejections, etc. so I don't really know how it works out in
Interestingly perhaps all the T-shirts with the .sig on them I have
been exporting to Russia, France, Peru, Brazil, etc. (could someone
from Iraq order one -- that'd be fun) are probably export violations
from the UK too.  I mean it has crypto on it, and it is tangible, and
I haven't asked for permission.  (I'm sure they would grant
permission, but I guess technically I'm supposed to ask them).
Does do.  He wrote a loop back crypto driver for linux.  It's
available on the cypherpunks ftp site at berkeley.  It's also
available at the Italian crypto ftp site.  I was presuming he wrote it
in the US, as his instructions include a for export version with the
crypto chopped out and instructions on how to put it back in.
Anyway, let's see.  Other people write crypto code in the US.  They
set up a revolving directory or some other check.  MPJ had such a
site.  People do this with no legal problems, even Netscape does it
with US government official approval.
So clearly it's not illegal.
Anyway, for freeware crypto, it gets illegally exported (presumably by
third parties) and openly mirrored outside the US.  So where is the
problem that is holding up freeware crypto? Actually there are less direct problems, such as loss of interactive
collaboration from non-US contributors, etc.  But you see my point I
So you're going to export it too?
I think it most likely that it was because it wouldn't have been in

I'd suggest a good target for DNS jamming would be to take out .mil
TLD servers.  Not as if they're doing anything useful, and won't
adversely affect anyone else, whilst it will be a wake up call to the
SIGINT side of the GAK argument that they are jeopardising the

Surely this in itself should be a compelling argument for inclusion of
the SubjectKeyIdentifier?  If it allows conversion of PGP keys into
S/MIME X.509 keys.
On the subject of whether one could get a PGP key to convert into an
X.509 key such that it would function in the X.509 / S/MIME world, I'm
not sure that much can be transferred into the S/MIME world.
I think the public key parameters (actual bigints will transfer.  I am
less confident about certification transferring (third party
signatures and self signatures on public keys).  The reason I am
unsure about this is that what is signed is not codified in ASN.1 in
such a way that it would be ignored as an extension, but still hashed
by an S/MIME implementation to obtain the same hash.  Or perhaps more
that it would cause an S/MIME implementation to complain of a
corrupted certificate, even though the contents could theoretically be
hashed to get the same hash for signature verification.
Or, more specifically, how could a PGP certificate (self signed, or
signed by someone in your web of trust) be transferred into X.509 such
that the message digest of the signed information would be the same.
Where a PGP certificate includes
0       1       CTB for secret-key-encrypted (signed) packet
1       2       16-bit (or maybe 8-bit) length of packet

Of course.
The main research aspect of this project is the joint administration of
such distributed archives. For spam protection, you still need people
who decide, which files are allowed on the distributed server
infrastructure, and which are not. This administration is so far the
weak link in the Eternity Service concept, because whoever decides that
something is not spam takes over some responsibility for the content,
and is therefore subject to legal power of national powers.
The distributed administration in my system will be controlled via a
sort of cryptographically enforced digital constitution (written in a
tiny special purpose functional programming language) that determines
administrative rights in a freely configurable way for a distributed
server architecture (allowing elections, votes, vetoes, impeachment,
updates to the constitution, etc.). This way, no single person will be
responsible for the maintenance of such international software
repositories, but a (usually international) group of democratically
controlled volunteers does this. This way, US people can easily
contribute to the administration of such distributed archives without
having to share any legal responsibility for the fact that the archive
also contains export controlled software, because the majority of
administrators and not some single citizen alone has decided which files
are allowed to use server space.
The goal of this project is of course not primarily to by-pass export
controls. It will hopefully advance the state-of-the-art of how we use
the Internet to distribute information to a point where classical export
control laws and national control of Internet content in general are led
completely ad absurdum, without enabling at the same time the wide
distribution and robust long-term storage of commonly considered
despicable material such as child pornography, instructions for building
weapons of mass destruction, or unwanted commercial advertising. In
fact, by providing easy to configure governmental mechanisms comparable
to those national governments are based on for software repositories, we
distribute the responsibility in a cryptographically enforced way over
the thousands or millions of users of such archives, effectively
bypassing any control of national governments, without the negative
aspects of complete anarchy (spam).
To avoid misunderstandings: the ultimate idea is not to just by-pass
national laws, but to offer a productive and democratic alternative
technical means for controlling online resources, because the classical
options of either national legislation and complete anarchy both have
serious problems.

Wei Dei recently announced (on cypherpunks) his "b-money, a new
protocol for monetary exchange and contract enforcement for
Below is the text of his proposal.
Comments to follow.
I am fascinated by Tim May's crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities
traditionally associated with the word "anarchy", in a crypto-anarchy the
government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and
permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is
impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible
because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical
Until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could
operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants,
and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way
to enforce contracts. Traditionally these services have been provided by
the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal
entities. In this article I describe a protocol by which these services
can be provided to and by untraceable entities.
I will actually describe two protocols. The first one is impractical,
because it makes heavy use of a synchronous and unjammable anonymous
broadcast channel. However it will motivate the second, more practical
protocol. In both cases I will assume the existence of an untraceable
network, where senders and receivers are identified only by digital
pseudonyms (i.e. public keys) and every messages is signed by its sender
and encrypted to its receiver.
In the first protocol, every participant maintains a (seperate) database
of how much money belongs to each pseudonym. These accounts collectively
define the ownership of money, and how these accounts are updated is the
subject of this protocol.
1. The creation of money. Anyone can create money by broadcasting the
solution to a previously unsolved computational problem. The only
conditions are that it must be easy to determine how much computing effort
it took to solve the problem and the solution must otherwise have no
value, either practical or intellectual. The number of monetary units
created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a
standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours
to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3
standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer
on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that
problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.
2. The transfer of money. If Alice (owner of pseudonym K_A) wishes to
transfer X units of money to Bob (owner of pseudonym K_B), she broadcasts
the message "I give X units of money to K_B" signed by K_A. Upon the
broadcast of this message, everyone debits K_A's account by X units and
credits K_B's account by X units, unless this would create a negative
balance in K_A's account in which case the message is ignored.
3. The effecting of contracts. A valid contract must include a maximum
reparation in case of default for each participant party to it. It should
also include a party who will perform arbitration should there be a
dispute. All parties to a contract including the arbitrator must broadcast
their signatures of it before it becomes effective. Upon the broadcast of
the contract and all signatures, every participant debits the account of
each party by the amount of his maximum reparation and credits a special
account identified by a secure hash of the contract by the sum the maximum
reparations. The contract becomes effective if the debits succeed for
every party without producing a negative balance, otherwise the contract
is ignored and the accounts are rolled back. A sample contract might look
like this:
K_A agrees to send K_B the solution to problem P before 0:0:0 1/1/2000.
K_B agrees to pay K_A 100 MU (monetary units) before 0:0:0 1/1/2000. K_C
agrees to perform arbitration in case of dispute. K_A agrees to pay a
maximum of 1000 MU in case of default. K_B agrees to pay a maximum of 200
MU in case of default. K_C agrees to pay a maximum of 500 MU in case of
4. The conclusion of contracts. If a contract concludes without dispute,
each party broadcasts a signed message "The contract with SHA-1 hash H
concludes without reparations." or possibly "The contract with SHA-1 hash
H concludes with the following reparations: ..." Upon the broadcast of all
signatures, every participant credits the account of each party by the
amount of his maximum reparation, removes the contract account, then
credits or debits the account of each party according to the reparation
schedule if there is one.
5. The enforcement of contracts. If the parties to a contract cannot agree
on an appropriate conclusion even with the help of the arbitrator, each
party broadcasts a suggested reparation/fine schedule and any arguments or
evidence in his favor. Each participant makes a determination as to the
actual reparations and/or fines, and modifies his accounts accordingly.
In the second protocol, the accounts of who has how much money are kept by
a subset of the participants (called servers from now on) instead of
everyone. These servers are linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel.
The format of transaction messages broadcasted on this channel remain the
same as in the first protocol, but the affected participants of each
transaction should verify that the message has been received and
successfully processed by a randomly selected subset of the servers.
Since the servers must be trusted to a degree, some mechanism is needed to
keep them honest. Each server is required to deposit a certain amount of
money in a special account to be used as potential fines or rewards for
proof of misconduct. Also, each server must periodically publish and
commit to its current money creation and money ownership databases. Each
participant should verify that his own account balances are correct and
that the sum of the account balances is not greater than the total amount
of money created. This prevents the servers, even in total collusion, from
permanently and costlessly expanding the money supply. New servers can
also use the published databases to synchronize with existing servers.
The protocol proposed in this article allows untraceable pseudonymous
entities to cooperate with each other more efficiently, by providing them
with a medium of exchange and a method of enforcing contracts. The
protocol can probably be made more efficient and secure, but I hope this
is a step toward making crypto-anarchy a practical as well as theoretical

Possibly this is the way you view the filtering service too, though if
this is the case I would suggest use of language such as "filter out"
in place of "delete", as delete suggests that someone or several
someones under a democratic constitution (or any other expressible
voting scheme) are able to prevent others from paying for the
distribution of data of interest only to a minority.
I think a better solution to the problem of an identitifiable
individual being viewed (by governments) as responsible for the
existance of a document is anonymity.  That way, the factions of the
US government interested in controlling bit-flow don't know who
submitted the document, nor who voted with hard ecash to keep it
I don't think this is possible, or advisable even.  Cash is a better
metric of interest in data, trying to think in other terms just means
someone else will make the money.  John Gilmore's quote in monetary
The question is whether one believes in unconditional free speech or
I suggest that those who believe in conditional free speech would be
wrong if their belief led them to try to deprive others of
unconditional free speech rather than setting up and subscribing along
other like-minded types to filtering services.
The muslims in the example above may view images of females showing
their faces as extreme heresy, worthy of the death penalty.  One has
to accomodate differing views of what is acceptable.  There is no
world view on what is acceptable, therefore I propose that a better
solution is to consider filtering.  The existance of data does not
hurt people.  People who object to the availability of data are
advocating the creation of `thought crime'.
Filtering and rating services can provide an effective method of
avoiding reading data one is uninterested in.  If someone else is
interested enough in the availability of data to pay ecash to ensure
it's availability why would anyone else be interested to prevent this.
In a straight-forward translation of the voting scheme to monetary
voting, we might if we were not careful result in a system where
others (censors) are able to cast negative monetary votes by paying
servers not to distribute certain bit strings.  I think an eternity
system should view this as a cryptographic attack to be designed
around.  Design the system so that the server can not be bribed to not
distribute certain data by dint of not being able to recognise it.

@_subject: (eternity) cost metrics 
The alternatives, such as say one vote per person have problems too.
Perhaps one person cares greatly about the issue and spends the one
vote posting pro-X information (for some issue X), and the other
person hardly cares at all, but has some slight bias against issue X
so spends one vote posting anti-X information.  Now we have ignored
this difference in scale.
Cash allows you to measure the scale.
Perhaps an in-between voting metric might be percentage of individuals
wealth.  But then this also is unfair because a pennyless dole sponger
could dump 50% of his wealth on an issue on a whim, and the person who
has mega bucks may have worked hard to have the money to help
disseminate information about some issue Y he believes passionately
So straight cash seems I think to be a good metric.
Note also my earlier comment that I view an important eternity
objective to be preventing negative votes on data availability.  You
can only disseminate more, say contradictory, information not remove
information.  You can attempt to disseminate more copies (make
available with higher redundancy, and fund faster download) perhaps,
but this does not drown out the other information.
Filtering and rating services should ensure that just because there
are a lot of copies of naff software my mega-corp M out there, it
won't in anyway reduce your access to quality open source software,
nor slow you down in finding it neatly cataloged by use by your
quality open source software rating service.
If you worry that mega-corp M will buy all available space at a
premium, there is an easy solution: if mega-corporation M decides to
flood eternity space with their inferior software, one can combat them
by getting into the eternity servers business, taking their money and
using the profits to disseminate quality open source software, or
simply to profit from their gullibility.
As long as people are interested to keep the data around in low
priority low access speed storage they will pay for this to happen.
If they don't care -- well they don't care.  People who do care can
fund it, and evangelize to others on the merits of doing this.  No one
has any special right to force others to pay for keeping junk around
for the sheer historical sake of completeness of it.

@_subject: Wei Dei's "b-money" protocol 
Some discussion of the properties of Wei's b-money protocol.
b-money seems to be book entry ecash system related to hashcash, where
the "book" is open, and distributed.  Anonymity is derived from the
fact that the participants can be pseudonymous.  hashcash would be a
candidate function for Wei's decentralised minting idea: to create
value you burn CPU time, just like with hashcash, but Wei's
distributed open book entry system allows you to psuedonymously
exchange value.
Problems are (1) inflation, (2) borrowing resources, (3) linkability
of transactions, (4) b-money has a big bulk discount, (5) getting
money in and (6) out, (7) resource waste.
(1) Inflation -- the cost of hardware to compute a given collision
falls in line with Moores law.  Perhaps one could get around this by
defining a b-money unit to require more computational effort over
time.  Say define 1 b-money unit to be the computational effort of 1
months compute on the most efficient hardware that can be bought for
$1000 at current prices and state of hardware.
(2) Borrowing resources -- a student with access to a campus full of
workstations can obtain quite a bit of free CPU time.
(3) Linkability -- although the participants are anonymous, their
transactions are linkable and so participants are pseudonymous in
b-money (linkable anonymity being pseudonymity).  This is inherent
because of the need to broadcast transactions to ensure the open book
entry is updated.
(4) You can get money in -- by buying hardware -- but it will cost
different people different amounts.  If I am using an existing general
purpose workstation my units will cost more than if I buy custom
hardware.  Not so bad a problem, just view this as an economy of
scale, or a bulk discount.
(5) Getting money in by buying hardware works, but people don't want
the inconvenience of buying custom hardware, they would rather just
buy b-money for force-monopoly backed money (national currencies).  If
we setup a mint which made it it's business to buy up-to-date custom
hardware it would be difficult to buy b-money anonymously because the
pseudonym would reveal his identity by the use of traceable payment
systems (credit card, cheque, wire transfer, etc).
(6) Getting money out is difficult also.  The pseudonymous b-money
user would find it difficult to obtain force-monopoly money without
revealing his identity.
(7) If such a system took off there seems to be an overhead equivalent
to the value of b-money in circulation which over time has essentially
been burnt off in disipated heat, and useless hardware.  But probably
the cost is still much lower than the enormous costs involved in
maintaining a force monopoly to enforce traceable transactions.
Some thoughts on ways to improve on some of these areas:
To improve the problems of pseudonym identity leakage in (5) (paying
for b-money) perhaps we could formulate a blinded cost function rather
than my suggestion of hashcash.  In this way one could easily purchase
hashcash.  One approach to achieving this would be to have an ordinary
ecash mint using chaumian blinding but somehow be able to audit that
the mint is producing hashcash tokens to match each ecash withdrawl.
Then we would have an blind ecash mint backed in hashcash.  The
purchasing pseudonym unblinds the token and broadcasts it.  Servers
check that it has not been seen before, and increase the pseudonym's
balance by it's value.
Periodically the hashcash mint has to publish it's hashcash to prove
that it is not cheating.
It may be that you could find a blind cost function which achieves
both blinding and some cost function at the same time, to skip the
stage of the mint publishing associated hashcash.

Listened to an analyst on the radio expressing view that towards 2010
China will be leading world economic power.
Anyway interesting was that the analyst expressed that in her view
China was keen to avoid the mistakes of the socialist welfare state as
market liberalization and prosperity grew.  She considered the burden
of a welfare state to be a large burden which would mean that
China would outstrip growth in the west.
Also she stated that she thought democracy was in decline.  When
interviewed asked about human rights, she opined that these would
improve as the market became freer.  She stated that China hopes to
bypass democracy going straight to free market.
China may be interesting in a few more decades...

@_subject: time to learn chinese? 
The interesting aspect of her speculation was on the possibility of an
economic and political process of change which would result in a
transition directly from communism to a free market based political
system, by-passing democracy and socialism.  She viewed democracy and
socialism as mistakes made by the west to be learned from and avoided.
Communist regimes typically include a significant element of central
planning which introduces economic inefficiencies, yes, and loss of
freedom of choice, etc.
Socialist democracies have much in common with communist regimes in
this respect: elements of centralised control, restrictions of choices
(the nanny state, huge welfare systems, 50%+ taxation) large
government restrictions on free market operation.
Both systems suck, but currently the lesser of two evils by a large
margin is living in a socialist democracy because of the wider
freedoms as compared to the lack of freedoms in Communist countries
such as China, and because of it being worth putting up with the nanny
state and 50%+ tax rates as compared to the economic instability and
organised crime problems in Russia, and previous Russian provinces now
split off back in to small countries.
The interesting question is the how these two evolving political and
economic systems will change over time.
Her speculation was that a previously communist system evolving
towards becoming a pure market system might move towards this goal
more rapidly than a rampantly socialist democracy would move towards
the same.  She also considered the different cultural work ethic
signficant: Chinese people on the whole work harder, and re-invest
more of per capita income.
Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan produce sizeable quantities of electronic
devices, consumer electronics items, cars, etc.  In fact I understood
them to out compete western manufacturing in many instances.
They may not always be at the leading edge of R&D, but they do produce
a lot, much of it quality equipment, and we (westerners) buy more
consumer electronics, and cars produced by such countries now.
Personally I would buy a Toyota over a Ford anyday :-)
China might be viewed as larger version of Singapore a few decades ago
perhaps.  Enterprise zones (or same rules for the whole country) with
0% taxation, unrestrictive planning rules etc should help attract
outside investment from high tech companies, if political stability
was viewed as good enough.
Probably you are right on the optimism of the time scales of the
interviewed analyst.

In an interesting discussion on software tempest measures,
People who are interested in communications and data security to the

information leaks and tempest shielding.
Perhaps similar justification can be used for the relevance of tempest
research -- it is just the hardware half of assuring confidentiality
of information.  There should be a reasonably large supply of
commercial funding candidates even given the 90 : 10 ratio of business
interest in availability over confidentiality.
Personally I view technology to assist copyright piracy a more
interesting research goal!  Candidate technologies include high
bandwidth eternity services, anonymous remailers with sufficient
bandwidth, pipenets, DC-nets, free software movements, countries
with modern intellectual ownership rules like Argentina*, and undermining the power of the state so that state provided copyright

whatever to skip the test.
Also as William notes, don't use the crap -- it's only 64 bits anyway

@_subject: brute forcing combination locks (Re: Bruce Schneier, Sandia, FBI and the REAL WORLD) 
When I was at [x] they had (and still do I think, hence obscuring
name!) 0-9 digit key pad combination locks.  I noticed by just
casually using various permutations each time I used the locks that
there was something anomalous about the way the key pads worked.  If
the code was 6789 you could get in by typing 56789, or by typing
456789 etc.
Clearly this gives you almost a 4 x reduction in the search space.
So I hacked up some code to compute the minimal universal door entry
sequence number.  Joy of joys the "universal code" as it was dubbed
fitted easily on 1/2 a sheet of A4 paper at 66 lines by 80 characters
per line, and we figured (myself and entertained colleagues) with
semi-covert experimentation that with a bit of practice you could
break a lock in around 10 mins manually or something like that.  It
looked quite esthetically pleasing also.
The sequence looked something like this:
which would try combinations in this sequence:
I was not able to do it quite the theoretical minimal number of
permutations of 2503, but it was only 3 or 4 extra digits I think.  I
am not sure if you could do better than this, but it was a
computational trade off, my algorithm was recursive, and back tracked
as it was; I just chopped it off and demanded best solution after 1
hours CPU or whatever.
I might have the universal code and source code around somewhere,
can't lay my hands on it right now.
We dubbed this sheet of paper the "universal door code", and
considered pinning it beside the lock :-)
These locks looked pretty cheap, and didn't suffer the mechanical
failure problem you describe, we probably gave them enough stress
testing in our semi-covert experiments.
Also it occurs to me that a duty cycle of 10k operations isn't that
high.  I am left wondering if perhaps you were pushing the units too
hard -- would you have been able to break the lock before mechanical
failure if you had slowed the rotation rate of your mechanical dial
turner?  Also, perhaps your mechanical setup was too rough, putting
abnormal strain through clunky motion or something?
Also, in fact these 0-9 digit 4 digit locks at [x] I think had other
problems also, under certain circumstances you were able to type a
spurious digit between the digits of the 4 digit code (eg code is
1234, typing 15234 would let you in!)  If we had been able to find a
rule governing this behaviour, an even shorter universal code would
have been obtainable.  However it seemed erratic, and interest waned
around this point somewhere.
They also had a few hex versions with 0-9A-F and 4 digits, which I
also calculated a universal code for.  They seemed not vulnerable to
the spurious digit flaw described in the above paragraph of the 0-9

@_subject: (eternity) mailing list and activity 
[I've Cc'ed this to cypherpunks from discussion on eternity at internexus.net]
Firstly note that there are 3 (three) systems going by the name of
eternity service at present.  Ross Anderson coined the term, and his
paper which describes his eternity service, you should be able to find
somewhere on:
Next, my eternity prototype which I put a bit of time into hammering
out last year in perl, borrows Ross's name of "eternity service", but
differs in design, simplifying the design by using USENET as the
distributed database / distribution mechanism rather than constructing
one with purpose designed protocols:
And there is Ryan Lackey's Eternity DDS (where DDS stands for I
presume Distributed Data Store?).  I am not sure of the details of his
design beyond that he is building a market for CPU and disk space, and
building on top of a an existing database to create a distributed data
base accessible as a virtual web space (amongst other `views').  He
gave this URL in his post earlier today:
To answer your question as applied to my eternity design, I will
describe how virtual domains are handled in my eternity server design
which is based on USENET as a distributed distribution medium.  A
proto-type implementation, and several operational servers are pointed
to at:
In this design the virtual eternity domains are not based on DNS.
They are based on hash functions.
Really because it is a new mechanism for accessing information URLs
should perhaps have the form:
Where a separate distributed domain name lookup database is defined,
and a distributed service is utilised to host the document space.
However because it is more difficult to update browsers to cope with
new services (as far as I know, if anyone knows otherwise, I'd like
pointers on how to do this), I have represented URLs of this form
This would enable you to implement a local, or remote proxy which
fetched eternity web pages, because you can (with netscape at least)
direct proxying on a per domain basis.  Using the non-existant top
level domain .eternity, you can therefore redirect all traffic for
that `domain' to a local (or remote) proxy which implements the
distributed database lookup based on URL, and have normal web access
continue to function.
My current implementation is based on CGI binaries, so does not work
directly as an eternity proxy.  Rather lookups are of the form:
The virtual eternity URLs (URLs of the form  are
converted into database index values internally by computing the SHA1
hash the URL, for example:
SHA1(  ) = d7fa999054ba70e1ed28665938299061b519a4f7
The database is USENET news, and a distributed archive of it; the
database index is stored in the Subject field of the news post.
The implementation optionally keeps a cache of news articles indexed
by this value on eternity servers.  If the required article is not in
the cache it is searched for in the news spool.
Currently this is where it stops, so articles would have to be
reposted periodically to remain available if articles are either not
being cached, or are flushed from the cache.
However the cache is never flushed, because the cache replacement
policy is not currently implemented.
An improvement over this would be to add a random cache flushing
policy and have servers serve the contents of their cache to each
other forming a distributed USENET news article cache.
Another option would be to search public access USENET archives such
as dejanews.com for the requested article.
The problem is really that we would prefer not to keep archives of
articles directly on an open access server, because the server's disks
could be seized, and the operator could be held liable for the
presence of controversial materials.
Wei Dai suggested that documents should be secret split in a redundant
fashion so that say 2 of 5 shares are required to reconstruct the
document.  If the shares are distributed across different servers,
this ensures that one server does not directly hold the information.
Ross describes ideas on how to ensure that a server would not know
what shares it is holding in his paper which can be found on his web
pages, the url being linked from:

I think child porn is pretty much the canonical example -- the spooks
available to seize.  (eg The Amateur Action BBS case which Tim cites

but a US postal inspector mailed some to them, and busted them for it

An article which got forwarded to cypherpunks a while back was a URL
for some people who had created a for-pay web service which consisted
soley of hypertext links to child porn articles in usenet.  I never
did investigate (the worry is always that it is a sting in itself, and
I was interested in the techniques not the material), but it is
interesting that these people considered this action safe enough for
the monetary rewards to compensate.  (Anyone save this post / URL, or know if these people are still in
business, or what technique they used to be able to generally link to
USENET articles... is it possible to link to
news:alt.anonymous.messages/message-id in a way which is independent
of news spool?)
I agree with Tim that actually building distributed file systems where
data can be traced back to the server serving it will cause problems
for the operators.  I think even if there are many operators, and even
if the data is secret split, the operators would likely be held
Ross's paper describes some techniques for building a distributed
database which makes it difficult for a server to discover what it is
serving.  (Necessary because an attacker will become a server operator
if this helps him).
The threat of seizure is the reason that I focussed on using USENET as
a distributed distribution mechanism.  All sorts of yucky stuff gets

So I focussed on USENET, but the weakness of using USENET for building
a distributed database where data is intended to persist for
protracted periods of time is that USENET articles expire, existing in
news spools often for only 3 days or so.  The problem is really that
USENET is essentially a distributed _distribution_ mechanism, and not
a distributed database.
Archiving USENET as a separable enterprise which charges for access
(altavista for example charges via advertisements) seems less
problematic than directly trying to build a database of controversial
materials.  Archiving it all partly reduces your liability I think,
because you are not being selective, you just happen to have a
business which archives USENET.  However there are two problems with
this: a) volume -- USENET daily volume is huge; b) the censors will
ask you to remove articles they object to from the archive.
The solution I am using is to keep reposting articles via remailers.
Have agents which you pay to repost.  This presents the illusion of
persistance, because the eternity server will fetch the most recent
version currently available in the news spool.  This avoids
centralised servers which would become subject to attack, all that is
left is a local proxy version of an eternity server which reads news
from an ordinary news spool.
My current implementation is a CGI binary which is currently running
as a remote eternity server.  You can run it as a local eternity
server if you have a local UNIX box, running say linux.
Better would be a more general local proxy for other platforms.  I am
working on this local proxy version at present.  This is the state of
play for me.
The reposter will be either the publisher of the article, or a
reposting agent.  In either case remailers can be used.
Remailer resistance to attack has improved a lot since some of the
remailers started using disposable hotmail etc accounts as exit nodes

@_subject: autonomous agents 
A canonical way to do implement things like remailers, eternity
servers etc. is to build a distributed computation system to allow
autonomous agents to be distributed across the internet.  Create a
market for CPU resources, bandwidth and disk-space so that the agent
can pay it's way.  Charge per CPU/hour, Mbit comms at given data rates
and Mbyte/year storage, base it on Java as a portable network based
language with code distribution support.  Then let people fire off
what ever they like, so long as they are paying.
In this environment an eternity variant, or remailers, or anything
else becomes a collection of autonomous agents which must fund their
own distribution.  The autonomous agents could send back profits to
their creators, or use the profits to self propagate.
Someone who thought up a good application, and got the economics right
for their bot's buy and sell algorithms might become rich, even.
I had considered that a generic perl execution system charging for
resources would be useful for remailers a few years back.  Java seems
pretty good for this purpose also, being another portable network
aware language.
The question is though would you let a bot of this sort loose on your
For agents to be able to achieve anything useful, the Java sandbox
model has to be relaxed to allow the agent to make network connections
to other than the machine the code was served from.  Java has support
for this in that signed applications are allowed to make external
network connections.
The problem is the flexibility would allow an autonomous agent to pay
it's way in say breaking into a series of machines, and sending back
obtained documents via remailer to the operator.  A well funded
attacker could cause lots of problems for operators.
However the system as a whole is nice for our `creating lawful
excuses' drive, because there are many applications which could make
good use of the distributed computation system: filmatic quality image
rendering computations, scientific computations, code breaking
efforts, distributed web server applications. The liability questions are interesting also.  If the participant in
the CPU resource market is not expected to be able to vet all source
code he runs, this gives the would be eternity operator a chance to
distribute his risk.  If the system becomes widely used, this helps
protect it from attack.

One tactic which could protect a USENET newsgroup operator from child

   to reconstruct.
3) steganographically encode the eternity traffic.  Pornographic images

   the eternity document and hide it inside the image file posted)

leading to actual machines serving materials.
We can probably arrange that these servers do not know what they are
serving, however if the whole protocol is setup specifically for the
purpose of building an eternity service, it will be shut down.

Ah, not if you are talking about my eternity prototype, because it only works on the unix platform.  Same for Ryan at present I think.
The overloading of "eternity service" is not helping here.
My point was that talking about my eternity prototype using USENET as
a distribution medium, where the `eternity server' is just a
convenient way to present an apparently persistent view of transient
USENET articles, using a local eternity server reduces the risk of
traffic analysis attack.  Now all you are doing is reading news.  If
you already have a full USENET feed, you have no new externally
observable traffic.
This process would be better termed a `local eternity proxy', in that
it would effectively be acting as a local web proxy process, where the
eternity virtual web pages were being fetched from a local news spool
by the local web proxy.

your posts so that only N of M are required to reconstruct.  If you
get shouted at for SPAM, steganographically encode the eternity
traffic.  Pornographic images in alt.binaries.* would be suitable
because there are lots of those already.  Because this is a publically
readable message an attacker (such as Ryan's system admin he mentioned

decoding, and purge it from the news feed.  We can counter this move
by encrypting the original posting, and posting the decryption key a

The surest way is to run the eternity server for yourself only.  The
distribution medium is massively distributed, as the distribution
medium is USENET.  USENET is a broadcast medium.  Possibly the most
secure way to create one way anonymous communications is to broadcast
the messages.  Tim May's BlackNet uses this approach.  Eternity is
doing the same thing.

@_subject: mirroring services, web accounts for ecash 
Some meta-level thoughts on the eternity service document availability
Many of the problems with designing an eternity service are introduced
by trying to build real time accessibility of data (with similar
response times for documents to those offered by web servers).
The BlackNet model can quite ably provide eternity like services with
perhaps 24 hour turn around on documents.  Everything is operated by
digital dead drop (via say news:alt.anonymous.messages), or mixmaster
This suggests that another approach would be to have two classes of
services.  Users of high risk documents can put up with 24 hour turn
around, and lower risk documents can be served by an alternate
service, intermediate risk documents can exist by using low risk
resources until detection.
The low risk document service could be just an automated mirroring
service, and could for example explicitly state that illegal materials
in server localities will be removed on the server operator becoming
aware of this fact, or perhaps on receipt of court notification.  This
presents the kind of "we aim to discourage illegal materials" persona
that commercial ISPs like to present to the police and spooks.
It might also be useful to partially automate the differences in types
of material which can be hosted in various jurisdictions.
Scandinavian countries might be used for pornography in the 14 - 21
year old range; other jurisdictions useful for copyright music
materials, where music royalties are collected by a blank media tax;
the US might be useful for publication of materials critical of
Islamic beliefs, and so on, in each case the materials being strictly
legal in the server locality.
The mirroring service could be offered by mirror site operators as a
public service for locally controversial materials, or services could
be charged for to improve long term availability.
If the mirroring service is automated, it is likely that materials
will slip through the gaps in the system (especially if it is designed
with this property in mind), much like warez used to be traded in
funny named directories on badly configured ftp servers, or world read
and writeable ftp incoming directories.
The operator says "darn warez pirates" and removes the offending warez
when he is notified.  But it might stay up for a few weeks, and URLs
spread quickly, and there are lots of open access sites.
Another less controversial "host" service which warez pirates might be
likely to get away with abusing would be simple web space available
for ecash.  Lance Cottrell already offers this such anonymous web
accounts.  If many ISPs start offering this kind of service, the
pirates will be more easily able to keep going by hopping from account
to account, as accounts are closed for breach of policy, in a similar
way that spammers treat accounts as disposable.
A TAZ server could even offer a persistent virtual URL to a migrating
warez file collection located either on mirroring sites, or on
anonymous ecash paid web accounts.  (TAZ servers just offer a layer of
indirection, see Ian Goldberg and Dave Wagner's paper:

@_subject: metrics of eternity service properties 
Yes.  I think my eternity service in USENET is actually fairly
resistant to attackers determining readers and publishers.  The
limiting factor is the bandwidth consumed.  We have to keep below some
threshold otherwise news admins may attempt to filter out eternity
articles; and there is some limit at which the system would break down
One suspects posting more than around 10Mb-20Mb / day would be enough
to motivate administrators to start filtering.  Some people with
questionable motivation also have made something of a sport of sending
forged cancel messages, and these people will be more easily
motivated, as as far as I can tell their motivation is a perverse
enjoyment of censorship, and sense of self importance, and of malice
in perpetrating DoS attacks.
Actually I was aiming for seconds access time with "Eternity USENET".
(I am going to dub it "Eternity USENET" -- just any name -- because
the lack of names to denote the services under discussion is becoming
However the reason I am able to claim seconds is because I aim to keep
the data either in the newspool, or in a local copy of recent messages.
The design is similar to TELETEXT, the text mode information services
hosted as side bands on TV signals.
The basic topology is the same: we have a broadcast medium, data is
slowly re-broadcast.  So my design is fairly analogous to a FAST-TEXT
system, which keeps a copy of all the pages, and updates them as the
TEXT signal sweeps past.
So metrics we could use to describe the functionality of an eternity
design should include "update time", and "access time".  I'll try a
quick table of this to illustrate my understanding of Eternity
BlackNet (BlackNet used to host an Eternity like service), and
Eternity DDS as compared to Eternity USENET.
                            E-BlackNet     E-USENET       E-DDS

ease of deployment          easy           easy           hard
Clearly these figures are order of magnitude only, if even that
My reasoning is as follows:
Eternity BlackNet:
I am presuming we have third party BlackNet operators who offer to buy
and sell information, acting as distribution agents.  It takes around
a day to send requests or submissions to the operator via a dead drop
(encrypted material posted to USENET via remailer).
If requested information is sent to clients via replyable nyms
bandwidth efficiency is improved.  If information is sent to clients
via dead drops efficiency drops because the information is broadcast
for each request.
Clearly a user could, if he wished to improve his access time for
browsing BlackNet eternity documents, replicate the entire BlackNet
database locally.  (Or perhaps subsets defined as all documents by a
chosen set of authors, or all documents with given keywords, or with a
given third party rating etc).
This involves re-posting documents periodically to USENET, and relying
on the small data set size to ensure that local eternity proxies can
retain a current copy of the dataset.
Variants on this approach can migrate towards E-DDS approach by using
publically accessible E-USENET servers, and by E-USENET server caches
sharing their then larger document store.  Also by adding other
submission mechanisms to the pool formed by the set of publically
accessible E-USENET services.
Economic incentives are used to encourage people to take risks in
hosting controversial documents.  Indirection is used to have a hidden
set of data servers, which are only accessed via publically known
gateways.  (I would recommend looking at Ian Goldberg and David
Wagner's TAZ server, the url for which I posted in an earlier post,
for this indirection function).
I am unsure how an attacker would be prevented from discovering the
hidden set of data servers.  How do we exclude the attacker from
becoming a gateway server?
I get the impression that the idea also is make the service a
commercial success as a distributed web hosting system, and to get
away with comparitively small amounts of controversial materials which
migrate.  This idea is a useful model I think.
Comments?  Clarifications, Ryan?

For unmoderated groups, we have a much easier task: that of avoiding

a given time.  Binary data is obviously much easier to hide data in,

next generation web proxy cacheing and mirroring scheme, dynamically

service rate they desired.  A market in web data would then give web

Web caches already have some protection from various laws.
One other idea for an eternity service host we could leach off was

was that it would be nice if we could con proxy caches into cacheing
eternity web space for us.

@_subject: (eternity) Automating BlackNet Services 
This design ties in pretty well with what I understood Tim May's
suggestion to be of using BlackNet to provide eternity services.
I notice that you are assuming that all document delivery would be via
digital dead-drop (alt.anonymous.messages).
Depending on the usage pattern of this service it has the potential to
be higher bandwidth than by Eternity USENET design.  The BlackNet with
dead-drop only scheme you propose will become more expensive in
bandwidth than Eternity USENET at the point at which the volume of
satisfied document requests being posted to USENET for different
recipients exceeds the volume required to repost the traffic at the
desired update rate.  This is because you may have multiple requests
for the same document, all of which must be posted to
One thing you could do to reduce this overhead would be to combine
requests for the same document.  To do this you could add an extra
delay to satisfying requests to increase the chances of accumulating
more requests for the same document.  Alternatively, documents which
were sent out within the last 24 hours or so could have just the bulk
symmetric key encrypted for the subsequent recipients sent together
with a message-id.  (A separated multiple crypto recipient block).
A more subtle problem you would probably want to address with this
design is that you don't really want anonymous requested documents to
be linkable, so you would need to do stealth encoding of the messages.
This tends to be more complex for multiple recipients, but it is
doable, and is made easier by standardising on public key size.
In general I think I consider my Eternity USENET design more secure
than your design and of similar overhead depending on whether the
usage pattern results in lower bandwidth.  I make this claim because
users are offered better security with E-USENET because they are
completely anonymous, and don't need to submit requests.  They can
passively read E-USENET, perhaps on a university campus, or with a
satellite USENET feed.  The readers are much harder to detect.
This is significant because remailers are complex to use, and the
users should be assumed to be less technically able (ie more likely to
screw up remailer usage).
Publisher anonymity is of basically the same security.
A lower bandwidth alternative, to either E-USENET or what you have
termed Automated BlackNet alternative is therefore to send messages
via use-once mixmaster remailer reply blocks of the sort used by some
nymservers.  Clearly this is also lower security because the user must
creating reply blocks which ultimately point back to himself.
However the performance win is big.  With this architecture BlackNet
can win significantly over E-USENET because the volume is reduced to
just indexes of available documents.
Also I consider indexes are probably low enough risk for people to
mirror on the web or cache on the web or whatever.  My E-USENET
prototype design has a separate index mechanism.
(I understand there is some magic inside mixmaster which prevents
packet replay, which helps avoid message flood attacks, though didn't
locate the code fragment responsible for this functionality when I
examined the sources.)
Also I found your use of hashes and passwords so that the server does
not necessarily know what it is serving interesting.  I have similar
functionality in my prototype E-USENET implementation.
I mainly included the functionality because the prototype is also
being used as an publically accessible eternity USENET proxy, to allow
the operator to marginally reduce risks.  I think this approach is of
marginal value, in that the attacker will be easily able to compile an
index from the same information as users.
This is really a form of secret splitting: the key is one part, and
the data the other part.  The key can be considered to be part of the
I have done most of the work already I think.  What you are trying to
do is so similar that you should be able to acheive what you want with
some light hacking of my perl code.
For testing purposes I am in the same position as you; dialup ppp
connection and linux machine.  What I did was to implement both
newspool access code, and NNTP access code.
For local testing I just create a dummy news-spool.  The eternity
distribution comes with a few documents in this dummy news spool.  A
real local news spool would work also.
Then you can simulate everything you want offline.  You can change the
config file to switch to an open access NNTP news-server at any time
for a live test.
All the code to read USENET is there, and to scan chosen NNTP headers,
etc.  I would highly recommend perl as a rapid prototyping language.
What you see took 3 days (long days, mind, motivation was at an all
time high around then).

7) Bob notices the post from the server, and anonymously posts a second
   request to alt.anonymous.messages, this time encrypted with the
   server's public key. This second request could include Bob's public
   key.
8) The server notices and decrypts the second request, and anonymously    posts the requested document to alt.anonymous.messages, encrypted with
   Bob's public key if one was provided.
The reason for steps 6 and 7 are to prevent multiple servers from
responding to the same request with (potentialy) very large files. Of
course, if Bob knew the data was available from a particular ABNS, he
could skip steps 5 and 6.
Both the client and server software should be trivial to write, and in
fact I am working on that now. The server is partially written, but I am
at a handicap because I do not have access to usenet at this time. If
anyone knows of some canned code (preferably sh or c, but perl would work)
that will perform functions such as "Retrieve list of articles in
newsgroup x" and "Retrieve article number y", a pointer would be nice.
So far, this is not too exciting, but the addition of a couple of extra
technologies could make it very usefull... If the "Steganographic File System" being proposed by Ross Anderson comes
to fruition, the ABNS could recieve a filename and password as part of
each submission, and then promptly 'forget' them. In this way, not only
does the server not have access to the contents of the file, it doesn't
even know what files it has! Retrieval requests would include the
appropriate information to enable the server to fetch the data.
The addition of digital cash to the picture would make it really viable,
because the server could charge for storage, or retrieval, or both. So picture this:
Alice has some data she wants to sell. She encrypts this data to the
public key of an ABNS, along with the filename and password to be used for
file access and an amount of cash sufficient to pay for storage costs for
maybe 6 months. She would also specify a 'value' for the data, which the
ABNS will charge for access to this data and of which Alice will recieve a
cut. She could also send a small advertisement (for which here storage
fees should be minimal) as a separate document, and give it a value of
The server decrypts the message and verifies the cash. It then stores the
file in the designated filename/password location in the SFS (stego file
system). It makes a hash of the filename/password, and stores this hash
in a 'table of contents' file that would also contain:
- - the 'paid-until' date for the data.
- - the public key of the submitter.
- - the 'price' for the data
It would then forget the filename and password.
Bob learns of the existance of the data (how? I haven't thought about that
yet but it doesn't seem to me that it would present much of a problem) and
wishes to purchase it. He sends a message to the server by encrypting to
the server's public key and posting to alt.anonymous.messages. In his
message he includes the filename/password of the data he wants, along with
an appropriate amount of cash and Bob's public key.
The server decrypts Bob's request: - - First, it pockets the cash. (Everything else is just to keep customers)
- - It then creates a hash based on the filename/password of the data that
  Bob is requesting. - - It looks up that hash in the table of contents file.
- - If it is not found, it anonymously posts a message encrypted to Bob's
  public key indicating that the data is not available, but that Bob now
  has a line of credit at this particular ABNS. :)  - - If it _does_ find the hash in the contents file, it checks the
  paid-until date. - - If the file is not paid up, the server treats it as if the file were not
  present (and in fact, it deletes the file at this time, something it
  could not do without the filename/password that Bob supplied). - - If the file is present, and storage fees are paid up, and Bob has
  enclosed enough cash (or has enough credit), the ABNS accesses the file
  in the stego filesystem and anon-posts it to Bob's public key.
- - The server then forgets the filename/password, but remembers the hash.
- - Of the 'fee' collected from Bob, the server allocates it as follows:
  - 70% is kept.
  - 10% is credited to the hash retrieved by Bob, to extend it's "Paid up"
    time. This means that documents that bring in a lot of money can pay
    for thier own storage costs, without the contributer needing to keep     paying.
  - 20% is encrypted to the public key listed in the table of contents and
    posted to alt.anonymous.messages, as a royalty to the contributor.
  Of course, this is just one possible policy for the server to have.
  Market forces will shape the eventual pricing scheme.
I'm actualy not sure if such a system would be used, because Alice may
have no motivation to send her data to an ABNS when she can run the server
herself and take 100% of the money. Comments on this aspect of operation
would be appreciated.
Either way, the same software could be used. I hope to post initial
versions within a couple of weeks, assuming I can hack myself some account
with nntp access for testing.

@_subject: remailer resistancs to attack 
Public access servers aren't a good idea.  Really people should be
running local access servers only.  The index is local, cache is
local, and USENET is a distributed broadcast medium.
Seems close to ideal to me, the problem being as Tim points out:
bandwidth limitations.  The bandwidth limitation is debilitating; to
overcome this we have to relax security, for example by using
remailers rather than USENET for all but indexes of documents.
One criticism I noticed several people raise was that USENET would be
shut down as a way to kill eternity USENET when something
controversial gets posted.
However it seems to me that the weakest point is the remailer network.
It seems likely that it would be much easier for governments to shut
down the remailer network than it would be to shut down USENET.  There
are only around 20 or so remailers, and they all have known IP
addresses, operators, localities, etc.  I expect the spooks could shut
them down with less than 1 days notice if they wanted to.
So, where would blacknet, and eternity USENET be after that?
How do we improve the resistance of the remailer network to well
resourced attackers intent on dismantling it?

Tim May I am more and more seeing the similarities between BlackNet and
Eternity USENET.  The only real difference that I can see is that for
E-USENET I have been talking about periodically broadcasting the data
to allow very high security for the reader, and also the idea of
keeping a local copy of the documents so that data is pre-fetched to
speed up accesses.
Both designs are relying heavily on the anonymity provided by
remailers.  For very high risk traffic, even using mixmaster remailers
may be risky due to the various active attacks which could be mounted
by a well resourced attacker with ability to selectively deny service.
An eternity service or blacknet information provider could frustrate
the active attacker by having many software agents with different
network connectivity and using these resources unpredictably.
One big opportunity we have is to subvert protocols of new services.
A distributed web replacement with ecash payment for page hits I think
is plausible.  Web pages could migrate to meet demand.  You could have
a hot-potatoe effect, where high risk documents are not kept for long

the public prime modulus.
You can also opportunistically send use once Elgamal keys in messages

Local eternity servers get their data from a news feed.  Preferably a
local news feed, or a satellite based feed, or second choice SSL

(Reason for local news feed being preferabl is that it protects the
NNTP traffic which would otherwise allow eavesdroppers to observer
which articles you were reading.  SSL is only a partial solution
because you are then trusting the SSL NNTP server operator.) Local servers don't generate any traffic, "local server" is really a
misnomer, it is a local proxy for reading news... it presents a view
of USENET articles which makes them appear as web pages.  It keeps
copies of those web pages more up to date versions are read in news,
this allows fast access to the web space.
There is a trade off between update period and size of web space as
the amount of USENET traffic you can generate without annoying people

[horrible line wraps btw. 100 chars to the line! I reformatted.]
There are 3 distinct threats.
1. communications crypto used by the author in submitting the document
   is broken
2. the eternity architecture contains encrypted documents to frustrate
   attempts to locate documents, and to hide the contents of documents
   from individual servers
3. communications crypto used to request and deliver documents is
   broken thus revealing the readers identity
For threat 1. the attacker needs archives of old communications which
could potentially be eternity submissions.  (I say potentially because
they could be steganographically encoded).  It is probably reasonable
to assume that the NSA has a full historic archive of USENET.  Also it
is probably reasonable to assume they have a historic archive of all
inter remailer traffic.
For threat 2. it seems feasible to upgrade this security over time, in
that documents could be super encrypted with newer ciphers when
vulnerabilities are found in older ciphers.  No protection for
historic access requests, but at least we can adapt to protect new
For threat 3. again newer ciphers can be used as attacks are found.
So it is useful to design upgrade paths for ciphers into the protocols
where possible.
Other approaches we could take are to use very conservative cipher key
sizes and protocols combining multiple ciphers in ways which gives us
the security of the best of the ciphers.
For example:
Where 5DES is say E-D-E-D-E with 5 independent DES keys.
Constructs to combine in strong ways hash functions, macs, symmetric
and asymmetric ciphers would be useful.  Is there much research in

I had a look and their approach is very similar to that of hashcash.
Thanks for posting the reference, I found the paper very interesting,
and have contacted the authors (and Kevin (who is also webmaster of
 with comments.  Their work predates hashcash by
about 4 years.  They have the same idea of using a CPU cost function
to combat unsolicited bulk email and other unmetered resource abuses.
Their cost functions are not based on hash collisions, but on public
key problems.  The use of public key problems allows them to construct
a trap-door cost function.  The holder of the private key can compute
valid tokens cheaply.  This allows them to propose a third party which
sells bulk email tokens without itself having to have large CPU
resources.  Their example application is what they see as legitimate
bulk emails, like conference calls.  (I am not sure I always agree
with this -- I get no end of spam conference calls which I have no
interest in attending or submitting to, but the functionality of
trap-door cost functions does allow more flexibility).
Their cost functions are more expensive to verify than hashcash
because they involve modular exponentations.
I can simulate the short cut cost function functionality with
symmetric encryption techniques by modifying the hashcash protocol.
Users, or service providers wishing to participate in enabling a third
party to sell tokens to bulk emailers for their email address(es) can
aid the third party in bypassing the hashcash verification process on
their eternity filter.
This can be done with no databases on the ISP mail hub server
(preserving privacy), and with no real time communications required
between trusted bulk email token seller and mail hub.

@_subject: eternity economics (Re: (eternity) Eternity as a secure filesystem/backup medium 
If the would be disseminater was happy to have their name associated
with the document, they could put it on their own web page.  The
problems may be that:
- they do not want to suffer the legal and extra-legal reprisals for
  posting, - they have little faith in the data remaining available for long on
  their web page, once well resourced determined attackers try to remove
  it.
Eternity helps here in that it obscures the poster's identity, and
reduces their exposure in that they personally don't have to send as
many messages.  Eternity also helps ensure continued availability, at
least while somebody is funding that availability.
Releasing the data themselves is problematic.  They may not wish to
accept the risk.  Eternity provides a way to pay someone else to take
the risks in ensuring availability.
The users is getting value for money from the eternity servers -- the
eternity server is providing the service of risk taking.
It is true that someone could pay for accessing the data, and resubmit
it to eternity with themselves as the beneficiary.  They would likely
want to undercut the price charged by the initial poster.  This
suggests a recursive auction market with prices falling over time.
The eternity server operators win in that they are being paid for
their services.
The original poster possibly doesn't make that much money, but the
operator could counter by reducing their prices over time to undercut
other copies also.
There are other ways where the submitter could get higher prices.  He
could for example post the data in encrypted form, and send the
decryption key to a high reputation third party to verify the
authenticity of the data.  He could then demand $10,000 for the key.
Bids would be placed by users interested in obtaining the data.  When
the bid price is reached the data is posted.  Bids would be held in
escrow by the third party.  In the event that the requested price is
not met the ecash could be returned to the bidders.
The market will discover the value of the risk taking services
provided by the eternity servers in that if the servers over-charge,
users will take their own risks, by starting their own servers.  If a
given server under-charges, other servers will sub contract to that
server.  There is a risk here that the NSA may offer eternity services at
prices undercutting everyone else.  This risk suggests that users
would not necessarily select the cheapest services.  If this pattern
of usage emerges, it also suggests that the NSA would better optimise
their efficacy by not offering the cheapest prices.
The problem of preventing eternity servers sub-contracting all their
work to the cheapest eternity-server (the NSA operated servers)
suggests that it may be desirable to design a system so that the
poster, or some third party auditing agent is able to verify where
data resides.
I can not see how this can generally be achieved, because it seems
difficult to verify whether a server is sub-contracting or not.
So in conclusion the safest strategy seems to be to select random
servers regardless of price.  This results in a flat demand curve, and
no incentive for servers to offer cheap service.
The model is more complex that this in that there are different risk
documents and this risk would affect the price a submitter is willing
to pay.

@_subject: proving that one knows how to break RSA 
Bill Payne's claim to having discovered a faster factorization
algorithm than the current state of the art, allows us to invoke the
oft discussed mechanisms for the author to prove this ability without
divulging the algorithm, and then proceed to sell the algorithm to the
highest bidder, whilst minimizing his chances of being killed.
I am sure many here remember various past discussions which were based
on the "what if" question: one has discovered a fast factorization
algorithm and our aims as discoverer are to:
- maximise price for selling algorithm
- minimise chance of being killed by the NSA to silence one
- proving that we posses a fast algorithm Minimising our chances of being killed would seem to rely on:
- posting our sale via BlackNet (ie posting anonymously)
- having a disclosure mechanism in place which will be invoked on the
  eventuality of our premature death in an unfortunate `accident'
Bill Payne seems to have already blown the first option in disclosing
his identity.  His dilemma is now that if the highest bidder is the
NSA, they may kill him afterwards to prevent a release of the
algorithm.  This is where a robust disclosure mechanism in event of
premature death would be useful.  I hope Bill has invested in such a
Maximise price for selling algorithm: hold out for the highest bidder.
Or perhaps sell to multiple parties with NDAs (would NDAs be
sufficient to protect such valuable information?)
Are there any reasons why Bill should be refusing to divulge the
algorithm?  Perhaps he is waiting for a higher bid.  What is the
current highest bid?  What about alternate motives?  Perhaps he is not
interested in money, but rather in proving NSA incompetence?
Or if Bill doesn't in fact have an algorithm, what would be the
motives for falsely claiming that he does?  Is he working for the NSA
to spread FUD?
Lastly proving that Bill has a fast algorithm (or acess to some nice
hardware at NSA).  Several RSA public key challenges are posted and
Bill posts the factorization of the public key.  There are
conveniently pre-published RSA challenges in the form of rsa.com's RSA
factoring challenge with multiples of two primes ranging in sizes
going up in steps of 10 in decimal digits.
It would I think provide best assurance if challenges of both sorts
were broken, in that the RSA challenges have been available for some
time, and Bill could have been working on RSA 140 for the last 3 years
or whatever.

Well theoretically we could go for 32 characters for a MD5 hash output
only.  SHA1 would be better at 40 characters.  (We could brute force a
hash length reduction and maybe claw back 4 characters at an expected
cost of 2^32 hash runs).
The printed hash could be the output of the hash function run on a
text document including the keys which we mirror in various places.
We can include any text we want to authenticate in this document,
keys, time stamp hash tree outputs, URLs, mailing list addresses,
We are at 40 characters for an SHA1 output, or maybe only 32
characters with a bit of brute-forcing.  What do you mean that you must include ID?  Someone must give an email
address, or phone number?  Should be ok to fit one of those in the
remaining 24 - 32 chars.  Or a URL.  "jya.com" easy.

There are a few other scenarios which suggest he may be at risk even
if he doesn't publish.  Firstly if we argue on the basis that he does
have a fast algorithm:
- if the NSA thinks they already know the algorithm he has discovered,
  they may kill him anyway to prevent disclosure to others
- the NSA may kidnap him, inject him with various truth drugs, and
  generally torture the information from him, and then kill him
Insurance in the form of a disclosure procedure in the event of his
premature death will reduce his risk of being killed.
Secondly if we argue on the basis that Bill doesn't have a fast
factoring algorithm, or is mistaken about the complexity of his
- if the NSA thinks his claim credible they may again kidnap him and
  attempt to extract this algorithm from him.  They may then kill him
  to prevent him talking about them torturing him if he reveals an
  algorithm, or appears not to have an algorithm
He appears to be in greater risk if falsely claiming he has a fast
algorithm if his claim appears credible to the NSA -- his insurance in
the form of a fall back public disclosure procedure in event of his

In general it seems generally a dangerous claim to make.

add an almost identifical feature to S/MIME (spooky how similar the
feature is even).  Most of the regular contributors on S/MIME work for
GAK sell out companies anyway, so I figure this is pretty much a done
(S/MIME already has another form of GAK also, in that the X.509 key
directory specs allow the directory to optionally keep _private_ keys
I think the ARR mechanism is actually more dangerous than keeping
locally escrowed copies of keys in PGP because of the web of trust
model.  (See:  for my thoughts on
In the S/MIME world where there is a more hierarchical approach to
Certification, you can expect government run CAs which demand a copy
of your private key also.  (eg. the UK DTI document on crypto
licensing proposals was talking about this method).  For S/MIME,
S/MIME style ARR seems fairly balanced in lethality to CAs which keep
private keys.
I wonder if Phil Zimmermann feels proud of himself now that S/MIME
looks like it will adopt his CAK/GAKware design.
You might be amused at this introductory remark from the proposer on
S/MIME IETF:
: As a side note, this is not a radically new concept as something very
: similar has already been proposed and implemented by PGP.
:  : Flames welcome.
The guy's proposal below.  It was well received too.  Someone else
proposed adding it in as a core MUST S/MIME requirement to handle
these additional recipient requests.
(You can follow the thread on the hypertext archive at (look for IETF S/MIME mailing list, or by subscribing to
ietf-smime at imc.org).
A new and somewhat radical thread....
Because I believe the following to be true:
- Requiring key recovery is a bad thing (complexity, cost,
  implementation, etc.)
- Companies do have a need to access mail encrypted to or encrypted by
  their employees (lost keys, legal investigations, etc)
- We are all working on methods of satisfying US export requirements
  so that we can export a cryptographically useful product
- The is a middle step between full key recovery and no hope of
  recovery which involves encrypting messages to a 'corporate key' in
  addition to a individual public key when sending a message.
Basically, what is involved is changing the user certificate format to
designate a field for a second certificate which represents the
corporate public key appropriate for that user.  An application
intending to encrypt mail to that user MUST then encrypt the message
to both the user key and the corporate key.
By no means am I implying that everyone that implements S/MIME leave a
back door into all of their messages.  However, since most companies
that are implementing secure messaging are setting up their own CA
(Entrust, OnSite, Netscape, etc.) and they have control over what
fields are populated and with what information, they are able to
choose whether or not they need visibility into their own data.
As a side note, this is not a radically new concept as something very
similar has already been proposed and implemented by PGP.
Flames welcome.

John Kelsey  writes on cpunks:
If we assume that the document was submitted by mixmaster remailer,

Now threat model is that NSA is archiving mail between mixmaster
nodes.  They observe which exit mail corresponds to the target
document.  They look at the set of mixmaster mails going into that
node which could plausibly have corresponded to that message as
determined by the pool size.
Repeat to get back to originator.  If we assume 100 message pool size
(probably generous) and chain of length 10, that is 1000 decryptions
which adds equivalent to 10 bits worth of symmetric key size.
Paranoid stuff yes, but the NSA mixmaster traffic archive doesn't seem
that unlikely.
It is interesting to note that Tim May's recent suggestion of LAM
(Local Area Mixes) would help here because if 5 of those mixmaster
nodes where part of a LAM, it is unlikely that the NSA would be able
to archive inter remailer traffic, thus increasing effective pool size
to 100^5.  So one advantage of the LAM approach is that it provides
links which are protected by physical security.
A user might like to amuse himself trying to use channels he suspects
will not be archived as the entry point.  Perhaps a disposable account
at a high volume free mail account like hot mail might be nice.  We
would like to push NSA's problem towards having to archive the entire
net traffic.
The design criteria of efficiency and robustness are conflicting.  Our
problem is to design something with useful tradeoffs.  Probably a
system offering a range of trade offs so that low risk documents can
make use of more efficient but less secure services, etc.
Yes.  We need to build constructs for all areas.  A mega hash would be
nice, with a large output size even in the face of birthday attack,
preferably as secure as a collection of hash functions.
That gives us something to wash our pseudo random number input entropy
with, and then we can go on to combine public key systems.
A problem with public key systems however is that there isn't a lot of
choice -- basically all based on discrete log or factoring.  So
perhaps RSA and DH combined in a construct with an optimistically
proportioned key size would be near all that could be done.
A variation of this is that if we can get widely deployed blanket
encryption (IPSEC), we have largely won because we can mix all sorts
of things below that envelope, and the NSA is reduced to archiving
some large proportion of network traffic.  Our task is then to design
protocols which aggresively rekey (earliest opportunity) and which
maximise the number of nodes which the NSA would need to archive
traffic between to recover traffic with future cryptanalysis.
I suspect archiving world Network traffic would pose something of a
operational and financial strain :-)

Could this process not be simplified by Netscape (hint Tom) having a

Then an interested third party may print it on paper and snail it out
of the US, or simply make use of a remailer; either way once it is
outside the US we have legal full strength netscape.
Another area which could use some attention is that the netscape
distribution license seems to result in large european ftp sites
carrying only the 40 bit version.  Anything that would free up the
license might encourage more sites to carry the 128 bit versions.

@_subject: how to ensure 128 bit netscape is used world wide (Re: Exporting Code the Easy Way) 
Agree strongly.
The problem is not in the export, which as Tim says happens soon
enough anyway, as anyone can verify looking at  where a
good collection of 128 bit browsers can be obtained.
The problem is netscape's distribution license.  I tried to work out
why netscape is only carried at certain sites, and why all of the
sites which do carry it carry 40 bit.  The answer seems to be that
even though the netscape browser is free for academic use, that
netscape tries to control distribution by requiring distributing sites
to sign their distribution license.
Netscape's motive for this restrictive distribution license I presume
is an attempt to reduce risk of hacked copies (say with virususes
embedded) being distributed.  By keeping the number of sites
controlled (albeit by weak legal mechanism) they keep the sites to a
small number of large reputable ftp sites.
This leads to the conclusion that the best thing netscape could do is:
- not distribute a 40 bit version in electronic form at all, forcing
  overseas sites to keep 128 bit versions
- have shrink wrap 40 bit versions sold overseas if they must, but
  have strict license prohibiting electronic distribution
- modify the distribution license to allow free distribution of the
  128 bit version (none of this distributors must sign a license)
- ensure that the license on the purchased 40 bit version allows one
  to use the freely obtained 128 bit version in a commercial setting
Problem solved.  No need to fiddle around with printing source code in
books, or to waste time remove crypto calls and hooks from source
code, nor waste some one elses time recoding the omitted code.
So, how about it netscape?

- what stunt would create most publicity
- who in the press should be contacted
- which computer companies and who to contact with in them to donate

it may be for example that plenty of publicity can be had for free
with a suitable stunt, if media can be interested.

This arose out of a discussion on ukcrypto about NAI (which PGP Inc is
now part of) having recently rejoined the KRA list -- I notice that
nCipher are on it too, and there was a earlier exchange on ukcrypto
about nCipher...
nCipher too are now on the KRAP list (wonder how long for?)
Bruce Tober forwards from nCipher fairly recently made some press release that was commented on
on this list as sounding a bit in favour of UK/DTI/GCHQ GAK attempts.
Then they claimed that it was just being read incorrectly and the text
was neutral and the title that was badly chosen and by hired PR.
So nCipher guys, how do you explain the membership of KRAP away?
: We do not have any weakened or GAK products.  The Marketing Director
: has assured me that we have no plans to produce any.
: So, in summary, there are no artificial restrictions on the sizes of
: keys which can be used, generated or stored by our units, and no
: backdoor GAK or key recovery facilities.
given the KRAP membership one might have cause to be worry that this
may not still be true.  Perhaps people using recent nCipher boards or
with recent software upgrades ought to read the specs real closely --
to see if it admits to encrypting stuff to GCHQ also!
Ian also wrote (in a post marked as not an official nCipher statement):
: I personally would feel that putting deliberate backdoors or other
: similar things into our products would be highly unethical and I would
: have nothing to do with it.
: This has nothing to do with the spooks or escrow or anything of the
: kind.  That's what GAK and KRAP is all about -- putting backdoors into
products which the government and secret service groups like GCHQ,
NSA and ECHELON get the keys to.
: I do believe that the personal views of senior management at
: nCipher - particularly towards the technical end - are opposed to
: escrow et al.
Perhaps those technical types could have a go at prevailing over
whichever marketing type or suit decided to sign up for KRAP.
This is not intended to attack Ian, as he seemed pretty much against
GAK, and Niko van Someren to some extent too.  Not so sure about the
other non technical can Someren, but clearly someone in nCipher thinks
KRAP and GAK are a good marketing ploy.
Otherwise, I figure you're better off giving money to DEC alpha than
supporting GAKkers.  Alpha's run SSLeay pretty fast.
and a second post, with more specifics:
here we go:
        since May 97!
contains such gems as:
:       We are delighted to support the Key Recovery Alliance," said
:       Alex van Someren, President of nCipher. so that pin-points at least one GAK enthousiast at nCipher.
It also makes for some rather strange contradictions.  The flap about
nCiphers apparent whole-hearted support for DTI GAK attempts was May
this year -- nCipher had already been a paid up KRAP member for a
whole year.
press release continues (least there is any confusion as to what KRA
as an organisation is about):
: Encryption makes information readable only to a person holding a
: unique "key" which will unlock the data. Encryption is critical to
: ensure the security of sensitive information that is either stored
: electronically or sent over public networks such as the Internet.
: Key recovery is a new method that allows for authorized access
: to encrypted information without the need to store or "escrow"
: any encryption keys with a third party. Key recovery is an
: effective tool to meet commercial, private and institutional needs.
institutions obliquely mentioned being presumably the likes of GCHQ and NSA?
yet Ian was saying:
saying there were no key recovery facilities, and
: We do not have any weakened or GAK products.  The Marketing Director
: has assured me that we have no plans to produce any.
and no plans to install any.  yet this is what KRA is all about, and they
were signed up to it already at that time.
I suppose someone is now going to try to claim that KRA is all about
key recovery for commercial purposes, but not for government -- but
this is not the way I understand that KRA came into being at all.
I think it is very much a NSA led attempt to further the clipper
attempts.  If I recall it started in the wake of the NSA/NIST attempts
at clipper IV (or whatever number it was at by then) to coerce
companies into including software based key escrow.
Probably tied up with the permission to use marginally higher key
lengths if the company can demonstrate to NSA a plan to introduce GAK
in two year time scale (within the US), though I may be forgetting the
details.  Anyone like to clarify KRAs aims and history?

user can use keys for (not for certification for example), and
generally inability to use clients without cert obtained from another
KRA member -- verisign, all add up to bad news.  The whole mess can be
controlled by GAKkers via the CA, and the CAs are the target for
example of the UK GAK attempt being led by the DTI (Department of
Trade and Industry -- meant to be representing industry, but instead
trying it's level best to put GCHQ / ECHELON interests ahead of
business interests, as acknowledged by DTI winning Privacy
International's hall of shame award.).
To expand briefly on the UK (DTI) current proposal: it seems to be
that they are trying to stack the deck by giving signatures made with
a key certified by a UK government "licensed" CA given better
recognition in law than signatures made by an unlicensed CA.  The
licensed CA doesn't have to escrow signatures keys, but if it does and
provides any service relating to confidentiality keys also it must
also keep private keys.  (Deliverable to GCHQ / ECHELON within 1 hr 24
hours a day 365 days a year -- GAK on steroids).
Someone on ukcrypto coined the phrase `licensed to leak' to express
the government coerced baggage that goes with a licensed CA.
Indeed roll on the GPG.

I've commented about this on this list before I believe.  This appears
to be a case of really old news suddenly being dredged up for no
apparent wholesome reason -- which strikes me as quite odd because
Wired was apparently so eager to break this ancient story that they
didn't wait to ask anyone from NAI about it.
NAI being listed on the KRA page is *solely* a result of our TIS
acquisition.  I really doubt anyone here actually called some KRA
person and officially renewed our membership.  Frankly, I doubt anyone
here actually knows who to talk to there -- if there even is a
"there".  As I have said before, due to the TIS acquisition, NAI now
has a bunch of products which contain key escrow features. Eliminating or modifying these features such that they work in a less
big brother-like fashion will take significant time -- indeed entire
TIS products were based around managing key escrow infrastructures. Don't get me wrong, TIS had a lot of other great products, but it will
take time to redesign and rethink some of them in the context of
export and key escrow.  I'm not sure there's much point in withdrawing
from KRA when those products still exist.
These issues have no effect whatsoever on the PGP group.  As always,
we continue to publish full source code which effectively solves all
the export issues for us.

To comment on Will Price's comments I forwarded earlier today:
I didn't heard anything other than speculation as to whether the TIS
acquisition would result in NAI rejoining KRA.  The news is that it
now is listed again (or at least someone noticed that it is now
listed).  Perhaps I was not paying attention, but I didn't hear anyone
from PGP announce that NAI had rejoined (or automatically rejoined)
KRA as a result of TIS merger.
Surely some of your TIS GAKware colleagues know all about KRAP --
being major league GAKkers, and having specifically signed up in the
first place, being leading contributers to the KRAP/GAK drive effort.
Watch terminology here.  TIS stuff contains GAK -- "key escrow" or
"message recovery" where the government has the master keys.
All commercial PGP versions 5.x and higher contain key recovery in the
form of PGP's "Corporate Message Recovery" (CMR) design.  Even the
personal use versions know how to cooperate in providing corporate
Now CMR is clearly much less objectionable than TIS stuff, tho'
politically debatable I would argue.  TIS stuff is outright GAK.  But
I think part of the point of KRA was to coerce/bribe crypto companies
to demonstrate working and workable NSA master key type GAK.
The problem people have had with PGP building a CMR / CKE mechanism is
you as a side effect demonstrate a method which would be workable as
an NSA master key GAK system.  Clearly all that is missing is software
configuration and the NSA to publish a key, and a law requiring use of
Yeah, OK so there was always encrypt to self, but giving the NSA
ammunition is bad (viz the quotes from US government saying that Key
Recovery works and using PGP 5.x as an example).  I think that helping
the US government claim that GAK is workable is a bad result for a
company with PGP's privacy stance to end up contributing to.
I am glad that CMR was kept out of the OpenPGP spec.
Will seems to be saying here that NAI is planning to remove GAK from
the TIS products acquired in the NAI purchase of TIS.
Firstly this is interesting because I wonder who is pulling the
strings inside NAI -- consider: NAI paid a lot more for TIS than they
paid for PGP.  TIS has lots of US government defense contracts
(presumably partly as bribery for assistance to US Government with
KRAP/the GAK drive).
Secondly he comments that it will take significant time to make the
TIS products less big brother like.  I don't buy this.  You've got the
source code -- just release a patch to fill the GAK field with garbage.
Sounds like a days work tops.
Sure there is.  The bad PR of being in KRAP alone should make it worth
quiting.  This was why PRZ arranged the pull out last time around.
Secondly pulling out of KRA would be a nice way to back up your claims
that NAI intends to remove the GAK from the bought TIS products.  If
NAI intends to do this, what is the point of being a member of KRA
which is all about acheiving the reverse -- about putting GAK into
Glad to hear it.  The effect it does have is in reputation damage due
to PR fall out.  Some people may prefer not to buy from a company
supporting the US government in it's attempts to force key escrow onto
users.  NAI is pulling in two directions, TIS and KRA membership, and

Writing about PGP's key recovery mechanism (CMR (Commercial Message

from a letter he sent to info
I don't see that ethics has any bearing on the difference between Key
Escrow, and PGP's CMR "message recovery" design.  They are both just
yet another protocol to allow third parties to decrypt encrypted
Ethics enter into the discussion when one one starts to argue about
which third parties will be able to eavesdrop on the traffic.  This
issue is largely orthogonal to the general technique used.
Parties which people are most concerned about having access to data
are the spooks and governments via organisations such as NSA, GCHQ,
ECHELON etc.  In a commercial setting there is also some political
debate about whether the employee has any expectation of privacy.
One might also argue about whether it is ethical to design software
which helps or makes it easy for third parties to gain access to the
plaintext in general.
So one has to be clear of one's aims in asking KRA if they think PGP's
CMR or ADK is a nice technology for adding NSA backdoors to crypto.
Say, for example that they decided that CMR is neater than their CKRB
mechanism.  Now what?  NSA/KRA lobby companies to include a modified
CMR with the NSA's public key as a mandatory additional recipient?
And NAI gets `asked' by the NSA to burn an NSA public key into PGP 7.

   I am struggling on the difference between SMIME and PGP. One of my
   wants to make the decision between using SMIME and PGP. I have been talking
   already with them but we got stuck in detailes.
   Basically its quit clear. SMIME will be supported by all important industry
   leaders such as Netscape, Microsoft, Novell etc. I'd like to note that PGP is supported by NAI, Microsoft, Novell, and more
that are coming soon.
   Further SMIME supports the
   hierarchical trust model and PGP only supports the "web of trust" model. Actually, this is false. PGP supports all trust models, direct trust,
hierarchical trust, and web of trust. As I said in my previous message, PGP
supports 255 levels of hierarchy.
However, I forgot to say that OpenPGP does not mandate *any* trust model.
As a matter of fact, the OpenPGP working group has rejected any mandate of
trust model. You are permitted to use an OpenPGP certificate with PKIX
evaluation rules, and still be OpenPGP compliant!
   Now
   with PGP Version 6.0, PGP will support also X.509 certificates. Those
can also
   be loaded into an PGP client than an SMIME Client can do it.
   So where is the difference now? Is it just the fact that the industry
decided to
   go with SMIME or are there more differences (advantages for SMIME) when
   more closely.
Actually, the industry hasn't decided to go with anything. Furthermore,
there is no reason why you can't have PGP messages backed by X.509
certificates, and it is trivial to use S/MIME with OpenPGP certificates.
I'm planning on writing a short informational RFC on how to do it once we
all get RFC numbers for our respective systems.
   For instance using RSA public key encryption versus Deffie Helman public
   encryption. How about Digital Signature Standard (DSS)? I have red about
DSS and
   understand that DSS is the standard that provides the Digital Signature
   Algorithm. Before applying it there has to be calculated an Digest using
SHA. I
   always thought that calculating the digest would be the signature
already!! So
   why using the DSA in addition? Will the digest be decrypted using the
   Helman private key? The issue of algorithm is orthogonal to message encoding. The PGP-S/MIME
question is really one of message encoding format. Each requires DSS, and
allows RSA.
The DSS (Digital Signature Standard) describes how to make a signature
using DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm).
That's how they relate. You could (for example) use DSA with RIPEMD-160,
but it wouldn't be DSS because DSS specifies the hash algorithm you should
be using for the signature.
DSA is a signature-only algorithm. Consequently, you aren't doing a
"decryption" with it when you evaluate a signature. I recommend you look in
a crypto source book, like Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" or Menezes,
van Oorschot, and Vanstone's "Handbook of Applied Cryptography" for details
of how DSS is done. There is also source code available from a wide variety
of places.
   Users that apply Deffie Helman exchange their public values
   in order to derive an secret key that will be known at both party sides.
Is that
   secret key the private key used to encrypt message digests or is the
private key
   generated by the DSA algorithm?
Like I said, DSS has its own signature-only key. As for "Diffie-Hellman"
depending on the variant of DH you're using, you may or may not have an
actual key. Many real-time systems use ephemeral DH merely to exchange
symmetric keys. In OpenPGP, we use the Elgamal system for encryption.
S/MIME is using an X9.42 algorithm that is very close (if not identical) to
   In PGP further exist key rings that contain the public keys of other
users? How
   does that work with X.509 Certificates that actually contain the public
key. If
   there has to be a public key revoked, it happens in the key ring. Would
it be
   possible to export that revoked certificate. If not the revoked public
key would
   resist only lokally.
Most systems, be they PGP or X.509, use something akin to a directory to
store certs, revocations, etc. Typically, these are HTTP or LDAP based
   Are there any differences/advantages between RSA and Deffie Helman?
Again, this is orthoganal to encoding, as these are merely algorithms. But
yes, of course. The security of RSA is based upon the difficulty of
factoring large numbers. Most people who toss around the term
"Diffie-Hellman" use it to cover an entire family of algorithms whose
security is all based on the difficulty of solving discrete logs. These
include DSA, X9.42, Schnorr, and Elgamal. They are all approximately of the
same strength.
There are also a wide variety of advantages and disadvantages. Frequently,
these are the same. For example, in RSA encryption and signatures are the
same, which is simple, but leads to some hygenic problems. A signature-only
system like DSA is less flexible, but easier to export, and enforces good
key hygene (meaning that it is bad practice to use the same key for
signatures as for encryption). I could go on with a discussion of all this,
but this thread is already off-topic for this mailing list. Feel free to
mail me privately or phone.
   You see I am very confused right now and I have the feeling that all my
   theories woun�t match with those used in PGP.
There are many good reasons for being confused. One of the most important
ones is that there really aren't a lot of differences between the systems.
They are all trying to solve the same problem, but each has a slightly
different slant to it.
   I really would appreciate it if there would be someone helping my to
remove all
   that dust of my mind...

@_subject: copyright at the point of a gun 
On the Feds buying M$ software (no big deal ... if it suits them let
them buy it).
The real subsidy of M$ and any software vendor is the copyright,
patent, and license enforcement mechanism provided by the government.
Don't forget that copyright enforcement boils down to thugs with guns
coming to lock you up.
In a crypto-anarchic society concepts such as copyright, license and
patents have little meaning because the obvious statement of reality
is that once you have released something to another individual, you
lose all control over it.
With strong anonymity, ecash and so on, even things like GNU, patents,
export controls whatever can be swept away for individuals, and for
anonymous companies.  GNU license?  No problem, just ignore the
license.  Copright?  No problem just ignore the copyright notices,
strip them off.  Patents?  Ignore them to.
If people still buy software, or support contracts from anonymous
companies who ignore patents, well that is the market deciding what it
thinks of copyright.
Judging by the state of software-piracy with PC software with 80-90%+
piracy rates, the market is already pretty much ok with ignoring
copyright, and would be happy to have no copyrights.
The bounty scheme, support contracts are much closer to the natural
schelling points in a free society than "enforcement" of bit flow, and
FSF is the first wave.

STUDIES FIND REWARD OFTEN NO MOTIVATOR
Creativity and intrinsic interest diminish if task is done for gain
By Alfie Kohn
Special to the Boston Globe
[reprinted with permission of the author
 from the Monday 19 January 1987 Boston Globe]
In the laboratory, rats get Rice Krispies.  In the classroom the top
students get A's, and in the factory or office the best workers get
raises.  It's an article of faith for most of us that rewards promote
better performance.
But a growing body of research suggests that this law is not nearly as
ironclad as was once thought.  Psychologists have been finding that
rewards can lower performance levels, especially when the performance
involves creativity.
A related series of studies shows that intrinsic interest in a task -
the sense that something is worth doing for its own sake - typically
declines when someone is rewarded for doing it.
If a reward - money, awards, praise, or winning a contest - comes to
be seen as the reason one is engaging in an activity, that activity
will be viewed as less enjoyable in its own right.
With the exception of some behaviorists who doubt the very existence
of intrinsic motivation, these conclusions are now widely accepted
among psychologists.  Taken together, they suggest we may unwittingly
be squelching interest and discouraging innovation among workers,
students and artists.
The recognition that rewards can have counter-productive effects is
based on a variety of studies, which have come up with such findings
as these: Young children who are rewarded for drawing are less likely
to draw on their own that are children who draw just for the fun of
it.  Teenagers offered rewards for playing word games enjoy the games
less and do not do as well as those who play with no rewards.
Employees who are praised for meeting a manager's expectations suffer
a drop in motivation.
Much of the research on creativity and motivation has been performed
by Theresa Amabile, associate professor of psychology at Brandeis
University.  In a paper published early last year on her most recent
study, she reported on experiments involving elementary school and
college students.  Both groups were asked to make "silly" collages.
The young children were also asked to invent stories.
The least-creative projects, as rated by several teachers, were done
by those students who had contracted for rewards.  "It may be that
commissioned work will, in general, be less creative than work that is
done out of pure interest," Amabile said.
In 1985, Amabile asked 72 creative writers at Brandeis and at Boston
University to write poetry.  Some students then were given a list of
extrinsic (external) reasons for writing, such as impressing teachers,
making money and getting into graduate school, and were asked to think
about their own writing with respect to these reasons.  Others were
given a list of intrinsic reasons:  the enjoyment of playing with
words, satisfaction from self-expression, and so forth.  A third group
was not given any list.  All were then asked to do more writing.
The results were clear.  Students given the extrinsic reasons not only
wrote less creatively than the others, as judged by 12 independent
poets, but the quality of their work dropped significantly.  Rewards,
Amabile says, have this destructive effect primarily with creative
tasks, including higher-level problem-solving.  "The more complex the
activity, the more it's hurt by extrinsic reward," she said.
But other research shows that artists are by no means the only ones
In one study, girls in the fifth and sixth grades tutored younger
children much less effectively if they were promised free movie
tickets for teaching well.  The study, by James Gabarino, now
president of Chicago's Erikson Institute for Advanced Studies in Child
Development, showed that tutors working for the reward took longer to
communicate ideas, got frustrated more easily, and did a poorer job in
the end than those who were not rewarded.
Such findings call into question the widespread belief that money is
an effective and even necessary way to motivate people.  They also
challenge the behaviorist assumption that any activity is more likely
to occur if it is rewarded.  Amabile says her research "definitely
refutes the notion that creativity can be operantly conditioned."
But Kenneth McGraw, associate professor of psychology at the
University of Mississippi, cautions that this does not mean
behaviorism itself has been invalidated.  "The basic principles of
reinforcement and rewards certainly work, but in a restricted context"
- restricted, that is, to tasks that are not especially interesting.
Researchers offer several explanations for their surprising findings
about rewards and performance.
First, rewards encourage people to focus narrowly on a task, to do it
as quickly as possible and to take few risks.  "If they feel that
'this is something I hve to get through to get the prize,' the're
going to be less creative," Amabile said.
Second, people come to see themselves as being controlled by the
reward.  They feel less autonomous, and this may interfere with
performance.  "To the extent one's experience of being
self-determined is limited," said Richard Ryan, associate psychology
professor at the University of Rochester, "one's creativity will be
reduced as well."
Finally, extrinsic rewards can erode intrinsic interest.  People who
see themselves as working for money, approval or competitive success
find their tasks less pleasurable, and therefore do not do them as
The last explanation reflects 15 years of work by Ryan's mentor at the
University of Rochester, Edward Deci.  In 1971, Deci showed that
"money may work to buy off one's intrinsic motivation for an activity"
on a long-term basis.  Ten years later, Deci and his colleagues
demonstrated that trying to best others has the same effect.  Students
who competed to solve a puzzle quickly were less likely than those who
were not competing to keep working at it once the experiment was over.
Control plays role
There is general agreement, however, that not all rewards have the
same effect.  Offering a flat fee for participating in an experiment -
similar to an hourly wage in the workplace - usually does not reduce
intrinsic motivation.  It is only when the rewards are based on
performing a given task or doing a good job at it - analogous to
piece-rate payment and bonuses, respectively - that the problem
The key, then, lies in how a reward is experienced.  If we come to
view ourselves as working to get something, we will no longer find
that activity worth doing in its own right.
There is an old joke that nicely illustrates the principle.  An
elderly man, harassed by the taunts of neighborhood children, finally
devises a scheme.  He offered to pay each child a dollar if they would
all return Tuesday and yell their insults again.  They did so eagerly
and received the money, but he told them he could only pay 25 cents on
Wednesday.  When they returned, insulted him again and collected their
quarters, he informed them that Thursday's rate would be just a penny.
"Forget it," they said - and never taunted him again.
Means to and end
In a 1982 study, Stanford psychologist Mark L. Lepper showed that any
task, no matter how enjoyable it once seemed, would be devalued if it
were presented as a means rather than an end.  He told a group of
preschoolers they could not engage in one activity they liked until
they first took part in another.  Although they had enjoyed both
activities equally, the children came to dislike the task that was a
prerequisite for the other.
It should not be surprising that when verbal feedback is experienced
as controlling, the effect on motivation can be similar to that of
payment.  In a study of corporate employees, Ryan found that those who
were told, "Good, you're doing as you /should/" were "significantly
less intrinsically motivated than those who received feedback
There's a difference, Ryan says, between saying, "I'm giving you this
reward because I recognize the value of your work" and "You're getting
this reward because you've lived up to my standards."
A different but related set of problems exists in the case of
creativity.  Artists must make a living, of course, but Amabile
emphasizes that "the negative impact on creativity of working for
rewards can be minimized" by playing down the significance of these
rewards and trying not to use them in a controlling way.  Creative
work, the research suggests, cannot be forced, but only allowed to

Well I don't think it's unfair, and it's my post you quoted as an
example!  Anyone who writes something is clearly free to put anything
they like in their licenses.  This was not the point being made.
As there seems to be some confusion, let me try to summarise why
several people have said they prefer BSD license (or indeed LGPL) to
GNU GPL _in the particular case of crypto code_:
Cypherpunks are interested to deploy crypto code with out backdoors
(`cypherpunks write code' and all that).  Consider for a moment that
this is your primary aim.
It is useful to build upon on other cypherpunks code.  (Having to code
everything from scratch is going to take you a long time..., let's see
we'll start with re-writing a bignum library from scratch).
You would like your code to be widely deployed, and some companies are
good at distributing code.  If you could get them to include crypto in
their applications that would be a lot of crypto out there.
So when someone writes crypto code form this perspective the BSD
license better achieves their aim.  This is not an insult to the FSF's
aims.  The BSD license (for example) is in some ways more free than
the GNU license: it allows free distribution, but is less strict in
propagating this to derived works.  This lesser strictness is useful
for crypto deployment because it allows commercial derivative works
(what you have termed proprietary) software.  Cypherpunks want to
encourage these also, though they would prefer that source be
available so that people can check for quality, correctness, and for
The comments on having to re-write GNU code which several people made
(in the context of crypto software) are not saying that it is "unfair
that GNU contributers don't do free work for the cypherpunk cause",
what it is saying is this:
If your aim is to maximise crypto deployment, use BSD or some other
relatively free distribution license other than GNU, so that we can
more rapidly write and deploy crypto software to undermine the power
of the state.

more interesting than crypto deployment.  But as I said in the section
quoted above "If your aim is to maximise crypto deployment", use BSD.
ie. Cypherpunks may choose to sacrifice profit, or recognition for in
the interests of deployment.
Tho' actually even these assumptions you are making are not always
correct: for example Eric Young does not charge for his software, Eric
gets lots of recognition (partly because his license asks for this --
"this software includes work by Eric Young" requirement); Eric I dare
say has as much consultancy work offered to him to work on developing
free code as he has hours for.
I ended up doing some paid crypto development work on SSLeay (the
resulting additions were also BSD licensed), and the person asking me
to do this commented that they had asked Eric, but he had too much
So your theory doesn't work in this case: Eric is getting to make
money, get recognition, and maximise deployment.

Let me clue you in here: you are talking to the Caped Green one, who
currently is working for C2Net, which just happens to be selling
Stronghold, a commercial version of Apache, which is the most widely
used secure web server in the world.  Guess what: Apache uses SSLeay,
and Stronghold also inherits this.
I would also rate the folks at C2Net as pretty crypto clueful, btw.
2nd hint: C2Net is currently employing Eric Young also, and Eric's
SSLeay still has the same license.
What sense do cypherpunks mean strong crypto in then?  Perhaps you
could educate us?
They mean lots of crypto out there firstly, so that the when the
government tries the next GAK initiative the government has less
chance of pushing it through, as more people know what crypto is, and
understand how outrageous mandatory domestic GAK is.  Secondly they
mean strong crypto, as in full key strengths, and no flaws.  But
mainly their interest in deploying strong crypto by whatever means
available (commercial, freeware, or whatever) for a purpose: to
undermine the power of the state, to allow people to go about the
business unhindered by the state.
Cypherpunks also get involved in breaking crypto, and this is usually
enough to get massively commercially deployed strong crypto with
unintentional flaws converted quickly into massively deployed crypto
without the flaws.  eg. Netscape's random number generator weakness,
which netscape fixed immediately.
It's clear to pretty much all the cypherpunks I've seen contribute to
the thread, Eric, Perry, Adam Shostack, Jim McCoy, Bruce Schneier.
Probably there were some others who contributed to the thread also.
You don't get it, but then have you ever written any crypto code with
the objective of undermining the power of the state?  Is this your aim
in writing your open source application code that you name dropped?
This is what I meant by my short rant about coderpunks detracting from
the cypherpunk objective: siphons off 'punks from cypherpunks into a
crypto-politically neutral environment.  Then it gets increasingly
more crypto-politically neutral subscribers, and anyone reminding or
commenting that the original aim of the game was to distribute strong
crypto to undermine the state, gets told by the local retro moderators
that political stuff isn't welcome.

@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source code) 
Perry recently posted a summary of his views on the appropriateness of
GPL vs BSD vs other licenses for achieving various aims, "free
software" under the GNU meaning, vs crypto software deployment.  I
found Perrys summary to be the clearest on the topic so far.
You appear to be arguing with another aim in mind.  You seem to be
arguing that the primary goal should be to have best security, from
the outset.  ie one gets the impression from reading your previous two
posts that you consider ultimate security more important than
deployment.  If this is what you are saying, I disagree.
As I argued further down, I think cypherpunk type goals are better met
my getting people to deploy first, then if they bodge it to encourage
them to fix it, and I gave the example of the Netscape RNG weakness
which was very quicly fixed once it was found:
Which is not in the least condescending or irrelevant as it gives an
example showing that having what turns out to be less than perfect
security can be fairly quickly remedied.  And security is hard, even
competent people make mistakes.  The important thing is to admit and
quickly fix such mistakes.
I've taken your comments on web spoofing to another post.
I don't think anyone suggesed that closed source deployment was in
anyway better than open source, and obviously open source is better
for verifying the quality of crypto software.
However, as was previously suggested, if deployment is the goal, and
if one uses for example a GNU license it tends to discourage
commercial (typically closed source) deployers, and as Lucky said:
: Many companies will not be able to source contaminated by GNU-style
: licensing restrictions. Consequently, alternatives would be
: found. Some of those alternatives, include using no crypto at all or
: using crypto written by somebody that does not understand
: crytography.  Hardly the outcome a Cypherpunk would desire.
And I think at this stage something is vastly better than nothing.
Cool, what application area are these in?  Got a URL?
Just a comment on the Rick Smith (of Secure Computing) syndrome (read
crytopgraphy list you'll know about the book he wrote, because every
other post he makes involves it).  Perhaps not appropriate in your
case, but if people mention software, it is nice to know some details:
why should we be interested in your software etc.
Irony?  Your post was intended to be ironic?  What is ironic about
arguing that first cut security is more important than deployment?

aren't too delicate about it -- welcome to the cypherpunks list.

As to your web spoofing comments, (which I just read, see:
) this is a specific instance of the mapping problem, ie. how do you
know that the web page you ended up at belongs to the company you
heard about, or found by a web search or hypertext link on someones
page.  The hierarchical CA model says that you believe it is so
because the CA tells you it is so.
(Franks comment on the (in)security of following an unsecured
hypertext link was that the unsecured hypertext reference could be
modified in an active attack to point to their own (secured) page, and
then accept your payment instead of the company you intended to buy
Netscape 4 behaves in the following way, depending on the situation.
1) the site is using a cert signed by a CA the browser does not
In this case it shows you through a nice series of dialog box (in
microsofts wizard style), which is quite useful in explaining the
2) the site is using a cert signed by a CA the browser does recognise
In this case the browser does one of two things depending on whether
you are currently viewing a secure page, or not:
a) from insecure page shows dialog box telling you you are visiting a
secured page, and to click security for more info (clicking security
will show you the cert content, company name, CA details).
b) from secure page shows _nothing_, just goes right into the page
without further comment!  (default setup, freshly installed netscape
4.04 / linux).
(I tried this going from c2net, then typing in cypherpunks.to (Lucky's
site)), if you do click on security button you then get the cert info
    Cypherpunks Jihad
  Cypherpunks Tonga
  Cyberspace, none, TO
Part b) I view as a problem because it doesn't even by default show
you anything.  They could at least present the click through.  They
seem to be treating the secure / insecure as a binary state.
Could someone verify this in later revisions of netscape?
The basic problem though is that even if you do the `nagging dialog
box' click throughs with option to disable, chances are most people
will disable them, because they will get annoyed.
The simplest way to reduce this risk would be for a company to secure
all of it's web pages.  But this isn't going to do that much, because
people often don't know the web page URL.  (Frank notes all this).
Also spoofed company names which look similar to companies in real
life also are possible, for example there was a case of a BT Telekom
or something trying to spoof customers into parting with their money.
This is a problem with gullible consumers.
But if people started from print media advertisement, and typed in the
URL and the URL was signed by a CA then they are at least as secure as
the non-net situation.
In general though, I think there is a solution to this problem:
encrypt all the pages.
The other hard problem is now that you know you are visiting the web
page of FooBar Inc, as attested by Thawte (or whoever), how do you
know that FooBar won't take your money and run.  This is a general
reputation question, with the normal solutions.  If it's an expensive
item, you perhaps check them out, ask around for others experiences,
check with any reputation ratings services (trade groups, etc).

This is as others have noted cisco's doorbelling approach to GAK --
having routers and automated systems doing decryption, and allowing
LEA either direct access (possibly in this case), or access via
complicit operators.
One question which might help determins just how bad this Web TV thing
is, is does it use the forward secret ciphersuites.
If it did use FS ciphersuites, if the LEA starts reading traffic after
some point (by asking the WebTV operators to do so, or by using a
special LEA operator mode), he can't get all old traffic.
The EDH (ephemeral DH) modes are forward secret because a new DH key
is generated for each session.
Some of the RSA modes are forward secret, but only on export grade RSA
key sizes (512 bit).
As it got export permission, I fear the worst.  Perhaps even special
LEA operator access.

This is all important, I agree.  Many cypherpunks type coding efforts
end up being usuable only by unix hackers, or whatever.  eg Magic

@_subject: overlapping aims -- cypherpunks/FSF (Re: Two? ways people could use your code) 
I see this as a two separate, overlapping aims thing.
Aim 1, get lots of crypto out there, quality a secondary issue.
Motivation: try to ensure enough people use and know about crypto, so
that enough people understand how objectionable it is when governments
try to outlaw crypto.  Of course encourage use of strong crypto,
published, unpatented algorithms, and published source code where this
doesn't interfere with deployment.
Aim 2, try to encourage people to publish all source code.
Motivation: to give end-users more flexibility, and more freedom to do
what they want and change as they want the software they use.  I use
almost exclusively linux myself by choice.
Most deployed crypto is commercial, most used software is commercial.
(Insert proprietary instead of commercial if this makes it clearer
what I mean).
Therefore it seems to me that successes in getting crypto put in
commercial software which would not otherwise be there are important.
Your average linux/unix/GNU hacker is well above average in technical
competence, and can look after himself.  He can get the source for
pgp, check it to some extent, and understand the issues.  He is not
the target for the deployment.
The target for deployment is the mass market end-user (think windows95
users).  At present it is a statement of reality that most end-users
are using windows95.
Surreptitious company inserted unpublished back doors are rare I
think, much more likely is crypto-incompetence leading to
unintentional weakness.  Cypherpunks also have had some successes in
cracking weak systems as a way to encourage the vendors to fix the
problems.  Encouraging open source, and published protocols,
especially for crypto components is a good idea as it encourages peer
The secret doors we are concerned to fight against are being
engineered by governments.  Usually they are out in the open (clipper,
KRAP, etc).
GNU GPL not a bad way to further these two goals simultaneously, but I
think BSD (or I think you say that X11 license is better) is better
for the purpose.
Or GNU LGPL (Library GPL) I think is a good compromise position: it
allows use in proprietary software without requiring the rest of the
code to be GNU GPLed, and it encourages free access to the crypto
portion (if we are talking about crypto libraries and tools).
Would you be interested in publishing GNUPG, and other GNU crypto
utilities and libraries under GNU LGPL?  And adopting this for crypto
code as a general GNU strategy?  There are other libraries, so it
should qualify.  (Tom Zerucha wrote a OpenPGP implementation using
SSLeay, and I think said he would public domain his software).

"Contrary to one famous philosopher,
you're saying the medium is not the
message," Judge Thomas Nelson said,
alluding to the media theorist Marshall
McLuhan.   Bullshit!
  The bits and bytes of email encryption are a clear message
that I wish to exercise my right to speak freely, without those
who wish to do me harm invading my privacy.
  The death of strong encryption on the InterNet will be the
global death of free speech on the InterNet. Accordingly, I feel it is necessary to make a stand and declare that I stand
ready and willing to fight to the death against anyone who
takes it upon themselves to try to imprison me behind an
ElectroMagnetic Curtain.
  This includes the Ninth Distric Court judges, if they come to
the conclusion that the government that they represent needs to
electronically imprison their citizens 'for their own safety.'
The problem: Criminals with a simple
encryption program can scramble their data
beyond even the government's ability to read it.   Fuck the lame LEA pricks who whine about not being able to
stop someone bringing in a planeload of drugs without being
able to invade the privacy of every person on the face of
the earth.
  Am I supposed to believe that I have knowledge of when and
where major drug shipments are taking place, simply by virtue
of hanging out as a musician, yet the LEA's are incapable of
finding out the same information by being competent in their
profession? Barf City...

"Why are you saying that the fact that [encryption]
is functional takes it out of the First Amendment
context?" Myron Bright, one of the judges, asked
the Justice Department attorney, who was still in
mid-sentence. He answered that the regulations
were not aimed at suppressing speech, but only at
the physical capacity of encryption to thwart
government intelligence gathering.   The Spanish language has the same "physical capacity." So does (:>), (;[), and {;-|). Likewise, BTW, FWIW, FYI, and
my own personal favorite, YMMV (You Make Me Vomit? --or--
Your Mileage May Vary?). <-- Ambidextrous encryption.
  An-cay e-way pect-exay ig-pay atin-lay usts-bay of   Whispering also has the "physical capacity" to "thwart government intelligence gathering."
  When does the bullshit stop? When do we stop making the
use of the Spanish language over the InterNet illegal?
When do we stop making whispering, pig-latin, anagrams
and acronyms illegal?
  When do we stop saying that our government is such a
piece of crap that it is a danger to let its citizens
communicate freely, in private, and share their private
thoughts with one another?
At one point Fletcher called the government's case   Only because her mom taught her that it was unladylike to
say "Bullshit!"
In arguments Monday, a Justice Department
lawyer, Scott McIntosh, said the government's
intent was to preserve the ability of intelligence
agencies to eavesdrop on foreign governments
and citizens.   Let's see if I have this right...
  The U.S. government needs to destroy the right to free speech and right to privacy of its own citizens in order to infringe
upon the human rights of the governments and citizens of other
countries? Countries which already have strong encryption?
Countries like Red China, which is currently engaged in encryption research with an American company who got permission
to export much more diverse encryption material (after making
a huge campaign donation to the Whitehouse) than Professor
Bernstein will ever likely share with others?

reason to fear persecution by Facist, Nazi motherfuckers.

 going to all of the trouble of acting in a manner that will

I send electronically over the InterNet, both publically
and privately. I will fight to the bandwidth death against
anyone who wants to deny me my right to express my opinions
and access the opinions of those who also wish to express
their own opinions and share their true thoughts with their
fellow humans.
  If the ElectronicMagnetic Curtain slams down around me, then I will have no choice but to continue my current fight

  And I am not alone...

a) I tried fetching the key the message was encrypted to (try to
decrypt it -- it will tell you what keyid you need) from a keyserver
b) I noticed that the public key I fetched is the 384 bit blacknet key
which Paul Leyland broke (clue was the key on the keyservers is
revoked, and only 384 bits, which made me remember Leyland's
factoring attack),
c) used altavista to find Leyland's announce to sci.crypt a few years
back which included the private key he obtained by factoring the 384
bit blacknet public key
d) decrypted the message with the blacknet private key, e) inside the message was a public and private key, at this point
whoopee yet another Toto key (post 1), f) wondered if this key was the one which signed the messages the IRS
has incarcerated CJ over, checked the signature, yes! (post 2),
g) tried to sign a message with the key -- oops it has a password
because the private key is encrypted, h) tried the passwords that John Young forwarded to the list a few
weeks back from some anonymous source, yup one of them decrypts the

he used a `digital dead drop' -- encrypted with Blacknet's key and

intentionally) used the weak 384 bit Blacknet key which Paul Leyland's

Perhaps you understood that, but what you wrote (son of Gomer Blacknet
key?) was confusing.
This is similar to the time-delay crypto proposals made by Tim May and
more lately David Wagner, (and some other authors who I forget, I
think Schneier).  One of the time-delay crypto protocols is to encrypt
the information one wants to a time-delayed release of with weak
encryption requiring the approximate amount of time you wish to delay
to break.
'Course it doesn't work in general because it depends entirely on the
resources of the attacker.  Really you need a third party to publish
private keys at delayed intervals.
But for your suggested applicatoin -- plausible deniability for
`speaking truth to kings' -- it works fine, because that's the point,
plausible deniability against well resourced attackers (you are in
trouble if well resourced attackers are interested in you anyway), but
some value to the signature for low resourced attackers.
Other ways to provide plausible deniability is to not sign public
posts, and to use non-transferable signatures for private email.

I am noticing the odd free email2fax "your fax was sent successfully"
report in the dud messages sent to (the non-replyable)
nobody at remailer.ch.
Warming to the heart that -- anonymous fax.
Now I am wondering what the coverage is like on fax gateways -- it
clearly only is going to work in places where there are free local
calls, for numbers counting as local to the gateway.
Just thinking it would be kind of nice if one could send a message
via mixmaster and have it sort out the delivery if possible to
mail2fax gateways operating with local calls in that area code.
(Analogously perhaps to the auto USENET posting from those remailers
with this option turned on -- that is either direct (remailer posts)
or indirect (forwarded to a mail2news gateway)).
Has anyone come across any mail2fax site which tries to keep track of
other free fax services and forward faxes to one in the right area?
('Course if we could get some damn working ecash, we could fax it
anywhere -- sender pays:-)
Next stage -- anonymous voice mail delivered via voice modem /
soundcard, all via mixmaster, that would be nice!

@_subject: FYI: More on WebTV security 
Hope you are doing sensible things with RC4 -- sounds like you/webTV
group know what you are doing, but we have seen a lot of dumb things
done with RC4 by microsoft (and by others) in the last couple of
years.  Things like using the same key multiple times (doh!) etc.
Only it is worrying that they would refuse SSL (which is presumably
going to be 128 bit RC4) and make you design another SSL-alike
replacement which uses the same cipher and key size.  Perhaps they are
hoping that you will make subtle errors in a non-peer reviewed
protocol.  As you have given them your protocol spec (they require
this, so I presume you have), it may be that your export permission
hinges on a exploitable flaw they have found.  SSL went through a few
revisions before it got to be very secure.
The other crucial point is this: do you use a forward secret key
negotation alogrithm?  So that a court ordered demand for decryption
definately only gets traffic from that point onwards (and not all
traffic going backwards if the LEA has been unofficially recording all
the traffic to the user / all users).
Will look at those, thanks.
That's a strong claim.  I don't think you provide as much privacy as
say Infonex (pay with cash, no ID required), ssh, use a nymserver,
anonymous web pages etc.  There are a few others with similar offers
I wonder -- do you archive mail?  (As it goes in the clear through
your mail hub which the users are connecting to.)
It does seem to be somewhat of a relaxation, and is potentially useful
at that.  For example Phil Karn said Qualcomm where refused use of
3DES between their US and an non-US office with only their own staff
using it, though this was a few years ago.
In all I am very pleased to see this being discussed.  Microsoft as a
norm does not get involved in answering it's critics (in other than
carefully spun press releases).

@_subject: so, what did Toto *do*, exactly to get locked up? (Re: rules of engagement 
Fuck no.  Just fight smart.  Don't do dumb things which make you a
target for other than things you are immediately interested in
Toto is on occasion an inspiration.  I like Toto's attitude, it rocks,
his "FuckYouNess" or whatever he would call it is awesome.  As long as
all he is doing is tapping away behind a keyboard, the coherent
version of Toto rules at caustic rants.
I was just saying that it is smarter to fight one fight at a time.
Crypto-anarchy provides a generic solution to problems of increasingly
facist governments.  Getting yourself locked up for uninteresting
things does not further your interests.
It is difficult to tell exactly why Jim was incarcerated because the
IRS people may have alternate motives.  However, I suspect Jim Bell's
woes are more to do with involvement with the fake courts, and the use
of real IRS employees names and addresses, which was then taken to be
an immediate threat, taken with the AP rant printout they found in his
car.  I presume in reality he just collected the addresses to have the
fake court serve them with some legal documents.  I also presume the
reason the IRS first got interested in Jim was due to tax evasion,
and/or fake court documents addressed to IRS agents.
Toto is more interesting.  He seems to have been incarcerated because
he tried to stick up for Jim Bell.  What did he do?  Set up an AP bot
mockup, put the same IRS employees names, and a judge (I presume the
judge that handled Jim's case) on the page with $ amounts beside them.
The IRS became aware of Toto because they came across him via
investigation of Jim Bell.  (more on Toto below).
Also what I am saying is that it makes it hard to defend people if
they have done any number of dumb things which are the ostensible
reason they are locked up.  To defend Jim, you would have to defend
fake courts, fake social security numbers to avoid taxation, stink
bombs, and convince them that the collection of IRS employee names and
addresses had nothing to do with the AP rant.  If he had just been
ranting about AP, they never would have even bothered him, or if they
had, I think he would have had much more support.  Perhaps even the
EFF could have been interested.
I'd be interested in opinions on why they locked up Toto.  The legal
docs John Young obtained and put on up on the web (look at the bottom
of  cryptome page for `Carl Johnson'), says that it
is because he made a threat.
What about the following excerpt from the Toto post below could be
construed to constitute a danger, or did Toto get locked up because he
walked right up to the IRS and said "Fuck You", and "here I am come
and get me".
I have inserted the odd comment.  Anyone like to comment on how likely
a case by the IRS based on this post by `Toto' is to stick?  The AP
bot mockup I think was clearly not a credible threat, it was
completely non-functional.

Sending threats to president at whitehouse.gov however rhetorical is a
sure-fire way to get an immediate visit from men in dark suits.
However that has nothing to do with the IRS.  And the "threat" appears
to be an expression of annoyance with the government, and a possibly a
general prediction rather than any kind of specific threat:
:   "You can fuck some of the people all of the time, and all of

Rhetoric, word play on quote "you can fool all of the people some of
the time, some of the people all of the time, but not all of the
people all of the time".
:   Am *I* going to whack you out? Maybe...
Sounding a bit more specific there, though it is only a "Maybe...",
and the following literary quotes suggest he is more ranting than
anything.  People on list have suggested that it is better to vent anger with
unspecific third person comments "They ought to be taken out and
shot", "they should be the first against the wall come the
revolution".  But I am not up to speed on the legal issues here.
It seems likely as a whole that Toto is just ranting.  And surely once
they have pulled him in they have to show some actual credible plan.
Mere ranting about officials I presume is not grounds for locking
people up.

Toto's MeatSpace "actions" to date seems to have been symbolic.  The

Some people have been talking about using passwords as private keys.
(By using the passphrase as seed material for regenerating the private

I don't think this is a good idea.
You can't forget passphrases.  You can destroy private key files.
Therefore you open yourself up to coercion, and forward secrecy is not
possbile with these schemes.  This means it is less secure.
The other reason it is less secure others commented on: you provide an

Depends if the discrete log attack anonymous used works over elliptic

signature scheme James is using.
Anonymous wrote on his attack:
: N is the product of two primes, but each p-1 has about 16 small
: prime factors (about 25-35 bits) to allow calculating the discrete
: log efficiently.  With this choice of primes it took about three
: hours to run the discrete log.
in otherwords n is 1024 bit, p and q 512 bit, p1..p16, q1..q16 are
about 25-35 bits each:
then he can take discrete logs modulo n.  With this given signature s
on message m with unpublished public key, he can compute a public and
private exponent e, d which could have signed message m:
and	m = s ^ e mod n
so compute discrete log of m mod n in base s to compute an e.  Then
compute a d using the normal: If something like this worked on Kong's signatures, you would need two
signatures, or a signature on a message together with a signed public
key.  Does Kong use self signed public keys?

Let me start with the disclaimer since I am going to vehemently disagree
with you - These are my own opinions and in no way reflect my companies or
our clients Opinions, etc. etc. etc. -
So William - IMHO, you are missing the point totally. The IETF is an
A-Political Organization investing in the development of technical standards
to accomplish various networking services. As to the issue of Politic vs.
Technology, by its actions alone, KRAP's demonstrated agenda with the IETF
is purely technical and whether it is in furtherance of its external
political agenda is really irrelevant to the IETF as and its established
process as a whole.
with the dissolving of anonymity through Key Recovery and Government's
ability to look at data that flows over a network. Remember also that it was
the Government that was the primary subsidizer of said same network and
everything that evolved the old 56k ARPANET into what the Public Internet is
As another side issue, the other potentially-viable argument is that
ISAKMP/IKE is so far along in its process of becoming a standard, that
adding a late draft impedes the value of the work already done - Essentially
that these folks  (KRAP) have essentially slipped a whammy onto the stack.
Is it your view that this implies that because of this later posting that
the material will be exempt from the general scrutiny that the previous
components of ISAKMP/IKE have been through - I don't think so... This crowd
loves to do the Pit-Bull thang and shred the submitted concepts to glean the
technical truth therein. If this is the issue then the answer is to work
within the existing framework and to submit a public motion to the WG to
freeze the ISAKMP last call efforts so that they exclude the new draft until
such time as it (the GAK extensions) can undergo further scrutiny.
As to the issue of the addition itself being out of line because of its late
entrance into the standards arena relative to the last call and all that-
Again, I disagree as to what and how - There are numerous "standard
processes" in place that allow for this as well and that here in the real
world, use of this ability is a very common practice. Look for instance at
what happened to the last TAX REFORM effort with the addition of Senator
Moyniham's SS1706 Rider, or as another example look at what congress as a
whole did with the HIPAA legislation (
and its embedded "legal penalties" for unauthorized  disclosure of health
data. Since this case is specific to the bulk distribution of data, it
really applies directly to IT Directors and their staff. heck, imagine that
your insurance Co.'s or hospital's  IT folks could actually go to jail by
the statute set here. Again here we are at the bottom line and if this is
the thing you are objecting too then you need to object to the process not
the event itself.
As to the perversion commentary specifically... perversion is a moral issue
and is not addressed by the IETF rules (RFC2026 in particular). My
suggestion is that if you feel this is a problem that you address it at the
POISSON WG level rather than in IPSEC or PKIX since it is a process problem,
and that under the currently in-place operating rules, this thing, the
filing of a new proposed component of the ISAKMP protocol is OK to do.

[What company do you work for?  You disclaim about your "company" and

I understood it this way: that IETF policy is not allow political
considerations to weaken or otherwise damage security functions in
IETF standards.  eg. No weak key lengths for to satisfy local
government politics etc.
Read RFC 1984.  I quote:
: KEYS SHOULD NOT BE REVEALABLE
: :    The security of a modern cryptosystem rests entirely on the secrecy
:    of the keys.  Accordingly, it is a major principle of system design
:    that to the extent possible, secret keys should never leave their
:    user's secure environment.  Key escrow implies that keys must be
:    disclosed in some fashion, a flat-out contradiction of this
:    principle.  Any such disclosure weakens the total security of the
:    system.
: : DATA RECOVERY
: :    Sometimes escrow systems are touted as being good for the customer
:    because they allow data recovery in the case of lost keys. However,
:    it should be up to the customer to decide whether they would prefer
:    the more secure system in which lost keys mean lost data, or one in
:    which keys are escrowed to be recovered when necessary.  Similarly,
:    keys used only for conversations (as opposed to file storage) need
:    never be escrowed.  And a system in which the secret key is stored by
:    a government and not by the data owner is certainly not practical for
:    data recovery.
This quoted point is kind of relevant here:
 "keys used only for conversations (as opposed to file storage) need
  never be escrowed"
Now we move on to your GAK apologist arguments...
"Government" is composed of public servants.  This citizen-unit

It would seem that Toto's tendency for magical thinking, and his
theories on `synchronicity' are contagious, and that the FBI agent
ended up being drawn into Toto's magical thinking, conspiracy theory

Most of Toto's messages were fictional works such as `WebWorld', and
the others, cynical rants, conspiracy theories, etc.  No one here had
the faintest idea that any of this stuff was connected with reality.
One wonders about the Xenix chainsaw massacre, and the suitcase
nuke... fact or fiction :-)

Anonymous notes:
Would you happen to recall the subject field or approximate date of
this message?  (It's kind of difficult to search for Toto posts on various topics
because the From line is mostly forged, via a remailer, or forged as
coming from a remailer.  Ditto for the author, using a different nym
each time: TruthMongrel, DeathMonger, etc.)
The collection of Toto's keys that he did post and the date he posted
might be useful to archive at jya.com so that we can see which if any
of Gordon's claims of proof of authentic Toto messages are valid.

@_subject: Toto describing a visit from SS agents 
Again while searching for keys, another encrypted message (Subject:
Secret Service With A Smile - SAHMD!!! / Pwd: lco, Date: 31 Jul 98)
this message appears to refer to a visit from US Secret Service
agents, apparently due to their imputing some kind of threat to US
president(?) in one of Toto's rants.
Decrypted copy below [1].
Secret Service With A Smile - SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!!
  It was only natural for me to wonder what it was about the Secret
Service Agents who visited me today that enabled them to act like
decent, pleasant people during the course of the personal interview
portion of their investigation into my life and psyche.
  The question was answered, to my satisfaction, at the point when
the more veteran of the two agents explained that, despite my
rugged handsomeness and my delightful personality, they would have
to CrushMeLikeABug if it became apparent to them that my already
tentative physical and mental existence came into conflict with
their official duty to protect the President of the United States.
  I realized that they were professionals, with a high degree of
integrity, and that their concern probably went far beyond the
fact that if the Nation lost the CommanderInChief on their shift,
they could pretty much kiss their Christmas Bonus goodbye...
  It was also apparent that their ability to be quite reasonable
and pleasant human beings--while making it plain that informing me
that putting me away for observation in Springfield, Missouri,
could easily take away a full year of my life, was *meant* to be
a threat--without having to engage in a heavy-handed affectation
of MachoAuthority, was the result of their actually *having* the
authority to decide, here and now, whether or not my life would
instantly become a living hell.
  The Secret Service Agents were also extremely intelligent, not
even blinking before passing on my offer to testify against myself,
in return for immunity from prosecution.
 (When I made the same offer to RCMP OffalSlurs, they had to   contact their superiors, who held a meeting with OffalSchills
  behind the closed doors of the Canadian Justice Apartment,
  before finally declining my offer.)
  I was able to relax and be cooperative in dealing with the Agents, since, when your fate is in the hands of someone with
GenuineAuthority, whether their intentions are GoodOrEvil (TM)
is not nearly as important as to whether or not they happen to
be StupidFucks (TM) who can ruin your life over something as
simple as misunderstanding your request that they make their
questions more 'lucid.'
 ("That's it, you sick, fucking pervert! Jim, get the kilo of
  heroin out of the trunk...")
Wrong Question  When Dealing With StupidFucks:
  "Excuse me, but do your employers *know* that you carry a gun?
I mean, have they ever met you, or were you hired by mail? Can
you actually shoot a gun without moving your lips?"
  Although the Secret Service Agents were in possession of an
email I had sent a few minutes or hours previously, from Pima
College -->  (who I immediately tried to Rat
Out as the leader of a ChildSexRingDedicatedToTheViolentOver
ThrowOfTheUSGovernment, in order to save my own skin), the
agents seemed much more interested in a chapter of SAHMD!!!
which contains notification of an OfficialDeathThreat to pretty
much DoGodAndEverybodyOnTheFaceOfTheEarth.
  I tried to placate them by reaching over with a pen and adding
an 'Un' in front of the word 'Official,' but they were not really
impressed, informing me that the point they were trying to make
had to do with it being unacceptable, from their point of view,
for me to use the words 'Death,' 'Threat,' and 'President' all
in the same paragraph, let alone all in the same sentence.
{"Well, excuuusssee *me*!"}
  Realizing that it was probably not an opportune moment to try to
hit them up for a donation toward the maintenance of my planned
PresidentialDeathThreatAnonymousRemailer, I casually turned the
donation jar so that they couldn't see the label, and I set it
  Actually, I couldn't be certain that I had actually written the
chapter, or portion thereof, with which the agents seemed most
concerned, since I find it difficult to distinguish between the
work that is mine alone, and the work that is a collage of various
participants in the writing and dissemination of 'The True Story
of the InterNet' manuscripts, if I don't have access to the files
on the computer on which they were created and stored.
  Nonetheless, I refrained from pointing out that the phrase that
indicates that the writer "might" conceivably "whack" someone or
another GovernmentPersonage, might equally apply to the stance
taken by the Secret Service Agents, themselves, if the Founding
Fathers were to be believed when they indicated that it is the
right and the duty of the citizenry to take up arms against their
rulers, if need be, in the interest of Democracy, Freedom, Justice,
or in DivineRetribution against the High&Mighty if they take a drink
out of your beer while you're in the restroom, having a leak.
 (I'm not certain about that last example, but I have no doubt that
  the Founding Fathers *meant* to include that...)
  I refrained from attempting to engage the Agents in philosophical
debate in regard to some of the finer points surrounding the issues
of Freedom of Speech, since the purpose of their visit was obviously
geared toward impressing upon me the duties encompassed by their job
description, their professional competence in doing their job, and
the fact that the necessity of making a return visit would very
likely be an indication that Uncle Sam was about to become my new
  To tell the truth, I was in a pretty scattered state of mind at
the time of their visit, and I undoubtedly failed to adequately
understand a good portion of the dialogue which took place, but
they were very clear in explaining that, given my current state
of unwelcomeness in Canada, I am running out of countries to go
to, and that I should give serious consideration as to whether or
not I wanted my next Literary Spamology to be titled, "Midnight Express II."
  Hhhmmm...decisions, decisions...
  Since my reading of the Secret Service Agents is that they are
highly ethical professionals, with little need to persecute an
individual out of thin-skinned, personal vindictiveness, I guess
it wouldn't hurt to mention that, minutes after their departure,
Linda Lou arrived home, announcing that there was yet another
Tarantula in the driveway, headed toward the house...
  The obvious conclusion, of course, is that the Secret Service
Agents are actually Reptilian Nazis, who are deeply involved in
the WorldWidePlotAgainstMe.
  This, in turn, leads to the dilemma of whether or not I should,
on the occasion of a return visit, jump them and drive wooden stakes
through their hearts, turning them into quivering pools of smoking,
green slime.  (Or is that Vampires? Shit! I'd better check, first, or it could
  lead to a really embarassing situation.)
  On the other hand, since they were quite civil and reasonable
in their dealings with me, and they apparently didn't eat any of
the dogs, while here (although it might have been a different
story, if we had poodles), then perhaps their is a chance that
we and the Reptilian Nazis can live together in peace...unless it
is a SneakyTrick (TM), of course...and they are trying to *confuse*
me, so that I don't warn TheOthers...and they were only so pleasant
because they were inwardly laughing at me for not realizing that,
starting tomorrow, they are going to take control of the whole face
of the globe, turning all humans into LobotomizedSlaves who exist
only to serve their ReptilianNaziMasters!
QUICK, EVERYBODY! ARM YOURSELVES AND RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!
PREPARE TO ENGAGE THE REPTILIAN NAZIS IN VIOLENT, BLOODY STRUGGLE!
START BY WHACKING OUT THE LAWYERS, AND THEN...
  Hold it! What the fuck am I ranting on about?
  The Masses are *already* LobotomizedSlaves who exist only to serve
their ReptilianNaziMasters...
  Maybe the agents were just here to see whether or not Baby is a
  That makes more sense, since the Reptilian Nazis don't really give a FatRat'sAss about the Jews, but they *do* want to round up
all of the poodles shortly before the arrival of their Reptilian
Nazi Relatives, so that there is plenty of barbeque at their
  Yeah, that's gotta be it...
  Actually, I'm rather glad that the Secret Service Agents dropped
around to meet me in person, since people reading my copious literary
effluvia sometimes mistakenly get the impression that I am some kind
of Dogamned Weirdo, or something.
  Still, I wish I had been able to refrain from going, "Cuckoo-Cuckoo"
on the hour and the half-hour during their vist.
  But, what the hell...I bet that a *lot* of the people they visit
do that...

This is a good time to remind RCMP Officers across Canada that, despite our
long history of exercising a strong hand (and an even stronger nightstick
;?) in keeping the Wagon-Burners from storming the gates of white society,
current social and legal trends make it necessary for us to take every step
necessary to cover our ass when we take those measures needed to keep them
in their proper physical place (the reservation) and to keep them in their
proper attitudinal place even when they remain in their proper physical
Remember that the procedures that we have put in place are for your
protection, and that if you stay within our guidelines, you can pretty much
waste as many Wagon-Burners as you wish, without suffering legal
Constable Voller followed proper procedure in charging right into a
volatile situation with no backup, so that there would be no possibility of
conflicting stories from other officers invited to participate in the
adrenaline high involved.
He also had the foresight to waste the bitch with a shotgun, so that a wide
enough target area would be covered to take care of any potential witnesses
whose stories would not be subject to government pressure as to their
Rest assured that if you murder a Wagon-Burner according to proper
procedure, that the members we claim not to be able to spare to supervise a
potentially deadly encounter with Wagon-Burners will suddenly become
available to pore over the murder site and absolve you of any wrongdoing.
A host of spin-doctors will also suddenly appear to remind the head
Wagon-Burners that 'good relations' with the Federal Government are
conditional on 'going along to get along.'
The RCMP Officers of the Wild, Wild West continue to lead the way in
keeping the Wagon-Burners constantly on the run, no matter how far they run
to try to escape.
The Estevan Detachment of the RCMP is living up to their long tradition of
effectively using other arms of law enforcement to effectively harass
Wagon-Burners while using a minimum of Federal resources.
You undoubtedly remember last year's article about the member of the City
of Estevan Police Department who was successful in getting the courts to
uphold his own brand of Frontier Justice for decades, until he made the
mistake of using a 'real' informant, thus making his cases vulnerable to
conflicting testimony as to his questionable activities.
As we reported, the prosecutor was able to railroad a couple of kids who
were represented by incompetent legal aide lawyers, by having the arresting
officer help to mentally muscle them outside the presence of legal counsel,
but the  Wagon-Burner on the local yokel's list was not able to be
railroaded at that time.
We reported with pride on the Estevan Detachment of the RCMP helping that
same local officer to once again set up the Wagon-Burner by helping in the
operation while staying out of the main action, so that the Wagon-Burner
and his White-Whore Wife were financially broken to the point where they
had to cop a plea.
Due to the Estevan Detachment's foresight, they didn't "get any on 'em"
when the local yokel finally got his chain yanked on bogus grounds that
protected the City of Estevan from taking any responsibility for his years
of abuse of authority.
To bring you up to date, not only is the Wagon-Burners oldest little
glue-sniffer currently being railroaded on criminal charges, but the
Estevan RCMP are once again setting a fire under the Wagon-Burner's ass by
supporting the Provincial Game Warden's persecution of the Wagon-Burner for
daring to hunt on the land that we stole from him, once again saving
Federal dollars from having to be used to finance their dirty work.

Advocates, but I was not a Freedom of Speech Advocate, so I did not speak

@_subject: CHALLENGE? Toto/signature attack w. unpublished public key 
This post discusses the possibility of generating a RSA public key n,
and e given a signature s on a message m creating using an unknown
(unpublished) n and e.  A message and signature whose validity has
some bearing on a current IRS investigation is given as a target for
an attack if such an attack is feasible.
Toto published one signed message [1] but not a public key for the
signature.  It seems to me that there should be other public keys
which one could generate which could have signed the same message.
I would like comments on the feasibility of the signature attack
proposed below, and suggestions for more efficient methods.
(For those not following the Toto saga, he was the author of a series
of anti-government rants and future fiction stories on cypherpunks.
The posting of [1] to the list seems to have been deemed a handy
excuse for the IRS to arrange Carl Johnson's incarceration See:
  They claim that the presence of a public
key on Carl Johnson's hard disk proves that he authored the post in
question [1].)
What we have is:
Unknowns: e, n, d
Knowns: m, s
Where m = padding || md5( message )
A signature is computed as:
and verified by checking that:
( where RSA says: n = p.q, d.e = 1 mod (p-1).(q-1) )
We are trying to find an n and an e which satisfy s ^ e mod n = m,
with the additional constraints that log2( n ) = 1024 and n > s
(because we have the signature s, and it is 1024 bits in length).
For bonus points it would be nice for n mod 2^64 = 0xCE56A4072541C535,
which is the key-id in the signature.  (I say bonus points because the
key-id in the signature is not authenticated, or included in the
message digest, so could have been for example edited after the
signature was made, or filled with random numbers for whatever
Tinkering with PGP I can extract the values for the knowns:
s =   0x08F4D5CBC10063725B206F787EB7370BBD0C5B4854CE79A9007D1801AEAEE6E6
m =   0x0001FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
(the 00 01 FF .. FF 00 are the PKCS required padding, then the
3020300c06082a864886f70d020505000410 is the ASN padding indicating
various PKCS  cruft, and 5A82A30F832DC6839C20DD6DB2EF783B is the
digest of the message (which includes some of the info in the
signature block: timestamp, signature type, etc))
So next we would like to solve:
or in other words find e, k and n st:
I have been trying to factor f3 = s ^ e - m for e = 3, and can get
f = 2 2 5 11 17 26496937
(I call the f resulting from choosing e = 3, f3, other e values can be
denoted f5, f7, etc).
It seems to me that if we can get get a factor out (or construct a
composite from factors) which is greater than s, and is 1024 bits
long, then this "key" could have signed the message in question.
If the number has 2 or more factors, which we know because we
constructed it by multiplying them, then we could even "sign" another
message with this key, by generating a d based on the p, q (and
possibly other multiples) and have both messages appear to be signed
by the same key.
If we can get some larger factors, we stand a chance because we have
the flexibility of being able to adjust a potentional n's size by
multiplying by combinations of factors found so far 5 11 17 26496937.
This means we can adjust n's size by adding bits by multiplying by
combinations as follows
combination		bits added
5			2 - 3
11			3 - 4
17			4
5 11			5 - 6
5 17			6 - 7
11 17			7 - 8
26496937		24 - 25
So the challenge is to find other factors of:
f =	251048771208077840279253039518619486761149393656018551881762776705901\
One could also try other values for e, although they result in larger
f.  What is the best factoring code available to have a go at factoring
the above?  (I have been usign the demo pollard-rho factoring code
which comes with ssh-1.2.26 in the gmp-2.0.2-ssh-2/demos directory).
Anyone interested to give this a go, who has say got a few (hundred?)
workstations already setup for another factoring challenge which they
could divert to attack the above f3 (or f5, f7, etc).
Course, if Toto is still at large, and Carl Johnson is not the only
one with the key (and some messages on cypherpunks recently lend
credence to this), he might trash this challenge by posting another
signed message, or weaken it's value by posting a public key which
proved could be shown to have been derived by this method.
(Interestingly, I think merely posting a public key claiming to be the
`real key' which we couldn't factor nor show to be a factor of f
wouldn't prove that that key was any more legitimate than a key
generated by a success on this challenge, all it would tend to show
would be that the person who posted it had more compute power
available than us!)

"Contrary to one famous philosopher,
you're saying the medium is not the
message," Judge Thomas Nelson said,
alluding to the media theorist Marshall
McLuhan.   Bullshit!
  The bits and bytes of email encryption are a clear message
that I wish to exercise my right to speak freely, without those
who wish to do me harm invading my privacy.
  The death of strong encryption on the InterNet will be the
global death of free speech on the InterNet. Accordingly, I feel it is necessary to make a stand and declare that I stand
ready and willing to fight to the death against anyone who
takes it upon themselves to try to imprison me behind an
ElectroMagnetic Curtain.
  This includes the Ninth Distric Court judges, if they come to
the conclusion that the government that they represent needs to
electronically imprison their citizens 'for their own safety.'
The problem: Criminals with a simple
encryption program can scramble their data
beyond even the government's ability to read it.   Fuck the lame LEA pricks who whine about not being able to
stop someone bringing in a planeload of drugs without being
able to invade the privacy of every person on the face of
the earth.
  Am I supposed to believe that I have knowledge of when and
where major drug shipments are taking place, simply by virtue
of hanging out as a musician, yet the LEA's are incapable of
finding out the same information by being competent in their
profession? Barf City...
 [I will shortly provide information for any LEA which wishes
  to prosecute me for my coming 'physical' death threat, on
  how to hunt me down like the filthy dog that I am.]
"Why are you saying that the fact that [encryption]
is functional takes it out of the First Amendment
context?" Myron Bright, one of the judges, asked
the Justice Department attorney, who was still in
mid-sentence. He answered that the regulations
were not aimed at suppressing speech, but only at
the physical capacity of encryption to thwart
government intelligence gathering.   The Spanish language has the same "physical capacity." So does (:>), (;[), and {;-|). Likewise, BTW, FWIW, FYI, and
my own personal favorite, YMMV (You Make Me Vomit? --or--
Your Mileage May Vary?). <-- Ambidextrous encryption.
  An-cay e-way pect-exay ig-pay atin-lay usts-bay of   Whispering also has the "physical capacity" to "thwart government intelligence gathering."
  When does the bullshit stop? When do we stop making the
use of the Spanish language over the InterNet illegal?
When do we stop making whispering, pig-latin, anagrams
and acronyms illegal?
  When do we stop saying that our government is such a
piece of crap that it is a danger to let its citizens
communicate freely, in private, and share their private
thoughts with one another?
At one point Fletcher called the government's case   Only because her mom taught her that it was unladylike to
say "Bullshit!"
In arguments Monday, a Justice Department
lawyer, Scott McIntosh, said the government's
intent was to preserve the ability of intelligence
agencies to eavesdrop on foreign governments
and citizens.   Let's see if I have this right...
  The U.S. government needs to destroy the right to free speech and right to privacy of its own citizens in order to infringe
upon the human rights of the governments and citizens of other
countries? Countries which already have strong encryption?
Countries like Red China, which is currently engaged in encryption research with an American company who got permission
to export much more diverse encryption material (after making
a huge campaign donation to the Whitehouse) than Professor
Bernstein will ever likely share with others?
  Apologies to Judge Fletcher, but that's not "puzzling." That's
the same-old-same-old Bullshit!
OFFICIAL 'PHYSICAL' DEATH THREAT!!!
  The pen is mightier than the sword. Thus, I prefer to wage my
'war to the death' against those who would stomp on my basic
human rights *"in the interests of National Security"* with my
electronic pen, on the InterNet, using encryption when I have
reason to fear persecution by Facist, Nazi motherfuckers.
[* ~~ TruthMonger Vernacular Translation ~~ "so that the  government can maintain its authority over the citizens
 by use of force and violation of human rights, rather than
 going to all of the trouble of acting in a manner that will
 garner the citizens' respect."]
  I will continue to express my thoughts through the words
I send electronically over the InterNet, both publically
and privately. I will fight to the bandwidth death against
anyone who wants to deny me my right to express my opinions
and access the opinions of those who also wish to express
their own opinions and share their true thoughts with their

As a result of my trawl through my cypherpunks archive last week
looking for publically posted private keys by Toto et al, I grepped
out a selection of encrypted messages sent to the list.  I thought I'd
have a go at decrypting these with the selection of passphrases John
Young posted earlier today, in case any were encrypted with the
publically posted keys, or with a conventional encryption key.
I came across this post [1] posted in 5 Sep 97 which contains this
encrypted message, and "challenge" to decrypt it.
Now if you try to decrypt it, it says you need key 0xE6A9C799, the
public key for which is on the key servers.  However keyids are
actually stored as 64 bits, internally to PGP messages, but only the
least significant 32 bits are displayed by PGP normally.  I use
pgpacket to look at things and it gives you all 64 bits, the message
has keyid:
however the key I got off the keyserver [2] has keyid:
which differs by 0x400000000000 or one bit.  That would require
knowing how to create a 0xdeadbeef key or at least use software to do
this, if it is available.
Unless the bit flip is part of the "challenge".  Who knows.
Toto did allude to hacking skills, though largely claimed ignorance.
I wonder if this was feigned, or if there are other Totos who are
doing the key hacks etc.  eg this challenge out of bureau42.ml.org
Toto is a one man computer crypto forensics persons full-employment
insurance! -- the amount of stuff posted to the list with various

knows crypto, or are going to be seriously confused at this point.

this was his aim.

The EFF doesn't have a copy of the correct answer locked away in
a secret underground cave in Tibet, for verification, because
the above Forged Encryption message is just a bunch of crap we
typed in pretty much at random.
Does the government want to keep your private key in escrow? Give
them a copy of your EFF private key.

when you give them to the government agent. Ask him how his day
has been. Offer him some coffe, and ask about his family. Tell him you will send him a Christmas card with another copy of your
EFF private key, just in case the government misplaces the copies
you gave them.
Put your hand over your heart, salute the flag, and sing "God Bless
America" as the government agent leaves. Then fart.
Use the EFF Forged Encryption sofware regularly, to send messages
with Subject:'s like "The Plot Against the PREZ," "Confirmation of
the date of our armed assault," "The Nuke has arrived."
Keep a copy of your EFF Forged Encryption secret key in a directory
named "Off the Pigs." Most importantly, never reveal in your private email to others that
you are a deaf, dumb and blind quadraplegic who has been homebound

The constraint I gave was that log(n) = 1024.  Bear in mind that the
msbyte of s = 0x08, so we know that n > s, and I think we know that n
< 2^1024 also based on the s padding from the signature. So based on
this n would be in the range 1020 - 1024 bits, right?
He has to factor your n to determine that it is bogus though?  This
would imply that he had more compute than you do.  (Not unreasonable
threat model mind).
Agree.  Weak counterpoint is that the keyid is not authenticated,
though if IRS have a key, they know it's keyid, and if that keyid is
the one posted (unauthenticated inside the armor 0xCE56A4072541C535),
this tips the probability of authorship towards the key they have.
This though is perhaps not incontroverible proof, if one posits that
Toto or unknown others were trying to create a complicated mess for
people to confuse themselves analysing.  Evidence suggests that this was/is the case: there are other messages,
for example one with a signature with what is perhaps a 0xdeadbeef
attack against a key on the keyservers, with the same 32 bit keyid,
but a 64 bit key id differing by 1 bit.  Another key which almost but
not quite makes sense to PGP (a few bits twiddled).  Plus lots of
still undecrypted encrypted messages posted to the list, plus possibly
stegoed images posted (one image was posted together with a password
which was also publically posted together with instructions for
recovering using S-TOOLS4.ZIP (a stego package for windows), and lots
of other anonymously and pseudonymously posted images.)
(One of the encrypted keys which passphrases were forwarded to the
list for just today had been posted to the list over a year ago --

Yes!  Excellent.  This construct (discrete logs over composite modulus
to allow the same operation) is used by the identity based crypto
people.  The trap door is not that good, because 512 bit discrete logs
are as you suggest rather expensive to compute.
It's not a hacked version of PGP, I've generated such keys myself
also: it is just a lesser documented feature of pgp2.x, (pgp -kg 1024
768) would give you a 1024 bit n and a 768 bit e).
Not so obvious with the other key tinkering which has been going on
here.  It seems likely that Toto et al were purposefully trying to sow
confusion, and seem to delight in leaving little clues to people
trying to understand it looks like this strategy has been operational
for over a year now (some of the encrypted messages which passphrases
were forwarded to the list for just today had been posted to the list
over a year ago -- Carl Johnson couldn't have posted the passphrase
because he is incarcerated).
Resources available: one low end pentium based linux PC? :-) Just that
the attack is clearly feasible is interesting though a demonstration
would be perhaps more convincing to less technically aware IRS people.
The biggest resource overhead is implementing that lot though, unless
there exist packages or libraries which already do most of it for you.
I think the answer to that is yes.
In connection with previous discussions of implementing forward
secrecy using identity based crypto (search archives for cypherpunks /
coderpunks /cryptography for posts with
) another Anonymous describes some of the identity based crypto papers
on this topic, which suggests another method of being able to compute
discrete logs mod composite n.
: Maurer describes an alternative set of parameters as well.  Rather than
: choosing small primes for the discrete logs, larger primes with a
: special form are used which make the problem easy.  This is based on the
: Pohlig-Hellman discrete log algorithm, which applies when p-1 has all small
: factors.  The problem is that there also exists a p-1 factoring algorithm
: which works when p-1 has all small factors.  However the former algorithm
: costs the square root of the size of the factors, while the later takes
: work proportional to the size of the factors themselves.  This gives a
: window where the discrete log can be done but the factoring will fail.
: : For this embodiment, Maurer suggests a modulus which is the product of
: two primes, each 100 digits (333 bits) in length.  This will produce
: a 666 bit modulus.  Have each of the primes be such that (p-1)/2 is a
: product of several 13-15 digit (43-50 bit) primes.
So it could be done, I think, and in such a way that you have lower
cpu overhead than the attacker trying to prove one key more likely
than the other.

A very interesting problem...
In addition it has to be that n is the right length based on the "s"
padding.  This limits it to an 8 bit range, in this case 1024-1031 bits.
There are two approaches here.  First, the one you are doing: try
different e values and factor s^e - m until you find one which looks
like it could be a plausible k * n.  The problem is that n is supposed
to be the product of two large primes, and if it is, you won't be able
to factor it.  So you might be able to create a public key which looks
reasonable, but you can't create a private key which does, one which is
a multiple of two large primes.  If you make n be a product of a bunch
of small primes, so that you can make signatures with it, then a third
party can detect this and know it is bogus.
Also, this approach won't match the keyid of the original signature.
Another approach is to generate an n such that the discrete logarithm
is solvable mod n.  Then you can solve for e in s^e = m mod n, with
the base of the discrete log being s.  Doing this you can match the
keyid and size of n without too much difficulty.
Unfortunately e will not be small; it will be about the same size as n.
There are one or two keys on the public keyring which have large e's,
apparently generated by hacked versions of pgp.  Some people feel
safer with random e than a small e.  So this could perhaps be accepted.
(OTOH given two keys that both sign the same message, one with a small
e and one with a large one, it is obvious that the first is the legit
one and the second is the cloned one.)
If you know the factorization of the size of the exponentiation group mod
n, and all the factors are small enough, you can solve the discrete log
problem mod n.  You solve the discrete log separately for each factor
and then combine the results.  With an RSA modulus, the group order is
LCM(p-1,q-1), or equivalently (p-1)(q-1)/GCD(p-1,q-1).  If you were able
to solve discrete logs mod p-1 and q-1 then you could solve discrete
logs mod n.
Unfortunately with a 1024 bit RSA modulus it is not going to be
feasible to solve 512 bit discrete logs using a reasonable amount
of effort.  However by using more factors in the RSA modulus it should
become practical.  The number of factors needed will depend on how much
resources you have to work on the discrete log.
Once you have your n and e you can sign other messages with the key.
The n looks OK from outside because the fact that it has more than two
factors is not detectable, as long as its factors are not too small.
Actually there may be a way of distinguishing n's with two factors from
n's with more, check into this.
Also check into whether n's of this form can be factored via a p-1
factoring attack.  It may be that making the discrete log easy also makes
the modulus factorable.

@_subject: CHALLENGE? Toto/signature attack w. unpublished public key 
I used PGP to make an m to match a 1024 bit n which I presumed from a
1024 bit s; s is from the signature packet from the signed post in
question.  I made the assumption that for a 1024 bit s, the padded
message digest m would be of size 1024 bit also, with it's leading 00
01 FF ... FF etc.  I see what you are saying: that if n had been even 1032 bits, it would
still be possible (though relatively unlikely) to result in a s <
1024, which would mean that the m I presumed could have had been a
byte longer.  I think your assumption that PGP would not encode the
leading 0 byte (in the s) is correct, from past PGP code tinkering.
In fact I guess that actually this statement generalises and (with an
even smaller probability) the n could have been 1040 bits, and the s
just happened to come out < 1024 bits, and so on.
I'll see if I can induce this effect by generating a 1025 bit key, and
seeing if any of the signatures come out at 1024 bits:
n =	0x0181291263B847EBEBFDC65E9128DDE9015522B461618F43CDBBF3D707507BA9
e =	0x11
s =	0x5AA544A471AA79074796D0C85BE01DF44BBED7F14C1189D2D114F8A4E9D4D20E
So yes, n = 1025 bits, and this particular s is 1023 bits, and this
one is 1025 bits:
s' =	0x012B4B5218E1173DCEF5525C3E9E72BA962371372DA9E9D8D1B469A3BD1060E1
(most of them work out to be < 1025 bits).
Yes, you are right.  Presented with two public keys (n,e), and (n',e') and a signature s,
that even if the attacker manages to factor n but not n' the attacker
can't prove that there isn't another public key (n'',e'') which is the
real key which signed the message.  Ie the reason the attacker is
unable to factor (n',e') may be either because it is a multiple of two
512 bit primes, or because it is a mutliple of primes of special form
I quoted a post describing in the other post, and he doesn't have
enough compute to recover it.  With the quoted algorithm from Maurer,
the attacker needs more compute to show that the key has a special
form than you do to create the key.

Munge signatures!?  He generated an RSA key pair to match the
pre-published signature based on generating primes of special form
and/or using multiple smaller primes to construct an n which he could
perform discrete logs in (plus a dead beef attack), and all you can
say is the above.  You should take you hat off to anonymous.
It affects crypto: it means that one published signature is
not sufficient to provide a provable relationship between a signed
message and a public key.  You have to provide two signatures.
For example anonymous provide three signatures which check with that
key (one is self sig on the key).  Therefore it is not possible for
someone to do the same attack again against his published signatures:
they could match any one of the signatures, but no more.
It may even be that there exist crypto protocols affected by this.

Kudos anonymous!
What form are your primes (did you use Maurers idea to increase the
relative hardness of factoring compared to discrete log, or did you
just use more smaller primes?)  How many primes have you used, and how
many CPU hours did it take to calculate the discrete log to discover e?
Also is the code for finding discrete logs given the prime
factorisation of the modulus available?
Obvious counter-measures to this attack on a persistent anonymous
identity are to post more than one signature, or to sign the public
key (as would happen with a self signed PGP public key).
I am left wondering if there are implications of this demonstration
for other protocols (*) involving RSA signatures, where one signed
message is observed before the key is obtained.
- For example, the general case of receiving a message signed by
someone, not having the public key, and looking up the public key on a
key server by keyid (as pgp5.x, and some pgp2.x mail interfaces
automate).  With an anonymous individual (and with many peoples keys
where they have poor connection in the web of trust) all you are
aiming to do is to send a message to the author of a given message.
With this attack an attacker who could intercept the key server
lookup, and return an alternate public key with associated
certificates which would match the signature.
Are there other protocols where this attack would have implications?
(* Toto's impromptu 'protocol' was publishing one signature only, and
then having his machine seized containing the public (and private?)
keys which arguably created the signature).  The result of the
identity attack is that Toto's (currently unwanted) proof of
authorship has been called into question.

@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source code) 
That concisely says what is wrong with GPL for the purposes of crypto
deployment to head off government key grabbing attempts.  It is a
license virus.  A license virus with this aim: to propogate the
license allowing free access to source code, and (the killer for
crypto deployment!!) propogating the provision that anyone has the
ability to re-sell any source code based on GNU source code.
The negative implications of GPL don't hit you until you are involved
in actually trying to create some commercial software.  Try it, and
you quickly realise that all that GNU software is useless for the
commercial people's purposes.
Consider: GNU says that all of their source must be GNUed if any of
the code you use is.  So now they have a GNU license on their
software, and the other provision of the license means that anyone is
allowed to take the software they are selling and re-sell it!  It is
indeed no wonder that their lawyers have fits.
(There is a difference between GNU and GNU Library.  GNU library allows
you to use a library without infecting your entire software.  GNU
library is sort of usable.)
I used to be quite pro-GNU until I tried this exercise (writing
commercial crypto software for software companies) and ended up
re-writing huge tracts of stuff just to remove the GNU license virus.
This extra expense, hassle, etc likely kills many commercial crypto
projects, and the whole aim of the game is to encourage commercial
people to add crypto to their software.  This aim often conflicts with
RMS/FSF's aims.
I have from time to time proposed the idea of a `cypherpunks license'
which embodies cypherpunk goals, as distinct from RMS's particular
concept of `free source', noble tho' this aim is, it conflicts with
the crypto deployment aim, which for many of us takes precedence. (GNU
source is actually highly restricted source -- but it guarantess that
you can get it, and stops other people preventing you from getting
source for derived works).
All stuff I have written (non-commercially) so far has been PD.
(Actually I don't even dignify it with a `this is PD' note -- I
personally have zip respect for copyright, patents, licenses).
However, perhaps one could do one better than PD: restrict use to
propogate cypherpunk goals.  eg. - You may not use this code in software which provides government back
And perhaps, as a condition of the license the software should display
some anti-GACK slogan :-), or a URL for a site with lots of
documentation on key grabbing attempts, clipper I - IV, ECHELON, etc.
And perhaps:
- secret service agencies can not use this software / or must pay
exorbitant license fees
Agree, same experience here.
I was saying to Werner in email that SSLeay is probably the most
widely used crypto package in both commercial and non-commercial
software.  I suggested that if you had used GPL, the commercial use
would have been greatly hindered.  You backed this up above.
btw. I consider this discussion is highly topical for coderpunks --
the license put on software hugely impacts it's value, and coderpunks
was originally intended (by it's proposers) to provide a lower noise
environment for cypherpunks interested in code.  Of late it appears to me that coderpunks has almost lost interest in
it's cypherpunk origins -- few to none of the comments relate to
creating crypto code to further a political aim.  `cypherpunks write
code ...' for a reason, and I suspect some coderpunks have lost sight
of that reason, or perhaps many have joined more recently and never
had sight of it, crypto coding being just a job to them.
In all it might seem even that coderpunks has had a negative impact on
the amount of crypto coding happening -- it ciphoned off coders who
had been active on cypherpunks into a low volume, apolitical mailing
list where nothing much happens, and propsed projects quickly die.
The role of the coderpunks retro-moderators, though well meaning of
course, I think has not helped either, in that even questions about
export (surely relevant for usefulness of code) are flagged as

Problem: it's rather easy to hack, would take some fraction of a
second to try all 10,000 pin numbers, although if the check is online,
they could disable the card after 3 tries or so.
Still the problem persists: attacker obtains (or generates) valid (or
possibly valid) credit card numbers, uses up the 3 tries on each card
number, and moves onto the next number.  They will get a sucess every
3,333 card numbers on average.  (This attack is as a by-product going
to annoy a lot of people who have their cards disabled as a result.)
Artificial delays won't work because the attacker can parallelise via
multiple IP addresses on card numbers and PINs in randomised
So because of the inherent naffness of ATM security, you are stuffed.
David Birch suggested that the European smart card based credit/debit
cards (EMV cards) would be better because they are more secure.
However this has the start up cost of a smart-card reader, and
violates the requirement for instant, accountless (and especially
hardwareless) use.
Ideas for beefing up ATM PIN based security using existing hardware
(deployed Cards and PINs), to get it to an acceptable level of
security with a low enough user interaction overhead.

@_subject: GPL & commercial software, the critical distinction 
There are two distinct licenses promoted by the FSF.  They are the GNU
GPL (General Public License) and the GNU LGPL (Library General Public
As you suggest the LGPL is usuable.
However Werner Koch's GNUPG (OpenPGP implementation) uses GPL (not
LGPL) -- or at least it did in version 10-0.0.0, which is the source
tree I have here.
So the comment was on Werner's license, and use of GPL in general for
crypto code, which started this discussion when he offered that it
contained a GPLed Twofish implementation, when Bruce Schneier asked if
anyone had Public Domain implementations in various languages.  (Not
matching Bruce's PD requirement, note).
I did make this distinction in my 2nd post on this topic:
: (There is a difference between GNU and GNU Library.  GNU library allows
: you to use a library without infecting your entire software.  GNU
: library is sort of usable.)
Yes.  My point is to highlight for those writing crypto code with the
aim of crypto deployment NOT to use GPL, but preferably (in my view)
PD, BSD, or lastly LGPL.
I went on to suggest half-seriously a "cypherpunk license" which
restricted use of the code to code without government back doors.

@_subject: Why GNU GPL is bad for crypto deployment 
Someone asked me in email why I said on coderpunks & cypherpunks:
And as I wrote a longish explanation, I thought I'd share it:
Here is problem: say that our goal is to maximise deployment of
software with crypto built in, especially commercial software.
So people write libraries, and software say like Eric Young's SSLeay,
or Werner Koch's GNUGP (OpenPGP implementation).
Some of these people then use GNU license because that is the friendly
net ethos of the way to do it.  (And in general I agree, but there is
a conflict here...)
So now the license on the libraries or software that they've written
(specifically to encourage commercial companies to add crypto) are
evaluated by the prospective companies lawyers.
The lawyer observes that, GNU license says:
1) thou shalt adopt the GNU license for your whole source tree, if
there is one line of GNU derived code in it.
(or words to effect).
And he goes ... hmmm ... so what else does GNU license say if we put
our source under GNU license.
It also says:
2) source shall be available for shipping and handling fee only
(or words to effect)
and he grumbles, and maybe causes the project to be scrapped, if the
company has ideas on keeping source code secret (though we all know
this is not a good idea especially for crypto code, such companies
exist, these the parameters we are mostly working within).
so if the project is still ok by the lawyer, he examines the license
some more, and it says:
3) it shall be allowed for anyone to take and re-distribute any GNU
software charging what they like.
(or words to effect)
And he goes (floating point exception... core dumped!)  Because it
means that his companies software can be legally copied and re-sold
with no financial benefit to his company.
Which is why companies won't touch GNU license stuff with a barge
Note that there are two licenses promoted by FSF: the GPL (GNU General
Public License) and the GNU LGPL (GNU Library General Public License).
The GNU LGPL is as I commented in an earlier post just about usable
for commercial purposes, because it does not infect the source tree
using the code with the LGPL (or GPL) because it allows specifically
for providing only the code for the library and not the rest of the
code, and does not demand that the rest of the code use the same
However Werner is using GPL for G10 aka GNUPG (at least as of
g10-0.0.0 which is the version I have).
So the plea is, if you are going to use GNU, at least use GLPL and NOT
Well, it's your code, and you wrote it, so it's your choice: my
comments are based on the assumption that the author is more
interested in crypto deployment than in the GNU license virus as a
means of promoting the availability of source code.

@_subject: Toto -- mimic function or the real thing (Re: no subject) 
Dunno, but that sure looks like authentic Toto doesn't it (and the
rest of the long post of which excerpt quoted above).  Either someone
has a very high quality mimic function for his writing style, or is
rather good at imitating his writing style manually, or Toto is still
around, and Toto isn't Carl Johnson.
Who knows, if it is Toto, he has been rather careful not to sign
anything recently :-).
(If he were to sign things it might be helpful for Carl
Johnson... Toto?)

@_subject: cypherpunk license: PLEASE STEAL ME (Re: GPL & commercial software, the critical distinction) (fwd) 
Yes, I know, I have read LGPL a few times, and it does include the
sorts of exceptions you describe.  But I said GPL, and GPL is the
license which I was suggesting causes problems.  As I said, LGPL is
sort of useable.
Right, this is the major sticking point for commercial people I find.
Yes, but the more interesting, less restrictive case is where they
really want to modify the code.  cf the example I gave of say adding
pgp5 compatibility to pgp26ui.
I think that if you modify to any significant extent a GPL peice of
software, and try to sell it you could run into problems.  Your legal
bill for trying to work out how bad it is will be expensive.  If the
company is not that bothered about adding crypto, they are going to
see the implications in lawyer hours alone, and give up before they
If you want to be creative, you could do what you want to it ignoring
the license, then provide a binary patch from their binary to your
binary.  Or whatever.  Commercial lawyers are cautious animals though,
so because you could theoretically hack around things does not mean
that some company's lawyer is going to recommend that they do it.
Simpler, rather than hack around, and have the additional hurdle to
crypto deployment of many lawyer hours spent wrangling over
implications of GPL and hacks around it, is to discourage use of GPL
for crypto libraries, and software.
That aspect of LGPL (availability of source) is useful to the extent
that it encourages people to make source of the crypto parts
Use of GNU development tools is a different, and more straight forward
issue than using GNU licensed code.
The point remains: the simplest and best thing to do about licenses if
you are more concerned about crypto deployment than source
availability is not to use GPL, and probably to avoid LGPL also.
Use BSD, use PD, either is better than GPL for the purpose.

Ah come on, it isn't that bad.  Just put it on a crypto site with some
dumb revolving password scheme, or give it to someone else to put no
theirs.  It'll be on replay with-in a few hours, if anyone is
interested in the code.
Also you seem happy using remailers, so you could as easily publish

@_subject: Toto -- mimic function or the real thing (Re: no subject) 
It wasn't perfect Toto, but it's the best one we've seen yet, I think.
Writing style appears to be hard to mimic, or at least I find it hard.
Toto I think is harder to mimic than most, his style is very
distinctive, but somehow still hard to mimic.
We have seen high quality John Young mimics, which would pass as the
real thing.  But there seems to be something harder about Toto's
I had a go at mimicing Toto for posting to the list (anonymously), but
the output was so obviously not Toto that I scrapped it and deleted
And this is just manual writing style analysis.  NSA letter triple
based analysis, one presumes would be much better.
btw. I suspected a couple of the anonymous replies to one of the
spammers / AOLers looked a bit like Tim May writing style.  (The one
with lots of ! in them -- perhaps it is that Klaus von Future prime!
likes exclamation marks).
I have been thinking about this problem on and off, as it is a problem
for nyms (especially where the true name has been rather vocal already
to provide lots of samples) and I invite comments on the merits of the
following as an approach to reducing leakage of writing style:
Create a multiple choice sentence constructor (say CGI web page with
pull down menus for subject, verb, adjective etc).  Plus text boxes
for less common nouns, names etc.
Apparently during the war soldiers were handed post cards where one
could tick a few boxes ("[ ] I am doing ok / [ ] I blah") for some
Seems the formally restricted choice of adjectives etc would be less
expresive but perhaps go some reasonable way to frustrate writing
