John, et. al.,
I realize my email settings obscured my name in the previous post.
Didn't mean to be mysterious.
As usual, your questions are perceptive, provocative and mischievous. I
respectfully beg off. You know, opsec. I haven't said what materials I
have, and I've said all I want about when and how I talked to Snowden
here:  Unless someone puts a hood on me, you'll
know if a subpoena comes my way. Also, Hersh and Ellsberg don't need
subpoenas. They have super powers.
