Nope. Unfortunately it does not. Deriving the geographical location from
an IP address and a DNS name is not always feasible. There are a couple of
big ISPs (UUNet/Worldcom comes to mind) which have allocated huge chunks
of IP space which then get re-allocated to their regional providers in
different countries. Of course there is some scheme involved in this process
which could be reversed to get to the geographical location, however it will
not always be readily apparent how it works.
What one could do however is have the remailer pass on every message which
has a recipient address that is *known to be in a jurisdiction that is different
from the remailers*. You will not be able to reach each and every target
then, but at least it's better than nothing.
On the other hand I remember that the Curch of Scientology was able to
have an impact on anon.penet.fi despite the fact that this remailer was outside
of US jurisdiction. Maybe we have to come up with a list of "incompatible"
jurisdiction systems to avoid this sort of thing from happening again.

There are at least two more ideas that come to mind here.
The first would be to embed links in your spam messages which take you
sites that you have previously set up which contain a high amount of graphics.
You could then hide the data steganographically in those images. Of course
an automated tool of retrieval for those sites would be handy then as well
(say a browser plugin which scans images tries to extract data out of each
image and only accepts the extracted information if it has been signed with
a previously agreed on key -- i favour a browse plugin over a commandline
tool cause it would maybe look a little bit suss if somebody mirrored a
'become-a-millionaire-in-two-weeks'-website with wget or similar tools).
You might also want to have a look at MP3Stego, a tool which allows hiding
of information in MP3 files.
URL: Sending someone a couple of megs of non-copyrighted mp3s (say bolivian
folklore) should not raise too much suspicion, or better yet, just mail him
links to some geocities account where he can download them instead of sending
them directly.
Any method for data transfer can be used for steganography -- just be creative.

@_subject: CDR: Re: europe physical meeting 
sounds ok. has anyone heard what happened to the RSA patent expiration
party on sept 20, that was supposed to take place in amsterdam btw ?
hmm.. we're still talking about hamburg here, right ? you're right in so
far as since this is the first european cypherpunk meeting one can have
absolutely no idea how many people will be showing. depending on how well
announced the meeting is i'd guess > 50 people however (maybe the bay area
people can give us a rough count on how much people are showing to an averge
meeting there and we can try to extrapolate something from that - cultural
difference nonwithstanding :)... there were physical meetings in non-west-coast
places as well, dunno remember where however. the numbers for those should be a little bit more of a benchmark/pointer to us).
A cafe sounds like a good idea, we might try meeting at a mall, on a public
place or somewhere else however.
still thinking about that. i have a couple of topics in mind. will post
to the list after further re-consideration.
let's get things kicking!

I totally agree. They are fucking up the party schedule!
Bloody bastards.
Those 2 weeks sure would have made a real difference in royalty
income I suppose :)
I'd have had respect for them had they done it a year early.
