So far, I've seen DES software from a couple of U.S. companies. The question
is "Is it the U.S. domestic DES or "export flavored" DES? As for the hardware,
would'nt it be inconsistant if the DES supplied is the Domestic DES?
I know DES as a subject here is one big YAWN, but for guys like us in the
Asia, it's not. Why? 'Cause the US crypto companies here in Asia keep telling us about how good and wonderful and secure DES is, and that it is THE standard
used by the American Banking Association. whether it's been broken, URLs..ect...
" You can fool some people all the time......"

@_subject: CyberCash just did it! 
Out of curiousity I visited their site and I read the part of the security
section which I've pasted below. Is it true? After all that I've read about
the export issue and here Cybercash tells me they have got permission to
export strong crypto? Please note that I am not someone who is familiar with
the strength of crypto algo and any response to this post would be most helpful
to a newbie in this business. Thanks.
Quote from Cybercash's web page :  " CyberCash transactions are protected by a powerful and sophisticated
   system of encryption, combining DES private-key and RSA public-key    encryption technologies. In fact, CyberCash's 768-bit RSA key encryption
   capability is unique in that it is the most powerful encryption technology
   currently licensed by the United States government for export. CyberCash    also has been approved by the government for 1024-bit RSA key encryption,
   and will be providing that technology by the end of 1996. "

Dear C'punks
I understand from a previous post that if I were to commercialised PGP in a package, I have to pay some
royalties(?) to the owners(?) of IDEA. My apologies to the list for repeating the question which is, who
do I pay to and how much.

@_subject: RSA 1024bit Key for Export 
Just a short question :
What is the exportable maximum key length of RSA if
use for encrypting session keys? My local Cylink VAR
in Malaysia says it is 1024bit for encrypting the
Omega algo.
Comments and advice appreciated.

Is'nt there a alt.philosophy in the news group? Perhaps it would be more
