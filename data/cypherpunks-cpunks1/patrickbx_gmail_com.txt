@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot Data Overhead 
I made a blog post  on
the Guardian site about the data cost incurred by Orbot usage. It generally
seems quite manageable for most use cases. Running in the backround 24/7
for 30 days does incur ~200MB of idle usage which would be significant for
mobile users with smaller data plans. Check out the post for more details.
I'm also curious if anyone has taken similar measurements with Tor to
compare the results.
