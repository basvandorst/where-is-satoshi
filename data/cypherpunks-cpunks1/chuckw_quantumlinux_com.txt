Where N is a natural number? How do they define "progression"? Depending on that definition, there are some trivial counter examples.

Which witch is which... Ohio is still in play, all the rest are pretty much decided. Ohio has 120,000-ish provisional ballots and about 300,000 regular votes yet to be counted. The spread is about 120,000 in favor of

*SIGH* Is it really so hard for people to remember that George W. Bush was born and educated in Massachusetts? John F. Kerry is more southerner than

I think a little line noise crept in here somewhere. Care to clarify?

"&cet" is an HTMl element, I ass-u-me-d that some HTML garbage was injected into your message. May I assume you meant "etc." ? In that case, yes, I'm familiar with the maxim you *meant* to say.

Strange, you called that a rudimentary part of modern culture. Are you aware of any territories outside of that which the queen et. al. has Bad form. Rude and dismissive. Tsk tsk. I guess it's a good way of redirecting the argument when you're getting desperate though...

@_subject: Gilmore case...Who can make laws? 
Well, there's the "Executive Order", as well as the fact that many organizations are empowered to create "policy". Although policy is not specifically law, it may as well be. I am curious though:
1) Can the laws that grant policy making privileges be themselves secret?
2) Are policy making privilege laws restricted within a certain scope (within a specific organization)?
3) Are all *SIGNED* executive orders publically available?
