@_subject: Weekly Checks... 
If you would like to have checks of $1,000 and up sent to you ON A WEEKLY BASIS, then call this number. If not, then I'm sorry to bother you.
ALL YOU DO IS PASS OUT THIS 800 NUMBER, NOTHING ELSE.
The company sends you a check every week.
The company does all the work and you get paid for it.
If you can get the 800 number out there, as I am doing, then YOU WILL
MAKE thousands per month. Simple as that. You have nothing to lose by calling to get more information.
You will be asked for ID  when you call.
(Live operators are available from 8 AM-10 PM CST Monday through Saturday and will be able to answer any questions you may have.)
Call one of the 24hr TESTIMONIAL lines at 888-703-5389, 888-446-6949, 888-446-6951
