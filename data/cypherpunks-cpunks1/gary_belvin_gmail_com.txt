@_subject: [HacDC:Byzantium] USAID Tech Challenge 
It's been a while since I've checked back in with HacDc, and I'm impressed with the progress Byzantium has made. There's a tech challenge  from  and USAID opening in Feburary that a few of you might be interested in. Here's the problem description.:
During acute crises, vulnerable populations are often *cut off from Which basically sounds close enough to Byzantium to be worth applying for. Let me know if anyone has interest. Some side questions for the tech folks:     Does Byzantium work across non WiFi IP stacks?  Would it be reasonable to attach it to Packet Radio over HAM radio?
