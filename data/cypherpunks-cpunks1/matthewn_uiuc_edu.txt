The Unicop's here at the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana) are
actually state troopers.  This way they have no jurisdiction problems
between the two seperate local (C-U) jurisdictions.

@_subject: How do *I* use PGP? 
It has been my belief that there isn't an effective way for me to use PGP, but with all the hubbub, I thought it might be worthwhile to verify this.
My internet access is through a personal account provided by my employer. It is on a machine used exclusively by employees of the University of
Illinois (no student accounts). My primary access to this account is through my IBM xt (dos 3.3) at work. This machine is occasionally used by others and is outside of my control. I also use many of the public access Win/Mac machines on campus. I have no pc of my very own.
Is there an effective way for me to use PGP?

I read my mail with pine on my account.
I think the login excerpt below answers your other question.

Person A requests information from Group C. Person B is a member of Group C.
Person B does not ignore Person A.
Person B does not speak with Person A.
Person B responds to Person A by addressing Group C.
If the last sentence I quoted is true, then why tell _us_ why he won't release the information.

Sorry to mail this twice, but I realized I munged the attributions, and
wanted to get it right.
