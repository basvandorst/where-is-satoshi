It is now possible to send outgoing mail via the alias remailer at
alpha.c2.org.  To send a message, create a message of the following
Password: mypass
This is my message.
Encrypt this with the public key for the remailer and send it to
alias at alpha.c2.org.  It will decrypt it and send your message
(after verifying and removing the password line.)
