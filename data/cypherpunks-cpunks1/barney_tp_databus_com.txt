My use of "anonym" was a joke.  Sorry if it was too deadpan.  But
my serious point was that if a pseudonym costs nothing to get or
give up, it makes one effectively anonymous, if one so chooses.

Do you really mean that if I'm a business, you can force me to deal with
you even though you refuse to supply your real name?  Not acceptable.
I won't give up the right NOT to do business with anonymous customers,
or anyone else with whom I choose not to do business.
The point about DRM, if I understand it, is that you could disclose
your information to me for certain purposes without my being able
to make use of it in ways you have not agreed to.  At least in
theory.  But this debate appears largely to ignore differences in
the number of bits involved.  To violate your privacy I can always
take a picture of my screen with an old camera, or just read it
into a tape-recorder.  I can't do that effectively with your new DVD
without significant loss of quality.
I don't see any technical solution that would enable Alice to reveal
something to Bob that Bob could not then reveal to Eve.  If that's
true, then DRM must stand on its own dubious merits.

The trouble I have with this is that I'm not only a consumer, I'm
also a merchant, selling my own professional services.  And I just
will not, ever, perform services for an anonymous client.  That's
my choice, and the gov't will take it away only when they can pry
it from my cold dead fingers. :)  It's not that I hate my govt,
although I liked it a whole lot better before 1/20/01, but I will
not risk aiding and abetting criminality, even if I can pretend I
don't know I'm doing it.
Oh by the way, last time you visited your favorite kinky sex shop,
didn't you notice the surveillance camera in the corner?  And didn't
you see the cashier at your ${house_of_worship} last ${sabbath}?
The right to anonymity seems to be a new one, not a traditional one
that we're about to lose.  It may be a needed defense against the
ever-increasing ability to correlate data.  All I'm really railing
against is the notion that just because I'm selling something I MUST
accept your anonymity.
I certainly agree that DRM cannot protect privacy violation by a
user with access rights.
The whole issue of database correlation and anonymity was insightfully
explored by Heinlein in "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" in 1966.

A pseudonym that I can give up at will and that can never afterwards
be traced to me is equivalent to an anonym.
I'm not suggesting that anonymity be outlawed, or that every merchant
be required to reject anonymous or pseudonymous customers.  All I'm
suggesting is that "small" merchants MUST NOT be required to accept
such customers.
