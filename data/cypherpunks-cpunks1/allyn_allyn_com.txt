@_subject: New payment scheme for Web access 
You say:
"...........  a very popular site could allow access only to domains
(....foo.bar) that have paid instead of blocking those who have not,
otherwise 'new' sites could circumvent it easily. On the other hand,
a proxy server inside of an allowed domain would circumvent the allowing
kind of scheme, at least for a while (until they found out about it).
Great opportunities for hacking wars.
Another payment scheme in use is to recieve passwords for closed
Web pages by voice phoning to an expensive number........."
First of all, if they block on domains; then it is only a matter
of stealing the domain. The DNS naming system is a joke for this.
Say, you want to steal my own domain; allyn.com so you can go into
the expensive pay per view web site which will allow allyn.com.
All you need to do is to change your DNS reverse lookup records
(the records which map your IP address to your name) so that
when the web site does a reverse DNS lookup at IP address
100.200.3.4 (or whatever your real IP address is); it will return
allyn.com. If you have your own name servers, this should be easy.
Further; knowing the lack of security at Internic; you could probably
go all the way and steal control of the actual domain.
The password method is a joke. A bunch of hackers get together
and chip in for the cost of one password. Then they share it.
Or, the could resort to the old fashioned social engineering
methods that have been long discussed in such forums as 2600
and other places.
Of course, this all is for discussion purposes only. You have your
own concience to live with. Can you really look at yourself in the mirror and sleep at night
knowing that  you stole something? I certainly can't. Once I accidentally
walked out of the corner store with a candy bar when I was a little
boy without paying for it. When I reached the house, I discovered that I had the candy bar in my hand and I **RAN** crying back to the store and
put it back on the shelf.

I happen to be a sysadmin for a zillion servers and groups

overtime fixing them, Gordon, my manager demands to know why. I will
honestly tell him what is happening. If it was because of a protest, I would tell him. Knowing him, he would probably want to look at

Jack Rickard says:
Yes, this is a far more significant issue than most ISPs realize - whether
the FCC, in both responding to the Apple-WINForum proposal to allocate
350Mhz of spectrum in the 5Ghz bands for what the FCC dubbed the "NII/SUPERNET" Band for 'no licence' wireless - will do that in BOTH
the 'wireless lan' segment AS WELL AS the requested '15 km' segments
and thus permit anyone, including ISPs to have no-comm cost bandwidth
up to 2Mbps between two points, or, with relay, 1Mbps (above and
below T-1) for the cost of the radios. Spread spectrum technology which
is a revolution in radio communications (wide band, digital processor
controlled low power - with no practical interference versus traditional
narrow frequency band high power - with so much interferecne, the frquencies have to be licenced and highly controlled).
And yes I, and a too-small handful of others are deep into the issues
at the FCC level as the decision hangs in the balance. Because I
am the Principal Investigator on the $375,700 'Wireless Field Test
for Education Project' I was invited to a roundtable with FCC
Commissioners nominally debating 'wireless for education' two weeks
ago, and, using our real-world wireless project going on in the
San Luis Valley (one school being relaibaly connected now 15 miles
at 115kbs, bypassing US West, from NT-Lan router to Cisco Router
at the POP. Zero local loop cost) and reporting on the other
projects we have examined (8 Belen, New Mexico Schools, conected
T-1 between each other in a WAN - up to 10 miles across the district.
Zero local loop cost (which would normally run $84,000 a year wiht
telco T-1 between schools).
We made an impression, but know what giant forces we are up against.
Some FCC staffers want to 'auction' the longer range (even 15km)
stuff. Some big communications companies, led by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn - CTIA, would like all 'no-licence'
that can compete with them to be killed. Our arguements, that got a few thinking anyway, was that IF the FCC
rules permit radios to be made which go 15-45 miles, no licence,
no interference, and solve the problem of the 16,000 school
districts whose biggest problem is the cost of bandwidth *between*
school building of a district first, then the cost from the main
hub to the POP, second, then between the student and/or teacher
at home to the school, at 56kbs or above, THEN the problem of
'community' networking will also be solved. For school districts
are coincident where people live and log on from. (ditto ISPs)
We turned a few heads when I showed my calcuations that, if
the 14 School Districts of the SanLuis Valley are connected to
the one central POP at T-1 by US West, it will cost $1.2 million
over 10 years. If by T-1 25mile radios (yeas they exist now)
it will cost $173,000 for the same 10 years. Now if ISPs want to strike a blow for economic telecom freedom, you can start by accessing our NSF Wireless Field Test web site,
   and go into the Regulatory section
where you will find direct documents, links to the FCC, the
Belen Paper, and my long but piercing piece 'The Case for Public Spectrum' (and if you are a skeptic about the technology,
read the Paul Baran short papers - the invetor of packet switching)
Then all you have to do to sumbit public comments o the NIIBand
matter is to email:
            96-102 at fcc.gov
and that is the email address for the Docket Item. You *must* comment
before July 15th, or yours will not be considered. (but under the law
and regulation, if you *do* comment, your comments must be summarized
by the staff and presented to the COmmissioners with the staff views. You do NOT have to comment on all the heavy duty technical issues.
Right from the chief FCC Engineer who drafts the rules, and was
the father of the original Spread Spectrum rules in 1985 he
says that your statemnt of what you NEED, and why, would be
much appreciated. As simple as 'I am an ISP who needs T-1 from
my site, 8 miles to the nearest POP, no licence/cost wirless,
with a radio I can afford' is to the point. (of course the more
you show your technical economic need in sophisticated terms
the better it will be received. The FCC engineers are no dummies
and political handwaving doesn't impress them (it only impresses
the COmmissioners whenthe handwavers are called AT&T or Congress)
I can just about assure you the FCC staff doesn't even know you
exist, as a class, (small ISPs) or what function you serve in the
food chain, or why you shouldn't just pay $650 a month for your
local loop T-1 like anybody else. And unless you email them
(and they now have a policy that email must be taken as seriously
as formal paper mail filings), your colective case won't even
be mentioned when the likes of Motorola, AT&T, CTIA, the NSA
(who gets gas pains when secure wireless is mentioned) are
All will not be totally lost if this NPRM does not fly (new
spectrum) for we still have the more congested Part 15, 1 watt
bands. And the 4 NSF types who attended the FCC rountable
were impressed enough with our case that we spent a day with them
and they are about to fund a 'developmental' project that will
be done by TAPR, that may bring you that $500 T-1 plug and play
radio, with range. (by licencing the guts to mfgrs).
Matter of fact I will be in Washington DC at the NSF Monday
on this (being carrie dby my sidekick in radio engineering
matters) and two other matters. One of which will (their idea,
not ours) see part of our team in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in
August, linking 8 sites to the satellite Spintlink downlink
site run by Mongolian engineers in an old Soviet lab. (web
page at  already - but they can't get the signal
across town, so crappy is their phone system). So by September
you willbe pinging systems in Mongolia, the last 10km of
which will be wireless.
I always wanted to help set up the Ghengis Khan BBS in a Mongolian
yurt, running OS2 (cause IBM is everywhere), with NAPLPS character
sets (Chinese, Cyrilli Russian, and Mongolian - none of which
are ascii), solar powered, and with spread spectrum radios
linking China to Russia. With nary a Telco in a hundred miles.
And I got a hunch I will have that done before ISPs in NYC
do it.

Oh yeah, if you   you will reach, by wireless,
the OS2 system in my home. Not blazingly fast beacause I
am trying out a different set of radios. And teh wired 56kbs
frame relay to which it is attached is actuallythe slowest link
in the chain. But its been running 160kbs for almost a year now,
for $0 cost from me to my own Internet service.

@_subject: Truelly Random Numbers 
Here is a good idea for random numbers:
Take a piece of non conducting board, say about six by six
feet. Put electrodes on it; say a pair of electrodes every
quarter inch or so across and down. Each pair of electrodes would be connected to logic so that
it generates a unique number. When the electrodes are shorted,
the number would be generated.
Put this contraption out in the rain. As raindrops fall on the board with electrodes, the water would
conduct and short the electrodes. Rain falls in a totally random manner. As raindrops hit the electrodes, they would momentarily short and cause a number
to be generated. Yout would get a random series of numbers. Now, as it does not rain in the same place all the time, a
network of these rain random generators could be set up troughout
the land and be hooked up on the Internet. Each one would be
sort of a rain random number server. These servers would cooperate.
They would notify each other when one has rain raining on it and another one would not.
We could have a series of master servers, or dispatcher. The dispatchers
would work cooperatively and collectively know which rain random generator has rain raining on it and is generating random numbers.
It would be up to the client, who is needing random numbers to access
the rain random generators that are operating. All of this could be done in real time using current client server
technology. In fact, since it is allways raining in more than one part of the world at any given time, many rain random generator servers would
be available at any time. The master servers, or dispatchers, would
have a constant running list of active generators.
What do you all think?
